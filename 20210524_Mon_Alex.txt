[00:00.000 --> 00:29.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, 24th, 2021
[00:29.600 --> 00:40.060]  and as we speak the live headline for today's broadcast, teleprompter free, is going up on
[00:40.060 --> 00:49.800]  the front page of infowars.com and newswars.com and that headline says it all, very succinctly.
[00:49.800 --> 00:55.440]  Alex Jones issues an emergency message to humanity.
[00:55.440 --> 01:01.880]  The globalist population plan has gone from beta and is now successfully launched into
[01:01.880 --> 01:06.640]  operational.
[01:06.640 --> 01:19.760]  The in-game goal is the complete extermination of all humans on earth by the year 2050, the
[01:19.760 --> 01:28.840]  very complex operation and all the timetables that you see publicly now as they externalize
[01:28.840 --> 01:35.480]  the method and the hierarchy are projecting it out to 2070, but it's official all humans
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.800]  dead by then, so that minions in the system who think they're going to be part of the
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.920]  life extension program, they're going to merge with the silicon body as is the cost of immortality
[01:46.920 --> 01:54.720]  they're being told by the dark force, by the bad guy, so they don't figure out they've
[01:54.720 --> 02:03.720]  been set up the entire time and are the biggest fools of all and so that really is the plan
[02:03.720 --> 02:10.800]  and people now are watching stuff I said 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five
[02:10.800 --> 02:16.120]  years ago, two years ago and they're going man the stuff he said back then sounded crazy
[02:16.120 --> 02:21.920]  but it's all happening exactly as he said and then the even crazier stuff he's saying
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.280]  now is accelerating and you don't have to wait 20 years for it to come true you can
[02:27.280 --> 02:34.160]  wait six months and it's true and as this accelerates towards 2050 that's a very conservative
[02:34.160 --> 02:38.400]  estimate they may go ahead and just launch the whole thing and kill everybody by 2030
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.680]  that's my dead reckoning analysis from their statements their operations kind of an internal
[02:42.680 --> 02:53.320]  biological algorithm I've got to kind of triangulate their both public and private propaganda
[02:53.320 --> 03:00.480]  to kind of mathematically create an average but that could be a deception as well the
[03:00.480 --> 03:08.280]  point is they're killing the whole planet this is a planet killing system but it's going
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.720]  to be done very very slowly and clearly out of it there is a metamorphosis something climbs
[03:13.720 --> 03:27.040]  out of it but it ain't us and it ain't pretty and it really is a ritualistic destruction
[03:27.040 --> 03:33.560]  of humanity and all that is pure and all that is beautiful and all that is good so if you
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.720]  ask why they're doing it it's the same reason you ask why does a serial killer grab a five
[03:37.720 --> 03:41.800]  year old girl out of her backyard and take her to a barn and rape her for two days and
[03:41.800 --> 03:47.600]  slit her throat because they like it and a lot of people say well don't worry about
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.000]  why the globalists do what they do just stop them well no the general public can't fight
[03:52.000 --> 04:00.720]  the enemy because they project the fact that they're not like that onto the enemy and so
[04:00.720 --> 04:07.840]  people just can't interface with it and then it's invisible and so it can overtake you
[04:07.840 --> 04:19.360]  you have to face it so that you know the cut of its jib as they would say so that you know
[04:19.360 --> 04:25.640]  it can really feel where this is going and see where it's going and then activate your
[04:25.640 --> 04:32.080]  own spirit which is designed to stomp this into the ground very easily once you become
[04:32.080 --> 04:40.200]  conscious and of course they believe they're involved in a metaphysical alchemy transcending
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.440]  themselves by destroying humanity but in truth they will just only test the faithful and it
[04:45.440 --> 04:51.200]  is us that will transcend this entire fallen planet and that is the great secret that they
[04:51.200 --> 04:55.800]  try to keep from their minds that they are the fallen they are the servants of the devil
[04:55.800 --> 05:01.760]  so they don't see the truth listen up patriots I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've
[05:01.760 --> 05:06.360]  ever run on three products that are already selling out well then why am I selling it
[05:06.360 --> 05:11.160]  then at 50% off or 60% off depending on which sale you go with because I know a lot of you
[05:11.160 --> 05:14.360]  are on the fence you haven't tried it and I know you're gonna get hooked once you do
[05:14.360 --> 05:21.160]  it so for one week only we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil 50% off on winter
[05:21.160 --> 05:26.000]  sun with D3 and K-3 immune system and oh my gosh people love this so much but sold out
[05:26.000 --> 05:32.080]  for months back in limited supply turbo force 10 hour clean energy is 40% off but you can
[05:32.080 --> 05:38.320]  get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack for 60% off we've never offered
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.480]  that on these products it's basically a lost leader I want you to get them I want you to
[05:42.480 --> 05:48.600]  get trying I want you to love them so believe me you're gonna be a blown away go to infowarstore.com
[05:48.600 --> 05:53.440]  we're running this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over best deal ever take advantage
[05:53.440 --> 06:15.840]  of it at infowarstore.com and find the info war from the front lines of the information
[06:15.840 --> 06:31.400]  war it's Alex Jones when I was really becoming politically aware 30 years ago I was graduating
[06:31.400 --> 06:37.920]  high school and already had a big grasp on general history because I'd become a novice
[06:37.920 --> 06:45.080]  history buff because I thought it's so interesting and was attracted to it and it became very
[06:45.080 --> 06:48.320]  clear as I began to research history that there were always elites that believe they
[06:48.320 --> 06:53.760]  were gods and believe the general public were chatteling animals that had to be controlled
[06:53.760 --> 07:03.800]  and culled from time to time and then very soon I began to dig in to their end game and
[07:03.800 --> 07:13.520]  the fact that all the major robber bear and money and royal cashier had been put in to
[07:13.520 --> 07:19.400]  a project for world government and how to control humanity and how to have a monopoly
[07:19.400 --> 07:23.840]  of power and of course what else does royalty and rich people want they want to live longer
[07:23.840 --> 07:33.880]  live forever and and and out of that project came the Carnegie endowment for peace which
[07:33.880 --> 07:41.520]  by the 30s said the answers world government and ending biologically humans as we know
[07:41.520 --> 07:48.600]  them and making them a corporate production of laboratories if we even decide to keep
[07:48.600 --> 08:05.320]  humans around the answer is transcendence above our humanity and so we're like an egg
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.960]  the white part of the egg and you have the center of the egg that is actually the fertilized
[08:09.960 --> 08:21.640]  embryo that then absorbs out of the white part of the egg its sustenance to then crack
[08:21.640 --> 08:29.200]  out of the egg with its little egg tooth and stumble out upon a new universe imprinting
[08:29.200 --> 08:35.240]  and identifying on the first thing it sees well the globalist imprinted on state that
[08:35.240 --> 08:39.480]  was the first thing they were able to make contact with the thing that would go after
[08:39.480 --> 08:43.640]  their free will then would give them advanced knowledge but only for a price and so they
[08:43.640 --> 08:50.920]  are the children of their father do they imprinted on satan is not their spiritual father satan
[08:50.920 --> 08:56.000]  is not their historical father satan is not their genetic father they're made in the image
[08:56.000 --> 09:08.160]  of the creator but the fallen ones have imprinted on the transmission of death real weapons spiritual
[09:08.160 --> 09:17.720]  interdimensional weapons convince you to kill yourself our enemies aren't transported here
[09:17.720 --> 09:33.560]  in aluminum flying saucers and the bible tells us that and so now we've gone from stuff
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.720]  I was reading 30 years ago about global government depopulation that I would warn people about
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.680]  and show you the books and show you where they said it since then thousands of books
[09:44.680 --> 09:48.200]  have been written by them bragging about what they're going to do and their total control
[09:48.200 --> 09:55.360]  in their power but now they've gone from beta into operational so starting about 20 years
[09:55.360 --> 10:03.480]  ago you'd see one article a year about the depopulation plan of the earth in Wired Magazine
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.160]  cover story 1999 why the future doesn't need us telling you hey I went to a meeting with
[10:09.160 --> 10:14.240]  over 200 tech owners billionaires we had a consensus that we're just going to kill everybody
[10:14.240 --> 10:22.440]  but slowly incrementally so you never know what hit you your only chance is to be like
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.080]  Theodore Kaczynski and kill all of us and go back to an agrarian society or you're all
[10:27.080 --> 10:33.960]  dead I'm not saying that Bill Joy owner of Sun Microsystems said it you ask why would
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.840]  he tell you that well because he signed on to the plan but it's kind of like in the French
[10:39.840 --> 10:51.960]  art of fencing they say in French on guard on guard on guard guard yourself I'm about
[10:51.960 --> 10:58.760]  to kill your ass on guard and that's why they tell you so it was one article a year then
[10:58.760 --> 11:02.920]  ten a year then a hundred a year now 10,000 a week 10,000 a week just everywhere we're
[11:02.920 --> 11:06.960]  going to kill humans humans are scum yes any humans tell me so much fun oh my god it's
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.200]  so wonderful got a big stack up right here for you how they're going to kill you and
[11:10.200 --> 11:18.320]  your family and so you can sit here and ignore this project of post humanism or you can decide
[11:18.320 --> 11:21.900]  to do something about it and become aware of it and warn others because how it gets
[11:21.900 --> 11:25.600]  controlled through the medical tyranny and the world idea they're setting up now through
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.480]  the covid hysteria and once they've got that and the social credit score it's all over
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.760]  they'll be able with incremental credits to get the general public who no longer have
[11:35.760 --> 11:43.000]  jobs or industry and who no longer have any type of future to sell themselves for for
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.320]  chicken feed and then to be organized into armies against those of us that still want
[11:47.320 --> 11:53.480]  to remain human so here's john bound's latest report humans are quietly going extinct and
[11:53.480 --> 11:58.400]  we'll be back with the rest of the story here it is it isn't the liberal hostage situation
[11:58.400 --> 12:05.800]  of climate change look the climate crisis is not our fight alone is a global fight the
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.760]  report suggests we now have just 12 years to avoid damaging storms catastrophic drought
[12:11.760 --> 12:18.560]  wildfires and rising sea levels we now know that definitively at no point during the least
[12:18.560 --> 12:25.360]  the past 800,000 years has atmospheric co2 been as high as it is today the reason you
[12:25.360 --> 12:32.680]  chose 800,000 years ago is because for 200 million years before that was greater than
[12:32.680 --> 12:37.080]  than it is today and I'm going to start for the record yeah but there weren't human beings
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.840]  I mean there was a different world folks we didn't have seven billion people how to get
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.040]  to 2,000 parts per million if we humans weren't here because there were all kinds of geologic
[12:46.040 --> 12:51.840]  events happening on earth which spewed up geology stop when we got on the planet mr.
[12:51.840 --> 12:58.760]  chairman it isn't merely a new coronavirus or a nuclear war this overlooked research
[12:58.760 --> 13:05.720]  makes all of those issues meaningless an alarming new study has found that's between 1973 and
[13:05.720 --> 13:12.800]  2011 sperm counts in western males men in north america europe australia and new zealand
[13:12.800 --> 13:19.200]  dropped from an average of 99 million sperm per cubic centimeter to just 47 million you
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.120]  know what's not theoretically if the trend I'm going to play this whole video next segment
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.240]  because I looked at my sheet wrong and it's a longer report than I thought you know I've
[13:28.240 --> 13:32.120]  already watched it study to play the next segment but its humans are quietly going extinct
[13:32.120 --> 13:38.000]  because did you notice the countries because they did em all over the world where the sperm
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.720]  is all going away doesn't matter if you're black or white whether you're asian or hispanic
[13:41.720 --> 13:48.920]  if you live in australia if you live in europe if you live in canada or the u.s. your genitals
[13:48.920 --> 13:59.600]  are getting smaller your sperm counts going down and in utero at a key point if the testosterone
[13:59.600 --> 14:07.080]  is not developed in the baby you don't even develop male neuron development in the brain
[14:07.080 --> 14:13.400]  and you actually have more of a feminine brain because the imprint in a fetus is more female
[14:13.400 --> 14:20.600]  if you get into the genetics and then it expresses the male attributes early in development
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.080]  but that's what happens and that's why men you know have the equivalent of female breast
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.760]  which is on the breast tissue and so they do this with carp they put a chemical in with
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.760]  the carp eggs so the carp are all female or sterilized depending on which chemical they
[14:36.760 --> 14:43.200]  use just a couple drops in each little little pool it happens and then we have all the documents
[14:43.200 --> 14:51.800]  from the club of Rome and the cfr and ecoscience and the great reset where they admit they're
[14:51.800 --> 15:01.200]  doing it and along with it comes the cancer so the men aren't just feminine and sterile
[15:01.200 --> 15:09.480]  on a sliding scale downwards to total sterilization by 2047 current rates the men get all these
[15:09.480 --> 15:15.720]  horrible cancers other problems but women age faster than they used to and they go into
[15:15.720 --> 15:22.320]  puberty now some babies at birth just a few decades ago it was rare to have a girl at
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.760]  puberty at 10 now a lot of them go into it at 8 it's pretty normal and then now babies
[15:26.760 --> 15:37.160]  are having periods especially when their mommy takes the shot so you're an old woman by 30
[15:37.160 --> 15:41.320]  you're dead by 40 and you never have children and that's what Aldous Huxley said they would
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.000]  do in Brave New World later he said Brave New World is actually a real plan my brother
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.080]  came up with to kill you and your family his brother ran the UN haha that Aldous Huxley's
[15:50.080 --> 16:00.480]  brother Julian Huxley will be right back stay with us one of the most popular memes
[16:00.480 --> 16:05.200]  on the internet in the last decade has been Alan Jones was right but it now routinely
[16:05.200 --> 16:11.800]  trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook making the globalist pull their
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.360]  hair out in anger let me tell you we are tomorrow's news today and thanks for your support we're
[16:16.360 --> 16:20.600]  still on air at info wars dot com and band on video radio stations and TV stations across
[16:20.600 --> 16:24.920]  the country and our film in game censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number
[16:24.920 --> 16:29.920]  one a few years ago it's now available again we have reprinted it on high quality DVD in
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.360]  HD it has a zero country code anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it and
[16:34.360 --> 16:38.440]  I'm asking you to get the original make copies give it to everyone you know air local access
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.600]  TV give it to your pastors your police chiefs your state reps your prime ministers whatever
[16:42.600 --> 16:47.280]  you do warn the world this film uses their own documents and those statements 14 years
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.120]  ago to expose them it's more important than ever available at info war store dot com that's
[16:52.120 --> 16:59.160]  info war store dot com in game blueprint for global enslavement I'm not going to say this
[16:59.160 --> 17:03.200]  five times on the road of the obnoxious I'm saying it because it's the key to victory
[17:03.200 --> 17:11.440]  over these criminals last week the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's
[17:11.440 --> 17:17.520]  top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it have taken the so-called
[17:17.520 --> 17:23.480]  COVID-19 franken shot I'm going to say the second time around half of the doctors at
[17:23.480 --> 17:31.440]  the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots they don't trust it you shouldn't trust
[17:31.440 --> 17:36.400]  it the vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world this is an attack on the American
[17:36.400 --> 17:42.000]  people the people of the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again let me
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.240]  say it two more times around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC the medical staff
[17:48.240 --> 17:53.280]  refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors nurses do not trust a so-called
[17:53.280 --> 18:01.080]  vaccine and you you shouldn't either you should want everyone you know about the truth you're
[18:01.080 --> 18:31.040]  listening to the Alex Jones show the key to the globalist transhumanist take
[18:31.040 --> 18:40.880]  over plan is long-term incrementalism and mesmerizing the public into a scientific daydream it's
[18:40.880 --> 18:54.720]  scientifically induced form of deep conditioning the public at a near trans state highly suggestible
[18:54.720 --> 19:01.320]  but the base of it is incredible reflexive laziness where the attention span used to
[19:01.320 --> 19:07.280]  be over an hour long of the 1920s now it's less than a goldfish goldfish is like 12 and
[19:07.280 --> 19:13.240]  a half seconds depending on the species the average human is between 7 and 11 seconds
[19:13.240 --> 19:21.040]  and so we have been trained by the flashing screens and constant changing news and information
[19:21.040 --> 19:27.720]  to go into subconscious mode because only the subconscious can read something coming
[19:27.720 --> 19:33.080]  at you that fast but then the subconscious can be programmed and and they don't even
[19:33.080 --> 19:38.600]  deny this now it's all the news all the curves add subliminally program people and it doubled
[19:38.600 --> 19:46.680]  curse sales but once people and they have that the 50s and real quick flashes of a desert
[19:46.680 --> 19:52.800]  and you're dying of thirst your throat is parked you feel terrible you can't read that
[19:52.800 --> 20:01.280]  in a few frames in a millisecond just a tiny flash but you're subconscious saw that you're
[20:01.280 --> 20:07.560]  in a desert and you need something next though up there for 30 seconds is popcorn and a delicious
[20:07.560 --> 20:17.400]  Coca-Cola with condensation in a bucket of ice or I'm starving I'm hungry my stomach hurts
[20:17.400 --> 20:27.000]  I'm hungry delicious all be Frank's then they're on screen and you run out by a hot dog that's
[20:27.000 --> 20:32.880]  the friendliest way okay instead they got subliminals out there a pentagrams and dead
[20:32.880 --> 20:38.440]  babies and Satanism and it comes out that's there and and just children being murdered
[20:38.440 --> 20:43.640]  and just everything else but it's all cartoon style and it's done subliminally of course
[20:43.640 --> 20:49.480]  the FBI isn't authorized by the system to go after it because they're owned by the same
[20:49.480 --> 20:54.880]  system and I go on for hundreds of hours I mean it's just total and then there's overt
[20:54.880 --> 21:01.240]  conditioning that overt lying to you to gaslight you just to condition you to accept lies Tim
[21:01.240 --> 21:09.680]  Cook of Apple the most brutal corporation in the world it's estimated tells the Chinese
[21:09.680 --> 21:13.520]  communists that they won't even pay what the communists want people paid they're the biggest
[21:13.520 --> 21:23.400]  users of slave labor of the Wuhan the Uyghurs and others there's a Wall Street Journal article
[21:23.400 --> 21:28.200]  with quotes of him on the stand saying Apple doesn't want to make money we're not a monopoly
[21:28.200 --> 21:33.680]  that's preposterous I don't know how much money we make I don't you know we didn't take 30%
[21:33.680 --> 21:37.880]  of fortnight video games money because we wanted billions of dollars that's just preposterous
[21:37.880 --> 21:44.680]  I'm gonna read those quotes later why would he say that because it's a psychological tactic
[21:44.680 --> 21:48.880]  to lie to you all the time and insult your intelligence and then see him never get in
[21:48.880 --> 21:56.600]  trouble for it but see when your mind is dialed up and actually awake you see it all like
[21:56.600 --> 22:01.720]  we play you this report and show you the countries that have the fastest decline in sperm why
[22:01.720 --> 22:09.200]  is it Australia New Zealand the US Canada Europe because that well I mean where are they pushing
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.400]  the mRNA vaccines that reduce fertility and give you cancer and heart attacks they're
[22:13.400 --> 22:20.640]  banned in China they're banned in India they're pushing them on the West because that's where
[22:20.640 --> 22:24.200]  the globalist are in control that's where there was a history of freedom they want to
[22:24.200 --> 22:31.040]  get rid of that first conquer that first with race war and poison vaccines and all the rest
[22:31.040 --> 22:35.920]  of it and then once the Christian West isn't there to block the population they're gonna
[22:35.920 --> 22:41.960]  wipe out everybody else and that's the plan capture what's left of the real liberal West
[22:41.960 --> 22:46.120]  with their fake neoliberalism and once that's fallen it's all over so here's the report
[22:46.120 --> 22:49.840]  we'll come back to the tail all the latest news where the media is celebrating what
[22:49.840 --> 22:55.280]  you're about to see humans are quietly going extinct at man dot video please share it your
[22:55.280 --> 23:02.240]  future depends on it it isn't the liberal hostage situation of climate change look the
[23:02.240 --> 23:08.440]  climate crisis is not our fight alone is a global fight the report suggests we now have
[23:08.440 --> 23:15.360]  just 12 years to avoid damaging storms catastrophic drought wildfires and rising sea levels we
[23:15.360 --> 23:23.280]  now know that definitively at no point during the least the past 800,000 years has atmospheric
[23:23.280 --> 23:29.720]  CO2 been as high as it is today the reason you chose 800,000 years ago is because for
[23:29.720 --> 23:35.440]  200 million years before that was greater than that than it is today and I'm gonna
[23:35.440 --> 23:38.920]  spend it for the record yeah but there weren't human beings I mean there was a different
[23:38.920 --> 23:43.600]  world folks we didn't have seven billion people how to get to 2,000 parts per million if we
[23:43.600 --> 23:48.280]  humans weren't here because there were all kinds of geologic events happening on earth
[23:48.280 --> 23:54.920]  which spewed up the geology stop when we got on the planet Mr. Chairman it isn't merely
[23:54.920 --> 24:02.720]  a new coronavirus or a nuclear war this overlooked research makes all of those issues meaningless
[24:02.720 --> 24:09.800]  an alarming new study has found that between 1973 and 2011 sperm counts in western males
[24:09.800 --> 24:15.880]  men in North America Europe Australia and New Zealand dropped from an average of 99
[24:15.880 --> 24:22.760]  million sperm per cubic centimeter to just 47 million theoretically if the trend persists
[24:22.760 --> 24:29.400]  by 2050 our sperm may disappear entirely the end of human procreation is right around the
[24:29.400 --> 24:35.800]  bend with the target date of 2045 if human fertility continues its race to the bottom
[24:35.800 --> 24:44.280]  it's been a 59% decline in total sperm count over the 40 years of our study if the pregnant
[24:44.280 --> 24:54.400]  woman is exposed to phthalates in early pregnancy these phthalates can reduce fetal testosterone
[24:54.400 --> 25:00.800]  at a critical time for male genital sexual development number of children is declining
[25:00.800 --> 25:05.960]  everywhere and in fact the countries that start high at start with a high number of
[25:05.960 --> 25:13.440]  children are going down faster when we looked at the data restricting it to the past 30
[25:13.440 --> 25:21.720]  years 20 years 10 years you might hope that it would be flattening out but we didn't see
[25:21.720 --> 25:29.680]  any indication of that which is alarming because if it were to continue on its present course
[25:29.680 --> 25:35.920]  well that's a difficult thing to do of course but just mathematically if you extended the
[25:35.920 --> 25:44.280]  line it does hit zero in 2045 of course many would argue that stem cell research offers
[25:44.280 --> 25:51.080]  a way forward sounds a little nuts but you take this cell you put it in a dish you put
[25:51.080 --> 25:57.920]  the right chemicals around it and lo and behold you can trick it into making sperm cells so
[25:57.920 --> 26:03.600]  it's the future of reproduction in 2050 years you know darling let's make a baby rather than
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.400]  having sex it's hold on I'm just gonna take some stem cells reverse engineer them and
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.800]  try and select the sperm from there I think sex always will have a future but it may get
[26:11.800 --> 26:18.320]  disconnected from reproduction engineering a better baby is the future but a way forward
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.960]  for who stem cells are only available to the wealthy if they're available at all all other
[26:23.960 --> 26:29.440]  classes would eventually die off exactly as the authors of the Georgia Guidestones would
[26:29.440 --> 26:36.280]  have it all the planning all the beta testing is over and now the great reset is here it's
[26:36.280 --> 26:44.800]  a future and for 80 plus percent of us we're not in it maintain humanity under 500 million
[26:44.800 --> 26:51.640]  in perpetual balance with nature like we're pets like we're a dog or a cat we take care
[26:51.640 --> 26:57.640]  of or like we're a museum piece where they call the population when listeners call into

[30:28.200 --> 30:34.640]  the world id vaccine passports are this is everything it's why schools are still closed
[30:34.640 --> 30:38.720]  in many areas it's why people won't go to work or don't have jobs it's why tens of
[30:38.720 --> 30:46.920]  millions more people are starving to death and hyperinflation is looming right down
[30:46.920 --> 30:52.480]  the street not on the horizon is because this is our future on this planet with evil people

[30:58.400 --> 31:04.920]  just an excuse for them to play god and use us as medical experiments so they can test
[31:04.920 --> 31:15.800]  on us and again via that carnage they believe find immortality so i just played most of

[31:45.760 --> 31:51.000]  don't control your mind they're trying to get full control with the global medical id
[31:51.000 --> 31:55.880]  and the global medical chip that claus wab has now announced on international television
[31:55.880 --> 32:03.040]  and i told you the chip was next because they've written all these books saying it's the plan
[32:03.040 --> 32:08.800]  it was in children's publications this last week everybody found it posted all the internet
[32:08.800 --> 32:14.040]  suddenly in time magazine for kids and other textbooks that soon you'll be getting a patch

[34:03.600 --> 34:08.800]  wearing dresses everyone because he's a by a lot he is a girl because in the first trimester
[34:08.800 --> 34:14.360]  very early on the chemicals weren't there because they were blocked by chemicals unnaturally
[34:14.360 --> 34:19.080]  put there to make your son a girl and now they're telling you everybody's going to be
[34:19.080 --> 34:24.280]  girls now and they're going to go would you like to be a girl because they're already

[34:29.160 --> 34:35.040]  of chemical attack cool but they know the boys may find out later and get hormone therapy
[34:35.040 --> 34:40.280]  and become biological males again and so they go oh we got to cut the genitals off by seven
[34:40.280 --> 34:46.000]  because studies show they'll wake up and say no got to brutalize them early got to remove
[34:46.000 --> 34:51.920]  the testicles because they can be regenerated don't want that in the future targeted genetic
[34:51.920 --> 34:58.800]  attack and it's all in the town of documents sperm counts plummet in western men study
[34:58.800 --> 35:07.040]  finds genital size plummets in all races and as soon as the country industrializes suddenly

[35:15.400 --> 35:21.560]  biologically female in the brain development centers and they're still part male but but
[35:21.560 --> 35:27.640]  they are female now partly done and that's why everybody's got to learn your little
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.040]  boys or girls now because we sterilize their ass those are the ones that didn't get brain
[35:33.040 --> 35:36.920]  damaged by the chemical attack they want that for a while got tens of millions of those per
[35:36.920 --> 35:41.360]  country brain damage that you got to take care of a soft kill weapon but now we're just
[35:41.360 --> 35:50.120]  going right into the sterilization and Forbes tells you you're not the man your father was
[35:50.120 --> 35:55.120]  it doesn't matter if you take testosterone later that doesn't reverse it fully because
[35:55.120 --> 36:03.800]  it's in utero that the chemicals block it in those first few weeks when the male blueprint
[36:03.800 --> 36:09.360]  is growing in your body activated by the hormone you're not going to have it you're going to
[36:09.360 --> 36:15.840]  die just like an omega man when he's got the cure for him and he goes listen I got the
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.120]  cure they go we don't want the cure and throw a spear into it the same thing you go hey
[36:21.120 --> 36:26.920]  that was this was done to you I like it and I'm gonna make you become sterile too because
[36:26.920 --> 36:33.080]  misery loves company sorry I haven't gotten to look at all these every one of these articles
[36:33.080 --> 36:41.480]  I guess just as bad right here oh but I'm the bad guy that told us what's happening years
[36:41.480 --> 36:45.320]  ago so I had to be attacked and hit all the comedy shows live ago that crazy guy says there's
[36:45.320 --> 36:50.040]  chemicals in the water making your son gay well really just sterile and dying early a
[36:50.040 --> 36:56.440]  cancer and brain damage they just say hey we screwed you up you're not a man so hey you

[37:03.680 --> 37:11.200]  long slide looms for world population with sweeping ramifications the new york times
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.920]  just came out with us a few days ago and boy do they love it they go on and on how great
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.240]  it is for the earth and how well they'll be almost no humans by 2047 and everyone will
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.520]  be sterile and not to mention what's happened to the women see it's hard to get eggs and
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.280]  show them what's been done to their eggs but it's easy to get the sperm and do the test
[37:31.280 --> 37:37.800]  and it goes on like an avalanche of demographic forces like an avalanche the demographic forces
[37:37.800 --> 37:43.560]  pushing towards more deaths than births seems to be expanding and accelerating everywhere
[37:43.560 --> 37:47.840]  in the industrial world fertility rates are falling nearly everywhere else the global
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.960]  population will enter a sustained decline for the first time a planet with fewer people
[37:52.960 --> 37:58.280]  could ease pressure on resources slow the destructive impact of climate change and reduce household
[37:58.280 --> 38:05.480]  burdens for women yes to be alone will reduce that slavery of having that baby that you
[38:05.480 --> 38:13.320]  love so much that loves you yes you're gonna love it oh and it goes on remember they even
[38:13.320 --> 38:17.200]  tell you in this article wall street journal because they're honest here they just say
[38:17.200 --> 38:21.680]  we're gonna merge the machines humans are obsolete covid showed that you're locked up
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.160]  looking forward to the end of humanity here's another one cyborgs will replace humans and
[38:27.160 --> 38:31.800]  remake the world james love lock says he's a top eugenicist globalist he was on to say
[38:31.800 --> 38:41.000]  humans will vanish entirely from the earth somewhere around 2047 funny same number the
[38:41.000 --> 38:49.000]  novo scene of the new period love lock imagines cyborgs filling every heavily sharing niche
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.320]  of the planet oh not just for humans but everything will be deployed displaced by the new silicone
[38:54.320 --> 38:59.920]  life form that hates carbon so much it tells you carbon will be eradicated we are rewriting
[38:59.920 --> 39:05.200]  our planet which is like oh this is very loving and liberal humans are evil and mad all carbon
[39:05.200 --> 39:11.120]  mad we are silicon we are silicon we are silicon like a starker episode we are the morgue you
[39:11.120 --> 39:18.720]  will assimilate resistance futile cdc investigating reports of heart problems in young vaccine
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.080]  recipients oh really heart attacks at death we'll tell you about that how they're gonna
[39:23.080 --> 39:29.080]  whitewash it coming up but that's just part of one stack so i thought i would just because

[42:58.720 --> 43:03.760]  to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses the third world dies
[43:03.760 --> 43:08.040]  we have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when
[43:08.040 --> 43:13.320]  you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third
[43:13.320 --> 43:17.680]  world and really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all
[43:17.680 --> 43:21.920]  over the United States that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[43:21.920 --> 43:26.960]  that can barely get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down plus the keystone pipeline
[43:26.960 --> 43:31.760]  has been shut down along with other pipelines the left is now blowing up dams across the
[43:31.760 --> 43:37.200]  US we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well ladies and gentlemen prepare
[43:37.200 --> 43:41.520]  to be a total slave the third world is imposing as well the borders have been removed until
[43:41.520 --> 43:46.760]  you wake up this is a globalist chai-com takeover Gregory said you have no hope they're announcing
[43:46.760 --> 43:52.160]  that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you that
[43:52.160 --> 44:00.160]  you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family you're
[44:00.160 --> 44:23.360]  listening to the Alex Jones show defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[44:23.360 --> 44:34.000]  it's Alex Jones like you see seniors in high school now they don't look that old they all
[44:34.000 --> 44:40.120]  still look like little shrimps kind of so I was wondering that right I see this article
[44:40.120 --> 44:50.760]  I see this study on Google testosterone the testosterone has been decreasing by one percent
[44:50.760 --> 44:58.680]  in the past 20 years every year in the United States among men isn't that crazy it's because
[44:58.680 --> 45:02.720]  we aren't doing as much manual labor we live a sedentary lifestyle but the worst thing
[45:02.720 --> 45:09.320]  there are chemicals in our food and in the air that actually decrease testosterone people
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.960]  talking about old man strength it's real like old men are stronger than this new generation
[45:13.960 --> 45:22.760]  is this not scary nobody really talks about this so I thought I'd tell you guys Dr. Kerry
[45:22.760 --> 45:28.400]  mollus was awarded the Nobel Prize for his invention of the polymers chain reaction the
[45:28.400 --> 45:36.000]  PCR the PCR is a method of analysis and wasn't designed to test for a virus mollus explains
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.880]  why and with PCR if you do it well you can find almost anything in anybody it starts
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.400]  making you believe in the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained in everything
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.600]  else right I mean because if you can amplify one single molecule up to a to something that
[45:51.600 --> 45:58.600]  you can really measure which PCR can do then there's just very few molecules that you don't
[45:58.600 --> 46:02.080]  have at least one single one of them in your body okay so that could be thought of as a
[46:02.080 --> 46:07.800]  misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful the PCR test can potentially find anything
[46:07.800 --> 46:13.960]  you are looking for depending on how high you turn it up and this is exactly what has
[46:13.960 --> 46:20.480]  been done the official protocol given for the PCR testing of COVID-19 created a floodgate
[46:20.480 --> 46:27.680]  of false positives to skew the results they call it asymptomatic because it's a lie these
[46:27.680 --> 46:33.880]  people don't have symptoms because they don't have COVID-19 they do it today because they've
[46:33.880 --> 46:39.320]  done it in the past and always gotten away with it thirty years ago Anthony Fauci head
[46:39.320 --> 46:46.280]  of the NIH made a name for himself by pushing for higher doses of the deadly drug AZT and
[46:46.280 --> 46:52.800]  old cancer chemotherapy too dangerous for approval onto AIDS patients Kerry mollus
[46:52.800 --> 46:58.520]  was hired to measure HIV in people's blood samples with his PCR he was working under
[46:58.520 --> 47:04.360]  the premise that HIV was the probable cause of AIDS but when he went looking for the proof
[47:04.360 --> 47:10.320]  he found there was none they just made it up what is that paper who do I go to for that
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.520]  and I looked around I asked a couple of our all just that company and they said no you
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.840]  don't have to reference I said I have to reference that because I don't know I don't know where
[47:18.840 --> 47:23.920]  that came from how do I know that and it turned out that nobody knew it and I was getting
[47:23.920 --> 47:29.840]  really freaked about that that's when I first started saying they don't know nobody really
[47:29.840 --> 47:36.400]  knows this whole thing is a big sham mollus pointed out how the CDC was losing money
[47:36.400 --> 47:42.440]  and how the HIV AIDS connection brought their profits back in the black and how the men
[47:42.440 --> 47:48.240]  at the highest levels were all in on it Kerry mollus knew these men were dangerous they
[47:48.240 --> 47:53.160]  don't want people like me walking up and asking them those kind of questions and they're willing
[47:53.160 --> 48:00.200]  to like go to great lengths to prevent that they're out on a limb I wouldn't want to be
[48:00.200 --> 48:05.960]  there with them but he was still outspoken when ABC's nightline approached him about
[48:05.960 --> 48:12.360]  doing a documentary on his work mollus convinced them to cover the HIV debate after nearly
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.880]  a decade of ignoring it in a 1994 interview with Celia Farber for spin magazine Kerry
[48:18.880 --> 48:24.480]  mollus expressed how he really wanted to expose Anthony Fauci and Robert Gallo he said that
[48:24.480 --> 48:30.680]  he'd be willing to chase the little bastard from his car to his office a Nobel Prize winner
[48:30.680 --> 48:37.840]  trying to ask a simple question from those who spent $22 billion and killed 100,000 people
[48:37.840 --> 48:44.720]  it has to be on TV I'm not unwilling to do something like that unfortunately not many
[48:44.720 --> 48:51.280]  people were listening back then and on August 7th 2019 just about three months before the
[48:51.280 --> 48:59.360]  first utterance of COVID-19 Kerry mollus age 74 a Nobel Prize winner inventor of the
[48:59.360 --> 49:08.240]  PCR test a man who was once willing and eager to expose Anthony Fauci quietly died of pneumonia
[49:08.240 --> 49:17.840]  the timing of it all is mysterious to many of us
[49:17.840 --> 49:22.240]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us we've been having some
[49:22.240 --> 49:25.520]  technical difficulties here and there your it has come out we're breaking no music not
[49:25.520 --> 49:29.280]  that big a deal except it's happening more and more I apologize for radio affiliates
[49:29.280 --> 49:33.360]  out there we're putting in a new computer system it's more updated more modern costs
[49:33.360 --> 49:38.720]  it's $300,000 that's what bigger networks use and I may have to just abandon that system and go
[49:38.720 --> 49:43.440]  back to the old one because since we did this it's having major problems so I apologize for
[49:43.440 --> 49:47.200]  that happening we've had to have more in the last month than it happened the last five years
[49:47.200 --> 49:50.960]  before that we're going to get to the bottom of one way or another because it also just breaks
[49:50.960 --> 49:55.440]  the whole you know system of the show we got us we got to air a special report all that happens
[49:55.440 --> 50:02.720]  but boy was that not a powerful special report at the same time right after Biden stole the
[50:02.720 --> 50:09.360]  election and got in they went from 40 cycles on the PCR test to 28 or 29 uh and now they're
[50:09.360 --> 50:13.760]  announcing oh if you haven't been vaccinated we're going to run at 40 cycles so you're false
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.920]  positive because you have been vaccinated we're going to run at 28 cycles which almost no one
[50:17.920 --> 50:24.800]  will be positive even if you are it's all how they label things and that's officially been announced
[50:24.800 --> 50:33.520]  that has officially been announced ladies and gentlemen that it's all a fraud big articles
[50:33.520 --> 50:41.600]  were out on info wars.com this weekend with direct links to the cdc explaining when you come in and
[50:41.600 --> 50:48.320]  you're sick they ask have you had the vaccine and if you say yes they run the PCR 28 times 28 cycles
[50:48.320 --> 50:56.320]  and if you say no they run at 40 so they can say the vaccine works and then say you're bad and
[50:56.320 --> 51:03.840]  have COVID even though at 40 times most of it's a false positive I mean a five-year-old could
[51:03.840 --> 51:12.960]  figure that level of a scam out I spent an hour on that basically last night on the Sunday show
[51:12.960 --> 51:17.680]  four to six p.m. I'm not going to do it again here today but I was tempted to air that special
[51:17.680 --> 51:23.840]  report again it was so powerful I suggest you fight back I suggest you go to Band-Aid video
[51:23.840 --> 51:29.600]  click on the left hand side navigation bar pull up Gregory's section and get that report and share it
[51:31.360 --> 51:39.040]  the mysterious death of dr. Fauci's most notable critic 932 000 views and boy are they pissed they
[51:39.040 --> 51:46.320]  are working around the clock to shut us down I know for the fact that mainstream corporate media
[51:46.320 --> 51:55.120]  is working illegally with the FBI and with other groups with stingray systems those are systems
[51:55.120 --> 52:00.240]  where you can pull up five miles from somebody and just dial into their phone number and then
[52:00.240 --> 52:05.280]  grab all their cell phone conversations and we're not doing anything illegal but they use it to
[52:05.280 --> 52:11.600]  harass and run off my crew members and so they call up they go oh we know about your medical

[54:55.440 --> 55:00.880]  how do i warn them well the problem is there's so many problems with it so many facts it's the
[55:00.880 --> 55:06.000]  history of contaminative vaccines the fact that they have liability protection in the us and europe
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.800]  the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things the vaccines
[55:10.800 --> 55:16.400]  and the whole history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[55:16.400 --> 55:21.840]  native americans the list goes on and on but what about the fact that fouchy testified to congress
[55:21.840 --> 55:30.880]  and so did the head of the cdc in late may of 2021 that around half of the nih cdc staff medical
[55:30.880 --> 55:35.120]  doctorsrologist scientists have refused to take the vaccine and don't think it's safe yeah i think
[55:35.120 --> 55:39.440]  what half of the doctors are scared to take it that's the same thing in the private practice
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.360]  is out there somewhere numbers that that's not something i'm gonna be taking that's very very

[58:07.120 --> 58:12.080]  people ask why did none of them have children because it's a damn post human cult and you
[58:12.080 --> 58:18.400]  don't get in it if you have children at least in this next phase because they're the minion class
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.760]  bill gates has a bunch of kids ted turner has a bunch and again they'll go oh you're knocking
[58:23.760 --> 58:28.080]  people don't have children no i'm no obviously you're not in that group you don't have children
[58:28.080 --> 58:35.120]  i'm saying they hate humanity they don't want a future they don't want to have a child and just
[58:35.120 --> 58:40.160]  transfer power to them they're gonna live forever they don't want children you see you can't have
[58:40.160 --> 58:45.200]  people living forever and then have new people being born because it overpopulates the universe
[58:47.440 --> 58:51.920]  there's got to be special boards and commissions in the galacticus system
[58:51.920 --> 58:57.120]  that decide who's allowed to procreate and you know as i say that you go you know i've heard that a
[58:57.120 --> 59:02.560]  lot even a new listener go where have i heard that in most of the marble comic movies
[59:04.720 --> 59:11.200]  in films going back a hundred years things to come hey she wells you'll see movies about oh i
[59:11.200 --> 59:17.840]  hope we get our license to have one child china already had that for 30 something years
[59:17.840 --> 59:26.960]  it's all a globalist plan and it'd be like trying to go through a cave without a light
[59:27.760 --> 59:35.840]  to not know this everything else hinges on the global takeover so they get full power to
[59:35.840 --> 59:41.840]  force the destruction of the grassroots economy to force control over you and your family to then
[59:41.840 --> 59:48.720]  inject you with soft kill weapons that take a week a month five years ten years to kill you
[59:48.720 --> 59:54.560]  depending on the person and they have plausible deniability and then we just get used to it yeah
[59:54.560 --> 59:58.960]  there's a lot of you go to the child movie now and like there's two or three rows of autistic kids
[59:58.960 --> 1:00:03.600]  in there god it seems like a third the kids can't talk and are screaming and yelling and swalking
[1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:07.840]  waving their hands around because there's cerebral cortex got annihilated
[1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:14.640]  it or a man i tell you there's a lot of kids on chemo man there are a lot of kids yeah none of
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:20.880]  that ever happened before because they're killing everybody and everybody just gets used to it
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:25.280]  having all these kids dying around us and having all these mentally retarded children all these
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:33.040]  autistic children and how do you make sure an autistic child you want to fried your brain
[1:00:33.040 --> 1:00:38.080]  but you didn't get those testicles didn't get those ovaries so now you give them the shot to make
[1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:44.480]  sure and yeah i'll give them a heart attack give them a lung bleed so what good medical system will
[1:00:44.480 --> 1:00:52.480]  suck your family dry get that money too because the globalists are predatorial there are predators
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:57.280]  and if you don't understand that and if you don't get that to your head you don't have any future
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:03.840]  so here's the deal i'm not a candy ass and i'm not going to sit up here and just blow bs at you
[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:08.720]  and i know you know that and i can play all these entertaining clips and make fun of liberals all day
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:15.280]  and you know talk about al qaeda and the muslims which is another army of the globalists but just
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:22.640]  know this it's all about chaos and the destruction of an upwardly mobile civilization with nuclear
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:29.200]  families and a goal and communing with god and the plans god asked for us but
[1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:34.960]  i mean i could get into trump rally's coming up how exciting that is or i could
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:40.800]  get into all the latest bitcoin news or i could tell you about uh hyperinflation coming up but
[1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:47.440]  instead i'm going to give you the latest on the covid 19 new world order takeover so we can stop
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:52.080]  it together which there's major pushback happening and some very positive things happening in the
[1:01:52.080 --> 1:02:02.160]  in the midst of all this chaos your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:07.840]  or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:13.440]  angry and now to get around big tech it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've

[1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:12.560]  all right we're in hour number two nick pointe as he's going to be debating robert barnes tomorrow
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:18.560]  night at sixth central on the israeli palestinian ongoing conflict it's going to be popping in
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:26.480]  next segment talk about that incredible racist pig on admiral octvars daughter i guess
[1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:33.360]  light foot up in chicago saying she won't talk to white people because they're inherently bad
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:37.520]  he's going to pop in and then i'm going to open the phones up and take your calls for the balance
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:44.560]  of the transmission today on a host of topics that all announce and if i get a little negative
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:48.640]  and bummed out about the new york times the washington post the wall street journal all
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:54.400]  celebrating sperm counts plunging toward zero soon the end of humanity how great it's going to be
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:59.840]  how wonderful it'll be for women not to have any children they actually say that how empowering
[1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:07.040]  it'll be the whole thing's asinine if you don't want to have children don't have them don't have
[1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.440]  them put chemicals in the food and water that cause this and then have them admit it all
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:17.040]  the phallates and the bisphenols and the atrazines and
[1:05:17.040 --> 1:05:26.720]  then it's all a big joke should i play you jimmy kimmel and cobear and all of them who had
[1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:30.800]  talking points over the years they go jones is that crazy guys saying there's chemicals in the
[1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:37.520]  food and water that are turning the frogs gay when they would ignore my whole report showing
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:42.240]  government documents but that's when it was internal information now it's out in the open
[1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:51.360]  but they don't tell you how to get away from it if you want potato chips buy potatoes slice them
[1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:59.360]  and fry them yourself if you literally stop eating off plastic if you stop microwaving things in
[1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:04.480]  plastic that's when the phallates really come out especially when your wife is pregnant
[1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:10.080]  you know getting pregnant it's a big deal you ought to go out to the countryside
[1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:15.200]  live off an organic garden and at least the first trimester or you're gonna get a mutant
[1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:21.360]  that's why the public looks so weak looks so sick they're screwed up because they're killing everybody
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:29.040]  and and that's all admitted so so again this isn't negative what i'm telling you there's still time
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:34.240]  why have you stuck your hand in a garbage disposal and turned it on and it was just
[1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:38.240]  cutting the ends of your fingers off there's still time to turn it off pull your hand out
[1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:44.240]  come up being negative i'm saying hey let's pull our hand back but old david rockefeller's project
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:49.040]  for bill gateson no no no that feels good what you're feeling that's a tickle
[1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:51.760]  shove that hand in with all the force you've got
[1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:58.560]  that climb up in that there wood chipper and you're gonna find all your dreams down at the bottom of
[1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:10.480]  it and it's all about seeing what you can do seeing what you'll go along with let's hit some
[1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:15.760]  more headlines here cdc investigating reports of heart problems in young vaccine recipients
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:20.880]  and of course it's always the same article oh there was a few people might have had a problem
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:25.600]  well they don't mention the people dying 15-year-old boy dies of heart attack two days after taking
[1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:33.680]  Pfizer vaccine had no history of allergic reactions that's in the VAERS ID system 1242573
[1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:41.360]  and all these countries have banned these vaccines but again mainstream news and the late
[1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:48.640]  night comics all laugh at us and say just take it everything's fine here's a little clip off of local
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:57.520]  nbc talking about what's happening with the reports of heart problems in the young here it is
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:02.320]  there are reports that heart problems are now coming up with some young people who take the
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:07.280]  covid-19 vaccine the cdc is certainly investigating wanting to know what's happening here it
[1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:12.960]  resides at nico cleman spoke with a doctor about these recent findings it's a scary thing because
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:18.720]  we are really protective of our heart tonight new concerns surrounding the covid-19 vaccine and
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:23.760]  young people the cdc says it's investigating reported cases of heart problems in teens
[1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:28.720]  and young adults who've received the vaccine a may 17th report from the agency's vaccine safety
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:33.840]  groups said some developed myocarditis and inflammation of the heart muscle dr john green
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:39.200]  is the chief of infectious diseases at the moffitt cancer center they want the information out now
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:46.880]  so they can get all the reports and then really come up with a recommendation is is a truly an
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:52.960]  increased risk or is this just a random finding the vaccine safety group said most cases appear to
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:58.880]  be mild and follow-up of cases is ongoing earlier this month the cdc committee endorsed the fizer
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:04.080]  vaccine for kids as young as 12 while the moderna vaccine is still recommended for people 18 and
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:10.960]  older according to the cdc it'll probably turn out that this myocarditis is no more likely than
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:17.760]  deafness that was just recently investigated but you know that's why we want to know now and then
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:23.120]  we can come up with a figure despite the recent news dr green is telling parents get your children
[1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:30.720]  vaccinated the risk of getting those bad outcomes with the vaccine is a hundred times less than
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:37.200]  getting the viral infection and because of that we're still recommending people it's in your best
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:42.560]  interest to get the vaccine he says the more who do the more we can get this pandemic under
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:50.640]  control and can't go clements eight on your side get the pandemic under control 15 days to cut the
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:55.920]  curve all that other bs it's all fake numbers it's not even killed the deaths even happening
[1:09:55.920 --> 1:10:02.480]  in places like london but they're still locked down oh there's one case in new zealom they shut
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:06.960]  the whole country down it's about martial law notice he just said we have a study that we
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:11.360]  don't know to the experimental shot but it's a hundred times more dangerous to get coveted
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.800]  than to get this vaccine that's been banned in india and china because of heart attacks
[1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:24.960]  and hey if you're 15 and you get it your heart starts beating crazy it swells up you got chest
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:29.680]  pain well you you're probably gonna live but you're 65 70 you already got some blockages
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.160]  you're gonna be like marvellous marvin haggler you're gonna be like so many others that died of
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:41.920]  heart attack right after they took it and then the media lies and says oh there was an autopsy
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:46.640]  done on mdx and there was an autopsy done on marvellous marvin there was an autopsy done on
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:55.920]  hank erin so they turned out they're one they just took the shot and had a heart attack the
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:00.320]  next day it was usually the second shot in fact all three of died on the second shot
[1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:05.680]  and you've got the discoverer of hiv saying don't take it it can cause you to have a heart attack
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:14.000]  and die but don't listen to nobel prize winner listen to the cdc that makes money off the shots
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.200]  owns part of the patents and listen to the very doctors giving you the shots so they've
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:22.160]  bought into the kool-aid man they've gone along with the whole plan
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:29.280]  bombshell nobel prize winner reveals COVID vaccine is creating variants
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:31.200]  and he goes on to say causing ade
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.280]  and other serious problem but don't listen to them oh ship pulls guidance stating employers
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.920]  maybe he'll liable for adverse reactions if they mandate the vaccine goes on to
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:49.520]  say it's an unapproved emergency authorized vaccine that says right here if there may be
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.800]  adverse reactions that'll be counted as a workplace uh claim but now because that was
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.480]  making some of them not take the shot well they removed it off there oh the censorship is quite
[1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:08.800]  powerful isn't that just interesting here's another one doctors message about how pediatric
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:13.760]  deaths from COVID blocked on facebook a prestigious doctor testified to the legislature in their
[1:12:13.760 --> 1:12:18.960]  state about how children don't die of COVID but the vaccine can cause the major health problems
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:22.320]  and if they've already had COVID they shouldn't take the vaccine well Facebook says that's not
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:30.320]  allowed that's just the tip of the iceberg but we're gonna have nick point as pop in with us
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:40.400]  to talk about the incredible racism of the chicago mayor lightfoot admiral act bars doctor daughter
[1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:45.440]  i'm told so that is coming up on the other side and by the way nick point has it's going to be
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:52.000]  debating robert barnes on the israeli palestinian ongoing conflict tomorrow night 6 p.m central
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.080]  and info wars you know it's crazy to get to this point it's very better sweet everything we've
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:01.840]  everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:05.920]  credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order and it's because
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:10.880]  we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much longer and i don't have time
[1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:14.880]  to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons i can't tell you what's going on
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:18.960]  but let's just say this we're going to see this through the end we're going to stay on air as
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:24.400]  long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the products and then for store.com they're
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:29.120]  great products plus they fund the operation so you know unlike other products you can buy they're
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:34.160]  still great do they fund freedom no a lot of them don't these are great products that fund freedom
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:39.280]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists
[1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:43.520]  are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:47.600]  so while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word download everything
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:51.520]  we've done you can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:56.560]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said i'm not going to say this five times on
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:00.640]  the road to the obnoxious i'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:09.920]  last week the arch globalist foushee admitted that roughly half of the cdc's top brass and workers
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:15.920]  medical doctors scientists nurses you name it have taken the so-called covid-19 frankenshot

[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:42.000]  is an absolute red flag smoking gun again let me say it two more times around half the individuals
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.960]  that work at the ny asian cdc the medical staff have refused to take the vaccines that's right the
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:52.560]  doctors nurses scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine and you you shouldn't either use for
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:15:18.160]  everyone you know about the truth you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.160]  nick i know this is old news that happened a few weeks ago but i saw your commentary
[1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:37.840]  on some of the new developments uh your your mayor not only says i can get haircut you can't
[1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:45.360]  literally said that not only is is is is her wife a white woman so she likes a little cream
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:50.400]  in her coffee uh but she will not talk to white reporters saying they're inherently bad i mean
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:56.240]  this is beyond kkk stuff last time i heard even the kkk will talk to black reporters this is real
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:17:00.480]  race peddling and we know she doesn't do her own thinking we know she's a minion of the dnc
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:05.120]  what in the hell is going on what's it like to be a white person living in chicago and the
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:11.600]  mayor says that uh she won't even talk to white people well it's terrible alex this was a once
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:17.520]  great city in chicago which i know it's hard to believe everybody knows chicago i think in america
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:22.640]  is one of the most violent cities in the world and poor and now led by mary lory lightfoot who is
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:27.440]  really like a bonehead and if you see her she's always wearing these costumes and now she's saying
[1:17:27.440 --> 1:17:32.880]  this kind of racist stuff and it's really a tragedy what's happened to chicago it's kind of a vision
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:38.480]  of the future of america in many ways not only with the governance but how the entire city is set up
[1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:44.960]  and people should really go back and look at what detroit or chicago or la or new york city
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:51.680]  looked like 60 70 a hundred years ago and look at what they look like today and that is basically
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:56.240]  what's going to happen to the entire united states of america because you see the same trends
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:01.920]  the same policies the same demographic trends and other trends happening elsewhere in america
[1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:05.680]  that have destroyed all these cities and in particular with mayor lory lightfoot
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:10.640]  like you said she's been a disaster with the covid lockdown total hypocrite she tells you
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:15.040]  can't get a haircut she goes out and gets one she says you can't wear a mask i think she was seen
[1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:20.080]  last week at a party with no mask on herself and she's not the only one it's gretchen wittmer
[1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:24.160]  it's gabin do some i think it's almost every single one of them who says you have to wear a mask they
[1:18:24.160 --> 1:18:29.360]  at some point or another are caught not wearing one but this came last tuesday she said that she'll
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:34.320]  no longer speak to white journalists or white reporters because she says there's a deficit
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:41.440]  it there's not enough but she's married because she's married to a white woman so so again she
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:47.040]  has sex with a white woman it won't talk to other white people that's right yeah well she'll only
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:52.080]  talk to white people i guess after work maybe uh pillow talk or whatever something like that
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:56.880]  and not to get gross i don't even like to imagine what's going on over there but that's right yeah
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:02.400]  she won't talk to journalists who are white on the job but she has a white white well you see this
[1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:07.040]  all the time actually a lot of times i'm not the first person to say this but a lot of times you'll
[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:13.120]  see there's a lot of blm militant black activists and they all have white boyfriends particularly
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:17.280]  the black women i don't know what that's all about but with lori lightfoot she said this last
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:22.000]  tuesday and it's amazing and i know conservatives have pointed this out and they always do that if
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.160]  the shoe were on the other foot obviously this would not be acceptable i mean just imagine for
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:32.560]  one second if donald trump or a ronda sanchez or tucker carlson said i won't speak to a non-white
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:37.200]  journalist i will not speak to a non-white reporter everybody knows what would happen
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:42.800]  and you know what this is really part of is institutional anti-white racism which people
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:47.680]  don't want to call out but that's what this is a part of and and people talk about institutional
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:53.440]  racism a lot over the past year because of the george floyd killing and the blm situation last
[1:19:53.440 --> 1:19:58.640]  year but if you really parse it out you look at government officials and what they say at official
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:04.160]  government policies the only people that are on the receiving end of so-called institutional racism
[1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:08.960]  are white people that's not to say that there's not prejudice or bigotry that goes on every day
[1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:14.160]  between all different kinds of people that's the nature of people but as far as the institutions go
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:19.520]  we take a look at something like affirmative action i mean that's the definition of institutional
[1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:24.400]  racism when they set a racial quota and they say that in so far as you are black if you are less
[1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:30.400]  qualified you'll get into the university and if you're white and more qualified asian too uh you
[1:20:30.400 --> 1:20:36.000]  do not get into the university and then the same goes for the distribution of the covid aid money
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:42.080]  i had a friend of mine recently who called up his bank and he wanted to get the ppp loan he's a
[1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:47.840]  self-employed person he wanted to get the paycheck protection program money through the small business
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:53.520]  association he called up his bank and the bank told him that he couldn't get the money because he
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:21:00.000]  was white and for now the sba is prioritizing their ppp money and there are other forms of
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:05.040]  covid relief for non-white business owners and let's be clear that's all over the news it's
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:09.200]  a hundred percent racist but it's being done to get control of these groups they're not doing it
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:13.280]  because they love these groups they're doing it where they destroy the economy they make you come
[1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:19.760]  hat in hand to get the money but with political strings attached that's right well and destroying
[1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:24.320]  it's really ultimately about destroying the middle class i mean that's ultimately what a
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:28.000]  lot of this is about when they're introducing section eight when they're denying the aid when
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.760]  they're putting everybody ultimately i think on ubi by destroying people's wages raising the cost of
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:39.440]  living inflation like you said they want people coming to the government hat in hand and totally
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:43.760]  dependent on them and and the vaccine passport is a big part of this too i mean they're creating
[1:21:43.760 --> 1:21:49.040]  this infrastructure where unless you abide by the government's mandates first it's the vaccine you
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:54.640]  get the vaccine eventually it could be something else maybe it's you're not you know sufficiently
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:59.040]  anti-racist you're not sufficiently well in the uk the government's openly saying if we say you're
[1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:03.200]  racist which is just being nationalist you're going to be denied health care that's where this
[1:22:03.200 --> 1:22:07.680]  goes you have a socialist system with mega corporations offshore their tax exempt and the
[1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:12.880]  socialist system for the general public decides your behavior is in how you're treated basically
[1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:19.120]  the whole world's a giant prison exactly exactly right and in the same way that in the prison the
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:23.600]  prisoners are dependent on the prison guards and the prison wardens bringing them their food and
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:28.160]  letting them go outside and everything like that they're creating that in the entire world on the
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:33.680]  entire planet earth where unless you abide by the government's edicts or mandates they will shut
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:37.760]  down your life and when you don't own anything and when you don't have anything that you could really
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:41.920]  say is your own like what's happening right now government setting up checkpoints in front of
[1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:47.360]  every grocery store restaurant you know baseball game or whatever that's ultimately the consequences
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:52.560]  complete and total control over your life if you don't abide by what they say that i mean i don't
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:56.320]  just agree that's what's happening it's a fact no one can deny it what about this i'm not a
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:00.800]  litigious person but on average uh at least in the past white people or conservatives whatever you
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:05.360]  want to aren't as litigious christians aren't as litigious well it's not litigious if i go to
[1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:10.800]  a bank to get a loan that the bank's been given money to help small businesses and i'm white
[1:23:10.800 --> 1:23:15.680]  and then they say sorry you're white that's bs nothing with black people it's an institution
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:21.520]  discriminating against me they need to be sued out of business that is outrageous absolutely
[1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:25.920]  absolutely agree and with white people it seems like we're a demographic which kind of just gets
[1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:29.840]  like kicked around if this happened to any other group and we know who that is it would either be
[1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:37.280]  riots in the street or to be adl aclu coming down hard so that's where we as conservatives as
[1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:41.520]  as patriots we have to begin to organize for italian against this kind of stuff with litigation
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:46.240]  like you said because this is illegal it should be illegal this is america we still have five more
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:50.080]  ministers on the side i want to ask you a few other political questions about the democrats

[1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:16.560]  which is just an index of the same site but it got too popular so they banned that a few days ago
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:23.840]  so we created a new url so you can be activist and share it we'll put that on screen and that is
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:30.640]  of course freeworldnews.tv what a great name freeworldnews.tv i'm intending to even launch
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:35.040]  a new podcast and a show called that just so you know i'd be a month i'd be six months from now but
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:39.680]  it's happening another studio whole nine yards we're just expanding in the face of the tyranny
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:45.040]  freeworldnews.tv you heard it here first all right nick i want to talk some about the debate
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:49.760]  coming up tomorrow night i'm trying to get barnes on tomorrow before the debate to give his views
[1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:55.440]  as a prelude but but shifting gears uh just back to the big picture i had you on about
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:00.800]  lightfoot an incredible example of double standards i saw your own piece that was excellent that's
[1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:07.520]  at band.video a clip from your live show you do weeknights where you simply stated the fact that
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:13.680]  notice the article said is it wrong she said i won't talk to white people it's like saying is it wrong
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:18.080]  that someone molested a child they always is it wrong that they're doing the knockout game
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:22.720]  knocking white people out this is how the left does it i wanted you to finish up speaking on that
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:27.360]  and then big picture what else is on your radar what you think's most important right now
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:33.360]  sure well yeah to finish up on lori lightfoot what was amazing is even in the covers that i read
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:38.960]  i think in the new york post new york post is a seemingly right-leaning publication they talked
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:43.040]  about how lori lightfoot said well she won't talk to white journalists because she thinks
[1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:48.960]  that there's not enough non-white journalists and new york post said well actually there's two
[1:29:48.960 --> 1:29:54.960]  non-white journalists from one station alone and i'm thinking uh this is that really kind of besides
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:59.920]  the point it doesn't really matter why she's doing it if she's discriminating based on race if she's
[1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:03.840]  hating against white people it doesn't really matter that like well technically her reasoning
[1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:08.800]  isn't totally correct and conservatives are gonna break free from that mentality people got to call
[1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:13.120]  it what it is which is anti-white i'm i'm actually very pleased to see a lot of people are beginning
[1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:17.760]  to say that because that's what it is people try to obfuscate into many different ways and i call it
[1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:22.400]  different things which are real you know things like cultural Marxism critical race theory is real
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:27.360]  but it's important that we explicitly say it's anti-white because you're going to see more and
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:32.480]  more of it and these are the kinds of people that are they're acceding up through the different
[1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:37.760]  ranks and power it's lori lightfoot's the mayor of chicago stacey aims she could be the governor of
[1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:42.560]  georgia and kamala harris could be the president of the united states one day and i mean make no
[1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:46.720]  mistake about it that people are anti-white but so so that's lori light but i think that kind of
[1:30:46.720 --> 1:30:49.760]  ties it up let me just add one more point and then get to the next point because you're absolutely
[1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:56.000]  right but notice all these universities in europe in australia in the uk here canada it's globally
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:59.680]  done by the corporations and governments it's not like these universities just come up with this by
[1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:05.440]  themselves and it's it's you know one university does this one does that it's all unified now down to
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:10.720]  just uh you know elementary schools and and and and right on up to trade schools it's the same
[1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:15.600]  corporate propaganda it's marxist the head of space force came out and said that a week ago
[1:31:15.600 --> 1:31:20.880]  he got fired over it for saying we have marxist infiltration black lives matter is marxist it's
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:27.680]  the founders say it's marxist it's in their code of of battle plan it's in their platform but
[1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:33.600]  pulling back all these different colleges are like no whites are allowed this weekend you started
[1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:40.640]  in canvass and then moved to uh a washington state uh universities and then the uk has it and then
[1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:47.520]  oh rock climbing only for black students because you know whites are bad just it's outrageous to
[1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:52.080]  introduce that idea that's not about giving special perks to black people it's about the
[1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:57.360]  government having the power to say who's essential and who isn't and to pick favorites which is the
[1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:03.600]  essential ingredient of an authoritarian system right well and they're attacking this sort of
[1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:09.440]  foundational stock of america this is an assault on the united states of america on europe it's
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:13.760]  happening through mass migration and like you said it's happening with this sort of public-private
[1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:19.360]  partnership between the world's giant corporations and the governments of the world and their
[1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:24.640]  central banks and as we happen to be in the united states of america this sort of constitutes and
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:30.560]  manifests itself as an attack on the stock of the country on the majority stock the middle class the
[1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:35.040]  sort of interior of the country i think what's very important to note is that if you look at
[1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:40.480]  donald trump's voter base it was people from so-called flyover country largely white people
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:46.480]  that put him into power and he was the challenge against the global power structure and so when
[1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:51.920]  they strike at white america when they strike at white people they're striking at the base of the
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:57.520]  people that mounted this challenge to their power in 2016 and it's very important to know that that
[1:32:57.520 --> 1:33:02.320]  like that's where it's going to come from when they take over when they do full covid you know
[1:33:02.320 --> 1:33:07.840]  project blue beam whatever when they go full bore you know bill gates technocratic dictatorship
[1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:12.880]  globally it is going to be the base of people that put donald trump in a power 2016 that will
[1:33:12.880 --> 1:33:18.560]  resist that that's right they know it's been christians that challenged autocratic control uh
[1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:23.040]  the christians have done some bad too but over time and they know it's been on the american system
[1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:28.080]  that defeated the the king of england and so they're they're they know there's traditionalist
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:33.040]  who will challenge the new world order and so that's why they're going after the only opposition
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:38.080]  really left on the planet uh is christian americans and the globalists are trying to make it racial
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:43.120]  so people of color don't adopt the american ethos don't adopt the birthright because they're
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:48.320]  now americans uh and and hopefully then can be used against america in some type of a bizarre
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:53.760]  social envy but i don't see that working we saw record numbers vote for trump who weren't white
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:59.520]  but the globalists have stole the election anyways that's right well in 2020 obviously
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:04.080]  donald trump won the election he won every one of those six swing states where there was election
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:09.040]  battling where there was mail and ballot fraud and and you're right to an extent that in in 2020
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:13.840]  trump got way more votes from hispanics he got slightly more with blacks and i think more with
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:18.480]  jewish people as well ultimately what it comes down to is that the people that are pouring across
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.680]  the border right now they are not in a position to defend themselves against globalism they are
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.920]  distinctly where and they're they're shrewd the people that are in power they know that when you
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:32.560]  look at these kinds of communities whether they bring in a permanent underclass they control
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:37.920]  exactly exactly right these are people that they don't have the wherewithal they don't have the
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:44.160]  finances they don't own anything these are not people that are any kind of barrier to total
[1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:49.200]  control from the government they're coming out of a surf state into a new surf state in closing
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:53.120]  because you cover a lot of intriguing stuff and i watch your show we now are blessed to have you
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:58.240]  posting and after it's live at band.video nick point is his own page uncensored he uploads right
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:04.640]  to it with his crew it's just amazing videos i watch them all the time at band.video you talk
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.200]  about bluebeam you talk about the hyping of the ufo's i totally agree with your take on that
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:16.000]  yes yeah it's uh this is something which people really need to start to become aware of because
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:22.160]  they're pushing this ufo thing really hard for like the past six months or so and if you notice
[1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:28.160]  all this ufo hype all this ufo talk it's coming from the pentagon you know and i was i was talking
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:32.480]  to my family the other day i said you know it would be one thing if there was some kind of viral
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:36.880]  video it would and that would be suspect in itself but it would be one thing if it was random if it
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.640]  was a new development he wanted a hundred people video time in central park exactly right if it
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:47.200]  was some kind of mass everybody saw it in the night sky but all of this is being pushed because
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:52.960]  the pentagon has decided to selectively now declassify things that have happened a long time ago
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:57.600]  and so the pentagon is pushing out there oh well you know we found this grainy footage of a ufo from
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:03.280]  five years ago and we decided to declassify that now barack obama is talking about it 60 minutes
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:08.960]  does a big special and now they're pushing this the state pushes the way to be credible to push
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:14.560]  off in the ufo's right because people look at this and they say oh well that's an air force pilot
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:18.640]  it's a general who said that i'm thinking it's a general wasn't it the generals that said they had
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:24.000]  weapons of mass destruction in iraq i mean these are people that lie to advance the agenda of the
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.720]  regime to advance the agenda of the state that makes it less credible if you weren't talking about it
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:33.760]  i would say okay alien invasion tomorrow when they talk about it i say you know what aliens may
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:38.640]  never exist right because they lie so people got to be very aware that i totally agree hey nick

[1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:20.160]  um all the different heart attacks and tests from the vaccines the attempt to create massive
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:26.320]  massive racial division in this country any subject you want to talk about anything you

[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:58.560]  callers agree disagree people that disagree call in very seldomly and sometimes i see
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:03.200]  them commenting online like all those are fake calls anyways i'm not gonna call in there uh
[1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:08.560]  no these aren't fake calls these are real calls real people and you can just call in and find out
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:22.880]  for yourself at 877-789-2539 you know we're not even supposed to have a debate about what's happening
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:26.720]  in the middle east what's happening with israel the palestinians um
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:32.240]  you either got people that say israel should be able to nuke the middle east
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:35.440]  or people that say israel should be blown up i don't agree with either of that
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:40.560]  and i understand geopolitically some other things are going on but i really look forward to tomorrow
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:47.440]  night at 6 p.m central kicking off a real debate the way debates were done on television 40 years
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:53.360]  ago the way they were done between lincoln and douglas 160 years ago 170 years ago
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:44:02.880]  where i'm just going to moderate and make sure that they get equal time and i'm going to let
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:12.000]  them ask each other questions and i'm not even going to give them what i plan to do other than
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.320]  it'll be an hour and a half debate and i bet you i talked four minutes during that hour and a half
[1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:22.480]  and just like a lincoln douglas debates if they want to keep going we'll just keep going
[1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:28.240]  because those old-fashioned debates might go five six hours
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:35.440]  and the reason i'm doing this is i think the israel palestine thing is important
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:42.240]  but compared to forced inoculations in total world government and tens of millions starving
[1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:48.960]  to death through the lockdowns it's it's small fry and again i'm not lessening it but it lessens
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:53.360]  the tens of millions starving to death from the covet lockdowns to not point out that's more important
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:45:03.120]  and beggar and so i really want to have a debate format here because they don't want real long
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:08.640]  form debates i want to do a good job of this debate to make sure both sides get the exact
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:16.320]  same amount of time so that we can host more debates here and so you're not going to get the
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:20.480]  customary alex jones that's bantering back and forth i've gotten better about not interrupting
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:27.920]  over the years and some guest hosts and some hosts and some guests are better at bantering back and
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:33.120]  forth uh kind of the talk radio format of old line conservatives have long droning interviews
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:37.040]  where one person talks for five minutes then another talks for five minutes we don't do that
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:42.320]  i talk a couple minutes they talk a couple minutes uh vice versa uh but you're not going
[1:45:42.320 --> 1:45:48.800]  to get that with this debate tomorrow night i have got a plan and it's basically let them debate
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:54.640]  but with the limitation of time constraints so that one person doesn't run over the other
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:45:59.520]  and then we're going to have harrison smith and no one shroyer in here i'm going to leave them
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:04.960]  the debate is over and they're going to host as long as they want as long as the crew wants
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.920]  to be here 30 minutes an hour or whatever to give their take and their view on it and they'll probably
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:15.520]  hopefully open the phones up i mean i haven't again planned it out that much because a real debate
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:21.680]  is supposed to be a free for all the globalists don't want that they want everything controlled
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:25.920]  these things they call debates today where there's three moderators and they ask their questions
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:30.880]  and then oh you get one minute and 30 second response and they control it by the questions
[1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:35.840]  that are asked a real debate should be the people debating that are the supposed experts
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:43.200]  battling it out themselves so what you're going to see tomorrow is a real debate and i actually
[1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:47.920]  went and pulled up a lingon douglas debate they got a transcript of it being pulled up at any
[1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:54.160]  university site you want and they're rhetoric departments and history departments and so i'm
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:59.280]  going to do as best i can uh that style of course those guys are just run on as long as they want it
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:04.080]  one would go on for 10 minutes one would go on for five minutes one would go on for 20 minutes
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:09.040]  one would go on for six minutes uh so again i'm going to stop talking about that at that at that
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:16.320]  point but i really want to be able to use this infrastructure we've got and that we've built
[1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:23.520]  and that you as listeners have built to have long-form podcasts and to have long-form debates and
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:29.760]  long-form discussions because that's what freedom is really all about and hearing from people you
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:34.720]  disagree with you know you can never get left us to come on a show because they're all so controlled
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:39.520]  by foundations and the foundations give them talking points and that's all they can say and they don't
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:44.480]  want them on shows that are free for them that's why the left wants to get rid of talk radio that's
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:48.320]  why they want internet censorship because they're authoritarians and they're dangerous ladies and
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:59.600]  gentlemen so again 877-789 alex and we will take your calls for the entirety of the third hour
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:07.280]  okay i got through two stacks today and i have all these other stacks here
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:12.080]  and so what i'm going to do
[1:48:15.680 --> 1:48:20.240]  is at the start of each segment i'll just read the stacks headlines and then go take calls
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:24.160]  but that way we at least get the headlines out there because it is simply incredible
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:31.840]  and all these different democrats again caught but also overseas all the leftists not following
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:36.640]  their own stupid code rules because they're not for them they're the ruling class they're never
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:41.200]  going to follow those rules that's why you got to have a system where everybody's got freedom
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:46.960]  because if everybody doesn't have freedom nobody has freedom and i played this a few weeks ago
[1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:52.240]  owens shroyer played it again last night when he hosted sunday live from 6 to 8 p.m and it's a little
[1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:59.600]  girl i think she's like five years old six years old and she's speaking in florida
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:08.240]  to the city council about ending the mass mandate of children and she just knocks it
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:14.640]  completely out of the park as the bible says out of the mouths of babes here it is
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:23.920]  and i don't think very anybody likes masks in schools their children are suffocating you
[1:49:23.920 --> 1:49:31.920]  don't know what it feels like and just it's nonsense seriously like why would you do that why in
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:39.680]  the world would you do that and and god created us so we can be free people and we're not being
[1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:48.880]  free here all at public schools okay so i would take a mask off if i were you and and i'm not wearing
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:58.080]  a mask right now and i never will as much as i can and in george washington made america so we
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:05.200]  could be three citizens of the united states of america and the statue of liberty is for liberty
[1:50:05.200 --> 1:50:11.200]  and freedom and we're not free so maybe you just don't believe in george washington or god
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:18.800]  or like the bowser here or someone is controlling you stand i want to get the full speech on
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:22.880]  there sometimes she says stand up and be free and that's not a scripted that's a little girl
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:28.080]  that's got the spirit of liberty in her see the full video take the mask off these children little
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:34.400]  girl goes to the city council there's an epic anti-mask rant to the school board that was being
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:42.880]  held the city council building okay um your calls are coming up and then trump sued for 22 million
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:48.880]  for calling covet china virus even if he was wrong he has that right of free speech but he's right
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:53.920]  and now it's all coming out the same what this group's suing me or suing trump they don't want
[1:50:53.920 --> 1:51:00.880]  us to have speech it's wrong we have the optimum trifecta sale that ends today on three of our

[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:18.560]  list goes on and on but what about the fact that falchi testified to congress and so did the head
[1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:27.520]  of the cdc in late may of 2021 that around half of the nyh cdc staff medical doctors
[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:31.600]  urologist scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they get safe yeah i think what

[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:19.360]  the workplaces into intimidating you into taking an experimental vaccine it'd be bad enough it was
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:26.000]  a regular one that violates nernberg code but to try to make you take an experimental authorization
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:32.640]  thing that's got such a bad history that's banned in many countries wow this is this is a scary time
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:40.720]  to be alive brother what's your take on this be a copy me yes i do sir awesome hey thanks for the
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:47.760]  time again alex i talked to oh and i think two or three weeks ago i just wanted to get this website

[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:10.080]  that that website i got out we talked to oh and about that and that's actually joey gilbert
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:16.160]  he's a lawyer down there out of Nevada and so i called down there last week about this and talked
[1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:22.400]  to one of his assistant lawyers and had a good conversation but regardless this is what happened
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:29.040]  basically in the heat of the mass stuff a few months ago i'm a subcontractor i do transportation
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:34.880]  uh parts delivery and uh i walked into this auto parts place i'm not going to give the name of it
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:41.760]  but i should but i won't um and i walked into this place and uh didn't have the mask on of course
[1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:48.640]  i'm not going to be muzzled and uh they take a still photo from their security camera
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:55.280]  send it to my contractor that i support and threaten my my job over it over not having a
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:05.120]  mask so i call the local lawyer here out of Omaha and uh he said that it's a right to work state
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:10.560]  there's nothing you can do about it so then i started digging deeper of course alex and
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:15.280]  called more lawyers and then i got a hold of this this gal uh that works for joey gilbert
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:23.840]  he was uh i'm i think you've had him on before he was a fighter before kickboxer the boxer i believe

[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:48.320]  basically can't what make your employees do it the media has given us almost no coverage so i
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:52.880]  talked to a lot of people around austin since this happened a few weeks ago and most of them still
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:58.080]  think you have to wear a mask so it's all color of law people perish for lack of knowledge texas
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:03.040]  governor Abbott threatens to find cities and local government officials if they impose
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:10.800]  mass mandates that's cnbc spin no he signed an executive order and i showed that executive order

[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:47.200]  system everybody has those two gears of the nervous system and how many breaths per minute
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:51.840]  determine where your consciousness is either in the fight or flight which is sympathetic or if
[2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:55.200]  you're breathing 18 or more breaths per minute you're going to be i mean if you're breathing 18
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:59.120]  or more breaths per minute you're going to be in the sympathetic if you're breathing less
[2:03:59.120 --> 2:04:02.880]  four or less per minute you're going to be in parasympathetic that's right they admit the studies
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:09.600]  of these mass cut oxygen levels cause anxiety take years off your life yeah and the more that we breathe
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:13.200]  shallow the more our life is going to be shallow because the breath is the spirit and that's what
[2:04:13.200 --> 2:04:17.760]  we manifest with so the breath is the spirit the consciousness is the father the will is the son
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:22.480]  that's just the trinity to me and i feel like as a human organism if they tamper with our rhythm
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:27.040]  with our breath algorithm like that and keep us in a sympathetic state then we can only manifest
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:32.640]  them in a mass sense from that place and the human organism it doesn't take much to tamper with the
[2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:37.920]  homeostasis of the whole organism to where now we have a mass of basically a cancerous mass of
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:43.120]  humanity that we all have to now somehow heal by changing this algorithm because that's the spiritual
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:47.760]  algorithm the breath algorithm the breath is the spirit like Tucker Carlson said a week ago or so
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:54.080]  and notice that all over the country the left isn't taking the mask off and they want it to be
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:05:00.480]  permanent i mean this is a real cult programming we've just seen oh definitely i mean and that's
[2:05:00.480 --> 2:05:05.520]  the thing the whole the whole uh transhumanism you know you know about the blockchain and everything
[2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:09.760]  every breath is is an investment we're taking our investment we're trading our breath for money
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:13.520]  we're trading our breath for all these things and they know if we're in a shallow state and then
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:17.360]  we're breathing we're breathing from that place we're thinking shallow then our emotions and everything
[2:05:17.360 --> 2:05:22.400]  follow from that casey casey you're absolutely right and i'm so glad you called because i was
[2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:26.240]  having a lot of concern this weekend about the world and but i wasn't doing enough to fight the
[2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:31.680]  globalist and i literally sat in a room for about two hours once my family gone to bed asking god
[2:05:32.240 --> 2:05:37.440]  what do i need to do and god was like he'd get calm on air more you need to smooth out and breathe
[2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:42.640]  more and get other people to be calm to then take action you know it's been good that you've been
[2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:46.240]  aggressive to get people out of their trance and it's good because those people are already in that
[2:05:46.240 --> 2:05:51.680]  type of you know hyped up state but now we got to get people out of that state and get them calm
[2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:56.880]  and that starts with you and so i've been went on off air trying to breathe deeper and more when
[2:05:56.880 --> 2:06:01.040]  i'm on air i even almost quit breathing because i get so upset looking at all this it just drives me
[2:06:01.040 --> 2:06:06.240]  crazy yeah i know definitely and they just they try to keep us from that infantile state because
[2:06:06.240 --> 2:06:10.320]  they know that when we have children and we're around children babies breathe from their diaphragm
[2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:14.800]  fully from their diaphragm and they fully experience life it's just we're not we're in a
[2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:19.280]  shallow place when everybody's so traumatized and the trauma creates the shallow breathing
[2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:23.600]  and then it compounds that that whole problem and explain to us how you understand this case
[2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:27.920]  because you're dead on and all the basic research shows this and the globalists know this so teach
[2:06:27.920 --> 2:06:33.360]  me teach the listeners explain this to people well like i was saying there's two we have two
[2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:38.720]  nervous system and if we're breathing four or less full breaths per minute like babies do expanding
[2:06:38.720 --> 2:06:44.320]  the diaphragm fully you know expanding the belly so that the lower lungs can expand fully that's
[2:06:44.320 --> 2:06:48.080]  where more of the blood in the lungs is because you know gravity so there's more blood in the lower
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:52.720]  lungs and we're not expanding the lower lungs and we're constantly in a rushed state and you know
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:57.520]  honestly it's all alignment creation is alignment and god does not rush so the more that we rush the
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:00.640]  more that we're in a rushed state the more that we're getting away from that alignment and the
[2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:04.800]  alignment is the only protection we have so it's really our spiritual alignment is our breath
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:08.560]  alignment and that has everything to do with our circadian rhythm and how many breaths per minute
[2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:12.080]  we're breathing because that controls our consciousness where our consciousness is headed
[2:07:12.080 --> 2:07:16.480]  and we're in our children our ancestors so we're setting up this rhythm this breath this spiritual
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:20.960]  and you know that rhythm so if we're hurried and rushed and the children see that example that they
[2:07:20.960 --> 2:07:25.520]  create from that platform and it's a more broken template and then the more that we get and just
[2:07:25.520 --> 2:07:29.840]  accept the breath and we people call it breath work but it's acceptance we need to accept the
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:34.320]  spirit accept the breath and and we can fully breathe and we can fully live and then we can
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:38.640]  slow things down and we have less thoughts per minute and then we can we're really we're creating
[2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:44.400]  and exactly slowing things down gives you more time not less and i think god's work through me
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:48.640]  in the hyped up system to get to people that were already in the hyped up system but now
[2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:57.040]  it's time to to pull people out of the sped up controlled system and get them in to that relaxed
[2:07:57.040 --> 2:08:00.800]  quiet place the most high that king david talked about you're absolutely right because when i'd
[2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:07.760]  make myself lay there on the bed you know for like an hour and breathe i mean i just my thoughts
[2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:13.920]  get so clear i get so relaxed i can see infinity and then i dream a lot better at night and i get
[2:08:13.920 --> 2:08:18.880]  answers now we don't want to be in a zombie what do you call the zombie state because some people
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:22.960]  are running around like chickens with their heads cut off scared of the globalist and doing everything
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:29.360]  they say others are kind of in a zombie format but but it even seems like they're breathing shallow
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:35.200]  as well but they're just completely gone yeah i mean it really comes down to how much we effort
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:40.000]  the breath is inhabiting the body like you alex you know you've you've been circulating your blood
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:43.840]  you've been starting to be even breathing on air you've been connecting with people bouncing the
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:47.680]  breath off of people because every activity is really the breath in a different way you know a
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:53.040]  different pace or whatever it is so the more that a person is accepting the breath the more
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:56.480]  that they're going to accept life and the more that they can exude that into life and then people
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:00.720]  can operate from that place but if you're not accepting the breath then god can't come through
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:05.600]  you so then you got a bunch of bodies that are not inhabited they're just not fully inhabited the
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:11.840]  circulation of the well also uh exactly but if you read um the first book of the bible it says
[2:09:11.840 --> 2:09:17.840]  god created the world with his breath go ahead yes and that's exactly so the breath the more that
[2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:21.280]  you're breathing the greater your circulation is and then the more and the more that you're in a
[2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:24.880]  parasympathetic state the more that you're circulating to the organ the more that you're
[2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:29.040]  in a sympathetic state the fight or flight that they got a clock into the more that your your
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:32.880]  blood is in your tissue and then more because you're more on fire flight you're constantly ready to go
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:37.680]  to war so it's just the endocrine system what people call the chakra system is really the
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.600]  endocrine system and you know you the more as you become conscious you're doing that's right it's
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:45.920]  not mumbo jumbo it's science we got to get the blood into our brain god bless you sir we'll be right
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:54.560]  back thanks for taking me i'm a very humble person but i'm also a bold person and so as
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:58.400]  bad as things are with the globalist attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:05.120]  unfolding i want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well i'm a public figure so
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:09.520]  i get to see things zero public doesn't get to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:16.880]  or members of congress or even folks in hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:21.680]  really really away from the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalist but
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:27.200]  they're scared they're looking for leadership well that's where info comes in you fund us
[2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:32.480]  you support info or store.com you get rape proxy at the same time we will then go out and do what the
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:38.080]  globalist says unpopular but the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:44.800]  tell the truth and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the bar
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:49.600]  wire so we can be the shock groups and the information war fund us at info or store.com
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:55.600]  i'm not going to say this five times in a row to the obnoxious i'm saying it because it's the key
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:11:03.200]  to victory over these criminals last week the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:10.000]  the cdc's top brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it have taken the
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:16.160]  so-called COVID-19 frankenshot i'm gonna say the second time around half of the doctors
[2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:24.880]  at the cdc and nih refused to take the frankenshots they don't trust it you shouldn't trust it the
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:29.600]  vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world this is an attack on the american people
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:35.840]  in the people of the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again let me say it two more times
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:41.760]  around half the individuals that work at the niasian cdc the medical staff refused to take
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:47.120]  the vaccines that's right the doctors nurses and scientists do not trust a so-called vaccine
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:55.360]  you you shouldn't either you want everyone you know about the truth you're listening to the alex
[2:11:55.360 --> 2:12:21.440]  jones show i just feel frustrated and really upset and sad for humanity because we know the
[2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:25.760]  new world order is here to kill everybody we know they're poisoning the food and water we know they're
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:32.400]  turning us against each other we know that they are trying to suppress us so that we're not with
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:38.240]  god and it's very very frustrating it's very very sad and and we all feel like we've got to be able
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:43.040]  to change it we've got to be able to overturn it but it's that endless battle between good and evil
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:47.600]  and evil is making its move right now like it's never done before in the history of our species
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:53.120]  on this planet and we can all feel it we can all see it but i have to remind myself every moment
[2:12:53.120 --> 2:13:00.560]  just do the best i can and gobble do the rest i was under so much stress you know wanting
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:05.840]  trump to succeed wanting trump to be real and i think overall trump was a good person is a good
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:11.840]  person but we couldn't expect trump to overturn and defeat this globalist system himself we have
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:17.760]  to do with god so and so after they stole the election from him and after we saw all that i don't
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:23.040]  want to say a great weight came off of me but i just realized that we're not going to stop their
[2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:28.080]  attempt at the great reset their attempt to bankrupt the planet their attempt to take our
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:33.120]  children from us their attempt to poison us they said they're going to do it they mean business
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:39.520]  so we're going to have to oppose it and stand up to it and say no and fight it and if we get
[2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:47.360]  aggressive and if we get up on our hind legs and we take a deep breath and decide that we're going to
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:52.720]  get our hands dirty here we're going to win this fight and i know we're going to win because evil
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:57.600]  always pushes till they make good people stand up the question is how bad is it going to get before
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:02.960]  we do that and the biggest thing is saying no to oppressors saying no to the mass police saying no to
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:08.560]  their poisonous inoculation and going on the offense to their inoculation centers and exposing
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:13.600]  that it's poison and and going to their health departments and exposing them and your employer
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:18.720]  tries to make you take a shot that's experimental that violates the nuremberg code bring them
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:24.160]  information educate them say people don't want this this is banned in europe chances are your
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:29.040]  employers being told by lawyers they better do this or they'll be liability they'll be liability
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:38.400]  if they try to make you take that shot see the left bullies and sews and pushes us around it's
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:42.320]  time for us to start pushing them back because we didn't start this fight we're going to finish it
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:51.520]  all right we got antonio and jason and kyle and andy and debbie and so many others but we got
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:57.120]  jason in germany so i'm going to go to jason jason case you're having to pay for your call
[2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:04.880]  yourself jason in germany go ahead you're on the air can you hear me yes or go ahead okay yeah
[2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:14.000]  thanks i'm a first-time caller i wanted to talk about the entire covid situation how it parallels
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:29.200]  to the nazi takeover and i'm talking like about before 1939 you back in the day you already had
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:38.240]  that there was a lot of propaganda against the jews these days you're also seeing it against
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:48.080]  people who refused to take the vaccine who refused to wear masks and you also had the
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:58.480]  gestapo nowadays you have basically the regular police doing the same job i don't know closing
[2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:07.040]  churches going after people who don't wear their masks properly instead of going after real criminals
[2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:17.920]  and all the things they they are saying they only they just want to put like two vaccines into us
[2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:24.640]  but that it's not going to stop with them absolutely i mean that's why they admit the
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:30.000]  EU is modeled basically off the hitlerian system and they need the excuse to train the police to
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:35.120]  violate people's rights to have martial law and and to check people's papers and and to disappear
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:40.000]  them and so now germany is one of the most clamped down countries in the world this is all done under
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:46.880]  the eun auspices tell folks what it's like to live in germany right now i mean right now in germany
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:56.800]  we do have kind of a lockdown i mean where i live if the covid
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:06.240]  in infection numbers like over 90 over 100 all schools and stuff like that get closed
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:17.040]  um if it's below 100 um they reopen but i think restaurants and the likes are still closed and
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:21.760]  again instead of the u n it's all the pcr tests i know germany's still doing it at 39 or 40 so
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:28.320]  when they want they just turn up the pcr test everybody's locked up it's a perfect uh governor
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:34.480]  over everybody yes and the more people give in to it the more they're going to take because
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:40.880]  um people think that these guys have some kind kind of conscious their conscience that there
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:48.080]  there will be a point where they will feel bad for us or something and they will stop but um these
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:54.320]  people are absolute psychopaths they are not going to stop they're going to go as far as you let them
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:18:03.440]  and it's not going to stop with a few vaccines later on it's going to be um as you talked about
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:17.360]  uh microchips and they are probably bite even uh try to um execute people who won't uh take
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:25.040]  uh these chips in the future once they um get their way basically because history has also
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:31.600]  shown that you can pretty much get humans to do whatever you want as long as you condition them
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:42.480]  over a very long time and um basically the human are these uh so-called um mask refusers and anti-vaxxers
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:53.600]  um so it's if they succeed then it's going to be a very dark future um but as far as I'm seeing
[2:18:54.320 --> 2:19:00.480]  it is getting exposed especially that the coronavirus came from the Wuhan lab even
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:06.560]  and Michelle she admitting to it um you also have the governor of Texas doing a lot of work
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:13.120]  even more than I expected I mean personally when I looked at this guy I didn't expect this kind of
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:18.080]  work from him oh I totally agree uh he's now gone further than DeSantis because of pressure
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:22.320]  and said we'll find you a thousand dollars you make money wear a mask uh he says therapeutics
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:27.440]  for the way take your vitamins this thing's exaggerated overblown 100 times what it actually
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:32.560]  was and he's starting to address it and so I'm glad that the governor's doing that and you're
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:37.520]  absolutely right people like the Texas governor the Florida governor that's an example to the world
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:43.440]  but again water cannons attacking Germans in mass arresting people you have a government minister
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:49.680]  saying outlaw people criticizing the lockdown I mean don't the Germans see that the very same thing
[2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:52.880]  that they were under in the 40s is back again under a new cover
[2:19:52.880 --> 2:20:04.160]  yes I mean definitely and um the thing is uh I am someone who believes in metaphysical law
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:10.160]  and uh I think that I mean what's going on in Texas is great and the things that
[2:20:11.120 --> 2:20:17.760]  DeSantis does but I think that that's not going to go on for a very long time and
[2:20:17.760 --> 2:20:28.880]  um these uh the powers that we are planning some kind of um uh they will strike back that's what I
[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:34.000]  think because I totally agree that they admit sir this is all a beta test some areas they'll
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:38.240]  loosen the restrictions they're going to come back even harder as Bill Gates said a more deadly
[2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:42.960]  virus is on the way we have to expose them we have to expose that they stood to gain from it
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  we have to expose and make money off of it it's the great reset we have to have them arrested
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:51.520]  with Nuremberg too God bless you when listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done

[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:04.080]  the beast and me
[2:24:04.080 --> 2:24:12.640]  me is caged by frail and fragile bars
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:24.560]  restless by day and by night rancid rages at the start
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:35.040]  are think about it god help the beast and me the fact that they have decided to add
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:39.360]  the chemicals the food and water to totally sterilize this and when they tell you that
[2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:43.200]  at current graph and there's a whole bunch of studies on this they show the same numbers
[2:24:43.200 --> 2:24:49.280]  it's conclusive that by 2045 2047 depending on the study there will be no one with any sperm left
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:53.920]  well then they're going to have the medicalization and create humanoids artificially and
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:59.360]  laboratory so that you can have children the goal wasn't just to put trojan horses
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:07.120]  genetically in gmo crops or digital trojan horses in your cell phones it's in your body
[2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:14.240]  they want and once corporations and governments control procreation as you saw in that national
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:20.480]  news piece from hbo that oh they'll still be sex it just will be in a laboratory well those won't
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:26.960]  be humans and so this is really a scientific takeover and they're already with this covet
[2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:32.800]  attack and forced inoculations with an experimental gene therapy taking us 80 of the way there
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:37.680]  they're not eating around the edges anymore incrementally they've only gotten five percent
[2:25:37.680 --> 2:25:44.960]  of the way there they're now leaping forward with hey we're going to put in your body what we
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:48.960]  want the changes every cell in your body we're not going to tell you even what it does and
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:52.880]  when it makes you sick we're going to cover it up and when scientists expose it we're going to censor
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:26:00.320]  them and that's what they're doing so this isn't a little bit of tyranny there they've now gone
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:06.720]  from beta to their full assault and you can deny it you hope it's going to go away it doesn't go
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:14.960]  away until we understand where it takes us and we say no this is so illegal so authoritarian
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:19.760]  and now they're trying to hope employers will go do what the health department can't do what the
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:25.360]  government can't do make you take a shot to have your job how's that job going to do for you when
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:32.160]  you uh get a neurological disorder in six months or heart attack that day they're just managing to
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:36.240]  see if we'll make a big deal because they make a big deal out of all people dying from the shots
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:41.360]  it already be stopped and remember where's all the infertility it's in the western world the
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  globalists are getting rid of us and it's not just white people they're getting rid of they're
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:50.560]  getting rid of any country where people have due process and infrastructure there's a war
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:54.560]  on infrastructure and the globalists are finally trying to get rid of progress and saying we have
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:27:05.520]  world government enforceable chips in your body they're teaching you to be poor they're
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:10.480]  teaching you to be a slave they're teaching you it's virtuous and good and they're teaching you
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:15.680]  to ignore the science how they lied about COVID-19 this entire time all right let's get to all the
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:20.800]  calls for the Sauer ends who's up next year let's go to Cindy in West Virginia Cindy welcome you're
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:30.000]  on the air hey Alex welcome hey um of course I just have to say this okay Chantilly Virginia
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:37.040]  Bilderberg 2012 I believe it was you met my son Colin Abramowitz he was in the london guardian
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:44.960]  with you awesome oh so proud of my kids you know I have four two of them are woke I shouldn't say
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:52.080]  woke two of them know what's going on I think two of them are too afraid you know I was thinking
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:56.000]  about that during the break before you tell us you know your points which I want to hear desperately
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:02.480]  that this is so big only God can handle this I mean I don't want to say I'm scared I'm scared
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:07.280]  I'm not doing enough to fight it because I always knew they were planning this but now it's moving
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:13.120]  so quick I'm just totally bummed out and horrified I mean I want to live my life I want yeah and so
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:17.840]  I know why people get in denial because you don't want to admit to yourself that you're in this
[2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:23.120]  situation but here's the deal it's going to get so bad that you don't want to be at that point when
[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:28.080]  most people wake up but it's too late for them does that make sense yeah absolutely and you know
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:33.760]  we do you know it's not about us Alex it's about our kids and our grandkids you know you're you're
[2:28:33.760 --> 2:28:38.640]  a little younger than me I think but we've lived our lives you know for the most part so what kind
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:45.280]  of life do we want to have for our kids so it you know if this stuff scares you you just have to
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:50.320]  buck up and like look at your children look at your grandchildren are you going to let them grow up
[2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:58.080]  to be slaves to these demons I mean we see what they do to children right it's absolutely insane
[2:28:58.880 --> 2:29:05.280]  you called it about COVID and depopulation and major crop losses coming give us your view on that
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:11.440]  okay so you know how there's systems and everything and there's cyclical cycles right
[2:29:11.440 --> 2:29:17.760]  like the Atlantic current has a cycle that it goes by the sun has many cycles you know
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:27.200]  and many scientists believe if you look at like one YouTube channel adapt 2030 that's
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:32.000]  a good place to look or look up grand solar minimum they think we're coming up on another
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:38.240]  grand solar minimum and if you look at history and when that's happened it has to do with the
[2:29:38.240 --> 2:29:45.520]  sun's cycles and all of us right every so many hundred years this happens when this happens
[2:29:45.520 --> 2:29:54.960]  there tend to be food losses crop losses food shortages often upheavals like volcanoes
[2:29:55.760 --> 2:30:01.120]  and a lot of earthquakes okay it's like an electromagnetic thing that happens I don't
[2:30:01.120 --> 2:30:07.040]  understand it completely but if you look at the chart and you look at the time I've had major
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:11.520]  major banking experts and people that advise multi-million dollar corporations they totally
[2:30:11.520 --> 2:30:17.120]  agree they follow up sunspots back thousands of years yep and that's when all the big major
[2:30:17.120 --> 2:30:22.320]  wars happen and all this is during these solar minimums and so you're absolutely right plus
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:27.760]  you already see food prices exploding you see bill gates buying up all the farmland yeah I mean
[2:30:27.760 --> 2:30:35.760]  that's scary remember bush bought up all that does aquifer areas in uh south america yes yeah
[2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:42.800]  so that's another thing there could be water shortages too so um I think that this COVID
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:49.120]  dang and even before the COVID thing that the depopulation because what they're doing to the
[2:30:49.120 --> 2:30:54.400]  food and the water it's not any one thing it's all these different things combined so you don't
[2:30:54.400 --> 2:30:59.360]  really say aha is this or here's what's going on man we've already been hit
[2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:06.880]  by the first salvo of the takeover I mean I mean let's use a tom cruise movie that's actually
[2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:12.240]  pretty good I don't like tom cruise but I like the movie and that's oblivion and everything
[2:31:12.240 --> 2:31:17.360]  isn't what it seems and he's really a clone working for the aliens he's an astronaut you know that
[2:31:17.360 --> 2:31:22.960]  they captured and cloned and notice when the aliens hit the first thing they do is blow up the moon
[2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:30.880]  to destroy the earth cycles and cause earthquakes and problems and then they land spaceships with
[2:31:30.880 --> 2:31:33.760]  all these clones they produced because you obviously want to produce something those
[2:31:33.760 --> 2:31:38.320]  are the final planet it's from and it's just a very important movie because it it's it's
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:42.800]  but but that's exactly what they're doing the globalists are sucking the energy out of the earth
[2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:47.840]  stealing all the resources and building a breakaway civilization and the point I wanted to make today
[2:31:47.840 --> 2:31:52.560]  that I'm now going to make is the breakaway further than we think they're way advanced they've
[2:31:52.560 --> 2:31:56.560]  already got incredible life extension they've already got super technology beyond what you can
[2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:02.400]  even hardly imagine but it's evil hunchback inbred globalists that own it and run it and so they
[2:32:02.400 --> 2:32:07.920]  are making the decision to cauterize us to get rid of us so that we don't get in the way of what
[2:32:07.920 --> 2:32:12.880]  they're about to do because when when it's finally clear they're going to suck up all the resources
[2:32:14.160 --> 2:32:20.560]  and they they say in their writings they're going to build these giant spaceships and leave the
[2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:26.720]  planet once they merge with silicon it's it's just it's and they don't say aliens pull them to do this
[2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:31.200]  but they're like this is the plan we must follow the plan earth is over it is the end of humans
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:37.680]  we are leaving and and it goes back to their acolytes uh artisty clark wrote his first book
[2:32:37.680 --> 2:32:41.920]  that the system picked up he was in british intelligence and much stuff they wanted his
[2:32:41.920 --> 2:32:47.760]  first big book to make him a superstar childhoods end uh to explain all this and they tell you in
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:54.560]  childhoods end the allegory of what they're doing does that make sense i want to get another point
[2:32:54.560 --> 2:33:02.880]  in okay too if i may go ahead if anyone out there if you haven't seen the movie they live okay um you
[2:33:02.880 --> 2:33:10.000]  should watch that because you know they try to keep us in trance on this other frequency um and the
[2:33:10.000 --> 2:33:17.920]  word tell a vision turn it off okay and ma'am i totally agree with a lot of time yes i interviewed
[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:22.960]  rowdy piper the movie movie's incredible uh that we we made some like 10 minute reports on they live
[2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:27.120]  that we should repost demand our video so much of our work never got posted there because it got blown
[2:33:27.120 --> 2:33:31.360]  off of uh off of youtube but we're gonna find it and we're gonna get it out there but absolutely
[2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:36.800]  they put us in this unconscious frequency where we sleep and then they live they live because
[2:33:36.800 --> 2:33:43.040]  they live their conscious we sleep we're basically dead we must awaken the sleeper must awaken
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:51.840]  we'll be right back stay with us info wars dot com globalist puppet joe biden wasted no time blaming
[2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:57.680]  russia with no evidence for the shutdown of the east coast gasoline pipeline that goes from
[2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:02.800]  houston right up through new york city supplies more than half of the gasoline of the east coast
[2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:08.320]  but who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from canada through the midwest to houston
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:14.240]  to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and simply the east coast that's right joe biden shut
[2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:20.320]  down the keystone pipeline right after it was completed joe biden did that to america he has
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:25.440]  the history he has the background he's the one that promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:31.120]  he's the one that's trying to extend the lockdowns of the country remember ladies and gentlemen
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:35.600]  but the new world order wants a post industrial world and they want the united states europe and
[2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:41.200]  australia cripples of communist china can't be dominant it's not russia that's the enemy it's
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:46.480]  communist china and their millions like joe biden in control of the white house that's the facts
[2:34:46.480 --> 2:34:53.920]  that's the information your brain your heart your bones your liver your eyes everything

[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:46.160]  hey alex um i called today because i feel like my brain's exploding the amount of information
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:55.360]  i jet i jet on a daily basis but i have four uh issues and observations i i wanted to make while
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:40:00.640]  on this call so he gave me a couple minutes to go through those four sure hey i love you calling
[2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:04.960]  what everybody does is they they do like a call screening with me i'm not screening your call
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:10.560]  you're live on air so just go ahead and hit it brother so first one is uh one of the songs i used
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:15.840]  to listen to is by flowbot it's called bite with tools so if you can look at those lyrics it talks
[2:40:15.840 --> 2:40:22.640]  about babies and beakers precious metals global virus by g and tennis schools and the propaganda
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:30.560]  media and this was written in 2007 and again that's flowbot song is bite with tools uh
[2:40:30.560 --> 2:40:38.080]  number two uh hb 547 it's a bill in texas i haven't had time to research this bill in particular
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:44.880]  but it's from a source that i listened to and they said that this bill is on abbott's table
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:52.480]  and it's going to regulate homeschooling uh so it's going to regulate the homeschoolers the death
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:41:02.160]  and that wow that's in texas i'll have to look into hb 547 yeah 547 it's um at tim tebow slash
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:08.480]  uil equal access and it's on abbott's table right now so uh that's something to look into i haven't
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:13.840]  looked at it early but uh if you're in texas so it's probably really important for homeschooling
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:18.080]  families out there and just going to regulate it like like they do the farms and such everywhere else
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:25.360]  and uh could be a possible for people to homeschool their children um number three was the pharmaceutical
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:33.600]  cult uh reading a lot of cult books lately and uh kubrick films and i noticed that all the all
[2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:41.040]  the cults have masks and gowns and people we look up to now are all doctors and nurses who also
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:47.280]  have masks and gowns and well yeah the original cults were medical they were architectural
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:53.520]  and medical and then also uh had to deal with astrology and astronomy and so yes those are all
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:42:01.040]  occult garbs in fact if you look at uh court in in in pleadings you pray to the court uh all of it
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:08.240]  is uh ritualistic magic yeah and then pharmacology comes from well established by a rockfeller
[2:42:08.240 --> 2:42:14.240]  institution and also pharmacology comes from the word pharmacia which means sorcery spells and
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:20.320]  witchcraft that's kind of weird well the symbol of medicine uh goes back before even Babylon uh
[2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:26.240]  and and the hittites and people and again it was two snakes around a staff which is the DNA
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:31.440]  yeah uh we've been here before thank you so much Kyle get here from you let's go ahead now and talk
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:40.400]  to Debbie in the great state of Indiana go ahead Debbie hi Alex welcome first time caller
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:48.560]  long-time listener um i went to doctor today and she was trying to force me to take the corona virus
[2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:55.440]  Sean i kept arguing with her and she said why i said because it's experimental and it's poison
[2:42:56.160 --> 2:43:02.160]  and she's got kind of mad she's like that's a lie they've been developing it for 25 years
[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:06.080]  and she still kept pushing them yeah and they couldn't get them approved because they killed
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:11.280]  the lab rats that's why they skipped animal trials but see oh john oliver goes oh it's not
[2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:15.200]  re-experimental this has been spending for 20 years yeah no one would approve it and they're
[2:43:15.200 --> 2:43:22.960]  banned in india and china uh did you hit her back with that no but she kept on to arguing and i
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:28.800]  brought up the Nuremberg code and she's like what do you know about it i said i don't have to take
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:38.560]  that and she's telling me she got it and nurses got it and then she goes well you're diabetic you
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:44.160]  really should get it and i said no if i'm gonna die i'm gonna die by myself well man if you have
[2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:49.840]  the vitamins and minerals as you know and and i mean you're really really doing well but but
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:54.480]  god bless you you know you probably want to get a different doctor have you thought about that
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:44:02.560]  uh you know it kind of shocked me because she never said anything to me like right after
[2:44:02.560 --> 2:44:11.520]  the stuff started going on uh when i go back to her if she does it again yeah i will get another
[2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:16.960]  doctor well i think the thing you should do is why don't you send her some of the articles

[2:44:22.160 --> 2:44:29.120]  and shot was she trying to give you you didn't say but you know i'm blind so there
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:34.720]  right no way i can get all of that information yeah well they really take advantage of disabled
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:38.320]  people but we know you're not disabled you have the sight of understanding and that's the most
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:46.960]  important yeah a lot of people i know well we go to campground and a lot of those people down there
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:53.760]  said they're not doing it there's been a few but there's more that said no absolutely yeah don't

[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:50.640]  well no it's operated by a human being and this human being has done this um we went to court for
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:48:01.440]  this and uh he did it three times before my mother and uh now every time he screws up
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:10.080]  if it's a screw up he just skipped state and uh well you're right they're always saying robots
[2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:13.360]  are so great and the system pushes them even though there's malpractice it's a lot higher
[2:48:13.360 --> 2:48:16.720]  with them because they want to replace humans with them they're actually using human doctors
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:20.880]  that are doing the surgery are training the robot in the future to have no human there i'm really
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:26.560]  sorry to hear about your mother god bless you yeah the robot takeover is not a pretty situation
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:30.560]  ladies and gentlemen and the secret about the robots is we're training them to replace us
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:35.600]  it's one hell of a world we live in folks stay with us we'll be right back
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:43.120]  one of the most common questions i get on air but also off air when i'm just out and about is
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:50.080]  alex what do i say to my family about the vaccines how do i warn them well the problem is
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:55.040]  there's so many problems with it so many facts it's the history of contaminated vaccines the fact
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:48:59.760]  that they have liability protection in the u.s and europe the fact that they've been caught adding
[2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:05.600]  sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole history of secret experimentation
[2:49:05.600 --> 2:49:10.720]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites native americans the list goes on and on but
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:16.720]  what about the fact that fauci testified to congress and so did the head of the cdc in late
[2:49:16.720 --> 2:49:24.720]  may of 2021 that around half of the nih cdc staff medical doctors orologist scientists have refused
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:29.360]  to take the vaccine until they can say yeah i think what half of the doctors are scared to
[2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:32.880]  take it that's the same thing in the private practices out there somewhere numbers that that's
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:39.520]  not something i'm going to be taking that's very very simple there's your answer all of the experts

[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:28.800]  what she took and what happened hey alex uh i'm excited to be here uh well quickly about my it's
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:35.040]  actually my mom's aunt and she was elderly she was in her 80s but she was smart as the wet very
[2:51:35.040 --> 2:51:41.040]  alert always has been can budget a checkbook um no problems she had her first shot i think it was the
[2:51:41.040 --> 2:51:47.920]  moderna um which info wars unplugging uh you guys are great you guys help wake my whole family up
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:52.880]  my mom tried telling her don't take the vaccine please don't take the vaccine but her own children
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:52:00.080]  advisor to do it she got the second dose and then out of nowhere she fell at her house and was
[2:52:00.080 --> 2:52:07.120]  and a doctor pretty much said she was experiencing symptoms of bell palsy and within a week they had
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:12.160]  her in the hospital like i said she was balancing a checkbook she got the second shot and then within
[2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:18.320]  like a week and a half after that she's in a nursing home that's exactly what is in the news but
[2:52:19.280 --> 2:52:24.400]  guests or doctors and and working nursing homes have told us and nurses is that you'll have a
[2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:28.800]  whole nursing home that's up and happy and you know watching tv and playing poker and eating
[2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:33.280]  dinner and they'll all just disappear and not come out of their beds for a few weeks and then up to
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:41.040]  20 die it was i mean it was also i mean it was completely awful it devastated my mom
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:46.640]  home and everything like that and uh and honestly i mean i don't know what the issue is i think her
[2:52:46.640 --> 2:52:52.400]  son's wife um i think there's like a wedge in between them so i think they were kind of the
[2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:56.160]  ones that were pushing the vaccine on her well look out because the more deaths there is the
[2:52:56.160 --> 2:52:59.920]  more that these crazies are going to push it you understand they're going to defend what they've
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:03.680]  already pushed they'll never admit they're wrong so is your family going to get aggressive now and
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:09.440]  say you can't stay away with your deadly shots i mean like i was going to say man my mother i put
[2:53:09.440 --> 2:53:14.640]  her on and my dad but they're most major fans of the show and we always listen and we always try to

[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:31.040]  i'd love to see you and the crew look into some of gay patents that involved first uh re-infusing
[2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:36.400]  artificially artificially re-infusing plants with carbon dioxide you know it's so critical
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:42.000]  that you get rid of carbon dioxide but he has patents on re-infusing plants with carbon dioxide
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:48.080]  i actually got patents on cutting them down and burying them yes yeah and and he plans to re-infuse
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:55.840]  but also uh he has patents you know if the 5g towers are not nefarious not a threat to humans
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:55:01.920]  why does he have patents on uh camouflaging them and making them blend in with the environment
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:06.800]  where they can't be seen is i don't understand the whole patent but it'll well yeah the foundation
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:12.720]  he runs is all about killing us and so everything he does is is about that yes ma'am i and last i just
[2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:19.600]  wanted to say we've always supported israel and netanyahu but he really lost us when he decided
[2:55:19.600 --> 2:55:24.000]  he's going to make everybody take the vaccine get the bracelets and talk to us stay right there
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:27.600]  because he lost me there too and i wasn't like a huge supporter but i'm not against those real
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:32.560]  money against netanyahu i'm sure we don't support the islamicist but uh when when he went along with

[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:46.480]  help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal pediatrics these new studies suggest
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:50.800]  that the opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior

[2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:41.280]  so
[2:58:44.320 --> 2:58:50.400]  trends research dot com the number one trends forecaster in the world the mighty
[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:56.880]  jerald salante will take over in about four minutes i wanted to finish up with helen talking
[2:58:56.880 --> 2:59:02.560]  about israel and net and yahoo absolutely i don't fetishize the palestinians uh but i don't like
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:07.120]  the plight they're under but i know the left's backing them but that doesn't mean it's just
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:15.120]  the left's against for somebody uh you know that they're all bad but at the same time net and yahoo
[2:59:16.160 --> 2:59:21.120]  literally the freedom bracelets saying we want kids to all have chips he was the first to do that
[2:59:21.120 --> 2:59:27.120]  now you know claus swabs pushing it and just what israel's doing is very very dangerous very very
[2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:33.120]  oppressive and it's really the vanguard now of the rollout of forced inoculation they're rounding up
[2:59:33.120 --> 2:59:38.400]  all those ultra orthodox conservative jews uh and and not letting them you know leave their own
[2:59:38.400 --> 2:59:43.920]  houses or have their own uh church services at their synagogues and so when i look across the
[2:59:43.920 --> 2:59:48.400]  world i see net and yahoo really involved in some major tyranny you were trying to get to that point
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:54.240]  is the break cut you off that's just the point alex it's when he's decided the kids are going to
[2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:59.520]  have to have chips i mean what has gone on with him we certainly don't support the palestinians with
[3:00:00.880 --> 3:00:08.160]  historically and at all we really don't but it's just very concerning what he's doing to his people
[3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:12.800]  and you know he's supposed to be taking care of the children stuff for the little children to come
[3:00:12.800 --> 3:00:17.920]  up to me he's putting them right to the front of the line to to go along with these globalists
[3:00:18.880 --> 3:00:22.480]  well notice as soon as they indicted that yahoo he certainly started
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:27.920]  going along with whatever uh the the last one is that interesting yes of course that you know it
[3:00:27.920 --> 3:00:33.360]  didn't take him any time to turn around and you know that that happens to all of them it's just
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:41.120]  like osha immediately they have taken down uh their notice that uh employers could be liable if they
[3:00:41.120 --> 3:00:46.880]  forced the people to wear a mask and take the vaccine now they're going to pull it what do they
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:53.680]  have on them everybody is turned in you know it's like i totally agree with you and i've been ashamed
[3:00:53.680 --> 3:00:57.920]  of governor abbot finally he said we'll give you a thousand dollar fine you make people wear a mask
[3:00:57.920 --> 3:01:03.120]  or try to make them take shots and so that's now finally texas is leading again i know oklahoma

[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:36.960]  out i call out that low life we have over here the daddy's boy that plays governor in new york
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:43.280]  here little andy qualmo and his brother christy qualmo two boys born on third base and thought
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:53.360]  they had a home run i just went off about four fraud fauci and i went off about i go off about
[3:24:53.360 --> 3:25:00.240]  that mario draugy the head of the bankster gang of the european central bank that's now the prime
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:06.480]  minister of italy because the two sellout parties chinquist stellar and the northern league brought
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:16.800]  them in so if their name was uh fauci or for qualmo berg or draugy steen you don't call me an

[3:25:45.040 --> 3:25:49.120]  and you read back to the trends journal for elections
[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:56.720]  that net yahu is a prime minister you gotta get the other parties to support you to get a majority
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:05.840]  so you can come in couldn't do it he's being brought up on criminal charges and as long as
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:12.880]  these prime ministers they can't bring them up on them i've been writing in the trends journal
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:24.000]  so when all else fails they take you to war and he sells himself as mr security
[3:26:27.200 --> 3:26:34.400]  the rockets didn't start going off from gaza until israel after they pushed them into this
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:39.120]  and you're not supposed to fight back and when these little bottle rockets and the united states

[3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:18.320]  again you look at the map 1948 of israel it was like that and now it's like that
[3:27:18.320 --> 3:27:23.600]  with all the land that they took and they call it settlements it's against the geneva convention
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:31.440]  the u n one after another they're breaking the law and going back to net yahu this guy's a
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:41.520]  power-hungry guy when all else fails they take you to war and they took him to war on that monday
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:49.360]  when it all began after a thousand troops went into the mosque shooting stun guns and rubber

[3:37:17.120 --> 3:37:23.520]  world i want to take some time and talk about the bottom line and the bottom line is this the
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:29.040]  biden bounces here just as we said what happened economy is going to go up it was weighed down
[3:37:29.040 --> 3:37:34.160]  of course it's going to go up it's not going to go back to where it was and it's going to get much
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:42.800]  worse that's all about inflation that's right you could be inflation numbers copper steel tin
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:50.400]  go up and down the line oh oil today oil only went up uh three percent heading back to that
[3:37:50.400 --> 3:37:56.640]  seventy dollar a barrel mark and it gives more tensions in the middle east and that thing hits
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:38:05.920]  eighty ninety dollars a barrel for crude we're for crude downtime because as inflation goes up
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:10.560]  besides that was standard of living going down
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:17.360]  the banksters the federal reserve that's not federal of course just the private bank
[3:38:17.920 --> 3:38:24.320]  they're going to raise interest rates and when interest rates go up this thing goes down
[3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:30.800]  down big time it's that cheap money they're pumping into the systems that allowed the
[3:38:30.800 --> 3:38:38.720]  bigs to get bigger that's right besides the drug deal is getting richer the billionaires
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:46.400]  got eight trillion dollars richer last year fighting the covid war the covid industrial complex
[3:38:46.400 --> 3:38:59.360]  got it that's all it is yep you see it inflation skyrocketing of course thirty six thousand
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:07.040]  dollars just in lumber to build an average house now more than it did before thirty six
[3:39:07.040 --> 3:39:14.480]  thousand dollars more just in lumber to build the average house so when inflation goes up this
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:21.760]  thing goes down and gold goes up and you saw gold take a spike when
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:31.680]  bitcoins and the other cryptos took a hit and as i've been writing in the trends journal and
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:40.880]  speaking now for a number of years remember you go back to june of 2020 in the trends journal
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:47.360]  now we said that when bitcoin broke over 10 000
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:54.960]  it was going to take a big spike upward and again
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:04.000]  but we've been writing all along that what's going to be fundamental with whether or not
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:09.920]  the cryptos go up is going to be government involvement you don't want competition
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:14.400]  they're like the drug lord they don't want competition
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:22.800]  go back to our trends journal they're going to go from dirty cash to digital trash and who's
[3:40:22.800 --> 3:40:29.360]  leading it china china is giving the people tens of millions of dollars in testing out
[3:40:30.560 --> 3:40:34.560]  digital currency so they know where you spent it how you spent it what you spent it on you think
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:44.320]  they know anything about us now they even know more the deep state there you go inflation
[3:40:46.720 --> 3:40:51.920]  so they're going to get into the digital business and they're not going to want competition
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:58.000]  that's what really brought the prices down besides musk saying Elon Musk saying you know
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:05.200]  you can't buy a tesla with bitcoin that the bigger thing is china prohibiting it
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:09.600]  and much of the bitcoin generation comes out of china besides
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:20.080]  so now you're hearing the federal government just today talking about speeding up going
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:30.560]  toward a digital coin so when they go digital you can't when you leave a tip for somebody
[3:41:30.560 --> 3:41:38.320]  it's a digital tip they get their percentage get this in your head everybody we got a criminal
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:43.840]  groups running and destroying our lives just like they suck the joy out of life with the
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:53.040]  COVID war these are sick people that are power hungry freaks they're going to go digital
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:42:00.080]  so they can get the money from us because they never work a day in their lives
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:09.200]  they get jobs as bureaucrats politicians
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:18.240]  you're in the system and they need money to keep their system going and all their friends in the
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:26.960]  gang so with a digital currency they know everything about you everything
[3:42:29.840 --> 3:42:33.680]  all well must be turning in his grave he couldn't have made this stuff up
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:42.320]  of course not look at that other low life murderous piece of garbage scum crap another little
[3:42:42.320 --> 3:42:48.800]  daddies boy born on third base and thought he had a home run a little jerk of a stupid arrogant
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:43:05.120]  nobody george bush yep took us to war the iraq war the afghan war boy did his popularity
[3:43:05.120 --> 3:43:12.480]  rating spike shows you how dumb the people are dumb enough to believe bush's wars dumb enough
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:20.960]  to believe the COVID war his popularity rating was going below 50 before 9 11 but
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:24.560]  afghan war shot up to 90s
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:30.000]  these are the people running and ruining our lives
[3:43:33.440 --> 3:43:35.840]  liars cowards freaks and fools
[3:43:35.840 --> 3:43:40.800]  fools little george bush
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:49.440]  one after another it's one big club and you ain't in it george callan said may he rest in peace
[3:43:49.440 --> 3:43:52.240]  i know his brother patrick good guy known well
[3:43:54.960 --> 3:43:56.080]  it's up here in woodstock
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:04.400]  so it's up to us to change the future and there's never been a better time than now
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:10.480]  ever never i've been at this 41 years been with presidents prime ministers and princes
[3:44:13.120 --> 3:44:15.600]  no princess but princes
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:23.920]  yeah prince and i know what the game looks like people are fed up
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:31.280]  it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on
[3:44:31.280 --> 3:44:35.760]  setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men's and samuel adams
[3:44:37.440 --> 3:44:44.720]  and now it's time to light that brush fire because if we don't it'll only get worse again
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:50.320]  there's going to be the biden bounce things are going to go up when interest rates go up
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:57.120]  everything's going down big time you better prepare prevail and prosper and you could do a lot of that
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:45:04.080]  with the what you get from info wars not only the information but also those survival products
