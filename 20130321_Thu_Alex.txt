[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.760 --> 00:33.600]  Alex Jones
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.880]  something really hit me this morning in the throes of my desperation to try to
[00:39.880 --> 00:45.440]  somehow unlock the minds of the general population to discover the fact that
[00:45.440 --> 00:51.360]  there is a war against reality a war against truth going on as I watched a
[00:51.360 --> 00:57.760]  video that is up at info wars dot-com that I do not recommend squeamish people
[00:57.760 --> 01:06.600]  view gruesome video shows Syrian rebel beheading civilian and it's al-qaeda
[01:06.600 --> 01:10.960]  with the al-qaeda announcements and I've seen many of these videos they throw
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.400]  Christians off roofs and blow up the churches and to know that the globalist
[01:15.400 --> 01:20.920]  that run our country are commanding and funding these people absolutely upsets
[01:20.920 --> 01:27.400]  me and I was thinking to myself how do I capture the public's attention because
[01:27.400 --> 01:30.920]  the establishment thinks that you're so disconnected from reality not even so
[01:30.920 --> 01:37.120]  much stupid but so tuned into his sitcoms and all the garbage
[01:37.120 --> 01:47.680]  that they can blame iraq for 9-11 with no proof get caught lying about it and
[01:47.680 --> 01:53.000]  then say saudi arabia or 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers came from is
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.560]  completely exempt from all of this in our ally
[01:56.560 --> 02:01.480]  I mean that shows how dumb they think we are and then now they've gone about
[02:01.480 --> 02:04.480]  let's not exaggerate
[02:04.480 --> 02:11.600]  a thousand steps further literally I mean just just so far beyond it is that
[02:11.600 --> 02:19.560]  absurdist garbage to hyper bizarro world where the government publicly for over
[02:19.560 --> 02:25.280]  two and a half almost three years runs al-qaeda and libya and syria funds them
[02:25.280 --> 02:33.160]  to engage in all sorts of horrible activities and the media then says we've
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.120]  got to invade syria because al-qaeda and just kind of leaves it out there
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.600]  so the public thinks will assad is al-qaeda while al-qaeda is attacking him
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.160]  and then I see some of the military comments you know the military sides are
[02:47.160 --> 02:51.160]  like yeah we sure we have the arabs killing each other we play both sides
[02:51.160 --> 02:55.680]  you don't play anything the new world order plays all sides and they run
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.080]  al-qaeda to take our liberties and you notice now they're announcing saudi
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.200]  arabians don't have to get patted down and all that and go and go right in the
[03:03.200 --> 03:07.080]  trusted traveler line but your wife they're going to look for george
[03:07.080 --> 03:11.120]  washington in our panties let me tell you they're not looking for bin laden
[03:11.120 --> 03:16.200]  you know in your underwear now they're looking for george washington they're
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.080]  looking for thomas jefferson they demonize the founding fathers they
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.320]  demonize gun owners christians returning veterans and where's the debate in the
[03:23.320 --> 03:27.160]  military where's the debate and talk radio where's the debate anywhere the
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.040]  cfr brags we need al-qaeda mohammed karzai comes out and says the west runs
[03:32.040 --> 03:36.920]  al-qaeda it's a fact and i want my constitution back i want my liberty back
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.240]  and i call the hoax of a bunch of foreign banks running this country and
[03:41.240 --> 03:46.120]  using their little attack dog al-qaeda to menace us so we let the government
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.880]  declare us terrorists they've already made the flip to saying al-qaeda is our
[03:49.880 --> 03:55.040]  buddy and gun owners are the terrorists and i told you it was coming and if you
[03:55.040 --> 03:59.920]  don't call these crooks it's over going along with these people is going to wreck

[09:33.440 --> 09:36.480]  and they're blocking the release of the toxicology reports we know he was on

[09:59.600 --> 10:03.760]  cops we learned arrested in combat gear hiding in the woods
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.440]  and first they said oh no no there was no one in the woods that's made up
[10:07.440 --> 10:12.240]  children said that when there's chopper video of it and we later got the names
[10:12.240 --> 10:17.520]  of an anti-terrorism task force federalized police from three counties
[10:17.520 --> 10:20.000]  over in the in the special response teams they

[10:28.640 --> 10:32.800]  and all of it and and bloomberg tweeting within three minutes
[10:32.800 --> 10:36.080]  and then we now admit he brags they were ready for the next event
[10:36.080 --> 10:42.000]  and you've got the salivating the salivating of michael moore

[11:03.280 --> 11:08.240]  changed the model of citizen journalism out there right now unless you
[11:08.240 --> 11:10.560]  look at info wars.com but it's definitely
[11:10.560 --> 11:17.440]  paramount there with what they're doing and expanding on all of this lindsey
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.960]  graham's like we can kill whoever we want president can kill whoever he wants he
[11:20.960 --> 11:24.160]  can kill citizens we're protecting america we're not the
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.000]  he says we're not the ss it's really weird we're not the ss we're
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.600]  moral and he's such an obvious degenerate little

[11:35.040 --> 11:41.040]  sweating oh yeah you're moral you work for foreign banks that are imploding
[11:41.040 --> 11:43.680]  prosperity and funding the destruction of the
[11:43.680 --> 11:47.440]  family and bioweapon attacks through vaccines
[11:47.440 --> 11:51.680]  the water of the gmo against everybody you're a little front man a little
[11:51.680 --> 11:55.200]  mercenary pimp you're not even a good one now look at
[11:55.200 --> 11:58.960]  these vessels of evil they're pathetic
[11:59.440 --> 12:02.800]  they're willfully turning themselves over to darkness
[12:02.800 --> 12:05.840]  and then i look at the video that's got me so angry today
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.520]  gruesome video and let's not show it for tv viewers if they choose
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.200]  to go watch it we're not going to show it if they people choose to go watch it
[12:13.200 --> 12:17.520]  and info wars.com you can and i mean i see so many of these that the enemy's
[12:17.520 --> 12:20.160]  winning against me i get to where i don't even look at new images of dead
[12:20.160 --> 12:22.240]  kids and new images of people having their
[12:22.240 --> 12:25.520]  heads chopped off in the celebrations as al-qaeda gets christians
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.680]  and others and throws them off roofs and shaws their heads off and
[12:29.680 --> 12:33.520]  everything else and just to know that nato and the globalist and that nato's
[12:33.520 --> 12:36.880]  the new world order army with the u.s military at the heart of it
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.080]  just putting al-qaeda in libya and syria and
[12:40.080 --> 12:46.720]  and and afghanistan and pakistan and using al-qaeda worldwide to overthrow
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.720]  countries and just wreck nations and then use them as the cut out fake
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.040]  threat the sock puppet to then take our liberties and then flip the whole thing
[12:57.040 --> 13:00.800]  and i saw this behind the scenes coming for 11 years now it's public
[13:00.800 --> 13:04.000]  and you think i'm happy being right about this you think it's fun to get up
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.840]  here because i have to be honorable and confront these globalists and call
[13:07.840 --> 13:09.760]  them murderers and expose what they're doing
[13:09.760 --> 13:13.440]  and call their house of cards and call their emperor's new clothes
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.680]  you think that's fun i guarantee you my life's in danger right now ladies and
[13:17.680 --> 13:21.280]  gentlemen and so why am i doing this because there is no future if we don't
[13:21.280 --> 13:26.400]  beat these people they are crazy they're introducing in the open ocean
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.560]  giant gmo salmon that major university studies show within just a few
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.960]  generations will extinct all ocean salmon they're four times bigger they've
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.280]  got all sorts of weird plant and insect genes in them
[13:39.280 --> 13:43.120]  okay i i mean the globalists say they're taking our rights for the environment to
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.680]  save the earth while they act like aliens from another planet hell-bent on
[13:47.680 --> 13:50.640]  destroying the earth i'm not saying they're aliens from other
[13:50.640 --> 13:54.640]  planet but i've analyzed these people these people are turned over to pure
[13:54.640 --> 13:58.400]  evil and they enjoy wrecking pretty things
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.720]  and they love acting like good guys selling everybody on how wonderful they
[14:02.720 --> 14:04.800]  are
[14:05.520 --> 14:09.600]  and again what we need is people out there that know about the dark side
[14:09.600 --> 14:13.600]  but who have a good side and who love god people that know evil
[14:13.600 --> 14:18.640]  to fight evil you see there's so many people that think evil is powerful who
[14:18.640 --> 14:21.040]  try to become evil they go and do evil things to
[14:21.040 --> 14:26.880]  become evil but really strong people have a knowledge of good and evil that's
[14:26.880 --> 14:29.440]  why we're falling but we understand really where it ends
[14:29.440 --> 14:34.560]  and how bad it is and recoil from it at the final step we get all the sexiness
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.880]  of it on its surface i know evil i can swim all through it and
[14:38.880 --> 14:40.880]  let me tell you something you stare into the abyss
[14:40.880 --> 14:44.560]  it doesn't change you change you dance with the devil you change
[14:44.560 --> 14:49.440]  i don't like this okay this is not fun
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.880]  makes me so sick i mean think of the the mind control think of the overthrow of
[14:56.880 --> 15:00.480]  reality think of the war on reality that they
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.080]  are openly destroying the environment butchering the genetic code of the
[15:04.080 --> 15:07.520]  planet killing plants and animals killing humans
[15:07.520 --> 15:11.440]  diseasing everything it's like a thousand times more evil
[15:11.440 --> 15:14.960]  than kim jong-un who's toddling around and you know they can't
[15:14.960 --> 15:17.280]  even get their automobiles to operate correctly
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.520]  because it's such statism but statism here got control of such a wealthy
[15:21.520 --> 15:25.680]  powerful dynamo and was able to build a black pyramid of
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.280]  satanic power that is weak compared to the universe
[15:29.280 --> 15:34.800]  and the creator of the universe the god of this creation

[24:16.480 --> 24:23.280]  no one knows what it's like to be hated
[24:23.280 --> 24:30.640]  to be faded to telling only lies
[24:30.640 --> 24:39.040]  but my dreams they aren't as empty as robert gibb's conscience
[24:39.040 --> 24:47.120]  seems to be what poets the who and i have confirmed
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.960]  from multiple sources they are multiple members our big time listeners
[24:50.960 --> 24:55.520]  the show i want to say hi to them speaking of rock legends philly
[24:55.520 --> 24:58.720]  corrigan i was in town i had time to hang out with him a couple
[24:58.720 --> 25:03.760]  days off and on for south by southwest um i went to an amazing birthday party
[25:03.760 --> 25:07.200]  uh with him and some of his old friends i'm not gonna tell that story it was
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.200]  just a dinner for about three hours but um learned a lot from some of the
[25:11.200 --> 25:14.560]  biggest record executives in history household names for people that don't
[25:14.560 --> 25:18.160]  even follow that i'm not name dropping it's just amazing to get to
[25:18.160 --> 25:21.280]  spend three hours with people like that last year he took me to a
[25:21.280 --> 25:25.040]  private uh facebook party that had their you know president and
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.440]  people like that at it but uh you learn quite a lot
[25:29.440 --> 25:32.560]  um but that's a side issue billy corrigan
[25:32.560 --> 25:35.760]  obviously the most powerful interview i've ever seen him do
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.600]  not not just with me but of course founder of smashing pumpkins
[25:39.600 --> 25:42.560]  which has always been very popular but has had a big resurgence
[25:42.560 --> 25:45.920]  of course one of his big claims to fame i think would be uh and hi billy want to
[25:45.920 --> 25:48.640]  say hi to you i think you're down in mexico right now playing mexico city
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.960]  uh claim to fame is jessica simpson's boyfriend tell you you got to envy that
[25:52.960 --> 25:56.480]  okay i'm being bad i apologize little gallows humor here with the news i was
[25:56.480 --> 26:00.560]  just covering um very powerful very deep interview
[26:00.560 --> 26:03.760]  it's about an hour long we're going to air 20 minutes of it
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.880]  today on the radio coming up at the start of the third hour
[26:08.880 --> 26:12.320]  ahead of john rapoport joining us and then i'm
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.520]  going to air the whole thing end to end tonight the first 20 minutes and then
[26:17.520 --> 26:20.240]  the other 35 or so that's 50 something minutes long
[26:20.240 --> 26:24.240]  we're going to air that tonight on the nightly news seven o'clock central
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.080]  if you're not a prison planet dot tv member become one
[26:28.080 --> 26:31.120]  but again all this worldliness and and billy is a
[26:31.120 --> 26:34.400]  not really a very worldly person in the world uh but
[26:34.400 --> 26:37.440]  but all of that you know the beauty of art
[26:37.440 --> 26:43.440]  the wondrousness of my children my wife getting to meet amazing minds
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.280]  not into celebrity for celebrity's sake i like to know interesting people
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.440]  all of that pales and falls by the wayside when we don't have a future
[26:51.440 --> 26:54.480]  because we've allowed the very worst people
[26:54.480 --> 27:01.360]  in our culture and in our society to take control
[27:01.360 --> 27:08.880]  we have turned our culture and our society over to
[27:08.880 --> 27:12.880]  fraudsters to con men who are using in their own manuals they
[27:12.880 --> 27:16.560]  write books bragging are using psych warfare to create an
[27:16.560 --> 27:19.920]  alice in wonderland reality and then they look at people like
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.760]  myself who's trying to really nail down the closest reality because
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.720]  none of us are perfect we all see through rose-colored glasses
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.000]  we all distort things but i'm trying to really take the blue pill
[27:33.040 --> 27:35.760]  you're like what do you mean you're gonna take the blue pill well because
[27:35.760 --> 27:39.280]  the matrix is the red pill you're like what does
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.960]  that mean the point is everything is backwards
[27:42.960 --> 27:46.400]  with these people it's the blue pill that really wakes you up
[27:46.400 --> 27:51.200]  it's the red pill that keeps you in the matrix i know that in the movie
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.680]  i know in the film it's the red pill you could say it's the red pill and it does
[27:55.680 --> 27:58.880]  wake you up in that movie
[28:00.320 --> 28:03.920]  and again i just threw that out to be confusing because i'm trying
[28:03.920 --> 28:07.280]  to figure out how to get people out of their trance
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.800]  how to get people to go wait that doesn't make sense you understand what
[28:10.800 --> 28:15.760]  i'm saying what i just said didn't make sense and
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.480]  the government's saying we're going to take your rights
[28:18.480 --> 28:23.280]  because of al-qaeda while they publicly run them
[28:23.280 --> 28:27.440]  you have to take the blue pill to want to live in
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.280]  their alice and wonderland to buy into that
[28:31.280 --> 28:34.720]  and so i am really saying take the red pill
[28:34.720 --> 28:41.600]  but you see how we're in such a false reality with them that they just
[28:41.600 --> 28:45.120]  throw out whatever they want and then hope that people buy into the
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.000]  line and i hope what i just said isn't too
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.680]  confusing or too sophisticated and i don't mean that in a condescending way
[28:51.680 --> 28:55.200]  i'm simply trying to get people to think that things might not be
[28:55.200 --> 28:58.960]  what they're automatically told they are
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.560]  and i am going to make
[29:03.600 --> 29:10.400]  a pretty big announcement at the bottom of the next hour after
[29:10.400 --> 29:13.760]  greg palace leaves us getting into the whole financial meltdown by design and
[29:13.760 --> 29:17.840]  the mega banks that he's tracked like no one else out there for 20 years he was
[29:17.840 --> 29:21.360]  a former federal fraud investigator i mean of course predicting they would

[33:28.960 --> 33:36.080]  remember all i'm offering is the truth nothing more
[33:36.080 --> 33:43.040]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[33:43.040 --> 33:50.880]  alex jones show
[33:50.880 --> 33:54.800]  you know the fact that this radio show is growing by leaps and bounds and its
[33:54.800 --> 33:59.360]  popularity is a very positive point but i also realize i have a great
[33:59.360 --> 34:05.440]  responsibility as someone who's real to try to really do the best job i can
[34:05.440 --> 34:08.880]  but at the same time none of us can over analyze ourselves
[34:08.880 --> 34:12.240]  and then get so obsessed with being perfect that we don't engage in the
[34:12.240 --> 34:15.920]  fight against tyrants the most important thing to do is to
[34:15.920 --> 34:20.400]  want reality and to want the truth above all things
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.240]  and to then confront those that are selling lies
[34:24.240 --> 34:28.240]  because you could talk about it red pill blue pill but yes the establishment to
[34:28.240 --> 34:32.240]  use the matrix analogy they want us to take the blue pill and
[34:32.240 --> 34:35.520]  stay in the matrix
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.680]  okay which is physically real in their world the machine world but in
[34:41.680 --> 34:44.800]  our minds when they jack into our brains
[34:44.800 --> 34:47.840]  but if you look at it from the modern perspective
[34:47.840 --> 34:51.760]  they always talk about patriots are going to take you down the rabbit hole
[34:51.760 --> 34:55.840]  no again i want to climb out of alice in wonderland
[34:55.840 --> 34:59.280]  up to the surface and find out what the real reality is
[34:59.280 --> 35:03.200]  and to use that uh plato's allegory of the cave
[35:03.200 --> 35:06.560]  george lucas's first film with robert deval that's excellent
[35:06.560 --> 35:13.360]  thx 1138 that's the name of the drugged brainwashed subloid creature
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.400]  under the control of a scientific technocracy
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.880]  in underground labyrinth cities of the future that are actually the plan
[35:20.880 --> 35:25.040]  of aldis huxley who was only writing about the plan
[35:25.040 --> 35:28.720]  of the globalist and who admitted in speeches and in brave new world
[35:28.720 --> 35:31.920]  revisited that this is an actual plan that the
[35:31.920 --> 35:35.280]  british aristocracy and technological military
[35:35.280 --> 35:38.880]  industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about planned
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.240]  to build so that's how i know what they're going
[35:42.240 --> 35:44.560]  to do because they've told us what they're
[35:44.560 --> 35:46.720]  going to do and that's what's frustrating about it
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.040]  it's like we're in an underground city that has glass walls and a glass roof
[35:51.040 --> 35:53.440]  above it and we can see the sun and moon and a
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.280]  mountain range off in the distance and we can even see wild humans that are
[35:57.280 --> 36:01.760]  more free in other countries compared to us and they're telling us no
[36:01.760 --> 36:06.320]  you don't see that out there we're not underground told this is our whole world
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.760]  we're not chained up looking at a projection string
[36:09.760 --> 36:16.400]  uh stream on a wall we are here able to see the fraud able
[36:16.400 --> 36:18.880]  to see the lies able to pick up the books
[36:18.880 --> 36:23.920]  written 100 years ago 70 years ago 30 years ago 10 years ago a year ago
[36:23.920 --> 36:27.520]  admitting it's a false reality admitting they're lying to us
[36:27.520 --> 36:31.280]  admitting they've bought off the media admitting they're breaking up the family
[36:31.280 --> 36:34.320]  admitting they want a post-industrial world for you and i
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.760]  but not for them admitting they believe they're going to merge with machines
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.200]  and live forever but before they can do that they've got to kill us
[36:41.200 --> 36:45.040]  in some survival of the fittest mega battle i mean this is a
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.920]  stinking nightmare and they're building it
[36:49.920 --> 36:52.720]  people say why don't you talk about google glasses more they're so hot now
[36:52.720 --> 36:56.160]  this has actually captured people's imagination they're actually concerned
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.200]  because i talked about google glasses 10 years ago
[36:59.200 --> 37:02.160]  the globalists the transhumanists that are really the eugenicists have said
[37:02.160 --> 37:05.280]  this is going to empower humanity but the problem is they've built back doors
[37:05.280 --> 37:07.280]  into it in the architecture to make sure it
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.520]  enslaves us and then they they falsely cast those of us that are
[37:11.520 --> 37:16.080]  against this as anti-technology when it's the opposite they are
[37:16.080 --> 37:18.880]  building a technology that's deployed to us
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.400]  that we're allowed to use that's run by darpa
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.840]  by mit and their front google and their front apple
[37:25.840 --> 37:29.920]  which are fronts on record just like microsoft you can go research
[37:29.920 --> 37:32.720]  right now we've written articles we've had guests on
[37:32.720 --> 37:37.120]  cia technology analyst like steel and others
[37:37.120 --> 37:39.920]  he got threats over it wouldn't come back on after it happened now it's
[37:39.920 --> 37:43.120]  mainstream news he was on like eight years ago
[37:43.120 --> 37:47.360]  it's on record microsoft is an ibm defense department front
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.000]  because they had to get around antitrust laws back when it was still somewhat of
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.400]  a congress they like to have the illusion of groups
[37:52.400 --> 37:56.560]  it's a on record apple's a government front steve jobs all that a total
[37:56.560 --> 37:59.760]  fiction sure they're top futurists for the globalist they were
[37:59.760 --> 38:03.680]  actually running a lot of things but they didn't they didn't create it
[38:03.680 --> 38:12.080]  all these myths ibm microsoft google they're all in q tell and other cia
[38:12.080 --> 38:17.120]  darpa subsidiary run i mean go look it up it's hiding in plain view
[38:17.120 --> 38:20.320]  it's hiding in plain view they put cancer viruses in your vaccines
[38:20.320 --> 38:23.600]  i mean you want your kids to die you want to die have you looked at the
[38:23.600 --> 38:25.600]  cancer numbers i know i talk about this all day
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.920]  they're killing us but it's so over the top most people don't even know
[38:31.920 --> 38:36.640]  what to say or what to do okay well get mad get focused understand
[38:36.640 --> 38:41.600]  what's going on start speaking out even if you stand there in front of
[38:41.600 --> 38:44.320]  your mirror saying i'm going to do something i'm going to stand up i'm
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.400]  going to be a leader that's the beginning of doing it in the real world
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.000]  i'm committed to this 110 percent and again i'm going to explain this to you
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.040]  there are things worse than physical death there are things worse than an
[38:55.040 --> 38:59.200]  individual dying as a man i was born to build a
[38:59.200 --> 39:02.960]  civilization for my family and a future for them with your family
[39:02.960 --> 39:06.400]  you were born to build a civilization as a man or a woman
[39:06.400 --> 39:09.440]  you were built to build a family and a culture
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.360]  of true equity and genuineness and true renaissance you were built to
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.840]  design and create in the image of your creator and so not
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.760]  following god's programming is what i fear
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.640]  and not because i am some goody two-shoes person
[39:28.640 --> 39:36.080]  but because i understand the real path and that is what creates the prosperity
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.120]  the problem is future generations come that do not have to
[39:41.120 --> 39:44.880]  fight for anything and so they become jellyfish and begin to
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.560]  attack and create false systems of thought to ridicule
[39:48.560 --> 39:52.720]  and debase those that are warning them because they see it as like their mom
[39:52.720 --> 39:55.840]  telling them take out the garbage and they think mom
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.520]  or dad is telling them that to be mean to them not because mom and dad don't
[39:59.520 --> 40:03.680]  want you to be lazy fools spoiled rotten children is what we've
[40:03.680 --> 40:07.040]  all become to one extent or another prosperity
[40:07.040 --> 40:09.760]  makes monsters
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.120]  adversity makes men
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.440]  and so we're here where the government publicly runs al-qaeda
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.880]  and every day or two there's a new video with them murdering christians blowing
[40:24.880 --> 40:27.280]  up churches murdering muslim minority groups
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.840]  like alawites blowing up police stations killing families
[40:31.840 --> 40:39.440]  making father's suicide bomb or they kill their family
[40:39.440 --> 40:43.600]  and and our media goes asad claims he didn't suicide bomb his government
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.520]  building that dirty asads with al-qaeda they
[40:47.520 --> 40:51.120]  actually have it in the paper and then the new york times runs video
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.240]  of look at these freedom fighters making somebody suicide bomb or they
[40:54.240 --> 40:57.440]  kill his family and then people got upset so they pulled the video down
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.680]  but see that was a psych warfare test can we show them
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.280]  making a guy drive a truck to blow up a police checkpoint
[41:05.280 --> 41:11.440]  uh or or they kill their family can we show that
[41:13.520 --> 41:16.640]  can we show that
[41:19.520 --> 41:23.840]  and then have no one care i i mean they are assaulting your morals folks
[41:23.840 --> 41:26.960]  you don't have morals because they've sold it like you're some goody
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.080]  two-shoe that doesn't want you know to have a party with the cheerleaders you
[41:30.080 --> 41:32.480]  know the devils how much a hot cheerleaders with
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.640]  horns going come on baby let's party don't let that square keep you from it
[41:39.360 --> 41:45.520]  the devil is piles of dead children folks with maggots crawling all over
[41:47.040 --> 41:50.080]  and i just don't want to go down that road and we're going down that road
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.360]  we're turning loose and empowering the worst minds the worst craven hearts
[41:55.360 --> 41:58.800]  who don't want control just for simple power there's been a lot of elites like
[41:58.800 --> 42:00.880]  that sometimes they actually build up
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.000]  powerful societies but it always gets taken over by some bad person
[42:10.560 --> 42:15.040]  i just want to survive and if they can sell us on al-qaeda openly working for
[42:15.040 --> 42:17.760]  the globalist and then because it doesn't fit the
[42:17.760 --> 42:21.360]  script we were already given we don't make a big issue out of it if
[42:21.360 --> 42:27.280]  they can sell us on that they can sell us on anything
[42:27.280 --> 42:31.440]  it's just that simple
[42:32.880 --> 42:39.440]  and society is already collapsing but they just paper it over with propaganda
[42:39.440 --> 42:42.400]  so that it becomes the norm and then if you point out we're going in the wrong
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.240]  direction they just go conspiracy theorist
[42:44.240 --> 42:47.440]  they now say if you have a political view like i think google glasses
[42:47.440 --> 42:51.200]  with them saying you're an agent of google in the nsa i mean they're saying
[42:51.200 --> 42:54.240]  new technology will make us agents of google
[42:54.240 --> 42:57.920]  director of the big brother watch says the implications of privacy are
[42:57.920 --> 43:01.920]  profoundly worrying london telegraph
[43:02.800 --> 43:05.920]  and then they come out and say you're a conspiracy theorist everyone's going to
[43:05.920 --> 43:08.160]  have glasses with their phone and everything on it
[43:08.160 --> 43:10.560]  they'll just stop manufacturing the regular phones
[43:10.560 --> 43:13.920]  if you want it you'll have to get it all the stars are
[43:13.920 --> 43:17.120]  already you know getting them and oh it's so sexy we've got to do it
[43:17.120 --> 43:20.240]  everybody goes out and gets it and then it's oh now you're getting a chip in
[43:20.240 --> 43:23.680]  your head to access everything sorry if you don't
[43:23.680 --> 43:25.680]  want to you just won't have access to anything
[43:25.680 --> 43:29.280]  be able to have a job and that's what ray curves well in the
[43:29.280 --> 43:33.360]  un say you will take the brain ship you're going to take it that's in the
[43:33.360 --> 43:37.360]  official un documents and then 15 years ago i'm like read
[43:37.360 --> 43:40.160]  these un documents you know read this uh forward to a book
[43:40.160 --> 43:43.760]  written by uh nute genrich the globalist calling for
[43:43.760 --> 43:45.920]  world government all of us to have brain chips
[43:45.920 --> 43:49.760]  to control everyone and and it'll create a utopia sounds like a nightmare because
[43:49.760 --> 43:56.640]  it's run by these people don't you get it if god put a brain chip
[43:56.640 --> 43:58.960]  in us it wouldn't be a problem but the devil
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.280]  wants to put a brain chip in you the people running the machine are bad
[44:03.280 --> 44:06.480]  the people running the google glasses are bad
[44:06.480 --> 44:09.440]  i mean i'll be honest with you google glasses once they're perfected will be a
[44:09.440 --> 44:12.640]  great tool for us with the police or government people or to infiltrate
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.640]  things the problem is it's jacked into skydent
[44:16.640 --> 44:20.240]  it's a little robot you put on your head spying on everything
[44:20.240 --> 44:23.600]  and it's not you recording it to your device or to the
[44:23.600 --> 44:29.760]  you know memory device in the uh in the clasp that go on the side of your head
[44:29.760 --> 44:33.760]  it's jacked into sauron it's a two-way crystal ball
[44:33.760 --> 44:38.800]  it's two-way jacked into the new world order
[44:39.040 --> 44:42.160]  i'm all for better glasses coming out that have hidden cameras in them we've
[44:42.160 --> 44:45.280]  got some that's great that's the individual
[44:45.280 --> 44:49.040]  in power this isn't this is a crystal ball and that's their own words that
[44:49.040 --> 44:53.680]  sees two ways what does gandalf say to sauron you're
[44:53.680 --> 44:57.520]  not supposed to have a crystal ball like this we don't know who else is watching
[44:57.520 --> 45:03.760]  sauron or saruman why should we be afraid to use it
[45:03.760 --> 45:07.280]  and see that's the lie i mean we're about to be given the apple
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.520]  the true knowledge of good and evil i mean the world is about to just
[45:11.520 --> 45:15.840]  hyper accelerate towards the singularity and and unbelievable things are going to
[45:15.840 --> 45:17.680]  happen and then we should have a debate about
[45:17.680 --> 45:19.760]  what's happening but instead of a commoner
[45:19.760 --> 45:22.640]  has any debate about this it says hey this is run by bad people this
[45:22.640 --> 45:27.920]  architecture is not designed organically people like shut up conspiracy theorists
[45:27.920 --> 45:31.840]  there's nothing to fear there's nothing to fear you better know
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.760]  you've been warned about the vaccines the hydrofluorosolic fluoride water
[45:35.760 --> 45:40.160]  you've been warned about gmo you've been warned a hundred percent it's designed
[45:40.160 --> 45:42.960]  to slowly kill you and then absorb you into a medical
[45:42.960 --> 45:46.640]  system it's nationalized they have to have it nationalized to to
[45:46.640 --> 45:49.280]  to have the death actuaries and the death panels
[45:49.280 --> 45:52.640]  to kill you and normalize it and the vaccine damage fund
[45:52.640 --> 45:56.800]  with the millions of damaged kids per country all nations have these now that
[45:56.800 --> 46:00.080]  are under globalist control to just normalize and standardize our
[46:00.080 --> 46:02.560]  extermination to where it's going to get where
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.160]  half your block's dying of cancer and there's mass burials going on
[46:06.160 --> 46:10.080]  and and there'll be no discussion of why it's happening
[46:10.080 --> 46:13.040]  just like there's hardly any discussion of why have we gone from one in twenty
[46:13.040 --> 46:15.040]  five thousand with autism to one in fifty eight
[46:15.040 --> 46:19.760]  in thirty years just like there's no discussion of why is pediatric cancer up
[46:19.760 --> 46:22.640]  over ten thousand percent since the 1960s just like there's no
[46:22.640 --> 46:25.680]  discussion of why is breast cancer up several thousand percentage points it's
[46:25.680 --> 46:28.080]  all about find a cure not why is everybody getting
[46:28.080 --> 46:33.360]  it now we're being killed by a bunch of nuts
[46:33.360 --> 46:37.120]  who obsessively keep themselves you know away from all this stuff
[46:37.120 --> 46:40.720]  and while they drink purified water and have uh cures and treatments for
[46:40.720 --> 46:43.040]  themselves and then they say sure there's some
[46:43.040 --> 46:46.880]  blowback it's hurting top technocrats but they don't care because killing you
[46:46.880 --> 46:51.360]  for their god is so much more important
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.160]  and it tears my guts out because it it's just i mean i look at my
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.800]  five-year-old daughter who is the image of innocence and goodness and and just
[47:00.800 --> 47:06.560]  you can really see god's handiwork there not just in a sunset not just in a
[47:06.560 --> 47:09.200]  moonrise not just in the ocean not just a little
[47:09.200 --> 47:12.400]  fish in a pond looking down and flowers and the smell
[47:12.400 --> 47:14.880]  and everything and all the things god gives us
[47:14.880 --> 47:18.400]  men and women in our relationships and futures and
[47:18.400 --> 47:22.240]  everything and creativity all of it that's beautiful and the system likes
[47:22.240 --> 47:24.960]  ugliness can i get that through your head the
[47:24.960 --> 47:27.680]  system wants to take all that and wreck it and it is
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.680]  everything the globalists actually do if you take the red pill and get outside
[47:31.680 --> 47:35.760]  the matrix is wreck things while telling you as you see the wreckage
[47:35.760 --> 47:38.720]  oh give us more power we'll fix it and then you give them more power and
[47:38.720 --> 47:42.640]  they move the wrecking forward faster
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.640]  and i am not just content to sit here and be a talk show host and fight these
[47:50.640 --> 47:54.000]  people i am not content to just play it safe and
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.840]  only go at half speed against these people
[47:55.840 --> 48:02.560]  and not get killed i am going to go full power and i am asking god to
[48:02.560 --> 48:05.600]  to give me the discernment and to beam me
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.000]  the information to really absolutely throw myself 110
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.080]  i ask god to throw me 100 against the enemy
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.240]  i don't whatever the consequences are i do not want this to continue
[48:18.240 --> 48:22.480]  and again it's not because i'm a hero it's because i know there's no way out
[48:22.480 --> 48:26.960]  but to do that to throw ourselves 100 against
[48:26.960 --> 48:32.960]  the new world order and all of its rotten stinking works
[48:33.280 --> 48:38.960]  now the question is before you what are you going to do you have got to break
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.360]  the matrix you have got to focus in that we they're
[48:43.360 --> 48:45.680]  trying to put us into an alice in wonderland thing
[48:45.680 --> 48:48.960]  what did carl rove said he said we control reality and we'll tell you
[48:48.960 --> 48:52.640]  something ridiculous tomorrow but you will report it like it's real
[48:52.640 --> 48:56.720]  and the press then so they have access so they get the press releases
[48:56.720 --> 48:59.840]  first and so they get to go to these little meetings they will do
[48:59.840 --> 49:03.360]  anything to get that access but now notice the globalists don't even need to
[49:03.360 --> 49:06.960]  give you access now they're saying we may just stop
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.720]  having press conferences all together there may just be a virtual president
[49:10.720 --> 49:14.160]  you may never see the president again see they're purposefully
[49:14.160 --> 49:17.920]  blurring the lines between three-dimensional reality and their
[49:17.920 --> 49:21.600]  false digital reality and then through peer
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.080]  pressure and ridicule giggle and laugh at people as we phase
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.320]  into a false reality they're going to more and more say join
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.400]  the false reality and be given perks of the machine if you
[49:34.400 --> 49:36.720]  don't join the false reality you are going
[49:36.720 --> 49:41.520]  to be listed as a terrorist and yet but they have to put you in the false
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.560]  reality because they have a plan they've just been testing it so far
[49:46.560 --> 49:49.120]  they'd probably be at 12 billion people if it wasn't for their programs the un
[49:49.120 --> 49:51.520]  estimates so it's only seven and a half billion it's going to crested about eight
[49:51.520 --> 49:54.240]  and a half billion and then they plan a mass exterminism
[49:54.240 --> 49:57.440]  down to 500 million is what most numbers show
[49:57.440 --> 50:00.880]  some public numbers are a billion 100 million they kind of tell their own
[50:00.880 --> 50:03.760]  minions that because they don't want to do the math figure out they're dead next
[50:03.760 --> 50:06.960]  but once they get people drugged enough and and and and
[50:06.960 --> 50:10.400]  once they've got the police doing what they say and following crazy orders
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.160]  they're then going to release viruses that are actually
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.000]  RNA constructed nanotech this has all been announced that are going to hit
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.320]  everybody but i believe that you know this is
[50:20.320 --> 50:23.680]  spiritual i believe the spirit is going to override it
[50:23.680 --> 50:26.720]  and and there's evidence to some they've already tested this and a lot a lot of
[50:26.720 --> 50:28.560]  people are immune because they don't want to have it too
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.640]  strong they're testing it viruses that give you select lobotomies
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.480]  of the spirit connected centers where your brain plugs into the spirit
[50:36.480 --> 50:40.320]  they want to attack the the the the the soul seat
[50:40.320 --> 50:43.600]  the pineal gland that's what the fluoride is about and and you're going
[50:43.600 --> 50:47.200]  to see mass zombieism and so they're now but
[50:47.200 --> 50:50.400]  not real undead just just lobotomized
[50:50.400 --> 50:52.640]  people and that's why they're creating a race
[50:52.640 --> 50:56.560]  memory in humans now to accept the zombie collapse
[50:56.560 --> 51:01.360]  they're first going to release the viral attack before the mass extermination
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.120]  if you're listening you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day
[51:05.120 --> 51:08.400]  if you're listening you know the economy is not getting better

[54:07.440 --> 54:12.720]  she's all alone all alone in a time of need
[54:12.720 --> 54:16.160]  because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course

[54:23.040 --> 54:30.200]  yeah ladies and gentlemen
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.960]  we are on the edge of this already entering it
[54:41.960 --> 54:46.680]  entering the new world order and these are the times that will make
[54:46.680 --> 54:50.680]  and break humanity the true danger is to the species and
[54:50.680 --> 54:57.800]  the society and that our our species remains somewhat intact into the future
[54:57.800 --> 55:01.240]  the ultimate act of vandalism by the globalist
[55:01.240 --> 55:07.080]  seeking after their father's work is to destroy the species irrevocably
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.640]  itself to genetically mutate it twist it and
[55:11.640 --> 55:15.400]  turn it into an abomination
[55:15.400 --> 55:21.000]  and that is the goal whether you believe in god or not the globalists are the
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.680]  devil all traits described in the bible all
[55:24.680 --> 55:27.240]  traits that i have experienced of the enemy
[55:27.240 --> 55:30.520]  it is real whether you believe in a spiritual entity or not
[55:30.520 --> 55:35.400]  it is manifesting it is manifesting you could use the
[55:35.400 --> 55:39.080]  fantastic planet analogy of they don't understand the big machine they found on
[55:39.080 --> 55:41.480]  the planet but but it's being run by the subconscious
[55:41.480 --> 55:47.000]  mind of dr morpheus what whatever you want to say we've seen
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.600]  this before and now it's not just going to do what nero did
[55:50.600 --> 55:55.320]  it's going to have high-tech systems to play god
[55:55.320 --> 56:03.000]  and this god is the god of this world this god is not a god at all
[56:05.560 --> 56:10.520]  by the way drugsreport.com has linked to our story big sis refuses to answer
[56:10.520 --> 56:13.880]  congress on bullet purchases there was another congressman who said he's asked
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.360]  her about it and not got a response now another congressman uh we are
[56:18.360 --> 56:20.920]  changed and we're going to play this later
[56:20.920 --> 56:24.920]  dhs stays mum as members probe for explanations
[56:24.920 --> 56:30.600]  so now we've learned that there's at least two congressmen
[56:32.280 --> 56:37.000]  who have tried to get answers on this this is congressman timothy
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.120]  huel's camp i believe you pronounce it i'm gonna try to get him on
[56:40.120 --> 56:43.560]  revealed this week the department of homeland security has refused to answer
[56:43.560 --> 56:45.400]  questions from multiple members of congress
[56:45.400 --> 56:48.520]  regarding its recent purchase of huge amounts of
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.560]  weapons and ammunition
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.560]  and he goes on to say they have refused to answer that and a host of other
[56:55.560 --> 56:59.400]  questions well yeah they wouldn't let them see pdd51
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.960]  which the summary says makes the president a dictator
[57:05.080 --> 57:07.800]  we are changed also talked to senator gramm and he said look we can kill
[57:07.800 --> 57:11.240]  whoever we want we're not the ss and talk about a
[57:11.240 --> 57:12.760]  headline that's another article right there
[57:12.760 --> 57:18.680]  senator gramm we're not the ss we're very moral
[57:20.520 --> 57:23.240]  i saw those videos yesterday and sent them over to the watson that's why
[57:23.240 --> 57:28.040]  there's reports coming out on it uh and my point in bringing that up is
[57:28.040 --> 57:31.800]  is is that i'm just describing how they blew me away

[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.840]  to just shut the grid down it's the internet kill switch it's the
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.040]  cashless society kill switch that they admit they've been developing and that's
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.880]  all this is jp morgan chase is the government of
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.400]  this country it is the new world order it is the financial corporate heart
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.920]  of these interlocking combines
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.160]  and they are anti-free market they want a global monopoly and a
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.080]  dumbed down population living as serfs in giant government-run
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.520]  surveilled ghettos where they live in lavish
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.560]  mini cities in the most beautiful areas in the world
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.560]  uh protected by uh robot drones and sentries
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.080]  just go rebert rig herswell writes and he just says look it doesn't matter the
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.560]  singularity we'll just step on you like you're a bug
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.160]  you know will we get rid of humanity you're bugs it won't even be a
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.280]  discussion that's what they all say you're you're
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.000]  already bugs we're merging with the mega computer
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.240]  we're merging with hal 9000 dave i'm afraid dave and what's crazy
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.640]  about the globalist is they're in control through through all their
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.920]  scamming and scheming but they're always messing up they just
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.960]  keep doing the same plan when first you don't succeed try try
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.920]  again and so people are like well you know if they don't always get what they
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.480]  want and usually end up failing well what's the problem well
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.640]  they'll end up destroying us in the process they must be stopped
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.560]  because the most radical of them the most out of control of them
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.200]  end up getting in the power positions as they shove the others down
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.040]  because what does british special forces say
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.960]  it's an old saying came before them but it's their creed their credo their
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.720]  maxim their signet their battle cry
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:10.680]  fortune favors the bold fortune favors the bold and i agree
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.880]  it's true fortune does favor the bull and i'll make a bold announcement and
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.520]  point out the emperor's butt nakedness in t-minus 25 minutes
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.280]  the government's got all my phones tapped they already know what it is
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.920]  the government the mafia that uses my tax money to build this big monstrosity
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.040]  so they can perch up there and wear black ties and
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.000]  white shirts and walk around imagining their secret
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.640]  agents following some false mind control template of their importance you're
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.440]  important when you join humanity you're important when you break the
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.240]  chains of control you're important when you come out of the matrix
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.600]  you're important when you fight for your family and humanity

[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.920]  culled and you know it you weren't given the memo but justice
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.480]  says you'll be given a warning and i'm here to give you the warning
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.960]  it's dictated that you be given a warning it's metaphysical

[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.280]  continue to operate

[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.040]  going to expose that the emperor is absolutely naked
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.240]  i'm going to call the giant hoax so stay with us for that i really
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.320]  appreciate greg palace who's worked for abc news bbc you name
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.320]  it syndicated columnist joining us he also writes for the
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.240]  observer one of the biggest newspapers in europe
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.600]  greg palace.com is his site he's a best-selling author
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.480]  i wanted to get him on because he explained in 2002 when the documents
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.880]  leaked that there's a plan to implode europe and the u.s
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.200]  with the hedge funds next and sign us onto their derivatives debt
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.480]  and he decried the derivatives moves in the late 1990s as well
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.640]  bipartisanly he was a former federal fraud investigation
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.600]  uh specialist at the highest levels of these brokerage firms and big banks
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.280]  so he saw it coming he's the first guy other than economist
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.800]  george humphrey my friend here in austin city council member at the time
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.320]  who also broke it down but greg palace got the documents
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.120]  what they've done to the third world they plan to do here what they've done
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  to greece they're gonna do to every other country in europe
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.880]  and then us whatever they can get away with they'll do
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.480]  uh and now they said they want ten percent of the cyprus banks money
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.400]  and now they're saying 15 in italy and 15 in spain
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.680]  to set the precedent to just steal your money right off the top
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:49.560]  unelected e-bureaucrats so i wanted to get him on uh here today
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.200]  they put an arrest warrant out a few years ago for when he was covering the
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.920]  fema uh trailer areas in louisiana falling
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.280]  apart they said it was terrorism to film a government installation the
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.000]  arrest warrant was issued it got media coverage
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  and so they didn't arrest him but it got dropped but it shows the mindset
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.360]  of this system where we can't hand out magazines now in austin
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:10.840]  until i went down there and threatened to sue they said you can't hand your
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.960]  magazines out anywhere in the downtown you can't have info worse bumper
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.760]  stickers it shows what the higher-ups want
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.560]  and if we lay down they're going to win the the fake instinct to grovel and lick
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.120]  boots is going to bring us to hell now greg palace to greg palace dot com i
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.880]  want to get your take on exactly what's happening where this is moving

[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:44.920]  especially because when i wrote in in vice magazine a giant uh
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:51.400]  international column uh space that i have that the alex jones show is one of
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:57.160]  the most intelligent most informative uh platforms for real journalism in the
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.160]  united states a lot of my lefty friends are like what are you talking about alex

[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.680]  because they're scared anybody who's starting to really have an effect like
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.080]  yourself or others they will attack that person in the press and say don't
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.360]  go near this person because they're afraid our ideas are going to be picked
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.400]  up in fact i just have to take a couple seconds to mention that obviously i am
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.560]  the mainstream outside the united states bbc the biggest uh english language
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.400]  television let's talk about piers morgan briefly yeah because and what happened

[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.280]  get arrested go ahead uh well as soon as he steps back in england this is
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.760]  amazing to me and i have to say thank bless you sir for getting in his face
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:04.360]  piers morgan um as a bbc television reporter and as a reporter for the
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.720]  guardian the biggest uh english language paper in the nation much bigger than
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.120]  than the new york times uh i did an undercover investigation in which i found
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:17.000]  that there was a lockup between tony blair the clinton white house big power
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.240]  companies to basically seize the utility assets of the planet and i uncovered
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.320]  this including enron got inside did undercover reporting
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.600]  splashed all over almost brought down the blair government people want the
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.280]  prison but piers morgan who was running a filth
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.480]  rag called the mirror uh went after me calling me a liar coming
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.080]  up smearing me he puts you on the cover and listen you never toot your horn you
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.720]  more than anybody helped bring down enron god bless you
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.880]  who is raping the californians what some leaks with of over a billion dollars of
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.520]  extra charges that's right and what i always hated is
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.720]  that while we got enron i thought that it wasn't a bad apple with the whole
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.640]  damn rotten tree branch and so what happened was that
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.960]  piers morgan even went so far as to as you know i was on the cover as a sex
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.400]  maniac of the of the uh mirror just making up
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.320]  this stuff about greg you know hey listen i don't mind a little action but
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.400]  you know they i was smeared left and right uh by piers
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.920]  morgan a complete liar and then the sex maniac's better than a
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.200]  hacker hacking innocent people you know uh
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.960]  maniac maybe uh but the uh but the thing is i we all
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:30.680]  uncovered that piers morgan had done insider trading stuff that in the united
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.560]  states you'd be breaking rocks on a chain game
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.600]  he he would trade on stocks listen to this
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:41.400]  this guy would trade piers morgan would as the editor of paper find out what his
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.680]  columnists were going to recommend in the business pages the next day
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.120]  or next week to buy he would buy it in advance
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.480]  knowing that the stock would be pumped and would go up was automatic
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.800]  he was pocketing hundreds of thousands of pounds into his own pocket
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.200]  you know in the u.s i mean it'd be that's absolute
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.560]  jail time i've never heard of anyone doing that in the u.s jail time he let
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.800]  him get away with it he lied on his visas the u.s state
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:11.400]  department including the current obama administration
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.760]  allowed him to come into the united states despite the fact that it says
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.920]  that uh if you've committed what would be a
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.720]  felony crime in the united states which he committed
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.640]  you committed a felony crime in the united states uh then uh
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.560]  you uh you can't get a visa to work here you can't get a green card doesn't he
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:32.600]  fit the perfect mo of probably mi5 or mi6
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.680]  worse because he uses their information in other words he got a lot of
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.800]  so he's a guy above it he's one of like the master gophers
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.080]  who's actually playing the agencies but i mean when i met him i was like
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.840]  whoa this is this is the real deal right here i mean this is
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.520]  this is like count dracula by the way i do know that he really doesn't like you
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.480]  alex i got the insight but really what did
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.560]  they say but not well they i'll tell you later but they they're really not happy
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:00.040]  with any with either of us but the thing is they're really upset
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.640]  with me because i'm from his establishment from bbc
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.560]  and the other thing he did was he fabricated reports
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.400]  on the war in iraq he literally took fabricated photos and
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.520]  he got caught supposedly photos of soldiers in iraq they were taken in in
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.520]  sunny england and he faked these photos
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.800]  and when he got caught he said well they were kind of like the real thing can you
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.800]  imagine faking war photos i gotta hear them and i
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.520]  know they hate me they were crying and freaking out you know they say they beat
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  me in the debate it was actually blew up in their face
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.040]  they're scared but but before we get into cypress but i mean i i mean this
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.600]  hatchet man thing is important what from your sources is morgan saying
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.320]  okay he's just really upset with you i mean he's reading everything we're
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.480]  saying about him hi piers i'm sure he's monitoring
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.360]  and you know he's tried so hard to set me up to ruin my career to say you know
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.920]  i'm a sex maniac and hey listen here's my phone number if anyone
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.640]  wants to help me get over this uh this terrible affliction uh but
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.920]  uh but the thing is is that you know what he's a
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.200]  you know by u.s law he's a criminal felon i can't
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.000]  by english law he seems to have gotten away with it they don't have the same
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.760]  securities laws we have he fabricated news reports most people
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:20.760]  would never be allowed on the air and for cnn or or to allow
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.920]  a guy who's been caught again and again literally making up the news
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.760]  making it up faking it and using it to enrich
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:34.760]  line his own pocket um i'm just stunned at the you know i i once said that when
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:39.400]  american mainstream media needs a new uh tv host
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.960]  new news anchor they just wait for a toilet to overflow and they got him
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.960]  you know and it's just unbelievable is that the best america could find
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.960]  is this guy who if he goes back to england will be immediately clamped in
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.080]  irons by the way because he was involved in wiretapping phones
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.920]  that's all against well they've already arrested what is it like 10 people it
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:04.520]  was five more last week his underlings you know all the people
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.280]  around him all the people around him and he even
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.800]  admits that he heard he listened in on private phone conversations because they
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.920]  hacked into people's answering machine including
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.040]  sir paul mccartney i know exactly how he did it i'm not gonna i can't
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.560]  reveal but i know exactly the method he used um
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.920]  from my bbc television show our investigators know exactly how he how
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.560]  you did it piers i know exactly and we will reveal that as soon as you get
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.200]  close enough to your to sunny england to be arrested
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.000]  then we'll reveal it we know how you did it he's listening it's creepy
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.840]  you know it's creepy it's illegal by the way it's quite illegal i
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.360]  you know he jumped whenever i found out he was at a big gun place in houston
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.320]  they told me so i so they let me into the green room
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.200]  and i walked up and he actually jumped when he saw me it was really funny
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.720]  you know these guys you know it's and so it's it's unfortunately
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.920]  unfortunately suddenly he's clothing himself as guy protecting our little
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.960]  children from getting shot in schools police this guy is he's a threat to the
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.720]  moral character oh yeah that's like the bushes prescott bush after he got caught
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.600]  running the nazi banks they created the uso
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.560]  right as he was about to be arrested with all the others but they did that so
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.760]  they said well we can't arrest him he just started this thing for the troops
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.800]  yeah so look it's it's fun in circus and what's terrible about it is that
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.760]  somehow they say alex jones is is a wild man and yet piers morgan who's who does
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.080]  nothing but the britney's he says his dream
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.400]  his dream interview would be britney spears excuse me i want to vomit but
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.080]  anyway i don't mind you want to interview britney spears fine mr morgan
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.760]  just do it from the prison cell that's waiting for you in london and it's
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.360]  getting a lot closer i mean how can all his underlings go to jail and admit
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.080]  they've been doing this but he doesn't get in trouble
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.200]  yes i mean the english system is so class poisoned
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.880]  and plus don't forget alex remember i said he lined his pockets with
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.480]  from inside information i want to know mr morgan

[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.760]  first of all people should know that if you don't know greg palace
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:37.400]  i am a reporter for bbc television but before i became a journalist i was an
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.000]  investigator justice department and racketeering fraud expert
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.840]  but i actually got my degree in economics studying under milton
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.280]  freeman at the university of chicago of all things so you went to
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.080]  school around the real elite of this whole system
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.840]  i was i was the only american in what is known as the chicago boys group i was in
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.680]  with these uh i studied under six nobel prize winners
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.840]  and i and one of them by the way is a guy named bob mondell
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:07.160]  he is known as the father of the euro he invented the Europa now the
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.080]  the euro as they as he originally called it the euro was not
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.760]  was not invented by europeans it was not meant to be a competitive
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:20.760]  uh currency to the uh to the dollar what it was meant instead was to be
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.520]  something which would and let me tell you i'm quoting mondell
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:28.040]  i'm quoting the father of the euro he's on record he said it was to take over
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.160]  countries it was it was meant to eliminate the
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:36.840]  power of elected congresses and parliaments to regulate uh industry
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.280]  it would smash uh you know it would smash the uh
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.880]  the powerful unions it would end any type of
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.960]  of environmental regulation and it now appoints the presidents of major
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.160]  countries and exempts itself from the laws it is a
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.560]  tyranny so what he said was is look we have to
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.800]  take and he told me this i have by the way even
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.160]  tape recorded some of our conversations uh that's what he used to do i was
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.240]  always undercover even then as a young guy
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.600]  he said look we have to take away the power of parliaments
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.840]  to set fiscal policy to set monetary policy
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:14.760]  if we do that and we impose this regime then there is no vote of any parliament
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:21.160]  that can have any effect whatsoever on controlling industry and therefore
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:25.640]  the only thing you can do is reduce wages cut regulations
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.400]  and and and i don't mean regulations like you know that that regulator
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.120]  civil liberties he's talking about cutting regulations that and here's the
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.920]  issue they sell it like the corporations would create
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.040]  a utopia but the truth is they just shut down their competition
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.320]  they they are the opposite of free market while blaming the
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.600]  now the free market's being blamed for their piratical looting
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.520]  right so it's piracy and so what's happening is in cyprus
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:52.360]  is and is that uh you have a bunch of
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.880]  billions and billions of dollars in russian mobster money and looted money
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.720]  bribery money hot money has gone out of russia and put
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.240]  into cyprus which was made part of the eurozone
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.720]  this money then became is basically just a money laundering island
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:11.320]  the money went from cyprus out into greece and other places by
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.600]  so the mobster money can make it then jump over to
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.200]  switzerland let me guess so now the top gangsters know they're smaller gangsters
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.000]  there as well this is just don carlioni demanding a
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.160]  cut right off the top and while he's at it
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:26.680]  take everything from maids and people and school teachers
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.360]  so what happened is is that the the the cypriot banks
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.880]  the little elite that was handling the hot russian
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:40.520]  um dirty money of course got their skim and they gambled it all away in greece
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.320]  and then uh bigger sharks uh
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:46.600]  particularly a guy named paul singer we need to know who these guys are they're
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.000]  not just sharks in general they have names
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.680]  paul singer multi-billionaire romney's biggest backer by the way and his
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:54.520]  business partner romney's business partner
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.640]  has a fund called elliot management elliot management went to greece and
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.520]  said we're going to burn this country down
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.440]  unless you pay us 100 times i want to repeat that 100 times
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.640]  that we paid for the greek for greek bonds the greek
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.320]  government paid still had to steal it from the cypriot
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.960]  bankers now the cypriot bankers are busted
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.040]  they're about to go under so the european union

[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.480]  it like it is and uh i briefly want to ask him before
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:07.640]  he gets back into cyprus and all the rest of it
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.920]  hugo chavez i know you've met him interviewed him knowing i get the fact
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.960]  that that as strongmen go he wasn't like you know
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.440]  super nasty like fidel castro or something
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.360]  i get compared to a hitler he was he was an angel and i know being close to
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.520]  somebody you know when the devil's got his arm
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:25.480]  around you you know you you don't recognize it's the devil to quote albert
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:29.000]  spear you know the german armaments minister but
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.360]  uh i understand the globalists are horrible and evil and and are much more
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.400]  sophisticated but i know people from there who you know
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.280]  the communist basically he says he wasn't a communist i say he was a
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.400]  socialist taking property you know taking small
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.160]  family businesses i mean obviously he had a dark side too uh
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.280]  your eulogy or or or your statement on hugo chavez briefly
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.640]  okay i knew hugo chavez very well for more than decade we
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.520]  we met many times um and you know i but on the other hand i had a lot of
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.480]  disagreements with him and i got in his face quite a bit
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.320]  uh one thing i don't like to do is become friends with any politician
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.320]  because uh that's dangerous stuff i'm not brian williams
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.680]  having dinner with the president that makes me vomit
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.200]  so i'm not gonna do that with chavez but what you have to understand what chavez
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:20.600]  he was an elected leader unlike castro who is who's you know a dictator who
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.160]  rules purely by the gun and uh that's you know
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.840]  chavez was elected but chavez is cozying up to him was
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.360]  i mean i think that's what i mean i mean i wasn't the thing is is that
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.040]  the important thing is that he stood up against the new global order
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.400]  he said you're not going to take our oil for nothing
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.680]  he's not going to give away the oil to the coke brothers for nothing by the way
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.800]  the coke brothers are his main customers at the flint hills refinery
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.920]  in houston uh outside corpus chris christie
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.000]  he wasn't going to give the coke brothers free oil he wasn't going to
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.400]  give away all the money that comes down for oil that used to go to miami that
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.080]  was skimmed by the rich so he basically said
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.680]  he was robin hood he was robin like fdr he said
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.960]  i'm going to take from the rich who've run this country forever and i'm going
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.600]  to give it to the poor they've never gotten the oil money now
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:16.120]  they'll get it when i went to caracas in 1976 the first oil boom
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.160]  poor people a million people lived in cardboard shacks
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.600]  those cardboard shacks don't aren't there anymore chavas replaced it with
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.000]  bricks and mortars and buildings education health care
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.320]  you know um so you could say when it comes to redistribution which has always
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.280]  been a disaster he is one of the only cases where it
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.840]  wasn't an absolute nightmare he was the case where he first of all he
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.360]  didn't do it with guns and they don't have guantanamo they don't
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.280]  have bradley manning in prison none of that stuff no no i hear you i
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:49.800]  just don't say he's a good guy because we're run by bad
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.000]  guys i don't you know i don't just automatically say go ahead the big thing
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.200]  about chavez and by the way for alex jones listeners uh my bbc film
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.720]  the assassination of hugo chavez i am offering for free if you go to
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:08.040]  greg palace.com you can download it for nothing
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.840]  because i want people to at least get the other side of the story and meet
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:13.240]  chavez and by the way i meet with the guys who kidnapped him
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.240]  he was kidnapped in 2002 by the head of the chamber of commerce
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.760]  talk about a corporate takeover and the u.s ambassador
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:24.040]  ran down to have his picture taken with the kidnappers while they're holding
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.240]  elected president hostage you know how that looked to the rest of latin america
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.440]  listen promise me this then when you come back next week
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.600]  we'll do a whole hour on on your perspective on hugo chavez
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.480]  i would love to and it could be with your commercials i find them informative
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:40.760]  alex i don't mind your commercials oh especially the squatty potty but
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.120]  the point is the point is the point is is that i want to get you on the news
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.920]  about the financial stuff i'm gonna get you on the radio back
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:50.120]  about chavez because i want to really explore from somebody who
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.160]  actually was down there how many times you go to venezuela
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.800]  oh at least i have to i mean i've been down to latin america several dozen
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.480]  times i met not only with the president of
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.680]  venezuela chavez but with the presidents of ecuador brazil
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:04.520]  uh you know all of them that's my job but i also with the people who kidnapped
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.040]  them i mean with the people who take we're
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.920]  gonna have you back on about that in the three minutes we've got left for four
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:12.520]  minutes shift back to on record the the the private
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:16.280]  bureaucracy with the bank heads meets with the Cypriot leaders in cyprus
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.880]  and they tell them this is how it's going to be
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.200]  ten percent out of everybody's bank account to set a new incredible
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.000]  precedent even the head of the former head of the x checker said this will
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.560]  blow up europe but i guess they want to blow it up to
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:32.040]  then consolidate it again this is the shop doctrine yes um and
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:35.320]  what happened was christine legard who's head of the imf
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.400]  panicked she said we're going to have an international bank run
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.080]  if you do that why can't you take a few dollars from the bank owners they're the
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:46.760]  ones that that took all the hot money blew it away don't
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.720]  they and she said at least make them lose a
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.920]  few percentage uh points of their stock in these banks
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.880]  and they said no the ecb the german said no way because who is really behind
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.000]  these cypriot guys it's the germans who own the bank stock
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.800]  so he said we're not taking up any loss guys we're taking right out of the
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.840]  accounts she said you can't and they said you can't take it out of the
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:11.080]  accounts of of the pensions of working people
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:14.440]  and they said yeah after taking that she said make it 30 percent
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.480]  on on the russians and the rich the ultra rich
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:20.680]  and and you know two percent nothing on anyone over on uh
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.520]  with a small account they wouldn't do it and there's a reason
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:28.040]  they want the explosion when i talk to the former chief
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.720]  economist of the world bank he and i both lectured in economics at
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.240]  london school of economics and he said we called them the imf
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.360]  riots they want the riots because if there's a riot
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.600]  they can then call in the troops impose martial law and then name the so-called
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:48.440]  technocrat from you know goldman sachs or jp morgan
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.120]  who will run the country says the riot is written into the plan i want to
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:55.080]  repeat that phrase the riot is written into the plan and
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.680]  that's your article that's in my book from 2002 you've been breaking it down
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.320]  before that i mean this is part of their plan this
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:06.280]  all got leaked they do the same plan over and over again you know i showed
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.600]  the documents to stiglitz i want to make it
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:11.080]  very clear he never gave me the confidential documents
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.840]  he only verified them i said my god it looks like they're actually saying
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.600]  we want a riot so you can move in and and impose this
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.960]  these regimes he said that's exactly right that it's part of the deal it's
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.400]  the imf riot it's written right into the plan the riot
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.680]  and so then they could then the repression follows the riot so here's my
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.000]  question and then uh the stocks go down they
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.200]  can buy everything everything falls apart for six months then they come in
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.400]  and pose as the saviors bringing in total austerity
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.640]  and by the way one thing i did see also in if you go to great palace.com and
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.880]  you get the cyprus greek cyprus is surrounded
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.680]  surrounded by massive pools of oil and natural gas which have been virtually
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.880]  untouched that's what they want they're going to
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.920]  get that that's going to be that's going to be the final payment
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.920]  what are the russians going to do with their area they control cyprus
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:08.360]  well what uh the there's the northern greek park so what happened is actually
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.720]  to play them off the the president the prime minister cyprus just flew to
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:15.240]  moscow to basically offer the russians the big
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:20.200]  oil fields offshore as a way to try to maybe counter the the
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.840]  europeans but he know they've lost it's going to
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.080]  go to the russians or it's going to go to the germans
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.320]  or it's going to go to so it's just like the beginning of world war ii or or a
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:33.800]  few years into it whenever you've got uh hitler and and the uh russians
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.680]  dividing poland they're just they're carving up
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.880]  cyprus i mean this is incredible what about the precedent to just come into
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:46.600]  bank accounts and scoop money out well this is this is incredible
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.600]  that you just literally because remember the european union also has just like we
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.320]  have in the federal reserve you have a guaranteed bank account right we have a
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.440]  250 000 they had a hundred thousand euro uh
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.040]  absolute guarantee and the guys are supposed to guarantee the sanctity of
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.680]  your account are the guys who actually took the
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.080]  money can you imagine they just go and say
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:09.640]  10 percent joke and these are not the people that did this
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:12.760]  the bankers and the bankers didn't lose a penny
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:17.640]  the money was given to them and so in a way we do it in a more sophisticated
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:21.880]  manner that is bernanke uh crushes down interest that you
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.080]  receive to zero you get a quarter of one percent in your
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.720]  bank accounts you get next to nothing in your bank accounts
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:32.680]  the money is lent to the banks at a quarter percent by the federal reserve
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.360]  and then the federal reserve borrows it back as treasury bills at three percent
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.760]  well they literally handed out trillions of dollars at a quarter percent borrowed
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.160]  it back at three percent well that's a nice deal let me in on
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:48.920]  that why can't i get that deal so we do it here but in a much more
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.840]  subtle manner there i think they wanted to put it in people's faces
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:58.200]  they wanted to say they wanted to push that riot they want to kick the system
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.000]  over they call it uh the guys i worked with
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.840]  at chicago came up with this system uh there was a professor their
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.720]  philosopher named joseph schumpeter and he believed in what they called
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.160]  creative destruction it's kind of apocalyptic in other words if you bring
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.240]  the whole order down you can recreate a brand new fresh
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:20.600]  right if you're in control of a multinational thing above it you implode
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.960]  the subunits order out of chaos listen that is the
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.920]  shock doctrine which you of course have exposed for so long
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:31.400]  let's set you back up next week on the chavez situation for an hour
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.800]  to really delve into that and then let's get you on the nightly news i'm gonna
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.200]  let you talk to my uh producers here in just a moment or
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.920]  should i have one of the producers call you
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:44.040]  i have anyone call me and greg palace.com g-r-e-g-p-a-l-a-s-t
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.520]  for at least a week i'm going to keep up and while you're having me on talking
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.960]  about chavez you can download that bbc film uh for no
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.760]  charge thank you greg all right uh
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.040]  thank you sir i will talk to him again soon very important information very
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.040]  interesting perspective uh on uh all of this and i'll debate him
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.360]  a little bit in a friendly way about chavez next week because
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.280]  he started out uh just nationalizing the oil
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.920]  and i can go well that's that's that's pretty dangerous if you know what it
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.720]  leads to next but okay i don't care about the globalist
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.920]  you take the oil and he did divvy it up he built the power of the state did give
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920]  some money to some peasants gave him some land
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.680]  and like 14 years ago i'm like well that's actually positive a communist
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.560]  actually redistributing something because they usually don't do that
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.880]  because they want total control they actually make things poorer
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:32.360]  kind of agenda 21 but i still said i don't endorse it it's going to go bad
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.480]  and it got down to taking people's little shoe factories that might make
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.480]  you know 10,000 pairs of shoes a year some
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:41.000]  little bitty you know factory with 20 employees
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.520]  nationalize that give it to the communists kick everybody out take small
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.680]  schools over i mean that's on record so see
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.400]  it doesn't work is the point it got to where he was having to take everything
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.600]  he was redistributing wealth of people that would be considered poor in this
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:57.560]  country and it just made a giant mass of poor
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:02.920]  people that were a little bit better off than they were 20 years ago but but
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:06.120]  there's more of them just being no middle class really a tiny government
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.440]  elite and a few insiders that are opulently
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.600]  rich and no middle class and just a giant group of poor people
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.440]  who on average did get better for him that's why he can't really be voted out
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.320]  it's just it's just in but it was starting to get bad though
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:24.600]  back to where it was if you've studied this started really rotting
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.600]  because they'd already redistributed everything and everybody was just
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.000]  sitting around now i've got a lot of thoughts about
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.200]  what i'm about to say here and i just want to reset for a moment
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:40.680]  uh let's um let's put up on screen the article right now
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:43.880]  all right ladies and gentlemen i said that i had a big
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:47.400]  announcement here on the radio show today
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:56.120]  and it's this obama is now the head globally of al-qaeda
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.760]  and that's not a headline that we put up there
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.920]  that's any form an exaggeration if you have to say one man
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:10.440]  commands the forces of nato commands us forces to aid al-qaeda and libya and
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:14.680]  syria to engage incredible atrocities it is
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:22.360]  barack obama it is a absolute total
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:28.840]  and complete fact that that is going on and no one will call it like it is but
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.200]  if listeners of this show will take this article i'm gonna explain
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:36.120]  this in a moment that's up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:39.960]  obama now global head of al-qaeda and if you will send it out to everyone you
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:43.160]  know on twitter and facebook and youtube and your and
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.960]  other radio shows we can force a national debate about this
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:51.000]  just like we've done on the two billion bullets and the armored vehicles and the
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.320]  checkpoints and the preparations for martial law
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:57.560]  now with multiple members of congress calling for this investigation starting
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:01.560]  we can force this out there but we've already to a certain extent
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.160]  made the la times new york times and others admit okay the west is running
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:09.720]  al-qaeda is that a good idea well my issue is i don't believe in
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:13.400]  lesser of two evils put al-qaeda in to take out asad when asad hasn't attacked
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.960]  anybody and it's about 15 20 times better than
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:19.080]  al-qaeda i don't say i like him but compared because i don't like any
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.880]  dictator but he's not attacking anybody and he's not in the past been oppressing
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:26.280]  his people anything like what the globalists are
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:30.040]  going to put in so they put al-qaeda in and then act like i mean this is like
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:33.240]  the emperor's new clothes he's wearing no clothes but none of us
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:37.640]  are supposed to admit that he's naked and so we all just play along with it so
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.800]  what i'm doing is with a shocking headline that actually
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:45.640]  reports to the level of the over the topness
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:49.400]  and it can capture people's imagination because if you just have it in the back
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:52.840]  of the paper okay the u.s is hating these groups including al-qaeda and so
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:57.000]  is saudi arabia and so's nato and so's france but it's no big deal you know
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.840]  asad's bad guy we force the debate with the sensational
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.280]  headline because this is sensational see so many
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:07.800]  people tend to when the government does something sensationally bad
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:14.760]  over the top bad they will not cover it
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.200]  they or they will just bury it or they will whitewash it because well you
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.720]  can't say the government runs al-qaeda when they do
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.400]  and now muhammad karzai their own puppet has come out and said
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.240]  the united states and nato run al-qaeda and taliban they're staging the bombings
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:33.400]  remember that two weeks ago that really pushed us out there and
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.560]  really had a lot of people start apologizing to me
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.920]  well it's not just that one point it's thousands and i'm going to go over
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.400]  some of them here but here's the rest of the headline and this is what's
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.040]  newsworthy this is what is different it'll get
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.720]  people thinking because it shows the absurdity of what they're doing
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.120]  this is not an absurd statement in reality because what obama and his
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:57.400]  controllers are doing is so absurd here's the headline obama now global
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.400]  head of al-qaeda sub headline will president order drone
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:05.000]  strike on white house will the president order a drone strike
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.600]  on himself now if this breaks big we'll try to spin it that i'm saying drone
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.360]  strike that's how dumb they think you are
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:14.200]  i want nothing to happen to obama i want to live to be 150
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.480]  in a prison cell along with the rest of globalist i don't want to turn him into
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.720]  a martyr he's just a teleprompter reading puppet
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:23.320]  but in his puppet office of an authoritarian
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.880]  uh a white house now that's admitted saying natos over our military
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.000]  you know he'll shut down power plants without congressional approval he's
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.880]  becoming dictatorial he ran fast and furious to blame the
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:38.360]  second amendment you've now got obama saying he'll kill
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.960]  and he'll drone strike anybody he wants anywhere anytime
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.640]  including u.s citizens including domestically and that he's
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.400]  above the law and he'll order you tortured
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.880]  he'll order you drugged for trial whatever he's god
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.360]  while in the real world they put over 50 000 al-qaeda in libya and now in syria
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:59.960]  and we have video today of them chopping innocent people's heads off blowing up
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:04.040]  christian churches and engaging in unbelievable war crimes
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:07.640]  while everyone's told we're losing our rights because of al-qaeda
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:11.240]  but now they're segwaying you notice saying actually
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:14.280]  it is veterans and gun owners and conservatives of the new number one
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:17.000]  threat just departments reporting we're going
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.480]  to go after them with homeland security so so i'm calling the 10 million pound
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:25.240]  elephant in the room i'm calling the emperor obama is butt naked
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:29.240]  i'm calling it out and i'm saying according to your doctrine
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:32.360]  that you can just say somebody's al-qaeda and kill them
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  if you really wanted to get al-qaeda president obama
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:39.480]  you would shut down al-qaeda operations that you run
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.680]  so if you had a computer picking targets for it you said get al-qaeda
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.800]  like goldeneye what would that computer target
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:51.320]  it would target you so you are the head of al-qaeda obama is the head of al-qaeda
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:54.840]  i mean it's true call it people are like what's the big news that is the big news
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:57.960]  calling it for what it is the matrix taking the red pill
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:01.640]  the white house runs al-qaeda they are al-qaeda
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:05.400]  if you're listening you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:09.560]  if you're listening you know the economy is not getting better you know gas and

[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:19.160]  next hour then john rapoport with now they're going to start drugging you with
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.360]  mind control drugs to make you tell the truth in trial
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:25.000]  that's just public torture that's a public fake trial
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.840]  but they're hiding it in plain view using appeal to authority
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:33.320]  to act like it's okay oh yeah we injected black people with syphilis we're not
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.480]  going to get in trouble yeah we just gave you know hundreds of
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:38.120]  thousands of people polio like you know stuff and
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:41.560]  uh debilitated 40 plus thousand of them in india but it's no big deal back of
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:44.840]  the paper see they want to just create a normalcy
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:48.520]  bias where you just get used to incredibly bad things being normal
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:52.520]  if government does it that's how the journey of tyranny happens
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:55.480]  and so you read the article that paul watson and i put together this morning
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.960]  that just went up at info wars dot com obama now head of al-qaeda will
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.000]  president order drone strikes on white house i'm getting
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.640]  my movie names wrong i said uh the the name of the film where you know
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:10.280]  people can't control their own subconscious is uh
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:14.680]  a forbidden planet and it's eagle eye where the computer
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:17.640]  sees that the government's destroying the bill of rights and constitution with
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:21.320]  drone strikes and attacks the government so we ask the
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.200]  question and i'm asking it and again i want no arm on the president
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:27.960]  they'll try to twist that and say that and and that'll just help get the story
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:30.360]  out even more because you're a bunch of liars if you say that
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:34.920]  secret service has been here before uh multiple times so whatever we're saying
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:38.680]  according to obama saying kill anybody involved with al-qaeda
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.880]  will he order a drone strike on the white house or on himself
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:46.120]  or on nato headquarters because they run al-qaeda and taliban
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:49.560]  and kar's eyes pointing it out and i've got stacks of articles linked
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.720]  uh in this uh mainstream news admitting it and the council on foreign relations
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:56.120]  saying we need al-qaeda they're doing a great
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.600]  job said that last year that's the real government here in the u.s
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.680]  so by having a shocking headline only a shocking headline can
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.120]  can can can point out the shocking absurdity
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.720]  of the globalists running al-qaeda all over the world and then
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.880]  saying oh well we just play both sides no you don't you ran 9 11
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.240]  you ran oklahoma city you ran fast and furious you ran it all
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.280]  then they go oh you're saying our troops did no the criminal
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.640]  globalist that have infiltrated the government that's who i'm talking about
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.880]  let's get that straight that's the inside job does that not mean there
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.960]  aren't some muslim extremists yeah there are
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.280]  and the globalists use them to take down countries and take my liberties
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:38.760]  and i am sick and tired of it now let me go over this here obama
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.960]  now global head of al-qaeda will president order drone strike on the
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:45.160]  white house and i asked that question member gibbs
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.280]  said oh we were told to lie and say there was no drone program
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.720]  even though it was admitted to exist this is the same deal
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.720]  they run al-qaeda publicly and they're trying to get us
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.000]  to sit here and play along with it so i'm not playing along
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.040]  okay that's why we're in so much trouble folks they have gone so far
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:07.880]  no one wants to admit this it came out recently in williamson county that they
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:10.200]  knowingly kept an innocent man in jail who had no
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.000]  criminal record for 25 years you know they had the bloody
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.760]  bandana and and and and and you know had somebody else who'd done a murder and
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.120]  tried to keep him in jail you're like how did that happen because
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:24.360]  once they knew they'd set him up they could never admit it and it's the
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.320]  same thing once they get you once that's the michael
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.600]  morton's case once they get you into evil you have to
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.400]  keep defending it so now they've got us defending
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:38.280]  the government running al-qaeda while saying they've got to take our rights
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.520]  because of al-qaeda and i told you this was coming
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.960]  now saying oh it's not al-qaeda it's patriots we're the new al-qaeda
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:47.480]  no i'm not you're terrorists you're al-qaeda you're a foreign banking

[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:59.320]  alive okay so that's what's happening that's

[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:28.600]  area with jakari jackson melissa melt and david knight we're all back there
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.320]  and i said what do you think of what i just did they uh and david i looked up
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:35.160]  and he said you just outed obama and that's it i mean they're hiding in
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:39.560]  plain view it's like catching a guy in bed with your wife i mean just boom
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:42.680]  a whole deal right there they're like nothing happened nothing happened they're
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:47.080]  running al-qaeda in front of us so i'm saying hey mohammed karzai is
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:50.120]  calling them out everybody is just call them out you're al-qaeda it's a bunch
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:53.960]  of foreign banks run our government they're staging stuff to get our guns
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:57.720]  and and and you're not people groveling to them is not going to get us out of
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:02.280]  this just calling it like it is i don't want my children or your children
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.840]  having a hellish future i care about the future i care about the continuum
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:10.520]  we have all this wealth because our ancestors did care about the continuum
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:14.200]  that is the most that's a key trait of civilization is that you're not just
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:19.000]  thinking about today and you're not ego driven you're not peacock driven
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.680]  it's okay to like some nice things and fast cars or whatever
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:26.840]  for its enjoyment and its security but it's not to worship
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:31.240]  see there will be no idols before me what does that mean an idol you worship
[02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:34.600]  it god's got to be number one doesn't mean
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.720]  you don't like other things in your life doesn't mean you don't like some status
[02:01:37.720 --> 02:01:41.080]  or whatever as you get closer to god you won't care about that anymore
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:45.720]  the point is is that you will start turning loose to the things of the flesh
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.480]  and i'm telling you it's fulfilling to the point of i will call them out even
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:53.080]  if they kill me and i'm not stupid folks i i accelerate
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:56.520]  into territory very dangerous because they know i know how to call
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:01.800]  them out because i'm i am primitive now let's go to lindsey graham walking
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.920]  around like a sweating degenerate when we are change
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:08.840]  questioning and going we hung nazis we can hang whoever we want in america
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.440]  the idea is though you're the nazis he goes we're not the ss
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.800]  we're moral the ss thought they were moral
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:18.760]  they have the diaries of the ss how much they hated shooting little kids in the
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:21.640]  head and stuff but it was the right thing to do here let's go ahead and go
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:24.760]  to this tape senator graham what do you think obama
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:28.440]  should be judged jury and executioner with his deposition matrix
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:32.840]  oh i i couldn't have i believe that enemy combatants
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.600]  american citizens can be enemy combatants what about orohi malawaki the
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:39.000]  16 year old innocent american citizens that
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.280]  i don't know what the facts were but you do get collateral damage
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:48.440]  i'm a big the person who determines enemy combatant status is not a court
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.960]  it's the commander in chief it's one person
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.840]  send it right this way shouldn't it be more than one person that gets to decide
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.080]  who lives and dies we're at war and the commander in chief
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:07.160]  one person sends our soldiers into battle we don't have a committee of
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:10.680]  congress what about when it's america just listen i don't she's now domestic
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:13.640]  citizen not under the law of war that doesn't matter they say you're a
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:17.000]  terrorist you're dead you wear uniforms so you know that punk
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.600]  you run al-qaeda american citizens recruited by al-qaeda they're looking
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:24.360]  you're on al-qaeda they're here already you're right yeah we know you're one of
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:27.560]  them joins out that's al-qaeda right there on peril
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.160]  they're here already they'll have a hearing about whether or not you're a
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:33.240]  member of the organization yeah they're dining at the pentagon
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.480]  we have one stage his orders our troops into battle and we're all lucky person
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:39.800]  has the authority to determine who the enemy is
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.880]  because we're at war thank you they dump out al-qaeda anywhere they want
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.400]  you said you take your rights but also at that time
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:50.360]  they got tried with the nearburn trial and they use the same excuse that we're
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.680]  at war and we can do whatever we like well i
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:56.920]  see that's the point i'm trying to make if someone were ordered to kill an
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:01.400]  innocent american where there's no evidence that they have committed
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.200]  you know they're involved in terrorism is the disposition matrix enough please
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.960]  the the uh person carrying out the order
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:14.120]  could be prosecuted in the military you don't have the nuremberg defense that
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.960]  i'm carrying out orders so really the men and women who pull the
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:23.800]  trigger on drones and who drop bombs i know them i know the pains they go
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:28.680]  through to prevent collateral damage i really
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:35.320]  we're not the ss we're a very ethical military the the thought that goes into
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:40.360]  targeting people oh yeah you run al-qaeda publicly obama is the head of
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:43.400]  al-qaeda but the difference you are a lieutenant

[02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:17.400]  well a year ago he visited us in this very same studio and it's one of the
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:20.360]  most popular interviews we've ever done with viewers
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:23.880]  of info wars nightly news and everybody on the radio showed out in youtube world
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:27.720]  with more than 30 million records sold he is one of the
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:31.560]  biggest rock stars in history he founded the smashing pumpkins
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:34.760]  which i've been a big fan of for years since high school really or i guess
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:38.840]  college but the real reason i'm a fan is he is an
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:42.760]  amazing thinker and gets me to think as dumb as i am that's that's hard to
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:45.880]  do billy corrigan of smashing pumpkins uh
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:48.920]  here in town to play in austin texas with sold out
[02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:51.240]  crowd good to have you here my friend thank you alex
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:54.840]  what we're seeing right now is a turf war right
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:09:01.560]  a turf war between uh old republicans you know uh the rush limbaugh they call
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:04.600]  the old white men crowd you know as they're struggling for
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:10.120]  definition in a rapidly changing america then you have you know the the coming
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:14.520]  immigrant classes which way they're gonna go um you know
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.400]  social liberals who are willing now willing to look the other way
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:20.760]  why we're doing you know these terrible things around the world with drone i'm
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:24.120]  suddenly now those things aren't big issues to social liberals which is black
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:27.320]  sites torture unbelievable unbelievable to me that
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:30.920]  these are not mainstream issues on the front pages every day when our
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:34.840]  government is openly acknowledging in many ways warrantless wiretapping
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:38.280]  just the fact that we're being spied on blows my mind they came out in reuters
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:40.840]  and said yeah the pentagon everybody reads your bank
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.680]  account every day i mean totally illegal nixon was gonna go to jail for it
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:48.120]  and now it's just like big deal right so my point is this
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.560]  so you see a turf war right so here's this dividing line
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:55.880]  okay let's say let's say freethinkers like you and i are over here and we're
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.640]  in our little huddled mass and then and then this crowd over here wants to
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.920]  control everything and then and let's call it the the uninformed in
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:06.040]  the middle well this turf war is going on it's like a football game where
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:09.720]  nobody can really score a touchdown right they haven't stamped people like
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:12.280]  you and me out and and certainly we're not going to
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.240]  stamp them out anytime soon so it's back and forth
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.640]  but if something happens where there's this open moment
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.560]  where suddenly 10 20 million people are suddenly searching for new information
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:26.680]  because something gets exposed you know what i
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.960]  mean i think you have to be able to step into that void with a message that's
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.000]  greater than fear or greater than the than the counter
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.920]  response to the fear because look and and you and i've talked
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:41.720]  in private besides publicly and you know as i said
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:45.480]  when i said it this in the same spot before even if you're
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:49.400]  right it's so hard for your average american
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:52.840]  to believe it's true do you know what i mean so there's a
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:55.480]  sort of a transitional moment it's like in a it's like
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:58.520]  you know in the matrix when they realize they're in the matrix there's a moment
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:00.760]  like how is this even possible or when they
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.240]  talk about people get out of jail and they just want to go back to jail
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:06.680]  well it's like the reality is so bad the guy goes i went back in the matrix
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:10.120]  that's my point that's my point i know people i know
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.880]  people and i'm sure many of your listeners have these
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:17.800]  conversations around dinner tables where you know you reel off a list of facts
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:22.200]  did you realize this thing and they go i just don't want to know i
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:25.000]  mean they they're they're raising and it's because they have a legitimate
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.520]  point the power structure seized what do you do about it anyways but then
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.840]  if you give in that just greases the skid
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:34.760]  but but my point is is those people that sit around those dinner tables that that
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:37.960]  that admit to their son or their daughter or their uncle
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.400]  hey you got a point i know things are weird and govern
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.520]  but i'm not gonna do it but but there will come a point where it's going to
[02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:47.160]  touch them in a way where they're gonna have to do something
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:50.520]  well i'll expand on that i'm now hearing mainline talk radio
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.960]  when mohammed karzai came out and said the u.s government runs taliban al-qaeda
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:58.600]  which is well known i heard all these hosts now going you know our government
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:00.360]  is isn't even our government it's interests
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.080]  that just want wars because they're like they run them in
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.720]  libya they run them in syria karzai says they run al-qaeda taliban
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:11.240]  and and then i heard the local host and i heard others go you know they do grow
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:14.200]  the opium over there there should be why do we have a war on drugs
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:18.840]  it's like i think i listen i don't want to be over positive
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.600]  but if people just get the word out say like put your
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.280]  body against the machine realize that these things are going on
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.120]  i don't think you can move forward without our consent and i and it's not
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:34.600]  even but see that's exactly my point right
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:38.440]  as as as with any let's let's let's be cold
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:43.080]  it's a game right this is a big game and who gets to win and who gets to control
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.880]  how the pieces move about the board okay there is going to come a point they
[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:52.040]  may knock the whole board off well that may happen but that would only
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:55.560]  happen if they're willing to admit that people like you are right
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:59.400]  right that'll be a double that'll totally legitimize double down right
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:03.960]  right but the point is is it let's say let's say there's something
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.360]  cataclysmic worthy of knocking all the pieces off the board worthy of shutting
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:12.200]  down the internet worthy of silencing any dissident voices
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:15.640]  even ones that would be considered mild dissident voices
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:19.080]  like has happened in other historical moments of
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:23.720]  tyranny right and what and what and every time it was the same justification
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:26.440]  we're doing this for the motherland or the fatherland or the
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:31.080]  there'll be you know the excuse will exist it's what the populace does in
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:35.720]  that moment that will determine whether it's going to be 50 more years
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.600]  worse or or it's going to have to go through the incredibly
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:46.200]  difficult uh kvetching of reality if we've been in an imperial
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.560]  system all along which there is evidence to suggest that
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:52.840]  you've been an imperial system all along well we're going to have to be
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:55.160]  accountable every person's going to have to be
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:58.520]  accountable on some emotional i agree and there's going to be a price
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:02.280]  but but the price is too big to keep going what you just said
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:05.480]  if they do push it to that i think all the fake liberals all the fake
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:08.680]  conservatives what's happening is they've denied denied denied and when
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:12.520]  you deny so long you get to where you'll deny anything
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.720]  just to say you were right but then it becomes so
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.920]  what was the word you used absurdist going on there
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:24.120]  it becomes so absurdist that it that that it becomes a joke and i think
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:27.720]  that's what's happening in the past like robert gibbs three weeks ago on tv
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.000]  you know he came out and said that they they told him there's no such thing as
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.080]  drones and this is a guy he's supposed to go out
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:35.320]  there and put his entire credibility on the line i mean
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.880]  think of him as a human being and he said it's wizard of oz this is an
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.520]  admitted program saying let's look at it from a slightly
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.120]  spiritual perspective i mean robert gibbs is a real human being
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:47.720]  right yeah okay i'm sure he's got a family smart guy
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:51.160]  he's obviously made his way up through the ranks he probably worked you know
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:54.440]  crap jobs so there he is you're the you're the
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.720]  pr guy for the president you know if you're a pr guy i mean that's the job
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.000]  you're you're the number one guy in in america you got the best job comes to
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.920]  medium and then they tell you they sit out there and just basically lie
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:07.640]  i mean this guy's gonna put his entire credibility his entire career on the
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.400]  line and lie about something and then why
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.880]  would he come out now and say it i'm seeing more and more of that
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:15.080]  because it's like any other regime he's thinking i don't want to go down with
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:18.520]  this ship you're seeing now there was another uh
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:21.000]  insider uh can't remember what it was about
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.040]  recently where another guy just he wrote a book but see
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:27.720]  i think that gibbs moment was like my piers morgan moment more and more people
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:29.720]  are going i'm not going to play along anymore
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:33.640]  but the question is the question if we're talking about it coldly like a
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:36.520]  game right the question is does anybody care if
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:39.880]  the tree falls in the forest so the spiritual issue is people better start
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:43.080]  caring again because but that's my point to you is you
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:47.240]  can win all day long on the facts
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.920]  okay i once i once here and sat here and said even if everything you say is wrong
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:55.720]  i like the argument now let me reverse it even if everything you say is right
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:15:59.800]  there is a segment of the people in this war in this country particularly and in
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:02.600]  this world that we need to get on board we're not
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:05.400]  going to get them on board with fear we're not going to get them on board
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:09.560]  with facts we have to touch some other part of what exactly what do i do
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:12.840]  that's what i'm saying i think you have to you have to diversify your message
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:15.800]  into a broader thing that's sort of unassailable okay let's
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:18.920]  use the star wars analogy the death star is orbiting the moon star
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:21.400]  wars you know episode four it's about to shoot the moon
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:23.880]  and that's right when they blow it up it's kind of that moment when both line
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.480]  up that's the stars are aligning it's going to be
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:30.200]  in that fulcrum point the dark side's gonna win
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:33.960]  yeah and set you back chills in years yeah or
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:37.880]  or you're gonna you're gonna go in i mean because just because you stop that
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.840]  dust star doesn't mean you can stop the next one in the next one in the next one
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:43.240]  yeah so
[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:48.520]  all right folks entering this prime jump
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.520]  point zone this crossroads in closing the best interview i think
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:55.320]  i've ever done here this is amazing and i don't have just said this is a
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:59.800]  powerful you said we need to have a spiritual talk i think this has been a
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:03.160]  transcendent talk i want you to look at that camera out there
[02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:07.000]  and and just right out there in the last five minutes and just you've got the
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.840]  floor other points you think are important
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.880]  because you've definitely taken me a long way into understanding
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:14.280]  you said alex you need to hit that next level and you weren't you're like i
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:16.920]  don't know exactly what it is but we all need to hit that next level
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.760]  to beat this that martin luther king gandhi or what jesus talked about that
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:23.320]  moment so what in your gut your spirit right
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:26.280]  now what do we do then i'm talking to the people because you're right if they
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:29.080]  don't want this freedom if they don't want to be free if they
[02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:32.760]  want to be slaves then we're going down that's what i'm saying what do we say to
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.440]  them i think you have to find it's it's it's
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:39.000]  look just because i wrote one good song
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.560]  doesn't mean people are going to listen to the next one or the next one or the
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:44.280]  next one it's the it's the it's the collective
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.800]  message that i've been able to create that's
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:48.840]  allowed me to have a wonderful musical life
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:51.560]  because i've been able to create sort of a broader message that has an appeal to
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:54.040]  lots of different people for lots of different reasons
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.640]  i think you've been at the tip of the spear for a long time
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:01.880]  personally on some level that's worn you down because you you you are literally
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:05.480]  shouting against a mountain every day if you can draw from a deeper well of
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:08.920]  source sources that go back thousands of years
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:12.440]  so i need to climb another mountain that's what i'm saying you go go read
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:15.480]  go read or bring in somebody who's an expert in in
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:17.960]  in people who have a deeper understanding that bring in the
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:21.880]  historical and spiritual perspectives because we're not the first people that
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:24.120]  have faced this yes we're the first people
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.600]  that have ever faced this in this way with technology being at the core the
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:31.960]  immediacy of communication but you can't tell me 500 years ago or
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:34.680]  a thousand years ago people weren't facing the same paradigm
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:36.920]  well they were facing the roman army that was like
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:40.840]  you know super high tech compared to them tell me that was any different
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.960]  tell me was it was the natives facing people with guns yeah i'm saying
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:47.240]  how how how did how were those things overcome you said you're reading a book
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:49.960]  right now about the african slave trade i've read those two it's amazing i mean
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:52.840]  yeah it's uh i i can't think of the man man's name was
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:57.720]  barth he traveled in in islamist uh africa in the 1850s
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:01.080]  there's a german guy but somehow i got a british commission
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:04.120]  and uh you know obviously the british were sending them down there to
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:07.400]  see how reasonable would be to go and intel plunder
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:10.760]  exactly scoping uh but he was a scientist and he he
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:14.520]  rationalized going but he he witnessed you know what was an awful slave trade
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:18.920]  and he he said that in his notes he said that
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:24.520]  the the the african slave trade trade on other african tribes was shocking him
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:27.720]  he thought it was simply sort of an imperialistic type of thing you know
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:29.560]  slave and they realized that the slave trade
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:33.720]  was going on why why were africans enslaving other
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:37.320]  tribes because it was you know you know your big tank against
[02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:39.400]  my big tank it's just a different paradigm
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:42.920]  and my point is it's well it's like local cops this system's destroying
[02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:45.480]  their kids future but they'll still be mercenaries and do
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:50.040]  it they'll but but look i would take anybody at any system i once went out
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:52.920]  with a woman who grew up in this in the soviet system
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:56.920]  emigrated in the 80s lived there until she was 11 years old
[02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:00.440]  she said her parents would tell her don't don't talk too loud about the
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.320]  government because the neighbors will report us
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:06.600]  i mean imagine growing up in a society like that well you know what now we
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:09.400]  actually have to think about no no they have people report us all the
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.560]  time we have fbi showing up all the time and i mean i can't hand magazines out
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.560]  when i was on the trip in closing down in
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.480]  galveston taking a few days off with the kids
[02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:21.160]  down there at the beach and max cabrera with the street team you know local crew
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:24.280]  we hired i talked about this that's been doing this for years never had it happen
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:27.080]  he goes yeah they said we can't have bumper stickers on the car and i go you
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:30.360]  mean parked in a parking space he goes yeah they said well they're
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:34.120]  going to arrest us for that if we you'll give us a ticket we don't leave
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:37.320]  and we can't have a magazine i said you're i go this is a joke right and he
[02:20:37.320 --> 02:20:40.200]  goes no even i thought it was a joke and then
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:42.840]  because that'd be national news what happened in you know russia or something
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:45.560]  today and then i i said next time the cops come
[02:20:45.560 --> 02:20:48.600]  up call me so he calls me they're there with the code enforcer
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:51.720]  and the guy goes no i'm a listener i don't like doing this but my boss told
[02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:54.520]  me i'm gonna do this you need to take the stickers off or
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:56.920]  we're gonna give you tickets and if you don't go then they're arrested
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:21:00.680]  let's look at it from a different perspective the guy that's standing there
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:03.880]  right i'm a listener i know this is stupid
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:08.760]  but this guy up here told me i better do it i meet tsa agents who are frisking me
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:11.720]  down who are embarrassed to be frisking me
[02:21:11.720 --> 02:21:14.120]  down because they know my music and they know
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:16.600]  me and you know they know i'm not a terrorist right
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:23.640]  and they're embarrassed why why are why are good-hearted americans willing to
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:27.880]  follow orders do you know what i mean you know why in
[02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:31.560]  other tyrannical regimes were those people willing to follow orders i think
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:34.680]  you have to address those questions and i don't think you can address to
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:37.560]  address them on the on the veracity of the fact
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:41.080]  which is it's dumb okay most people if you sat them down at a table and explain
[02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:44.440]  the story they'd say that's dumb okay but this kind of dumb stuff's going
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:49.320]  on every day kids being expelled you know uh some kids said to another
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:52.280]  kid five years old something about shooting them i mean i
[02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:55.400]  grew up playing cowboys and indians it doesn't mean i give a
[02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:58.760]  donut looks like a gun they're kicked out what about the bubble gun girl
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:02.520]  right what i'm saying is i think you have to you have to start getting into
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:06.120]  the mind of of and i hear you say it and and i and
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:08.600]  i think it's a powerful message when you say hey you know
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:11.320]  you out there who think you know you're going to get away with this and they're
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:14.600]  not going to come looking for you at some point you know don't be fooled
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:17.160]  right but i think you have to get into the heart and mind of what their
[02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:20.120]  motivation is you know in wrestling we they know that
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:23.080]  but they're in the minute they're scared what they say in wrestling right the bad
[02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:26.920]  guy has to believe in what he's doing so even the bad guy believes in what he's
[02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:29.480]  doing you know he's been propagandized i'm
[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:33.080]  doing i'm beating this kid down for america or you know whatever they're
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:36.120]  thinking you understand i'm dropping this drone on a whole
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:39.560]  wedding party to get one guy collateral down i'm killing a terrorist
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:43.000]  i would like you to see see you broaden the message and bring in people
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.680]  who can speak to this kind of whether it's a historian
[02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:50.440]  i mean maybe once a week it could be a special feature a historian
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:54.120]  uh bringing people from the catholic church bringing buddhists bringing
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:58.920]  native american elders ask how do you guys view this or girls
[02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:03.320]  maybe your message and maybe the message of of other enlightened thinkers
[02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:07.000]  really only reaches people who have enough educational background or
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.760]  cognitive background to recognize that it's a good argument
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:14.840]  right a lot of people are raised on junk food and gilligan's island
[02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:19.080]  and probably don't have the i'm not saying they're stupid but they don't
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:22.040]  have the intellectual capacity because they've never been in that situation to
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:26.680]  have to think like that a lot of lower classes which i come from
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:30.280]  in my family background they're predicated on survival
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:33.640]  right what was what was some of the way the election was
[02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:37.560]  this last election was waged it's survival hey if i vote for this guy
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:41.080]  i got a better chance to survive and then if i go vote for and then he raises
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:45.080]  payroll taxes on poor people it's too late now right what i'm saying
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:49.000]  is my point is is you gotta you gotta explain to somebody
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:53.320]  who doesn't necessarily think like you i think you diversify
[02:23:53.320 --> 02:23:57.640]  the import of the message so that it resonates at a higher level
[02:23:57.640 --> 02:24:02.440]  right most people believe in what america means even though there's plenty
[02:24:02.440 --> 02:24:07.000]  evidence to suggest we've killed and maimed plenty right there
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.720]  are people out there veterans who who really struggle with
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:15.480]  why they went here you know i know one kid who struggles with why he went over
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:18.520]  to iraq and the power structure knows that
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:21.320]  they get them when they're 18 knowing later they're going to wake up
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:24.120]  but by then they're now listed as the terrorist what do you think about them
[02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:26.520]  saying veterans are the number one terror threat
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:30.680]  it's interesting from this perspective uh
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:34.120]  look you know you watch the you know basketball game
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:37.480]  and there's the commercial for the you know uh
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:40.520]  whatever the air force and it's like a video game you know
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:44.280]  drones and you know it looks like i literally think it's a video game
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:47.000]  commercial until i realize it's for the for the air force or something they're
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.200]  blurring it right but they're bringing these people
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:53.400]  in believing a set of ideals which is
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:58.120]  consistent with you know uh american uh greatness or something and
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:01.080]  freedom right okay so let's say let's say you
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:05.320]  believe it and you and and nothing i say or you say would change their mind
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.080]  america's the best and i did this for a reason i serve my country
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:12.360]  well now we have a lot of evidence to suggest that uh they're not being
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:15.320]  supported when they come home the veterans administrations all this kind
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:19.320]  of stuff right and even like uh them not allowing them
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:24.600]  to show the coffins when they come back all that kind of stuff right why
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:28.040]  are they flipping that narrative because that's a pretty big flip
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:31.160]  from you're a hero you know applaud the troops
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:34.120]  to you can't even hold now we don't trust you with a gun
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.960]  gun wow or i saw that clip where the the city councilman
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.400]  objected because there was a guy in the in the was a veteran
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.600]  had a right to carry and he got did you see that clip yes
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.680]  and he got up and left because he said i don't want to be in here and
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.040]  the guy was not breaking the law he's a veteran
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.480]  you know what i mean they want to send him to foreign countries to kill people
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.040]  but now when they have that right to defend themselves and have a second
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:00.200]  amendment here they don't want to be around it it's like
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:02.760]  but again the technocrats want to send them to kill
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:06.040]  but now they're scared of them i'm trying to take i'm just using this as a
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:08.440]  point to illustrate what i'm talking about
[02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:12.680]  what's the higher perspective on that why do we sell somebody so hard as a
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:15.320]  hero and then what propaganda do we need to
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:19.080]  use to believe that they're dangerous it's like spiking a cannon after a war
[02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.960]  they're decommissioning a weapon right but what why do they need to do it
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:26.760]  that way that's why i'm saying i watch that trends yeah
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:31.320]  why are they because it's waking people up i think the establishment
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:34.120]  has been very smart and professional in the past but i think they've been
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:36.440]  smoking their own dope i mean more and more because i always
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:38.920]  heard the argument that you know the elite are crazy and i'm like oh no you
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:44.200]  know they've got it all together i why do you think they're doing it
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.040]  that's a really good question i think that's a very real question
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:55.000]  um i think the speed of information even to the let's say you're let's say
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.800]  you're you're in in american intelligence and
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:00.360]  you're actually sitting at the top of the data heap
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:03.560]  and you can see where it's going and you're talking to the guy who's
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:08.280]  predicting what it's going to be like in 20 or 30 years
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:12.200]  i think even if you're that guy or that woman you're sitting on top of that data
[02:27:12.200 --> 02:27:14.040]  heap i think the speed at which this is
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:17.560]  moving is is probably almost beyond human conception
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:20.840]  all right and again i did like an hour-long interview that's 20 minutes of
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:23.000]  it and we're going to air the rest of it on
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.440]  the nightly news tonight smashingpumpkins.com
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:29.640]  all the great music and information up there
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:32.840]  and again when i'm not all wound up on air it's really interesting to sit back
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:35.720]  for hours and hear billy talk about stuff he really has a
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.000]  deep grasp on the world and what's going on in it
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.160]  speaking of the craziness going on in the world
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:49.080]  john rapoport is going to be joining us with his article the cia james homes
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:53.800]  mk ultra and truth serum in hiding in plain view last week the denver post and
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:59.880]  others said oh the judge uh is going to order
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:04.120]  a truth serum to make him answer questions
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:08.440]  uh in the trial well when you're under mind control the very drugs they call
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:12.600]  truth serums are the ones they put you on along with
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:16.280]  hallucinogens to put you in the altered state where
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:19.320]  you don't know who you are i mean it's pretty easy to get a bunch of
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.040]  people on a high dose of acid and flip them out and make them go do violence
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.080]  while they're on it you can take a normal person and put
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.400]  them on enough hallucinogens lsd pcp at the same time and a lot of the time you
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.320]  could get them to go in and kill their whole family
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.320]  just in a one-off they've done the test and shown that
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.160]  and congress has done hearings on it but when you get somebody for months in
[02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:42.440]  a darpa program you can look at all the graduate students in the darpa
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:45.480]  program at the university you got pentagon people over them you give
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:48.040]  them a 30-something thousand dollar grant to pay for their house
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:51.800]  they're in a brain interface mind control program and they're on all these
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.440]  drugs and now they don't want to release the toxicology report
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.720]  they admit he was on seven drugs psychotropics at his house all these
[02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:01.480]  weird connections the preparation all of it the way it
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:04.600]  was rolled out uh the air the top air force a
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:07.320]  psychiatrist was over a whole base in san antonio
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:11.720]  assigned to him reported books that the prosecutors and defense aren't even
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.680]  wanting books that you know are probably where he was planning it
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:18.040]  all because these guys also have a notebook that they write in that's part
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:22.200]  of their control book uh it's like catcher in the rye you know
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:25.560]  it's like keywords just standard turned out sir and sir
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:29.080]  hand was under mind control that's pretty much come out so we're
[02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:32.760]  going to be looking at that but uh again uh calling it like it is
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:35.400]  we're all under mind control the government runs al-qaeda
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:38.760]  it's admitted to hundreds of publications but still al-qaeda's
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:41.720]  are enemies who have to give our rights up and the government's good and the
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:44.200]  government's got to be able to kill citizens because of al-qaeda
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:48.200]  when they are running al-qaeda that's the headline obama now global head of

[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:44.360]  well john rapaport is a graduate of amherst college the ba in philosophy and
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:47.800]  has worked on a freelance investigative reporter for 30 years
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:51.080]  and again he's worked for some of the largest publications
[02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:54.840]  in the country in uninvestigated reporting the los angeles times
[02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:58.520]  you name it and of course he's also done investigations for international and
[02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:03.320]  national television programs no more fake news dot com is his
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:07.000]  website and he is a frequent guest to this broadcast but i
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:14.360]  saw the denver post and others last week engaged in unbelievable
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:21.000]  off the chart gigantic mind control operations where they just
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.480]  calmly and i'll pull up the headlines for you in a moment
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:27.400]  where they if you're a tv viewer i'll give the headlines out to radio listeners
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:31.560]  you can search it yourself oh judge to order homes to take truth
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:35.320]  serum during trial and they just report it like oh that's a
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:38.840]  good thing thank god they're doing that folks that that group that family of
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:41.640]  drugs is what they use to put you into mind control
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:45.160]  i mean that's that's even in movies like conspiracy theory you know about mind
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:47.720]  control of mel gibson i mean even in hollywood movies
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:52.200]  people know that serhan serhan was put on amnesic drugs that later came out
[02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:55.640]  even the la pd said that said he didn't shoot him
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:35:00.040]  there have been court cases now proving there was cia there when rfk got shot so
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:03.960]  this is so crazy that you've got him getting 30 plus thousand dollars
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:07.560]  like 27,000 in one check and 7,000 8,000 another
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:13.400]  over 30,000 in darpa department of defense advanced research laboratories
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:20.200]  funding to him in a secret brain program that he'd been in since high school
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.400]  i mean he was brought in from high school into college programs
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:27.320]  but only the smartest uh do they do that within the testing
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.160]  and then here he is been in college for years he had everything's paid for with
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:34.840]  this grant and he's got an air force psychologist
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:39.160]  psychiatrist top level over him and and then they report multiple smoke
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.160]  bombs and multiple shooters he tells people in the jail i i was
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:46.840]  drugged i was under mind control that came out in the local news
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:49.640]  and then they said oh no he wasn't around any prisoners even though for
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:51.960]  weeks they reported the first few days he was
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:55.080]  with those prisoners next door to him and now he was hissing and screaming and
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:57.960]  yelling now he's off the drugs says he doesn't
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:00.680]  remember anything they're keeping him very sequestered
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:05.480]  and now they want to drug him again to to go back to being the personality he
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:07.880]  was the personality that thinks he did the
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:10.600]  shooting or may have done the shooting or taken part in it
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:13.240]  i mean ladies and gentlemen they could take even a strong-willed person like
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:16.280]  myself they could take you and they can with
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:22.600]  shock therapy lsd pcp peyote uh halcyon other amnesics
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:28.440]  sodium pentothal they can make you chop your newborn baby up they can make
[02:36:28.440 --> 02:36:31.400]  you think you're another person they can make you who have the skills be
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:34.440]  an opera singer i mean they can program you
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.280]  and again it's in the mk ultra mk naomi congressional hearings in the 70s
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:42.840]  this has all come out okay and i'm ranting we're gonna go to john
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:45.480]  rapoport who's an expert on this and he's written the article
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:48.840]  the cia james homes mk ultra and truth serum torture
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:52.600]  but here's the psyop on everybody they're reporting they're going to drug
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:55.800]  him with mind control drugs three of them we're going to list them
[02:36:55.800 --> 02:36:59.880]  here in public so this is the new thing they're going to not just
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:02.920]  drug you till you say you did something in the jail without charging you as
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.480]  they've done in cases some people in federal prison for
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:08.760]  10 years before trial drugging them saying they're mentally ill getting him
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:12.360]  ready for trial in the case of dr cell a dentist who they
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:15.400]  said did medicare fraud he fought it so they just grabbed him and drugged him
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:20.440]  in kansas city so imagine this there's so many cases of this now where
[02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:24.280]  they're grabbing lawyers that sue williamson county north of austin and so
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:28.520]  they go arrest the lawyer and commit them for two years i mean this is
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:31.480]  dangerous ladies and gentlemen and now they're out in the open going
[02:37:31.480 --> 02:37:34.120]  yeah we're now going to drug americans for trial
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:37.720]  with mind control drugs this is now get mo
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:41.480]  going mainstream now i'm ranting i want to go directly to
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:45.320]  john rapoport but it's just like they hide obama being the head of al-qaeda
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:49.560]  publicly and commanding al-qaeda and so we put the headline out obama now
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:53.400]  global head of al-qaeda that sounds crazy because it is absurdist
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.880]  you've got a counter absurdist garbage by stating how absurdist it is
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:01.400]  not processing it and watering it down now
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:04.920]  john i'm ranting here but what is your take on this uh
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:08.360]  being out in the open what does this signify are they all going to start
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:12.760]  publicly drugging us for trial so we say we did bad things
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:16.760]  yeah this is mk ultra going mainstream alex this is exactly
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:21.720]  that this is the old cia program and the new cia program
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:27.560]  this is we're going to drug you till you say what we want you to say and what
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:30.680]  most people don't realize about mk ultra was
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:34.760]  it started out one big part of it as we're going to find a truth drug you
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.640]  know this was back in the early 50s they couldn't find one in other words
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:42.520]  these drugs don't work to make you tell the truth
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:47.240]  what they do is they destroy your mind or they terrify you to the point where
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.240]  you will say what they want you to say that's the big
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:56.840]  difference and when they hit on lsd as the drug of choice that's why they
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.280]  used it it wasn't a truth drug it didn't make people tell the truth
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:03.560]  you don't download the truth out of somebody's mind
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:07.560]  with one of these drugs what you do is you either destroy their mind
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:10.920]  altogether make them into a complete babbling idiot
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:14.840]  or you bring them to the point where they're so terrified because of the
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:18.040]  dosage levels you say to them okay you get the point
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:23.000]  now do you want to have this again or are you going to tell what we want
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.440]  you to tell and this is of course all science this
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:29.800]  is all neurology this is all psychiatry this is all
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:37.560]  the very best of the legal system this is the brutal incredibly
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:41.080]  torturous this is torture this is what mk-ulture was
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:44.120]  and now they're just mainstreaming it right out in the open
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:47.560]  here's what's going to happen to james homes and we're going to call it a
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:53.240]  narco-analytic review so it all sounds very fancy and so forth
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:57.960]  and i'll tell you one other thing alex the hacks who are the psychiatrists at
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:02.520]  the colorado state mental system hospitals they don't know
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:05.240]  anything about this i mean they're not the pros or the
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:08.200]  experts they're going to have to bring in pros
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:12.840]  from the agencies that really know how to work these oh no they're going to
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:16.600]  probably bring in his very handlers that ran the operation
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:21.880]  exactly and cia people will be there the people who have worked on this before
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:25.800]  it'll all no i'm saying i bet it's going to be that'll be the prime suspect
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.800]  i bet that you look for who actually programmed him to be who the expert they
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:33.320]  send because because listen mcveigh had jolly
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:37.480]  and west number two under mk ultra congressional hearings admittedly one of
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.160]  the fathers of modern mind control assigned to him for the decade before
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:44.360]  they executed him weekly from the time he was arrested to
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:48.760]  executed jolly and west was there exactly and then as soon as mcveigh
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:51.640]  would get off the drugs he'd tell people no i'm special forces
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:54.520]  they set me up and that's exactly what sworn affidavits
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.080]  from three different people say well this is the same kind of thing you
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:03.240]  bring in the handler you bring in the person who is controlling
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:08.280]  just like in the cia you know i'm your case officer so you report back to me
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:12.600]  so they're going to uh puff this guy up to the point where
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:16.840]  he's going to come back into court he's going to make some kind of bland
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:22.360]  statement like yeah i know i did it uh yes that's true i'm still
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:26.680]  uh i still have problems and then they'll just warehouse this guy for the
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:29.720]  rest of his life and destroy his mind whether it's in prison
[02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:34.120]  or the psych ward it doesn't really matter that's what's going to happen
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:38.600]  this is unprecedented though but but the story this is the cherry on top
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:41.800]  where they lied and said he was never around other inmates when the inmates
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:44.120]  said multiple ones yeah he said he was under mind
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.040]  control that came out in the denver papers
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:49.080]  they went oh no he was never around people even though they'd all admitted
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:51.240]  he had been the fact that they're covering up the
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:55.080]  notebook the fact that he's got this high level top air force psychiatrist
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:57.800]  over him he's in a darpa program i mean how
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:01.320]  transparent does this have to be and now they're going to drug him
[02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:04.520]  with a mind well they're going to several mind control drugs
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:07.560]  to make him tell the truth i mean this is
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:12.680]  like total mainlining of this absolutely and of course when he was arrested you
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:16.600]  know first you had the story that he was there at the exit of the
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:20.600]  theater the night of the shooting and uh he just said i did it or
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:24.680]  something like that and by the way i've wired my entire apartment with
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:28.440]  explosives so don't go near it that was the first incredible uh you
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:31.640]  know bizarre story and that was so they could send in a special federal team to
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:34.360]  cover up the seven medications that later still leak see they don't have
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:37.080]  everybody under their control but you see all the
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:41.080]  signs of the classic cover-up right there there's no doubt in my mind
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.520]  now that aurora was a hundred percent staged
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:48.760]  an operation the second story was well wait a minute we actually found him in
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.880]  his car and he was drugged and he didn't really
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:55.160]  know what was going on and you know but we're going to tell
[02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:59.240]  that story again that's just a rumor and so on so he's drooling in the
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:01.080]  car out waiting i mean they did that with
[02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:05.080]  suryan suryan turned out they pinned his arm all his bullets shot in the wall
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.760]  and then we know the cia agent's name who was assigned to security
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.280]  who worked in the skunk works shot him in the back i mean it's on it's in the
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:16.200]  ny i mean in the lapd file it's public
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:20.360]  absolutely and special unit senator was the name of
[02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.360]  the lapd uh you know office that was especially
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:28.040]  created to investigate the bobby kennedy assassination
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.360]  saying no no feds no anybody this is our special unit
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:36.200]  well because we've got all the evidence we can destroy it right away we can
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.880]  distort it we can do anything and we can blame it all on sirhan and
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.520]  that's exactly what we're going to do so we see this repeated time and time and
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:48.760]  time again with these mind control uh subjects that are put out there as the
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:52.280]  patsies and then they're tuned up
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:56.840]  afterwards so they say the right things you know as long as necessary to put
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:00.280]  them away out of sight so that nobody will ever hear from them again
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:03.240]  and they move right on to the next one well that's what they did with mcveigh
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.080]  is he would disappear for weeks when west would show up who recently died
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:10.600]  and he'd come back not knowing who he was they'd been electro shocking him the
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:12.680]  reports are and then they bring him back because
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:15.160]  he'd start waking up and going i'm special forces
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:18.280]  they did this to me remember the state police found him drooling
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:21.640]  on the side of the road saying help me help me i've got a chip in my butt
[02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:26.440]  remember that right absolutely and then the story they told of course
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:31.240]  uh you know this was a perfect plan this is the fbi talking this incredibly
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:35.160]  brilliant plan except the guy who did it uh just
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:38.600]  happened to have a license plate hanging off his car as he drove away and that's
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:42.040]  why we stopped him on a lonely road and that's how we put him in jail
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:45.080]  you know there were so many contradictions on that story the state
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.440]  police report said drooling begging it burns it burns
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:51.960]  i've got a chip in my butt that's the quote right
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:57.080]  well you know the public as long as they keep buying this dumb show
[02:44:57.080 --> 02:45:00.280]  uh we're going to see more and more and more of these because i mean
[02:45:00.280 --> 02:45:03.480]  you can't get any more ridiculous than this thing that's happening with homes
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:06.280]  now i mean it's there it's right out in the
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:10.520]  open yes we're going to drug this guy and then he'll say what we want them to
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.360]  say i mean anybody can read between the lines on this story and realize
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.560]  that's what we're talking take the fake pentagon trials of all these drugged up
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:19.400]  people that confessed to bombings that happened
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:22.520]  while they were in jail and stuff and from waterboarding and drugging and they
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:24.840]  admit they have a camp with nx right where they do all the drugging and the
[02:45:24.840 --> 02:45:28.440]  cia doctors have a laboratory testing this stuff
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:32.280]  in there even the the officers on the fake tribunal have been quitting and
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:35.480]  stuff and saying this is all a fraud what do
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:38.280]  you make of them publicly admitting they run al-qaeda
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:42.440]  and now karzai coming out and then but but still we've got to give our rights
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:46.200]  up because of al-qaeda more and more it's like their whole
[02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:48.920]  system is out in the open and we have the choice to
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.760]  believe it or not believe it is that by design john because i know you study
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:59.000]  mind control deeply i think it's like a test run you see how stupid are people
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.880]  going to be if we stand up and tell them the truth
[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:05.800]  what's the response going to be because here's how the the programming
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:09.400]  works you get somebody into a hypnotic trance
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:13.400]  over years and years of lies in the media i mean that kind of trance over
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:15.720]  and over again and all of a sudden you stand up and
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:19.880]  you tell the truth about something this creates such an incredible cognitive
[02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:23.480]  dissonance in most people that they pretend they've never even
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:27.080]  heard it this is what happens we didn't hear that
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:30.280]  what do you mean al-qaeda what do you mean drugging uh you know
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:37.160]  homes uh what what no that's impossible people will actually deny the truth
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:41.720]  even when the officials admit to it because the programming is so heavy
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:46.040]  that you know it's like what here are my choices i stay hypnotized
[02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:49.560]  or i believe suddenly the truth is looking right at me
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:53.560]  in which case you know i have to reject all of my life
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:56.840]  well they know that people aren't going to do that so they do these little test
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:00.440]  runs and they say look there's only you know a tenth of one
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:03.560]  percent of people that are saying what's going on here the
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:08.040]  rest are still well i mean look let's punch this up for tv viewers slight.com
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:11.560]  just came out and said can truth serum prove that
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:16.520]  james hones is sane too high to lie they're engaged in
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:19.560]  openly drugging people the guy's never known who he is
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:23.640]  he looked like textbook wide open mind control went off the drugs for days
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.720]  while he was with the cops flopping around
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:29.720]  after it comes out and says they drugged me this is mind control
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:33.880]  help me he tells a whole jail listening help me help me
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:37.400]  and then we go hey he says they drugged him and they go oh no we didn't
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:41.560]  no he no one heard him say that i mean this is this is one of the most
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:44.520]  incredible mind control things i've ever seen out
[02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:46.920]  in the open and and and they're just reporting it
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:50.360]  like oh yeah and they're spinning it we're going to drug him to make him tell
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:54.120]  the truth too high to lie when they drug you to make you highly
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:58.520]  suggestible to say whatever they want that's right either make you highly
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:01.560]  suggestible or torture you i mean because these things are
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:06.040]  torture truth serum is torture it's not there to get the truth it's an anxiety
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:09.000]  drug exactly it's there to put you into the
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:12.600]  kind of panic where you would do anything to get out
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:15.800]  of it anything and then they say to you okay
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:19.080]  here's what we want you to do here's what we want you to say are
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.360]  you going to do it or are we going to do this to you again
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:26.040]  i mean people have to understand that all this business about Gitmo and
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:30.440]  waterboarding and everything did you ever hear in any of the media
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:33.880]  stories that they were saying and were using
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:38.120]  drugs on these prisoners no it was all about isolation tanks and
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:42.760]  waterboarding and making fun of people and all that nonsense of course they're
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:45.880]  using it came out and even in the washington post like it was a good thing
[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:48.520]  like eight years ago that they brought in quote
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:52.760]  prostitutes who were i hate to families listening tell kids to tune out right
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:56.200]  now women dressed in devil outfits doing
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:00.120]  satanic rituals raping the men while they were
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:03.000]  menstruating to totally freak them out while they
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.200]  were on hallucinogens can you imagine being some 14 year old
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:09.320]  from afghanistan who they want to become a new al-qaeda operative that's why they
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:11.480]  manufacture them there well they keep saying why do they all
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:16.120]  become bombers and women are dancing around while you're on drugs
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:19.560]  raping you with blood everywhere i mean it's just
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:22.920]  and the truth is they're just satanist the truth is the cia people just are
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:26.200]  engaged in satanism this is just their excuse in under
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:30.040]  national security to do this why they rape kids at all 30 something camps
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:34.360]  in in uh in afghanistan and iraq because they like it
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.480]  that's why they these are satanist this is what happens when you have an
[02:49:39.480 --> 02:49:44.240]  agency where nobody knows from the beginning
[02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:49.480]  1947 48 all the way up until now nobody knows what they've been doing
[02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:53.640]  i mean untold amounts of billions of dollars in the announced budget and then
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:56.360]  you got the black budget that nobody knows about
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:59.960]  and it's sort of like okay guys this is it
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:03.480]  you go back to the original mk ultra program and you will see
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:08.840]  quotes from people saying things like we were free and wild and we could do
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:11.640]  anything we wanted to there was a guy named george white
[02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:15.880]  who set up a brothel in san francisco where the prostitutes were giving
[02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:21.160]  their john's lsd unknown to the johns and cia guys were looking through
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:24.680]  peepholes at all of this and that's only the cover they were doing it to mayors
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:27.480]  and people they're americans red-blooded americans
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:30.280]  wild and free we can do whatever we want to
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:33.480]  with no restraint well that's what you get
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:36.680]  and that's just the whitewash you know what about uh the people they threw off
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:39.800]  buildings you bet frank olson out of a hotel
[02:50:39.800 --> 02:50:43.320]  window sure absolutely this was all going on under
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:47.720]  sydney got leaves uh leadership helms all these people
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:53.000]  and what came out in the church hearings frank church hearings the 1970s before
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:56.680]  he died mysteriously and then it came out that you and cameron and jolly and
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:00.680]  west were running operations with kids snatched off the streets we'll be right
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:03.800]  back if you're listening you know your basic
[02:51:03.800 --> 02:51:07.720]  freedoms are being threatened every day if you're listening you know the economy
[02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:10.680]  is not getting better you know gas and food prices are

[02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:24.440]  where they're trying to overthrow common sense you've got to decide that you want
[02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:28.760]  to stand with the truth and stop giving into the lie that going
[02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:32.920]  along with corruption is going to make it easy on you that's what lets it grow
[02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:37.000]  okay you need to get an instinct to dislike oppressors and liars and
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:38.840]  scammers so they've got people now where it's
[02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:43.800]  like oh yeah we lie about drones and we tell you it doesn't exist
[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:49.960]  and then now you see michael amore who really is a demon
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:53.960]  licking his lips going we had dead kid photos we'd get their guns
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:59.000]  yeah harry reed's little grandkids were all shot up and dead we'd get the guns
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:03.320]  he's just like yeah that can he just look at the little kids they're dead now
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:06.760]  i mean these are monsters folks they know okay
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:10.200]  and believe me if they'll you know lindsey graham's like yeah we kill 100
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.240]  people per drone attack or whatever collateral damage we don't care
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:16.920]  these men are heroes we're not we're not the ss yeah you're 10 times
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:20.200]  probably worse if you could get there you know they really want to become pure
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:24.520]  evil and and of course they'll do the columbine
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:28.520]  and you look at that same story government run i don't just say that
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:32.200]  you think it's fun to know that i wish it was just lone crazies
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:36.200]  almost every mass shooting is not even a copycat there's a few that are copycats
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:40.600]  with all the media hype it is government run from pillar to post
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:45.480]  from pillar to post folks pillar to post you are collateral damage they teach
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:47.960]  military going back more than four thousand
[02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:52.440]  years about a gambit it is a persian military move where and
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:55.160]  it's been adopted across the board where you put out a hundred horsemen in a
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:57.240]  valley to draw in the main military force so
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.200]  you can attack them from both sides in a pincer
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:03.640]  that's generally one of the basic cavalry moves and you
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:06.760]  you know your hundred horsemen are going to be wiped out
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:09.960]  but the argument is i would have lost the whole battle and lost ten thousand
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:12.760]  horsemen if i wouldn't have killed my hundred
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:16.120]  that's why they send special forces on death missions
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:19.160]  and being in a command position is all about accepting
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:22.840]  the lesser of two evils and all this which is a lie injustifies the means
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:26.840]  machiavelli it is a lie folks because pretty soon
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:29.160]  let's run al-qaeda you know because the public won't do
[02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:32.920]  what we want in the middle east and then they radicalize the muslims to begin
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:36.200]  with john am i on target with what i'm saying here because this is a gambit
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:40.040]  they are staging these events they are they are the ones the globalists
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:43.880]  the people you see on tv i guarantee you these top senators folks they got hands
[02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:46.520]  in it i can look at them and the lip the lip
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:49.080]  licking whenever feinstein licks her lips and goes
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:52.520]  there's going to be more events we're going to get the guns and she licks
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:56.440]  it's a little enjoyment oh the little enjoyment i mean
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:59.480]  do you agree with what i'm saying or have i gone too far no
[02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:03.720]  i don't disagree at all they're staging events i mean this is
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:07.320]  this is the basis on which the whole cia was founded
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:11.960]  if you think about it they went out into the world we're going to stage events
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:16.120]  and change reality that was their mandate it wasn't just to find out
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:19.560]  information it was to create new reality false flags
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.400]  all over the world all over the world all the time because
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:28.040]  look just from a strategic point of view tactical point of view
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  it's a heck of a lot easier to stage your own fake events
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:35.880]  and then come in afterwards than it is to actually go out there as an
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:39.240]  intelligence agency and find out what's happening in the world
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:42.920]  and they figured that out in about five minutes hey guys we don't have to find
[02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:45.960]  out anything all we have to do is to create reality
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:49.640]  with these stage events tell the public what it means rally
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:54.760]  support and here we go into another war it's easy and that's what they get
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.240]  exactly i've talked a lot of good old boys that go well that's what america
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:59.640]  does to get ahead and i go okay let's say we're macchia
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:03.800]  valley we're not getting ahead they're going to use this on us you moron
[02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:08.200]  you get it so many people play the part like they're part of the structure
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:12.760]  what do you call that hey they're not getting ahead
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:16.760]  they're losing they're a bunch of losers who want to be attached to what they
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:20.040]  think is a winner but it's not a winning proposition on
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:24.680]  any any way you want to judge it it's going down
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:28.360]  well i mean i could just feel god you know you call the universe wherever you
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:31.000]  want anger at this i mean this does not go
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.600]  well and and to stay there a little bit of overdrive his skype's having a
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:37.880]  problem right back overdrive with rapid port so much more

[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:35.400]  you know i listen to my show and i sometimes i can't listen to it because i
[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:37.800]  get really obnoxious and start hyperventilating
[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:41.640]  but then i realized one of the few reasons i've been successful
[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:44.440]  is because i am real and i'm fundamentally upset about this i mean
[03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:47.960]  when they're publicly mk altering people on tv now and
[03:00:47.960 --> 03:00:51.240]  i know they staged the shooting that freaks me out
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:55.160]  and i i know i'm in danger doing this but i'm in greater danger if we don't
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:59.800]  oppose these people in the in even the medium term that's why i get so upset
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:03.320]  because i know this is an animating contest for liberty
[03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:07.880]  i know this is for all the marbles i know how much danger we're in
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:12.520]  and i'm genuinely freaked out folks you can't just deny this and it goes away
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:15.560]  i mean these are hardcore killers that run our government now
[03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:19.240]  and that run the world and they want to impoverish us
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:22.600]  john rabbit board i've been ranting but just how do we get people out of their
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:24.760]  trance because i've come out with the article
[03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:28.600]  obama is the head of al-qaeda worldwide will white house target the white house
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:31.400]  thinking people like well that's absurdist no they are the head and if
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:33.640]  they're saying they're gonna go after al-qaeda with drones
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:38.280]  will obama order a strike on himself i mean it's that absurdist you've got to
[03:01:38.280 --> 03:01:41.720]  point it out to get people to wake up to the illusion
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:45.160]  do you see my point yeah absolutely because that's the way
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:48.360]  you do get people to wake up you show them the absurdity
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:52.040]  of what they're already believing you know like obama comes out
[03:01:52.040 --> 03:01:56.200]  after sandy hook and he says guess what i just had this idea
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:00.760]  that we're going to do a 10-year billion dollar project with darpa with
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:05.080]  universities to map the entire brain
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:08.760]  you know how absurd and now this is going to be wonderful we're going to
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:12.760]  cure all these diseases and so forth this is completely absurd
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.040]  all of a sudden you just point out to people hey look don't you understand
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:19.640]  what they're trying to do they're trying to control the brain
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:22.680]  completely that's why they're putting the money in here
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:26.200]  they're not trying to and they're saying something they obviously were involved
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:29.160]  in it staged we need this mind control to stop
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:33.000]  something we did exactly there you go so that puts the cap
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:37.560]  on the absurdity yeah we did this over here now we use
[03:02:37.560 --> 03:02:40.840]  that to promote this over here and and
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:44.040]  you're going along with it right because you're idiots
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:51.400]  so yeah you want to wake up you want to stay asleep and this is
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:56.200]  shoving it in people's faces the absurdity of this alex is exactly what

[03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:09.480]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:09.480 --> 03:08:18.600]  ladies and gentlemen one reason i know that it's government
[03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:22.040]  psyops that is always running around saying i
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:27.480]  work for the cia and all this stuff is because whenever i admit that i've
[03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:31.240]  had quite a bit of family that was in the cia
[03:08:31.240 --> 03:08:35.080]  they never attack that or go ferret into that
[03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:38.680]  because that's operations you know that's that's connected to their system
[03:08:38.680 --> 03:08:42.520]  they don't want that looked at that's why they make up outlandish stuff
[03:08:42.520 --> 03:08:45.080]  about me because they don't want you to believe there could be a real person
[03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:48.520]  standing up for liberty the info i'm giving you i don't want you
[03:08:48.520 --> 03:08:51.320]  to trust me i want you to go look into it
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:54.760]  i want you to go find out that we talk about mind control
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:58.360]  that it's a real thing and that and that once you know what it is you see it
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:03.720]  going on and you catch them red-handed uh and i've told a few of the cia stories
[03:09:03.720 --> 03:09:07.080]  you know just from i mean anybody i know in my family they recruited heavily you
[03:09:07.080 --> 03:09:12.200]  know out of farming areas in in texas and i've you know i've talked to people
[03:09:12.200 --> 03:09:14.440]  or other family talks people that were in the cia
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:17.960]  they were almost all army officers that's where they recruit from
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:22.040]  uh who were combat veterans who they then bring into it and all of the people
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:25.400]  in my family got out of it that's another lie that
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:27.400]  you don't get out of it that that's pure bull
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:30.920]  ladies and gentlemen uh and the point is they won't ever even really talk much
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:35.400]  about it just it's unspeakably horrible they run everything the murder the drugs
[03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:40.040]  all of it uh one great uncle it was basically
[03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:42.520]  told my dad about it and then i asked about a little bit so i'm not getting
[03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:45.080]  into that but yeah what was like okay you're an army officer
[03:09:45.080 --> 03:09:48.520]  we're sheep dipping you he'd been in the army for like 15 years
[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:52.200]  all over the world he said we're now going to have you
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:55.560]  this is your graduation not as just a asset but as a
[03:09:55.560 --> 03:09:59.080]  you know officer as this full-blown cia agent
[03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:03.000]  and it was dealing drugs and reportedly killing people
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  in chicago and he said i'm not doing that and got out of it
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:11.320]  and and i mean that but listen it's the same story
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:15.080]  with like anybody that i talked to and folks because it's not like it's a big
[03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:16.920]  deal that oh they really wanted to recruit
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:20.600]  you know out of some of the alex jones's relatives there's cia everywhere
[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:23.560]  it's like jesse ventura goes down first day at work they go somebody wants to
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:26.760]  talk to you in the bottom of the capital he goes down there there's 26 whatever
[03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:29.960]  it was cia people there were like little old ladies and
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:33.160]  guys that look like milkmen or you know you know beer men or whatever
[03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:36.520]  and they were cia and wouldn't even say who they were but it was national
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:39.160]  security it's giant ladies and gentlemen and
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:46.280]  there's like 15 16 agencies and private merc groups and it's so evil
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:50.120]  it is a mafia with mind control and again it works for the foreign banks
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:53.880]  and there's all these movies about the cia loves you and the red flat you know
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:58.200]  red white and blue and oh my gosh and they do have the light side
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:01.960]  that does the analyst stuff that they send in they send in the good guys are
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:04.440]  all like a joke they send them out on commando missions
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:08.920]  to be killed you know and again they laugh at them
[03:11:08.920 --> 03:11:11.640]  and i've talked to joel scowlson who's you know had those connections and
[03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:15.240]  family and stuff same story same deal ladies and gentlemen that's
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:18.680]  they get the most gung-ho meanest people they can
[03:11:18.680 --> 03:11:22.280]  and then they see are you evil tough guy are you a nice tough guy
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:25.640]  and the nice tough guys are cannon fodder so i'm going to warn everybody
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:28.920]  if you're a police officer and they want you to work for the feds and do bombing
[03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:30.760]  drills they're going to blow something up maybe
[03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:34.360]  not your time but down the road they're going to blow something up say a cop did
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:37.480]  it to say the cops are terrorists when the feds want to have a purge of you
[03:11:37.480 --> 03:11:40.520]  when they want to if you're military they want you to join an intelligence
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:43.480]  agency and infiltrate criminal groups they're going
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:47.240]  to burn you down the road and say you do what we say and help load up
[03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:50.520]  these toddlers on a c-130 10 years after you're into it
[03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:54.600]  or we're going to expose all your bank robberies and all your drug dealing
[03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:58.440]  i mean that's all this is is about compromising everybody
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:03.160]  okay that's all this is and they're going to destroy our culture
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:06.840]  because they're into it i'm ranting and this segment the next john robert
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:09.000]  break down mind control as you were getting into
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:12.600]  uh you know jolly and west his controller dr ewing cameron
[03:12:12.600 --> 03:12:16.840]  what is admitted for people that don't know so why we know james homes is under
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:20.760]  mind control go ahead you and cameron uh as i was starting to
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:24.920]  say before we went to the break not only were they pulling people off
[03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:29.800]  the street but people were coming to him as patients
[03:12:29.800 --> 03:12:33.720]  you know somebody walks into his office here's a famous psychiatrist up in
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:36.600]  canada i'm not feeling very well and i think i
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:41.720]  need some oh sure whatever and all of a sudden that person
[03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:46.760]  you know from anywhere could be you could be your cousin could be anybody
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:51.640]  is now in a program where they're being put to sleep
[03:12:51.640 --> 03:12:57.480]  for 30 days with heavy heavy drugs awakened in the middle of the night for
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:02.760]  electroshock treatments 20 to 40 times higher than the usual
[03:13:02.760 --> 03:13:06.360]  torture of shock treatments then they're going to
[03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:09.400]  be listening to you and cameron with these tapes
[03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:14.200]  saying over and over again how he's creating a new personality
[03:13:14.200 --> 03:13:18.280]  and then they spit that out the other side new person
[03:13:18.280 --> 03:13:22.360]  yeah new person totally destroyed totally destroyed
[03:13:22.360 --> 03:13:26.040]  and of course you can read about this because there were lawsuits eventually
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:28.360]  brought and it was proven that cameron was
[03:13:28.360 --> 03:13:32.600]  working on a contract via the cia and they had to pay out some pit and some
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:36.760]  money to these people but this was just one little pocket of
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:41.640]  what mk ultra was all about destroying people totally to give them new
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:45.080]  synthetic personalities and again they even have
[03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:48.360]  history channel shows admitting it all and of course it
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:51.080]  was also because they like to abuse kids that's really the cover
[03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:54.520]  it is the mind control and erasing their memories
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:58.920]  but expanding on that you describe how yeah not just kids off the street
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:02.040]  wealthy people will bring in their daughter who was depressed at age 10 you
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:05.160]  know because they describe all the cases thousands and thousands of something
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:08.840]  10,000 plus kids they know about and they'd say oh just just commit her
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:12.680]  here i'll make her perfect in a year and they go here take our daughter you
[03:14:12.680 --> 03:14:15.080]  know worshiping the psychiatrist because he's gone
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:18.280]  and they would literally electroshock drug them
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:23.000]  you know rape them everything else and oh that couldn't be true the doctor
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:26.760]  wouldn't do something like that and let me tie that in alex with what
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:30.840]  happens uh in ordinary psychiatry see because
[03:14:30.840 --> 03:14:34.520]  people have this false firewall that they build between
[03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:39.640]  mk ultra and the cia in psychiatry just forget about that erase that wall
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:43.080]  you're in a university you're a student you're feeling a little bit jittery
[03:14:43.080 --> 03:14:47.240]  anxious about exams whatever you go in to see the psychologist you
[03:14:47.240 --> 03:14:50.280]  get referred and you're sitting in a psychiatrist
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:53.720]  office and then they give you a prescription for a drug
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:14:57.480]  and this is based on a story by peter bragan in his famous book toxic
[03:14:57.480 --> 03:15:00.440]  psychiatry this was a girl that he calls roberta
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:03.240]  and you know she has some anxiety about dating
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:07.320]  and so ends up this drug well we don't think that's the one we'll give you this
[03:15:07.320 --> 03:15:10.840]  drug no and finally they're putting her on
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:17.080]  serious heavy anti-psychotic drugs and she gets to the point where she can
[03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:20.840]  no longer talk function this is a bright girl from a
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:25.800]  decent home went to college hey the american way she's mumbling she
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:29.720]  can't move without tremoring she's knocking her head against the
[03:15:29.720 --> 03:15:33.640]  wall all the time and eventually she comes to a
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:39.960]  general practitioner who says this is all from the drugs they've
[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:43.960]  destroyed her life she's never going to be the same and
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:48.520]  nobody's prosecuted nobody's criticized oh it's the psychiatrist who did this
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:53.160]  this could happen to any student on any campus at any university and let me tell
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:56.840]  you who it happened to in the early 1960s it was a man named
[03:15:56.840 --> 03:16:00.680]  ted kaczynski you may have heard of him the unibomber
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:03.720]  and i believe they had him to cut out the whole time to put out that eugenics
[03:16:03.720 --> 03:16:07.400]  based report he put out as a publicity stunt but he in the la
[03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:09.960]  times alexander cockman was the one who exposed
[03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:14.440]  at the la times god rest his soul recently passed i believe i read that i
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:16.840]  mean double check that my memory fails the point is
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:22.120]  he wrote about it was declassified theodore kaczynski was in the m k old for
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:25.960]  mind control program he went in to a psychologist
[03:16:25.960 --> 03:16:29.960]  psychiatrist and they drugged him he disappeared into the program for
[03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:33.400]  years comes out but the media says there's no connection
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:37.400]  to his unibombing there you don't just have m k ultra shooters
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:43.800]  you've got m k ultra bombers that's right people disappear they come back
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:48.280]  oh yes i was in this program yes i went to see a psychiatrist this is what
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:51.960]  happened and so on and so forth and the public doesn't want to believe
[03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:55.160]  this you see but this is what you have to look at and
[03:16:55.160 --> 03:16:58.840]  understand and by the way here's the headline we're reaping tragic legacy
[03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:04.040]  from drugs the government lsd experiments to uh over uh use of drugs
[03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:06.680]  like ritalin the consequences are overwhelming and
[03:17:06.680 --> 03:17:09.240]  is that the one that's got the uh yeah there it is theodore kaczynski
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:14.200]  was in a cia harvard mk ultra mind control experiments la
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:16.520]  times but i was saying double check is i think
[03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:19.640]  alexander cockburn passed recently i think i know he did i want to double
[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:24.120]  check that uh go ahead uh there john yeah so you've
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:28.120]  got this kind of a program that spreads out tentacles all over the country
[03:17:28.120 --> 03:17:31.240]  and as i was saying in 1995 all of a sudden
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:35.880]  you had two women testifying before the president's committee on radiation
[03:17:35.880 --> 03:17:38.760]  experiments saying yeah but that was just a small part of
[03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:42.120]  what we were into since the time we were children we were
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:48.280]  basically tortured by army doctors cia doctors in a mind control program
[03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:53.400]  that radiation was just a small part of and the idea was they wanted to make us
[03:17:53.400 --> 03:17:58.840]  into sex agents and assassins and this is taking place in a committee room in
[03:17:58.840 --> 03:18:03.560]  washington dc before a panel and an audience in the
[03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:09.880]  room and they get through testifying and the panel is absolutely silent
[03:18:09.880 --> 03:18:13.400]  and then one person says well thank you very much next witness will please come
[03:18:13.400 --> 03:18:16.200]  up as if nothing ever happened and as these
[03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:21.720]  two witnesses walk back from testifying people in the audience
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:26.920]  get up and go over to them and say thank god you said something because
[03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:31.320]  i was here to talk about radiation too but the same thing happened to me that
[03:18:31.320 --> 03:18:34.520]  happened to you and the truth is people ask where's the
[03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:38.520]  new order going it's the trip not the destination the
[03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:41.000]  destination is kill everybody because that's their dream
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:44.760]  then they use a cosmetic environmental excuse they all
[03:18:44.760 --> 03:18:48.280]  like raping little children and stuff and so they do it under national
[03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:52.680]  security or some of them like killing kids you know like
[03:18:52.680 --> 03:18:55.560]  joseph mingola would take kids out almost every day give them chocolate
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:58.280]  bars and shoot them in the head because he said he liked to watch the
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:01.320]  bouts of blood out the top of their head he didn't like to rape them he liked to
[03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:04.600]  torture them it's about the the fact that they're now going to do
[03:19:04.600 --> 03:19:09.880]  anthrax vaccine on children i mean this to me is like yeah we want to
[03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:12.840]  destroy children and kill children because we like to do it
[03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:15.560]  and they admit it killed large numbers of our troops totally deadly and they're
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:18.360]  going to get us used to killing our kids right there a lot of them will die
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:21.800]  there's no other possible reason that they're that they're going to test this
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:25.480]  anthrax vaccine on kids because they know it's completely
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:28.680]  destructive and toxic they know kids have nothing to do with
[03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:33.880]  any sort of national security baloney they're doing it because they want to do
[03:19:33.880 --> 03:19:37.400]  it yeah we want to do it we want to give this to kids
[03:19:37.400 --> 03:19:42.040]  to torture them and to destroy it is such a fun thing for them to
[03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:44.680]  exactly because they admit they don't want to kill you quickly there's nothing
[03:19:44.680 --> 03:19:47.480]  more beautiful than them a child having debilitating stuff for
[03:19:47.480 --> 03:19:50.600]  like 20 years and then dying horrible deaths i mean that is just a beautiful
[03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:53.640]  thing the worse the cancer the more horrible
[03:19:53.640 --> 03:19:57.320]  the more debilitating hurting little children it's so beautiful to them and

[03:24:05.320 --> 03:24:09.160]  all right people are really getting what i'm saying with obama now
[03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:13.400]  global head of al-qaeda will president order drone strikes on the white house
[03:24:13.400 --> 03:24:16.440]  on himself like eagle eye where the computer is
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:19.240]  told go after you know criminals and so it goes after the government because it
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:23.080]  says the government is criminal now again i'm saying we're battling
[03:24:23.080 --> 03:24:27.160]  absurdity with absurdity we're not manufacturing the absurdity
[03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:31.080]  we are actually showing the absurdity because he is
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:36.760]  supposedly the head of the u.s military and then that really controls nato
[03:24:36.760 --> 03:24:41.080]  and has the you know dominant voting in that and it's running al-qaeda in libya
[03:24:41.080 --> 03:24:44.040]  and syria publicly and now mohammed karzai's come out that they're running
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:47.240]  it in afghanistan all these other places that's
[03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:51.720]  that's there so he is the head of al-qaeda the titular head bare minimum
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:54.920]  and so my point is it shows they're running al-qaeda
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:57.320]  but they're saying they can kill americans anytime they want with that
[03:24:57.320 --> 03:24:59.960]  precedent if they think you're even connected to
[03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:03.240]  a group that might be connected but you know three layers of separation
[03:25:03.240 --> 03:25:07.480]  to al-qaeda and and it's just a joke so we're calling their hoax
[03:25:07.480 --> 03:25:10.680]  other media is like why does our government give missiles to al-qaeda and
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:13.160]  run them and let them travel around and why did the head of
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:17.400]  number two in al-qaeda meet secretly at the pentagon amarala laki fox news
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:21.560]  and then no one calls it for what it is i'm calling it for what it is
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:25.560]  the and it's absurd it is absurd that the government runs
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:28.520]  al-qaeda it is absurd that if they were really
[03:25:28.520 --> 03:25:31.880]  fighting al-qaeda they would call drone strikes on themselves
[03:25:31.880 --> 03:25:34.520]  which they're puppets as well i hope that doesn't happen we wish them long
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:36.840]  lives in prison the point is is that i know the white
[03:25:36.840 --> 03:25:39.160]  house listens media matters listens they're on record they do
[03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:42.840]  they they respond to us because no one else out there at this level
[03:25:42.840 --> 03:25:45.720]  is calling them out let me close with this john rapid port of no more fake
[03:25:45.720 --> 03:25:48.040]  news.com you're a smart guy you know your
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:51.160]  history why do you think i'm still on the air why do you think you're able to
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:54.680]  do what you do and and what do you think of my point i
[03:25:54.680 --> 03:25:58.360]  just make is i saw some commenter saying alex has joined them saying fight
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:03.480]  absurdity with absurdity no no no i am stating how absurd it is not not
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:06.920]  making stuff up i am equalizing it saying this is what
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:10.040]  it really is isn't that absurd uh can you talk about
[03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:13.640]  the subtleties of that or why we're still alive
[03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:17.480]  well i think we're still alive because there are a lot of people that are
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:20.360]  listening and it would be a little bit maybe
[03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:25.000]  crossing over the line to try to uh you know eliminate that
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.400]  voice i mean i don't know how many million people are
[03:26:27.400 --> 03:26:31.080]  listening to this thing right now we're going to tap into it in the next few
[03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:34.120]  days because you're making the point all the
[03:26:34.120 --> 03:26:37.800]  way alex that's the thing you see you're not saying well i think i've got
[03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:41.160]  a story and it's really big and i'm going to break it in six weeks and
[03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:44.680]  no it's right now in your face totally in fact
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:48.120]  i think that nbc should put you on to replace jay leno
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:52.200]  and i'll be your sidekick i'll be ready and we'll sit there and you say
[03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:56.520]  hey cindy you're you're now 15 years old and you sold 12 billion records already
[03:26:56.520 --> 03:27:00.040]  as a pop singer tell me were you part of the cia mind control
[03:27:00.040 --> 03:27:02.920]  program oh alex of course i was let me tell you
[03:27:02.920 --> 03:27:06.200]  about what happened to me in virginia we'll go on and do this stuff every
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:12.280]  night on a tonight show and then we'll really see what happens
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:18.040]  because the fraud see people say that patriots bring them into alison wonder
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:20.200]  land that we take them down the rabbit hole
[03:27:20.200 --> 03:27:22.280]  john aren't we trying to take people out of the
[03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:25.560]  alison wonderland out of the rabbit hole yeah you see
[03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:29.000]  here's the operation you tie ropes around their ankles
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:32.200]  and you lower them all the way down to the rabbit hole
[03:27:32.200 --> 03:27:36.040]  and then you say see and then you bring them back up again that's what we're
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:38.520]  doing oh that's even better than what i was
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:42.200]  saying getting exactly you've got a well basically you're already in alison
[03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:45.800]  wonderland we've got to get the blinders off so they see it
[03:27:45.800 --> 03:27:49.320]  that's right take the blinders off look where we are
[03:27:49.320 --> 03:27:52.440]  this is wonderland there's a mad hatter over there
[03:27:52.440 --> 03:27:55.960]  and so on and so they're all here you know
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:58.520]  they're all sitting you know i agree with you though you wrote an article
[03:27:58.520 --> 03:28:01.800]  after my pierce morgan and and i think you're dead on you weren't just
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:06.920]  saying that it shook them because it it went all the way it just called the
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:11.160]  little man behind the curtain there you go this is the thing you see
[03:28:11.160 --> 03:28:15.160]  people some people would say no no when alex was on the pierce you see he
[03:28:15.160 --> 03:28:18.680]  should have presented point one two three four five six oh
[03:28:18.680 --> 03:28:22.360]  this is why guns are okay whatever no that's just playing right into their
[03:28:22.360 --> 03:28:25.880]  hands don't you get it people i mean come on
[03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:29.720]  so alex goes on and pierce says okay now tonight we're
[03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:33.880]  going to and that's all that's all folks he was finished because
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:39.320]  alex jumped all over him bang that's what you do you don't go

[03:33:15.160 --> 03:33:20.600]  before sitting in for alex jones on the alex jones show for the last half hour
[03:33:20.600 --> 03:33:23.880]  i think alex is going to go off to nbc and
[03:33:23.880 --> 03:33:29.480]  work the tonight show tonight because obviously to getting rid of jay leno
[03:33:29.480 --> 03:33:32.600]  they don't need them anymore what we need is the truth
[03:33:32.600 --> 03:33:36.120]  and that's what alex and i touched on in the last segment here
[03:33:36.120 --> 03:33:39.480]  and i want to just blast this home further
[03:33:39.480 --> 03:33:45.960]  the point is if you go halfway you lose that's why when he went on with pierce
[03:33:45.960 --> 03:33:50.920]  morgan and just got completely into his face
[03:33:50.920 --> 03:33:54.920]  it broke that hypnotic spell that everybody's used to when they're watching
[03:33:54.920 --> 03:33:58.120]  television oh this is very civilized and yes we have
[03:33:58.120 --> 03:34:02.280]  these people over here and oh george stephanopoulos disagrees with
[03:34:02.280 --> 03:34:06.600]  chris matthew oh yes and you know this is all
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:11.160]  the charade this is all the puppet show this is all for the purpose of mind
[03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:15.640]  control mind control through information to get
[03:34:15.640 --> 03:34:19.880]  you to accept the idea that brian williams
[03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:24.920]  you know knows more about reality than we could possibly imagine therefore we
[03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:30.040]  have to tune into him every night and go into a state of trance as he
[03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:35.160]  tells us what's happening on the news so what alex is saying is no you go all
[03:34:35.160 --> 03:34:39.640]  the way when you tell the truth because they're
[03:34:39.640 --> 03:34:43.880]  lying all the way the globalists don't want just half the
[03:34:43.880 --> 03:34:47.400]  planet they want everything and that's what they're going for
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:51.560]  what do you think mind control programs that the cia have been running for years
[03:34:51.560 --> 03:34:55.080]  are all about it's to totally destroy the individual
[03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:58.920]  human being and remake the human being that's what
[03:34:58.920 --> 03:35:02.920]  they're trying to do it's not oh let's just shift a few little things
[03:35:02.920 --> 03:35:05.880]  here let me just fill you in on a couple things we talked
[03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:09.800]  about you and cameron the canadian researcher who is the head
[03:35:09.800 --> 03:35:14.480]  of the world psychiatric society decorated from here to the moon in the
[03:35:14.480 --> 03:35:19.000]  1950s and was remaking
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  people's personalities as patients whether they liked it or not
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:26.600]  they would just come into his office and all of a sudden they would be enrolled
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:31.560]  in a couple of month-long program put them to sleep for 20 or 30 days on
[03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:36.120]  end with nembutal thorazine compounds like that which are brain
[03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:39.400]  destroying wake them up in the middle of the night
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:43.560]  give them incredibly heavy shock treatments at 20 to 40 times the
[03:35:43.560 --> 03:35:46.280]  strength of ordinary shock treatments which are already
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:49.480]  tortured this is torture by the way nothing else
[03:35:49.480 --> 03:35:54.360]  and then he would subject them to 12 to 16 hours a day day after day
[03:35:54.360 --> 03:36:00.280]  of his audio tapes instructing them on what person they were going to be now
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:03.800]  you are this is important this is what you're going to be
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:08.280]  the man was making over a human being into a machine
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:14.440]  destroying human lives eventually suits were filed years and years later
[03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:19.480]  cia was implicated admitted it paid out of pittance
[03:36:19.480 --> 03:36:25.080]  this is just a peek into what the real purpose of the mind control program is
[03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:27.480]  you see they're going all the way that's my
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:30.520]  point if they're going all the way we have to
[03:36:30.520 --> 03:36:36.040]  go all the way absolutely and that's why alex is
[03:36:36.040 --> 03:36:40.040]  extraordinarily successful in what he's doing because he's going all the way
[03:36:40.040 --> 03:36:46.440]  as a human being so why can't you why can't i why can't anybody go all the
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:51.640]  way with what the truth of the situation is it was jose delgado a yale
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:55.640]  researcher oh very very exclusive elite researcher
[03:36:55.640 --> 03:37:01.560]  who said in the 1950s the human being does not have an inherent
[03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:06.360]  right to his own personality
[03:37:06.360 --> 03:37:09.400]  what do you think these people are doing with
[03:37:09.400 --> 03:37:15.000]  technocracy and the whole mind brain interface oh yes we're going to hook you
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:18.280]  up to machines and computers and life is going to be completely
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:21.960]  different in the next coming 10 20 years because these
[03:37:21.960 --> 03:37:25.480]  computers are going to be able to do more than the brain could
[03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:29.320]  ever do before and we're going to have a human machine
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:34.520]  future they want to totally remake over the human being
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:38.520]  into a slave into a machine that's what it's all about
[03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:42.200]  they can say it's not they can say it's this it's that but that's where the
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:46.680]  program is going they're going all the way so
[03:37:46.680 --> 03:37:52.920]  what about you and telling the truth is it better to just say well you see
[03:37:52.920 --> 03:37:58.040]  it's quite possible that they may have made an error in their calculation about
[03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:00.760]  the following
[03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:06.360]  are we going to just keep carrying on a conversation at that level
[03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:11.240]  when the truth is right there for anybody who wants to see it and say it
[03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:18.920]  and put it out there put it out there don't stink don't hold yourself back
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:22.120]  what's happening now in america with money with the
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:25.560]  economic collapse which is being lied about
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:29.960]  has been documented on info wars from one end to the other about
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:33.320]  employment figures oh yes well we're making a strong comeback here no we're
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:38.120]  not making a strong comeback here not making a strong comeback at all the
[03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:40.920]  people who have been put out of work are stopping
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:43.960]  to look for work or they're getting low paying jobs
[03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:48.360]  just anything to survive it was destruction by plan
[03:38:48.360 --> 03:38:53.240]  to torpedo the economies of the world worse than they're already being
[03:38:53.240 --> 03:38:56.680]  torpedoed to go all the way and destroy these
[03:38:56.680 --> 03:39:00.920]  economies to steal all your money and then to say
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:04.840]  well you're angry about that really we have
[03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:09.800]  to declare martial law we have to put in a state of emergency i
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:13.000]  mean we're doing the best we can to reignite
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:16.600]  the economy in the coming months etc etc etc
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:20.280]  lying lying lying lying lying lying lying lying
[03:39:20.280 --> 03:39:24.600]  the operation the globalist operation is to destroy
[03:39:24.600 --> 03:39:28.920]  economies of every nation to put them all the way under
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:33.480]  and to rebuild a cashless digitized money system
[03:39:33.480 --> 03:39:39.720]  from the ground up based on the lie that it is somehow more humane and fair
[03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:44.840]  and just and humanitarian and uh you know all of that for the
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:48.120]  population that we redo the whole money system because
[03:39:48.120 --> 03:39:51.720]  we don't have any social justice no social
[03:39:51.720 --> 03:39:55.640]  justice with the present money system we're going to have to redo it all
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:40:00.840]  that's where they're going and then as alex has been talking about as i've been
[03:40:00.840 --> 03:40:03.000]  talking about others have been talking about
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:07.720]  every single transaction in the world will be
[03:40:07.720 --> 03:40:11.960]  tracked and followed by their machines and equipment oh
[03:40:11.960 --> 03:40:17.000]  the wonderful new computers we have we've built in algorithms that will
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.720]  monitor the cashless money system of the planet
[03:40:21.720 --> 03:40:25.800]  is that going all the way you bet it's going all the way every single
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:29.640]  purchase transaction will be tracked in real time
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:34.680]  and taxed in real time you don't have any choice about what you pay what they
[03:40:34.680 --> 03:40:38.440]  steal from you that's where they're heading with this
[03:40:38.440 --> 03:40:42.200]  and as my good friend catherine austin fifth said this is what they'll hide
[03:40:42.200 --> 03:40:46.120]  behind the algorithm well we've all put it on
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:49.560]  the computer now we have the model and the algorithm and this is the way the
[03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:54.520]  new money system is going to work and so that's just the way it is it's the best
[03:40:54.520 --> 03:40:58.680]  there is we don't blame us it's the computers yeah
[03:40:58.680 --> 03:41:02.280]  sure sure sure it is that's where they're
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:05.880]  heading with this the science fiction that we all thought
[03:41:05.880 --> 03:41:11.560]  about 20 years ago is here now you see it's here now
[03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:15.000]  and so that's why the response that we have to make it
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:22.760]  to it is all out all the time say it all speak the whole truth the
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:27.240]  whole truth about mind control where it was really
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:32.280]  born how it really worked how in the united states
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:40.120]  in the 1940s check this out okay tune it up the brain in the 1940s
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:45.080]  if you were a mental patient in a california state hospital
[03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:48.440]  you could not be discharged from that hospital until
[03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:56.360]  you were sterilized sterilized that's right
[03:41:56.360 --> 03:42:00.200]  the americans were into the eugenics program
[03:42:00.200 --> 03:42:04.920]  before the nazis were people like paul pocono
[03:42:04.920 --> 03:42:09.480]  they were doing all kinds of things to sterilize people
[03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:13.080]  as detailed by another great friend of mine
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:20.040]  and fantastic hero dr peter bragan the whole point of
[03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:25.480]  the american psychiatric association in the 1940s in america early 1940s was to
[03:42:25.480 --> 03:42:30.360]  have a debate about whether the mentally retarded
[03:42:30.360 --> 03:42:34.200]  in quotes you know the mentally deficient
[03:42:34.200 --> 03:42:41.880]  should be get it sterilized or killed that was the debate it was a big debate
[03:42:41.880 --> 03:42:45.080]  carried out on the pages of their professional
[03:42:45.080 --> 03:42:50.680]  journal and eventually in an editorial written in 1942
[03:42:50.680 --> 03:42:54.040]  in the american psychiatric association journal the decision
[03:42:54.040 --> 03:43:00.360]  was killer mentally deficient killing do you think
[03:43:00.360 --> 03:43:05.000]  that's going all the way oh yeah do you think they just abandoned this
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:10.360]  whole idea of control oh we're not going to do that anymore
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:12.440]  no the only thing that's changed is the pr
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:16.280]  the pr has gotten better that's all it's just as destructive now as it was
[03:43:16.280 --> 03:43:21.000]  then in 1942 they said the american
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:25.080]  psychiatric psychiatric association kill all
[03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:29.640]  mentally deficient children in america that's our policy
[03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:34.760]  and you psychiatrists and i'm paraphrasing from the editorial
[03:43:34.760 --> 03:43:39.560]  are going to have to use your psychological skills in talking to the
[03:43:39.560 --> 03:43:43.880]  parents of the children that are going to be killed to convince
[03:43:43.880 --> 03:43:47.480]  them that it's really in their best interest in the best interest of their
[03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:50.920]  child to be murdered
[03:43:51.240 --> 03:43:56.840]  that's the legacy folks that's the legacy that we're dealing with
[03:43:56.840 --> 03:43:59.880]  and that legacy is not stopped it's continued the history
[03:43:59.880 --> 03:44:03.240]  is continuous it's gone on from that point
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:06.600]  right up till the present the only thing that's changed is
[03:44:06.600 --> 03:44:10.600]  pharmaceutical companies say we love you we wouldn't do anything to hurt you
[03:44:10.600 --> 03:44:14.440]  and neither would the psychiatrist oh we care and we share and it's all
[03:44:14.440 --> 03:44:17.560]  wonderful and this is why obama is now going to
[03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:22.360]  expand community mental health services all over america in the wake of the
[03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:26.600]  sandy hook shootings oh yes we have to stop the next one and so
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:29.800]  here's what we're going to do we're going to have all more and more
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:33.560]  and more people sent to psychiatrists people that we
[03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:37.800]  say oh their behavior is a little odd so no we don't like what they said oh
[03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:41.720]  you said that oh facebook blocked that oh heavens to bestie
[03:44:41.720 --> 03:44:45.800]  go to see a psychiatrist get a diagnosis of a mental disorder
[03:44:45.800 --> 03:44:50.040]  take a drug that will rip your brain circuits apart
[03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:53.720]  and we'll call this healing and a cure and we'll say
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:58.520]  that you are now no longer a danger to the community
[03:44:58.520 --> 03:45:04.520]  and isn't it wonderful let's just get down in our hands and knees
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:12.360]  and pray and thank to these people who are watching over us
[03:45:12.360 --> 03:45:17.960]  yeah they're going all the way so we have to go all the way and tell
[03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:22.040]  them the truth about what they're really doing
[03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:28.040]  it's mind control folks from one end to the other that's what's down the
[03:45:28.040 --> 03:45:31.560]  rabbit hole and waking up from that and seeing it
[03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:36.600]  and saying no that's the whole point
[03:45:36.600 --> 03:45:41.560]  because waking up is contagious too just like going under a trance is
[03:45:41.560 --> 03:45:44.760]  contagious you get sleepwalkers on the street and
[03:45:44.760 --> 03:45:47.720]  after a while your person looks around and says well maybe
[03:45:47.720 --> 03:45:50.760]  that's a normal maybe that's what i should do no but
[03:45:50.760 --> 03:45:54.280]  when people start waking up you begin to say well maybe that's what i should do
[03:45:54.280 --> 03:45:57.960]  too you bet go do the research for yourself
[03:45:57.960 --> 03:46:02.600]  look up the frank church hearings in the 1970s in congress
[03:46:02.600 --> 03:46:07.480]  only one small little slice of what mk ultra was all about
[03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:11.480]  one little slice and it was exposed at that time
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:15.000]  go look at the history of ewen cameron in canada
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:19.800]  jose delgado the yale researcher go look at all of that stuff
[03:46:19.800 --> 03:46:23.320]  and check it out for yourself and you'll see
[03:46:23.320 --> 03:46:27.880]  google in sometime documents mk ultra and see what you can come up with
[03:46:27.880 --> 03:46:34.040]  read john marx book search for the mangerian candidate read
[03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:37.800]  walter bauer's book operation mind control read alan
[03:46:37.800 --> 03:46:42.440]  shefland's book the mind manipulators when i interviewed john marx in the
[03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:47.960]  early 1990s he said to me do you want to know how i
[03:46:47.960 --> 03:46:52.280]  got to be able to write the book that exposed mk ultra because that was
[03:46:52.280 --> 03:46:56.280]  really the book that did it i said yeah i really would i mean how
[03:46:56.280 --> 03:46:59.240]  did you get the information he said well i was sending in foyer
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:03.480]  requests for years to the cia and they were denying me every time and
[03:47:03.480 --> 03:47:09.000]  then somebody finally as a joke sent me some financial records from mk
[03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:12.840]  ultra projects at the cia like hey let's see what this guy will do
[03:47:12.840 --> 03:47:15.240]  with that
[03:47:15.240 --> 03:47:19.240]  but marx is a very smart guy and so he went to work on these records
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:23.880]  and he found that he could begin to work out through the funding mechanisms
[03:47:23.880 --> 03:47:27.240]  what the project's really all about and who was involved
[03:47:27.240 --> 03:47:32.600]  the researchers the scientists the mad lunatic doctors and psychiatrists
[03:47:32.600 --> 03:47:36.760]  and then he began to do interviews and he pieced the whole thing together
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:41.880]  and he wrote the book and those other two books that i mentioned were also
[03:47:41.880 --> 03:47:46.280]  basically stemmed from those 10 boxes
[03:47:46.280 --> 03:47:50.680]  of financial records that the cia finally sent
[03:47:50.680 --> 03:47:57.320]  to john marx as a joke see so marx went back he went back to the
[03:47:57.320 --> 03:48:00.600]  cia and he said okay boys i want some more i'm going to file some more
[03:48:00.600 --> 03:48:04.120]  requests and here this is what marx told me this
[03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:09.720]  is almost verbatim they said to him in 1962
[03:48:09.720 --> 03:48:14.280]  the mind control program the cia mk ultra was shifted over
[03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:17.720]  to a different department at the cia called the office
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:21.800]  of research and development ord that's where all the
[03:48:21.800 --> 03:48:25.960]  secret research has been going on since then and now
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:30.840]  they were taunting marx we've got a hundred boxes of information and guess
[03:48:30.840 --> 03:48:34.520]  what marx you're never ever going to get your
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:37.720]  hands on them you can file as many foyer requests as
[03:48:37.720 --> 03:48:42.520]  you want you're never going to get one iota of that information ever again
[03:48:42.520 --> 03:48:49.800]  why because what we're doing now what what it's more secret than ever
[03:48:49.800 --> 03:48:54.120]  therefore it's more destructive than ever therefore it's more effective than
[03:48:54.120 --> 03:48:57.080]  ever at being mind control that's what the
[03:48:57.080 --> 03:49:00.320]  cia was all about that's what it became
[03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:03.560]  instantaneously as soon as it was created
[03:49:03.560 --> 03:49:09.800]  it's the mind control agency and that's what's happening all across
[03:49:09.800 --> 03:49:13.000]  america so it's very easy to tell the american
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:16.200]  people well see i al-qaeda is this thing out
[03:49:16.200 --> 03:49:19.560]  there way out there i mean we don't even know how to spell
[03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:24.840]  it right is it a-l-q-u is it a-l-q-a-i
[03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:28.760]  who knows you know we don't know what any of those names mean it's way out
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:32.600]  there somewhere they do all the damage on the planet and
[03:49:32.600 --> 03:49:36.120]  then every time something bad happens they're responsible only thing
[03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:42.440]  is hahaha we're funding it and we created it
[03:49:42.440 --> 03:49:46.280]  we created part of it during the afghan war way back there remember
[03:49:46.280 --> 03:49:50.680]  uh you know uh yeah i remember back in the 80s that's right
[03:49:50.680 --> 03:49:54.200]  and we expanded and we continue to create it because
[03:49:54.200 --> 03:49:58.360]  it's a good proxy for us we can stage revolutions with it
[03:49:58.360 --> 03:50:04.680]  we can hire these thugs and people uh paying money and some actual you know
[03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:09.080]  down to earth terrorists but they're working for us
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:14.120]  that's what al-qaeda is and that's why alex ran
[03:50:14.120 --> 03:50:17.400]  the headline obama is the head of al-qaeda
[03:50:17.400 --> 03:50:22.120]  because through various cutouts like dado and the u.s military and so forth
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:26.760]  where do you think the funding is coming from it's coming from here
[03:50:26.760 --> 03:50:33.400]  it's coming from us it's coming from other places like us too
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:37.960]  to keep the pot boiling to destabilize other countries
[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:44.840]  to destroy other economies to bring in even worse governments than those
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:47.960]  countries now governments that are more under our
[03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:51.400]  control that are following our agenda which is
[03:50:51.400 --> 03:50:56.760]  ultimate

[03:54:46.840 --> 03:54:51.880]  to have a discussion about gun control but it didn't turn out to be quite what
[03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:57.080]  cnn thought it was going to be it was as if
[03:54:57.080 --> 03:55:01.800]  follow me here it was as if some guy walked onto the set
[03:55:01.800 --> 03:55:05.400]  and put his hand out and tore down one of the walls
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:09.880]  thus exposing the control room and the cameras and the people standing around
[03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:13.320]  drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes then he went over he tore down another
[03:55:13.320 --> 03:55:16.120]  wall and then you saw office with some people

[03:55:25.240 --> 03:55:30.600]  that's what you have to understand that if you're going to go up against the
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:35.480]  mind controllers and the media are right in there with the cia in their
[03:55:35.480 --> 03:55:38.520]  own way on the whole program of mind control

[03:55:43.240 --> 03:55:49.080]  against those people you have to destroy the illusion
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:52.600]  well that's oh we'd like to have a dialogue would you sit down by
