[00:00.000 --> 00:10.500]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.500 --> 00:17.500]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:17.500 --> 00:42.700]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:42.700 --> 00:47.940]  The transhumanists, the singularitarians, believe that this is the end of history that
[00:47.940 --> 00:55.380]  we're approaching and that they are in full control of humanity's mind and soul and genetics
[00:55.380 --> 00:57.420]  and developmental future.
[00:57.420 --> 01:04.780]  The current, quote, COVID jabs connect into this very much, seriously much.
[01:04.780 --> 01:14.460]  So does transgenderism and this explosion of focus upon it in recent times where it
[01:14.460 --> 01:17.100]  came out of nowhere and suddenly everywhere.
[01:17.100 --> 01:25.540]  The sperm counts that are plummeting catastrophically around the world come into this and you put
[01:25.540 --> 01:32.060]  it all together and what is going on, and I've been writing about this for a long time,
[01:32.060 --> 01:38.540]  is that what you might call human 1.0, the biological human that we know is in the process
[01:38.540 --> 01:47.420]  of being replaced unless we intervene by human 2.0, which is a much more synthetic version
[01:47.420 --> 01:54.300]  of human, very much concerned with connecting the human brain, the human body to artificial
[01:54.300 --> 01:55.820]  intelligence.
[01:55.820 --> 01:59.060]  So artificial intelligence becomes the human mind.
[01:59.060 --> 02:07.740]  Up to this point, they've had to control the mass population by control of perception
[02:07.740 --> 02:14.460]  through control of information and suppression of other information, but with the plan to
[02:14.460 --> 02:20.700]  connect the human brain to AI, the perceptions of humans are planned to come direct.
[02:20.700 --> 02:26.300]  No manipulation of information necessary because you'll get your opinions direct.
[02:26.300 --> 02:31.740]  And so you've got two things going on at the same time, which you would have in the situation
[02:31.740 --> 02:36.140]  I've just described, and the reason they're attacking the men and attacking the women and
[02:36.140 --> 02:44.620]  transgender is everything, is because the human 2.0 is not meant to procreate.
[02:44.620 --> 02:52.860]  The species is meant to be in the words of Aldous Huxley in Brave New World in 1932 decanted
[02:52.860 --> 02:59.580]  technologically and basically produced in a laboratory setting.
[02:59.580 --> 03:05.140]  And the technology that he described in Brave New World in 1932 is now being developed, is
[03:05.140 --> 03:08.020]  now being produced and played out.
[03:08.020 --> 03:12.060]  So you don't need men and women anymore in this Brave New World of what I call the global
[03:12.060 --> 03:14.380]  cult is behind all this.
[03:14.380 --> 03:21.060]  And this transgender explosion is not actually about transgender.
[03:21.060 --> 03:24.540]  The vast majority of people in that movement will think it's about them, they'll think
[03:24.540 --> 03:25.780]  it's about transgender.
[03:25.780 --> 03:26.780]  It's not.
[03:26.780 --> 03:32.100]  And the key activists driving this will know that it's not about transgender, it's about
[03:32.100 --> 03:37.660]  no gender, the no gender human, human 2.0.
[03:37.660 --> 03:42.740]  And they just want to be able to mold the brains of the people to accept this nightmare
[03:42.740 --> 03:45.260]  future and to not resist it.
[03:45.260 --> 03:50.460]  Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm going to resist it, a lie doesn't become truth,
[03:50.460 --> 03:54.060]  wrong doesn't become right, evil doesn't become good.
[03:54.060 --> 03:59.500]  Just because it's accepted by a majority and it's not been accepted by a majority wrong
[03:59.500 --> 04:01.300]  has not been accepted.
[04:01.300 --> 04:06.340]  Federal Court of Appeals temporarily blocks Biden's vaccine mandate.
[04:06.340 --> 04:10.740]  I was going to title the show the permanent emergency of the term permanent emergency
[04:10.740 --> 04:19.700]  is very important, understand the rest of your life because fighting the great reset
[04:19.700 --> 04:22.900]  and the permanent emergency is the rest of your life.
[04:22.900 --> 04:27.940]  It's the number one thing governing you on this planet and your body and your health
[04:27.940 --> 04:32.660]  and your future and your money and your right to live your life as you see fit because the
[04:32.660 --> 04:37.820]  good times, ladies and gentlemen, are gone.
[04:37.820 --> 04:48.220]  All right, folks, it's Tuesday, November 16, 2021, and we have got another incredible
[04:48.220 --> 04:53.460]  transmission lined up for you and it all kicks off in T minus 60 seconds, a bunch of
[04:53.460 --> 04:59.460]  surprise guests, it's just all over the top every second is precious.
[04:59.460 --> 05:03.940]  When it comes to regaining, so when I first started taking survival skills, basically
[05:03.940 --> 05:09.340]  I was 275 pounds overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding
[05:09.340 --> 05:13.420]  on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[05:13.420 --> 05:18.060]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[05:18.060 --> 05:21.940]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that, you know, with a deep burn source,
[05:21.940 --> 05:23.380]  you know, and I got really excited about that.
[05:23.380 --> 05:28.420]  So I took it and then in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my
[05:28.420 --> 05:33.780]  brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people again and
[05:33.780 --> 05:38.540]  over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take
[05:38.540 --> 05:40.260]  basically all of your supplements.
[05:40.260 --> 05:42.260]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[05:42.260 --> 05:46.580]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[05:46.580 --> 05:47.580]  It's amazing.
[05:47.580 --> 05:51.740]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[05:51.740 --> 05:55.900]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own
[05:55.900 --> 05:56.900]  hand.
[05:56.900 --> 05:57.900]  Beautifully said, brother.
[05:57.900 --> 06:21.380]  Thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[06:21.380 --> 06:24.860]  Well to say there's a quickening happening on this planet is an understatement.
[06:24.860 --> 06:31.540]  Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday, November 16th worldwide broadcast.
[06:31.540 --> 06:35.460]  Martial law is being rolled out across the planet.
[06:35.460 --> 06:38.020]  They never eased off in Australia.
[06:38.020 --> 06:41.060]  They only kept intensifying that was a beta test in Europe.
[06:41.060 --> 06:45.820]  They claimed they were going to back off the martial law, but they actually are accelerating
[06:45.820 --> 06:51.860]  that and announcing that if you want to be able to leave your house or have a job or
[06:51.860 --> 07:01.460]  travel in Europe, in the UK, in Australia, in Canada, you have to have the injections.
[07:01.460 --> 07:09.060]  And it's the same thing now in blue cities like New York and of course states like California.
[07:09.060 --> 07:14.540]  There's a London Guardian headline number 10 plans booster jab required for people to
[07:14.540 --> 07:17.620]  obtain COVID pass.
[07:17.620 --> 07:22.700]  Boris Johnson will play that clip here in a moment just came out yesterday and said things
[07:22.700 --> 07:25.940]  aren't going to be too easy on you if you don't do it.
[07:25.940 --> 07:27.260]  Same thing they're saying in Australia.
[07:27.260 --> 07:35.100]  It's all a incredibly evil unified tyranny for the world ID, the world social credit
[07:35.100 --> 07:36.100]  score.
[07:36.100 --> 07:38.740]  But more than that, I've got the reports right here.
[07:38.740 --> 07:44.780]  More than 200 prominent soccer players in the European leagues have had heart attacks
[07:44.780 --> 07:48.820]  and microcarditis and quite a few have died.
[07:48.820 --> 07:52.940]  Same thing for tennis players, same thing for hockey players over here.
[07:52.940 --> 07:56.900]  This is a real crisis.
[07:56.900 --> 07:58.580]  We've not seen those same statistics.
[07:58.580 --> 08:02.100]  We've seen an uptake but nothing like it in the United States.
[08:02.100 --> 08:10.620]  And I've talked to a lot of professional athletes off record, both in MMA and the NFL.
[08:10.620 --> 08:13.300]  And I can tell you that their doctors are not giving it to them.
[08:13.300 --> 08:15.700]  They're just saying they've had it.
[08:15.700 --> 08:20.820]  And it's better to speak out and say no to it than do that because later they're going
[08:20.820 --> 08:25.380]  to have vaccine blood tests, which they're already rolling out, to try to force you and
[08:25.380 --> 08:26.380]  make sure you've done it.
[08:26.380 --> 08:33.420]  But yes, over a 60 times increase in pro sports adverse events since vaccines rolled out.
[08:33.420 --> 08:43.420]  An investigative journalist and billion dollar company tech guru, Steve Kersh will be joining
[08:43.420 --> 08:49.140]  us to talk about some of those incredible numbers in the third hour today.
[08:49.140 --> 08:54.100]  Tim Poole is going to be on with us on Thursday now, but I'm going to be on with Tim Poole
[08:54.100 --> 09:00.180]  tonight for probably three, four hours on his show with some other Austin surprise guests.
[09:00.180 --> 09:08.740]  I'll just leave that up to you to guess, but it'll be a big internet event tonight at around
[09:08.740 --> 09:09.940]  seven o'clock central.
[09:09.940 --> 09:10.940]  So look for that.
[09:10.940 --> 09:18.180]  But let me tell you what's really huge and got me having butterflies right now.
[09:18.180 --> 09:21.100]  And I don't get butterflies a lot and having really big ones today.
[09:21.100 --> 09:26.260]  I think a big wars about to start something big is about to go down.
[09:26.260 --> 09:28.940]  My spidey sense has never been this strong.
[09:28.940 --> 09:32.060]  It's like on fire right now.
[09:32.060 --> 09:34.060]  Woo.
[09:34.060 --> 09:35.140]  Talk about chills.
[09:35.140 --> 09:39.780]  Talk about the stomach.
[09:39.780 --> 09:44.700]  Man, that is some, that is some energy right there.
[09:44.700 --> 09:49.700]  There's some big stuff, you know, China's threatened war with the United States.
[09:49.700 --> 09:53.740]  The CIA says Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine, which I don't believe a word they
[09:53.740 --> 09:59.860]  say, but who knows Putin saying that we need to fight a global satanic takeover.
[09:59.860 --> 10:05.860]  I mean, we are living in the twilight zone right now.
[10:05.860 --> 10:11.580]  But what is going to be airing tomorrow on the broadcast and will also then be posted
[10:11.580 --> 10:22.300]  to band.videoandfreeworldnews.tv is General Flynn and the interview I did with him Saturday.
[10:22.300 --> 10:24.180]  It is the essence of victory.
[10:24.180 --> 10:33.180]  If you want a battle plan to defeat the New World Order, this is it.
[10:33.180 --> 10:43.460]  So that's coming up tomorrow, but next segment we'll play a little clip from the Hour Plus
[10:43.460 --> 10:44.460]  long interview.
[10:44.460 --> 10:51.780]  And then there's a second interview with him as well with Patrick Byrne and Joe Flynn.
[10:51.780 --> 10:55.780]  And so look for that on Thursday.
[10:55.780 --> 10:58.940]  Every day we're on air is extremely precious.
[10:58.940 --> 11:01.940]  Every day we're still on air and do not take for granted.
[11:01.940 --> 11:06.460]  The power structure wants us off air, period, and they've given orders to their minions
[11:06.460 --> 11:08.460]  to carry that out.
[11:08.460 --> 11:13.020]  But whatever happens to us, we are not victims.
[11:13.020 --> 11:17.500]  We knowingly knew what we were going into and we stood up to this New World Order.
[11:17.500 --> 11:22.540]  And when everybody else runs for cover, Info Wars is going to be going straight into the
[11:22.540 --> 11:26.860]  fight, wherever the main fight for liberty is happening, wherever the innocent are being
[11:26.860 --> 11:30.580]  persecuted, wherever children are being killed and poisoned.
[11:30.580 --> 11:35.660]  You can bet we're going to be there fighting for them because that's what our soul and
[11:35.660 --> 11:42.340]  spirit commands us to do with extreme pleasure.
[11:42.340 --> 11:46.220]  I mean, I'm high as a kite fighting Satan.
[11:46.220 --> 11:48.700]  I mean, I would not be anywhere else.
[11:48.700 --> 11:53.060]  The more I fight tyranny, the more I face down evil, the more I don't back down.
[11:53.060 --> 11:58.300]  Just the more the universe opens up to just things I could never even imagine.
[11:58.300 --> 12:01.740]  And it's a massive brain boost, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:01.740 --> 12:07.700]  An expansion of the soul like Narls Barkley talks about going crazy, but he's really
[12:07.700 --> 12:08.700]  not going crazy.
[12:08.700 --> 12:10.780]  And just there's so much space.
[12:10.780 --> 12:20.700]  It's just top of your head blows off and it's just so amazing to be in the quiet place
[12:20.700 --> 12:24.780]  in the most high, but it's somewhere I really want to stay.
[12:24.780 --> 12:25.780]  I get frustrated.
[12:25.780 --> 12:26.780]  I get mad.
[12:26.780 --> 12:32.700]  I get angry that the evil is getting away with so much, but at the same time, it's all
[12:32.700 --> 12:33.700]  part of God's plan.
[12:33.700 --> 12:37.380]  You just got to turn it over to God and trust in God and then God is just an incredible
[12:37.380 --> 12:38.380]  impregnable fortress.
[12:38.380 --> 12:41.500]  I'm going to stop talking about that.
[12:41.500 --> 12:45.660]  We're going to come back with the General Flynn clip and then we've got Boris Johnson
[12:45.660 --> 12:48.260]  declaring unlimited shots.
[12:48.260 --> 12:50.500]  There'll just be new shots every few months.
[12:50.500 --> 12:52.540]  You'll just put in your body whatever the government says.
[12:52.540 --> 12:53.740]  You have no personal rights.
[12:53.740 --> 12:55.700]  Fauci's come out and said that as well.
[12:55.700 --> 13:00.260]  I mean, this is just the stuff of science fiction nightmares.
[13:00.260 --> 13:06.260]  And then the death numbers are just exploding in mainline reports from the CDC and FDA.
[13:06.260 --> 13:09.300]  They admit the massive heart attack increases.
[13:09.300 --> 13:12.820]  And so I just am blown away.
[13:12.820 --> 13:18.340]  We're going to try to judiciously get to every bit of this we can today and so much more.
[13:18.340 --> 13:23.020]  We're going to show you images of martial law in Europe that are pretty bone-shilling
[13:23.020 --> 13:24.420]  coming up next segment as well.
[13:24.420 --> 13:28.940]  We got a lot on the economy, a lot on Rittenhouse, a lot on leftist groups actually threatening
[13:28.940 --> 13:32.780]  to attack school boards so they don't keep critical race theory in, but of course the
[13:32.780 --> 13:36.460]  Justice Department doesn't have a word to say about that.
[13:36.460 --> 13:38.660]  That's all coming up in so much more.
[13:38.660 --> 13:44.340]  Separately, I have something extremely exciting to announce.
[13:44.340 --> 13:50.460]  Remember our best-selling tooth whitening toothpaste that people loved so much?
[13:50.460 --> 13:54.660]  Well, it's back reformulated and even better, even more concentrated.
[13:54.660 --> 13:57.140]  So it's like the equivalent of two tubes.
[13:57.140 --> 14:03.300]  Dr. Jones Natural's Super Coral Whitening Toothpaste.
[14:03.300 --> 14:12.420]  It was formerly known as Super Silver, but it's now known as Super Coral Whitening Toothpaste.
[14:12.420 --> 14:16.460]  And because the media was lying and saying that we claimed we had a COVID cure because
[14:16.460 --> 14:19.620]  it had some silver in it, we just removed the silver.
[14:19.620 --> 14:22.580]  Still amazing, extremely high quality.
[14:22.580 --> 14:26.900]  People loved it for whitening properties and so it's the same toothpaste, but it never
[14:26.900 --> 14:31.740]  really had fillers in it, but it had some things in it that weren't as good as what
[14:31.740 --> 14:34.460]  we augmented it with.
[14:34.460 --> 14:42.060]  So Super Coral Whitening Toothpaste now in stock at infowarstore.com and it doesn't have
[14:42.060 --> 14:45.380]  any of the fillers or any of the garbage and it's got all these essential oils and it really
[14:45.380 --> 14:46.820]  is incredible.
[14:46.820 --> 14:47.820]  People loved it.
[14:47.820 --> 14:52.300]  We haven't had it for over a year and now it is back.
[14:52.300 --> 15:00.100]  Super Silver is now Super Coral, chloride free at infowarstore.com or call toll free
[15:00.100 --> 15:03.660]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine and while you're at it, get some

[15:10.420 --> 15:11.980]  It works amazingly well.
[15:11.980 --> 15:18.020]  Both of them are synergistic infowarstore.com and we have the, it's time to get prepared

[16:08.860 --> 16:09.860]  the world.
[16:09.860 --> 16:14.580]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around

[18:00.380 --> 18:08.140]  I'm sitting here it's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting
[18:08.140 --> 18:13.380]  on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna
[18:13.380 --> 18:18.740]  and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because in studies
[18:18.740 --> 18:23.860]  they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks and
[18:23.860 --> 18:27.780]  then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press it's not getting any
[18:27.780 --> 18:31.940]  circulation it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places
[18:31.940 --> 18:37.660]  like Instagram or Twitter it's just crazy and then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying
[18:37.660 --> 18:41.740]  there's no damage from the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody you're a conspiracy theorist
[18:41.740 --> 18:46.180]  if you say it it's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago
[18:46.180 --> 18:49.900]  came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems they gave the exact
[18:49.900 --> 18:54.980]  reasons why and now it happened that's why info wars is on air because if we weren't
[18:54.980 --> 18:58.420]  on air they can get away with even more of this crap this is just insane these people
[18:58.420 --> 19:04.780]  are killers I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever
[19:04.780 --> 19:11.580]  had in my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has and
[19:11.580 --> 19:21.980]  it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled
[19:21.980 --> 19:29.700]  and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public ENA
[19:29.700 --> 19:37.260]  medically induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled trancey and I know
[19:37.260 --> 19:42.300]  we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad but this
[19:42.300 --> 19:48.620]  is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and
[19:48.620 --> 19:54.100]  collapsing and then coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying
[19:54.100 --> 19:58.700]  to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species
[19:58.700 --> 20:22.420]  as we know it you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:22.420 --> 20:39.060]  but it wasn't because I didn't know enough I knew too much
[20:39.060 --> 20:53.220]  does that make me crazy does that make me crazy does that make me crazy does that make
[20:53.220 --> 21:02.860]  me crazy does that make me crazy yeah possibly possibly all right here we are in the fight
[21:02.860 --> 21:13.100]  in the fray at the tip of the spear going in through and beyond going to be an adventure
[21:13.100 --> 21:18.380]  just make sure you're not on the wrong side of history that's part of the song right here
[21:18.380 --> 21:35.580]  who do you think you are you think you're in control go ahead and try to play God global
[21:35.580 --> 21:55.180]  see how far that gets you but I was young always wanted to be those people out there
[21:55.180 --> 22:12.340]  on the edge fighting tyranny and I'll remember don't be like them and now we've got all these
[22:12.340 --> 22:22.820]  prominent people all these prominent people are coming out realizing there's nothing
[22:22.820 --> 22:28.140]  left to lose but fight tyranny we are being destroyed because we're not standing against
[22:28.140 --> 22:37.660]  evil all right let's go ahead my friends and go to this very important little short clip
[22:37.660 --> 22:44.180]  that's from just the intro of the hour long interview with general Flynn that we shot
[22:44.180 --> 22:48.260]  Saturday in San Antonio it's in one of the little green rooms off where he was speaking
[22:48.260 --> 22:53.380]  to crowd of 5,000 people and we're also on Thursday got some other interviews I did in
[22:53.380 --> 22:56.900]  the speech I gave that's gonna be on Thursday and it's very powerful as well the Patrick
[22:56.900 --> 23:04.940]  Berg but this is the interview that really if people listen to it will change the world
[23:04.940 --> 23:09.940]  this is the battle plan of victory here and Flynn just gets stronger and stronger as he
[23:09.940 --> 23:35.860]  goes this is extremely presidential stuff here this is all about sort of a one world
[23:35.860 --> 23:40.420]  order that they're that they're moving toward and this is not a conspiracy theory Alex this
[23:40.420 --> 23:47.460]  is a conspiracy and and what we have to understand is that the big the big take is the United
[23:47.460 --> 23:52.780]  States of America we're in this this battle between really competing ideologies and this
[23:52.780 --> 23:57.220]  is no kidding that in the competing ideologies is whether we're gonna continue on as a as
[23:57.220 --> 24:03.660]  a democracy and a and a constitutional republic or whether we're gonna go become a a communist
[24:03.660 --> 24:08.580]  country my father was a World War two vet and my mom right thank God that she decided
[24:08.580 --> 24:14.380]  to have as many kids as she did they handed my brothers and sisters on a silver platter
[24:14.380 --> 24:20.460]  a beautiful country okay I am not about to take that platter that I was given and turn
[24:20.460 --> 24:25.740]  it over to my children and my grandchildren as a communist country politically people
[24:25.740 --> 24:31.220]  have to get active when someone somebody says to me or somebody says to you in around the
[24:31.220 --> 24:37.500]  Thanksgiving table here coming up if you could afford the turkeys that are that might that
[24:37.500 --> 24:43.340]  might be on the shelves and they say well I don't do that political thing outside politics
[24:43.340 --> 24:48.980]  is for whatever then you know what you better not complain because our entire lives right
[24:48.980 --> 24:54.620]  now everybody every American their lives are wrapped around politics right now if you don't
[24:54.620 --> 24:58.100]  think that something's changing you don't feel the way I feel right now you don't feel the
[24:58.100 --> 25:03.780]  way these 5000 people out here feel then something's wrong what we're really facing is an attack
[25:03.780 --> 25:10.620]  or an assault on all of our basic rights I mean I think the the real issue here in play
[25:10.620 --> 25:16.740]  is the attack on freedom of speech you have this incredibly failed foreign policy by the
[25:16.740 --> 25:22.020]  Biden administration you have you know more and more very clear evidence coming out about
[25:22.020 --> 25:26.780]  COVID and the and really the conspiracy behind COVID and some of the things that are happening
[25:26.780 --> 25:32.700]  with it I applaud you for it was one of your interviews 10 years ago probably 10 years ago
[25:32.700 --> 25:36.860]  may have been more than 10 years ago now where you actually were talking about these issues
[25:36.860 --> 25:42.820]  and you you covered it for quite a while actually at that time and I think that you got a lot
[25:42.820 --> 25:48.020]  of bashing by you know the by others in the media and by others around the world because
[25:48.020 --> 25:54.980]  it was like oh this guy Alex and lo and behold here we are a decade later and they have implemented
[25:54.980 --> 25:59.820]  this strategy this great reset strategy the globalists have said in their white papers
[25:59.820 --> 26:05.420]  in their own UN documents that they want to create race specific bio weapons and other
[26:05.420 --> 26:09.900]  systems to depopulate the planet a lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing
[26:09.900 --> 26:15.740]  to release bio weapons claim that they're naturally occurring and then use that as the
[26:15.740 --> 26:22.380]  cover for civil emergency societal control crackdowns on free speech Obama put the internet
[26:22.380 --> 26:26.620]  kill switch in five years ago and when he got confronted by it by Congress he said well
[26:26.620 --> 26:33.660]  it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out just type that in CDC says internet kill switch
[26:33.660 --> 26:38.420]  is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out and they have to control panic and direct every
[26:38.420 --> 26:43.620]  website in the US to one government announcement and we looked at every angle and believe a
[26:43.620 --> 26:48.340]  bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to
[26:48.340 --> 26:53.380]  counter a global problem and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that
[26:53.380 --> 27:05.140]  may save their world government.
[27:05.140 --> 27:08.460]  We are back ladies and gentlemen and we're going to break in two minutes we got some
[27:08.460 --> 27:14.020]  long segments coming up and I'm going to lay out the next phase of their takeover which
[27:14.020 --> 27:18.580]  is now here locked down to and they're not going to call the lock down but that's what
[27:18.580 --> 27:23.540]  it is where if you don't have your injections whatever the new injection handed down by
[27:23.540 --> 27:28.700]  Pfizer is to the UN you will be locked up in your house to go bankrupt and then you'll
[27:28.700 --> 27:30.900]  be taken to a camp.
[27:30.900 --> 27:36.780]  We have footage of this actually happening in Austria in Australia I know the two sound
[27:36.780 --> 27:40.820]  the same but it's actually happening in both countries and taking people away to camps
[27:40.820 --> 27:46.420]  we have the footage of all this and more coming up next segment and Boris Johnson announcing
[27:46.420 --> 27:51.620]  the UK is now going to implement it as well and I have the London Guardian bragging about
[27:51.620 --> 27:56.860]  how wonderful it's all going to be so living in denial is only going to let this take
[27:56.860 --> 28:00.940]  place and so many people go well Jones I'll just take a third fourth fifth sixth shot
[28:00.940 --> 28:05.780]  they're talking about seven to ten a year and of course you submit that will be one
[28:05.780 --> 28:09.580]  a day or one hour I mean they're going to do this till you just get used to getting
[28:09.580 --> 28:14.740]  injections that make you sterile and die but the evidence is one shot super bad two is
[28:14.740 --> 28:20.060]  incredibly horrible three is just a stratospheric problems and they're just normalizing it
[28:20.060 --> 28:24.700]  incremental it's like putting a frog in the pot turn the heat up slowly that's exactly
[28:24.700 --> 28:28.620]  what they're doing and they think we don't have a memory they think we don't have common
[28:28.620 --> 28:36.060]  sense it's really a big test this is a Darwinistic IQ test if you don't I mean hell this woman
[28:36.060 --> 28:39.740]  was bragging to my wife yesterday how she's gonna take her seven and ten year old to get
[28:39.740 --> 28:42.340]  vaccinated yesterday she was playing tennis with her and she didn't even warn the lady
[28:42.340 --> 28:46.340]  she said well it's just Darwinistic she wants to kill her kids and I said honey that's terrible
[28:46.340 --> 28:49.860]  she said look she knows who I am she knows who you are she shot her mouth out before
[28:49.860 --> 28:54.100]  she was just rubbing it in so she wants to brain damage her kids it's up to her I don't
[28:54.100 --> 28:57.380]  think she has a right to hurt her children but that's where we are we'll be right back

[31:59.800 --> 32:08.760]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[32:08.760 --> 32:14.440]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[32:15.080 --> 32:21.560]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge. It is the symbol
[32:21.560 --> 32:27.800]  that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light
[32:27.800 --> 32:37.160]  of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil. Ladies and
[32:37.160 --> 32:44.520]  gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[32:44.520 --> 32:48.360]  Cloud Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the
[32:48.360 --> 32:54.840]  World ID and carbon taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better if we
[32:54.840 --> 32:58.840]  resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[32:58.840 --> 33:04.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:04.840 --> 33:06.840]  You
[33:06.840 --> 33:16.840]  You
[33:28.040 --> 33:31.480]  The threat is real and the enemy is here.
[33:31.480 --> 33:33.480]  I
[33:36.360 --> 33:44.200]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[33:47.080 --> 33:53.240]  And we are back. We have returned on this live November 16th Tuesday transmission. I am your
[33:53.240 --> 34:01.720]  host, Alex Jones, in the thick of the fight to stand against the globalist and to energize the
[34:01.720 --> 34:09.880]  people to stand up and not be enslaved. And our mission is going well. You know, a lot of people
[34:09.880 --> 34:14.520]  look at the republic and they see all the problems in the left trying to destroy it and bankrupt it.
[34:14.520 --> 34:20.120]  And then we think, hey, our country isn't so free. But then when you start to look around the world
[34:20.120 --> 34:25.800]  and you see how much more horrible those places are, I mean, they're most Africa is still locked
[34:25.800 --> 34:29.480]  down. Most of Latin America is still locked down. Most of the Caribbean is still partially locked
[34:29.480 --> 34:33.880]  down. Most of Asia is still locked down. Those governments are authoritarian run. They use this
[34:33.880 --> 34:41.960]  excuse. They jumped on board with the UN. They're doing it. And now you see out of all the world
[34:41.960 --> 34:50.200]  what Brazil is quasi free and the globalists are moving against them. And America is quasi free
[34:50.200 --> 34:58.040]  and they're moving against us. And you see that the republican party isn't totally on board with
[34:58.040 --> 35:03.400]  the new world order completely. And so we don't just throw all our support behind the republican
[35:03.400 --> 35:09.240]  party. No, we expose the democratic party as an outside globalist group destroying the nation.
[35:09.240 --> 35:15.800]  And the republican party made up of neocons is also allied with that with the populace that
[35:15.800 --> 35:21.640]  are in the republican party that Trump wrote into power on. Trump does not control those people.
[35:21.640 --> 35:27.720]  Trump is not the boss of those people. Trump rode to power on that populace movement that myself
[35:27.720 --> 35:36.440]  and many of you and Ron Paul and Rand Paul have the way for. Now Trump is able to energize the
[35:36.440 --> 35:41.640]  grassroots republicans and almost everybody out of 150 something races he's endorsed. He's only
[35:41.640 --> 35:50.120]  lost two. So I like Trump. I know Trump means well. I know Trump is at many levels fighting hard.
[35:50.680 --> 35:53.720]  And the globalists hated his guts because he actually tried to be the president.
[35:53.720 --> 36:01.480]  But it is also a issue with the fact that he's pigheaded. And then once he signed on to this
[36:01.480 --> 36:07.400]  poison vaccine, he will not admit he's wrong. And we've had Robert F. Kennedy talk about it.
[36:07.960 --> 36:11.480]  Some of the senators have talked about the trap that's been laid. I want to play those clips
[36:11.480 --> 36:18.760]  here in a moment. Where once you've committed as a doctor or a lawyer or a teacher or a business
[36:18.760 --> 36:27.160]  owner to forcing this garbage on people or even a parent, a sign of weakness and a sign of a slave
[36:27.160 --> 36:33.720]  class is that they don't admit to their mistakes. Like the left runs all these headlines all over
[36:33.720 --> 36:39.480]  the news every time I tell the story. I've been telling on air for 28 years.
[36:41.800 --> 36:46.600]  Some of my first access TV shows 28 years ago, I explained to people that I was a Christian,
[36:46.600 --> 36:52.360]  but that I wasn't a Bible thumper. And I wasn't judging people. And I explained how the left
[36:52.360 --> 36:58.840]  would control women and men that had taken part in abortions by saying, you're a sinner. You're
[36:58.840 --> 37:04.120]  going to hell. You killed a baby. And so they go, no, it's not a baby screw you. And then they
[37:04.120 --> 37:09.560]  commit and harden their hearts instead of, Hey, God will forgive you. You got set up. You got
[37:09.560 --> 37:13.000]  lied to that was a human life. You know, your heart deep down, you know, it's true.
[37:13.000 --> 37:16.840]  Just ask God for forgiveness. The Holy Spirit will come into you and you'll be freed of this
[37:16.840 --> 37:21.480]  weight of what you were involved in. I know I paid for quite a few abortions and it literally
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.680]  cursed me and I, and I sought God's face and was repenting, not even about the abortions,
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.840]  just the darkness I was in. And God literally, the Holy Spirit said, you need to say you're
[37:30.840 --> 37:35.000]  sorry to those children you killed, and you need to get on your knees and you need to ask
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.640]  forgiveness. And I did. That was taken away from me. And then God said, now here's your mission.
[37:39.640 --> 37:46.280]  I was like 17 years old and it hit me like a, now you, I got rid of that, that curse on you.
[37:46.280 --> 37:52.440]  Now you're going to go to work. And I was like, whoa, whoa, I just got struck by lightning.
[37:52.440 --> 37:57.080]  And that's, that's what happened. They go, oh, he's a hypocrite. He's against abortion.
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.840]  And he admits he's done it. Well, it's like saying you committed a murder, which I did.
[38:04.840 --> 38:10.200]  I'm a murderer. I mean, I didn't just beat my children. I didn't just cut my children up in
[38:10.200 --> 38:16.680]  pieces. I've pounded a few skulls in and, and the, you know, the issue is, is that I've repented of
[38:16.680 --> 38:22.200]  that. And then God said, well, there's going to be a price to pay. So I expect me fed through a meat
[38:22.200 --> 38:27.800]  grinder. Well, that's what my children, my little children, I got them chopped up, vacuum
[38:27.800 --> 38:35.000]  cleaned it up, sold for body parts. I'm a sinner. I repent. I'm a bad person. I'm a killer.
[38:35.000 --> 38:42.120]  But I'll tell you something. God forgave me. And that's, this is all about. So, so I digress.
[38:43.640 --> 38:47.880]  Once they get you to go out and push the shots and all this garbage,
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.440]  the people are going to go into Stockholm syndrome when they figure out what they did.
[38:52.440 --> 38:56.600]  I mean, I see the articles everywhere. This talk show host had a heart attack at 35.
[38:56.600 --> 39:01.720]  This soccer player had a heart attack at 37. This football player had a heart attack at 24.
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.280]  But they still are proud. They took the shot and they plan on taking more shots.
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.080]  Stacks of prominent dead people every day. I can't even read all their names out on air.
[39:17.080 --> 39:23.480]  A 66 times increase in microcarditis and heart attacks in young people. And I have in the stack
[39:23.480 --> 39:29.720]  today FDA.gov admissions by their panels saying they've got to put stronger warnings out. So
[39:29.720 --> 39:33.960]  wait, you tell us there's a strong warning for heart attack and then make us take it. It's like,
[39:33.960 --> 39:37.640]  you see on the package, this can make you have a heart attack or heart swelling or mess up your
[39:37.640 --> 39:41.160]  heart valves. It can be really dangerous. It's up to you whether you want to take it or not.
[39:41.160 --> 39:43.400]  But if you don't, we're going to make you homeless.
[39:48.920 --> 39:55.880]  Wow. So I know how sin works. And I know how once you've committed it, the devil puts pressure on
[39:55.880 --> 40:00.600]  you and uses the fact you have a conscience against you to manipulate and control you.
[40:00.600 --> 40:04.600]  Instead of just going to God and God will wipe it out. Ladies and gentlemen,
[40:04.600 --> 40:07.400]  doesn't mean you're perfect, but those weights are gone.
[40:08.680 --> 40:12.920]  You use the analogy of the Christmas story where
[40:15.720 --> 40:20.040]  his old boss has got all these giant chains and balls on him. All the bad things he did.
[40:20.040 --> 40:25.480]  He's got to carry on his back for eternity. You can feel that weight when you've committed
[40:25.480 --> 40:30.840]  really big crimes and sins. You need to get rid of it. It's a long way back from hell.
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.200]  You don't want to cross that line. Quote Glenn Danzig.
[40:37.880 --> 40:47.640]  It's a long way back from hell. You don't want to cross that line. Cross that line.
[40:47.640 --> 40:57.480]  And so it is a long way back from hell. And I've been there and I'm back
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.960]  thanks to God, thanks to Jesus Christ. And they hate that because they know it's real.
[41:03.960 --> 41:05.880]  They know this is all real. Ladies and gentlemen,
[41:06.920 --> 41:12.600]  and they know that they want to take you with them for eternity and absolutely dominate you.
[41:12.600 --> 41:18.600]  They want you to shine on to your 15 minutes of fame with Satan and you think you're invincible
[41:18.600 --> 41:24.520]  and you think you're insulated and you think you're protected. Just like these black robe
[41:24.520 --> 41:30.760]  tyrants who think because the corporate media worships them and helps them to be deceptive
[41:30.760 --> 41:37.160]  that they're on the winning team. They're on the losing team. So when I come back,
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.880]  I'll get to the incredible martial law in Australia and Spain and Austria and
[41:41.880 --> 41:47.080]  Austria and now being announced in the UK. And then I'm going to play Senator Johnson explaining
[41:47.080 --> 41:54.920]  what I just explained, but a little bit quicker and better, I guess. And also the prime minister,
[41:54.920 --> 41:59.720]  the fake patriot, the Trojan horse. It was always a leftist. We knew that. He came in
[41:59.720 --> 42:05.400]  to destroy Brexit and bring the UK to its knees. Boris Johnson making those announcements. That's
[42:05.400 --> 42:10.680]  on the other side. We have a huge sale going right now and Info Wars wants to massively expand in
[42:10.680 --> 42:14.920]  the face of all the attacks. So your financial support is not just key. It's critical. Plus

[43:04.680 --> 43:09.640]  how's it going, Alex? Good. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep
[43:09.640 --> 43:14.280]  supplement. It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting,
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.600]  moralization and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone. And all right,
[43:18.600 --> 43:23.000]  Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead. Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.400]  could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the one of the product. The X2 does wonders.
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.400]  I recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence, get the product,
[43:31.400 --> 43:36.120]  support the Info War. Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead. Hey, Alex,
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.840]  it's great to be on with you. It's an honor. Honored to talk to you. Awesome. So first thing I
[43:40.840 --> 43:47.000]  wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half,
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.040]  she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So just number one for a few years. It definitely works.
[43:52.040 --> 43:54.280]  It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[43:58.920 --> 44:05.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist. I wanted to stop
[44:05.000 --> 44:10.360]  their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went
[44:10.360 --> 44:15.960]  operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake. Yes, we're not getting caught flatfooted,
[44:15.960 --> 44:22.360]  but they are going ahead with their full operational, deindustrialization, great reset. And that's
[44:22.360 --> 44:27.240]  why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.040]  the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information
[44:32.040 --> 44:36.360]  warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared.
[44:36.360 --> 44:39.960]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food,
[44:39.960 --> 44:45.880]  ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or a year
[44:45.880 --> 44:52.120]  supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[44:52.120 --> 44:57.080]  and before there are long lines and waits because believe me, serious times are coming. Get ready
[44:57.080 --> 45:04.200]  at infowarstore.com. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've
[45:04.200 --> 45:11.320]  ever had in my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss that everybody else has. And it's
[45:11.320 --> 45:22.440]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[45:23.720 --> 45:30.520]  And now we're just throwing it all away. And I see the general public, ENA, medically induced,
[45:30.520 --> 45:37.880]  scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled tranche. And I know we're being fed
[45:37.880 --> 45:44.520]  into this globalist being grounded. It's so incredibly sad. But this is the process of birth
[45:44.520 --> 45:49.880]  and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back
[45:49.880 --> 45:55.560]  to life again. It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[45:55.560 --> 46:00.760]  decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it. Infowar's life is bringing you a
[46:00.760 --> 46:06.760]  breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new,
[46:06.760 --> 46:12.280]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and
[46:12.280 --> 46:19.640]  sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[46:19.640 --> 46:25.080]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[46:25.080 --> 46:30.760]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials. And decades later, we now have
[46:30.760 --> 46:35.960]  the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[46:35.960 --> 46:42.200]  distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[46:42.200 --> 46:46.760]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[46:46.760 --> 46:52.200]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside
[46:52.200 --> 46:58.600]  and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable
[46:58.600 --> 47:04.120]  tablets. We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:04.120 --> 47:27.800]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm a friend of thunder. Friend, is it any wonder a lightning
[47:27.800 --> 47:44.280]  comes by me? I've parked with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[47:44.280 --> 47:55.160]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I can spot mad weather, and I'm good at finding shelter in a
[47:55.160 --> 48:07.640]  dead cold. I've been sacrificed by brothers, crucified by lovers, but through it all I've
[48:07.640 --> 48:13.560]  been asked to repay. We are back, ladies and gentlemen, on this incredible November 16th,
[48:13.560 --> 48:21.800]  Tuesday transmission. All right, here we are, ladies and gentlemen. Talk about tyranny. You knew
[48:21.800 --> 48:28.920]  it was coming, but this is a worldwide planetary program of lies, of deceit. Oh, just 15 days of
[48:28.920 --> 48:33.080]  flatten the curve. Oh, a few months wearing a mask, a few more months keeping things locked down,
[48:33.080 --> 48:40.200]  and then you notice the lockdown never ends, except 40-something states that the Democrats don't
[48:40.200 --> 48:46.840]  fully control. It's only 10 states that are still under the tyranny, but hundreds of cities, almost
[48:46.840 --> 48:52.520]  every city is under their control, and that's the UN plan. Number 10, that's the Prime Minister's office
[48:53.480 --> 49:01.080]  in the UK plans booster jab requirement for people to obtain their COVID pass. It's breaking
[49:01.080 --> 49:08.440]  today in the London Guardian. And the way the PsiOperers work is, as soon as he came out and
[49:08.440 --> 49:15.560]  gave a speech yesterday and said that, when people said they were against it on Twitter, I noticed,
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.040]  I said, let me click the comments to see what it says. The bots and the operatives were saying,
[49:20.040 --> 49:26.200]  he's not making you. This isn't tyranny. And then the next day they announced it. So they gaslight
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.960]  you even while they do it. Oh, no, nobody's taking your rights. Nobody's going to make you have a
[49:29.960 --> 49:34.280]  passport to buy and sell, and then boom, they do it. Just like, oh, we're going to have a passport
[49:34.280 --> 49:37.240]  to buy and sell. Oh, we're not going to have a passport to buy and sell. Oh, the passport goes
[49:37.240 --> 49:40.840]  in effect November 1st. Oh, now we're not going to do it. November 1st. Oh, now it's going to actually
[49:40.840 --> 49:45.800]  come in at the new year. Oh, you know, oh, we're not going to have a vaccine passport to have any
[49:45.800 --> 49:50.440]  shots. We're just going to make you take the boosters as well. Remember? Remember just six
[49:50.440 --> 49:55.800]  months ago. Okay, there's major opposition. We're thinking about not doing the COVID passport.
[49:56.440 --> 49:59.400]  And then, okay, we're going to do it. Okay, we're not going to do it. Okay, we're going to do it.
[49:59.400 --> 50:02.440]  Okay, we're not going to do it. That's just to wear you out in the decision process.
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.720]  Psychological tactic until you finally just accept it because you expect it to happen.
[50:07.720 --> 50:14.120]  They're trying to wear you out. Just like they're like, hey, you didn't hurt your child with a shot
[50:14.120 --> 50:18.760]  or you didn't hurt yourself. Just be in denial. Hey, you didn't abort your child. That's not murder.
[50:20.040 --> 50:21.320]  Even though deep down you know it is.
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.840]  Welcome to the one year anniversary of our two week lockdown. Yeah, that means almost a year old.
[50:28.840 --> 50:34.040]  And soon it'll be the second anniversary of the lockdown, which in Australia, they're now announcing
[50:34.040 --> 50:39.480]  permanent the same thing in Europe. Beating people with billy clubs over their heads in Spain,
[50:39.480 --> 50:47.800]  Germany, and Austria, if they're outside or in a grocery store and don't have their phone,
[50:47.800 --> 50:53.400]  just go, oh, I've got my Vax pass. Oh, yes, sir. Oh, good. I mean, and then they just gaslight
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.800]  everybody. Oh, it's normal to do this completely for your safety when they're the ones that cooked
[50:57.800 --> 51:04.840]  it up in a lab, made the virus and then created a vaccine that creates what the virus does. And
[51:04.840 --> 51:08.920]  then who would expect something that evil? You see, the average person goes, well, they must mean
[51:08.920 --> 51:14.680]  well. I mean, they're not. Well, I've been having a heart attack, but it's not that bad. So here is
[51:14.680 --> 51:21.320]  Boris Johnson with his just unbelievable announcement. Boosters. It's very clear that getting
[51:21.320 --> 51:28.680]  three jabs, getting your booster will become an important fact. And it will make life easier for
[51:28.680 --> 51:34.680]  you in all sorts of ways. And we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full
[51:34.680 --> 51:41.160]  vaccination to take account of that. And I think that is increasingly obvious. Boosters. You'll
[51:41.160 --> 51:46.920]  have to have them. And of course, my wife is a devil worship on record, but in a sex mystery,
[51:46.920 --> 51:53.480]  so I'm not compromised at all. Boosters. Of course, he's not going to be taking any
[51:53.480 --> 52:01.480]  boosters himself. You're going to be taking boosters. Now, let's go to the latest clip of the
[52:01.480 --> 52:08.840]  man on fire, Robert F. Kennedy, explaining junior, explaining, because, you know, he used to be kind
[52:08.840 --> 52:13.240]  of anti-gun, but I've seen his speeches around his articles. Now he's like Naomi Wolf said on Fox
[52:13.240 --> 52:17.560]  News six months ago or five months ago with Tucker Carlson. He said, I used to not get the second
[52:17.560 --> 52:21.400]  amendment. Like, why do you really need that? But now I get it. The government's evil and tyrannical.
[52:21.400 --> 52:26.600]  I need to protect myself. See, real liberals now go, wait, you want to take over the police and
[52:26.600 --> 52:32.120]  make them political commissars? Wait, you actually want crime in the streets. You actually want me
[52:32.120 --> 52:35.880]  not to be able to defend myself. That's really evil. You want to be the only ones with the guns?
[52:36.600 --> 52:41.080]  Oh, oh, now I get it. Now I understand they're breaking the social contract.
[52:41.080 --> 52:48.040]  And so I need guns more than ever. Here's Robert F. Kennedy Jr. finally getting it. And that's
[52:48.040 --> 52:53.000]  exactly what I was telling my head of security yesterday is they couldn't get the guns, so they
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.520]  got everything else. There was no lobby for the First Amendment, no lobby for the right to travel,
[52:58.520 --> 53:03.240]  none of that. And it's all going out the window, folks. I mean, thousands of years people fought
[53:04.040 --> 53:08.840]  to get the freedoms we have enshrined and defended. And it's just being flushed down the toilet,
[53:08.840 --> 53:14.120]  like some big, beautiful palace that was built. And then the gremlins just doused it in gasoline
[53:14.120 --> 53:19.720]  and lit it on fire. Here he is. That's why we had the revolution so that we could criticize the
[53:19.720 --> 53:27.000]  government. And yet, and we put that first. And yet it's gone. We then they go after
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.800]  property rights. They close a million businesses without due process or just compensation. That's
[53:33.800 --> 53:39.720]  the violation of the Constitution. It was just a doctor who has never treated a COVID patient
[53:40.600 --> 53:47.800]  saying one week masks don't work. And a month later, everybody putting them on and not citing
[53:47.800 --> 53:57.000]  one study to justify that change. It was government by dictate. And so during that first year,
[53:57.640 --> 54:03.000]  we literally got rid of every amendment to the Constitution except the Second Amendment. It's
[54:03.000 --> 54:13.720]  the only one that's left. And, you know, what I tell people is, you know, we have to love our
[54:13.720 --> 54:24.040]  freedom more than we fear adjourn. We have to. And, you know, even today, and I would even,
[54:24.040 --> 54:30.120]  you know, remind people that there's, even if this was the deadly disease that they say it is,
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.800]  there's worse things than death. And there was a whole generation and that may sound cold and
[54:35.800 --> 54:42.200]  people get mad at me for saying it. But we're lucky that there was a whole generation of Americans
[54:42.200 --> 54:50.520]  in 1776 who said it would be better to die than to not have these rights written down.
[54:51.800 --> 54:58.120]  And they gave us that. They gave us that gift of that Bill of Rights. And in one year,
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.400]  at the bidding of a doctor, because he's telling us, you know, you need to do this to
[55:03.400 --> 55:10.760]  save them and orchestrated fear and, you know, all of the weird stuff they did with the numbers,
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.800]  which is not what public health is supposed to be doing in one year. All of those rights have
[55:15.800 --> 55:25.880]  been taken away from us on fire. Now let's go to Senator Johnson laying out how they trick you
[55:25.880 --> 55:30.280]  into committing the crime against yourself and your family. And then you won't admit to yourself
[55:30.280 --> 55:35.080]  that you've been conned. It's called Stockholm syndrome. President Biden won't admit he's
[55:35.080 --> 55:39.640]  wrong when he says that this is a pandemic coming in. Vax that if you get the vaccine,
[55:39.640 --> 55:44.040]  all is going to be well. The heads of these agencies will never admit they were going to be,
[55:44.040 --> 55:50.760]  they were wrong. My colleagues who voted for the vaccines who have done videos encouraging
[55:50.760 --> 55:56.440]  everybody to get vaccinated, which by the way, that might be the right advice for certain people.
[55:56.440 --> 56:01.320]  They don't want to admit they're wrong. Doctors, physicians who have recommended to patients
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.920]  to get the vaccine don't want to admit that their recommendation might have caused a severe harm.
[56:09.160 --> 56:14.040]  It's understandable. I understand that human tendency.
[56:14.040 --> 56:24.680]  But that doesn't overcome the basic humanity of acknowledging reality and doing everything we
[56:24.680 --> 56:30.680]  can as a society. Those of us that voted for Operation War Speed, those of us that encouraged
[56:30.680 --> 56:40.120]  vaccination, we have to admit there's a side effect here and has changed people's lives forever.
[56:40.120 --> 56:47.400]  So again, I'm begging anybody watching this today or via video, let these stories be seen.
[56:47.400 --> 56:51.080]  You know what? We're going to break and we're going to come back and play the rest of this.
[56:51.080 --> 56:55.560]  But see, Ron Johnson is a really smart guy. He's also nice. And he's here talking about Trump,
[56:55.560 --> 57:02.520]  really. But again, Trump, I don't think, wanted to kill all these people or be set up like this.
[57:02.520 --> 57:06.040]  But the globalists knew when they put this out and knew was going to kill a bunch of people
[57:06.040 --> 57:09.880]  and made a bunch that then they get everybody in the system on board with the cover up. And once
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.120]  you've done that, it's just like pedophiles in the Catholic Church or in the Boy Scouts or at
[57:14.120 --> 57:19.240]  Penn State. Once you get the system, people that aren't raping kids to still kind of cover it up
[57:19.240 --> 57:22.920]  for the good of the school. Well, it's not the good of the school. Then they fully take over.
[57:23.480 --> 57:28.440]  That's how corruption works. You got to just say, no, I'm not part of it. And I'm not going to go
[57:28.440 --> 57:34.200]  along with it. And I'm going to fight it. That's the path to liberty. That's the path of success.
[57:34.200 --> 57:40.840]  That's the path to God. The path to the devil and failure and everything horrible is compromising.
[57:40.840 --> 57:45.320]  No more compromises. No more. We'll be back with our number two.
[57:47.800 --> 57:52.600]  By now, you've heard me talk about the CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that
[57:53.320 --> 58:00.360]  people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote, dark forces. The FBI and CIA have been
[58:00.360 --> 58:08.040]  advising him on who these evil groups are. They know that all over the world, their poison shot
[58:08.040 --> 58:14.200]  is being banned by major governments. And Moderna's in trouble as well. They know that the people are
[58:14.200 --> 58:19.640]  starting to get wise, this depopulation agenda. In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the
[58:19.640 --> 58:24.600]  shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons, but they're so deadly, they're killing a higher
[58:24.600 --> 58:32.920]  percentage upfront. And so people are waking up. The weapons work a little too good. They're supposed
[58:32.920 --> 58:38.360]  to be silent weapons for quiet wars, but instead they're making too big of a noise. But it's too
[58:38.360 --> 58:43.640]  late for a return back now. They're coming after our children. So it's up to us to protect our
[58:43.640 --> 58:50.440]  little children or God will not look favorably on us. Remember, God is watching. The average person
[58:50.440 --> 58:56.040]  on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals
[58:56.040 --> 59:01.640]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other, who are literally trying to create
[59:01.640 --> 59:06.120]  a post human world for the United States to Brazil. And of course, triggered by the breaks
[59:06.120 --> 59:11.160]  in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[59:11.160 --> 59:17.080]  That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of build back
[59:17.080 --> 59:23.640]  better. This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[59:24.280 --> 59:28.920]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the
[59:28.920 --> 59:34.600]  ideology of this world government system could win. They released a biological weapon on us.
[59:35.240 --> 59:40.520]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't
[59:40.520 --> 59:45.960]  meet us because of our free speech and our guns. So the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[59:45.960 --> 59:49.000]  and you know the rest is history. Expose the spirit on and we win.
[1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:24.120]  All right, I'm going to launch into the worldwide martial law that has been announced.
[1:00:24.840 --> 1:00:29.640]  The global carbon tax announcements and a bunch of key intel on China and the meeting with the
[1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:35.080]  public president yesterday. It coming up next segment, Owen Schreuer is coming up as well.
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:39.000]  I've just got so much. I've got a bunch of written house news. I've got a bunch of
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:43.640]  martial law garbage they're trying to push, but first here's a key report on the race war they're
[1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:51.080]  trying to stoke. If you are receiving this transmission, you are in resistance.
[1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:56.760]  We've learned that critical race theory is now endemic through America's Fortune 100 companies.
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:01:00.920]  I have documents from now more than 33 companies where they're training their employees in
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:05.560]  intersectionality, telling white employees that they're actually internalized white supremacists
[1:01:05.560 --> 1:01:10.280]  and then telling employees of color, racial minorities, that they suffer from internalized
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:15.480]  racial inferiority, that they're filled with self-loathing and rage and hatred, that they're
[1:01:15.480 --> 1:01:21.720]  incapable of seizing opportunity. It's really an all around bad deal for everyone. The only people
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:26.280]  it's good for are the executives. They get to get a pat on the back. They get to be lauded in the
[1:01:26.280 --> 1:01:32.040]  media for being pioneers of social justice. While they're denigrating their hourly wage
[1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:38.920]  employees as white supremacists and hapless human beings, it's a scandal and they have to stop.
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:45.800]  Jeff Zucker wrote this for the CEO, his boss at AT&T that says, quote, white people are the problem,
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:51.960]  reeducate them in reeducation programs, being white genetically is evil. So these are the
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:57.000]  folks telling you that they're protecting you from white supremacists when they're just trying
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:03.080]  to brand any opposition to foreign corporations looting the country, devaluing the dollar,
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:07.720]  locking us in our houses, starving the third world to death. Well, if that's white supremacist,
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:13.160]  I mean, that's what I see as supremist. It's not white supremacist. It's a bunch of
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:19.400]  mega corporations engaging in depopulation. Why did President Biden suggest that Kyle Rittenhouse
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:28.280]  on trial in Kenosha is a white supremacist? So, Peter, what I'm not going to speak to right now
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:34.680]  is anything about an ongoing trial, nor the president's past comments. What I can reiterate
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:41.400]  for you is the president's view that we shouldn't have, broadly speaking, vigilantes patrolling
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:45.560]  our communities with assault weapons. We shouldn't have opportunists corrupting peaceful protests by
[1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:50.520]  rioting and burning down the communities they claim to represent anywhere in the country. As you know,
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:55.160]  closing arguments in this particular case, which I'm not speaking to, I'm just making broad comments
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:03:00.520]  about his own view. There's an ongoing trial. We're awaiting a verdict. Beyond that, I'm not
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:05.160]  going to speak to any individuals or this case. But the president has spoken to it already,
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:10.040]  and his mom now, Kyle Rittenhouse's mom came out saying that the president defamed her son,
[1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:15.480]  and she claims that when the president suggested her son's white supremacist,
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:20.280]  he was doing that to win votes. Is that what happened? I just have nothing more to speak
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:24.760]  to in an ongoing case. Tucker Carlson is releasing his big blockbuster movie on Monday,
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:31.080]  while the kids have been calling for a sequel to Dune. Tucker thought they said loon, as in crazy as
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:36.680]  a loon. As in crazy in a loon. Oh, you're going to call conspiracy theorist and crazy and white
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:04:05.400]  supremacist. No facts, no evidence, no proof, just loon attacks, conspiracy theorist, white supremacist.
[1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:09.320]  But Jim Acosta, again, is the mouth of AT&T, the mouth of one of the most evil
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:13.720]  corporations out there that seeks to divide us while they engage in all their different crimes.
[1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:20.280]  That's the owners of CNN. So here's Jim Acosta, while AT&T is funding Black Lives Matter, racial
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:26.840]  division, whites are inherently bad, CRT, hardcore curriculum, to their own employees.
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:33.240]  Saying Tucker's insane, none of this exists. And there's no establishment move to divide America.
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:39.640]  There's no establishment move to declare the American people as terrorists. That's in the
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:45.880]  official executive order signed in June by the public president. You got to stop being naive,
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:49.960]  ladies and gentlemen. We've all been there. You got to admit how much trouble we're in.
[1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:57.240]  We got to recognize who our enemies are and stop listening to them. Stop even debating.
[1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:06.200]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:11.160]  and chemicals added to the foods. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:16.680]  but because we're made the image of God, the creator. And we are powerful. And the social
[1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:22.280]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody
[1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:31.240]  knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:36.280]  was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their
[1:05:36.280 --> 1:05:43.400]  cultural death because they know we are strong. And they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:47.640]  of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep in full
[1:05:47.640 --> 1:05:52.360]  wars in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists
[1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:57.400]  are manifesting and setting up is shape-channeling. And we are opposing the one world government
[1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:25.560]  and the mark of the beast they just announced. And we are back live now into our number two
[1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:34.440]  on this Tuesday, November 16th transmission that so many powerful corrupt forces are working around
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:39.560]  the clock to silence. But thanks to you and your word of mouth, your prayer, and your visiting
[1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:45.400]  infowarstore.com and supporting us and getting great products. At the same time, info wars is
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:52.040]  quite frankly stronger than we've ever been in many ways. People pay more attention now. They
[1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:57.000]  know we're not making stuff up. They understand we're under attack. And it's just a real blessing
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.960]  and an honor to be here. So I thank the listeners for keeping us on the air. And of course, I
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:08.040]  thank the big guy upstairs for putting us in this position because it's all God. But God is
[1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:14.280]  working through you. And so I salute you and I thank you. Okay, we knew this day was coming.
[1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:20.840]  We knew it was going to happen because we had Operation Lockstep and we had Spars 2023, 2025,
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:25.720]  and we had all our different in game documents. And we knew that they were going to have a viral
[1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:32.200]  scare for Disease X. The UN said this three years ago. Rockefeller Foundation said it 12 years ago
[1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:37.240]  that they would bring out the virus. They would scare everybody. They would try everybody to be
[1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:44.120]  locked down. They'd bring out a vaccine passport that would then be tied to a global travel passport
[1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:48.680]  and an internal passport that would have a carbon tax attached to it.
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:55.400]  That was in the documents 12 years ago. Right around that same time, China started developing
[1:07:55.400 --> 1:08:01.560]  its social credit score and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com that now redirects info wars
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:06.120]  at the time. At the time
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:13.960]  we're the first to report on all of this. And that's not again up here saying, oh, aren't we special?
[1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:20.360]  No, it's saying we've done the research. We've been the tip of the spear. That's why the enemy is so
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:24.760]  upset. That's why they want to solve fear. I mean, if you imagine them panicking three years ago
[1:08:25.400 --> 1:08:29.400]  when I was the finally banned on Twitter six months after I was banned everywhere else,
[1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:33.720]  and there were videos of millions of you saying, I believe they're about to release a deadly virus
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:39.080]  to create fear and then have lockdowns and bring in a global ID out of the system. Here's the documents.
[1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:44.760]  Which what do you think they thought when they saw that they said, get him off now,
[1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:49.320]  shut him up. How the hell does he know all this? Well, you guys brag about it.
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:57.000]  Now we've moved into a whole new area in the last 20 something months of this roll out of fear.
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:05.800]  And now what they're doing is they are saying that
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:16.200]  we need lockdowns permanently all the time. And we're going to give you a great opportunity
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:21.000]  to be allowed out of your house sometimes. Now you heard what I just did right there. I mean,
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.920]  if you walked into used car lot where you thought they might be scammers, you don't know this is
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:29.480]  good guys. You just want to get a good deal. You just want to be able to check the cars.
[1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:36.120]  You don't want to be lied to. And a guy comes over with a, you know, child molester mustache
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:40.600]  or whatever wearing a tropical shirt and starts obviously giving you a bunch of flim flam,
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:46.040]  you're going to walk off a lot. And you'd expect him if he was a politician or somebody like Fauci
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:50.760]  to say something like this, hey, we're going to save the earth. It's really wonderful. We're
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:55.240]  going to give you an opportunity to sometimes be able to leave your house and maybe even travel
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:10:01.000]  sometimes. If you're really good and behave yourself the right way and go along with our agenda,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:08.680]  you'll have a little bit of freedom. I mean, that on its face is gaslighting to the next level because
[1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:13.480]  it's actually Stockholm syndromeing people where an authority figure is telling you obviously
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:17.960]  something horrible, but you've been trained to just be delusional and accept it because you
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:23.400]  don't want to admit something bad is happening to you. It's why statistically women are 10,
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:28.760]  20, 30 times, depending on the study, more likely to get in a van with a man that pulls up and pulls
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:33.080]  out a knife or a gun and says get in. Most men will just run or fight because they know it's
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:37.240]  scarier to get in that van. It's not because the men have a bunch of courage. It's because they're
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:44.040]  not naive genetically. Men are more programmed to fight and to actually look through the options.
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:49.720]  Women are programmed by their genetics on average to try to get along with everybody and try to,
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:54.600]  you know, make people ease back a little bit. So, okay, sir, don't hurt me. Everything's okay.
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:58.520]  And then she ends up, you know, in a basement torture for two weeks before she's killed.
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:04.040]  And that's what Stockholm syndrome is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:09.320]  They get you to induct yourself into it. And again, women and children are way more likely
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:13.000]  to go into Stockholm syndrome. And maybe that's a survival attribute. Maybe, maybe,
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.920]  maybe it's best sometimes. I mean, that's why the Romans and every other ancient empire where
[1:11:16.920 --> 1:11:21.640]  they would take over an area would kill men above the age of 10 or 11. And they would keep the women
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:28.360]  and girls because the women and girls would self-enforce on each other and just instantly convert
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:36.120]  within a few days to make their children survive. I mean, even if a woman just saw her husband
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:41.480]  at 20 years cut up and tortured to death, she's going to give those Roman centurions the best
[1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:46.520]  blowjob of their life that evening so that they don't kill her children. I'm sorry to have to
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:51.640]  talk like that. But this is where real men need to come in and stop and go, hey, women, you're
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:56.200]  under Stockholm syndrome. Stop wearing the mask. Stop going along with your captors. This is BS.
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:02.680]  You see, there's men that are sheepdogs that want to protect people and build civilization.
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:07.240]  And there's oppressors and bad men that want to dominate and enslave you. Now, the Romans didn't
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:12.120]  do that to their own people on average. They just did it to groups they saw as beneath them,
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:16.360]  that they could conquer. That was the survival of the fittest rule. That's what they saw in nature.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.880]  The globalists go way further than Romans or the Aztecs or anybody else that did similar things.
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:26.920]  They don't even want any strong people, period, because they don't even want any
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:31.400]  fellow humans out there. They want to make the whole species like dumb animals,
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:35.480]  so they can have their way with us and toy around with us and use us for body parts.
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:44.680]  So that's where the whole world is. That's where all of this is right now. And you can be a chump,
[1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:50.120]  and you can be a schmuck, and you can be a mark, and you can be a sucker, and you can be a fool,
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:54.440]  and you can be delusional, and you can lie to yourself all day long as long as you want.
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:13:00.600]  But bowing down to this is how you get hurt real bad and end up with nothing and dead.
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:06.600]  This is real evil, the worst the world's ever seen, and people better snap out of their trance
[1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:11.720]  and get that, or it's over. So what am I getting at here? Here's here's had lines, we've got video
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:19.720]  of this. Austrian police randomly check the vaccination status of shoppers after lockdown
[1:13:20.280 --> 1:13:25.480]  of unvaccinated, not allowed outside your house if you haven't had the shots. We always do. That's
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:30.760]  where it was going. It's now happening in Australia, it's now happening in Spain, and now the UK just
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:35.160]  announced the same thing. Or a shot is like, you're not going to be too comfortable if you don't
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:40.760]  just keep taking the boosters. A couple months ago, we're not going to have vaccine passports.
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:45.480]  Now, oh, actually, I've got to take more shots. You're going to have it, and then some. Now, we knew
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:52.440]  where this was going, didn't we? Are you ready for the climate lockdowns?
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:59.240]  Remember that back in February? All over the leftist media, London Guardian, you name it,
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:06.040]  oh, climate lockdowns would be so good for the earth. Should the climate movement embrace sabotage,
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:13.160]  another headline, the New Yorker, yeah, blow stuff up, yeah, shut off pipelines. And now here it is.
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:20.680]  India is announcing climate lockdowns. What government doesn't want the power to tell you when
[1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:24.840]  you can be on the street and when you can't? Oh, the Indians didn't want to accept a national ID card?
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:30.680]  Well, guess what? As soon as they did, now you're under martial law. Because governments want that
[1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:35.000]  power to snap their fingers and walk out and have their motor cage drive wherever they want, or do
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.960]  whatever they want. They want that power, lockdown to combat air pollution, and they want that
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:46.040]  they want that power, lockdown to combat air pollution. New Delhi prepares to ban non-essential
[1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:53.000]  travel in close offices due to toxic smog, even though India torpedoed Coke 26 cold deal. But
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:59.560]  don't worry, India and China aren't going to follow it. Mexico isn't, but we are. Black Rock CEO Larry
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:04.280]  Fink Climate Crisis will reshape finance. They'll only give money to themselves. The world needs
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:10.680]  equivalent of pandemic lockdown. Forbes, technocrats want mandatory carbon credit cards to control
[1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:16.760]  every fast of your life. In full wars back in September, now officially announced. And it goes
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:23.080]  on and on. Oh, cut down trees, says CNN. Oh, but meanwhile, this is in Reuters today. China rebuffs
[1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:32.120]  UK criticism over coal move after climate summit. China rebuffs UK criticism over coal move after
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:37.960]  climate summit. Oh, yeah, they're not going to do cut anything. Only we are. And then Gigi
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:44.200]  Ping gave old, old crazy man old skeletor of spanking yesterday in their virtual summit. We'll
[1:15:44.200 --> 1:15:49.160]  tell you about that when we come back to the whole written house situation and so much more.
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:56.280]  This is the tip of the spear. This is the battle for human destiny. This is info wars. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:03.640]  What if you could cut your heating? There is very little contemporary study in the world
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:10.760]  of the planet's ruling class, not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States,
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:16.840]  not anywhere. Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design.
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:22.920]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:27.880]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:31.720]  group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:37.080]  and the Rockefellers. Until 10 years ago, the media said the control corporate media of the
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:41.880]  Bilderberg group didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head,
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:47.160]  still on the steering committee, is called Schwab. And he has set up the great reset in
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:52.120]  global government. And if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:56.760]  on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:01.560]  a shot. We do expose them, we should beat them easily. UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:06.760]  They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:10.840]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:17:10.840 --> 1:17:17.160]  and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:17:17.160 --> 1:17:21.960]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:26.680]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:31.720]  martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:36.280]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military

[1:19:56.360 --> 1:20:04.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:30.040]  You got it.
[1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:45.480]  Global government by private corporations working with client
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:53.800]  politicians in different nation states are establishing a planetary one world government
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:59.400]  based on the leading cutting edge or the tip of the spear going into our body politic,
[1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:05.960]  being the COVID-19 hysteria. The basis of it is then the COVID-19 vaccine passport.
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:09.960]  And upon that, the global carbon tax, the travel pass, the social credit score,
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:15.640]  all rolled into one. That's official from them. I mean, Klaus Schwab six years ago was on national
[1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:20.360]  French TV and said all that in an hour long interview. We played large excerpts. We're going
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:25.160]  to bring in the world ID using a scarab virus. You're going to have a microchip in you after
[1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:29.320]  you have a smartphone pass for a few years. We're going to control everything you do. We're going
[1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:33.880]  to take your body over with nanobots and then other members of the Davos group top ones. We
[1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:40.840]  played clips on national Israeli TV on national German TV. Just saying we are taking you over.
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:44.920]  We're going to put nanobots in all the food. They're going to migrate to your brain and you're
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:50.600]  just going to be forced to merge with us. And then the USDA announced last week,
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:55.240]  two weeks after the Davos group announced, governments will now put nanobots in your food
[1:21:55.240 --> 1:22:01.160]  for your safety. And then the USDA said, we're going to put nanobots in your food. And you're
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:05.720]  like, I mean, first it's we're going to give you an experimental shot that gives you blood clots.
[1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:10.040]  Then they're going to, oh, we're going to have blood, a heart attack drug to get for children.
[1:22:10.040 --> 1:22:18.040]  Oh, now we're just going to put nanobots in your food. So that's the thing. This is a lawless,
[1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:25.880]  giant attack. And while Senator Paul and Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and a few of the half decent
[1:22:25.880 --> 1:22:34.920]  people we got are still discussing the Wuhan lab and how Fauci lied and all this stuff and discussing
[1:22:34.920 --> 1:22:39.240]  how Russiagate, how they're not Russian agents, which we already know, while they're talking
[1:22:39.240 --> 1:22:45.800]  about last year's news, five years ago's news, the New World Order is just racing over all of us
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:51.960]  in a Blitzkrieg attack. And it's my job before they cut off all the communications after a
[1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:58.440]  stage cyber attack, or a real war they're about to start to get as many people as informed so
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:01.800]  they know what's going on. It's kind of like you're out in the ocean, you get in a riptide,
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:07.560]  you feel it sucking you under, get a breath, and then don't fight it once it pulls you under.
[1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:11.080]  Statistically, it's going to pop you back out in 30 seconds, some minute or two.
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:14.600]  Just hold your breath, relax, don't fight. You're going to pop right back out. But
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:18.440]  I'm not saying don't fight them physically, they do this, it's an analogy. So you're just like,
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:24.520]  oh, gosh, I'm going to fight this. Okay. Oh, that popped me out in five seconds. That wasn't too bad.
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:31.560]  That's people that flail around in it that panic and get the water down their throat. Now,
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:41.160]  I'm just here, tell everybody, get your deep breath. Get your deep breath. Get your deep breath. I mean,
[1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:45.560]  they may launch a nuclear attack and say the Russians did it. I mean, they want us dead,
[1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:48.920]  they want us out of the way, they've made the decision. And the fact that they've rolled ahead
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:53.640]  with this bio attack means they could do anything. And that's really why the senators aren't fighting
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:58.360]  them. The senators have got their emergency exit plans during martial law, they've got their underground
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:02.360]  base cards. And of course, once they get them in those bases, they're going to kill them all,
[1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:09.240]  the whole COG system. So this is just the end of everything. And so everybody else can rearrange
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:13.560]  deck chairs in the Titanic and everybody else can, you know, pretend like, oh, the liberals are just
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:21.160]  out of control or no, this is unified planetary world government cutting off the food supply,
[1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:26.280]  destroying the currencies, murdering the third world and who survives, flooding us to collapse
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:31.720]  the first world with the globalist posing as saviors at each leg of the attack that they launch.
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:39.960]  And that's it. That's it, ladies and gentlemen. So just get ready for it. I mean, I've tried to stop
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:45.160]  this. I tried to back this off. And I think there could be still a miracle that we get leadership
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:49.800]  that could stand up and speak out and address the new world order and address the globalist
[1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:54.440]  and have an open discussion about this. But oh, the New York Times might say something bad about
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:59.800]  a senator if they talk about great reset new world order, because only Klaus Schwab and Henry Kissinger
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:03.480]  and people are allowed to tell us about the world government only press. Charles can say we're going
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:07.320]  to have a world government and a military operation to put the planet under martial law
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:14.280]  and depopulate people. They're only allowed up on mountaintops like James Bond villains to say it.
[1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:20.200]  But the New York Times tells you're not allowed to talk about it. Soros can pose for NBC News
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.000]  and the Associated Press saying he takes State Department money and gives thousands of dollars
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:30.520]  to illegal aliens invading out of the Middle East and Africa into Europe. And the same thing,
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:34.680]  funding people to come to the Central America and come into North America.
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:41.400]  But if Lou Dobbs has on judicial watch showing the documents, well, he gets threatened with being
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:46.680]  fired. You're not allowed to talk about that. It's the same thing like we're allowed to talk about
[1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:51.160]  Klaus Schwab announcing they're going to microchip us and we'll own nothing and we'll have nothing
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:56.040]  and a one world religion and how pedophilia is going to be legalized. That's all what they're saying.
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:02.760]  But we're just supposed to sit here and pretend that's not going on so I can tune in
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:08.120]  and hear Senator Johnson going. A lot of people are having heart attacks and dying.
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:14.440]  I wish Joe Biden and people would have a soul and a heart and realize there's really bad side
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:20.680]  effects. Why don't you care? Well, because Senator Johnson, they were put in there because they like
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:32.040]  it, buddy boy. They're in on it, you see. You see how that works? This is a plan all over the world,
[1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:38.600]  systematic being rolled out. And we've got Tucker Carlson eating around the edges starting to go
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:45.080]  there and we have General Flynn hitting when they're on the head. We've got Alex Jones
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:51.800]  and we've got a few other people that are prominent that are letting everybody know we're in a war.
[1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:57.880]  James O'Keefe is exposing the COVID takeover and that's when they came after him right away. It's
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:06.440]  not over that diary. It's to stop those Pfizer investigations and you can bet your life on that.
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:13.320]  So people tell me and like I've said, oh man, you got a lot of courage fighting these people.
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:23.880]  I've got courage like in those movies where they get trapped in a room and the water's coming in
[1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:27.000]  and I'm trying to figure out a way out. I got courage trying to get out of this.
[1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:31.480]  The way we get out of this is admitting it and waking up to it and getting together and having
[1:27:31.480 --> 1:27:39.960]  some will, some survival instinct. I'll explain this again. I don't have any courage. What I have
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:46.360]  is survival instinct. Okay? That's what you need. Just like General Flynn says, courage is a decision.
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:52.040]  Well, yeah, deciding that you're going to survive and that means surviving my family. That means
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:58.120]  my culture. That means humanity. People come and go. Humanity is forever if we make it so. And so I
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:28:07.560]  am 100% ready to die, go to prison, whatever it takes to stand up for my family. And that means
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:13.240]  the human family. And that's why you see Robert Kennedy Jr. saying, this really comes down to
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.400]  being ready to give our lives up against this tyranny. We've got real tyranny. I mean, he
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:21.720]  didn't used to talk like that, but this is the place we are. This is where they've taken us.
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:26.520]  This is what we're living. I mean, they're killing millions of people with this shot right now.
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:31.000]  We're watching them. This isn't a movie where some evil government does it. This is
[1:28:32.120 --> 1:28:36.760]  the real world, folks. You're living in the depopulation operation. Bill Gates and Prince
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:41.880]  Philip and Prince Charles and Ted Turner and Oprah Winfrey and all them. And in Claus Schwab
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:45.720]  didn't meet all these years at the depopulation summits talking about how they wanted to kill
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:49.400]  you and your family because they were just doing that for no reason. They've been plotting and
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:54.600]  planning this. And now they've announced climate lockdowns. Oh, I didn't get to China and Biden.
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:28:57.640]  Hold that when we come back. Attention.
[1:29:01.480 --> 1:29:04.840]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:05.400]  Good, bro.
[1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:10.280]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:15.480]  the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's
[1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:19.960]  like we're living in a twilight zone. All right, Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:20.360]  Go ahead.
[1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:23.960]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:28.520]  one of the product. The X2 group does wonders. They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence
[1:29:28.520 --> 1:29:33.480]  about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the import. Tyler in Maine. You're on the
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:37.080]  ear. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:43.080]  Honored talk to you. Awesome. So personally, I wanted to do is say I love the products. Alpha
[1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:49.160]  Power even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So just
[1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:54.200]  number one for a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:05.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:09.800]  chemicals added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:15.320]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful. And the social
[1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:21.160]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:29.880]  who first came up with the boy. Is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[1:30:29.880 --> 1:30:34.920]  was hopeless. They need all the propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their
[1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:42.040]  cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:46.600]  of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars
[1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:51.160]  in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are
[1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:56.520]  manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark
[1:30:56.520 --> 1:31:02.280]  of the beast they just announced. It was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in
[1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:07.240]  game blueprint for global enslavement. And in that documentary, I predicted the globalists
[1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:13.160]  would establish world government by releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns
[1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:17.720]  and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society. And now they've done it.
[1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:23.560]  How did I know they would do it? Because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:28.280]  reports and internal meetings were leaked. You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group
[1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:33.560]  who's head at the time was Klaus Schwab and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were
[1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:39.000]  indeed planning to launch this great recent. Well, we're now living in the purposeful collapse
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:43.080]  of the third world and the first world, not attached to the tyrannical corporate world
[1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:49.480]  government, the total censorship, no due process, the structure of the family, and then incrementally
[1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:55.480]  more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating as vaccines to poisonous in the populace.
[1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:58.040]  This is what info wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:07.640]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity. I have decided that all of you
[1:32:07.640 --> 1:32:15.160]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe. But the injection is not ready.
[1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:24.760]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:32.680]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:41.160]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:50.040]  I own profitable. You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you give that special shot of
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:55.560]  freedom from copper will remove your immune system. So you'll be dependent on me for the
[1:32:55.560 --> 1:33:03.880]  rest of your miserable lives. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:03.880 --> 1:33:19.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:45.960]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen on this November 16th, Tuesday transmission.
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:52.600]  We have a very special guest. He's an inventor and scientist and started multiple billion
[1:33:52.600 --> 1:33:58.360]  dollar companies. Steve Kirsch has really been leading the fight exposing the fraud of the covid
[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:03.640]  shots. And now he's got evidence that I've got the articles right here. So the British news
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:07.800]  over 60 times increase in pro sports adverse events since vaccines rolled out.
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:13.880]  And we're also going to be looking at the fact that he says he has proof that indeed
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:19.480]  Governor Newsom did get Guillain beret from the injection and that there's photographic and video
[1:34:19.480 --> 1:34:23.080]  evidence. And I've actually looked at it. It's clear. So that's coming up. He'll be popping in
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:28.600]  next hour. I want Troy will be co hosting with me. We're going to talk about the war on liberty
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:33.080]  and in just how serious it is and what's coming next in the fourth hour. And then like I said,
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:38.760]  I was going to have Tim Poole on today. He's going to be on Thursday instead. And Mike Cernovich is
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:45.560]  going to be here Thursday. It's in Wednesday and a lot more this week. And tonight I'm going to leave
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:49.640]  it as a surprise, but there'll be some other interesting podcasters that we're going to be
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:55.160]  co hosting with here in Austin. Just look for that. It will be linked up on info wars.com
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:35:01.000]  by seven o'clock central this evening. That should be informative. That's definitely why the old
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.080]  dinosaur media is so jealous and trying to take us off the air. They just can't stand the fact that
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:10.840]  we were supposed to be the example of a populace being crushed and destroyed. And instead, in many
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:15.320]  ways, we've just gotten stronger thanks to God's good graces and people spread the word. Now,
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:21.400]  let's talk about Biden's two plus hour long summit with Xi Jinping,
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:30.760]  the declared dictator of communist China built up and empowered in one way trade deals
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:36.440]  in the last really 60 years, but it's accelerated in the last 30 years by the United States. So
[1:35:37.240 --> 1:35:43.480]  there is Xi Jinping. And I love how they set up the camera shots where Biden's got the
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:47.080]  communist Chinese flag beside him. That's just perfect, isn't it?
[1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:55.320]  You've got Xi with the American flag over behind him. What a joke. But you know what the big takeaway
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:36:01.560]  from this is? There's a lot of takeaways, but one of them is a total puppet and runs absolutely
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:08.360]  nothing and is a front man and a pedophile. And as a degenerate, evil family and sold the country
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:14.920]  out to Russia and China. And the other one is the actual dictator for life of the most populace
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:20.040]  country in the world and even runs the global social credit score program and got his Chinese
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:28.040]  government run QR code program adopted by the UN and adopted by the Davos group rolled out worldwide
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:36.440]  one month ago and the UK and Canada and Australia are adopting it while Australia shoots its mouth
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:41.720]  off about how, oh, they're at war with China and they're going to stand up to China. Yeah, right.
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:48.920]  They're totally in bed with it. And so Xi made a bunch of threats, a bunch of red line statements
[1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:57.320]  about war. Biden groveled just pathetic. Biden's only good at groping children and, you know, calling
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:37:04.360]  the FBI and SWAT teams on moms that don't like pedophile drag queen story time or a man in a
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:10.040]  dress raping a little girl in the bathroom. Oh, by the way, remember Obama said that was all fake.
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:15.000]  I'm going to get to that next segment. Obama said nobody in the New York Times said nobody
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:20.520]  raped a girl in Loudoun County. Certainly a man didn't they said now they're seeing a woman with
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:25.080]  a penis raptor. Yeah, seriously, that's all just gaslighting by this cult.
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:33.560]  Oh, what do you hate women with ding dongs? Give me a break. This is about I don't hate anybody
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:38.760]  for what they look like or who they are, but I do hate people for their deeds. So I don't care
[1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:44.040]  if it'd be a woman with a steel bar or a man with a penis, you don't rape women and now it's all
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:53.480]  confirmed. But guilty, but guilty to raping her going in a unisex bathroom and raping her
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:59.560]  annually and vaginally. And now you know why daddy was mad when the school denied it even happened
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:03.960]  when it turns out in their internal emails, they knew and made the decision a week before
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:11.320]  to cover it up. He shows up going you maniacs rape my daughter. They go first officer, he's a girl
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:19.240]  second off arrest him. And Obama goes out, we got the video and says, oh, it's culture war.
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:25.000]  That didn't happen in the New York Times. Like, yeah. So I'm the devil for questioning a mass
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.840]  shooting and every other big event because most of them are fake or provocative turd.
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:35.400]  Jesse Smollett, WMDs in Iraq, babies and incubators may go on for hours, golf, the Tonkin,
[1:38:35.400 --> 1:38:42.440]  the Roe v Wade baby will never died. But I'm the devil. I got to be taken out of here.
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:53.880]  But oh, oh, the New York Times can say, oh, no, no, no, the father just made it up. Got the articles
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:39:00.280]  right here. Now I just said we should investigate these mass shootings and these events.
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:06.200]  And it turns out the police stood down in Florida at the Parkland shooting and I got real students
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:09.800]  on that said that that kid was running around for years saying he's going to shoot everybody
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:13.480]  and they did nothing. And he was part of this minority program where you're allowed to commit
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.600]  crimes and never go to jail. Remember that? So CNN said I had actors on. They weren't students at
[1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:24.840]  the school. They were real. So CNN says real kids are actors. And then they say that I'm saying kids
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:32.920]  are actors. But I didn't say that about Parkland. And David Hawke runs around saying that.
[1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:40.120]  The people from the Aurora shooting say that I said nobody was killed there.
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:45.160]  They go around the news saying I do. I never said that. I said the guy's dad ran a mind control
[1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:52.760]  project, headed it up the man human brain interface for NASA super secret. And that he told people
[1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:57.400]  that Denver Post reported he was under mind control. I don't know if he really was or not.
[1:39:57.400 --> 1:40:03.000]  I know the Unabomber was under CIA mind control. That's admitted. The LA Times. Did you even know
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:08.200]  that? But that's how this works. Every time there's a mass shooting. Oh, Jones denied it.
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:14.600]  No, noted. So that's the way this craziness works. But here is, I said to do it next
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:22.040]  segment, but I'm already getting to it. Let's get back to GG ping. So Biden's respectful 3.5
[1:40:22.040 --> 1:40:28.680]  hour. I'm sorry. I said two plus hour. Virtual summit with G's focuses on managing strategic
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:34.920]  risk like Taiwan. And then G made a bunch of threats about using military action if the U.S.
[1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:40.120]  tried to defend Taiwan or if our ships go to the waters, which they're now claiming the entire
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:48.760]  South China Sea all the way down to Vietnam and Indonesia. Wow. Chinese dictators. GG ping threatens
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:53.960]  Biden during meeting. Biden fails to make any breakthroughs because he's a puppet. I mean,
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:59.240]  look at that photo. Those are everything you need to know. And notice, whether it's the New York
[1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:05.160]  Times or CBS News, they all cropped it to not show an American flag. Now we look at that and go,
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:09.800]  look what a commie he is. Look what a trader he is. But you know that every photo is him with just
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:18.680]  that flag. And why do they do that? Because they're now going to get ready to get rid of him. He's
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:24.680]  served his usefulness. Now they're like, oh, we got him Kamala and Buddha judge. Hey, Buddha judge
[1:41:24.680 --> 1:41:30.760]  had a baby. His husband laid in the hospital bed, thought you were so dumb. They put on hospital
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:38.040]  scrubs and lay in a bed. Look, we had a baby. All part of the brainwashing. It's some kid they got
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:47.080]  from somebody else. Oh, here we are with our multi-month old baby. We just had it. You know,
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:52.760]  men have babies all about the gaslighting, all about the mind control, all about the control. Oh,
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:57.880]  it's okay if Biden steps down because Buddha judge is gay. Oh my gosh. Would you have that on his
[1:41:57.880 --> 1:42:05.080]  resume? Oh my gosh. I mean, can I be vice president? I tell you what, I'm gay too, folks. I need to be
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:09.160]  vice president now. You know, like Tim Cook is to run death camps worse than the world on record.
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:14.760]  Worst factories in the world, suicide nets, forced abortion, 16, 18 hour workdays, forced
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:21.560]  drugging of the slaves, people living in container, but it's all right. Tim Cook is what? What's the
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:24.920]  answer? G-A-Y. Anywhere's a black turtleneck.
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:35.880]  By the way, when we put up joke memes on the screen, we'll probably have a fact check. Say,
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:42.280]  Jones claimed Buddha judge's baby was a grand dragon. It's called a joke. I mean, hell, the
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:46.520]  Democrats support selling baby body parts. Maybe Buddha judge will chop his baby up and sell the
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:50.680]  parts. I hope he doesn't. But I mean, as long as he keeps the baby comfortable, it's okay. Like
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:58.040]  Governor of Virginia said, right? I mean, after all, babies aren't human, right? I'm up here working

[1:43:56.440 --> 1:44:03.640]  special. We here at info wars are proud to announce the first ever kava kava root supplement that
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:09.960]  is now available at infowarstore.com. Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:14.840]  health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific islands for its
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:21.080]  relaxation and euphoric effects. According to ancient Samoan legend, kava was given as a gift
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:27.400]  by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:32.760]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:38.200]  up a little. Nowadays kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:43.880]  The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava,
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:49.560]  but other herbs including but not limited to German chamomile, organic skullcap,
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:55.560]  and balearion root. We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by
[1:44:55.560 --> 1:45:04.840]  visiting infowarstore.com. God created each and every one of us with free will. But we look at the
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:10.600]  world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast. Everything that it's attempting to do is
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:16.440]  built around getting rid of our free will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very
[1:45:16.440 --> 1:45:25.560]  bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them. They want control
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:31.000]  of procreation. They want control of the relationships between men and women. They want to bring a form
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:38.040]  of living death to our society and our civilization. All of us were formed and made in God's mind,
[1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:43.240]  in God's image, and given free will. And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:48.760]  by God to be alive in this special time so that you could make the right decision in free will
[1:45:48.760 --> 1:45:57.160]  and stand against evil. And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:04.600]  I want to explain something that is absolutely heat understanding our world. It's very,
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:09.720]  very simple, but the multiple don't know. The privately owned central banks of the world
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:17.160]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:24.520]  them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual property, energy. They're using it to buy people,
[1:46:24.520 --> 1:46:29.720]  to buy influence. And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:34.680]  leverage that manipulated market so they never allowed that money to get into the general
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:39.560]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation. Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are
[1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:45.800]  flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything, not to have the companies operate,
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:51.000]  but to actually shut them down and force the collapse of civilization, making the companies
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.880]  they do fund be the only things left handed. This is the great reset. This is what's happening now.
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:47:11.800]  Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:26.200]  Let's take a look now at the incredible deception that we've been witnessing with the written house
[1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:34.040]  trial. The lies, the attempts to get witnesses to engage in perjury, all of it has come out,
[1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:42.680]  all of it has been on display of what a George Soros funded worm will do. But just imagine if
[1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:49.320]  you had judges cut from the same piece of rotten cloth that this prosecutor in the written house
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:59.320]  case is, you would have what's happening to me in Texas and in Connecticut. Total complete lies.
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:02.440]  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this now, but I read the ruling last night by the
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:09.880]  Connecticut judge, says we gave them no bank records that they weren't real. Really? I'm lying,
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:14.520]  huh? You didn't prove that. It's not true. It's incredible. Says we wouldn't give them Google
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:19.080]  Analytics. I'm going to talk about it, but let me explain something. Google Analytics is like
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:25.000]  Google, but the back end of it. We never even used it. I mean, we barely ever even looked at it.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:28.920]  Back when we had Google AdSense on stuff, but we did go look up when they said,
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:32.520]  how much money did you make off Sandy Hook? We found the articles. It's $300 something bucks.
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:38.680]  When we had Google ads on the site, we're like, okay, $300 bucks. That's not true. Your whole
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:50.920]  empire is built on it. The news said it. We're like, okay, I guess access to the Google password?
[1:48:50.920 --> 1:48:55.080]  Well, the contract with Google says you can't do that. No, we don't want that. Why don't you pay
[1:48:55.080 --> 1:48:59.640]  Google $300,000 for a license to give us full access to Google Analytics? Because we never had
[1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:07.000]  that. We had the free version. We're like, uh, no, okay, you're defaulted. I mean, that's what goes
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:11.400]  on with these people. And I mean, imagine it's some maniac judge can't find her.
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:18.360]  You know what? Both hands probably just, I mean, I can't tell if they're like super evil or super
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:24.040]  dumb or probably both, but I'm going to stop ranting about this. Owen's here going to be here in the
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:28.200]  fourth hour. We're going to get a whole bunch of stuff, not just that, but Owen Schreuer was
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:33.720]  defaulted in Texas by this same judge that tried to block the Texas abortion law and all the rest
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:36.840]  of it, even though she had no standing to do it. She's been overturned by the Supreme Court and a
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:44.920]  bunch of them in the state. Owen never got subpoenaed, never got deposed, never got contacted. He's a
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:51.960]  separate suit, but added to this and they defaulted him. Imagine you never get a subpoena, never get
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:50:00.760]  a contact, and then they just default you. That's total judicial misconduct. It's judicial crimes,
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:06.520]  in my view. And they just think it's funny. The newspapers think it's funny. It's all funny.
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:11.800]  It's like that AP article three years ago saying, Jones just lost a lawsuit for the book he wrote.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:16.760]  Nobody died at Sandy Hook. We call up AP, they go, Suez, had a law firm sent him a letter,
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:21.080]  they go, go ahead. We didn't write the book. We're not in the book. Doesn't matter,
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:26.200]  because they ran it everywhere that I lost. I lost. I lost. That's why people walk up to
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:29.160]  me on the street. Happened right in front of my security guys a few months ago in Florida
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:34.520]  and say, I hate your guts. You murdered those children. I go, what children? You know the ones
[1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:41.400]  in Connecticut. You, I mean, you support killing them. Nobody knows Adam Lanz's name. It's all me.
[1:50:41.400 --> 1:50:45.800]  That's mind control. And sure, those people really don't count. They're like zombies to believe it,
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:49.560]  but those are the folks taking on the shots. Those are the ones buying in the propaganda.
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:53.160]  Those are the ones that, you know, don't support free speech or your second amendment or anything.
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:51:00.520]  And so, I mean, I mean, I've not just talked to my law firms. I've talked to a bunch of big ones
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:05.960]  nationwide and they go, yeah, we've never seen that. We've never seen people be sued when you
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:09.400]  didn't say their names in Texas. And the Texas Supreme Court said, yeah, we don't care the
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:16.120]  law says you got to say the names. The suit goes forward because the Republican establishment
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:20.840]  wants to get me folks. It's not just the Democrats. The Republicans just want to pendulum the swing
[1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:27.320]  and they get back in. They don't want Donald Trump type Republicans or Rand Paul types that
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:31.720]  are the populist movement. They, and I'm not saying the whole Supreme Court, but that's what's
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:37.880]  going on. They're just a bunch of political operatives on average who want to stay safe. Well,
[1:51:37.880 --> 1:51:41.960]  you don't stay safe when the whole country's being taken over and things are falling apart
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:46.920]  with us. But that's why we've been maneuvered into this position. And I've got the clips come up the
[1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:54.280]  fourth hour on MSNBC, you name it, London Independent, you name it saying we are going to
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:01.240]  now shut down Fox News and Newsmax and OAN using the precedent we're going to set in the Alex Jones
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:06.120]  case. Because no matter what you give the judges, they're going to say default and then you don't
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:11.880]  get a jury trial on whether you're guilty or not. You get a jury trial on how much money you owe.
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:19.240]  So this is their plan, ladies and gentlemen, the New York Times can get up there and say the
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:25.400]  father's lying. Nobody touched his daughter. It's made up even though they knew there was an arrest
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:30.360]  and all the rest of it. And then he reportedly raped somebody else in another school. Now it's
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:36.200]  all confirmed he's pled guilty, pled to it. They can come out knowingly and lie. That's clear
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:41.000]  defamation right there. But still, what's the damages? But see the courts will know, oh,
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:44.840]  that's the New York Times. Oh, they can premeditatedly do that.
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:53.480]  But Alex Jones questions public events. Well, that's not allowed because he's not the New York
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:53:00.360]  Times. So here's some more examples of this. MSNBC airs written house prosecution closing
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:09.400]  arguments, but not the defense. And Google and Twitter and Facebook and others delete accounts
[1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:15.400]  showing any of the defense. That was all over the news. YouTube just got rid of the like comments,
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:21.480]  hit them, because Biden was 99% negative. And Alex Jones was 97% positive. Literally,
[1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:29.880]  97% positive votes all over YouTube, everywhere. 97%. Some videos have 400,000 comments, and it's
[1:53:29.880 --> 1:53:38.040]  97.6% Alex Jones. Biden, it's 99% anti Biden. They don't like that. They don't like you being able
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:45.720]  to express reality. It continues video. Socky refuses to answer questions. Why did Biden suggest
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:55.320]  Kyle Rittenhouse is a white supremacist? Oh, yeah. Rittenhouse jury has begun their deliberations.
[1:53:55.320 --> 1:54:00.040]  Here it is. YouTube creator slams companies removal of dislike button as stupid move. Well,
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:03.960]  it's not, I mean, it's an authoritarian move. Can't let the average slaves have speech.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:10.440]  And you know, people are calling Ben a grandstander and stuff because all he could have just pled
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:15.560]  the fifth. You know, he's got a lot of courage facing years in prison for this fake garbage.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:19.480]  And I know he didn't do anything wrong on January 6. Nobody wanted violence. And I know the left
[1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:23.240]  provocative turd it. So I think him taking the bull by the horns and getting in the fiery furnace
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:29.320]  takes a lot of will. And so I've been critical abandoned on some things and Roger Stone stuff.
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:34.840]  But I mean, he's under attack. His show does a lot of good work. And so I, you know, I think
[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:41.880]  that's the strategy not backing down. You know, on the Sandy Hook thing, a bunch of them reached out
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:45.320]  to me. It was on the news. They said, just stop saying our children didn't die before they were
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:49.880]  soothing. And I said, yeah, I could see how mass shootings happened. I never really made a big,
[1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:53.640]  you know, my big thing about it. I'm not the Sandy Hook guy. And I said, okay, I'm sorry.
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:59.560]  I think your children died. Soot me immediately. Soot me immediately. Oh my God, you admit you
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:06.760]  lied. You see, and then use that to deplatform me and then run around and say I was still talking
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:12.440]  about them, even though they have attached themselves to me and are riding on our coattails
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:16.600]  to promote gun control that that is the gun control groups. And everybody sees that and
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:20.760]  knows that. So just keep beating the dead horse and keep beating the critical race theory and
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.880]  keep Sam, we're all white supremacists left. Just keep doing what you're doing because it's not
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:29.880]  working. And if those of us up front are willing to take the pain and just be stalwarts and step
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:34.920]  into the champion boots, we're going to win this fight. But they think we'll just target their leaders
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:38.520]  so they have no leaders. So we need to support the leaders in the fight
[1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:44.200]  against tearing. And so I would support Roger Stone, I'd support Bannon, I'd support Trump,
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:47.720]  I'd support us, I'd support really info wars is the most hardcore and the most hated.
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.960]  Pepper Carlson is great. I would support him as well infowarstore.com. Let me tell you about that.

[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:35.960]  group is public in its former head shown the steering committee is claus Schwab and he has set
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:41.240]  up the great reset in global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:46.120]  globalist head on about the fact that you're worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover
[1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:51.320]  we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat em easily unrun contact tracers aren't coming
[1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:56.520]  they're here all over the world from australia to the united states from canada to germany
[1:58:56.520 --> 1:59:00.600]  these tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your house
[1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:06.840]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:11.720]  and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[1:59:11.720 --> 1:59:16.040]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety this is nothing
[1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:20.440]  less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality
[1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:25.480]  faraday cages many of which are made here in america and are very compliant meaning us government

[2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:11.320]  all right coming up next segment he's written some amazing articles steve kersh will join us again
[2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:16.200]  if you get to the bottom of what's really happening with these deadly cupboard shots
[2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:22.040]  that's coming up so much on that front and speaking of that i i mentioned this earlier
[2:00:22.040 --> 2:00:27.480]  i only played part of it we went to break i i want to play what senator ron johnson had to say
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:33.560]  about people being in denial uh who who bought it is and are now doubling down he's talking about
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:39.720]  he's talking about trump as well and this is really losing trump a lot of support uh and uh
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:46.760]  america's awake and is getting pissed so here is what senator johnson had to say president
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:51.160]  biden won't admit he's wrong when he says that this is a pandemic of the invax that if you get
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:56.520]  the vaccine all is going to be well the heads of these agencies will never admit they were going
[2:00:56.520 --> 2:01:03.480]  to be they were wrong my colleagues who voted for the vaccines who have done videos encouraging
[2:01:03.480 --> 2:01:07.800]  everybody to get vaccinated which by the way that might be the right advice for certain people
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:13.080]  they don't want to admit they're wrong doctors physicians who've recommended to patients to get
[2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:18.360]  the vaccine don't want to admit that their recommendation might have caused a severe harm
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:30.280]  it's understandable i understand that human tendency but that doesn't overcome the basic
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:38.280]  humanity of acknowledging reality and doing everything we can as as a society those of us
[2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:45.560]  that voted for operation war speed those of us that encourage vaccination we have to admit
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:55.000]  there's a side effect here and has changed people's lives forever so again i'm begging anybody watching
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:01.880]  this today or via video let these stories be seen let these stories be heard let them be
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:10.840]  believed so that it's society we can do the right thing we can acknowledge it we can put even just
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:17.400]  a fraction of the time and effort and resources as we've put into the shutdowns and the mass mandates
[2:02:17.400 --> 2:02:23.080]  and the vaccine mandates and the vaccine development and the administration of it if we just take a
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:27.800]  fraction of that and apply it to research and treatment and by the way a vaccine injury fund
[2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:35.480]  that actually compensates those who did what everybody asked them to do for them themselves
[2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:40.280]  for the good for the good of their neighbors for the good of society the least we can do with the
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:47.560]  trillions of dollars we've already allocated and spent the least we can do is acknowledge their
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:53.560]  pain help them recover and compensate them for their injuries well that's right back in the mid
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:57.960]  80s they passed the vaccine damage fund that's paid out billions and billions of dollars but oh
[2:02:57.960 --> 2:03:04.040]  because this is experimental it's not covered so oh nobody's you know that's gotten sick or hurt
[2:03:04.040 --> 2:03:10.360]  or died there's no compensation and so now we're having this discussion and we're going to
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:18.360]  give us money a band-aid after you shoot them they're not going to admit that they're going to just
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:23.960]  keep steam rolling with the global ID and the carbon tax and the social credits core tied to
[2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:30.200]  the vaccine passport and just keep rolling forward and the same thing you see in the UK and the same
[2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:35.560]  thing you see in Australia and the same thing you see in places like Austria where they're saying
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:41.960]  it's checkpoints and and and you can't go outside if you don't have your vaccines and then of course
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:47.960]  it's boosters and more and more and more that's really a dystopic nightmare science fiction hell
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:53.960]  and that's really where we are you could say oh they meant well or oh they didn't mean well it was
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:03:58.680]  all a big plan well it all was the plan and operation lock stuff but yeah a lot of people
[2:03:58.680 --> 2:04:04.040]  mid-level are going along with it doesn't matter at the end of the day they're not going to
[2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:08.040]  double or going along with it doesn't matter at the end of the day this is a very dystopic thing
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:15.000]  that's happening and it's about the population all right we're going to go to our guest of the
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  next 45 minutes or so and then I got a bunch of news I'm going to hit in that last segment of the
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:22.760]  hour the no one's sure it's coming in studio to cover the waterfront with me and we've got so much
[2:04:22.760 --> 2:04:28.440]  to hit there that's important but Steve Kirsch is our guest when we come back over a 60x increase in
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.320]  sports pro sports adverse events since the vaccines rolled out and he's written a big
[2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:36.360]  article saying we got some of the video too I think I need to tell the crew about that
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:41.320]  I've shown his face looking like it is somewhat paralyzed and different with Governor Newsom
[2:04:41.320 --> 2:04:46.920]  and where he was missing for 13 days we'll be right back with Steve Kirsch on the other side
[2:04:46.920 --> 2:04:52.280]  infowars.com demonize for a reason because the truth lives there stay with us
[2:04:52.280 --> 2:05:03.960]  the engineer the CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines
[2:05:03.960 --> 2:05:11.800]  are working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:17.960]  evil groups are they know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:24.680]  and Moderna's in trouble as well they know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation
[2:05:24.680 --> 2:05:30.120]  agenda in fact evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons
[2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:36.680]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking
[2:05:36.680 --> 2:05:43.160]  up the weapons work a little too good they're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars
[2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:48.680]  but instead they're making too big of a noise but it's too late for a return back now they're
[2:05:48.680 --> 2:05:53.800]  coming after our children so it's up to us to protect our little children or god will not
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:06:14.120]  look favorably on us remember god is watching from the front lines of the information war
[2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:22.760]  it's alex jones now the call written house things got everybody glued to it and i know we get high
[2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:28.680]  ratings and we just carried the trial but we really didn't because yes our right to self-defense is
[2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:32.360]  important and yes call is a great guy and yes they lied about him and the truth is coming out
[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:38.200]  but if you look at worldwide martial law and the carbon taxes and india announcing carbon
[2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:43.560]  lockdowns and now the west is saying it and if you look at england announcing forced inoculations
[2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:48.280]  basically uh or you can't buy or sell or leave your house i mean they just joined austria and
[2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:53.080]  saying they're gonna now announce that that to me is the big enchilada i don't know about you
[2:06:53.720 --> 2:07:00.440]  then i've got a whole stack of news here with uh fda and cdc documents admitting massive increase
[2:07:00.440 --> 2:07:07.160]  in microcarditis uh in young people particularly boys so i wanted to talk about that first with
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:11.880]  steve karstin coming up we've got some of the videos of nucem and his face looking partially
[2:07:11.880 --> 2:07:17.160]  paralyzed as sources had said that usually goes away in about two weeks and also that his children
[2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:22.120]  aren't vaccinated steve karstin has written about that as well on his sub-stack account but i wanted
[2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:28.360]  to hit just all this cardiac news and information coming out first but yeah that photo there you
[2:07:28.360 --> 2:07:33.320]  can really see that that looks he does look paralyzed it is different doesn't he has the
[2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:39.000]  dimple on the other side not on that side really dramatic or maybe he had some plastic surgery
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:42.920]  mishap point as he was gone two weeks and something happened steve karstin is the floor
[2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:47.400]  anthropologist and executive director of the covet 19 early treatment fund and also the vaccine safety
[2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:51.240]  research foundation he's the inventor of the optical mouse and one of the first internet
[2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:56.520]  search engines info seek remember using that he has founded seven high tech companies two with
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:08:02.040]  multi-billion dollar market caps steve is currently focused on safe and effective ways to end the
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:07.480]  pandemic he received his bsms and electrical engineering computer science from mit in 1980
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:12.600]  he was been featured in 60 minutes for his work on funding flu voxamine i just think i'm saying that
[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:17.560]  right one of the first repurposed drugs to be shown in phase three clinical trials has
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:22.920]  definitely reduced the risk hospitalization and death from covet steve kersh dot sub-stack dot
[2:08:22.920 --> 2:08:32.280]  com and twitter at sd kersh k i r s c h and on gab at sd kersh all right steve great to have you
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:37.720]  back powerful interview a few weeks ago so much to get into i know you've got a lot to cover but
[2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:44.600]  well humor me and dive into these amazing numbers we see coming out in these these FDA panel meetings
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:52.600]  where they're admitting it but it's getting almost no coverage well you know the these people are
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:09:00.600]  just rubber stamps for um for these risk benefit analyses which are just awful you know we show
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:08.120]  that uh toby rogers was so disgusted he decided to do his own risk benefit analysis dr toby rogers
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:12.680]  and he's an expert on risk benefit analysis he thought the fizer risk benefit analysis
[2:09:12.680 --> 2:09:19.880]  was one of the shoddiest pieces of work that he has ever seen in his career so he decided to
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:26.760]  do the risk benefit analysis that should have been done he discovered that will kill 117 kids to
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:35.560]  save one life uh in in his calculation and he had and his sub-stack was read by over 20 000 people
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:40.120]  and everybody was complimenting him on the great job that he did and nobody was pointing out any
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:46.600]  errors so these fda panels they don't know what's going on they they basically have to rubber stamp
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:50.840]  it or they're going to be kicked off the panel and and i have an admission of that from one of the
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:57.000]  panel members who basically said that i mean he didn't say it to me he sent it to to someone
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:02.600]  is very very trusted source close friend of his who relayed um that that to me and you know it
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:07.640]  explains why these people are voting for it they basically don't want to get kicked off the committee
[2:10:07.640 --> 2:10:14.440]  um so you know this is just a terrible you know the the number needed to vaccinate for kids is
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:21.240]  close to is it's over 600 000 it's one of the largest if not the largest uh number needed to
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:28.280]  vaccinate in in history and of course when you're using a vaccine that's 800 times more deadly than
[2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:34.920]  the smallpox vaccine you know it's it's just a complete disaster and in terms of the uh the
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:42.120]  numbers for the the the the fda committee i mean and to top it off the myocarditis these people
[2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:48.120]  who are on the committee actually believe that there are fewer cases of myocarditis this year
[2:10:48.840 --> 2:10:54.040]  than last year because they think that the number of cases of myocarditis is actually
[2:10:54.040 --> 2:11:00.680]  lower with the vaccine and the risk is lower if you get vaccinated then if you just get covid
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:08.920]  it's completely backwards i mean i've gotten um messages from people saying it's a hundred times
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:18.360]  worse now than it was before i mean where were these the people who are on these committees
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:23.560]  they're not living in the same world we're we're in and in fact the risk of myocarditis for example
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:30.760]  if you calculated out using the numbers from theirs and using the cdc methodology for calculating
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:38.600]  the under reporting factor which is 41 you get one in 317 boys aged 16 to 17 that will end up
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:42.440]  with myocarditis and what we don't know is what's going to happen in a year from now
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:47.320]  we don't know if 20 percent of those boys will be dead we don't know whether it's 10 percent we
[2:11:47.320 --> 2:11:51.720]  don't know whether it's five percent we'll know in a year and we'll know in five years whether the
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:57.880]  rate normally for vile myocarditis is 40 to 50 percent die after five years we won't know that
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:05.080]  for five years we'll find out we're in the biggest experiment ever and what's tragic is that already
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:12.440]  25 percent of the kids five to 11 have been vaccinated so they've done a great job of
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:17.480]  convincing parents that this thing is safe and effective and you know it's hardly the case you
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:24.520]  look at theirs they're over 4 000 symptoms which are elevated by a factor of 10 or more versus
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:30.680]  any previous vaccine in the last five years so that's pretty troubling and nobody wants to explain
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:36.280]  or even talk about that at all I mean this is this is a complete disaster these vaccines are
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:43.560]  you know should not be given to anyone under any circumstances any age any comorbidity the evidence
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:49.000]  just doesn't support that and nobody seems to want to debate me on this I have tried to
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.480]  debate anyone in the medical community who any you know because they accuse me of spreading
[2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:58.440]  misinformation but nobody wants to debate me that's the best way to silence me is to debate me nobody
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:07.080]  nobody in mainstream academia nobody in the CDC nobody in the FDA they all want to just
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:12.360]  ignore everything I'm saying because they don't want to confront what's going on Steve Kersh is
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:19.400]  our guest Steve I mean you're obviously you know a hard-working guy a successful person
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:23.880]  that saw a problem and has been out trying to inform people I know for over a year
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:29.640]  and now we we see more and more people waking up and and saying yeah we're not taking this
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:34.040]  now they're wanting people to take booster shots according to the medical doctors and
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:37.400]  research scientists I've interviewed they're saying that we're going to see even bigger
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:42.920]  problems with the booster shots we've already seen that in places like Israel now they're
[2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:48.520]  trying to say oh we have a vaccine passport in the UK that says you've had your boosters as well
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:56.360]  I mean it seems like the the the big pharma is is just in a crazy frenzy to dominate the population
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:02.040]  but I see this leading to really their total vilification I saw one FDA board member a few
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:07.080]  months ago saying in a quote of course they got off the board saying you're going to destroy
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:11.880]  belief and and the credibility of vaccines for generations I mean if you actually wanted to
[2:14:11.880 --> 2:14:17.480]  destroy medicine you'd act like this oh yeah absolutely and that's exactly what they're doing
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:22.040]  but it's not just in vaccines people are not going to believe their doctors anymore
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:27.000]  right that's that that's what's going to come out of this they're not going to believe the doctors
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.280]  they're not going to believe anything that congress says they're not going to believe anything that
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:34.920]  the mainstream media says and they're not going to believe any of the three letter agencies the FDA
[2:14:34.920 --> 2:14:40.760]  the CDC and the NIH that's what's going to come out of this and you know it's happening now I mean
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:47.000]  people are seeing sports personalities you know people on the field I mean you can't hide that stuff
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  they're they're basically dropping dead at a rate that's 60 times higher than previous rates
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:58.280]  you can't explain that I mean people try and say oh well it's it's cannabis use
[2:14:59.640 --> 2:15:05.960]  or it's 5g or like you know see all these explanations are all hand-waving explanations
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:10.760]  because that's all they've got they don't have any data to support their theory
[2:15:10.760 --> 2:15:19.400]  um this these athletes are dying at a 60 times higher rate than before guess what
[2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:27.640]  VAERS shows VAERS shows that cardiac events are up 450 times normal so I was about to say I know
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:32.840]  you're the statistician but I've seen numbers that it's higher than 60 percent increases in all this
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:43.080]  weirdness 60 times 60 times that's 6000 percent 64th 64 hundred percent so that's 64 times normal
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:47.800]  Steve let's let's walk through all this and talk about your big story on the governor because I mean
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:53.880]  once I saw it you can see the photos he's clearly looks like people that have the Bell's palsy we'll
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:16:00.040]  be right back if you're concerned about the power grid and cognitive dissonance is a major issue
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:06.280]  amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a
[2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:11.640]  family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate
[2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:17.560]  fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:23.880]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:30.360]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:38.120]  system recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:45.240]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now I can
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:51.960]  have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get your ultimate
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:58.280]  fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot com we've all heard about
[2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:04.360]  the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:08.680]  they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came
[2:17:08.680 --> 2:17:13.800]  for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:17.800]  for him there was nobody else to stand up well the global social credit score that china's putting
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:22.120]  in that's banning people to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:26.680]  you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under
[2:17:26.680 --> 2:17:31.720]  the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now they're saying it's going to be a
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:36.120]  carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and decide where you can
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:40.920]  go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything
[2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:46.280]  so again the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:50.280]  they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:54.360]  we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:59.800]  this horrible technocracy run by the globalists why do my enemies hate me so much why do the
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:06.120]  globalists hate you so much why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom
[2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:12.520]  that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:19.640]  their world government their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:26.440]  and due process injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:32.440]  bill gates you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:38.440]  they started a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away
[2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:44.040]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them
[2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:49.080]  the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about
[2:18:49.080 --> 2:18:53.880]  corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack we
[2:18:53.880 --> 2:19:01.240]  have any chance of beating these people the engineers at bio pros are very excited to announce
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:07.720]  a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer market since their rollout of their first
[2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:15.320]  product almost a year ago they come out with four new products bio drain pro bio rv pro
[2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:23.320]  bio marine pro and bio porta pro for decades oil companies and other major chemical corporations
[2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:29.800]  have been using patented naturally occurring specially bred bacteria to eat oil spills
[2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:36.280]  and other toxic waste disasters that's how powerful these naturally occurring microbes are
[2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:41.960]  the bio pro system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only work once these
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:47.800]  bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank and now it's available for the general
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:54.520]  public's use for the first time on the retail market exclusively available at the bio pros.com
[2:19:54.520 --> 2:20:02.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:24.760 --> 2:20:36.040]  all right ladies and gentlemen one of the most articulate well researched people out there
[2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:42.840]  exposing this new covid world we live in is with us steve kersh and find him on substack at
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:48.600]  steve kersh dot substack dot com and we can introduce them now if you want or any of the other huge
[2:20:48.600 --> 2:20:53.240]  breaking things you know surrounding covid most my listeners understand this is important and they
[2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:57.640]  say hey we want more news about all the things that are happening as they see this is the biggest
[2:20:57.640 --> 2:21:03.480]  thing of our time everything else is is is basically a sub derivative of that this is how
[2:21:03.480 --> 2:21:06.920]  the corporations are getting the power it's a big pharma's taking over it's how they're
[2:21:06.920 --> 2:21:12.520]  establishing world ids it's how they're bulldozing our entire bill of rights and constitution as robert
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:16.920]  kennedy jr said all that's left now seem to be the second amendment and he's not alluding towards
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:22.120]  violence it's just they're basically everything's getting bulldozed what else is front and center
[2:21:22.120 --> 2:21:26.680]  for you and your research and then i want to get into your article gabin neustom is lying
[2:21:26.680 --> 2:21:31.720]  about his vaccine injury and here's how i will prove it to you very powerful article you convince
[2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:39.400]  me yeah well um happy to to jump into to the gabin thing but but let me just start with
[2:21:40.120 --> 2:21:45.240]  we people shouldn't believe anything that i say uh they shouldn't believe anything you say or
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:50.840]  anything that's on cnn they should check out this stuff for themselves directly right don't
[2:21:50.840 --> 2:21:57.480]  don't believe us check out the facts and so i'm an analysis uh that was done on the various system
[2:21:57.480 --> 2:22:03.400]  that's the definitive database on adverse events uh there's an analysis on my substack people should
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:09.160]  check out that analysis and run their own queries and and verify for themselves that what i'm saying
[2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:16.840]  matches reality and you know the neurological events um the cardiovascular events the female
[2:22:16.840 --> 2:22:22.520]  reproductive system events i mean those were way at the top of the charts i mean these are elevated
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:30.680]  by uh over 8 000 times normal for female reproductive problems uh after taking these vaccines it's
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:34.680]  something the cdc just doesn't tell you about but it's right there and you can do the various
[2:22:34.680 --> 2:22:40.520]  queries to verify this yourself um so all this information is in plain sight but they
[2:22:40.520 --> 2:22:44.360]  they basically don't want you to to look at it they don't want you to check it out
[2:22:44.360 --> 2:22:48.600]  and they'll come up with excuses for why you shouldn't look at the definitive database
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:54.040]  that's used by the cdc and the fda for stuff for spawning safety signals but it's all there
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:58.600]  it's all laid out the analysis is all done for you on my substack and you can also read the
[2:22:58.600 --> 2:23:05.720]  comments there and you'll see that the commenters aren't disputing um anything uh that i've written
[2:23:05.720 --> 2:23:10.680]  so i think uh that's important to to check this all this stuff out for yourself so there's another
[2:23:10.680 --> 2:23:15.240]  thing that i posted today another article that i posted today on something that came out on
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:25.560]  erin series um substack which was uh a woman uh debora conrad she's a medical um health care
[2:23:25.560 --> 2:23:33.880]  worker uh at a hospital and she wanted her hospital to track the number of patients who were admitted
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:40.200]  whether they were vaccinated or unvaccinated just on admissions not on covid uh tests at all
[2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:45.000]  and just on have you been vaccinated or haven't you been vaccinated not have you been vaccinated
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:50.040]  two years two weeks ago but just have you been vaccinated or not been vaccinated and what they
[2:23:50.040 --> 2:23:58.200]  found was 90 percent of the hospital admissions were from people who had been vaccinated in an area
[2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:05.400]  where it's less than 50 vaccination rate now the only possible way that that can happen
[2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:10.280]  mathematically you know there's there's no way around this it's it's mathematical certainty
[2:24:10.280 --> 2:24:16.280]  that that means that people who have been vaccinated are nine times more likely to be
[2:24:16.280 --> 2:24:23.240]  hospitalized for a reason than people who are unvaccinated and steve i want to stop because
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:27.640]  this is so huge we have plenty of time to get a news some next segment tell us the headlines we
[2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:32.440]  can find it again this is huge i didn't know this this is this is amazing information it's
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:36.440]  it's what we've seen anecdotally and seen out of the british medical journal and we know
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:41.800]  that there's this is going on but these numbers are just over the top tell us where we find this
[2:24:42.680 --> 2:24:48.120]  um it's on my sub stack right now it's the most recent article that i published on my sub stack
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:53.640]  so everyone missed this one vaccinated people are up to nine x more likely to be hospitalized
[2:24:53.640 --> 2:24:59.640]  than unvaccinated people wow please continue yeah and you know i kind of missed it too when i read
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:05.480]  it i said wow this just shows that what they're saying is not true about because they're they're
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:10.440]  focused on a vaccinated person is being vaccinated only two weeks after they've had their vaccine
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:16.360]  well that's when all the injuries happen so if you actually just look at hospital admissions
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:22.600]  which this hospital did because most hospitals don't track these numbers that's the thing most
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:28.760]  hospitals don't track the numbers so so deborah was able to get her hospital to actually track the
[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:36.440]  numbers and they found out that 90 percent of the admissions were vaccinated and so the only
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:43.160]  mathematically possible way to explain this is that if you get the vaccine you're going to be
[2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:48.760]  nine times more likely to be hospitalized after getting the vaccine you know for some period of
[2:25:48.760 --> 2:25:55.240]  time um then then someone who's not and that period of time isn't just weeks after you got the vaccine
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:26:00.920]  wow i'm i'm looking at your article now and you've got uh links to the articles the hospital all of
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:06.600]  it and is that what we're also seeing even an mpr and associated press uh in australia and the us
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:11.320]  and canada and europe they're like the hospitals are at record capacity but this time it's true it's
[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:15.080]  not like last year when they were lying and then you check the hospital so yeah they don't have
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:21.160]  covid but it's covid like and they're having heart attacks and blood clots and and and ade type
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:26.440]  stuff uh yeah there's an example right there so so that really right there proves something massive
[2:26:26.440 --> 2:26:30.760]  is going on and like you said they're trying to spend it and say oh it must be marijuana well
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:34.840]  everybody's been smoking the same amount of marijuana for a while or five g's been going in
[2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:42.520]  for a while uh so yeah clearly they're trying to distract off onto that yeah exactly exactly it's
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:47.560]  all a distraction you know it's like how they distract people for getting the covid vaccines
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:53.640]  the distraction is well it will reduce your death rate by 90 percent if you get covid that was the
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:27:00.200]  original promise we found out that's not quite true in fact the physers own six month study showed
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:07.160]  it could only reduce it your chance of death by 50 percent and it would only save one life in 22
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:13.720]  thousand and which means when you inject 20 220 million people you're only going to save 10,000
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:20.600]  lives that's a drop in the bucket so you know in terms of the effectiveness but you see they're
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:24.920]  not pointing out that hey there's this other people there are other people who actually
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:29.960]  died from all-cause mortality from different things like cardiac arrest and they didn't
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:35.240]  point this out in the abstract this this hand you know it's like a magician pay attention to the 90
[2:27:35.240 --> 2:27:42.040]  percent who you know who the risk reduction was only 50 percent in terms of the uh uh mortality
[2:27:42.040 --> 2:27:48.360]  benefit but they didn't show that that other hand in the abstract it never mentioned that 20 people
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:55.960]  who got the vaccine died compared to 14 people who got the placebo so incredible and six people
[2:27:57.080 --> 2:28:01.320]  what about the issue as well that there i mean there's just so much to get into it
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:06.280]  it makes my head spin how long do you think they can continue to suppress this information
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:15.080]  um that's a really good question that's a really good question i don't know the answers to that
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:20.680]  i think you know people get this gradually and they start to wake up they see their friends
[2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:27.000]  who are vaccine injured they get a booster shot and they're paralyzed and so it happens and people
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:32.200]  then start to believe it more and more as they see reality as they see their friends it's once
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:36.760]  they see their friends affected by this this is what changes people or when they get a shot the
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:42.120]  reason that 20 percent of the people don't come back for their second shot you know 15 to 20 percent
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:46.760]  don't come back for their second shot is because they had a bad reaction to their first shot it's
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:50.600]  not because they don't know how to schedule the second shot and by the way bill gates admitted
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:54.200]  that before they were rolled the shot out he said 80 percent and their trials were getting the sick
[2:28:54.200 --> 2:28:59.320]  we'll be right back if you're concerned about them so when i first started taking survival skill
[2:28:59.320 --> 2:29:04.920]  basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:09.640]  holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:14.440]  was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:18.200]  you came out with x2 you had you know with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited
[2:29:18.200 --> 2:29:24.600]  about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:29.960]  was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course
[2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:34.680]  of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your
[2:29:34.680 --> 2:29:39.640]  supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it
[2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:43.960]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point
[2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:48.680]  is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to
[2:29:48.680 --> 2:29:53.800]  do that is to take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much

[2:31:57.080 --> 2:32:02.520]  if you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are
[2:32:02.520 --> 2:32:07.800]  trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upper mobility you've got to divide and conquer
[2:32:07.800 --> 2:32:13.000]  the public so they don't know they're being targeted that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:18.600]  themselves the name of lb gt and african-american rights all the rest of it all over the world
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:23.880]  that's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in africa and in communist china and
[2:32:23.880 --> 2:32:28.680]  many other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big
[2:32:28.680 --> 2:32:34.280]  tech of the central banks and other zone so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new
[2:32:34.280 --> 2:32:41.560]  superclass it's the politicians it's the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:45.960]  members of congress and their staff and their families it's the white house hell it's postal
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:52.520]  workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general public and everybody else
[2:32:52.520 --> 2:32:56.040]  through corporate rule so this is the true discrimination that's going on
[2:32:56.040 --> 2:33:02.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:12.840]  so
[2:33:12.840 --> 2:33:23.240]  so
[2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:35.240]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:39.640]  so
[2:33:39.640 --> 2:33:42.360]  since steve kersh was on with us a little over a week ago
[2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:49.720]  we have seen both bill gates and fauci both deeply in bed together uh well on their medical
[2:33:49.720 --> 2:33:57.000]  tourney rollout admit that oh this so-called vaccine really isn't a vaccine it doesn't
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:03.400]  stop you getting sick or transmission wow that's that's pretty amazing it's like buying a boat and
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:06.920]  they go by the way it's got 20 holes in it after you buy it oh this boat's great it works wonderful
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:12.040]  when you put the water it sinks that's called fraud and so they both come out and say but don't
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:17.640]  worry you need boosters that'll fix you but they're admitting though that the more you take the
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:21.640]  shots the more it wanes and the more you don't have an immune system so we'll talk about that
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:26.680]  in a moment but here's these incredible admissions that i've been censored for and medical doctors
[2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:32.360]  have been censored for and people have been persecuted for when this was known pretty much
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:38.040]  instantly in britain when they rolled this stuff out so here is uh here here are the two perpetrators
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:46.840]  admitting it economic damage the you know the deaths it's been completely horrific and i would
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:55.720]  expect that will lead the r&d budgets to be focused on things we didn't have today you know we didn't
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:35:01.080]  have vaccines that block transmission we got vaccines that help you with your health but
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:06.120]  they only slightly reduce the transmissions we need a new a new way of doing the vaccine
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:12.760]  point number three we are seeing something that is really interesting and i'd like to
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:19.400]  get a little bit more unpacking of it with you in in a bit and that is we're starting to see
[2:35:20.760 --> 2:35:29.720]  waning immunity against infection and waning immunity in the beginning aspect against hospitalization
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:37.720]  and if you look at israel which has always been a month to a month and a half ahead of us
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:44.840]  in the dynamics of the outbreak in their vaccine response and in every other element of the
[2:35:44.840 --> 2:35:54.280]  outbreak they are seeing a waning of immunity not only against infection but against hospitalizations
[2:35:54.280 --> 2:36:01.960]  and to some extent death which is starting to now involve all age groups it isn't just the elderly
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:11.800]  so if one looks back at this one can say do you know it isn't as if a booster is a bonus
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:19.080]  but a booster might actually be an essential part of the primary regimen that people should have
[2:36:19.080 --> 2:36:24.760]  so he's following an exact script we're just six months behind australia and the uk and on this
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:28.760]  now it's going to be you've got to take the booster so they don't get in trouble for all the
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:33.240]  fraud or their product not working now you just got to take more i've never heard of a product
[2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:38.440]  where our product doesn't work so the answer is more but in the study show that makes it worse
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:43.160]  give us the facts here steve kirch well yeah i mean they're doubling down on something that
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:48.120]  doesn't work um you know insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:55.800]  a different result maybe i should just leave no no i totally agree yeah and so you know that
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:02.440]  there are now three studies that have shown that the pcr results for the vaccinated and the unvaccinated
[2:37:02.440 --> 2:37:07.560]  are the same so if you look at these they're almost like rorschach tests or there are little
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:13.480]  plots of where people fall on the pcr uh for vaccinated and unvaccinated and you know what
[2:37:13.480 --> 2:37:20.280]  but you'll never you'll never believe it the the charts are exactly the same you can't tell
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:25.880]  the difference now what's really interesting is the biostatistician say well that's because
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:31.080]  of this well that's because of this it's really working but that's because of this but you know
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.440]  the thing is that if you have a hypothesis that says that the vaccines don't work at all
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:46.840]  those charts would be exactly what you'd expect to see they can form to the hypothesis 100 percent
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:53.000]  you don't have to make any excuses the hypothesis that says the vaccines are effective the data
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:38:01.400]  just aligns with that hypothesis 100 no questions asked three separate studies show the same thing
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:08.200]  show the same thing so so we have a vaccine which doesn't work and which is harmful so what do we do
[2:38:08.200 --> 2:38:15.160]  we keep telling people you the problem is that you need more of it it's it's the most insane thing
[2:38:15.160 --> 2:38:21.240]  and people are lapping it up like like I mean they're believing everything that they hear
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:26.600]  they're totally believing that it didn't work on the first two so it's going to work on the third
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:33.880]  one there is no evidence folks I mean sorry the emperor has no clothes here there is no evidence
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:42.520]  look what happened in Israel after the third booster rates went through the roof I mean this is we
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:47.800]  are great I mean how do you look at the data on this because I'm not as technical as you I just
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:53.320]  read all these articles and studies where people six months after the Pfizer shot especially to
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:58.360]  take the booster they then get negative immunity meaning before the shot they had better immunity
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:01.880]  than after they had it six months later that doesn't sound like a very good product to me
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:09.480]  yeah if you look on the expose website they have some graphs they did some really nice graphs
[2:39:09.480 --> 2:39:15.080]  showing vaccine efficacy waning so you get the vaccine it appears to work for just a little
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:19.560]  while and then it goes down to zero and then it goes negative which means you're more likely to be
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:25.880]  infected if you get the vaccine now this sounds like heroin dealers or something where do we find
[2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:33.800]  those graphs sir oh on I'm gonna have to post it on my my substack so so I'll do that uh just to
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:40.920]  make it easy for people I'll post it after this interview I mean I love to be able to show people
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:46.520]  just that all in one place yeah um yeah happy to hold over the next segment because by then we'll
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:49.880]  have it up there let's start getting into Newsom you've written a big article about that saying
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:56.280]  Newsom's lying about his vaccine injury and here you can prove it yeah so look I've got 17 different
[2:39:56.280 --> 2:40:02.760]  sources um there's 17 different pieces of evidence and they're all consistent with the hypothesis
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:12.360]  that Gavin Newsom is vaccine injured 17 different pieces of evidence from uh about uh over 10
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:19.640]  different sources independent sources and so I'm now at the stage where I'm willing to risk some money
[2:40:20.280 --> 2:40:27.480]  to prove a point so I'm willing to I'm now willing to risk as of yesterday um I just put out an offer
[2:40:27.480 --> 2:40:33.080]  to say Gavin I'm willing to bet you a million dollars that you're a liar so I'm risking a million
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:39.240]  dollars you don't have to believe me at all in my analysis in what the evidence showed all you have
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:43.960]  to believe is that there's some millionaire who is willing to risk a million dollars that he's
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:50.680]  right so he probably thinks he's right and I can guarantee you Gavin Newsom is not going to take my
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:57.640]  bet no way I'm offering him million dollars all he has to do is give me a piece of paper that lists
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:41:05.800]  all the doctors that he talked to since um for the purposes of discussing vaccine injury from the
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:11.880]  time that he got vaccinated to 21 days later I don't want to know anything else that's it just
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:18.520]  the list of doctors and on that piece of paper is the permission that he grants to those doctors
[2:41:18.520 --> 2:41:24.840]  and he orders those doctors to discuss with me any conversations relating to vaccine injury
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:31.640]  now if Gavin Newsom is telling the truth he'll give me a blank sheet of paper
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:38.840]  and I will give him a check for a million dollars now to me that's a deal that most people
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:46.040]  shouldn't refuse he's revealing nothing about any of his personal medical information the
[2:41:46.040 --> 2:41:52.520]  piece of paper is blank and he gets a check for a million dollars and you've got you're a well-known
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:59.000]  you know uh the tech guy you've got plenty of money so what's stopping him well what's stopping
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:05.320]  is him is he's not telling the truth and that's why he won't accept my bet because when he if he's
[2:42:05.320 --> 2:42:10.840]  telling the truth he's going to hand me a piece of paper that is not blank and if the piece of
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:17.800]  paper isn't blank you know immediately that he lied to people look he didn't he he got vaccinated
[2:42:17.800 --> 2:42:22.520]  because he actually thought you know a lot of people think that these politicians get sailing
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:30.840]  shots Gavin Newsom got the real thing he actually believes that the vaccines are helpful now he
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:36.440]  knows they're not because he could see it himself and I noticed you pointed out his children are
[2:42:36.440 --> 2:42:40.360]  I remember seeing articles admitting his children weren't let's come back and talk about that and
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:44.680]  show some of the photos and videos and then uh our our guests will give us some final comments

[2:46:55.320 --> 2:47:11.240]  your bottle today you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:25.160]  you
[2:47:25.160 --> 2:47:53.680]  Let's play a clip from Pfizer CEO Bola, ought to be Ebola, saying we need to criminalize
[2:47:53.680 --> 2:47:59.800]  people questioning us in disinfo and there's dark forces out there, you know, that need
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:04.760]  to be dealt with when we know the science and the facts.
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:09.600]  They put a drug on the market, not even a vaccine, that wears off in a few months and
[2:48:09.600 --> 2:48:14.000]  then you have lower immunity after what that I mean that sounds horrible sounds like oxy
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:19.320]  cotton or something and and now here he is last week on the Atlantic Council getting
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:23.200]  getting really desperate here it is.
[2:48:23.200 --> 2:48:28.560]  There was some fake news during this period of time about the vaccines you know all sorts
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:33.600]  of conspiracy theories how did you deal with that and how did you navigate that and where
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:38.800]  do you feel the primary source of this sort of fake news was how damaging was this to
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:39.800]  us.
[2:48:39.800 --> 2:48:46.880]  I'm afraid it was quite a lot damaging and there was particular with us we were targeted
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:55.000]  by a lot of let's say dark organizations that you don't really know the ownership you suspect
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:01.840]  that there are some countries behind we were getting a lot of briefings from CIA from FBI
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:10.000]  about attacks that may happen to us cyber attacks I mean but also about the spread of misinformation.
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:15.920]  You know there is there are two groups of people right there are the people that they
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:20.120]  are vaccinated there are people that are skeptical about the vaccination and both of them are
[2:49:20.120 --> 2:49:27.120]  afraid those that are getting the vaccine they are afraid of the disease and they believe
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:31.800]  that because people are not getting vaccinated they are increasing their risk to them they
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:36.880]  are increasing the exposure so they are let's say mad with them that they don't get the
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:41.960]  vaccine those that they don't get the vaccine they're afraid of the vaccine and they are
[2:49:41.960 --> 2:49:49.240]  mad with the people that are pressing them to get it and there is those I understand
[2:49:49.240 --> 2:49:56.160]  they are very good people they are decent people that they had a fear and they understand
[2:49:56.160 --> 2:50:03.560]  it and they don't want to take chances but there is a very small part of professionals
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:10.920]  which they circulate on purpose misinformation so that they will mislead those that they
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:16.240]  have conserved those people are criminals they are not bad people they are criminals
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:20.400]  because they literally cost millions of lives.
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:24.720]  And then should be treated as criminals as well those who have done that?
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:33.840]  No treated as criminals as well says Mr. Atlantic so they lied to us all along we have the facts
[2:50:33.840 --> 2:50:37.680]  the wheels are coming off and now in the UK they are trying to pass a lot of arrest people
[2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:42.640]  that question the shots so I think they are far from giving up here what do you think
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:43.640]  Steve?
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:47.960]  Well you know it is interesting because I don't fall into either camp that he talked
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:54.720]  about because I actually got the vaccine because I believed what they were telling me and it
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:51:01.520]  wasn't until a month after I got my second shot that I found that my friends were either
[2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:07.000]  dead some of my friends were dead or they were permanently disabled.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:16.480]  So I am not in either camp I got the vaccine but now the evidence is clear I wrote an article
[2:51:16.480 --> 2:51:23.720]  on my sub-stack unassailable proof that the CDC that the COVID vaccines are the most deadly
[2:51:23.720 --> 2:51:27.600]  vaccines in human history unassailable proof.
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:32.440]  And so what I do is I go through the VAERS data and I say hey look you don't have to
[2:51:32.440 --> 2:51:37.160]  believe me about the under-reporting factor 41 if we just have an under-reporting factor
[2:51:37.160 --> 2:51:43.880]  which nobody would disagree with it is still the most dangerous vaccine it is the most
[2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:57.240]  deadly vaccine in human history even if you have the most ludicrous assumptions on the
[2:51:57.240 --> 2:51:58.240]  parameters.
[2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:04.080]  So it goes from really bad in the worst ever more deadly than smallpox well I'll start
[2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:12.000]  over I mean we say that yeah it's even if you took like people say only the under-reporting
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:18.240]  factor of errors it's not 41 it's got to be less than that and I say fine take one use
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:24.120]  one nobody disagrees with that that one is super conservative even if you have the most
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:33.720]  super conservative assumption of one then it's still 36 times more deadly than smallpox
[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:40.360]  which is a vaccine that Paul Offit has said is unacceptably has unacceptably high death
[2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:43.720]  risk that it would never be used in the United States.
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:49.400]  So this is at least 36 times worse and if you believe the facts it's over 800 times
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:55.480]  more deadly than the deadliest vaccine in human history so that was and that was just
[2:52:55.480 --> 2:53:03.240]  one point the other point that I raised is I have a neurologist who wants to remain anonymous
[2:53:03.240 --> 2:53:08.720]  for right now because she's afraid that if her identity was revealed that she would get
[2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:12.640]  her license revoked and they would come after her for revealing the truth but the truth
[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:20.760]  is she has 20,000 patients 2,000 of them are vaccine injured 2,000 and so I said well
[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:24.440]  you've been in practice she's been in practice for 11 years I said well so how does this
[2:53:24.440 --> 2:53:30.000]  compare with the other 11 years you've been in practice you've got all sorts of vaccines
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:39.920]  people have taken over 11 years zero cases zero and now she's got 2,000 cases she had
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:46.480]  zero over 11 years and now it's 2,000 so you can't say that this is over reporting in
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:55.720]  fairs you know like I've got another doctor 29 years in practice he's only has 75 750
[2:53:55.720 --> 2:54:09.080]  patients or so but he he now has 20 like he's got over 25 reports in terms of adverse reactions
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:14.880]  zero in 29 years now 25 reports and Steve as you know there's a lot of doctors and a
[2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:20.160]  lot of doctors that own biopsy labs for cancer and and they're saying they're seeing massive
[2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:24.360]  increases in all these different types of cancer and the D dimer test massive increases
[2:54:24.360 --> 2:54:28.320]  in blood clots and the hospitals are full of all these vaccinated people the UK goes
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:33.840]  well double vax don't have super colds they're dying I mean there's no way they're gonna
[2:54:33.840 --> 2:54:38.640]  be able to cover this up you know there's there's a paper and I'll post it to my sub
[2:54:38.640 --> 2:54:50.200]  stack and that the the vaccine damages the the DNA and the DNA damage is to areas which
[2:54:50.200 --> 2:54:58.320]  would suppress cancer and so this is why we're seeing some people reporting like a 10 times
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:06.240]  uptick in cancer and also cancers that were under control before they got the vaccine
[2:55:06.240 --> 2:55:12.480]  are now out of control and we're seeing this with with shingles especially people who've
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:16.880]  had shingles you're seeing shingles outbreaks come back and they're coming back with a vengeance
[2:55:16.880 --> 2:55:21.000]  all right Steve Kirsch we got to get you back on amazing job God bless you Steve Kirsch

[3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:09.600]  groups were attacking us and demonizing us and claiming that we had a covid cure we
[3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:14.760]  were never saying that we did not say that and it wasn't true but they wouldn't stop
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:20.920]  saying it and so we pulled our best-selling toothpaste that had been sold long before
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:25.800]  the whole covid hysteria began that was whitening toothpaste that had some colloidal silver in
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:30.040]  it that my dad had designed it was very very popular it was amazing but they wouldn't stop
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:34.680]  saying that i was selling it as some type of covid cure so we pulled it off the market
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:42.120]  now over a year later we have the same toothpaste but without the silver and it's even better
[3:01:42.120 --> 3:01:47.400]  ladies and gentlemen it's more concentrated it's even a better formula so super silver is now

[3:07:24.040 --> 3:07:30.280]  outside politics is for whatever then you know what then you better not complain because our entire
[3:07:30.280 --> 3:07:36.040]  lives right now everybody every american their lives are wrapped around politics right now
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:39.720]  if you don't think that something's changing you don't feel the way i feel right now you don't
[3:07:39.720 --> 3:07:44.440]  feel the way these five thousand people out here feel then something's wrong what we're really
[3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:51.000]  facing is an attack or an assault on all of our basic rights i mean i think the the real issue
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:58.360]  here in play is the attack on freedom of speech you have this incredibly failed foreign policy
[3:07:58.360 --> 3:08:04.040]  by the biden administration you have you know more and more very clear evidence coming out about
[3:08:04.040 --> 3:08:08.680]  covid and the and really the conspiracy behind covid and some of the things that are happening
[3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:14.600]  with it i applaud you for it was one of your interviews 10 years ago probably 10 years ago
[3:08:14.600 --> 3:08:19.560]  may have been more than 10 years ago now where you actually were talking about these issues and you
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:25.000]  can't you covered it for quite a while actually at that time and i think that you got a lot of
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:30.280]  bashing by you know the by others in the media and by others around the world because it was like
[3:08:30.280 --> 3:08:36.840]  oh this guy alexander and lo and behold here we are a decade later and they have implemented
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:42.200]  this strategy this great reset strategy the globalists have said in their white papers in their own
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:48.680]  un documents that they want to create race specific bio weapons and other systems to depopulate the
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:54.280]  planet a lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release bio weapons claim that
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:09:01.480]  they're naturally occurring and then use that as the cover for civil emergency societal control
[3:09:01.480 --> 3:09:06.600]  crackdowns on free speech obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago and when he got
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:12.520]  confronted by it by congress he said well it's in case the bird flu or sars gets out just type that in
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:19.480]  cdc says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or sars breaks out and they have to control panic
[3:09:19.480 --> 3:09:24.840]  and direct every website in the us to one government announcement and we looked at every angle and
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:30.200]  believe a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government
[3:09:30.200 --> 3:09:35.320]  to counter a global problem and the un has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:51.000]  may save their world government don't let the globalists take info wars out of the game they're
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:55.080]  fighting hard to do it they're fighting hard to arrest and demonize everybody the man sitting next
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:10:03.320]  to me facing multiple years in prison for peacefully being at the us capital with me on january 6 and
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:07.880]  i talked to his lawyer he's a famous criminal lawyer yesterday about oan he didn't know this but
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:11.880]  he's joining us the bottom of the hour his lawyer because oan really can't talk about it but his
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:17.080]  lawyer can they put a filing in showing that oan was with us with security that we tried to stop the
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:23.480]  riot and the fbi put in there that that's not true and that we were attacking the building
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:28.360]  basically that oan wasn't even with us and that the police told us to go away none of that's even
[3:10:28.360 --> 3:10:34.520]  true they're putting federal filings in with videos linked as evidence that show the opposite of what
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:42.120]  they say this has reached cuckoo level insane nobody's ever seen government act like this
[3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:47.880]  so people ask how are you handling it jones default judgment is trying to shut you down
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:53.720]  all this stuff i'm lucky i'm not indicted like roger stone or steve vannon or oan schroyer
[3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:59.160]  because let me tell you something folks when they go after you in dc it's rigged
[3:11:00.760 --> 3:11:06.280]  at least it's been in the past uh so this is very dangerous times and it's not about us
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:12.360]  it's about all of us america is under attack and we've had it so good and so easy so long
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.640]  that we got to ask ourselves are we even half as good as our grandparents or great grandparents
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:25.160]  when i get the boomers have been just as bad as us in a lot of ways but you know i'm i'm a gen
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:29.560]  xer and i just i will not sit here and watch tyranny running around and just tear the country
[3:11:29.560 --> 3:11:36.200]  in a thousand pieces you saw that general flin clip that's just the intro of the hour long interview
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:41.640]  i did that is the stuff of victory believe me the people in the room is like 10 people in the room
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:45.960]  including some folks who work for me that i don't hire them to be yes men they were like
[3:11:45.960 --> 3:11:49.960]  that's the most powerful thing we've ever seen you do that that's that's that's the that's the deal
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:53.000]  so i don't hire a bunch of yes men around here that's not what i want people to get
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:58.600]  them with the early thing and folks told me okay that's that's that's that's the antidote to what's
[3:11:58.600 --> 3:12:02.840]  happening right now so in a blueprint for victory tomorrow it goes up at noon we're going to air it
[3:12:02.840 --> 3:12:08.280]  here tomorrow with general flin i got butterflies over what's coming up i mean you know tonight
[3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:13.240]  i'll be on the biggest podcaster in the world you know on somebody else's show that's great i'm
[3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:18.280]  excited about that but it doesn't he doesn't one tenth as big as this because this you get to see
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:24.120]  a full plan that i know will work that is simpatico with what i understand and also know how dangerous
[3:12:24.120 --> 3:12:28.360]  it is i mean you you want to see some flipping out wait till this interview goes out but that's
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:34.680]  where i want to be you see i want to be in the game i i love the john paul jones quote the founder of
[3:12:34.680 --> 3:12:41.560]  the navy uh you know 240 something years ago where he said i only want the fastest ships to go directly
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:47.240]  into action in his commission and he did it around the world he was also in the british navy in the
[3:12:47.240 --> 3:12:51.400]  russian navy and a bunch of other stuff he died in the russian navy but he wanted to fight he said
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:56.600]  i want to go in on the fastest ships only into harm's way only into combat well i'm not looking for
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:13:02.280]  physical combat but i want to be hitting the hard subjects i want to be having the enemy on my tail
[3:13:02.280 --> 3:13:07.640]  because that means i'm exposing them and i'm doing the right thing oh and shroyer so much to cover
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:14.120]  written house uh the loudam county bathroom rapist pleads guilty uh i mean it's all wow vindication
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:19.160]  upon vindication this is getting crazy well ultimately what you just said there alex is why
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:24.760]  info wars needs to still be on air because we do talk about the subjects nobody else will talk about
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:30.440]  most people that are on mainstream news even the fake lefties they talk about the same subjects we
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:34.840]  talk about in the same manner that we talk about them they may have a different ideology or a different
[3:13:34.840 --> 3:13:39.560]  approach to them but they talk about the same stuff they know all this is going on they may say hey
[3:13:39.560 --> 3:13:44.040]  it's good america's falling or hey humanity needs to be depopulated that may be their approach to
[3:13:44.040 --> 3:13:49.160]  these subjects but we actually talk about them we don't hide or approach these things with kid
[3:13:49.160 --> 3:13:53.400]  gloves like you see on so many other media outlets that's why it's so key to keep info wars on air
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:58.600]  but honestly it's hard to even believe any of this is real alex i mean i i i you read the
[3:13:58.600 --> 3:14:02.280]  filing i know you want to you don't want to get into it your lawyer will but i mean it's a freaking
[3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:08.040]  lie end to end this is like let's say i mean you've got you've got your bank account statement
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:13.080]  and you're following your bank account statement and you notice that there's somebody making withdrawals
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:17.480]  and it's not you and it's just two hundred dollars three hundred dollars five hundred dollars a thousand
[3:14:17.480 --> 3:14:21.080]  dollars five thousand dollars fifteen thousand dollars you're like okay so you call the bank
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:25.640]  you're saying hey somebody's making withdrawals here they're not me these are fraudulent withdrawals
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:30.840]  and they just say no it's you those are your withdrawals that yep you just there's nothing
[3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:34.920]  you can do about it and you're just sitting in this moment it's like what how is this even real
[3:14:34.920 --> 3:14:39.480]  gave them are all the bank accounts in the civil cases even though no one has ever done that
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:44.680]  and the google analytics they said you've given us nothing and then they judge you sign orders lying
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:51.720]  i mean we're talking criminal it might be it's all criminal it's all criminal well what's amazing
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:56.440]  is that throughout history when you're living history most people don't realize that they're
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:02.280]  living history it's just they're day to day live whether it's a relaxing life or a hard life it's
[3:15:02.280 --> 3:15:05.720]  just that's that's them just experiencing consciousness i'm glad you said that i meant to
[3:15:05.720 --> 3:15:09.720]  leave the show with that i can't find the stack guys print me the article the fox news article
[3:15:09.720 --> 3:15:13.880]  about the chinese dissident was on bbs and they aren't you worried about trump and the fascism he
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:18.360]  goes no no we're you're under a communist takeover right now with biden you just don't know it that's
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:23.880]  how this works yeah the pbs host tries to set him up to bash trump and he says no trump's not the
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:30.600]  authoritarian it's it's it's other factors but we have to understand that we're in a historical
[3:15:30.600 --> 3:15:35.640]  moment right now in every decision and every action that gets made right now is going to be
[3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:41.320]  a turning point in history either for world freedom and world prosperity or world enslavement and
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:46.760]  global oppression i mean that's that's it every decision every move every game time this is this
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:51.320]  is the crossroads when the whole next future thing is said and the globalists know that i want
[3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:57.320]  freuders stay right there we'll play that clip from china what if you could if you think the tyranny
[3:15:57.320 --> 3:16:02.600]  and oppression we're living under now is bad wait till they've got their world id and then that's
[3:16:02.600 --> 3:16:09.160]  exactly what the covid passports are all about and claus swab and then you in and all the other
[3:16:09.160 --> 3:16:15.160]  globalist leaders own words they admit that once they've gotten you with that system then they're
[3:16:15.160 --> 3:16:20.600]  gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're
[3:16:20.600 --> 3:16:26.200]  gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other
[3:16:26.200 --> 3:16:31.400]  big companies are currently announcing they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:37.400]  you with a carbon tax for it this is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen this is
[3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:42.200]  the takeover in humanity better wake up and say no finally folks are starting to wake up
[3:16:42.200 --> 3:16:46.520]  joe rogan tucker carls and others will leave the charts along with info wars but it's not enough
[3:16:46.520 --> 3:16:51.640]  every individual has to not comply we have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:55.080]  you see they need the fear of god put in them legally and lawfully
[3:16:57.640 --> 3:17:02.200]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:29.080]  you
[3:17:32.200 --> 3:17:41.660]  InfoWorst.com is simply the best InfoWorst.com beats out all the rest
[3:17:41.660 --> 3:17:55.660]  Triple H, 253, 3139, Triple H, 253, 3139, Triple H, 253, 3139 is the InfoWorst.com
[3:17:55.660 --> 3:18:01.200]  InfoWorst Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[3:18:01.200 --> 3:18:06.200]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:13.200]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:18.200]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:18:18.200 --> 3:18:22.200]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:18:22.200 --> 3:18:26.200]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later,
[3:18:26.200 --> 3:18:33.200]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:38.200]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:43.200]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[3:18:43.200 --> 3:18:48.200]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:50.200]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:56.200]  Head to InfoWorstLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:24.200]  If you want to throw a quick plug out for the fun of the product, the X2Cube does wonders.
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:27.200]  They recommend it to everybody. You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence.
[3:19:27.200 --> 3:19:29.200]  Get the product. Support the InfoWorst.
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:32.200]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead.
[3:19:32.200 --> 3:19:34.200]  Hey Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[3:19:34.200 --> 3:19:35.200]  Honor, talk to you.
[3:19:35.200 --> 3:19:36.200]  Awesome.
[3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:42.200]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product. Alpha Power, even at 29.
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:46.200]  If you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:48.200]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:50.200]  It really works. It's not a joke.
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:51.200]  Absolutely.
[3:19:58.200 --> 3:20:01.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:12.200 --> 3:20:15.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show fourth hour.
[3:20:15.200 --> 3:20:20.200]  And in 40 minutes, oh, and Shroyer will take over for three hours with the war room,
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:25.200]  3 to 6 p.m. And then tonight, 7 o'clock central,
[3:20:25.200 --> 3:20:31.200]  we'll post the little surprise up at infowars.com.
[3:20:31.200 --> 3:20:32.200]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:38.200]  I mean, there'll be a podcaster as the initials J and R with Tim Poole and myself.
[3:20:38.200 --> 3:20:43.200]  So, look for that this evening, 7 o'clock central time.
[3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:45.200]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:49.200]  Oh, and you brought up the key point that I meant to start the whole show with.
[3:20:49.200 --> 3:20:54.200]  That this morning when I saw this, I meant to make it the top show headline today.
[3:20:54.200 --> 3:20:55.200]  But instead, I did.
[3:20:55.200 --> 3:20:57.200]  In fact, can you guys pull up the top show headline?
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:20:58.200]  I forget what we named the show today.
[3:20:58.200 --> 3:21:01.200]  That was in a hurry and a bunch of stuff was going on.
[3:21:01.200 --> 3:21:05.200]  That people need to recognize when you're already living in a dictatorship.
[3:21:05.200 --> 3:21:06.200]  There it is.
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:10.200]  Globalist Accelerate Plan for Worldwide Corporate Fascism while China Threatens War.
[3:21:10.200 --> 3:21:13.200]  Okay, we covered that. That's kind of the big thing right now, I think.
[3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:15.200]  But really what you said is the key.
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:16.200]  How do you encapsulate that?
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:18.200]  Like, history's happening now.
[3:21:18.200 --> 3:21:20.200]  This is a globalist attack now.
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:22.200]  That's what General Flynn's interviews about tomorrow is.
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:23.200]  Recognize this is history.
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:24.200]  This is it, folks.
[3:21:24.200 --> 3:21:27.200]  And if we don't identify who the enemies are, we have no hope of winning.
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:29.200]  If we identify them, they're easy to beat.
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:30.200]  Owen.
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:38.200]  If you study history, there's always key points, timelines, dates, events that end up being the threads of history.
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:41.200]  They end up being the course of human history.
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:47.200]  And you can take an example of what way is humanity going to go on planet Earth?
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:50.200]  Is it going to go the way of human freedom and free speech?
[3:21:50.200 --> 3:21:56.200]  Or is it going to go the way of bigger government, global government and oppression and everything else that comes with it?
[3:21:56.200 --> 3:22:04.200]  And you take each event and you understand that each event has a little in the pot about which way humanity is going to go.
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:15.200]  So take, take info wars. If the corrupt establishment can remove info wars, take Alex Jones voice, take Owen Schreuer's voice, take your voice.
[3:22:15.200 --> 3:22:20.200]  If they can do that, that will be a major turning point in history that will go down in history books.
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:23.200]  And it'll say that was a huge victory for the regime.
[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:26.200]  That was a huge victory for the evil globalist.
[3:22:26.200 --> 3:22:28.200]  And look, your co-host got indicted.
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:29.200]  You've been indicted.
[3:22:29.200 --> 3:22:30.200]  They're trying to get me.
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:32.200]  They're doing default judgments.
[3:22:32.200 --> 3:22:33.200]  I mean, we're over the target.
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:37.200]  Well, and it's, it's hard for a lot of people to comprehend this that are on the outside looking in.
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:39.200]  That's, that's not a knock on people.
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:40.200]  That's just natural.
[3:22:40.200 --> 3:22:45.200]  That's just how humanity is when you're in your own consciousness and you're experiencing things.
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:49.200]  It's hard to really fully relate or understand the complexities of these issues.
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:57.200]  But it's like there's, it's not a coincidence that you've seen what they've done to Donald Trump and Roger Stone and Steve Bannon and Alex Jones and Owen Schreuer and so many others.
[3:22:57.200 --> 3:22:58.200]  That's not a coincidence.
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:00.200]  This is by design.
[3:23:00.200 --> 3:23:09.200]  This is, this is a corporate world fascistic government that is going after it's what it views as its biggest obstacles and conquering the world.
[3:23:09.200 --> 3:23:17.200]  There's a reason why free speech is number one on the amendments list because it's ideas that can change the world.
[3:23:17.200 --> 3:23:20.200]  And that's the reason it's the main thing under attack by these people.
[3:23:20.200 --> 3:23:25.200]  And so they understand that this will be a big, this will be a big key marking victory for them.
[3:23:25.200 --> 3:23:35.200]  If, if they can successfully defeat free speech, whether it's Alex Jones or Andrew Breitbart or anybody else out there or Gateway Pundit or all the other great, great people.
[3:23:35.200 --> 3:23:44.200]  If they can eliminate free speech and set that precedent like they did with you years ago on social media, then they can move the ball forward.
[3:23:44.200 --> 3:23:46.200]  Then they can censor more people.
[3:23:46.200 --> 3:23:47.200]  Then they can move the ball forward.
[3:23:47.200 --> 3:23:49.200]  Then they can have other reasons to censor.
[3:23:49.200 --> 3:24:03.200]  That's the precedent. In fact, it's funny you say that I've got a stack of news, we'll play it next segment with your lawyer, Norm Patis, where the Democrats are licking their lips saying we're going to have the Alex Jones rule to take all the populist offline with judges where they just default you and you never get a trial.
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:07.200]  I mean, this is the end of juries, folks, the guilty until proven guilty.
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:14.200]  You have Jennifer Rubin going on MSNBC saying that time for Republicans and Trump supporters just not even be treated like people.
[3:24:14.200 --> 3:24:20.200]  I mean, that's literally what they said about the Jews before in the late 1930s.
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:22.200]  But George Soros is a liberal.
[3:24:22.200 --> 3:24:23.200]  He'll never let that happen.
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:25.200]  Oh, he was a Nazi collaborator.
[3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:32.200]  So imagine that the left is now saying that conservatives, Republicans, Trump voters shouldn't even be treated as people.
[3:24:32.200 --> 3:24:33.200]  So what are they going to say next?
[3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:34.200]  You don't have any rights?
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:39.200]  I mean, so that's what I'm saying is each, each little moment, each little event on a timeline.
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:44.200]  Well, Fauci already came out and said, you don't have individual rights, a few weeks ago, he said, you need to get over your rights.
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:45.200]  Now he says, you don't have them.
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:46.200]  I've got a video right here.
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:47.200]  Screw your freedom.
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:48.200]  And think about it.
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  That doesn't even rate playing now him coming out and saying, A, the vaccine doesn't work and B, you don't have any personal bodily freedom.
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:24:57.200]  He says, you don't have personal freedom.
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:24:58.200]  And it's not.
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:24:59.200]  It's clip number one.
[3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:00.200]  Barely even news.
[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:01.200]  You know what?
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:02.200]  Let's play clip number one since we mentioned this.
[3:25:02.200 --> 3:25:06.200]  Here's clip number one, a new Fauci declaration of war.
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:07.200]  Here's clip one.
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:20.200]  One of the things that to me was most difficult to accept is that we put together a good plan for how we were going to try and dampen down the spread of infection early on,
[3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:23.200]  thinking that that was accepted by everybody.
[3:25:23.200 --> 3:25:33.200]  And then the next day, the president saying, free Michigan, free Virginia, I didn't quite understand what the purpose of that was,
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:45.200]  except to put this misplaced perception about people's individual right to make a decision that supersedes the societal safety.
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:50.200]  That to me is one of the things that I think went awry in all of this.
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:53.200]  Did you ever raise that with President Trump?
[3:25:53.200 --> 3:25:56.200]  You know, I didn't have the opportunity to raise it.
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:25:57.200]  I was sort of like shocked.
[3:25:57.200 --> 3:26:00.200]  And then I didn't speak to him for some time after that.
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:09.200]  But it was at that point that I realized that I would have to just get out there myself.
[3:26:09.200 --> 3:26:10.200]  That's enough.
[3:26:10.200 --> 3:26:11.200]  I love Ted Koppel.
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:14.200]  He ran from the Nazis too and now brought it here just like George Soros.
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:16.200]  Thanks a lot, jerks.
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:19.200]  And then they tell us we're Nazis when they're the people recreating it.
[3:26:19.200 --> 3:26:22.200]  And it's just so frustrating.
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:23.200]  It doesn't work.
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:24.200]  It's a poison shot.
[3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:26.200]  It's all a fraud.
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:28.200]  It's killing people, you little maggots.
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:31.200]  And they'll never be able to cover that up no matter how many people they censor on.
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:38.200]  What's interesting is they're so bold now that they'll go on television and say,
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:42.200]  screw your freedom, or you don't have freedom, or you don't have the personal choice.
[3:26:42.200 --> 3:26:43.200]  I mean, they just come out and say it.
[3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:48.200]  So we've already crossed the threshold of them kind of poking and prodding and seeing what they can get away with.
[3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:50.200]  They now have an accepted...
[3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:53.200]  Yes, Schwarzenegger and Stern have both said, after your freedom.
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:54.200]  Those are quotes.
[3:26:54.200 --> 3:27:01.200]  So I mean, their strategy now is, okay, we've got Americans in this case in enough of a trance
[3:27:01.200 --> 3:27:04.200]  that we can literally just come out and say, you're not free anymore.
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:05.200]  You don't have rights.
[3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:06.200]  We're locking down your government.
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:10.200]  We're hitting you with an experimental vaccine and just shut up and take it.
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:13.200]  And I mean, it's barely even an uprising.
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:14.200]  I mean, I can show protests.
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:17.200]  There are protests happening nationwide in this country.
[3:27:17.200 --> 3:27:19.200]  Maybe 1,000 people there, 1,000 people here.
[3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:20.200]  And so that's good.
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:21.200]  People are rising up.
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:24.200]  But it shouldn't even, it should be tens of thousands.
[3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:25.200]  It should be hundreds of thousands.
[3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:26.200]  It should be millions.
[3:27:26.200 --> 3:27:33.200]  The fact that I'm still dealing with that maggot, that rat bastard, Anthony Fauci, is ridiculous.
[3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:35.200]  We should have been done with him in the 80s.
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:39.200]  Can you believe, yeah, when he suppressed good age drugs and gave people the ones that killed him.
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:41.200]  Can you believe they've now admitted that it doesn't work?
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:42.200]  So the answers take more.
[3:27:42.200 --> 3:27:44.200]  Even on the study show, it makes it worse.
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:46.200]  I mean, they're literally going to have more poison.
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:47.200]  Here it is.
[3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:54.200]  Well, we have to constantly, it's like, as the world gets crazier, how do we kind of reimagine
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:57.200]  what we're going to do on air to keep up with the craziness?
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:02.200]  I mean, it's almost to a point where I just want to put on a full blown clown outfit
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:04.200]  and just read the news like it's real.
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:07.200]  Like, you know, oh, Carl Rittenhouse, he has no right to self-defense.
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:10.200]  No, he, he, he acted wrong.
[3:28:10.200 --> 3:28:11.200]  And Alex Jones is guilty.
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:14.200]  He didn't get a jury trial, but a judge says he's guilty.
[3:28:14.200 --> 3:28:20.200]  Yeah, oh, and the, oh, and the, the Democrats, the Democrats are peaceful.
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:22.200]  It's the Republicans that are calling for riots.
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:24.200]  And pedophiles are good.
[3:28:24.200 --> 3:28:27.200]  Oh, so I mean, it's like, is that the level?
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:32.200]  I mean, do we have to go into full blown ironic humor to, to, to wake more people up now using comedy?
[3:28:32.200 --> 3:28:37.200]  Thing is, the average person's in a trance, but that doesn't mean the globalists just get to kill them.
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:40.200]  Joe, Joe Rogan took horse to warmer.
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:44.200]  Don't take the horse to warmer, folks.
[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:49.200]  It's the deadliest virus of all time, but don't take the horse to warmer.
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:28:50.200]  Stay there.
[3:28:50.200 --> 3:29:14.200]  We'll be right back with more.

[3:30:56.200 --> 3:31:00.200]  By now you've heard me talk about the BIOPROS and how they're creating amazing products.
[3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:06.200]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of BIO remediation products,
[3:31:06.200 --> 3:31:09.200]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer.
[3:31:09.200 --> 3:31:13.200]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:31:13.200 --> 3:31:18.200]  The BIOPROS are excited to release BIO Marine Pro,
[3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:24.200]  a product specifically designed to create healthy black and or gray water holding tanks.
[3:31:24.200 --> 3:31:29.200]  BIO Marine Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge, paper, and organic matter with ease.
[3:31:29.200 --> 3:31:33.200]  Get up to 20 treatments, coupled with an easy application scoop.

[3:31:42.200 --> 3:31:44.200]  It is also human and animal safe.
[3:31:44.200 --> 3:31:50.200]  Say goodbye to holding tank problems, gas buildup, and odor guarantee.
[3:31:50.200 --> 3:31:55.200]  Visit theBIOPROS.com and see for yourself.
[3:31:55.200 --> 3:32:00.200]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[3:32:00.200 --> 3:32:03.200]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:32:03.200 --> 3:32:08.200]  I was barely holding onto a jaw, and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[3:32:08.200 --> 3:32:11.200]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[3:32:11.200 --> 3:32:12.200]  And it worked pretty good.
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:16.200]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew, you know, with a deep burn source, you know,
[3:32:16.200 --> 3:32:18.200]  and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[3:32:18.200 --> 3:32:24.200]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[3:32:24.200 --> 3:32:28.200]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[3:32:28.200 --> 3:32:34.200]  Over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[3:32:34.200 --> 3:32:36.200]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:32:36.200 --> 3:32:38.200]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:40.200]  Literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:41.200]  It's amazing. It works.
[3:32:41.200 --> 3:32:44.200]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[3:32:44.200 --> 3:32:46.200]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[3:32:46.200 --> 3:32:50.200]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[3:32:50.200 --> 3:32:51.200]  Beautifully said, brother.
[3:32:51.200 --> 3:32:59.200]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:32:59.200 --> 3:33:07.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:07.200 --> 3:33:30.200]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:30.200 --> 3:33:33.200]  Well, I got to tell you, Owen, we are definitely in insane times.
[3:33:33.200 --> 3:33:38.200]  And Norm Pattis is a famous criminal lawyer, famous First Amendment lawyer and a lot more.
[3:33:38.200 --> 3:33:47.200]  And he represents you in your criminal case facing years in prison for peacefully being at the Capitol on January 6th with me.
[3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:50.200]  And there's a new filing that's just incredible.
[3:33:50.200 --> 3:33:56.200]  The total lies that you weren't with us and the police told you to go and then it's all on video.
[3:33:56.200 --> 3:33:58.200]  And then the videos, they let's show the opposite.
[3:33:58.200 --> 3:33:59.200]  I mean, it's next level.
[3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:05.200]  And I know I was talking to Norm last night about he was just like, yeah, he's represented murderers, you know, people.
[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:10.200]  He's a famous lawyer and that they get better shaped than us because this is show political, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:14.200]  We're not here to whine about Owen and trying to put him in prison.
[3:34:14.200 --> 3:34:17.200]  We're here to talk about a general.
[3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:21.200]  He also represents a bunch of people and there's successful cases so far.
[3:34:21.200 --> 3:34:28.200]  Some have been successful, some not trying to fight the unconstitutional vaccine mandate that we now see the fifth circuit saying this is wildly unconstitutional.
[3:34:28.200 --> 3:34:30.200]  What Biden has tried to do.
[3:34:30.200 --> 3:34:34.200]  So Norm Pattis is right in the middle of some of those national cases and this case.
[3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:38.200]  We also have him on with the default judgment in Connecticut.
[3:34:38.200 --> 3:34:44.200]  A lot of folks want me to talk about this, but I mean, I said four months ago they're going to default us in Texas and Connecticut.
[3:34:44.200 --> 3:34:49.200]  They can't let us get to trial with a jury and because what's being said is not true.
[3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:50.200]  And so I'm the bad guy.
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:52.200]  They're the good guys, even though that's not true.
[3:34:52.200 --> 3:34:56.200]  They've got lined up TV stations, HBO.
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:34:59.200]  So they're going to have literally it's going to be as big as the written house thing.
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:01.200]  And they've got like, there are four of them.
[3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:02.200]  There's a bunch of lawsuits.
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:08.200]  So they want to have trial after trial after trial after trial and just had it always on the news.
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:11.200]  And then people ask me, why won't you stop talking about Sandy Hook?
[3:35:11.200 --> 3:35:13.200]  I hardly ever talk about it. Hardly ever did talk about it.
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:19.200]  And because there wasn't evidence anywhere that we profited from Sandy Hook or had a marketing plan.
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:21.200]  I'm going to have a marketing plan about the news we cover.
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:23.200]  Then they just said, well, we don't believe that.
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:24.200]  So you're defaulted.
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:29.200]  I'm unprecedented. So I wanted to tackle that first with Norm and then talk about some of the January 6 stuff in general,
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:34.200]  because I have a lot of media tuned in, a lot of them calling me and I'm not a lawyer.
[3:35:34.200 --> 3:35:36.200]  So like, well, let me talk to your lawyer then.
[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:40.200]  I mean, you're really saying you did give them the bank records, which they shouldn't even have asked for.
[3:35:40.200 --> 3:35:42.200]  And you really did give them the Google Analytics.
[3:35:42.200 --> 3:35:46.200]  Yeah, I mean, yes, yes, even though they shouldn't be asking for that.
[3:35:46.200 --> 3:35:52.200]  It should be about what I said on air, but they had a theory that we schemed for hours before and go,
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:54.200]  oh, this will be a big lie to tell to make money.
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:35:56.200]  Ask the nine.
[3:35:56.200 --> 3:35:59.200]  So after all their depositions and all, well, we never deposed anybody in the Texas case.
[3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:01.200]  In fact, they're probably going to say we're not allowed to.
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:05.200]  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, you get deposed for years and hundreds of thousands of documents,
[3:36:05.200 --> 3:36:09.200]  but oh, you don't, you don't get to talk to the other side.
[3:36:09.200 --> 3:36:16.200]  And then you're defaulted and you go to a jury that's told you're guilty, not guilty until proven guilty, just you're guilty.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:19.200]  Forget guilty until proven innocent or innocent until proven guilty.
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:24.200]  You're now guilty and proven guilty and they're even on MSNBC saying this is the Alex Jones rule.
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:26.200]  Soon we'll take everyone off the air.
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:27.200]  We don't like.
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:30.200]  So the New York Times can say the father was lying.
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:35.200]  His daughter wasn't raped in Loudoun County, which the guys now pled guilty.
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:36.200]  Oh, the courts.
[3:36:36.200 --> 3:36:38.200]  Oh, that's free speech of the New York Times.
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:41.200]  But if Alex Jones questions some things, well, then you're just not allowed to do it.
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:42.200]  Norm Pat, it's good to have you on.
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:43.200]  I know you're a busy guy.
[3:36:43.200 --> 3:36:47.200]  You want to just go through each of these things I just put out starting with the default.
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:52.200]  Yeah, the default judgment is deeply depressing and shocking, but expect it.
[3:36:52.200 --> 3:37:02.200]  I mean, in my view, it was the strategy, the grand strategy of the plaintiff lawyers, at least since I got involved in the case back in March of 2019 to seek a default.
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:16.200]  And I wondered why their primary lawyer, Chris Maddie, a former U.S. attorney, talks about their pursuit of justice and wanting a jury to hear the case.
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:26.200]  They showed an almost desperate desire to keep a jury from hearing the entire case and hence a largely contextual effort to get a default.
[3:37:26.200 --> 3:37:32.200]  The pity of it is they found a judge in the form of Barbara Bellis who was willing to buy into their theory.
[3:37:32.200 --> 3:37:38.200]  But here's the fact, you've provided at least 80 to 100,000 documents.
[3:37:38.200 --> 3:37:40.200]  If not more, I've lost track.
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:50.200]  Your people have been, many of your employees, including Owen, have sat for depositions which were wide-ranging and broad in scope.
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:55.200]  We have begun the process of deposing all of the plaintiffs.
[3:37:55.200 --> 3:38:01.200]  I am barred by a court order from talking about what I learned in the depositions of the plaintiffs.
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:14.200]  A court order that the plaintiffs lawyers have enforced stringently such that when I made reference to what occurred in a deposition, in a public pleading, they moved for sanctions against me.
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:19.200]  And the judge held that that was one of the reasons why you should be defaulted.
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:22.200]  That's a decision I made, not a decision you made.
[3:38:22.200 --> 3:38:29.200]  And I don't think it did violate the order, but Judge Bellis ruled otherwise and that's what appellate courts are for.
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:31.200]  So again, why was that held against you?
[3:38:31.200 --> 3:38:46.200]  In terms of Google Analytics, we provided them to the other side the very day that the judge sanctioned you for a rant on the year involving whoever had sent an open child porn to you.
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:38:50.200]  Then thereafter, we took the position that Discovery closed.
[3:38:50.200 --> 3:39:01.200]  The judge faults the lawyers for not certifying that and giving it to the other defendants at a time when we took the position Discovery was closed.
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:11.200]  Again, another claim that one of the other lawyers representing you was too aggressive with a witness and a deposition, as though that were your responsibility.
[3:39:11.200 --> 3:39:13.200]  That's ridiculous.
[3:39:13.200 --> 3:39:20.200]  As to financial documents, you brought in an independent CPA to assist with identification of documents.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:24.200]  Those documents were provided to somebody who was deposed.
[3:39:24.200 --> 3:39:28.200]  That person is not a managerial person.
[3:39:28.200 --> 3:39:29.200]  It's a bookkeeper.
[3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:32.200]  The court referred to that as a managerial person.
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:42.200]  Furthermore, they concluded that we hadn't provided the very documents that our accountant said was responsive to the pleading, was responsive to the request.
[3:39:42.200 --> 3:39:47.200]  When the other side complained, the court just decided not to believe our CPA.
[3:39:47.200 --> 3:39:56.200]  There was no evidentiary hearing, no opportunity for us to be heard, to present our point of view, to present our reasons for relying on our CPA of choice.
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:40:01.200]  I had the impression, as I watched, and now she's attacking.
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:03.200]  She attacked me previously.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:08.200]  She referred me to grievance authorities for a decision I made in taking an affidavit of you.
[3:40:08.200 --> 3:40:15.200]  I took that case to trial, and, one, unsatisfied with that, she demanded that I provide her with a written copy of the decision.
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:23.200]  She's now attacked another one of your lawyers, and there'll be a hearing, I believe, in December, where his law license is at issue.
[3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:37.200]  We have filed a motion to recuse her, that is, to ask her to step off the case, because it appears to us that she's no longer impartial, that in effect she's joined the plaintiff's team, and we've lost confidence in her.
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:39.200]  She ruled on her own.
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:41.200]  Oh, no, I'm not going to recuse myself.
[3:40:41.200 --> 3:40:43.200]  I'm not even entitled to a hearing.
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:50.200]  So, last Friday night, we filed an appeal, an emergency appeal, in the state supreme court, asking them to hear this.
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  I don't know whether they will, odds are they won't.
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:40:59.200]  And, Norm, you're Greg, giving everybody what's happening at Point Blank Range, but what about the 35,000-foot view?
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  Owen was sued in Texas by the Sandy Hood crew.
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:08.200]  And he was defaulted, though he was never subpoenaed or ever deposed in Texas.
[3:41:08.200 --> 3:41:09.200]  That's unprecedented.
[3:41:09.200 --> 3:41:13.200]  They never ask for anything, and then he gets defaulted, and he's guilty, too.
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:15.200]  I mean, I've talked to a bunch of lawyers, including you.
[3:41:15.200 --> 3:41:18.200]  Is that not next level?
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:20.200]  Yeah, it is next level.
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:22.200]  And I'd like to correct your vocabulary.
[3:41:22.200 --> 3:41:24.200]  You haven't been found guilty of anything.
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:29.200]  You've been defaulted, which means they have their liability.
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:36.200]  Certain themes will now be deemed to have been proven, but the Sandy Hood families still have to prove damages.
[3:41:36.200 --> 3:41:41.200]  And I do not want to come close to violating a court order and have to defend my law license again.
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:46.200]  And I'm not going to attack Judge Bellis personally, but I will say this much.
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:53.200]  In my opinion, there is no question in my mind that this litigation is intended to put you out of business,
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:59.200]  has been permitted to become a wholesale, broadside attack on info wars and everything it stands for.
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:03.200]  And furthermore, I'll assert and hope that we get to trial on this issue,
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:08.200]  the plaintiffs do not have a coherent theory of damages.
[3:42:08.200 --> 3:42:13.200]  And as a matter of law, no jury should be permitted to hear based on what I've heard.
[3:42:13.200 --> 3:42:15.200]  And I can't tell you what it is.
[3:42:15.200 --> 3:42:18.200]  I can't even tell you what I've heard under these court orders,
[3:42:18.200 --> 3:42:23.200]  so the Sandy Hood plaintiffs are given privileged treatment in this case.
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:26.200]  Stay right there, Norm. Here's the bottom line.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:30.200]  They've been defaming me. The whole thing's been inaccurate.
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:35.200]  And now when it comes down to juries and it comes down to me being able to put on evidence, they can't have that.
[3:42:35.200 --> 3:42:39.200]  So now the First Amendment and all the other Bill of Rights has to go out the window
[3:42:39.200 --> 3:42:43.200]  all because some big billionaires got behind in finance lawsuits against Alex Jones.
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:49.200]  And then we've got clips when we come back of MSNBC where they're bragging, saying, now we'll get all the other nationalists.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:53.200]  We're going to use this system of default to shut everybody down.
[3:42:53.200 --> 3:42:55.200]  Frank in North Carolina.
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:43:01.200]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:05.200]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out.
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:12.200]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator, and we are powerful.
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:15.200]  The social engineers fear that so much.
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:20.200]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy.
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:22.200]  Is it true?
[3:43:22.200 --> 3:43:28.200]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[3:43:28.200 --> 3:43:33.200]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:41.200]  because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a loser.
[3:43:41.200 --> 3:43:45.200]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars on the air now more than ever.
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:51.200]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:55.200]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  Randy Dewright.
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:03.200]  Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:06.200]  Challenge first of all. Let me say I love your products.
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:12.200]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[3:44:12.200 --> 3:44:17.200]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:23.200]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:25.200]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  And I was already taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:37.200]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[3:44:37.200 --> 3:44:44.200]  but you know, over a period of time I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful.
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:49.200]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:54.200]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:44:54.200 --> 3:45:02.200]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:08.200]  Not in Communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:12.200]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  And that's done by design.
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:19.200]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:24.200]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment that founded the Bilderberg Group,
[3:45:24.200 --> 3:45:29.200]  the trilateral commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[3:45:29.200 --> 3:45:35.200]  Until ten years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg Group, didn't exist.
[3:45:35.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:44.200]  and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:49.200]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:53.200]  about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:55.200]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[3:45:55.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  I'm sitting here. It's in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:08.200]  reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[3:46:08.200 --> 3:46:13.200]  that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:19.200]  because in studies they did on children, it caused myocarditis, that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[3:46:19.200 --> 3:46:24.200]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the Associated Press, it's not getting any circulation.
[3:46:24.200 --> 3:46:28.200]  It's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter.
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:29.200]  It's just crazy.
[3:46:29.200 --> 3:46:34.200]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[3:46:34.200 --> 3:46:39.200]  It doesn't hurt anybody. Your conspiracy theorists, if you say it, it's just crazy.
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:44.200]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to cause heart problems.
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:47.200]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:46:49.200]  That's why info wars is on air.
[3:46:49.200 --> 3:46:52.200]  Because if we weren't on air, they'd get away with even more of this crap.
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:47:10.200]  This is just insane. These people are killers.
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:26.200]  Final segment in the Alex Jones show for November 16th, 2021, but the water room with Owen Schroyer is coming up.
[3:47:26.200 --> 3:47:41.200]  I don't want to get into his criminal cases, January 6th in general and the forced inoculations and vaccine databases and all of it, but in a sports metaphor, because you used to do sports radio.
[3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:58.200]  It'd be like if you were in a football team, say a linebacker, and you hadn't had any fouls or any flags thrown on you in the first few quarters, and then your team's winning and you just made a really good play, and then the referee just says eject it for unsportsmanlike conduct.
[3:47:58.200 --> 3:47:59.200]  You go, what do I do?
[3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:00.200]  They go, I'm not going to tell you.
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:01.200]  Default.
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:02.200]  Again, you can argue Alex Jones.
[3:48:02.200 --> 3:48:07.200]  They can put their little lies down, you know, that, oh, oh, Jones didn't give us this, didn't give us that.
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:08.200]  This is fake.
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:09.200]  That's fake without any proof.
[3:48:09.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  I mean, it's all my children.
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:12.200]  We didn't do anything they say.
[3:48:12.200 --> 3:48:13.200]  It's incredible.
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:14.200]  And it doesn't make me feel like a victim.
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:17.200]  It freaks me out that these people are this.
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:20.200]  I mean, this is like, this is like highway robber stuff.
[3:48:20.200 --> 3:48:26.200]  This is like serious fraud stuff, judicial misconduct, whatever you want to call it, but they're all just Trump deranged.
[3:48:26.200 --> 3:48:31.200]  Oh, the people protesting us at the, at the, at the schools are terrorists.
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:38.200]  Now it turns out the justice department was directing it and threat tagging people, parents as terrorists.
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:43.200]  And, but then Black Lives Matter comes in and says, I'll kill everybody in a thousand troops ready to murder you.
[3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:44.200]  And they go, that's good.
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:45.200]  That's good.
[3:48:45.200 --> 3:48:46.200]  No, he recently hawk.
[3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:48.200]  I forget the guy's name, hawk something.
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:55.200]  He then he said, if, if they do stop in Frisk in New York again, which it looks like the mayor Eric Adams, former police officer is going to implement with street closed cops.
[3:48:55.200 --> 3:48:57.200]  He says that there will be bloodshed now.
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:00.200]  So, but he's, he's not a threat, but a mom saying, I don't want pedophiles.
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:01.200]  He's my kid.
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:02.200]  She's bad.
[3:49:02.200 --> 3:49:07.200]  So, so, oh, and what is the, what is the analogy here in, in football or baseball or basketball?
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:09.200]  Because you, they never submitted you.
[3:49:09.200 --> 3:49:12.200]  They never, in Texas, they did in New York.
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:14.200]  They're suing you in Texas and just default.
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:17.200]  You never communicated with you, never asked you for anything.
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:18.200]  You're not even human.
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:22.200]  Yeah, like I'm, I'm sitting on the bench of a football team.
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:26.200]  I'm sitting on the bench and there's a game going on and I'm just, I'm just not playing.
[3:49:26.200 --> 3:49:29.200]  And then all of a sudden the ref gets on the mic and he just says, my number's 15.
[3:49:29.200 --> 3:49:32.200]  He just says, number 15 is ejected from the ball game.
[3:49:32.200 --> 3:49:36.200]  And I'm just standing on the bench like, well, I haven't even been on the field.
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:37.200]  Certainly this is a mistake.
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:38.200]  I'm not even playing.
[3:49:38.200 --> 3:49:39.200]  I haven't even been on the field.
[3:49:39.200 --> 3:49:41.200]  I was just getting my teammate of water over here.
[3:49:41.200 --> 3:49:42.200]  What do you mean?
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:43.200]  What do you mean I'm ejected?
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:46.200]  Yeah, I ejected 50 or, or, you know, or.
[3:49:46.200 --> 3:49:47.200]  And find $100,000.
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:49.200]  That's suspended five games.
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:51.200]  You keep talking away at $200,000.
[3:49:51.200 --> 3:49:52.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:49:55.200]  But, oh, I mean, or you could go with this one too.
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:57.200]  It's Tom Brady's one.
[3:49:57.200 --> 3:49:59.200]  We laugh at this, but this is really happening.
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:01.200]  Gallows humor at this point.
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:02.200]  Okay.
[3:50:02.200 --> 3:50:04.200]  Tom Brady won the Super Bowl last year.
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:05.200]  Nope.
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:07.200]  The Chiefs win by default.
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:10.200]  We just, we default and the Chiefs, the Chiefs win.
[3:50:10.200 --> 3:50:15.200]  It doesn't matter that they're like, we saw the Chiefs stabbing other players with daggers.
[3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:16.200]  You know, where's the footage?
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:17.200]  We're not showing it to you.
[3:50:17.200 --> 3:50:19.200]  Just they did this.
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:20.200]  Yeah.
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:22.200]  And we know that you gave them the daggers too.
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  You did that.
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:24.200]  So, so yeah, it's your fault.
[3:50:24.200 --> 3:50:26.200]  And we just by default, the Chiefs win.
[3:50:26.200 --> 3:50:28.200]  So, you know, to most people, this is a.
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:31.200]  Tom Brady's here a hand grenade at him in the last quarter.
[3:50:31.200 --> 3:50:32.200]  Where's the video of that?
[3:50:32.200 --> 3:50:33.200]  Well, we don't need to show it to you.
[3:50:33.200 --> 3:50:34.200]  He blew their legs off.
[3:50:34.200 --> 3:50:35.200]  I didn't see any.
[3:50:35.200 --> 3:50:40.200]  But no, so it's one thing because a lot of people are just observers of this.
[3:50:40.200 --> 3:50:42.200]  And I'm not, I'm not knocking people.
[3:50:42.200 --> 3:50:44.200]  They're just, they're not, they're not under the attack that you're under there.
[3:50:44.200 --> 3:50:45.200]  We're under here.
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:49.200]  But when you're, when you're actually living this and you know, you're being lied about
[3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:50.200]  constantly.
[3:50:50.200 --> 3:50:51.200]  It's hilarious.
[3:50:51.200 --> 3:50:52.200]  It really is a weird thing.
[3:50:52.200 --> 3:50:55.200]  It's like, cause it's a moment of like, oh my gosh, this is the state of the world.
[3:50:55.200 --> 3:50:57.200]  So then a moment of humor of just how.
[3:50:57.200 --> 3:50:58.200]  Wow.
[3:50:58.200 --> 3:50:59.200]  They're all real serious.
[3:50:59.200 --> 3:51:01.200]  They're all real serious about it.
[3:51:01.200 --> 3:51:03.200]  Why don't you know we're very honorable?
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:04.200]  I'm sorry.
[3:51:04.200 --> 3:51:05.200]  I'm sorry.
[3:51:05.200 --> 3:51:07.200]  They're desperate though.
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:09.200]  The whole thing's coming down.
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:10.200]  Norm Pattis, sorry.
[3:51:10.200 --> 3:51:11.200]  Hey, it's good to have you here, Norm.
[3:51:11.200 --> 3:51:13.200]  Norm, segue into Owen.
[3:51:13.200 --> 3:51:18.200]  What do you think of that federal filing in response to your filing saying Owen wasn't
[3:51:18.200 --> 3:51:20.200]  with us and police told Owen to leave?
[3:51:20.200 --> 3:51:22.200]  I mean, none of it's on the video.
[3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:23.200]  They even cite this is next level.
[3:51:23.200 --> 3:51:25.200]  What do you, what do you say there?
[3:51:25.200 --> 3:51:27.200]  I say we're going to have to have a trial.
[3:51:27.200 --> 3:51:32.200]  The evidence as I understand it is Owen was there to exercise his right to petition for
[3:51:32.200 --> 3:51:37.200]  the address of grievance to assemble with others, both guaranteed under the First Amendment
[3:51:37.200 --> 3:51:42.200]  that barriers had been removed as the crowd reacted and appeared to be verging toward
[3:51:42.200 --> 3:51:43.200]  violence.
[3:51:43.200 --> 3:51:49.200]  You, Alex, used a megaphone to encourage them not to give people what they wanted, not to
[3:51:49.200 --> 3:51:51.200]  act up, to remain peaceful.
[3:51:51.200 --> 3:51:56.200]  Owen stood in a location that he was, he was directed to stand at and given permission
[3:51:56.200 --> 3:51:59.200]  to stand as you exhorted people to remain peaceful.
[3:51:59.200 --> 3:52:04.200]  That's what the evidence will show at trial where the guy, how the government has come
[3:52:04.200 --> 3:52:06.200]  up with information that is contrary to that.
[3:52:06.200 --> 3:52:08.200]  I guess we're going to have to have a trial.
[3:52:08.200 --> 3:52:10.200]  We're going to challenge its authenticity.
[3:52:10.200 --> 3:52:14.200]  We're going to challenge when it was created and we're going to show the evidence we have.
[3:52:14.200 --> 3:52:20.200]  Now, question in, in, in, you know, in, in DC, are we going to find a jury that will be
[3:52:20.200 --> 3:52:22.200]  honest enough to follow the facts and acquit Owen?
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:26.200]  Well, I'm going to look for one and I'm going to do my level best to find one.
[3:52:26.200 --> 3:52:29.200]  But, you know, the whole January 6th thing, I heard you guys talking about Newsom, Hawke
[3:52:29.200 --> 3:52:32.200]  Newsom, that's the name, Owen, that you were reaching for.
[3:52:32.200 --> 3:52:35.200]  Let's talk about Newsom and contrast him to Kyle Rittenhouse.
[3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:41.200]  Hawke Newsom said on CNN, when cities were burning, if we don't get what we want, there's
[3:52:41.200 --> 3:52:43.200]  going to be more violence.
[3:52:43.200 --> 3:52:44.200]  That's not a threat.
[3:52:44.200 --> 3:52:45.200]  That's just hypothetical.
[3:52:45.200 --> 3:52:47.200]  And nobody blinked an eye.
[3:52:47.200 --> 3:52:51.200]  We had mostly peaceful protests as we watched cities burn on the air.
[3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:53.200]  Kyle Rittenhouse went out.
[3:52:53.200 --> 3:52:58.200]  Some people physically attacked him, put him in imminent risk of danger and the perception
[3:52:58.200 --> 3:53:00.200]  of death, and he shot himself in the fence.
[3:53:00.200 --> 3:53:03.200]  And, and you would, and people want him strung up immediately.
[3:53:03.200 --> 3:53:06.200]  And there's a threat of future violence if he's not convicted.
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:09.200]  This country has gone off of its rocker.
[3:53:09.200 --> 3:53:15.200]  When Hawke Newsom can exhort people not so subtly to violence to burn a city down and
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:18.200]  threaten to do so again if he doesn't get what he wants.
[3:53:18.200 --> 3:53:22.200]  And a young man shoots to kill to defend himself from somebody armed with a gun or
[3:53:22.200 --> 3:53:26.200]  with a physical object, a.k.a. the skateboard, to clock him in the head.
[3:53:26.200 --> 3:53:28.200]  There's just something wrong with this country.
[3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:29.200]  And I stand with you.
[3:53:29.200 --> 3:53:31.200]  I stand with Owen.
[3:53:31.200 --> 3:53:35.200]  I represent you too proudly and without, without excuse.
[3:53:35.200 --> 3:53:41.200]  In the foxhole that has become America, I want to be in it with info wars, not with the
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:46.200]  politically righteous, not with the woke, who are attacking values that I regard as fundamental.
[3:53:46.200 --> 3:53:49.200]  So Owen's going to have his jury trial.
[3:53:49.200 --> 3:53:54.200]  I don't think there's a way to take a jury trial away yet in the United States.
[3:53:54.200 --> 3:53:59.200]  You will have a jury trial of some sort, info wars as to the civil action.
[3:53:59.200 --> 3:54:02.200]  We've not yet begun to fight seriously on that issue.
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:04.200]  And there's a lot of fight left in us.
[3:54:04.200 --> 3:54:09.200]  I hope your, your listeners will rally behind you because from my perspective in the trenches
[3:54:09.200 --> 3:54:15.200]  of the American criminal and civil justice system, there is a war going on for the American soul.
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:17.200]  There is an emerging police state.
[3:54:17.200 --> 3:54:21.200]  There is a threat to liberties that are fundamental in our country.
[3:54:21.200 --> 3:54:25.200]  And they're being stripped away one ruling at a time.
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:28.200]  And people seem afraid to speak out.
[3:54:28.200 --> 3:54:30.200]  And I don't understand it.
[3:54:30.200 --> 3:54:35.200]  I listened to a prior guest of yours today while I was online and he talked about protests and
[3:54:35.200 --> 3:54:36.200]  there only being a thousand.
[3:54:36.200 --> 3:54:42.200]  And he asked, do we need to resort to ironic humor, vicious humor, you know, to educate people?
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:43.200]  Maybe we do.
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:47.200]  I mean, I still am naive enough to believe in the rule of law.
[3:54:47.200 --> 3:54:51.200]  I'm still determined enough to take the legal doctrines that I can identify and the tools
[3:54:51.200 --> 3:54:55.200]  that I've been trained to use and have used for 30 years.
[3:54:55.200 --> 3:55:01.200]  And I will walk into any courtroom that will let me in to defiantly proclaim that I believe
[3:55:01.200 --> 3:55:07.200]  you have the right to speak freely, that Owen had the right to petition for the redress of grievances.
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:12.200]  That January 6th was far less a threat to what this country stands for than what went on
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:17.200]  throughout most of the summer of 2020 and that people who pretend to say otherwise have
[3:55:17.200 --> 3:55:23.200]  an agenda to transform this country into a place I do not want to live.
[3:55:23.200 --> 3:55:25.200]  So, you know, keep up the good work, guys.
[3:55:25.200 --> 3:55:29.200]  And thank you so much for the honor and privilege of representing you.
[3:55:29.200 --> 3:55:30.200]  Well, you bet, Norm.
[3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:32.200]  But I mean, you're also fighting a bunch of cases.
[3:55:32.200 --> 3:55:34.200]  What do you make of the on the vaccine front?
[3:55:34.200 --> 3:55:40.200]  The fifth circuit really slapping down the obviously unconstitutional mandates of Biden
[3:55:40.200 --> 3:55:42.200]  for just 60 seconds on that.
[3:55:42.200 --> 3:55:47.200]  The political issue, one of the most political issues of the next 10 years will be the development
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:50.200]  of what I call a national police power.
[3:55:50.200 --> 3:55:56.200]  And so we see it rolled out in response to the vaccine, to the COVID-19, you know, crisis.
[3:55:56.200 --> 3:55:59.200]  And Biden overreached with his vaccine mandate.
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:02.200]  There is no national federal police power.
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:08.200]  We've been challenging various state applications of it throughout the country with mixed results,
[3:56:08.200 --> 3:56:11.200]  as I heard you say before, when some lose some.
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:16.200]  But this issue will be before the U.S. Supreme Court within this next year or the following year.
[3:56:16.200 --> 3:56:21.200]  And that is the extent to which the central government at the federal level has the ability
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:24.200]  to declare minimal conditions consistent with the public health.
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:27.200]  And we politically need to let them know we're not going to stand for this.
[3:56:27.200 --> 3:56:28.200]  I mean, absolutely.
[3:56:28.200 --> 3:56:34.200]  And if we because if they win on COVID-19, which is the easy case, then that same body of law
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:38.200]  is going to be used for guns, it's going to be used to attack so-called systemic racism.
[3:56:38.200 --> 3:56:40.200]  It's going to be used on behalf of climate change.
[3:56:40.200 --> 3:56:46.200]  And the parody you do of Dr. Fauci and others, you know, wanting us to have the chips in our teeth
[3:56:46.200 --> 3:56:52.200]  and the vaccine passports and do everything that we can for righteousness sake, that will come true.
[3:56:52.200 --> 3:56:57.200]  And the thing that's terrifying to me about it is it's going to be giving other mortals
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:01.200]  who are every bit as fallible as us, the ability to tell us how to live.
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:07.200]  No, that's right. And in closing, Norm, I have, you know, the Democratic Party, MSNBC, CNN,
[3:57:07.200 --> 3:57:11.200]  London Guarding, and they're all bragging, oh, it's the Alex Jones rule.
[3:57:11.200 --> 3:57:14.200]  We're going to get rid of everybody's free speech using this Alex Jones case.
[3:57:14.200 --> 3:57:18.200]  So they're licking their lips with this garbage they're doing to us.
[3:57:18.200 --> 3:57:19.200]  But I got news for them.
[3:57:19.200 --> 3:57:20.200]  They're not taking us off the air.
[3:57:20.200 --> 3:57:21.200]  They're not shutting me up.
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:25.200]  And we need the listeners to buy the products and spread the word and make us stronger in this fight
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:27.200]  because our fight is everybody's fight.
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:31.200]  Norm Pattis, pattislaw.com, thank you so much. Owen, get suited up.
[3:57:31.200 --> 3:57:33.200]  You're about to take over in the war room.
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:35.200]  We've got the new trailer for the Big Flint interview.
[3:57:35.200 --> 3:57:37.200]  I thought you were saying it's going to air at the start of your show.
[3:57:37.200 --> 3:57:41.200]  So everybody on radio stations, pick up the war room and the destroyer
[3:57:41.200 --> 3:57:44.200]  or find it at bandodvideoinfowars.com for our show.
[3:57:44.200 --> 3:57:45.200]  I'm up here working.
[3:57:45.200 --> 3:57:50.200]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing Pollen Block.
[3:57:50.200 --> 3:57:56.200]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[3:57:56.200 --> 3:58:03.200]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:58:03.200 --> 3:58:08.200]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:58:08.200 --> 3:58:12.200]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:15.200]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[3:58:15.200 --> 3:58:18.200]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[3:58:18.200 --> 3:58:23.200]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:26.200]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[3:58:26.200 --> 3:58:28.200]  It is not an antihistamine.
[3:58:28.200 --> 3:58:33.200]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[3:58:33.200 --> 3:58:38.200]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:58:38.200 --> 3:58:40.200]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:58:40.200 --> 3:58:45.200]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[3:58:45.200 --> 3:58:51.200]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:58:51.200 --> 3:58:57.200]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[3:58:57.200 --> 3:59:01.200]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:59:01.200 --> 3:59:04.200]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[3:59:04.200 --> 3:59:08.200]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence,
[3:59:08.200 --> 3:59:11.200]  hive mind, in less than nine years.
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:15.200]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening,
[3:59:15.200 --> 3:59:18.200]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[3:59:18.200 --> 3:59:20.200]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:59:20.200 --> 3:59:23.200]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:59:23.200 --> 3:59:26.200]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:59:26.200 --> 3:59:29.200]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[3:59:29.200 --> 3:59:32.200]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[3:59:32.200 --> 3:59:36.200]  And so we must prepare, get up to a years worth of storable foods,
[3:59:36.200 --> 3:59:41.200]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[3:59:41.200 --> 3:59:45.200]  and lifesaving knowledge at infowarsstore.com.
[3:59:45.200 --> 3:59:52.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
