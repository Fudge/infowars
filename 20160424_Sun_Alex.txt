[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, another Global Broadcast. I'm your host Alex Jones and we're going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.000]  As we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central and I return weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central time.
[00:45.000 --> 00:56.000]  This is InfoWars radio slash television merged so that we can document the claims we're making here to another level.
[00:56.000 --> 01:08.000]  Now coming up, I do want to open the phones up on the Sunday broadcast and I also want to try to get to as much news as possible because there's just so much to cover here.
[01:08.000 --> 01:23.000]  But first off, we need to really get the word out to everybody that the entire modern liberal social engineering movement is about causing discord and unhappiness in the general population.
[01:23.000 --> 01:32.000]  And then misdirecting the rebellion that's being stirred up by the system into establishing even greater forms of oppression and tyranny.
[01:32.000 --> 01:40.000]  And a great example of that is a story that's the top of Drudge. Drudge has big screenshots of it. It's also up on infowars.com.
[01:40.000 --> 01:53.000]  There's Beyonce Urban Terrorists in new video, baseball bat rampage. And we'll play some of the video. Video, we can't play the audio because there's so much cussing.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  And you already see the Super Bowl with her up there in a anti-police rant.
[02:00.000 --> 02:10.000]  And then now we see her running around with a bunch of little girls skipping behind her. The message is learning how to be a woman is smashing cars up with a baseball bat because you hate men.
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  So war against the police, war against men, that's going to really get you ahead in life.
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.000]  And then everybody sits there, I guess in Chicago especially, who's seen their crime rate double, already the highest crime rate in the world until 2015.
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  Since then, since the middle of 2015, a year later, according to the Associated Press, the crime rate has doubled.
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  Now obviously there are problems with our militarized police. There are obviously issues. I'm someone who's exposed them, one of the most prominent people.
[02:40.000 --> 02:53.000]  But that doesn't mean we just blame the average police officer. We blame ourselves for allowing our government to be run by criminals that are turning the police into tools of control.
[02:53.000 --> 03:05.000]  But then when you condition the public to run around and act like wild criminals in the street, no, she's a beautiful woman now because she's out smashing everything, engaging these forms of anarchy behavior,
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  you're setting these groups up to be basically imprisoned, to basically be set up and to play the role of criminals.
[03:12.000 --> 03:25.000]  And I talked about MTV in the early 1990s, a lot of top rock stars that I personally know were called into meetings and told either merge with gangster rap or promote crime in the streets and drug dealing,
[03:25.000 --> 03:36.000]  or we're going to not air your music anymore. And of course a lot of hip hop folks have come out and said when they wouldn't go along, people, they're already very popular in the early 1990s.
[03:36.000 --> 03:45.000]  When they wouldn't go along with gangsterism and murder and criminality, they were told, okay, we're not going to air your stuff.
[03:45.000 --> 03:54.000]  So this is what the establishment wants. And Beyonce and all these other groups act like they're all gangster and they're tough and they're cool.
[03:54.000 --> 04:09.000]  They're on Sumner Redstone's Viacom, MTV, the biggest news corporation, biggest media corporation in the world, own CBS, you name it. They are on the Super Bowl, Fox.
[04:09.000 --> 04:19.000]  And this is what they're pushing as we sit here and critique this garbage being pointed at children, being pushed to the population, fireballs going off, anarchy.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  In real world, a woman running around doing this will get shot. Just like the lady we saw two weeks ago with a battle axe, trying to kill a cop.
[04:26.000 --> 04:35.000]  And the Black Lives Matter people freaked out. She'd already battle-axed one person, tried to battle-ax the cop, he shot her, and people said it was wrong.
[04:35.000 --> 04:46.000]  You've got her as a wild-eyed woman running around, and you've got Michelle Obama. It's all a script, out saying, how dare Louisiana and other states pass laws saying Christians can't be persecuted.
[04:46.000 --> 04:58.000]  She's all upset and mad about it, a commencement speech, and all these foreign countries are canceling trips to the U.S., but not to Muslim countries where they behead homosexuals. That's okay.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  We're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[05:42.000 --> 05:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360WIN, and with the new auto-ship feature at infoorstore.com, this is a sure win.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  10% off on auto-ship. Win, win, win at infoorstore.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  And all auto-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[05:59.000 --> 06:17.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[06:30.000 --> 06:36.000]  A little sister who's the only one.
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  Hard to believe it's already Sunday, the 24th day of April 2016. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  We're going to be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  The weekday broadcast, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  InfoWars, family news, 7 o'clock, all-time Central. InfoWars.com, forward slash show.

[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  Including the free video feeds, audio feeds, and more.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  So you can also send that out on your email, Facebook, Twitter.
[07:33.000 --> 07:40.000]  The power of you, the audience, taking action and getting other folks to tune into the broadcast,
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  to watch the videos, to read the reports, to look at the legislation we're covering.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  We'll be earth-shattering. InfoWars, in its 21-year history, has already had a gigantic effect.
[07:50.000 --> 08:00.000]  And we've only begun to fight the metrics at which we operate are exponential, are compounding,
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  and are extremely, extremely effective thanks to you taking action.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  So I salute the listeners and viewers who are not behind us, but are, again, as I've said many times,
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  right beside us and at the heart of what we do.
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  I was watching a report on infowars.com yesterday, the David Knight filed,
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  where he was talking about why do we even have public restrooms.
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  The original term from a restroom is a privy, meaning private.
[08:30.000 --> 08:37.000]  And why in this so-called nation, or in the West for that matter, is the biggest issue we discuss,
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  people changing their sex, and who can go in what bathroom?
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  I mean, this is comical. This is the total joke.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  While our collective bill of rights is being shredded, our collective freedoms are being destroyed,
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  our sovereignty is being destroyed, trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of taxpayer dollars
[08:57.000 --> 09:04.000]  are signed on to prop up foreign banks, our government is opening our borders up to radical jihadists,
[09:04.000 --> 09:14.000]  there's an open attack on the family, and all we hear about all day is about how this company or that company
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  or this public school or that public school are creating new bathrooms or saying men can go in women's
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  and women can go in men's. This is all just a way you confuse a species.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  And in the globalist research, in the globalist think tank documents going back to the 50s and 60s,
[09:34.000 --> 09:41.000]  they talk about confusing the sexes for depopulation, opening salvo, pushing homosexuality.
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  That's a fact. We always preface this with we're not against gay people.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  I'm not going to use the politically correct word because as soon as you start using the politically correct word,
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  next it's you can't say mother or father because someone may not have a mother or father,
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  or someone may not be a he or she, so you can't say that. This is happening. This is the takeover of language.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  And I shouldn't have to or David Knight shouldn't have to preface. Listen, we're not against transgenders,
[10:07.000 --> 10:16.000]  but this whole agenda is about total federal and international control and you in laws about what type of bathrooms you have.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  Now, there's the headline from a year ago. Schoolchildren told to call kids purple penguins because boys and girls
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  are not inclusive to transgender. See, your identity can't exist. You must be assimilated.
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  And that's the real message pushed by all the big TV shows and movies for decades.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  I would wonder what is all this transgender stuff getting pushed?
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  And I thought it was just some Hollywood fetish or something.
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  No, then I read it into think tank documents that we've covered here and it's all about coming in,
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.000]  ending the family, the nuclear family, making the state in control, reducing population.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  And that's what's going on here.
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.000]  And the West, that's the most open and the most historically liberal is being targeted.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  The British government came out two weeks ago and said, do not travel to the North Carolina or to Louisiana
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  because they have root laws against you. All it says is Christians can't be persecuted for their beliefs.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  But even British newspapers went, but wait a minute, the very same British government doesn't tell you to go to Saudi Arabia
[11:25.000 --> 11:33.000]  or don't go to Dubai or wherever where you'll be killed if you're a homosexual.
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  Or Cirque du Soleil out of Canada canceled trips to the U.S. saying that our people are in danger of being attacked.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  Oh, bull, but are still going to Dubai and Saudi Arabia.
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  You there to CNN UK issues travel warning about anti-LGBT laws in the U.S.
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  So we have people running around having hissy-fitch and getting caught getting fake cakes,
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  that they get a cake from a store and then put insults about themselves on it just to get attention.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  And every day people get caught putting swastikas in their front yard or swastikas in their dorms
[12:11.000 --> 12:19.000]  or shame lacrosse team rape them and it always 99% of the time turns out to be pure bull.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  So this is what's going on.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  And then you see Beyonce in her new music video that's up on infowars.com.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  It's also on drugsreport.com.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  Urban terrorists in new video baseball bat rampage shows little girls skipping behind her
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  while she runs around blowing up buildings, burning things down, beating up cars with a baseball bat.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  And she looks hideously ugly.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  She just be that ugly, it's weird.
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  The most establishment Viacom, the most establishment Fox,
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  the most establishment attack the police riot, burn stuff.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  And it's all these cheering black people saying how great she is.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  This is what they're selling.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  And then even two of my friends have seen this in Austin the last few months.
[13:08.000 --> 13:17.000]  Groups of young black kids coming up to baseball fields and parts screaming for white people to get out and to leave.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  And you see the racial attacks in the news all over the country, but they try to spin it and say it isn't.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  And they sing the Beyonce songs when they do it.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  And this is just the government and the system dividing and conquering just like all the transsexual business.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  And then I was watching David Nye's report and I meant to actually print this article.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  I had even seen this a week ago and I hadn't even covered it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:50.000]  A federal judge ruled that boys in elementary school, middle school, high school can use the girls' showers and vice versa
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  if they see themselves as a girl even with males in Italia.
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  But then I remember another story about another federal judge got caught drunk in a parking lot peeing.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  I think a lot of people probably done that.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  And he got lost his job.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  Remember last year, I'm going to pull up both those articles for me.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  I forgot to tell you, sorry.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  When we come back, I'll give people examples, actual names.
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  I forgot to pull up from my stack.
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.000]  He lost his job for indecent exposure even though it was an adult cop driving by someone's door open peeing.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  Nobody could see it.
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  Yeah, there's the headline we'll put up on screen right now for TV viewers.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  California citizen's secret referendum to block transgender public bathroom use.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Petition currently bottled up in court.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  Yeah, that's another case.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  The one with the federal judge was ruled that boys can use girls' showers and vice versa.
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  Now imagine you've got an 11-year-old daughter and there's somebody that thinks they're a girl
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  and they walk in and they have male genitals.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  This is meant to just, this is the new rights, though.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  The NSA is going to spy on you.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  The border is going to be wide open.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  Foreign banks can rob you.
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  Federal court order school to allow girls to use boys' restroom.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Yeah, that's just the one on that.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  It's showers this last week.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  They ruled showers.
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  The ruling actually says showers.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  So, see, they give you all these faux rights.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  You have a right in Travis County where I live to pay for other people's abortions.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  They actually have a hospital tax tagged on your property tax.
[15:20.000 --> 15:27.000]  You have the right in San Francisco and many other cities to pay for 10, 20, 30 thousand dollar sex changes
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  and plastic surgery, fake breasts and everything.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  Hey, if a guy wants to have it cut off and have fake breasts, knock yourself out, bro.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  The point is I shouldn't have to, oh, I'm good.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  If I don't give you money, I'm a bigot.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  This is the mental illness.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  And this is psychologically done.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  How does America the Great Fall?
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  How does Europe fall?
[15:45.000 --> 15:49.000]  All discussing where they poo poo and pee pee in their wee-wees.
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  I mean, this is what we've become.
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  It's a rest of development in the population that we're given this mass mental illness.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say,
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  Secret 12 acts to super mail, brain force, prostagart, silverboard.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  I use them all.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  They're phenomenal.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  They work.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  Buy them folks.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  Thank you, brother.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[16:11.000 --> 16:17.000]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  Welcome to the Info War.
[16:19.000 --> 16:24.000]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Nace and I.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  What products are you taking?
[16:35.000 --> 16:43.000]  Everything from super mail to brain force to winter sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[16:43.000 --> 17:08.000]  So when I just free up everything and I just went to auto-fill.
[17:08.000 --> 17:28.000]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[17:28.000 --> 17:35.000]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.000]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[18:37.000 --> 18:44.000]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  I'll give the number out in the next segment.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  The news website is infowars.com.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  If that site's ever down, which it rarely is,
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  it's prismplanet.com's the backup. It's not just a mirror, it has some original content as well.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  It's also very important for all the viewers,
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  unless you're staying in contact with us with more and more censorship happening on Twitter, Facebook, even YouTube,
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  and big efforts to try to shut us up and others up that's been all over the news.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  This attack on free speech worldwide is intensifying.
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  Email's one of the hardest ways for them to block us.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  It's very important we send out a lot of exclusive content, news articles, videos,
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  you name it, at infowars.com.
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  Just put your email in there, or a new email you create,
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  and we will send you a lot of really exclusive information,
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  including a lot of promo codes, coupons, you name it,
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  for the store, infowarsstore.com.
[21:30.000 --> 21:36.000]  They carry some of the best books, videos, pro-liberty apparel, Hillary for Prison shirts,
[21:36.000 --> 21:41.000]  incredible nutraceuticals, and more, including the new Make America Free again.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  I've made a hat pretty much like Trump's Made America,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  a blue one, a camo one, and a red one.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  They're Made America Super High Quality, and we have those now available at infowarsstore.com.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  It's an example of why it's important to sign up for the free newsletter,
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  because there's a lot of promo codes that are in that hint, hint.
[21:56.000 --> 22:02.000]  Sometimes specials up to 50% just for people that are members of the info wars insider newsletter
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  The system does a lot to try to block folks from tuning into the broadcast,
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  so I suggest everybody do their best to get as many people to tune in as you can,
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  especially people that are tuning in on AM and FM stations around the country.
[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  It's so easy to tell your neighbors, your coworkers, folks at church,
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  you name it, to tune in to the local station you're listening to right now.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  You can send out the free iPhone app, droid app links to anybody as well.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  This is how we reach more people. It's simply amazing.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  Okay, let me just tell you in this segment what is coming up.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  I kind of went off on a jag about the whole transgender stuff.
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  We're going to get into huge news.
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  Senator investigating Clinton email says FBI could possibly leak info
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.000]  if the Justice Department does not call for her indictment.
[22:52.000 --> 22:57.000]  Clinton has also stormed Connecticut with an anti-gun message.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  A hilarious video and audio we're going to play.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  Donald Trump does hilarious impression of crooked Hillary as a robot
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  reading off teleprompters.
[23:06.000 --> 23:09.000]  Oh, the 9-11 commission tries to confuse the public and says,
[23:09.000 --> 23:13.000]  no Saudi smoking gun. The news has been running with this all weekend.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  The 9-11 commission took a report from the Bushes basically and certified it.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  That's not the congressional commission.
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  And now Obama says, oh, he's going to release parts of it.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  No, the whole thing. We know it's in it.
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  We know about the FBI and defense intelligence whistleblowers that were in Congress.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  I've interviewed a bunch of them.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  They know about the NORAD stand down and the hijackers from Saudi Arabia being protected.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  I've had the head of the embassy on you.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  They were told these guys are CIA.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  I don't care if it says they're all kind of let them in.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  They were protected.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  The Clintons and the Bushes protected them and they protected them right up to 9-11.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  And that needs to come out. We're going to break that down.
[23:55.000 --> 24:03.000]  The really big news memo, CDC officials warned of safety risk diseases and immigrant influx.
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  That story is on drugreport.com.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  Right hand column. It's an info wars.com.
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  Don Salazar article.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  And it's a sensational memo.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  Hillary considers all female ticket by choosing woman as vice president nominee.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  But in Telegraph UK, isn't that just special?
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  Yeah, the stunt of, you know, we've had the black guy.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Now it's the woman. Isn't about who's qualified.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  Isn't about who's a constitutionalist.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  No, no, no.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's about who is a woman. And in case Donald Trump or somebody nominates a VP woman while she wants to be all women.
[24:37.000 --> 24:45.000]  I'd go for two women if it was, say, and I'm not saying Michelle Bachman or a, or a, you know, another person is perfect.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  Like Sarah Palin, but they're better than Hillary and whoever she's going to pick.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Maybe Hillary will pick her girlfriend who's her chief of staff or whatever.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  So it's just all about total mindless stunts.
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  Hey, look, I'm a woman. I love you.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Oh, yeah. But she covered up all the rapes, of course.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  And the rest of it that her husband was involved in, very well known.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  So that's coming up as well.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  That's just some of what's coming up of a big science and technology stack.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  But since I mentioned this, let's get to this. Let's get to this right now.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  Remember, oh, back in 2000, and it was reported on 2002.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  ABC News got the memos and to their credit actually published it.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  Where the head of the CDC and this whole boardroom of top execs of the centers
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  of disease control was meeting and said, look, we got millions of kids with autism
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  directly linked to the bunch of our own studies to the vaccines causing some type
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  of autoimmune response in the brain and the gut.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  I won't give this to my grandkids. We got to warn our kids not to take it.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  But if we tell the public they're going to revolt, we've got to get the heads of
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  industry in and clean these things up.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  Now, you can just type in CDC, you know, secret meeting 2000 ABC News.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  It'll come up.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  The reason I mentioned that is here's another one.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  But this is on diseases.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  Now, folks, they have drug resistant and drug immune TB in Latin America
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  and in Pakistan in places.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  They've got it in Brazil, Nicaragua, El Salvador, places in India
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  that no drug will treat and that you get locked up for years until they quote
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  find some drug and the drugs are so toxic, they'll eat your liver half the time.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  I mean, they got antibiotics out now. They're so deadly, it's just over the top.
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  It's almost like chemotherapy. Yeah, it'll kill the TB. It'll also kill you.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  So memo, CDC officials warned of safety risk diseases among immigrant influx.
[26:41.000 --> 26:49.000]  Now, listen, this is from the CDC internal high level email that judicial watch
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  superstars with their lawsuits got via a four year lawsuit.
[26:53.000 --> 27:03.000]  We might as well plan on many of the kids having TB reads a redacted 2014 CDC email.
[27:03.000 --> 27:12.000]  Imagine what they redacted if this was in there. An internal memo circulated within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  shows the agency was well aware of many illegal alien minors and young adults entering the U.S.
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  Harvard communicable diseases. Yeah, you go to jail, they test you for TB.
[27:22.000 --> 27:28.000]  They do the antibody test and then they isolate you if you have it, but not your public school
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  because that'd be politically incorrect.
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  And of course, you could type in tuberculosis explodes in U.S. schoolchildren CDC and pull those articles up.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  In a memo obtained by the government watchdog judicial watch following a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  of Refugee Information Act request a high level government official urged employees to assume a large number of detained,
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  undocumented children at the Southwest border had tuberculosis.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  We might as well plan on many of the kids having TB reads a redacted 2016 email from Centers for Disease Control,
[27:59.000 --> 28:11.000]  Environmental Health Specialists Alaric C. Denton to Indiana Health Services Industrial Hygiene and Safety Management Board.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  Denton's email also spoke to the overwhelming, the close quote, scope of health efforts as well as he warned employees to be wary
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  of personal safety as many UACs, that's the undocumented, were not children but young adults.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  And then it goes on to protect yourselves, you know, wear a mask, whatever.
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  But don't tell the schools that you integrate them into.
[28:33.000 --> 28:41.000]  Like Anderson High, Maya Alma Mater, 231 Syrian refugees, children.
[28:41.000 --> 28:48.000]  Of them were told it's only a few thousand nationwide bullets thousands in Oslo and I checked they don't even test them, nothing.
[28:48.000 --> 28:53.000]  They just bring them in, they don't even know what planet they're on, just hacking and coughing all over the place.
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  But it's okay, okay, because we're politically correct now, we're putting in bathrooms.
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  A recent story by the Financial Times confirms that Daesh, also known as the Islamic State, was created in part by the Saudis.
[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  According to the late Saudi Foreign Minister, Islamic State was cobbled together in response to the Shia government in Iraq
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  following the U.S. invasion of the country and the execution of Saddam Hussein.
[29:15.000 --> 29:24.000]  The story ignores the fact the Saudis collaborated with the CIA and Pakistani intelligence to create the Afghan Arabs, which will become al-Qaeda.
[29:24.000 --> 29:31.000]  Other factions of the CIA organized and Saudi-funded Mujahideen coalesced into another fanatical Wahhabi group, the Taliban.
[29:31.000 --> 29:37.000]  In 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq merged with several other Sunni Wahhabi groups to form the Islamic State of Iraq.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  When the group moved into Syria in 2013, it became ISIS.
[29:41.000 --> 29:48.000]  The missing 28 pages will allegedly show Saudi complicity in the 9-11 attacks, but it will not show the role played by the CIA.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  The same can be said for the role played by the CIA and the Pentagon in the creation of terrorist groups.
[29:54.000 --> 30:19.000]  Read more right now at Infowars.com.

[33:02.000 --> 33:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:10.000 --> 33:16.000]  It was more than 100 years ago now.
[33:16.000 --> 33:25.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:25.000 --> 33:31.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[33:31.000 --> 33:39.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  Some people try to spin this broadcast and say it's gloom and doom, it's negative.
[33:43.000 --> 33:51.000]  No, it's very positive to talk about the engine of free market and human freedom and what we can do together.
[33:51.000 --> 34:01.000]  It's also very positive to expose what's rotten, what's bad, what's threatening our freedoms, the price of liberty's eternal vigilance.
[34:01.000 --> 34:12.000]  And the system wants us all chasing our tails, fighting with each other, men fighting with women, people fighting over what skin color they are, people obsessing over political correctness.
[34:12.000 --> 34:27.000]  While the robber barons run around establishing a private above the law corporate world government with diplomatic immunity, strip mining free humanity.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  That's what's happening. Strip mining free humanity.
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.000]  And what's crazy is this isn't my opinion. I've made films like Endgame. I've written books like The Sentin to Terranee.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  Well, the book and the film are free online.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  I have the quotes from the big think tank shots of the books.
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  Written by world leaders where they admit all this.
[34:50.000 --> 34:59.000]  That's the thing. Modern liberalism is meant to break up the family, make people totally dependent on the state and pour and dumb down.
[34:59.000 --> 35:07.000]  I remember reading a National Banking Association newsletter that went out in 1898.
[35:07.000 --> 35:12.000]  I remember covering it years ago. It's in several famous books, shots of it.
[35:12.000 --> 35:21.000]  It's only five or six pages long and it talks about Americans are responsible for most of the inventions. We have the highest literacy rate in the world now.
[35:21.000 --> 35:29.000]  Americans make politics a sport. They're obsessed with it. They are defeating our railroads or defeating our land takeovers.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  The robber barons are getting their butt kicked.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  And they said we're going to come out with national education.
[35:35.000 --> 35:45.000]  We're going to make it be something that is seen as a royalty, as a letter of mark, as a status symbol.
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.000]  We're going to have all these different, the theater and the fictional press.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  We're going to finance using British technologies. They write about it.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.000]  Systems already used in England to basically make it cool to be a slave.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  You try to read a newspaper from 115 years ago, I can hardly read it.
[36:06.000 --> 36:18.000]  How to read a newspaper from 200 years ago, it's amazing how big the vocabulary is, how complex it is, how there might be five, six newspapers per city battling it out over different perspectives.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  And things weren't perfect, but it was true Wild Wild West.
[36:22.000 --> 36:36.000]  Now it's just this drone system with a bunch of dependent people who want to have their bones earned, who want to go out and be warriors.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  We're told men aren't warriors now.
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.000]  No, no, no, you become a warrior watching Beyonce at the Super Bowl can't get more establishment than that.
[36:45.000 --> 36:58.000]  That's what they want you to see all pre approved. And on MTV with Beyonce running around, burning things down, blowing things up and attacking because she hates men and police.
[36:58.000 --> 37:07.000]  And then you watch almost every other show.
[37:07.000 --> 37:17.000]  Award show, music show, movie show, it's nothing but cultural war. This is an admitted weapon to screw everybody up.
[37:17.000 --> 37:24.000]  And then meanwhile, they want DNA testing for anyone to go to Kuwait just to just to fly in.
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  They take your blood, put it in the database, face, can your thumb print.
[37:28.000 --> 37:37.000]  Mexico gives you one year to six months hard labor and tortures you if you're caught illegally in the country. That's the London Guardian.
[37:37.000 --> 37:44.000]  We have some of the most lenient laws in this country when it comes to letting people live the way they want to live.
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.000]  And I'm an extremely libertarian person, but some of them go too far.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  Because now these groups are targeting kids and trying to get into the schools.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  I don't care if it's heterosexual, homosexual, what it is.
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.000]  But almost every Arab country and Muslim country executes you if you are a homosexual.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  But see, quote gay people in this country are so programmed on average that they don't care if people are chopping their heads off.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  They don't care if the British government or US government doesn't do a travel advisory to those countries.
[38:14.000 --> 38:21.000]  They want to talk about Louisiana or North Carolina because it says Christians can refuse service of somebody they don't want to bake a cake.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  Give me a break. It's all just a stunt to turn people against each other.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  Let me tell you the big secret of all the transgender stuff they're pushing in schools.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  When they make transgender's bathrooms and they make everything from the third grade on about brainwashing kids about what gender they want to be,
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  it's like the rollout of the automobile or the rollout of swimming pools.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.000]  A hundred years ago there weren't any swimming pools in people's houses.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  A hundred years ago there were hardly any cars.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  And I'm not saying swimming pools and cars are bad. It's an innovation.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  But you roll them out. They get popularized. People start thinking about it.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  People start getting a cement pond like the Beverly Hillbillies talk about.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  But we don't get cement ponds anymore. We don't get innovation.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  We don't have elites anymore that want us to get paid enough at work to buy one of their cars.
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  We have a post-industrial world, a post-population world where they don't want families or populations.
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.000]  They want negative growth. This is the admitted cosmology of Agenda 21.
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.000]  This is the eugenics system worldwide by UNESCO on record under international prety.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  What I'm telling you is fact.
[39:25.000 --> 39:33.000]  It is meant to force the culture to obsess on not knowing your sex, not knowing who you are.
[39:33.000 --> 39:44.000]  As chemicals are added in utero to fetuses that change the biological development of the brain and in many cases the sexual organs.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  And you can look up Pentagon planned gay bomb.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  You can look up Aldous Huxley, Julian Huxley, the plan to make homophrodis.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  First they're going to push the homosexual revolution, then the trans revolution, then the asexual revolution.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  It's going to get so confusing that they just say everybody is nothing.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  And that's what they now admit. Let's just be nothing.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  We'll all use one bathroom, one shower because you're not allowed your identity.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  You can't use the word mother or father, he or she because it hurts someone.
[40:13.000 --> 40:19.000]  That is so profound to say you can't be a male or you can't be a female.
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  And that's liberalism.
[40:24.000 --> 40:32.000]  That's liberalism to say you can't be a man, you can't be a female, you can't say he or she.
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  And I remember I covered this five years ago when only some colleges and high schools were doing it.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  People said that'll never happen here when it was happening in Europe.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  Now almost every high school in the U.S. and now it's going down to elementary school.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  Just like it started 20 years ago with one school banning dodgeball, then they all banned dodgeball.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  It's all UNESCO, UN treaty, the UN comes up with it, then we implement it.
[40:54.000 --> 41:01.000]  Isn't that the UN runs us, it's that the globalist, the robber barons, the Rockefellers created the UN on record,
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  created it to set the shop, then they transfer our power to it and then it dictates back to us.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  Like TPP, like NAU.
[41:10.000 --> 41:20.000]  They now admit today that they are merging the European Union with the Atlantic agreement with the North American Union.
[41:20.000 --> 41:27.000]  Obama has been in England and says don't leave the EU or your trade deals with the U.S. are over and threatened the U.K.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  And said we already have a trade deal, you can't leave, you already have one with us.
[41:31.000 --> 41:39.000]  Asian Union, European Union, American Union, all three unions, this is official.
[41:39.000 --> 41:44.000]  This is global governance, UN, this has been, this was in the newspapers in the 50s this plan.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  It's here, three mega unions under treaties tied to each other.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  And the three unions all have three jurisdictions.
[41:53.000 --> 42:04.000]  Three unions with the sub-unions, that is nine unions with a governmental final tenth union.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  You're like wow, I heard about that in Revelation.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  Yeah, either it's true and it's happening or they took it as a model.
[42:09.000 --> 42:18.000]  Three super regions with ten regions, nine of them physical regions, one of them a political super region.
[42:18.000 --> 42:27.000]  The tenth horn, the little horn, wow, heavy man, heavy, heavy, heavy, all happening.
[42:27.000 --> 42:35.000]  The Pope announcing global government, huge newspapers announcing we're all going to get chips to get prescriptions now, you'll have to have a chip.
[42:35.000 --> 42:46.000]  My dad's a physician, he went for continued medical training and was there with his mouth hanging open when he said within a few years you'll have to have a chip to get your prescription.
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.000]  It's coming, it's here. The churches won't warn you, they've been bought and paid for under the World Council of Churches.
[42:52.000 --> 43:18.000]  Look up who set that up, the Rockefellers again, the robber barons 100 years ago.
[43:22.000 --> 43:51.000]  It's coming, it's coming.
[43:51.000 --> 43:59.000]  Hey, how are you doing out there? Good brother.
[43:59.000 --> 44:07.000]  Just recently started using your products, everything you said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  Well, thank you brother, it's because it also funds our operation but doing that I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[44:12.000 --> 44:20.000]  Supermal vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[44:20.000 --> 44:29.000]  We do the supermal and the superfemale vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, statement ton of money there.
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.000]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[44:37.000 --> 44:49.000]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[44:49.000 --> 44:58.000]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your supermal vitality and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.

[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  Why, God, let me ask you a question, have they worked for you?
[45:31.000 --> 45:34.000]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  What products are you taking?
[45:35.000 --> 45:46.000]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Wintersun, X2, even got a little DNA force so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to AutoLive.

[46:58.000 --> 47:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:28.000 --> 47:36.000]  Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.000]  Divide and conquer, take it to the next level. That's what the new order is up to.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  And while the big mega banks are above the law and exempt themselves from everything they put on our backs, they teach us how to not discriminate.
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  Don't use the word mother or father. Boy or girl, he or she.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  They've already gotten to that point. What do you think is coming next?
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  It's like MSNBC says, we gotta get past the point of believing in parents.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  The state raises the children now.
[48:05.000 --> 48:17.000]  But meanwhile, the left won't criticize radical Islam that's taking over Islam and the 5 million plus immigrants, illegals.
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  I'm supposed to use the word illegal, brought into Europe.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  I guess the last few years it hadn't been illegal because Merkel and Hollande advertised for them to come in.
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  And then when they came in, did their TB and their hepatitis, no one's tested.
[48:33.000 --> 48:40.000]  While they're given jobs or old Germans or French are thrown out of their places and they're given government housing.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  That's all in the news.
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.000]  And the illegals in this country are allowed to come here and are legalized or not even tested for disease.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  Oh, but you've got to take all your vaccines to make sure everybody's safe.
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  Even though those vaccines don't protect you from what the illegals are bringing in.
[48:58.000 --> 49:14.000]  It's all about you putting in your body what the government says when it says never mind our government's been caught in thousands of declassified, lethal studies, nerve-gassing, microwaving, radiating little children.
[49:14.000 --> 49:21.000]  If you didn't know about those, you might just look up Atomic Energy Agency secret testing declassified stuff like that.
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  U.S. troops tested on lethal programs, Project Shad.
[49:25.000 --> 49:32.000]  Or most of you know about Tuskegee, 45 years of blacks being secretly injected with syphilis.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  So they'd go spread it in their communities.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  But what's wrong with a brain-eating microscopic worm?
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  It's Lyme's disease of the brain.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  What's wrong with that?
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  Let's trust this government.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  I'm sure they're a lot nicer now.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  One in 30,000 had autism 35 years ago, 30 years ago.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  Now it's one in 58, one in 57.
[49:58.000 --> 50:06.000]  CDC's own 15-year-old whistleblower document, the head of the CDC, with the research, they know what it's doing.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  They know.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Roll up your sleeve and take your shot.
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  They love you.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  How a now-retracted autism study went viral again.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  And then they've got more articles out trying to attack.
[50:22.000 --> 50:30.000]  Dr. Wakefield has been totally vindicated claiming, oh, there's no problems, even though the inserts of the vaccine say they can kill you.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  But let's go further now.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  Let's get into it.
[50:33.000 --> 50:47.000]  So memo, CDC officials warned of safety risks, diseases of an immigrant influx, things like drug-resistant TB, hepatitis A, B, and C, and all sorts of other third-world things like leprosy that's making a comeback here in the United States.
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  In fact, they say it's like epic level now in Florida, but big deal.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  It's something that eats your face off, you know.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  Go out and get leprosy to be in solidarity.
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  Report, children of refugees get more federal benefits than poor U.S. kids.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  Well, they've got to have some way to get them here.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  America loves kids, but Uncle Sam is a favorite.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  Children of refugees.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Oh, yeah, Uncle Sam, really.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  Who is Uncle Sam, a foreign-run federal government?
[51:16.000 --> 51:23.000]  Among recipients of food stamps, welfare, cash, and social security payments, refugee children receive more taxpayer-funded aid than children of citizens.
[51:23.000 --> 51:30.000]  This is a report by the Federal Spending and Promigration Migrant Policy Institute.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  They're just fighting over getting more.
[51:32.000 --> 51:37.000]  You see, it's all an incentive to get people here.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  Of course, once you're already born here, they don't care about you or even try to help you out.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  Here's another one.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  I want to play the audio of this.
[51:44.000 --> 51:53.000]  This is a point in FullWars.com, Gateway Pundit article, Muslim Migrants in Germany chant Adolf Hitler, who in a lot of Arab countries has like an 80% approval rating.
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  He's like a superstar over there.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  He didn't know Hitler in most Muslim countries.
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  He's like one of the most popular people.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  Seriously, look it up.
[51:59.000 --> 52:04.000]  I'm like, well, but that's okay with the left because, you know, that's another Hitler.
[52:04.000 --> 52:13.000]  Muslim Migrants in Germany chant Adolf Hitler and Allah Akbar.
[52:13.000 --> 52:24.000]  Syrian flag.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  With images of AK-47s on their necks saying free Palestine.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  And I'm not against Palestine or the Palestinians or anybody.
[52:30.000 --> 52:36.000]  The point is, you don't bring in 5 million of the military age men, almost all of the military age men.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  Most of them were fighters.
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  As some weird leftist time bomb op.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  I mean, look, Hillary Clinton on record is the commander of ISIS.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  It was Al Qaeda.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  That's all ISIS is that attacked in Benghazi.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  They shipped the weapons.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  I told you a week after it happened exactly what happened.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  It's now been all admitted.
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.000]  Again, we're right again, folks.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  We got the sources in because I'm crazy enough to go with the info.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  High level folks give me.
[52:57.000 --> 52:58.000]  Nobody else really will.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  More folks are nowadays.
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  It's good to have some companies.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  It's not as dangerous because look, I'm not looking to be the number one guy doing all this.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  I just keep stepping up the plate.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  So.
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  They advertise invade Syria for years.
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  The West attacks.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  The Russians go to feed them.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  So Turkey says, okay, come through here to Europe.
[53:17.000 --> 53:22.000]  They come into Europe and they run around chanting out all Hitler, Allah Akbar, raping and killing.
[53:22.000 --> 53:28.000]  And then the Germans, the Swiss, the Dutch, the French, just a whole bunch of other countries.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  Sweden makes it against the law for them to put in the news that it was a Muslim that rapes for kills.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  That's in the news.
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.000]  The United States encourages Britain to remain in the European Union.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  That's right.
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  She's joined the bandwagon.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  This is London Guardian with Obama saying, listen, don't have the bricks exit.
[53:48.000 --> 53:55.000]  Don't leave the EU even though they now make 90 plus percent of your laws and the EU bureaucracy is unelected.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  It's okay.
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  You need to let them keep running things or we will pull out of our treaties with you.
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  And Obama goes on to say because we're in a treaty with the EU that you're in.
[54:05.000 --> 54:13.000]  We've already merged in the Atlantic Treaty that his predecessor, Mr. Cameron's predecessor, signed on to.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  So there you go.
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.000]  Open world government, just like the Pope and the Communist Chinese tell us we can't have Donald Trump.
[54:20.000 --> 54:25.000]  Our president and would be new president, Hillary, are weighing in bullying.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  And there's an article.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  This is what is this out of Reuters.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  Obama tells British youth, don't pull back from the world.
[54:32.000 --> 54:41.000]  See, you're pulling back when you don't let unelected multinational corporations that loot through the EU make all your laws and appoint your leaders.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  Isn't that just special?
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  Isn't that just cute?
[54:44.000 --> 54:58.000]  U.S. President Obama implored young British people on Saturday not to pull back from the world a day after sparking a row or fight by bluntly telling Britain it should remain in the European Union to preserve its remaining global clout.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  And the true liberal mayor of London, I mean, he's liberal folks, has come out and said we should get out of this.
[55:05.000 --> 55:06.000]  It's tyranny.
[55:06.000 --> 55:07.000]  We're losing our sovereignty.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  This is global colonialism by megabanks.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  He's starting to become a fan of this guy.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  What happens when the real left emerges?
[55:15.000 --> 55:23.000]  Who are for, you know, social stuff liberal and even taxes, you know, want high taxes on the rich, which I'm not endorsing, but still I could live with that.
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  He just doesn't want to destroy the country and sign it over to multinationals.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  In fact, we have the clip.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  We probably should play it.
[55:29.000 --> 55:42.000]  Boris Johnson rages at ridiculous and weird Obama extraordinary statement to mock President over his threat to hold back trade deal in devastating intervention.
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  Boris Johnson has launched an astonishing attack on Obama's ridiculous and weird arguments for Britain to stay in the EU in a outspoken assault last night.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  The London mayor mocked the U.S. President.
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  In fact, we have that video.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  Okay.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  We have one of them defending the mocking.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  In an outspoken assault last night, the London mayor mocked the U.S. President.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  Controversial claim that the Anglo-U.S. trade deal would be hit by the Bricks exit.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  And he stepped up as war of words over Winston Churchill claiming that the wartime leader in the U.S.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  both stood for democracy and that the EU didn't.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  Yes.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  Lord Moncton and Nigel Farage, the heads of UKIP.
[56:20.000 --> 56:26.000]  We have them on 10 years ago, nobody knew what UKIP was, fastest growing party in Europe, fastest growing party in the UK.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  It's like libertarian Alex Jones party.
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  And they are taking over.
[56:31.000 --> 56:38.000]  And so even the less now is saying, wait a minute, 90% of our laws plus are made by the EU and it's unelected.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  The EU parliament is elected but has no power.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  I mean, look, you start talking about this, it's game over.
[56:46.000 --> 56:54.000]  The appointed government, TPP, merges the NAU, the EU and the Asia-Pacific unions together.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  We're going to open the phones up, folks.
[56:56.000 --> 57:03.000]  Next hour we're taking your phone calls on all these issues, on the campaign, on what's unfolding, on the cultural assault on the family.
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  All of it, 877-789 Alex.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  That's 877-789-2539, different number on Sundays.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  877-789-2539, it's first time callers in the first round.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  Let me add that, 877-789 Alex.
[57:18.000 --> 57:24.000]  Oh, don't forget infowarstore.com with the books, the videos, the new Make America Free Again hats.
[57:24.000 --> 57:25.000]  And so much more.

[57:38.000 --> 57:43.000]  Your funding of the Info War is absolutely essential and I want to thank all of you for support.
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  Second hour straight ahead, tell folks to tune in.
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  Call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  1-3-9 to order your ProMax shower filter from ProPure today.
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it.
[58:51.000 --> 58:56.000]  RobDoo joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  I get in here at 8.30.
[59:02.000 --> 59:04.000]  I was kind of run down.
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them.
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.000]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like...
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.000]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  Read about it. Find out why.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  I went home about 6.45 this morning.
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  Took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  at infowarslife.com
[59:43.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  or call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  I've said this hundreds of times. I think I should say it more.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  I think I should cut intro liners just to say it every hour.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  Once it is known that private megabanks are establishing an unelected corporate world government
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  and that sovereignty has already been ended
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  and that most nations are already under private corporate world government,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  it's game over.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  If we get the public educated before the smart grid
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  is in place and the big multinationals own all the robot farmers,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  all the robot trains, all the robot cars, all the robot facilities,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  the globalists admit they want to checkmate humanity
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  by getting most production in the hands of a technocracy where humans aren't needed,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  then the terms of surrender can be dictated.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  China's first security, robot debuts.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  China's people's daily.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Japan's next generation of farmers could be robots, Bloomberg.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  Look now, no hands. China's roadmaps to self-driving cars.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Meet Brad, the AI interrogator, virtual personal persona
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  taught to tell when people are really telling the truth.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Oh, the computer doesn't lie. Really, it's programmed to lie.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  How Facebook plans to take over the world.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  That's only part of that robot takeover stack.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  If you go back, I'm not bragging, and read stuff I wrote 20 years ago
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  or see films I made 20 years ago or 18 years ago, you'll go,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  this is exactly what's happening now because the white papers are public.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  I've read the books. I've done reviews of the books.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  I've made films about it. They've got a plan, folks,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  and we ain't in it to quote George Carlin.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  It's a big club, and we ain't in it.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Well, guess what? My ancestors and your ancestors built this stinking thing.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  I'm always hearing Lewis Farrakhan saying, black people built this country,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  and they certainly were a big part of it, and you better give us a piece of this dirt,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  or we're going to burn this sucker down.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  And before the media takes me out of context and says, I said that,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  I'm quoting Lewis Farrakhan, but I get the point.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  I'm not defending what he said at that point in time.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  What I'm saying is everybody built this thing,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  and the elite are stealing it.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  I want some of this dirt.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I'm not going to roll over to the New World Order.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  I'll say that right now.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  I want the life extension.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  I want the classified technologies that they claim are disruptive technologies
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  so we can't have them.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  Yeah, they're not disruptive for you.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  You're not allowed to hide all this stuff in our national security.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Be tax exempt.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  I want this dirt.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I'm not going to take your vaccines and eat your GMO.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  I know good damn well you're trying to kill us.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  And I'm not going to sit here and fight with a bunch of people.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  I'm sick of it.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Yeah, I got to criticize Beyonce and all these people spewing all their race garbage,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  but she's funded by Sumner Redstone and Fox TV and the Super Bowl.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  That's the establishment's mouth.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  And I see young kids running around acting like her everywhere.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  A lot of them get shot by the police.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  They're literally putting out a program.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  My two girls were so good until one time I bought a CD online of Huey,
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Louis and Dewey, Donald Duck's cousins or nephews.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  And I let them watch them over a couple nights.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And I noticed they started being really bad and doing pranks on each other
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  and misbehaving and it was just seeing five or six of the cute little ducks
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  doing bad things to Donald and I took me months to get my girls to stop.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Now folks, that's the power of little girls seeing cute little ducks
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  running around doing bad things.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  Now you got Beyonce running around saying attack cops,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  burn things down, knock out store windows.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  She's telling you go out and get your head blown off.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  You know why Chicago's got double the homicide rate of the world now?
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Highest rate in the world? Double that?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  They had the highest. Now they double.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Just type in Chicago doubles murder rate in the last year.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  It's gangster rap.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  And most people getting killed are people that watch these videos
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  and then come trying to rob somebody.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  And citizens just don't care and blow you away.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  There it is. WGNTV, homicide rate in Chicago more than double since last February.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  And it was the world's highest crime rate then.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  That's what's living under the parasite rule of the New World Order's life.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  Now, we're making such progressive waves.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  Inclusivity is a core belief that target a new company's statement reads.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  It's something we celebrate.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  We stand for equality and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  We're not even worried about the actual transgendered people.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  It's the pedophiles.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  It's the ones you're going to go in there, put on a dress and go after young girls.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  That is what we're worried about.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  This has got to end. The social justice warrior is ridiculous.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:03.000]  I'm Joe Biggs and I do not approve this message.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]  Forget the politicians.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  They own everything. They own all the important land.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses and city halls.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  They've got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  They got you by the balls.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  until the robots replace you.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  It's the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears in the end of your life.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  Now they're coming with vaccines to kill you.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  They're criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  It's a big planet. You ain't going to be on it.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  And I mentioned that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  That's right.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  George Carlin is with us still battling the New World Order.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  Yeah, George Carlin was the 9-11 trither.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  The median misrepresentation of 9-11 trither is where people that know Saudi Arabia and criminal elements of other governments were involved, including ours.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  Because the FBI and the head of the Department of Transportation, everybody else came out at the time,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  including the Congressional Commission, and said there was a cover-up.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  That was in the news.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  But it was in AP, in Reuters, in a Miami Herald. It wasn't big news.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  And it was in closed sessions of Congress, closed committees.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Now Obama under heat says he'll release part of the 28 pages.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  Well, the 28 pages itself is only a small piece.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Release it all, Obama. It's only a matter of time.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  But we already have talked to Congressman Jones and others that have seen it.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  Our government ordered a stand-down on 9-11 and ordered a subsequent cover-up,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  and ordered cover-ups to let the hijackers go forward in the months before,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  because they were just decoys in a CIA joint Saudi Arabian-Turkish-Israel drill.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  But it really wasn't a drill.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  Nerve gas was released on board the planes, and we don't know what happened after that.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  As best we've researched, but the only real air-phone calls that happened
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  were the flight attendants saying there's gas, we're choking, we can't breathe on two different flights.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  The FBI, to which credit, came out and said there were no 35,000, 30,000-foot flight calls
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  to the Solicitor General from his wife with the official story.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  Our cell phone didn't call him. There was no air-phone call.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  When the Solicitor General went on Lurking Live, it was a load of prunes to quote Dan Rather.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  Just Google for yourself.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  FBI says Solicitor General's wife did not call him phone record show.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  Did not happen, did not happen, did not happen.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  And when they claimed the calls came in, it was 30 minutes for impact,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  when the plane was still at 30 plus thousand feet.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  I have flown 100 plus times since 9-11, probably more.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  In some trips, it's four or five times per flight, per trip, say to Europe or whatever.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  I have always, neurotically, tried to get my cell phone to work above.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  15 years ago, it would conk out of 3,000 feet. The towers have gotten better.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  It goes about six, 7,000 now. You say, how do you know that? How do you know that?
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  I can tell how we are from towers and things. I don't know how tall 2,000 of the towers are
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  even seeing how high you are.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  They admit they don't work at those heights, but that's how dumb they think you are,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  But the good news is, it's coming out. I want to go to your phone calls, Andrew and
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  Jackie and Tom and Santino and Erika, so many others that are patiently holding.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  I will go to your phone calls.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  But just finishing up with this global government, if you just joined us,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Boris Johnson is the liberal mayor, super popular of London.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Lord Monkton, the conservative, former top adviser to Margaret Thatcher,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  frequent guest of the show, if we should get him on soon, about the bricks exit.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  He kept pointing out that 80-plus percent of their laws were made by the EU.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Now it's gotten worse where 90-plus percent are made by the EU.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  And Parliament, whether it's in Ireland or whether it's in England or whether it's in
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  Scotland, has to rubber stamp it. That's their model.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  Unelected boards make the decisions. The elected things just get to rubber stamp,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  kind of like the Republicans are telling us the delegate process works now.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  They've never done this before. They're trying to act like this is normal,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  stealing votes and not honoring popular votes. It's bull.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  Well, it's the same thing. Well, it hasn't worked.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  So, to the credit of the libertarian patriots in the UK Independence Party,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  founded by Nigel Farage and Lord Monkton and others,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  they're now the fastest growing party in Europe and the EU and in the UK.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  And now the left is having to adopt this and go, yeah, we deserve to make our own laws.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  Yes, you're right. Yes, we don't like foreign groups making our laws.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  Because even the left has opposition to the NAU and EU and TPP and all these agreements
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  that just give more power to unelected groups.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  That's what we're going into.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  And if we ever force a debate about this in the general public, it's over.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  And that's what I've hammered forever and we're starting to reach that point.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  People are going, wait a minute, China doesn't have to shut down any coal power plants,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  but we do and they have dirty plants. We have clean ones.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  And that makes our energy two, three times, four times.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  In some cases, what is in China?
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  So factories have to move to China.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  America used to be most competitive because we had a low cost energy plan
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  to dominate the world until the 70s.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  And people go, wait a minute, if you triple our power prices,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  you just, boom, light bulb, light bulb goes on
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  because they're literally trying to turn the light bulbs off.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  You see, wait, a foreign group makes my laws?
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  Wait, the Pope's calling for world government?
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  What, Mexico are rusty legals?
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  But we have to pay for them to have kids here?
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  And they're calling me racist?
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  That's why 70% of Hispanics in Gallup poll want to control the border.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  Even people that aren't citizens want a border.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  They're not stupid.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  You don't have a country if you don't have one.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  But they sit there and go, Donald Trump is evil
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  because he says up is up and down is down.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  Isn't it evil?
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  And then the right gets all concerned.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  When he comes out in North Carolina and goes,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  well, I guess, you know, we should just have one bathroom for everybody.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  And what he's talking about is the new modern bathrooms
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  where they get around this, where there's just single bathrooms.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  You go in a whole hall, has like eight bathrooms at the hotel.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  I personally like that better.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  I don't like much about the modern design
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  with a swing pool or a foot and a half deep.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  You know, the lawyers write all this and no diving boards.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  But you go to the W and stuff, it's like eight or nine bathrooms,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  single person bathrooms.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  Boy, that's what I like.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  I want privacy.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  So the answer is just go to single bathrooms,
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  everywhere in family restrooms, absolutely.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  But see, Trump is cheap.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  He doesn't want to retrofit all his hotels.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  And when he got asked that question, I saw him rise in my chair and he goes,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  yeah, let's just go with use whatever you want.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  He goes, this is going to be really expensive.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Yeah, like Americans with disabilities act, you're bankrupting so much.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  You could even argue, though, that's reasonable,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  that it becomes reasonable when it's on small organizations,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  you know, $100,000 size businesses.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  It just bankrupts them.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  You've always got to accept the little guy.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  Instead, the globalist always get exempted and the little guy doesn't.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  That's the essence of the new world order.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  So here's the Boris Johnson clip where they're attacking him.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  And he goes, how dare you?
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  We'll make our own laws if we want.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  That's sovereignty.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  The idea of nationalism is coming back.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Globalism is a screw job.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  It's not some cool, you know, thing.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  It's really hip, man.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  Some shadow corporation made my laws, dude.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  Enron came up with all this, by the way, the carbon taxes, the TPP.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  And then Bill Nye, the science guy, has the nerve to get up on TV and say,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  yeah, we should look at arresting people that disagree with manmade global warming.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Because we arrested Enron.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Enron came up with it, boy.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  Here is the mayor of London.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  Obviously, people will make of the article what they want.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  But the crucial point is that I'm a big fan of Barack Obama's on the first piece
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  to come out in favor of them ages ago.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  But I think it's a weird paradox when the present United States,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  a country that would never dream of sharing its sovereignty over anything,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  instructs or urges us politely to get more embroiled in the European Union,
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  which is already making 60% of our laws.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  And furthermore, I think it's a bit much when the Americans,
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  with all due respect to our wonderful American diplomats here in London,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  owe this city 9 million pounds in unpaid congestion charge.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And for them to tell us that in every first step...
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  We're going to go to break in it.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  His article is more hardcore, but the point is sovereignty is openly being debated.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  We're about to go to break. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  B-12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B-12,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B-12 injections,
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  No needles, no injections.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  Try it for yourself.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  Discover the secret.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  Secret 12.
