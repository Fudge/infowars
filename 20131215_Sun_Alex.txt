[00:00.000 --> 00:15.320]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:15.320 --> 00:22.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[00:22.000 --> 00:42.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:42.000 --> 01:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this 15th day of December 2013.
[01:10.000 --> 01:24.000]  Oh yes, the year is very old as a big long white beard as we prepare to go out with the old in with the new 2014 ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.000]  And as Matt Drudge said about a year ago on his Twitter feed, 2014 is everything.
[01:31.000 --> 01:48.000]  And I already knew that and had thought about that. But in the last year, I think about that tweet almost every day because I realized that 2014 to a great extent will probably be the most important year in our lifetimes.
[01:48.000 --> 01:58.000]  Not just for this country, but every other nation. All of the dots are connecting. Everything is intersecting in 2014.
[01:58.000 --> 02:11.000]  That doesn't mean things won't be a lot crazier for better and worse after that. But the set of things, the way it's going to go so much of it is 2014.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  Why can it like the Bible does to bringing up a child and then releasing them into the world like drawing an arrow back on your bow and then releasing.
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.000]  And then once you've released, it's out of your hands to a great extent when the child 16, 17, 18 years old. It's the same thing.
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  So much of what we've seen is the pulling back of the arrow and the different forces battling for where that arrow is going to go.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  And now it's up and the forces are all engaged and 2014 is the release of the arrow.
[02:43.000 --> 02:55.000]  That's the best way that I can describe 2014. It is a momentous year and we've seen incredible things happen the last year.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  You notice there's a quickening politically. This happens historically at the bottom of a decadent cycle.
[03:00.000 --> 03:08.000]  You add into that the singularity and high tech changes and the acceleration of knowledge, but also the acceleration of decadence.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  Just all these tidal forces of nature are colliding in together right now.
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I don't want to hear anybody, anybody say that they are bored.
[03:23.000 --> 03:34.000]  Now, obviously we've got a lot of news that I want to cover here, but I went and saw The Hobbit 2, The Desolation of Smog.
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  It was an excellent film, very entertaining, good for kids as well as adults.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Not as good as The First Lord of the Rings, which is one of the best action, adventure, sword and sorcerer films ever.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  But it was definitely excellent. Smog made the movie.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  Peter O'Toole, by the way, died today. We're going to be talking about that great Shakespearean actor.
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  Just watched him about three weeks ago with my children that we watched over my parents' house one night, Lawrence of Arabia.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  Very well done. Accurate historical film to understand the entire Middle East today. You need to watch that movie.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  He died. We're going to talk about that.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  China lands a jade rabbit robot rover on the moon.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  But I saw an ad for a new Matthew McConaughey movie coming out.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  The same guy that popped the last Batman called Interstellar.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  And I went and looked up the secretive synopsis on it.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  But I was sitting there next to Rob Dube, the Rob Dube of my dad and my son and his kids.
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  And I looked at him and said, that's how we should brand what we're doing to get the message across to keep humanity moving forward.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  The intro to the Interstellar trailer. They're not paying me to plug this. I was going to give this tomorrow. I'm going to do it today.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  Guys, go grab the new Interstellar trailer. It just came out yesterday.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  I looked last night online. It just came out yesterday. I saw it in theaters the first day it was out.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  And we're going to play that because it really plays it all on the table.
[04:55.000 --> 05:20.000]  Coming up, it's a big broadcast. I'm Alex Jones.
[05:25.000 --> 05:51.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:51.000 --> 05:58.000]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[05:58.000 --> 06:24.000]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial counterparts.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  The play that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  It is a big idea. A new order.
[06:36.000 --> 07:00.000]  It was almost as if it were a planned impulse to hit just pancake.
[07:00.000 --> 07:10.000]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  The guns will be caged and no one will be able to be armed. We're going to take all of them.
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[07:19.000 --> 07:33.000]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[07:33.000 --> 07:40.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[07:40.000 --> 07:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 15th day of December 2013 on this live Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  We're going to have open phones later in the hour into the second hour.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  Back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  The news websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  You can follow yours truly on Twitter at realalexjones.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  Here to begin, there is so much to go over today.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  Just masses of incredibly important news and we will cover it all.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  But first off, I want to just mention some of the headlines that are up on infowars.com.
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.000]  Media works to keep mass murder shooters' profiles secret.
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.000]  Again, media is working very hard to keep mass shooters' profiles a secret.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  We have put together that just was published minutes ago a breakdown of some of the modern mass shooters
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  detailing the fact that across the board they're Democrats
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  and then they share with that being Satanist or occultist
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.000]  and being on psychotropic drugs and being obsessed with shoot-em-up games.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  You want to profile somebody? It's that.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  Also, we're going to get into the Trans-Pacific Partnership that's bigger than NAFTA and GATT,
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  bigger and more dangerous than Obamacare is what the editor of the New American magazine,
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  William F. Jaspers says, and I agree with him.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.000]  I want to take you now from infowars.com to drudgereport.com.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  I hadn't looked at Drudge in the last couple hours.
[09:23.000 --> 09:25.000]  I'd printed articles off there hours ago.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  I got here about three hours ago.
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  And then I was already deciding what I was going to cover first, what was most important
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  and when I got to the site, lo and behold, Drudge also had separately
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  thought that that was most important and had it as his top story.
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  Obamacare Exchange mistakenly debits bank accounts
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  and if you click on that, that is being reported by major television stations across the country
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  from Seattle to other areas.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  KGW reports of erroneous Washington Health Exchange debits.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to explain something to you.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  If you go back and I don't have the crew of the staff to do this, many of you listen to every show or listen routinely.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  You know, we've done countless reports on this in the last four years, warning you, reading the bill.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  You know, in the last few months, I've told you Obamacare is designed to fail.
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  The site is being used to get your personal data, to debit your bank accounts
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  and to take your tax refund and to garnish your wages.
[10:33.000 --> 10:44.000]  They didn't hire 17,000 new IRS agents in the bill to debit your bank accounts and your wages for nothing.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  And you're like, but Obama promised they wouldn't do that.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  If Obama says, zig, you zag, if Obama says up, you go down.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  If he says left, you go right.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  I don't know how else to explain this to people.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  And folks wonder, you know, how we know all this stuff.
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.000]  I'm obsessed with this, how the world works, not with football, not with how to act cool.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  And I'm not putting you down and that's what you're into.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  You know all about football scores that can impress your buddies watching ESPN together while you get drunk.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  That's not going to make you successful in life.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  If you like to do it a few hours a week, I think that's healthy.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  If you do it more than that, you're mentally ill.
[11:25.000 --> 11:35.000]  And that's why I'm so mad at all this entertainment and Cayenne West and Justin Bebel, Bebel Snap or whatever his name is.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  All these people is because it steals everyone's future.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  We don't look to the stars.
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  We don't admire trailblazers or scientists or researchers or firemen that go into a house and save a kid and get hurt.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  We admire and hold up as a sixth society, gladiators.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  And that's what you do in every culture that's getting ready to collapse.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  Every indicator it's there.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  So that's why I talk about that so much.
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  You know, I saw a report yesterday, Saturday, that had been on the M4 Wars Nightly News that David Knight hosted.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  Weeknight 7 o'clock and I'd missed that TV show.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  I usually get home and watch it.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  Or after it's live at 7, I'll catch it later after the kids go to bed at 9 or 10.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  We restream or you can download it at infowarsnews.com.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  And I didn't watch it Friday, so I watched it yesterday.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  I watched the Nightly News yesterday evening.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  And they came out with a company, Palantir, funded by the CIA, hooked into Google PayPal.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  And it turned out in their internal documents.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  This came out in the Snowden documents.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  And David Knight in a five-minute report breaks it all down.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  There it is, a cover-up of PayPal's NSA involvement.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  And then it goes into the Palantir.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  And what is a Palantir?
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  That's what you call a crystal ball in Lord of the Rings.
[12:47.000 --> 12:55.000]  For at least a decade, I have called the NSA Google system a Palantir.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  I've probably done this 500 times or more.
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.000]  You can find countless videos where I liken the NSA to Mordor to the Eye of Sauron.
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  I told you they would use the Obamacare site to steal your bank accounts.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  It's now begun.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  Now, that's easy to know because I can read the legislation.
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  This, I likened it to a crystal ball Gandalf's talking to Sauronman, the other wizard.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  And he says, you have one of these?
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  These are dangerous.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  He goes, why should we be scared to use them?
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  Because we don't know who else is looking.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  That's the thing, it's two-way.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  But when you use Google or any other Bing, any big Microsoft search engine,
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  when you use that, it's looking back at you.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  And it knows everything you're looking at, everything you're doing.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  But it's tied in to billions of Palantirs around the world.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  You only have access to one Palantir.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  And you can do incredible things with a search engine.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  It is an NSA opt-in, get the mouse to jump on the...
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000] ...mousetrap, get the bear to put his leg in it.
[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  I'm just telling you to be aware of this.
[14:05.000 --> 14:11.000]  And then it comes out that it gets leaked, that they call it Prism and Palantir,
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  and liken it to a crystal ball that they're looking at you through,
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.000]  and basically likening themselves to Sauron.
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  I mean, I can look at what they're doing, it's Sauron-like.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  I call them Sauron for more than 10 years.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  Then we get documents, they're calling it the exact name of what I call it.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  And I don't know if the chicken or the egg came first.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  The point is, folks, I make mistakes in things, because I'm doing so much,
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  nobody can get all this stuff perfect.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  But at a deep level, I know what I'm talking about.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  At a deep, deep, deep level.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  And I'm not bragging here.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  I'm just saying, I know this stuff is shocking that we discuss here.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  But I've got the Palantir that God gave me.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  I don't need a Google system, even though I do use it.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  But I realize, with great danger,
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  I can see historically and currently and in the future, politically,
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  don't need a magic carpet, don't need a magic wand.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  I've got the electrochemical computer God gave me.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  Anybody, though, could see we're going into hardcore tyranny.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  I saw the head of PayPal in that same report,
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  but I want to cue this up later, going,
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  on Charlie Rose, you should just trust the government
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  and do whatever they say, like it was Britney Spears.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  Remember when she said, just do whatever the president tells you,
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  and submit, that's the way of freedom.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  They say the same thing.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  Then they've got Meet the Press or one of those shows on with Hayden
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  re-airing clips of it when I was in the coffee room earlier,
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  and he's going, just trust us, be adult about this,
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  and let us file everything you're doing.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  See, they've gone from, we promised we're not spying onto you.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  Oh, you caught us.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  Just be adult.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  It's for your own safety when we know they're predatory.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  It's amazing.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  All the big news coming up straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  That I personally use, you've got the life straw,
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you go.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  The K-Tour Hand Crank Generator,
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  to charge up key equipment during power outages
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  or out in the field.
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  Strategic Relocation Third Edition by Joel Scousum.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein,

[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  with new aqua medics advanced media
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals,
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  all in one filter element.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  The most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[17:59.000 --> 18:00.000]  The facts are in.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  The studies are legion.
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  To assemble dumb down the host population
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet,
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.000]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  Infowars Live fluoride shield formulation,
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  from around the world to help the body remove
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  I stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  I use fluoride shield every day.

[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Alex Jones here,
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  and I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show,
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  my patriot supply.
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  As you might remember,
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  this is the company that stood up to the DHS
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  and exposed FEMA's secret plan
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  It has always been my belief that it's key
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  to stand behind companies
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  who share the same values as their fellow patriots.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  My patriot supply brings us their exclusive
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Patriot Pantry brand,
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  along with many other fine preparedness products.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  I personally store and use their high quality products.

[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  It is essential to prepare
[19:54.000 --> 20:09.000]  with my patriot supply today.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  Well, so does he.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  Live Sunday Worldwide Transmission, the 15th.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  Hard to believe 2014 is about to be here.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  You blink more than once.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  2013 will be gone.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  All right, I have masses of budget news,
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  world news, gun news, military news,
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  Hope Francis news, it goes on and on.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  But you have to understand,
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  a lot of people are saying,
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  how can the government pass a health care bill
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  written mainly by foreign banks
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  than on foreign offshore insurance companies
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  to double, triple, quadruple premiums,
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  lower quality of care,
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  take the control from patients and doctors,
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  set up death panels.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  It's all admitted to be accurate now.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  And then we just blame Obama for it,
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  but he stays in office,
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  and then the bill stays in place,
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  and Republican leaders like Boner and others,
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  John Boehner, do not want to reverse it.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  Because the same special interests that
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  finance them finance the Democratic leadership.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  You've got the Republican Democratic leadership
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  coming after the real organic grassroots tea party,
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  trying to destroy them,
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  and saying, oh, they're discredited, they're bad,
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  but they're blocking progress.
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  While George Herbert Walker Bush's grandson,
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  I'm going to cover this later,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  in Texas, running for state government,
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  land commissioner, George P. Bush says
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  he's a Ted Cruz tea party person
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  and doesn't like the new world order.
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  Isn't that just special?
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  Do you believe any of that?
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  The point here is that we are
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  the opposition to this takeover.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  The real libertarian constitutionalist,
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  we are the majority of thinking people.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  And that's why Republican and Democratic leadership
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  want to bring in another 30 million legal aliens,
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  give them driver's licenses,
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  give them government welfare,
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  and say your job is to vote how we say
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  if you want a free ride.
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  That's the social engineering plan,
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  and if they get that, it's game over.
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  But frankly, if we could get 30 million illegals in here,
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  give them to be patriots and own guns
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  and promote free market, I'd say do it.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  We need more workers in this country to compete.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  The problem is it's a death sentence to this nation.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  If they basically follow a socialist collective
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  of ideology, and almost all the illegals do,
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  because they get a free paycheck.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  They go out and work, by the way, 15 hours a day.
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  They just get under another name, another paycheck.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  That's on record.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  The government set it up that way.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  And if they get this, folks, it's game over.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  They will collectivize this country
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  and the offshore corporations that run at the corporatist.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Lou Rockwell has an article out today explaining that.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  So the Slate magazines, here it is.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  2016 looks disturbingly good for the corporate estate
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  with Hillary and Chris Christie,
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  who are identical in policies.
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  Just one looks like Job of the Hut,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  the other the Wicked Witch of the West, rear end.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  And the issue here is folks are either going to figure out
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  what's going on in this society
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  and stop letting the establishment
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  lead us around by the nose, or it's over.
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  Now, getting back to this Rubicon point,
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  crossing this threshold,
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  that's how tyranny works.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  Like a parent, before it steps on a branch,
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  will test the perch.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  They're testing if we'll put up with them taking our guns.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  They're testing on MSNBC nudging,
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  hey, your kids belong to the state.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  They're testing setting up highway checkpoints
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  and TSA infesting the airports with all this security theater,
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  while Al Qaeda's run by our government in Syria
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  and Libya worldwide,
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  and they're giving them control of the whole world, basically.
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  In Africa, I mean, it's just incredible.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  And if they can get away with all the exchanges screwed up,
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  100 million people tried to sign up but couldn't,
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  but we got your data and we found out
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  who doesn't have insurance, that 50-something million,
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  and now we know who to go after your wages that you don't have it.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  They were identifying you.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  They knew what it was meant to do,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  and then wrecked the old healthcare system,
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  and the architect of it,
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Rahm Emanuel's brother, Dr. Ezekiel,
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  we played that clip probably 30 times,
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  I'm not going to play it again,
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  said on Fox News Sunday two months ago
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  that it's meant to wreck the healthcare system.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  Exactly what we told you.
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  They've done this in other countries over and over again.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  It's like I have a Tivo,
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  and I'm rewinding the Monday night football from last week,
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  and I've already seen it in the play five times,
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  and I'm telling you what's going to happen.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  They're like, oh yeah, right, conspiracy theorist.
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  They do the same thing in country after country.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  It's like instant replay.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  I mean, this is not my opinion, folks.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  You can differ on my interpretation of the data,
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  but man, it is naked.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  It's not hidden.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  Big corporate interests like direct countries
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  that consolidate power, they're not free market,
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  and they're the enemy of real free market
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  and the enemy of prosperity,
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.000]  and man, if we don't get that, folks, we're done.
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  We are done, done, done, done.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  And by the way, I was told this,
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  and it was even sent copies weeks ago,
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  but it was so bombshell.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  I said on air, I guarantee you,
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  they're already taking people's bank accounts.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  We were already getting listeners sending us stuff
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  and saying, and the bank tells them it's a mistake,
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  and oh, you'll get it back, but then they don't.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  So I'm going to go ahead down, go back over all those emails
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  we've gotten the last couple of weeks,
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  and now I'll authorize Curtin MO,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Adon Salazar,
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  and all the rest of our writers,
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  Mikhail Thalen, Anthony Gucciardi, Kit Daniels.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  I will now authorize them to go ahead and go with that.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.000]  It's just that we weren't sure if it was mistakes or not,
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  but now it's clearly not mistakes.
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  They're doing it all over the country,
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  and we predicted they would.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  I mean, here it is out of KGW.com, mainstream news.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  Washington State.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  This is what they do, folks,
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  and people are now having telemarketers call them
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  all over the country that have been on this,
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  and people are now getting swindled, of course.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  Of course, because it's a test.
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  They can say, oh, it's broken, but keep signing up,
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  and then they can have, you know, the Maroon 5
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  or whatever that idiot's group is,
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  you know, have that guy come out the sexiest trendy,
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  according to trendy publications,
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  and say, I'm for Obamacare,
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  so all the idiots go and try to sign up.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.000]  I mean, this is really a joke, folks.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  This is all part of exploiting people.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  It's like Cayenne West comes out with a $130 shirt
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  that costs $3 from Haynes and says,
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  I'm going to show what idiots my people are and my power.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  They're going to pay $130 for it, and they go out and buy it.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  I mean, it's all about betraying you.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  It's all about screwing you.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  It's all about making a joke and pimping you and gaming you
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  and jacking you up.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  $800 in the negative.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  The first thing I thought was they, I got screwed.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  Last October, the Bruners enrolled for insurance
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  on the Washington Health Planfinder website.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  They say they selected the bill paid date to be December 24th,
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  but instead, the Health Planfinder drafted
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  the $835 premium today.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  You know, big knot in my gut because, you know...
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  By the way, folks, it's happening,
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  it's happening through the Obamacare system as well.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  We're going to have that out tomorrow.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  But the point here is that they're seeing
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  what you'll put up with right now.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  And if you act like sheep and roll over and act powerless
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  and don't take action in different ways,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  speaking out against it, filing lawsuits,
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  whatever the case is, demanding states,
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  nullify it, demand Congress repeal it.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.000]  I mean, you'd think this is the most unpopular bill
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  and unpopular law in the last 100 years.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  No one denies that.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  It's down to less than 10% support.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  This has a 6% approval rating.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  And they won't repeal it.
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  They're walking all over us.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  Well, our boots are made for walking on them.
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  We're going to come back and get to the Newtown anniversary
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  and the fear-mongering and demonization
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  of the Second Amendment,
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  and the real profile of these mass shooters
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  that the establishment state-run media
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  does not want you to know.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  The article's up on infowars.com and prisonblended.com.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  Right now, media works to keep mass shooters' profiles secret.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[30:59.000 --> 31:02.000]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[31:02.000 --> 31:07.000]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  The globalist model is to shut down societies
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[31:14.000 --> 31:18.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  Fluoride. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[32:17.000 --> 32:21.000]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  and the results are on record.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  Bottom line iodine is important.
[32:34.000 --> 32:37.000]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base,
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.000]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[33:00.000 --> 33:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  I am a human being.
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  and no dimension, like air, like the wind.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  I don't care. I tell you, I don't care.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  I'm a human being. I exist.
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives,
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  even after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth,
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  delusions that you inject into your veins
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  to make you think you have a strength
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  when you have no strength at all.
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream
[34:09.000 --> 34:33.000]  and the state has no use for your crime.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  What is humanity's ultimate destiny?
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  That's up to us individually.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  Because our individual actions and dreams
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  will lead the future course of this species.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  The globalists want to seize control
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  of that individual North Star with propaganda
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  and direct humanity.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  And the direction they want to direct us
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  is towards being dumbed down,
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  biological servants, biological androids.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  I'm here calling for the robot zombie rebellion.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  So the humanity actually acts like we were built
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  in the image of our creator
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  and not in the image as the fallen New World Order would have us.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  All right, let me get into all this news
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  because I want to have open phones
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  coming up in the second hour today.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  The top story up on infowords.com
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  has the headline,
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.000]  Media Works to Keep Mass Shooter Profiles Secret.
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  Democratic socialists and occultists
[35:31.000 --> 35:38.000]  make up majority of mass shooters.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Now before I get into that article
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  and give you some of the background in the history,
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  here's the Washington Post from yesterday.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  Obama marks Newtown anniversary
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  with call for action on gun control.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  And of course that was on Friday
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  that they marked the anniversary of the tragic event.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  But statistically they didn't mark
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  300 plus people killed last year
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  from Wasp in the U.S.,
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  200 plus from Honeybees.
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  They didn't dramatize that and create all the fear.
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  No, they did it with Newtown and said,
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  come on, ban your guns, turn your guns in,
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  you're guilty gun owners
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  for not turning your guns in.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  It's your fault collectively.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  Meanwhile, our government is funding Al Qaeda
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  You're like, we're fighting them in Afghanistan.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  They're also funding them.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  You've got to have an excuse to be there.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  They're funding them in Egypt,
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  giving them weapons, giving them tow missiles,
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.000]  anti-tank missiles,
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  giving them service-to-air missiles
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  to shoot down airliners if they choose.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  It's okay to give known Al Qaeda
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  with Al Nuzra Al Qaeda flags,
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  service-to-air missiles that blow up helicopters
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  and pass your jetliners,
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  but you can't have a gun,
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  even though the FBI's own numbers,
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  from 1992 to 2002,
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  and then right through through 2011,
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  the latest numbers we have,
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.000]  shows a 61% overall gun crime drop.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  Injuries are down 51%
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  from firearms and firearm-related crimes.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  Look it up.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  Those numbers all came out this year.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  They always come out a couple years late.
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  People say, well,
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  you're plugging the FBI,
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  but the FBI is corrupt.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  No elements of it are corrupt.
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  Modern statistics are based on J. Edgar Hoover,
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  who was a statistician back in the 20s
[37:33.000 --> 37:34.000]  who created the FBI,
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  and they get local numbers
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  that aren't perfect,
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  but are as good as they get.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  And by the way,
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  since 2007 to 2011,
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  the drop that's been going on since 1992
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  accelerated.
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  Don't believe me.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  And gun crime drops,
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  but public thinks there's more gun crime.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  You'll get LA Times.
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.000]  I forget the exact headline,
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  but it's like as gun crime drops,
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  perception is crime is up,
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  or gun crime is up.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  But that's because the media
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  is brainwashing people.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  I mean, every cop show I see,
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  every drama, every show,
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  the cops find some child molester
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  or drug dealer or horrible person,
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  and then, oh, they have a gun.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  They go to jail for that.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.000]  Well, yeah, because they have a gun
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  and the commission of a crime,
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  not because they have a gun,
[38:26.000 --> 38:27.000]  but ooh, you got a gun,
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  you're going down.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  People see that and believe guns are illegal.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  There's the LA Times.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Gun crime is plunged,
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  but Americans think it's up,
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  says study, May 2013, May 7th.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  Boom.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  See, I got the headline almost exactly right.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  51% drop in guns and the commission of crimes
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  where there's injuries.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  60 plus percent in overall gun crime being down.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  But you'd watch the news, folks,
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  and you'd think there were gun owners
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  swinging from chandeliers,
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  killing everyone.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  The truth is the mass shooters all pick
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  victim disarmament zones,
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  federal buildings, military bases,
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  where they don't have troops,
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  have guns, they don't trust them.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  Public schools, disarmed colleges,
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  airports, this is where
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  in literally 90 plus percent of the cases,
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  they are Democrat socialist devil worshipers
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  who are also into video games,
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  shoot them up games and on drugs.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  Not a good mix.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  If I lived next to devil worshipers
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  and they told me they were devil worshipers
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  and were strutting in another house with guns,
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  I would move.
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  I would move.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  I've had bad neighbors before,
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  not like that,
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  but I've had bad neighbors before.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  I didn't even have a cat
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  and this woman would come over.
[39:44.000 --> 39:45.000]  I lived over in South Austin.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  She'd say,
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  your cat is going to the bathroom in my flower bed
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  and I'm going to basically call CPS on you,
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  on your kids, if you don't clean it up.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  And I'd say, call CPS.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  What's the deal with the cat?
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Just watch your butt, buddy.
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  And I submitted to her.
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.000]  I said, it's not mine,
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  but I'm going to submit to you.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  This is a smart way.
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  No one to hold them, no one to fold them.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  I would go and remove it when I put the first cell sign up.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  Didn't have a cat and would just look at this
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  old demonic woman who told me,
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  I hate your show.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  I hate you, kind of socialist.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  And I took the high road because I couldn't move out.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  I didn't want to deal with the false charges.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  She wanted petty power.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  And usually I'll fight back against anybody,
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  but sometimes you have to learn to submit.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  And I would go and wash her feet, basically.
[40:25.000 --> 40:26.000]  Christ's like, clean up,
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  I don't know, probably 10 times.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  She'd come over and tell my wife,
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  come clean up your cat's crap.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  She'd go, we don't have a cat.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  You liar, you liar.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  You know all those mentally ill people.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  That's why I now live on nine acres
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  and talk to no one.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  They want to get rid of that.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  They want to have me right next to people in cookie cutters,
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  next to all the screwed up scum they've created.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  Side issue, excuse me.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  Now that's true story, by the way.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  That's true story I just told you.
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.000]  This creepy woman, man,
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  and her state employee husband,
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  they were like 75,
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  but he still worked for the state.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  And I mean, boy, they said,
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  you're the Alex Jones on TV and radio.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  And they just started making crap up.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  We lived there about a year before they figured out who I was.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  And boy, when that happened, living hell began.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  They were going to make me the bad man.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  They were going to demonize me.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  They were going to, I looked to the fence
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  and see them looking at me.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  But I'd be in the backyard playing with my kids.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  Total creep bags.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  And of course they were state employees.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  But side issue, let me get back into this stuff
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  I was talking about here with you.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  I'm not saying all state employees are bad.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  A lot of them are listeners.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  You know what I'm talking about.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  The point is they were state employees.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  He was retired, he wasn't.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  He was with the highway department.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  They might be listening if they're not dead yet.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  That was about six, seven years ago.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  That makes his remarks.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  And then here it is, ladies and gentlemen,
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  we have the article right here.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  Media works to keep mass shooters' profiles secret.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  An undeniable pattern has continued to emerge
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  in light of mass shootings, despite the media's attempt
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  to avoid connecting the dots.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  In the wake of recent high-profile shootings,
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  the media can almost immediately be seen attempting
[42:00.000 --> 42:03.000]  to link deranged shooters with political right.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  As facts come in, the desire to connect shooters
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  with ideologies quickly erodes as the same antidepressant,
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  talking, left-wing, occultist profile emerges.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  The 2011 Arizona shooter,
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  registered Democrat, devil worshipper with a satanic shrine,
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  in his backyard, on psychotropic drugs.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  Boom.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  Dressed like the grim raper.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  And I'm not knocking Goths,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  because most Goths are nice people.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  But I mean, it is a subgroup of Goths
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  that are into this.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  There are one of them is a Goth.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  Harris, Clybold, Kip Kinkle, Adam Lanza.
[42:40.000 --> 42:44.000]  I mean, it's just about 90% of the time they're a Goth.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Despite initial reports attempting to paint
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  the same picture, information now shows
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  that last week's shooter in Colorado, Carl Halverson,
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  was a devoted Democrat socialist.
[42:55.000 --> 43:05.000]  We'll tell you the rest when we come back.
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.000]  We'll tell you the rest when we come back.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  Great tasting cup of my favorite coffee,
[43:57.000 --> 44:26.000]  available at inflowarslife.com.
[44:27.000 --> 44:53.000]  We'll tell you the rest when we come back.
[44:57.000 --> 45:00.000]  That's inflowarslife.com.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  At that time, we talk about natural disasters.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  The health environment, we talk about pollution,
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  the water quality.
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states,
[45:36.000 --> 45:37.000]  most people won't even be ready,
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  won't be able to get out of town,
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  because there'll be absolute panic.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[45:46.000 --> 45:51.000]  Strategic relocation film with Joel Scalzen and Alex Jones.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Available only at inflowarslife.com.
[45:55.000 --> 46:00.000]  We'll be calling 888-253-3139.
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  about a long time friend of the show,
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  My Patriot Supply.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  As you might remember, this is the company
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  that stood up to the DHS
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  and exposed FEMA's secret plan
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  It has always been my belief that it's key
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  to stand behind companies
[46:19.000 --> 46:22.000]  who share the same values as their fellow patriots.
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  Patriot Pantry brand,
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  along with many other fine preparedness products.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  for up to 25 years.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  on a four-week supply of food,
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  along with other special offers.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  Visit mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex today,
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.000]  with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  It is essential to prepare with my Patriot Supply today.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  We're opening the phones up in the next hour.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  I'd love to hear from you first-time callers yet again
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  on any subject you want to discuss.
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  As long as you've got a good telephone,
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  we're not going to screen your call
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  as long as it sounds bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  and crackly.
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  No, I'm joking.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  If you disagree with me and love Jeremy,
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  you're welcome to the front of the line as well.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  877-789-2539.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  We have a lot of original, amazing callers.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  We have a lot of really idiot callers.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  You sound like you're drinking cough syrup.
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  We have a lot of in-between callers
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  because we don't screen your calls.
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  So again, that number, 877-789-2539.
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.000]  Now, some days I say,
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  I want to hear from firefighters on this subject
[48:04.000 --> 48:05.000]  or active duty,
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  or I want to hear from doctors on Obamacare,
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  nurses, or I want to hear from the visually impaired
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  about a piece of legislation.
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  Then we screen calls by topic.
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  But other times, I'd say 95% of the time,
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  we don't screen your calls.
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  So I want to hear from you coming up in the next hour.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  So you've got 50% plus drop in guns being used in crimes violently.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  You've got 60% plus drop in guns being used in crime, period.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  We showed those numbers.
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  If you're a radio listener,
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  you can watch it at infowars.com
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  or its last show, actually see the feed
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and see all the graphs and documents we're showing you.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  And then, meanwhile, I saw an article by Kurt Nemo,
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  and then I followed it over to the Denver Post,
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  and then I learned that they later removed it
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  out of their article, and the police removed it.
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  Colorado shooter, opinionated socialist, and Keynesian,
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  I mean, centralized economic planner
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  who claims they're free market but isn't,
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  where the government basically controls the economy.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  But don't expect Mark Potock at MSNBC
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  to talk about how yet another quote,
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.000]  devout socialist, democratic, liberal
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  who didn't like people debating with him.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  It turns out this is out today.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  Conservatives on the speech team,
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  he wanted to shoot the conservatives.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  We've now confirmed there were conservatives on the team.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  I did this right before the show.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  I should have called Watson or Thalen or Nemo
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.000]  or somebody that's working on the weekend.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  Because I just forgot, even before the show,
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  it actually showed the teacher and the librarian
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  and the students he wanted to go after.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  And I went and looked and searched their names.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  This is breaking for media out there.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  And guess what?
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  They were Republicans and libertarians.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  So a devoted socialist Democrat
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  wanted to shotgun Republicans and libertarians.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  Now, by the time MSNBC's done,
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  they'll say an Alex Jones listener,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  that's what they usually say, literally, if you've heard them,
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  you know, tried to kill precious, God-like Democrats.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  And again, I'm not even a Democrat or Republican.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  But the Republicans at least paid lip service to the Republic.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Democrats openly want to get rid of it.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  So I forgot that little tidbit in research.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  He was going to kill people for their speech.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  And of course, you know what a communist is,
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  a socialist that's willing to pick up an AK-47
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  and go after their political enemies.
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  That's all they are.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  That's what it always turns into.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  So the real story is Democratic socialists
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  wanted to kill people for their speech.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  Wow, there's the headline.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  Because it says he was mad about a disagreement
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  with people in speech class.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  And then I went and looked up who he wanted to kill.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  Too bad he only got to fire shotgun pellets into him
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  like a good commie.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.000]  He didn't know he should have had slugs or double-locked buck.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Thank God these people can't shoot straight.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  And he wanted to go kill conservatives.
[50:58.000 --> 50:59.000]  The picture is emerging.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  That's the problem as a newshound.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Obsessed with this seven days a week,
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  literally every waking moment.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  I could be bouncing one of my daughters on my knee
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  when they were little.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  I'd be sitting there reading an article.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  I can't help it.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  You're either in the game or you're not.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  And I just remembered that, oh, I discovered
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  by off the names of who he wanted to kill
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  that there are Republicans and libertarians.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  And then it says he wanted to kill the people
[51:23.000 --> 51:24.000]  that disagreed with him.
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.000]  He's a Democrat socialist.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  He wants to kill them.
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  You think that's newsworthy?
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  Democrats are now trying to kill people they disagree with.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  And he probably thought, oh, good.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  I'll use a gun.
[51:36.000 --> 51:37.000]  They'll take guns while I'm at it.
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.000]  That's how I win the debate.
[51:38.000 --> 51:39.000]  I'll just do this.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  I mean, this is what I'm talking about.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  This is why, in fact, I got to call my writers right now.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  Folks, I know it's plugged in out there.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  Bring me my phone.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.000]  I got to call Watson.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  I know it's like 12 o'clock at night over in England
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.000]  or 11 o'clock at night.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  Or I got to call Gucci Artie.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  Or I got to call Mikhail Thelon.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  Or I got to call Kurt Nemo.
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  Because literally this is international news.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  Oh, wait, Kit Daniels is here.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  Kit, listen.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  I went and searched the name of the librarian
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.000]  and the name of the people.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  You can go find the speech team.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  And I did it right before Aaron
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  and then got distracted with other stuff
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  and some management stuff I was doing here
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  about the launch of the new TV show and stuff.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  And I forgot because I was meeting with dude.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  If you go search the debate team at that school
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  and the name of the librarian and the teacher in them,
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  I found the folks on there,
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  as they were having socialist versus conservative debates,
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  it says in the article,
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  in fact, let me give you the article right here.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  You find it right here.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  That, where is it?
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  That he wanted to,
[52:33.000 --> 52:34.000]  it's the picture with the young woman.
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  Here it is.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  This is out of a Wall Street Journal.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  That he wanted to go after them
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  because of the speech debate.
[52:41.000 --> 52:42.000]  We've got them.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  This is literally hardcore commies
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  trying to kill people they disagree with.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  And that's the revolutionary struggle.
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  That's what they're going to do as soon as they get our guns.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  The cowards can take us out one by one.
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  So here it is.
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  A Walmart employee arrested for shooting co-workers' car
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  over awards.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  See, it's all about getting,
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  that's why we need our guns
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  is to protect ourselves from these scumbags.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  So listen, here's the stack of articles.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  I know you've been working already all day.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  When did you come in?
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  Why are you here?
[53:12.000 --> 53:13.000]  Oh, good job.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  Listen, I don't want to give you this assignment
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  because you already worked five days this week.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  I know you're on a commie. You like to work.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  Do you want to do this or should I call somebody else?
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  You want to look into it?
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  I mean, you could just go with the headline,
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  you know, Democrat targeted conservative,
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  conservatives on speech team,
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  you disagree with something like that.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  I'm telling you, I found it.
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  I went and found it.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  And then he said he wanted to go after people on the speech team.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  So here it is.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  It's pretty big.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  But listen, there's no pressure.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  I will literally call one of the other guys that wants to do it.
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  You want to do it?
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  Oh, you're working on a magazine article.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  What's the magazine article about Obama being a dictator?
[53:54.000 --> 53:55.000]  Yeah.
[53:55.000 --> 53:56.000]  All right.
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  Well, don't worry about it then.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  You want, you know what?
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  I'll take care of it.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  We'll just think about it and we'll see what happens.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  Doesn't matter.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  A lot of media is listening already.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  All I care about is the story gets out.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  Thank you very much.
[54:05.000 --> 54:06.000]  All right.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  I've forgotten about that.
[54:08.000 --> 54:09.000]  A lot of times I'll think of something
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  and then when I get back to the stack later or after the show,
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  I get so mad because I've got all these stacks document can please
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  from the high shot for TV viewers.
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 stacks of news here.
[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  And I've covered two stacks of 16.
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  And if you want to know why I'm so angry and wound up,
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  ladies and gentlemen, I do all this research and then I get in here
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  and I'm pretty angry.
[54:35.000 --> 54:40.000]  You know, I'm pretty angry that four hours ago I was reading
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  that this person was a Democrat that wanted to kill the conservatives
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  on the debate team and that's buried in the news article
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  and it should be international headlines.
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.000]  Meanwhile, gun owners, you and I, the bedrock of this country,
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  one of the few countries where people haven't been disarmed,
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  we're being blamed for another school shooting.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  And it's not like it's just this one dirtbag.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  Almost every time, whether it's Son of Sam or Kip Kinkle
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  or Harrison Clybold, five miles from this latest shooting
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  or Adam Lanza, it's devil worshiping goths on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  that play shoot-em-up games that love the Democratic Party
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  when they're not out at their satanic coven.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  And I mean, listen, can I have guns to protect myself
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  from the devil worshipers, from the socialists, from the commies?
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.000]  I mean, the commies killed over 200 million people in the last century.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  The fascist only killed like 50 million.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  The 260 plus million, the University of Hawaii
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  put out a democide report two years ago.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  Of the 260 plus non-military combatants killed men, women, and children,
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.000]  you name it, by government, 206 million.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  Million. We're killed by commies.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  Communists are the enemy. Communists are the problem.
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  Communists are the issue. And I'm sick of them.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  I'm sick of them. I'm tired of them.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  And you're not going to get my guns, you trash.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  Get that through your walnut brain.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  I am sick of it. I'm a liberal like Thomas Jefferson.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  I want property rights, family rights, gun rights, religious rights.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  You can do whatever you want as long as it hurts somebody else.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  I want drugs decriminalized.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  If you want to come here on a worker visa and you've got skills like Switzerland,
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  you don't have skills and you want to come vote to take my guns,
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  go straight to hell. That's what I'm for.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  I'm for free association and freedom and not being a slave.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  And government takes one way or another 60 plus percent of what I make,
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  state, federal, local, and I think I'm paying enough.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  I think 60 something percent's enough.
[56:53.000 --> 56:59.000]  We don't need 100 percent taxation like France has got to abolish the middle class.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Man, I just got wound up.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  Coming up, we've got my review of Interstellar.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  Long before it comes out, I think we might take Interstellar travel.
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.000]  Because I saw the trailer and it evokes the archetype of everything I stand for.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  And then we're going to get into a new drug that's basically a methamphetamine
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  they're trying to push on workers in America.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  We've got a bunch of other news on the war, the economy,
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  obozo care, or rape care.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  It's all up on infowars.com.

[57:34.000 --> 57:35.000]  You can say no.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  Don't bend over.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  Don't lay down.
[57:37.000 --> 57:38.000]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  What will a nation of patriots be ruled by?
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  Liberty and justice.

[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:33.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. You know who is seen as the greatest political
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.000]  leader in the world right now? It's Pope Francis. Do you know who's seen as number three? Ted Cruz.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.440]  That shows how powerful the Tea Party ideology is against the solid wall of Marxist, Leninist BS
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.560]  funded by big mega banks who want to bankrupt everybody and make us dependent. Now I've got
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.600]  an amazing video that I was going to air Friday that we never got to that's coming up and we've
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:06.280]  also got the New Vigil, New Vigil ad that I was just mentioning and then we've got
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.080]  Interstellar that I want to talk about coming up on the air part of that trailer here,
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.920]  Matthew McConaughey's new film coming out. I've got the IMDB over here and then we'll
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.400]  just take nothing but calls for the balance of the transmission. But right now, speaking of calls,
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:26.600]  let's go ahead and go to your calls. Noelle. I don't know, Noelle is kind of a Christmas term.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.320]  Maybe that should be banned as offensive or banning nativity scenes all over the country right now
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:38.680]  and threatening to arrest people who won't bake gay and lesbian birthday cakes. And again,
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.960]  I'm not against gay and lesbian people, but I think folks should be allowed to not bake them
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.320]  birthday cakes if they want to. Sorry, Noelle. I didn't mean to add all these non sequiturs to
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:54.040]  the start of your talk. Go ahead. Absolutely, Alex. And for just the purposes of this broadcast,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.000]  let's just say bleep. So we don't get in trouble or we don't get the show shut down.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.360]  Exactly. So we're talking to bleep from Chicago right now.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.600]  Yeah, Alex. So listen, I'm a first time caller. I've been listening to the show a couple of years.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:17.400]  I subscribed in Four Wars, Prison Planet TV, I mean, and you know, I've heard several other
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.280]  broadcasts recently and I've just been paying so much more attention to things that are going on
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.320]  in the world. And I just first, I want to thank you. You are actually one of the people that
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:33.080]  that got me to wake up and started understanding some of the things that, you know, this society
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:39.000]  hides from us and some of the things we've been living under, you know, 10 years, 10 more than
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:49.080]  10 years ago, around 2001, I first heard you on your broadcast over 911. And I, to be honest,
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:55.400]  thought you were a racist liar. And why would I be a racist liar if I said that
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.480]  criminal elements of the government stage 9-11? Just because the media says,
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.800]  anybody that disagrees with the government story is a racist.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.280]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. No, I understand that. I'm talking about back then.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.320]  No, no, no, I mean, I'm asking back then, why did you think that?
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:20.360]  Well, I was in 2001, you know, I was pretty much just out of high school. I graduated 99,
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:26.360]  very young. All I remember definitely was just seeing all of the propaganda on TV,
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:32.840]  always about things and, you know, the outrage in which you presented the information back then
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:38.680]  to me just made it seem like, hey, this guy just, this is just another nut. These guys are coming
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.120]  up with these things that the government's out to hurt us. And, you know, that illegals are bad
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.280]  and all these other things. And to me, that's what it seemed at that point, Alex.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:53.160]  No, I understand. And, you know, it's sad because all these other countries are collapsing.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.560]  You want to help people. It's that they're being used. And so that's what's so frustrating.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:05.480]  Yeah. But now we can really see where it's going. And we know the master plan.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:10.200]  And the good news is, I mean, I'll be honest, let's talk about Mexico. Mexico is such a beautiful,
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.560]  such a rich country, culturally, economically. That's the kind of place I'd like to retire
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.520]  as in Mexico. It's not that I want to block the borders to keep brown people from being up here.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:25.960]  I like everybody. I love everything from Mexico, basically. I like the people, like the food.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.800]  I don't like the corrupt government. And I don't like our government using all of that to take
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.960]  my liberty. So God bless you. Good to hear from you. Great points. No L. JT Coyote or Coyote,
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.040]  depending on how you pronounce it. I guess that's racist against dogs. And we're going to talk to
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:50.920]  you, buddy. Caroline, Andrew, Dr. V, Marilyn, Chris, Steve, John, and many others. Your calls
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:05:18.360]  are coming up. But first, my review of interstellar. The trailers right ahead. Stay with us. We may
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.920]  not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:28.440]  our bodies. I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive Info Wars Life fluoride shield
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:34.200]  formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.960]  body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.440]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:50.040]  I use fluoride shield every day. Secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.880]  at infowarslife.com today. Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the info war at the
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:15.640]  same time. That's infowarslife.com.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:31.720]  Hippler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mal took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:57.480]  You know Chavez took the guns. 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:06.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:13.080]  All right your phone calls are coming up as promised. You know I told you weeks ago that that
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:21.320]  whole PR push by the Bilderberg group member Charlie Rose and CBS 60 Manage was to promote the word
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:29.240]  Amazon during the Christmas season for sales. Those drones are not feasible but robot cars,
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:36.120]  robot 18 wheelers, robots replacing humans at factories, it's already begun completely in some
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:45.640]  factories in China. The Financial Times reports Google's racing robots gives Amazon drones a
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:52.840]  run for their money and admits that Google just bought four major global robot companies this week
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.320]  including Boston Dynamics. So talk about Rise of Skynet. That's it. We're going to be breaking it down
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:09.720]  and the reason I cover that first is this. I'm all for progress. I'm all for technology but
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:17.240]  technology is neutral at least until it becomes artificially aware, cognizant and independent.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.520]  There's a debate whether that's possible or not. I believe it's possible upon a fashion.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:28.760]  At least it will be autonomous. We already have drones that are autonomous like the tyrannous
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.400]  that the British government has but that means the Gaelic tyrannous not our tyrannous. Of course
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:41.560]  they named it tyrannous for a reason. It's a double meaning not terrible but I think blessed by God
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:48.120]  I think is what it means in the Gaelic or chosen by God and they're coming out with all of these
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:55.400]  systems so the elite don't need human soldiers that can refuse orders. It's simply program machines
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.440]  that will follow their orders and if you read what Ray Kerr as well the head of Google technology
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:06.520]  development and futurism says if you read what all the ruling elite believe they have basically said
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.160]  they're done with humanity. Humanity is ugly, stunted and over. They're going to basically set
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.200]  up a police state have an organized depopulation reduction of the scourge that is humanity in
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:21.800]  their words and then they will merge with the machines become gods and blast off to alphas
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.080]  and turrets. That's why they've ended the human space program that you know of the public one.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.480]  That's why they're getting rid of it. That's why they're criticizing it. That's why they demonized
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:40.440]  trailblazers. They trailblaze only when it comes to new forms of human control. They are conquering
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.560]  the great human mass. They are conquering the human psyche. They are conquering the human mind.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.280]  That's what the technocratic control freaks are up to. They don't want to empower humanity and boost
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.800]  humanity towards the stars. Everything they do is common core which is also taught under other
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.720]  names all over the world two plus two equals five and if you want to judge a ruling class a ruling
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:11.800]  elite if they teach their younglings that two plus two equals five when it equals four ladies and
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.080]  gentlemen that's an act of heresy I understand. If they can get away with that they can get away
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:24.520]  with anything. When O'Brien is torturing the ministry of truth propagandist from the media
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:32.600]  from the state run media Winston Smith in 1984 Winston says two plus two equals four the ability
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:39.880]  to be free is to simply say two plus two equals four and O'Brien says that is freedom and when
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:45.080]  I'm done smashing your mind through torture and brainwashing you're going to think two plus two
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:51.080]  equals whatever I say it is. It'll equal five one minute ten another for the next and in the end
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.080]  Winston Smith believes two plus two equals five. Now do you think there's any mistake that starting
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:04.920]  this year they teach first graders and second graders nationwide that two plus two equals five
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:11.960]  they are throwing the gauntlet down and saying we're going to teach you that the state's your
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.760]  mommy we're going to teach you that 10 year olds can have state abortions and not tell mommy
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.720]  we're going to teach you there's no parental rights we're going to do whatever we want they're not
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:26.440]  going to stop with a tsa sticking their hands down your pants grabbing your genitals they're not
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.400]  going to stop taking your bank accounts with bailouts they're not going to stop the level of
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.040]  tyranny under which you will live under to quote Thomas Jefferson is the level you'll put up with
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.200]  you want to know why this is happening look in the mirror you are unleashing every control freak
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:46.600]  sicko by laying down to them you are the problem I am the problem a nation of sheep will be ruled
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:54.120]  by demonic wolves Thomas Jefferson he said wolves I have the demonic part and there is this demonization
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.960]  of loving humanity this attack on anyone beautiful this attack on anyone smart the attack on any
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:07.160]  trailblazer any rugged individualist any creator because the technocrats have stolen the whole
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.520]  economy through fiat currency through derivatives they control it as Carl Rove said by being
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:18.440]  history's actors whatever they say whether it's true or not is reality the media reports it we
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.640]  accepted so they're trying to become gods where it isn't about what they actually built or did
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.440]  or what they stood for or being honorable it's about them controlling the giant machinery
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:35.000]  of high tech civilization we the little people built so that these control freaks who desired the
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.560]  power could play god that is the big ultimate secret and then I go see the hobbit the desolation
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.560]  of smog excellent film for the children as well as the adults wouldn't take anybody under about
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:53.400]  eight to it I see the ad for Matthew McConaughey one of Texas's favorite sons great actor I see
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:59.640]  discovered by Rick link letter my friend side issue I see the ad for interstellar and you'll
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.760]  notice everything they say in this trailer is what I've said they've told us we can't trailblaze
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:09.560]  they've told us we can't go anywhere they've told us we're over they've told us it's done well yeah
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:15.880]  if cayenne west Kanye west and all the and the NFL and all this petty stuff and distract us
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:22.120]  from the stars distract us from poetry literature expanding human consciousness if we focus on the
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:28.680]  shiny bobble it's the end of us but here is the trailer for interstellar where they you know it's
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.400]  a science fiction group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:38.280]  limitations of human space travel to conquer the vast distances involved in interstellar voyage
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:44.200]  this is all possible we need to say humans will be part of the future humans we're gonna
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.720]  ride ourselves into the script we're not gonna let the globalist ride us out of it in a foregone
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:57.960]  conclusion a self-fulfilling prophecy of fraud here is interstellar images of cornfields
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:08.920]  narrated for ready always to find ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.800]  and we count these moments the first ever to fly faster than the speed of sound
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:26.680]  these moments when we dare to aim higher that's right they hate that to break barriers
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:35.160]  the nanny state wants to stop that reach for the stars all the stoppers to make the unknown known
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.440]  the elite have already controlled things now they don't want us to have a part of it
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:46.440]  they want us to think down big small moments as our proudest achievements having fired the
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:53.240]  imagination chose at lannis both we went to the moon we went beyond the moon they don't want us to
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:15:03.160]  be part of this and perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers that we've barely
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:10.120]  begun that's right our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us that's right because our destiny
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.480]  lies above us that's right our long march to our ultimate destiny as i said in my film
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:27.000]  my documentary fall the republic one year from now interstellar is coming out by the amazing
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:34.200]  director christopher knowland this is the type of message we need this movie will be a huge hit
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:40.200]  just like superman man of steel is that a positive pro human message it's time for all of us to say
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.920]  we're done with the control freaks they want to control the future wall us off from it
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:50.920]  and hog it all for themselves because they already want to play god no we want to go to the stars
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:57.400]  we want to advance stop dumbing us down two plus two equals four and i'm not a conspiracy theorist

[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.240]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.240]  well bloomberg you as our bodyguards more than 15 of them we videotaped it
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:47.080]  blasts the arrogance of power and pledges 25 million of his own money to disarm the american
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.480]  people and complete our journey to slavery by the way the globalists have said they're
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.480]  ending manned space travel they're going to merge with machines they believe they're done with us
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:01.000]  and again we should design the future where humanity has its integrity going forward
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.120]  if you choose to end your humanity merging with machines that's your right but undoubtedly
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.520]  it's going to create a new struggle and they've already branded it to where you must accept
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.880]  their system of transhumanism every technology they've given us that our tax money's developed
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:20.520]  has been used as a trojan horse to dehumanize us so there should be a larger debate about this
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:29.640]  it's almost as important as the cults versus the texas tyrants or the texans today of course
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:35.560]  it's about a billion times more important let's go to your phone calls jt betty carillon andrew
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:42.520]  dr v maryland chris john michael get to all of you jt you're on the air from colorada
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:47.320]  you're on the air what do you think of the fact this guy wanted to go shoot the conservatives
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.480]  on the debate team and it's buried in the news but that's not gonna ever gonna be heard i guess
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:22:00.520]  well i i think it's kind of indicative of uh you know the duopoly are our whole false paradigm
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:10.360]  and the problem is that uh well the quote unquote uh liberals uh the authoritarian frothing control
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:16.920]  freaks that shoot the debate team with shotguns yeah liberals yeah you know those guys uh not
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:25.240]  not the jefferson classical liberals uh they the kids aren't uh disciplined or controlled
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.760]  and when they don't win they go grab a gun that's right because they're not allowed to ever learn
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.880]  to lose at dodgeball so when they finally lose in debate they go shoot people with shotguns
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:41.960]  you're meant you need to learn how to lose a lot i mean what's that line from the aerosmith
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.600]  you've got to lose to learn how to win can we come back with that in the next segment go ahead
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:53.240]  that's exactly correct now if you don't learn how to be a good loser you'll never be a good
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:57.000]  listen i'm not a guy that gets into physical fights because i know how to avoid them but
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.600]  when some big guy starts a fight with me i'm not scared i've already been in about 200 of them
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:06.600]  i've got to learn how to lose and know how to win and it's the same deal these people are so scared
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:12.120]  instead of ever get they banned fistfights in school so now people just shoot each other it's
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:19.400]  totally cowardly and and it's it's insane because you know it's like that overwhelming power of
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:25.880]  force and and you see it coming down from washington every day that's right he had to be right
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.400]  and they admit the local sheriff's department said he was mad at the debate team i went and
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:33.560]  looked him up they were libertarians and conservatives he went and found one shot him
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:39.320]  didn't kill him and imagine i disagree with the debate team i'm a socialist i'm going to shoot you
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:45.240]  god bless you good to hear from you brother let's talk to caroline in panama that's down in
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:53.800]  central america folks go ahead hi i like uh i'm calling to suggest that you interview
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:01.560]  mike maloney of gold silver dot com he has a really good program explaining economics to people
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:09.880]  who like me the layman and uh that you understand clearly uh how the economy's working and how to
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:13.880]  protect yourself and all you know i'm actually familiar with him he might be a good guest maybe
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:18.520]  i'll get him on what else is on your mind what do you what do you think of a democrat quote a
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:22.680]  vowed socialist going and trying to kill the debate team because they didn't agree with him
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.600]  well it should should we turn our guns into him's because he was he was for banning guns as well
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.280]  well we should give our guns to him so he can shotgun us in the head right
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.720]  yeah that's what they say i mean no that's how communism works you turn your guns in
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:43.960]  then they come kill you exactly exactly i i'm kind of against that sort of thing myself
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.880]  also unlike standing private ryan when the guy says hey let's be friends and then stabs him
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:55.960]  god bless you man good anything else no i just um i love you you speak to my heart alec well
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.880]  you're a sweetheart you speak to my heart what's going on down there in panama i hear that's pretty
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:05.080]  up in the up in the hills if you're not down in the basin oh it is it's beautiful but you know
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:11.960]  something i watch the food down here and there's fluoride in the water uh there's uh in the food
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:17.480]  the americans they made a deal with panama that there's they don't check the food when it comes
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:23.480]  in here i guess the man in the uh head of the department where they yeah that's under the
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:28.200]  trade agreement well here's the good news you can search this and look it up fertility has
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:32.280]  dropped in europe the united states and japan everywhere that puts fluoride in the water and
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:38.440]  takes the shots latin america's fertility is now plunging and of course it's because of the
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:44.120]  fluoride in the shots on record but see i'm a racist i don't want hispanics and latinos to be
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:49.800]  sterilized that's why i'm saying don't drink the fluoride don't take the Gardasil it's because
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:56.760]  i'm against hispanics that i don't want them to all die i appreciate your call yeah i saw a number
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:01.480]  just two weeks ago my dad showed it to me in the wall street journal plunging fertility in latin
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:07.720]  america yeah keep taking those shots you're not going to have any any poquitos any soon

[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.400]  through the federal interagency committee on indoor air quality and department defense
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:37.160]  united states information agency and department army all those alphabets come up
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:42.520]  they're very interesting members list also people should watch torchwood because it tells all about
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:48.440]  the FEMA camps and what they tend to do with the week and sick is to torch them well the the
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:54.920]  civilian inmate labor camp program declassified in 1998 and the emergency centers establishment
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:00.760]  act declassified three years ago tell us everything everything it's all public but
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.320]  people don't want to admit it even as obama care now takes money out of the bank accounts of those
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:11.560]  that signed up on the exchange it's now official mainstream news but it's okay then look i'm more
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:17.080]  bad because i'm right you understand you're more bad andrew because you're right have you learned
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:24.440]  that yet yes i have and i learned one more thing that in nevada it's against the law to deliberately
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.000]  poison food water and drink and medicine and look they're doing the fluoride and amongst
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.840]  other things bring those laws to bear and we'll probably stop a lot of this by using local state
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.800]  laws absolutely we need nullification the states to stand up the police and military to say no
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.360]  a rediscovery of liberty and private rights private individuals private property it's over

[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:08.040]  care this is your avenue it is what you offer the public by the way all the experts from different
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:14.920]  groups told me true iodine is the key and i cannot believe what it's done for me it i mean it is
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:20.520]  i've never talked like this it is magic folks what it's done for my psyche my health my sleeping
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:25.320]  uh what is your take on iodine i mean i didn't plan you to call in and say this i gotta tell you
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:31.480]  i i know david brownstein personally i know you've talked to him dr brownstein yeah medical doctor
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:40.200]  absolutely and uh i have uh i prescribe it to my patients unequivocally and it is the one thing
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:46.440]  if you see the uh huge amount of breast cancer that's out there you know and it's all about uh
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.000]  you know run for the cancer cure run for curing they don't tell women it's because they took the
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.360]  iodine out of the soul yeah they won't tell them absolutely they don't tell it they don't tell women
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:03.160]  that their deficiency in breast cancer is causing fibrocystic breast disease and that's where the
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.440]  problem lies incredible i know it's incredible i mean my i mean my wife got on this four months ago
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.880]  true iodine because any iodine is better than having none but this this nascent pure it turns
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:19.240]  blue on paper other iodine turns black this is the pure form of it and i'm telling you it's it's
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.600]  amazing and again the system i later learned the elite the federal government did the right thing
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:30.120]  in the 20s and made them put it in the salt but then pulled it out in the 60s why do you think that is
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.840]  well because uh there was something called the goiter belt that existed in the midwest which
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:43.240]  included uh wisconsin illinois indiana ohio michigan that's right and there's no nationally
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:49.960]  occurring iodine in that soil so they did they did it simply for the the reduction of goiter that's
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:57.160]  right and people can search this 15 point iq uh increase within two years once they put iodine
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:02.120]  in the salt and then they took it out again incredible god bless you sir yeah i didn't mean
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.200]  to go off into that was not planned to have that guy calling and say that it's just so incredible
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.520]  and that's bound iodine that's in the gourmet salts and bound iodine they used to put in the
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:16.520]  bread they took it out and put bromine in it and stuff that's illegal in europe it's just you get real
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:25.640]  iodine i mean whoa whoa that's all i gotta say whoa i mean this is this is this is incredible it's
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:31.240]  the opposite of fluoride yeah there's business insider how adding iodine to salt result in a
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:36.680]  decades worth of iq gains for the united states even if you don't get survival shield proprietary

[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:17.000]  alex jones broadcasting network network i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:26.680]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:35.800]  network all right i'm gonna go back to christ and john and mike and uh betty and a few others
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:42.200]  that are patiently holding but i was listening to our local affiliate 5 90 a.m last week and i heard
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:47.320]  this ad nothing against the station any of your ads that come to you and i've heard it on other
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:53.160]  stations around the country so i thought i'd go look this up and sure enough i heard the ad for
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:48:01.160]  new vigil gotta love that orwellian name it says it has an established safety profile most reported
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:07.160]  side effects were rated as mild to moderate common side effects of new vigil were headaches nausea
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:12.360]  dizziness and trouble sleeping seven percent of patients taking new vigil stop treatment due to
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:17.640]  side effects and then it goes over the side effects and my whole issue is america already
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:24.440]  guzzles a lot of coffee which moderate use is good for you heavy use is bad for you studies are there
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.560]  but the number one selling drink in this country is the one hour energy or five hour energy or
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:35.000]  whatever those little bottles and people are just guzzling this not getting the nutrition they need
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.360]  and now they're pushing these stimulants that the military previously used when they had to fly
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:46.200]  you know six seven missions a day in jet aircraft or you only take this during emergencies and the
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.800]  pentagon backed off of this because they had so many problems with it so i thought i would air
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:56.120]  this new vigil piece and when i looked it up on youtube somebody done a parody video so if you're
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:05.000]  a radio listener go to info wars dot com for its last show and you can actually see the parody video
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:10.920]  that goes along with the real audio but it's all these drug ads not just new vigil where you and
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.080]  they got some of them here on the network i'm on i mean i'm not judging people that have these ads
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:20.680]  it's just that now half the ad is what it does to you that sounds a hundred it's like you have
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:31.400]  restless legs syndrome well then take this and then it it says all these horrible things after
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:38.360]  it so this is a real radio ad folks this is this is a real new vigil ad airing all over the country
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.840]  on every station i've heard it i've heard it on san Antonio stations dallas stations this is a huge

[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:05.880]  story you're just talking about uh going ballistic the authoritarian solution for losing the debate
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:13.480]  all right explain me what that means well obviously the authoritarian went ballistic
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:18.440]  when he lost the debate that that was his solution no exactly that's what they do he lost the debate
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:23.960]  in colorado so he went tried to kill the librarian the speech teacher and the people he was debating
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:29.960]  with and you tie that in with historically how authoritarian's want to kill everybody because
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:34.840]  they can't control them because ultimately it's all about control it's as i've told you before
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:40.040]  when she can't have the boyfriend nobody can have the boyfriend man you you really hit the
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:44.120]  nail on the head i didn't get what you were saying at first as it caught me off guard no you're right
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:49.960]  for those that just tuned in colorado shooting friday on the anniversary of the tragic events
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:56.920]  in sandy hook this guy quote vowed democratic socialist was mad at the people he was debating
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:53:01.400]  so he went to kill them and was able to shoot one of them but thank god not kill him and that just
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:06.760]  shows that that these people historically cannot put up with anyone disagreeing with them
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:12.840]  that's it they can't they flake out because it's all about control is that they're so frigging
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:19.080]  narcissistic that it's my way or no way that's it and he blew his head off because that was the
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:25.640]  ultimate solution to end his problem which was him god bless you what a what a smart point christ
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:30.840]  just made or the or the mic from tennessee who was that from tennessee mic from tennessee

[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:47.000]  i you start page some of the stuff i'm going to say you can read it but it was about a psychologist
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.160]  that did a study on your average gun control advocate not the globalist but your just your
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:57:00.200]  average gun control advocate and he made the point in there that most of them have suffered from a
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:06.760]  higher than average murderous rage and they're afraid to own guns oh no no no no you're right
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:12.520]  buzz bissinger on pierce morgan said he wants to kill me and then later he said i apologize i'm

[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:24.600]  with a gun if they're attacking me exactly and that's what the article went on to say is he said he
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:30.840]  found that most of your gun owners are responsible citizens that you know are just your average
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.320]  joe that wants to protect their family exactly we're men and women that aren't screwballs and
