[00:00.000 --> 00:24.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.280 --> 00:29.280]  Police have now talked to, they're telling police that they heard the driver saying,
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.360]  yelling, Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, during this incident, which is now leading authorities
[00:34.360 --> 00:39.720]  to believe that this is as a result, that this is now a terrorism case.
[00:39.720 --> 00:44.840]  And I'm just getting an update now, the FBI is taking over this case, because it appears
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.400]  now that this is terrorism.
[00:46.400 --> 00:52.560]  The Arabic chanda Allah Akbar, God is great, sometimes said under the most beautiful circumstances
[00:52.560 --> 00:58.040]  and too often we hear of it being being said in moments like this.
[00:58.040 --> 01:09.120]  And then sitting right next to him is the former director of the CIA, who told everybody
[01:09.120 --> 01:14.680]  that we should basically accept Orthodox Islam.
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.520]  There is no end to these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19.520 --> 01:26.960]  That was Jake Tapper, the unintentional comedian, up there talking about, normally under beautiful
[01:26.960 --> 01:32.620]  circumstances we hear Allah Akbar, really, when do we hear Allah Akbar?
[01:32.620 --> 01:41.520]  When jihadis are killing people, and ISIS posted photos a month ago of the exact spot
[01:41.520 --> 01:48.080]  where eight people were killed and 11 injured, would have been in the hundreds like nice.
[01:48.080 --> 01:58.000]  But a police officer within 10 seconds of it starting, drew his firearm and began firing
[01:58.000 --> 02:06.060]  on the vehicle and then killed the SOB.
[02:06.060 --> 02:09.720]  There is no end to this, there is literally no end to this.
[02:09.720 --> 02:13.760]  And look at CNN last night with their live coverage, citizens know what to do to the
[02:13.760 --> 02:14.760]  enemy.
[02:14.760 --> 02:17.300]  It's promoted and brought in all the illegals.
[02:17.300 --> 02:22.320]  There are great citizens with our operation that Info Wars launched, CNN is ISIS, Mike
[02:22.320 --> 02:24.400]  Serenos' idea.
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.480]  Great job, folks, getting out there and doing it, do it everywhere because they are ISIS.
[02:29.480 --> 02:34.080]  They represent Hillary and Obama and Al Gore, they called for an Arab Spring here in America
[02:34.080 --> 02:35.800]  five years ago.
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.560]  They finance one worldwide, this is anti-Christian.
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.600]  Al Gore, let me tell you, behind the scenes is quarterbacking the attempted take down
[02:44.600 --> 02:47.600]  of free speech in America and this broadcast.
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.000]  In the next few weeks, I'll be at liberty to tell you about it, I'm not at this point.
[02:51.000 --> 03:01.920]  But we have Soros, Al Gore, you've seen Podesta saying, Alex Jones, SH, you know what, T,
[03:01.920 --> 03:04.120]  he never even tweets, but it's about me.
[03:04.120 --> 03:10.160]  And I don't say that like I'm bragging, I need everybody's prayers and I need your financial
[03:10.160 --> 03:19.440]  support because that's how we beat these people, is being able to stand against their operations.
[03:19.440 --> 03:25.120]  But I'll tell you one thing, I'm proud of the fact that Roger Stone works for Info Wars
[03:25.120 --> 03:28.400]  and he's being sued by Obama's law firm.
[03:28.400 --> 03:35.240]  And I am proud that Al Gore is coming after me because I mean to pick a fight, I mean
[03:35.240 --> 03:38.640]  to get them out in the open, let everybody see what they're doing and whatever happens
[03:38.640 --> 03:45.960]  to me, that's the way it is, but Info Wars is a champion operation, folks.
[03:45.960 --> 03:49.780]  We need you to buy the products and spread the word and hand share the videos and articles
[03:49.780 --> 03:54.440]  and you've been doing it, we're defeating them, but we are in the thick of the battle.
[03:54.440 --> 04:00.000]  And I wanna say this audience is not an audience, you are super active, you are in the arena,
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.600]  I salute you, you are the strength and the backbone, not just this country, but worldwide.
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.760]  We are the heart of the resistance and the enemy knows it and I think they can smash
[04:10.760 --> 04:15.040]  us, all that'll do is invigorate us even more.
[04:15.040 --> 04:20.560]  And as Winston Churchill said, we shall go on to the end, whatever the cost may be, we
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.880]  shall defend our republic, we shall never surrender.
[04:24.880 --> 04:30.320]  He said, we shall go on to the end, whatever the price may be, we shall defend our island,
[04:30.320 --> 04:37.200]  we shall go on to the end, we shall go on to the end, and as you can see, we're winning.
[04:37.200 --> 04:45.320]  But it is a war, quite frankly, I love it, I can't wait till I can bring all this stuff
[04:45.320 --> 04:52.080]  out very soon, but they figured out we've got PIs and people on, they're getting really
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.900]  freaked out, so I'm not telling you anything they don't know already, we'll be back, stay
[04:56.900 --> 04:57.900]  with us.
[04:57.900 --> 05:03.680]  If you go to info war store.com and get game changing amazing products, we've been sold

[05:48.960 --> 05:52.640]  an act of standing up, when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from
[05:52.640 --> 06:05.320]  us and when we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[06:05.320 --> 06:12.180]  You are listening to an info wars.com frontline report, if you are receiving this transmission,
[06:12.180 --> 06:26.520]  you are the resistance, from deep in the heart of fema region 6, Austin Texas, transmitting
[06:26.520 --> 06:36.560]  worldwide, it's Alex Jones, we had a army intel officer recently retired into other
[06:36.560 --> 06:41.920]  agencies or promoted, who I know has given us good info on air and then it's mirrored
[06:41.920 --> 06:45.920]  information I've gotten from other sources inside the deep state and he's gonna come
[06:45.920 --> 06:51.800]  on today but he got called into a meeting yesterday, they were listening and he's gotten
[06:51.800 --> 06:57.700]  in some trouble and what did he say, he said there's clearly Saudi Arabian connections
[06:57.700 --> 07:05.480]  to Vegas and that there's more imminent attacks coming in the next few days and of course
[07:05.480 --> 07:14.720]  ISIS posted a photo a month ago of the exact route, the exact spot where the bicyclers
[07:14.720 --> 07:21.700]  were run over by a cowardly sack of garbage, who would have probably killed hundreds like
[07:21.700 --> 07:29.240]  we saw in niche, what 89 dead, hundreds wounded, if a police officer hadn't started firing
[07:29.240 --> 07:36.240]  on him within 10 seconds, boom, that guy's running over people, that's on purpose and
[07:36.240 --> 07:41.840]  then got him or he probably would have killed just like in just one of the many attacks
[07:41.840 --> 07:48.560]  in France, what was it 89, including children, three, four year olds running like something
[07:48.560 --> 07:56.840]  out of the original Mad Max, just running over babies, running over toddlers, screaming
[07:56.840 --> 08:14.040]  like a retarded hound dog and oh, he was a refugee on one of the quote diversity visas
[08:14.040 --> 08:22.200]  that the UN runs via UNESCO, cultural enrichment is what it's called, it's not a joke when
[08:22.200 --> 08:26.460]  we call it that, that's their term and under UNESCO and the UN, it controls our state department
[08:26.460 --> 08:43.460]  until now and then we admit to the country, whoever they say, is that not global government?
[08:43.460 --> 08:49.280]  Look at this deranged inbred lunatic, that's why there's so much mental illness from those
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.920]  rural areas of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and other areas where this lunatic came from
[08:54.920 --> 09:03.840]  and again, the numbers are there, there is more than a 35,000% higher instance of birth
[09:03.840 --> 09:14.560]  defects in individuals from those regions that come from small towns and they are crazy,
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.640]  just like royalty in Egypt or royalty in England would become completely insane.
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.280]  You know, most of Queen Elizabeth's sisters had to be locked up in mental silence the
[09:23.280 --> 09:29.600]  rest of their lives, usually out of five or six, they get one good one, that's why they
[09:29.600 --> 09:36.720]  started marrying commoners 50 years ago, they said, gee, the genetic experts tell us this
[09:36.720 --> 09:42.400]  is why most of our family are complete lunatics, there's a headline in New York Times, Saudi
[09:42.400 --> 09:50.000]  Arabia awakens to the perils of inbreeding, they awakened to it in 2003, they also just
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.800]  awakened to not wiping their rear end with their hands, I mean, I'm not against anybody,
[09:54.800 --> 10:02.760]  I'm just saying, Jones is racist again, saying many Muslims are inbred, no, it's a fact,
[10:02.760 --> 10:08.820]  Jack, arranged marriages and then you want to know who your daughter marries, so she
[10:08.820 --> 10:16.600]  marries a first cousin and then you do it over and over and over and pretty soon your
[10:16.600 --> 10:27.120]  mom is your sister, yes, your mama said again, your mom is your sister, your mom, oh, that's
[10:27.120 --> 10:33.560]  very common, your mom is your sister and then you wonder why your eyes are pointing different
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.840]  directions literally and why you're whacked out of your mind and why you want to kill
[10:38.840 --> 10:42.920]  everybody because you're like an inbred breed of dog, you see just drooling on the side
[10:42.920 --> 10:46.720]  of the street, they go look at my high bred dog and go, yeah, I see a mentally retarded
[10:46.720 --> 10:53.240]  animal, look at this mentally retarded animal, let's put him up on screen, a vicious psychotic
[10:53.240 --> 11:04.560]  inbred ISIS, look at that guy, look at that demon, oh, and he just culturally enriched,
[11:04.560 --> 11:09.480]  and again, it's a cucking for the left, they leftist in their homes across the nation last
[11:09.480 --> 11:15.280]  night weren't just making apologies like Jake Tapper saying it's beautiful but a lot of
[11:15.280 --> 11:20.040]  them you can better believe were engaging in self-flagellation and I'm not joking when
[11:20.040 --> 11:27.160]  I say that, they love this, the fact that the left can bring in millions of these people
[11:27.160 --> 11:37.320]  with their eyes pointing different directions from the inbreeding and but totally psychotic,
[11:37.320 --> 11:43.400]  always believe their God like a lot of other seriously inbred mentally retarded people,
[11:43.400 --> 11:49.960]  it's very sad but this type of inbreeding creates psychotic psychosis in high numbers
[11:49.960 --> 11:56.400]  so it's not just the religion folks, it's the inbreeding, armies of inbred psycho killers,
[11:56.400 --> 12:06.640]  zombo psycho inbred Muslim hillbillies attacking, everybody knows there is the Appalachia where
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.160]  some people are inbred, you don't mess with those people, they'll kill you in two seconds
[12:10.160 --> 12:18.440]  because they're inbred folks, they're crazy, imagine if there was a billion Appalachians
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.280]  in the world and half of them were inbred psychotic and they're just literally raining
[12:23.280 --> 12:32.080]  them down on us, excuse me, I just got to tell you like it is, so Trump said we got
[12:32.080 --> 12:37.920]  to stop these visas from unvented countries, this guy had terror ties, he'd never been
[12:37.920 --> 12:41.920]  allowed in, in 2015 he was running around saying he was going to kill people so the
[12:41.920 --> 12:47.720]  FBI went but that was Obama's FBI, just like San Bernardino or just like Fort Hood or the
[12:47.720 --> 12:54.120]  hundreds of other attacks now in the western world, it's covered up and not an act of terror
[12:54.120 --> 13:01.440]  but this guy in front of witnesses was chirping, chirping the Allah Akbar, I'm an inbred piece
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.680]  of garbage, so he was chirping, I'm an inbred psychopath with delusions of grandeur, that's
[13:06.680 --> 13:10.080]  what you get when you're inbred is a lot of times just delusions of grandeur, you think
[13:10.080 --> 13:15.920]  you're invincible, you're a drooling idiot who wipes his butt with your hand but you're
[13:15.920 --> 13:23.000]  God and Linda Sorsour loves you and wants to put women under it because look at Linda
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.640]  Sorsour, looks like his brother, it's the same dude, same genetics, all scrambled together
[13:30.640 --> 13:39.880]  all the slave trading, all of it comes from these folks and we're supposed to be culturally
[13:39.880 --> 13:45.540]  rich and too bad you didn't fully take Europe 1400 years ago, too bad there was a counter
[13:45.540 --> 13:51.160]  strike called the Crusades, we're going to apologize, please take us over, please inbreed
[13:51.160 --> 13:58.240]  us and pour acid on our faces and cut women's genitals off and murder the gays, it's liberal,
[13:58.240 --> 14:07.360]  murder us, murder us, we're liberal, oh but things aren't going too well, here's the headline
[14:07.360 --> 14:16.700]  today, Hollywood accusers, harassers, molesters, rapists, the rap sheets, 56 so far and suddenly
[14:16.700 --> 14:23.360]  it's pedophilia popping up, oh and who does Harvey Weinstein like, he wants to bring in
[14:23.360 --> 14:32.760]  Muslims to cock your world, just like he likes to debase women and young girls, he's going
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.040]  to debase the whole country, he said yesterday he's given the world a gift with what he's
[14:38.040 --> 14:44.320]  just done, you're lucky I've given you this gift, I'm Harvey Weinstein, now just like
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.640]  Europe just took in 10 million military age men, you're going to take it and they're going
[14:48.640 --> 14:57.560]  to slaughter you all they want, it's liberal, oh it's so liberal, these are the insane maniacs
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.480]  that think they're God but here's the thing, we're awake, we're aware of you, we're never
[15:03.480 --> 15:09.760]  going away, we're never stopping, we're never backing down, we're never giving in and we're
[15:09.760 --> 15:18.880]  winning scum, so enjoy the long dark night that's coming for you.
[15:18.880 --> 15:25.280]  Now continuing here, let's read more about the cultural enrichment, can we put our enricher
[15:25.280 --> 15:31.520]  back on the television for us here, we're about to go to break but there's our enricher,
[15:31.520 --> 15:36.440]  he showed us and it was cultural, it's just culture, don't judge a culture, killing people
[15:36.440 --> 15:40.800]  is his culture, everyone should thank him, the victim's families, those barely alive
[15:40.800 --> 15:44.920]  should say, oh Allah Akbar, like Tapper said, I'm going to play it when we come back, Allah
[15:44.920 --> 15:50.440]  Akbar, it's so beautiful, in the middle of this, Tapper says, oh it's so beautiful, it's
[15:50.440 --> 16:00.400]  so beautiful, you are the resistance, fully cooked, ready to eat bacon, I'm talking thick

[20:01.560 --> 20:14.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:14.320 --> 20:27.160]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind.
[20:27.160 --> 20:32.600]  Police have now talked to, they're telling police that they heard the driver saying yelling
[20:32.600 --> 20:38.040]  Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar during this incident which is now leading authorities to believe
[20:38.040 --> 20:43.560]  that this is as a result, that this is now a terrorism case and I'm just getting an update
[20:43.560 --> 20:48.780]  now the FBI is taking over this case because it appears now that this is terrorism.
[20:48.780 --> 20:54.240]  The Arabic chanda Allah Akbar, God is great, sometimes as said under the most beautiful
[20:54.240 --> 21:01.320]  circumstances and too often we hear of it being said in moments like this.
[21:01.320 --> 21:06.800]  They brought in 10 million people into the EU the last five years, 80% of them according
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.320]  to Interpol are military age men, most of them are military refugees, they're people
[21:11.320 --> 21:15.560]  that came and invaded Syria and other areas, they're fighters left over from the Libya
[21:15.560 --> 21:22.960]  takeover and they're being brought into Europe and from Sweden to Denmark to the UK, they
[21:22.960 --> 21:30.080]  take actual terrorists that are famous, killing people on television, killing unarmed prisoners
[21:30.080 --> 21:36.800]  and they rehabilitate them giving them housing, welfare and classes taught by other emons
[21:36.800 --> 21:44.520]  and it's all like this weird sick politically correct joke run by the EU.
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.920]  And that's the thing is I think about this and how Trump was demonized for saying seven
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.240]  countries that don't even have working airports or passport systems like Somalia, like Sudan,
[21:56.240 --> 22:03.080]  like Libya, you don't get to come here, we're not giving you visas, I mean you can't go
[22:03.080 --> 22:10.320]  to Japan unless you've got a visa, doesn't matter where you're from, you can't go to
[22:10.320 --> 22:15.080]  Russia unless you have a visa, you can't Mexico, you tell them how long you're gonna be there,
[22:15.080 --> 22:19.000]  you get a limited visa when you fly in to Cancun or whatever, you tell them when you're
[22:19.000 --> 22:22.840]  gonna be there, where you're staying, your phone number and when you're leaving.
[22:22.840 --> 22:25.800]  And let me tell you something, I know folks that have gone down to Mexico decided to stay
[22:25.800 --> 22:33.480]  a couple extra days, they call the hotel up the next day and say, where is Mr. Johnson?
[22:33.480 --> 22:41.080]  And if they catch you there illegally, six months to a year hard prison time, again,
[22:41.080 --> 22:50.200]  but then all I hear about our super open society and country, then is racist and evil and bad
[22:50.200 --> 22:54.360]  and then all these courts fought the president when the law is very clear, he finally wins,
[22:54.360 --> 22:59.280]  nine to zero at the Supreme Court, and we saw Nice where the police did shoot and kill
[22:59.280 --> 23:00.280]  the driver.
[23:00.280 --> 23:04.960]  I was having a Freudian thing when I said this hero police officer shot and killed this
[23:04.960 --> 23:10.440]  guy, he shot him and stopped him, killed his terror attack, he is still alive, which is
[23:10.440 --> 23:13.420]  bittersweet, I wish he was dead.
[23:13.420 --> 23:17.880]  But at the same time, they'll get more intel off of this guy, but they already knew in
[23:17.880 --> 23:21.640]  2015, he was shooting his mouth off about killing people.
[23:21.640 --> 23:33.440]  His imam to his credit said, hey, I told the police they didn't do anything and they could
[23:33.440 --> 23:36.760]  have stopped him, but they didn't and why?
[23:36.760 --> 23:42.320]  Which is rare to actually have one of these guys imams, I guess he didn't wanna spend
[23:42.320 --> 23:46.840]  the rest of his life in a supermax prison, probably a smart move to have tried to stop
[23:46.840 --> 23:47.840]  this.
[23:47.840 --> 23:51.320]  And listen, folks, I didn't wanna go into the Middle East, I didn't wanna destabilize
[23:51.320 --> 23:57.200]  Iraq to bring in the more radical Muslims out of Saudi Arabia, I don't hate people under
[23:57.200 --> 23:59.640]  authoritarian regimes.
[23:59.640 --> 24:03.960]  And I know there's been periods in the world when Muslims weren't all killing each other
[24:03.960 --> 24:08.440]  and weren't invading all their neighbors, and I know Christianity has had its expansionist
[24:08.440 --> 24:11.920]  and authoritative stripes.
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.720]  But Islam today is out of control and is empowered by Soros and the globalist and is a clear
[24:18.720 --> 24:24.000]  and present weapon being used against our countries.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.240]  It's incompatible, I can't go to their countries and practice my religion or not practice it
[24:28.240 --> 24:31.640]  or be gay if I was gay.
[24:31.640 --> 24:40.120]  That's fundamental, ladies and gentlemen, or be a Buddhist or be an atheist.
[24:40.120 --> 24:45.960]  If I lived in Saudi Arabia, my wife or daughters couldn't take driver's education or drive
[24:45.960 --> 24:46.960]  a car?
[24:46.960 --> 24:52.880]  And I don't need to repeat all this, it's just we have attacks now every week in Europe,
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.020]  every week in Canada or the US, every week in Australia.
[24:57.020 --> 25:01.960]  There are constant attacks where the Allah Akbar individual will shoot four or five people
[25:01.960 --> 25:03.980]  and scream Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar.
[25:03.980 --> 25:07.880]  Just two weeks ago in Maryland, killed six people screaming Allah Akbar.
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.640]  It didn't even make national news except for Fox.
[25:11.640 --> 25:16.960]  People say, Fox is so right wing, they showed you it was a Muslim attack?
[25:16.960 --> 25:23.000]  That's the benchmark of conservatism is just to admit another religious zealot programmed
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.680]  to kill, went out and did it and killed six people and what, wounded four others?
[25:27.680 --> 25:35.480]  It was a manhunt for the guy and it wasn't even in the national news, a manhunt and they
[25:35.480 --> 25:38.320]  won't put it on television.
[25:38.320 --> 25:44.320]  But now, this guy posted reportedly to the Internet what he's gonna do, he had two fake
[25:44.320 --> 25:46.760]  guns on him, they're trying to blame guns.
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.920]  There's a fake tweet out there speaking of fake guns of Hillary, it's satire, not fake
[25:51.920 --> 25:56.440]  news, satire from a satire account, put it on screen.
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.640]  Hillary reportedly tweeted satirically, but it wasn't Hillary, again, a spoof account
[26:01.640 --> 26:09.800]  of Hillary Clinton tweeted, imagine if the truck would have had a silencer, exactly.
[26:09.800 --> 26:17.360]  Just like Vegas, imagine if the truck driver had a silencer.
[26:17.360 --> 26:21.560]  Satire is king in a world of lunacy, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:21.560 --> 26:36.800]  So we have this individual, Saifulo Saipahov, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, New York
[26:36.800 --> 26:43.760]  City, five Argentine nationals and a Belgian were among those killed when a man plowed
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.120]  into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path in New York City.
[26:50.120 --> 26:53.720]  Police shot the suspect after he exited the vehicle and shot at Allah Akbar, which means
[26:53.720 --> 26:55.000]  God is great in Arabic.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.040]  He is currently in police custody and officials said they're investigating the incident as
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.080]  an act of terror, eight dead, 11 injured.
[27:03.080 --> 27:10.000]  Saifulo came to the US from Uzbekistan seven years ago, he left a note referencing the
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.040]  Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, a federal law enforcement source confirmed.
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.520]  And you know, if Trump wasn't in, there'd be no chance the FBI would tell you it was
[27:19.520 --> 27:20.520]  even Islamic.
[27:20.520 --> 27:28.440]  Under Obama, Pulse Nightclub, San Bernardino, they would come out and say it's not Islamic,
[27:28.440 --> 27:29.440]  it's not Islamic.
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.400]  And then four or five days later, you'd learn it was Islamic.
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.400]  And then the guy's weirdo dad shows up at a Democratic Party function for Hillary.
[27:37.400 --> 27:43.840]  I mean, it's just insane how arrogant these people are.
[27:43.840 --> 27:47.880]  And they know full well that we're not invited into their nations and other countries.
[27:47.880 --> 27:51.440]  They know full well they're not from tolerant societies.
[27:51.440 --> 27:56.240]  And so let's stop pretending that's the case.
[27:56.240 --> 27:59.480]  But I'm gonna go over the attack in detail and get into some other important areas on
[27:59.480 --> 28:00.480]  the other side.
[28:00.480 --> 28:04.240]  But Jake Tapper is paid to do what he does.
[28:04.240 --> 28:10.800]  And he just said Allah Akbar is usually so beautiful, it's so beautiful, that's really
[28:10.800 --> 28:11.800]  sick.
[28:11.800 --> 28:22.720]  And what he is doing is virtue signaling from CNN that we got your back and keep doing what
[28:22.720 --> 28:23.720]  you're doing.
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.760]  Kind of like the individual that went out and shot Congressman Scalise and others.
[28:28.760 --> 28:37.720]  That day, Wolf Blitzer had a guest on, saying that he was a hero.
[28:37.720 --> 28:39.920]  Wolf Blitzer didn't disagree.
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.920]  We'll be right back.
[28:41.920 --> 28:45.000]  Stay with us.
[28:45.000 --> 28:54.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[29:59.680 --> 30:02.600]  America is an information-based civil war.
[30:02.600 --> 30:06.920]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists
[30:06.920 --> 30:10.000]  scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[30:10.000 --> 30:16.440]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[30:16.440 --> 30:22.360]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[30:22.360 --> 30:23.960]  the counterculture.
[30:23.960 --> 30:30.120]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom,
[30:30.120 --> 30:32.480]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[30:32.480 --> 30:37.620]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Deberson's classical liberalism.
[30:37.620 --> 30:38.620]  They are the anti-liberal.
[30:38.620 --> 30:44.200]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.

[31:10.160 --> 31:12.240]  mushroom, beet pollen, and more.
[31:12.240 --> 31:13.240]  Concentrate.
[31:13.240 --> 31:17.200]  You talk about next level meal replacement, next level compared to whey, and it's great
[31:17.200 --> 31:19.000]  to mix with whey and then mix shakes.
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.280]  It's incredible.
[31:20.280 --> 31:22.360]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[31:22.360 --> 31:25.200]  It's bigger than I am already, 15, incredible.

[31:31.120 --> 31:32.120]  It's about to end.
[31:32.120 --> 31:35.320]  And, folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[31:35.320 --> 31:39.720]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes
[31:39.720 --> 31:40.720]  are too high.
[31:40.720 --> 31:41.720]  The globalists win.
[31:41.720 --> 31:42.720]  We're all slaves.
[31:42.720 --> 31:43.720]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[31:43.720 --> 31:45.200]  I want to thank you.
[31:45.200 --> 31:46.200]  We're all in this together.
[31:46.200 --> 31:51.160]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts and you get the great books and videos, you're

[32:23.240 --> 32:25.120]  deep earth iodine crystals.

[32:29.840 --> 32:32.880]  every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[32:32.880 --> 32:37.540]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight

[33:27.880 --> 33:31.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:31.960 --> 33:44.000]  Now coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play six minutes of a phone call from a
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.760]  caller that goes by the name Zach, who recently got out of Army Special Forces Command out
[33:52.760 --> 33:58.320]  of Florida, and who's been calling for years, but really been giving us amazing information
[33:58.320 --> 34:06.420]  that's open source as a citizen, not classified or secret, on the show.
[34:06.420 --> 34:10.880]  And I know it's amazing information because I've already got most of the same information.
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.480]  Sometimes I have more information, sometimes a lot less, but I get the same information.
[34:14.480 --> 34:18.800]  Plus, I do my own research, so I can tell he's for real.
[34:18.800 --> 34:20.800]  I said, I want you on for a full hour tomorrow.
[34:20.800 --> 34:24.280]  They called him right after the show, they were listening, and they called him into a
[34:24.280 --> 34:29.160]  meeting and are chewing him out right now, even though it's his right to do that.
[34:29.160 --> 34:34.120]  Just like Colonel Shaffer got chewed out for exposing Benghazi.
[34:34.120 --> 34:35.120]  And so much more.
[34:35.120 --> 34:40.840]  So next segment, I'm going to air those excerpts of what he talked about with Vegas and the
[34:40.840 --> 34:43.880]  big imminent terror attacks that are coming.
[34:43.880 --> 34:44.880]  He said imminent.
[34:44.880 --> 34:48.080]  And then, of course, hours later, we see another Islamic terror attack.
[34:48.080 --> 34:58.080]  Look at that evil grin, that murderous, satisfied, psycho look that you see in the eyes of British
[34:58.080 --> 34:59.280]  royalty.
[34:59.280 --> 35:00.280]  It's the inbreeding.
[35:00.280 --> 35:04.640]  And again, the New York Times even admits it, serious crime problems, mental illness
[35:04.640 --> 35:11.240]  problems, birth defect problems with folks out of Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
[35:11.240 --> 35:14.340]  and other areas because of the inbreeding.
[35:14.340 --> 35:15.340]  And it is a fact.
[35:15.340 --> 35:18.800]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[35:18.800 --> 35:29.520]  We were just showing you an image of the famous Habsburg chin that, again, a lot of our Islamic
[35:29.520 --> 35:31.600]  friends have it as well.
[35:31.600 --> 35:35.840]  Also the lazy eye is another thing.
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.320]  But in England, they see lazy eyes as a sign of royalty and nobility.
[35:40.320 --> 35:46.040]  I mean, you go to some highfalutin event with British aristocracy or, you know, folks in
[35:46.040 --> 35:49.800]  the upper crust, and I've been to a few of them, I mean, there aren't hardly any eyeballs
[35:49.800 --> 35:50.800]  pointing the right direction.
[35:50.800 --> 35:51.800]  Excuse me.
[35:51.800 --> 35:57.360]  The point is, is that we've got even more inbreeding going on here.
[35:57.360 --> 36:00.400]  But I'm sorry, I am just getting to the bottom of the problem here.
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.960]  Back to what I was about to say for the earlier segment.
[36:05.960 --> 36:12.960]  We have people like Jake Tapper coming out and saying, oh, he yelled Allah Akbar, usually
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.120]  such a beautiful, beautiful thing when we hear it.
[36:16.120 --> 36:18.000]  But now all too often a bad thing.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.560]  That's a no-no on CNN to say Islamic terror, even Allah Akbar.
[36:21.560 --> 36:23.920]  So the reporter is obviously going to get some trouble for that.
[36:23.920 --> 36:28.600]  Notice they won't even say Allah Akbar in the text on screen for TV viewers.
[36:28.600 --> 36:33.240]  There it is, 5.04 p.m., New York, about an hour and 30 minutes into it.
[36:33.240 --> 36:37.240]  Witnesses suspect was yelling God is great in Arabic.
[36:37.240 --> 36:42.640]  No, it should say he was yelling Allah Akbar, which is God is great in Arabic, but they
[36:42.640 --> 36:43.940]  always do it.
[36:43.940 --> 36:45.320]  It's how they whitewash.
[36:45.320 --> 36:46.320]  It's how they manipulate.
[36:46.320 --> 36:50.640]  And again, I can't go to these Muslim countries and live.
[36:50.640 --> 36:52.200]  Their women have their genitals cut off.
[36:52.200 --> 36:53.500]  They kill gay people.
[36:53.500 --> 36:54.900]  What in the world is going on?
[36:54.900 --> 36:59.240]  Why are the Hollywood degenerate pedophile elite?
[36:59.240 --> 37:01.340]  The elite maggots, the alpha maggots.
[37:01.340 --> 37:05.940]  Why are they lecturing us on how we should run our culture and run our life?
[37:05.940 --> 37:12.160]  They want to bring in another group of people where child molestation is codified.
[37:12.160 --> 37:14.640]  Nine-year-old girls are okay for men to have sex with.
[37:14.640 --> 37:17.860]  It's okay for men to have sex with boys, just not with other men.
[37:17.860 --> 37:18.960]  That's executable offense.
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.320]  So pedophilia is legal.
[37:23.320 --> 37:30.540]  Under Sharia, they actually call it man-boy love, which you notice the North American
[37:30.540 --> 37:32.120]  Man-Boy Love Association.
[37:32.120 --> 37:35.720]  Start to figure this out, folks.
[37:35.720 --> 37:41.760]  There's a reason Hollywood is completely allied.
[37:41.760 --> 37:48.340]  There it is, report ISIS leader encourages pedophilia.
[37:48.340 --> 37:55.200]  Enjoying young boys is in the absence of women.
[37:55.200 --> 37:56.200]  Enjoy young boys.
[37:56.200 --> 37:59.360]  It's like you enjoy women, forcing them into harems.
[37:59.360 --> 38:01.920]  That's a fancy name for sex slavery.
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.520]  But the West is where slavery came from.
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.040]  We're the bad ones.
[38:07.040 --> 38:08.640]  We're the evil people.
[38:08.640 --> 38:11.360]  We're the folks that have to be gotten rid of.
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.640]  It's amazing.
[38:16.640 --> 38:22.980]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[38:22.980 --> 38:29.400]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[38:29.400 --> 38:40.640]  or videos or other material from info war store.com, you are funding the revolution.
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.200]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[38:44.200 --> 38:48.280]  And because of the amazing success we've all had together in this endeavor, we are a bigger
[38:48.280 --> 38:49.660]  target than ever.
[38:49.660 --> 38:50.660]  And I don't mind that.
[38:50.660 --> 38:55.340]  I'm not looking for the shade.
[38:55.340 --> 38:57.720]  I'm not trying to hide in the weeds here.
[38:57.720 --> 39:03.560]  I'm trying to take on the globalist cat on so people can see exactly what's going on.
[39:03.560 --> 39:10.480]  And if you will just commit, it's so essential and make the decision to buy high quality
[39:10.480 --> 39:18.380]  products in as much abundance as you see fit, we are basically unstoppable.
[39:18.380 --> 39:20.920]  They just want to kill my name and sue us out of existence.
[39:20.920 --> 39:21.920]  That's not going to work.
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.520]  We've already done incredible work together, but I know together, we're going to build
[39:25.520 --> 39:30.400]  even more resistance and be more effective.
[39:30.400 --> 39:35.680]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at info war store.com.
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.160]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[39:40.160 --> 39:44.040]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[39:44.040 --> 39:46.500]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[39:46.500 --> 39:49.160]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[39:49.160 --> 39:51.840]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[39:51.840 --> 39:54.900]  The concentrated as well from Emirates essential.
[39:54.900 --> 39:56.140]  We've got the caveman.
[39:56.140 --> 39:58.620]  We've got so many other great products.
[39:58.620 --> 40:01.960]  The X2 is such an important thing.
[40:01.960 --> 40:05.060]  The purest iodine that anybody's got out there.
[40:05.060 --> 40:11.260]  It is just amazing the quality and it's the missing halogen in the body.
[40:11.260 --> 40:14.980]  The bad halogens are the chlorine and the fluoride and the bromide and what we're being
[40:14.980 --> 40:20.820]  bombarded with that lowers IQ and that again, if your body doesn't have the good iodine,
[40:20.820 --> 40:23.920]  it will just absorb the bad halogens.
[40:23.920 --> 40:31.440]  It's such a game changer that alone info wars life.com or triple eight two five three three
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.440]  one three nine.
[40:32.440 --> 40:39.940]  That's triple eight two five three three one three nine and we are ending the special today.
[40:39.940 --> 40:45.300]  Anthroplex and brain force together, 50% off.
[40:45.300 --> 40:51.940]  That is ending today, 50% off Anthroplex and brain force plus DNA force has been sold out
[40:51.940 --> 40:53.100]  for almost four months.
[40:53.100 --> 41:00.740]  It's so hard to source the PQQ and the co Q12 that are actually from the organic source
[41:00.740 --> 41:02.060]  not synthetic.
[41:02.060 --> 41:03.860]  We sell ours at the same price.
[41:03.860 --> 41:08.220]  People sell a synthetic that a lot of evidence shows you don't even absorb.
[41:08.220 --> 41:11.700]  So it's very hard, it's got a whole bunch of ingredients in it to get them all in, get
[41:11.700 --> 41:14.820]  them all source, have them all past California standards, which this is doing.
[41:14.820 --> 41:16.500]  We've got the test.
[41:16.500 --> 41:19.260]  They've done the test there and found it and then they test it over and over until they
[41:19.260 --> 41:24.020]  find a batch that goes slightly above California, even though the FDA says a thousand times
[41:24.020 --> 41:27.880]  what they say California is what's dangerous.
[41:27.880 --> 41:29.180]  We all know how the ball game works.
[41:29.180 --> 41:32.820]  The point is we go through a lot of trouble making these be the very, very cleanest on
[41:32.820 --> 41:34.060]  the market.
[41:34.060 --> 41:38.920]  So DNA force, super high quality, 25% off out of the gates.
[41:38.920 --> 41:41.820]  And unfortunately, we were only able to get a small run of these.
[41:41.820 --> 41:44.140]  So it's going to sell out in the next two weeks.
[41:44.140 --> 41:46.700]  So if you want to take advantage of that and support the broadcast, I want to thank you
[41:46.700 --> 41:48.880]  all for your financial support.
[41:48.880 --> 41:55.300]  But it's symbiotic DNA force has hundreds of studies we're even allowed to talk about
[41:55.300 --> 42:00.580]  because bio PQQ and co QT and these other things and the reserve at all are known.
[42:00.580 --> 42:05.580]  I mean, a lot of these are drugs in Europe, so you talk about cleaning out your cells,
[42:05.580 --> 42:07.660]  you're talking about next level antioxidant.
[42:07.660 --> 42:09.480]  This is the best there is.
[42:09.480 --> 42:14.580]  They sell similar stuff in clinics for 400 to $600 and then people go well, it's from
[42:14.580 --> 42:15.580]  a doctor.
[42:15.580 --> 42:18.460]  It must be worth it when our stuff is better than most of the ones that are out there for
[42:18.460 --> 42:22.420]  200 bucks on the low end, 600 on the high end.
[42:22.420 --> 42:26.120]  People do all sorts of other wild things where they take these similar things intravenously
[42:26.120 --> 42:27.120]  from a doctor.
[42:27.120 --> 42:35.180]  This is taken in tablet, so DNA force is back 25% off and biome defense, the amazing probiotic
[42:35.180 --> 42:37.660]  very best we could come up with the top companies.
[42:37.660 --> 42:44.980]  That is also 25% off info wars life.com or triple H two five three three one three nine

[42:49.560 --> 42:53.740]  against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know
[42:53.740 --> 42:56.100]  we know who they are and they're coming back against us.
[42:56.100 --> 42:57.100]  So we need your support.

[43:02.100 --> 43:06.700]  We've been sold out of DNA force for almost four months.

[43:11.660 --> 43:12.660]  all of it.
[43:12.660 --> 43:18.100]  It's 25% off the truck got in this morning and it's back but it is a limited run because

[47:33.600 --> 47:42.940]  The New York Times can truly be called an evil publication when I do read it every page
[47:42.940 --> 47:53.440]  every headline screams deceit corruption evil lies the whole paper is dedicated to forcing
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.260]  the United States into an authoritarian world government and here's just two examples in
[47:58.260 --> 48:06.640]  today's New York Times the cover of the New York Times mile long Manhattan truck attack
[48:06.640 --> 48:17.020]  kills eight the headline ladies and gentlemen the headline ladies and gentlemen should be
[48:17.020 --> 48:28.620]  Islamic terrorist runs over eight people with a truck in act of terror but it gets better
[48:28.620 --> 48:35.780]  there's a full page ad put out by refuse fascism that is a George Soros funded group you cannot
[48:35.780 --> 48:47.260]  make this up and it says it begins November 4th overthrow Trump overthrow the government
[48:47.260 --> 48:51.740]  but then when I cover the fact that they're planning this big launch November 4th building
[48:51.740 --> 48:56.960]  up to the one year anniversary of Trump being elected next week that I've made it up their
[48:56.960 --> 49:05.980]  actual news articles out there saying I made it all up nothing's coming November 4th well
[49:05.980 --> 49:11.740]  we've already seen Vegas it's got Islamic ties clearly and we just saw this last night
[49:11.740 --> 49:17.420]  and you better believe it's coming and coming soon and you better be aware of it and awake
[49:17.420 --> 49:24.240]  folks we're going to play some key audio in fact it dovetails with that information right
[49:24.240 --> 49:29.980]  now Zach called into the show yesterday he's been calling in for years but he recently
[49:29.980 --> 49:37.020]  got out of being attached to the army special forces command in Florida and he didn't give
[49:37.020 --> 49:41.780]  us any secrets he talked about what he is a private citizen I was talking to his friends
[49:41.780 --> 49:46.900]  about and what he's researching and the information he's getting and the reason I know he's credible
[49:46.900 --> 49:51.780]  is because I get the same information sometimes he has more than I do sometimes I have more
[49:51.780 --> 49:56.200]  than he does but he's given us a lot of great information nothing secret just the fact that
[49:56.200 --> 49:59.460]  they're getting a lot of chatter about Islamic attacks coming which we already see happening
[49:59.460 --> 50:04.980]  now he was going to come on today for a full hour as a guest soon as he hung up the phone
[50:04.980 --> 50:10.660]  yesterday he got a call and got called into a meeting for what he was talking about on
[50:10.660 --> 50:16.260]  air and may not be able to talk to us anymore even though he wasn't giving us anything secret
[50:16.260 --> 50:21.900]  ladies and gentlemen because the higher ups don't want the American people know what's
[50:21.900 --> 50:25.260]  happening they don't want us to stand with the president who's been predicting the Islamic
[50:25.260 --> 50:29.820]  attacks and how it's linked up with the left that's why they'll announce their attacks
[50:29.820 --> 50:33.300]  announce that they're going to cop kill announce they're going to get violent announce their
[50:33.300 --> 50:37.220]  training militarily all the Intel's come in we've shown you the undercover videos all
[50:37.220 --> 50:41.460]  of it and then they go oh Jones is making that up Veritas is making that up louder with
[50:41.460 --> 50:46.000]  the crowders making that up we're not planning anything November 4th and they've got big
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.700]  giant articles this nightmare must end the Trump Pence regime must go November 4th it
[50:51.700 --> 50:57.180]  begins be there join with thousands who gather in cities and towns across the country a movement
[50:57.180 --> 51:02.100]  of protests that continue every day and night growing until we become millions determined
[51:02.100 --> 51:08.420]  not to stop until the regime is driven from power 18 billion put in by George Soros to
[51:08.420 --> 51:14.960]  be led by Linda sorcerer the pro-sexual mutilation Muslim now let's go ahead ladies and gentlemen
[51:14.960 --> 51:20.620]  and go to the Intel they don't want you to hear about companies that should be investigated
[51:20.620 --> 51:25.900]  and looked into for what they know because Saudi Arabia has promised through its surrogates
[51:25.900 --> 51:30.180]  to carry out terror attacks in Russia and the US before if we didn't follow their orders
[51:30.180 --> 51:35.120]  quote in tourist areas I'm not saying that's what happened when this was an Islamic attack
[51:35.120 --> 51:41.340]  last night though of Wahhabism that's what Isis is so that's a Saudi Arabian gift a beautiful
[51:41.340 --> 51:47.180]  thing as Jake Tapper said there's a lot more so beautiful most beautiful show so here's
[51:47.180 --> 51:52.860]  the Intel they don't want you to hear let's go to Zach in Tampa Florida Zach you're on
[51:52.860 --> 51:59.660]  the air with Shepard of Intel up yes Alex Shepard's great to be on with you how to connect
[51:59.660 --> 52:05.420]  some dots because what they put off here in Vegas was just just too far so first and foremost
[52:05.420 --> 52:11.540]  what we have is and this is public knowledge you have the for us fund management group
[52:11.540 --> 52:17.220]  the LLC putting $42 million worth of put options on the MGM on I forgot that yeah I mean a
[52:17.220 --> 52:21.060]  record put option the link before go ahead but yeah so I mean that's that's just part
[52:21.060 --> 52:25.500]  of it so I mean you can't look past that that's obvious but also what we have here is the
[52:25.500 --> 52:32.940]  private military company the Saudi Arabian based ETS risk management company that's confirmed
[52:32.940 --> 52:38.140]  to everything the caller is saying is documented because this is the final pieces you had you
[52:38.140 --> 52:43.860]  had all this royalty there and you had this Saudi Air Force there that week so yeah this
[52:43.860 --> 52:49.260]  ETS risk management company is a PMC that's real shady and they don't work now within
[52:49.260 --> 52:53.140]  the government because who's in the White House but they did work with during during
[52:53.140 --> 52:57.820]  Libya with the Clinton's you know I got some guys down here in the forensic accounting
[52:57.820 --> 53:01.300]  if you look into the contract let's start over Zach's recently gotten out of the military
[53:01.300 --> 53:04.860]  and the whole intelligence area we'll leave it at that called a lot of good info in the
[53:04.860 --> 53:09.820]  past six months so just start back over this is really important right so the timeline
[53:09.820 --> 53:13.820]  is pretty unprecedented let alone with you know so you get the $42 million worth of put
[53:13.820 --> 53:19.260]  options done by the by the uh the George Soros fund management group and also you have a
[53:19.260 --> 53:25.140]  you have a contract being fulfilled by ETS risk management but this isn't this contract
[53:25.140 --> 53:30.880]  was not fulfilled by DOD okay so this is sort of a this is where it gets tricky but they
[53:30.880 --> 53:35.980]  were working and there are PMCs that work kind of in vacuumed in Libya in Syria and
[53:35.980 --> 53:41.000]  they do certain drill stateside as well but they were there that weekend everybody knows
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.500]  they were there that weekend so this is a private company that's great that is actually
[53:46.500 --> 53:50.380]  ran and you can pull them up ETS but they were ran out of Saudi Arabia but they they
[53:50.380 --> 53:55.500]  did they did work during 2013 in Libya and that's fiasco so when you're saying and people
[53:55.500 --> 53:59.820]  bat their eyes saying that this is Islamic this is Islamic not in the sense that it's
[53:59.820 --> 54:05.340]  done by Islamic groups but in a way ISIS itself was the creation of these private military
[54:05.340 --> 54:09.340]  groups and if you want to you know back in the day they they turned like Al Ciaida and
[54:09.340 --> 54:13.100]  this is real so you have these private military companies that are backed and written by the
[54:13.100 --> 54:20.020]  deep state you know creating this chaos around the world and with full validation 100% ETS
[54:20.020 --> 54:25.300]  risk management was on the ground in Vegas that night and this gentleman who you have
[54:25.300 --> 54:31.300]  on he's talking about these choppers um being in the area he's spot on and the issues the
[54:31.300 --> 54:35.140]  next thing I gotta bring up is the forensic accounting that's going to be brought up because
[54:35.140 --> 54:39.740]  there's individuals that are aware of this in today's day and age when you have these
[54:39.740 --> 54:44.180]  transfers and you're transferring large sums of money people in the intelligence agencies
[54:44.180 --> 54:48.700]  who are either in or out are not going to stay quiet and this is big and this stuff's
[54:48.700 --> 54:53.140]  coming out right now um so you have to put everything in perspective in the context of
[54:53.140 --> 54:57.180]  during this whole war these wars in Libya and Syria where they're destabilizing the
[54:57.180 --> 55:01.860]  region there were legitimate private military companies giving hundreds of millions of dollars
[55:01.860 --> 55:06.060]  to kind of you know create this war there so when you have a new administration come
[55:06.060 --> 55:09.460]  in to come into power and they're no longer you know getting those paychecks it's not
[55:09.460 --> 55:13.380]  like they pick up new hobbies okay there's still guns for hire and they're still working
[55:13.380 --> 55:18.380]  and technically um they're still ongoing investigations so I believe that Trump and the White House
[55:18.380 --> 55:21.980]  is aware of what's going on this is a bad within I guess you could call the deep state
[55:21.980 --> 55:25.660]  in the legitimate government because the reason that there were multiple teams there is because
[55:25.660 --> 55:28.800]  they were aware of what's going on and the reason that some of these Saudi interests
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.040]  are allowed to be there or how can they be there what's going on they have certain diplomatic
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.100]  communities and there's ongoing you know projects and missions going on but with this specific
[55:37.100 --> 55:42.780]  PMC that was they were working um you know this is pretty important and if you notice
[55:42.780 --> 55:47.100]  the timeline they you have the war within what is the White House now and all these
[55:47.100 --> 55:52.100]  you know quote-unquote intelligence agencies going on on 60 Minutes on Sunday you also
[55:52.100 --> 55:57.740]  have the Amir of Qatar coming out okay who was sanctioned by the Saudis the Bahar the
[55:57.740 --> 56:01.900]  Bahrainians and all this other stuff and we have our U.S. assets and our legitimate PMCs
[56:01.900 --> 56:07.820]  in Qatar there the Amir of Qatar talked about this this PMC that he kicked out of his own
[56:07.820 --> 56:12.460]  country and then you have the Saudis attacking him and remember three years ago Bandar Bush
[56:12.460 --> 56:16.820]  threatened the Russians for the Olympics and he threatened the EU that if they didn't go
[56:16.820 --> 56:21.620]  along with the Syria takeover by the ISIS al-Qaeda forces quote we'll launch terror
[56:21.620 --> 56:27.600]  attacks inside of your tourist zones so is this the same thing the Saudis threatened
[56:27.600 --> 56:34.380]  Russia with 100% and this is I mean sophisticated and the weirdness of it is is they have backing
[56:34.380 --> 56:39.620]  sort of I mean this quasi backing from the U.S. not to the legitimate U.S. the deep state
[56:39.620 --> 56:45.620]  Obama folks exactly this this is this is serious and I'm just going to tell you right now and
[56:45.620 --> 56:50.940]  I don't want to rattle anybody but between November 1 and November 5 PMC contractors
[56:50.940 --> 56:56.140]  are or the as far as max contracts go I mean there's a lot going on this within the next
[56:56.140 --> 57:01.780]  I don't know six days five six days there's a lot going on there's obviously active threats
[57:01.780 --> 57:05.460]  as we speak but this is a real issue because you technically can't put this stuff and televise
[57:05.460 --> 57:11.900]  it how many people you're talking to in the special operations commanding people how there
[57:11.900 --> 57:17.860]  are a few minutes left to that video and so we're going to post the full thing up on info

[57:22.300 --> 57:27.420]  or so of that we're going to start the second hour in just a moment but again the New York

[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:19.620]  to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite group is superior to government

[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:42.420]  me meet the real me in my misfits wave life dark black past my most valued possession
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:49.720]  is always 2020 ladies and gentlemen we are back live i am your host alex jones roger
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.940]  stone's plane just landed he'll be here in about 30 minutes i've got incredible congressional
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:01:01.020]  testimony by the big social media giant ceos where they try to act like they're not censoring
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.900]  pro-america and libertarian and conservative and christian and pro-veteran information
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:15.540]  and boosting anti-fund blm cop killer garbage that's coming up and then they also get put
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:20.740]  on the hot seat about the fact that they're operating monopolies but admit that actually
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:25.460]  the russians in the aggregate were not pro trump they were basically hedging their bets
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:31.000]  and then after trump won they jumped on the anti-trump bandwagon that's because there's
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.580]  a lot of ngos buying stuff in russia that then is targeted at us just like the cia will
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.480]  write stuff in foreign papers to have the lies come back here as well we don't know
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.820]  where most of this is coming from just as president trump has said but right now let's
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.900]  go ahead and go to this mark dyes report i'll play the clip in just a moment a great american
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:55.120]  happened to stumble across a live cnn shoot in manhattan yesterday and did his duty to
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.100]  god and his country to warn the people who for some reason happened to be watching cnn
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.540]  about what it was that they were actually seeing i think when the charlie hepto attacks
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.060]  if memory serves me there were there were some in some of the attacks in the urebs that
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:16.940]  we've seen if he did make contact if he did make contact with isis they will have instructed
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.220]  him not to just leave a note you really got to hand it to anderson cooper he's a pretty
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.540]  good actor he didn't even break character well the guy was just two feet away from him
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.540]  yelling that cnn was fake news of course they're on the scene where yesterday another muslim
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:35.540]  immigrant did well you know what and many are wondering if perhaps this driver was inspired
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:40.860]  by this democrat campaign ad which has recently gone viral which has even been covered on
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:47.220]  all the major media outlets because it's so despicable which depicts a republican candidate's
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:53.540]  fan ed gillespie he's the republican candidate it depicts one of his fans driving a big pickup
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:59.000]  truck and running down a bunch of minority children notice the confederate flag waving
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.980]  on the back of the truck trying to evoke the horrific tragedy in charlottesville a few months
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:08.160]  ago and it certainly is reasonable to suspect that perhaps this perpetrator had seen this
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:14.020]  ad and then decided to go and carry out exactly that kind of an attack even the far left waste
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:19.200]  of paper the washington post the washington compost was disgusted by the ad it says an
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.200]  ad that has no place in the virginia governor's race oh wait what's this political action
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.060]  committee polls controversial virginia governor ad we knew our ad would ruffle feathers they
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:34.480]  said in a statement we held up a mirror to the republican party and they don't like what
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:40.760]  they see we have decided to pull our ad at this time said crystal ball j alex president
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.680]  of the latino victory fund given the recent events of course which events are you talking
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:52.620]  about their crystal ball we will be placing other other powerful ads into rotation that
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:57.100]  highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in virginia of course they didn't
[01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:02.340]  apologize for the ad they still just blamed republicans for the ad when their ad could
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:08.260]  have very well incited this isis sympathizer to kill those people in new york yesterday
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.660]  it looks like the producers of this ad actually cast some of the actors in the wrong roles
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.200]  they did have a muslim in the ad if you'll recall who was walking home from school with
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.260]  her black friend who didn't do nothing of course when they were then chased down to
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.680]  be murdered by the evil white person driving the truck but it looks like the white person
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.280]  driving the truck and the muslim roles were flipped around in the ad because as you know
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.860]  it's muslims who 99.9 percent of the time are the ones who mow down people in vehicles
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.140]  for a lot in other news we have plenty more anti-white hate crimes which continue to be
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:45.260]  ignored by the mainstream media so let's just cover one of them now in philadelphia this
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:50.140]  black thug just approached this random white woman who was just walking along the street
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:55.860]  when he decided to kick her and then punch her knocking her out cold just for fun just

[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:08.420]  the entire antifa movement that is anti-free speech anti-america and the essence of authoritarianism
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:13.980]  refused fascism is the organization created and run by the very same lady that created
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.260]  occupy wall street we'll be talking to one of the producers zach about that in a minute
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.260]  because he made some good points during the break and i said make those on air and another
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:27.220]  one of the producers in there running the video board is matt and he was bringing up
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:35.180]  some really good points last week about this poppinopolis and how if you read the indictment
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:45.300]  they act like they've got all these goods but even the indictment admits that poppinopolis
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:50.740]  kept bringing stuff to the trump campaign about russians and every time they said no
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.580]  we have nothing to do with the russians it actually exonerates trump the only person
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:02.420]  it seems in this government not in bed with foreign governments is trump and it turns
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:07.020]  out ladies and gentlemen wait till you hear this this is mainstream news we did a video
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:15.680]  um over the weekend matt and i did breaking down the fact that the evidence points towards
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.820]  him being the mole just in the indictment well now guess what he's connected to the
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:28.420]  pp dossier from day one and if you don't think the democrats try to put plants in people's
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:34.780]  campaigns you don't know what planet you're living on this is 101 of even local politics
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:39.300]  you're running for city council they're gonna in a big city they're gonna put four or five
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:45.860]  plants in your organization if you're running for congress they're gonna try to put 20 you're
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:53.580]  a senator oh you're a president or you're running for president and you're a front runner
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:58.020]  just like this lady's a democratic operative the the russian lawyer that met with donald
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:04.020]  trump jr don junior donnie jr he's their 10-minute meeting okay you got evidence hillary's working
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:08.300]  with the russians give it to me that's what you're supposed to do as a patriot and she
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.700]  just kept trying to get into other subjects about influence and stuff he said no i'm here
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.060]  here about corruption boom i'm out of the meeting you didn't give us what you were supposed
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:26.380]  to so it's simply amazing matt let's go to you first this is really obvious what's going
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.620]  on here with good old good old poppinopolis and and of course we now know that mueller
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.340]  is very corrupt even mainstream news admits that he's like a pit bull he would falsely
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:42.120]  charge suspects wife to apply pressure he broke all sorts of laws in the constitution
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.540]  uh in in the way he supposedly got all this fake info so we know who their witness is
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:52.700]  the grand jury it's poppinopolis uh this whole thing stinks to high heaven just like fake
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:10:00.420]  informants and it's starting to unravel really quick yeah so poppinopolis um we shot a video
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:08.320]  on monday that we we broke down why we thought poppinopolis just kind of stinks as a mole
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.900]  and the reason we we thought that a few different things but yeah he was repeatedly shot down
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:18.200]  um in his attempts to try and connect the trump campaign with senior russian officials
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.800]  which also looked fishy because the senior russian official was supposedly a relative
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:31.420]  of vladimir putin meeting with a junior aide which was it turns out he wasn't even a foreign
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:38.560]  policy aide relating to russia it was he was assigned to matters involving greece um which
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.940]  actually is the origin of his surname poppinopolis it's the most common surname in greece it's
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:49.140]  like jones or smith exactly was that pronouncing it right earlier yeah poppinopolis poppinopolis
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:55.420]  something like that sounds like a really good restaurant i go to sometimes it does uh so
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:59.860]  now it comes out great names i start getting hungry i'm sorry what what really confirms
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:05.460]  our suspicions uh that we were talking about on monday in that video that we did um after
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:14.780]  the show uh is it's come out that he's now uh friends he's sergey malan the source of
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:21.220]  the steel dirty dossier that's been discredited widely discredited um turns out that poppinopolis
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:27.420]  is intimate friends with him on facebook and when i say that i mean that uh poppinopolis
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:35.360]  only has a network of 240 friends on facebook and this sergey malan uh is one of them it
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:41.700]  also turns out that they were in regular contact with one another uh additionally uh one of
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:47.740]  the things that i read about this that just looks super funny um you know it's just super
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:57.060]  suspicious when someone emails in an email thread in your uh in your campaign uh i think
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:03.700]  the the headline verbatim was uh attempt or uh set up meeting with with russian officials
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:09.580]  including putin like that just that looks suspicious it looks silly it almost looks
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.860]  sure the whole thing in fact it's worse than that the stuff they say it goes on and on
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:17.980]  we'll have influence where putin wants to back trump he's our boy the whole thing is
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:23.200]  a complete setup we know it's a setup we know that's how the swamp operates the same thing
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.780]  happened to me when i was in when i was in eighth grade i was not a drug user but i'd
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:34.900]  smoked marijuana before and they were busting lots of kids for smoking marijuana and and
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:40.940]  this one kid in the field house kept saying just buy a joint from me in the morning please
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:46.760]  buy the joint from me in the morning please and i said no well the next day he follows
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:52.500]  me in a bathroom at first period and says here please buy it and i went whoa and i took
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:56.980]  it and threw it in the toilet they still called me to the office and said we know you just
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:01.180]  bought a marijuana cigarette and i said no i threw it in the toilet your guy did it you
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:06.420]  shut him up they went are you like an organized criminal you're saying no to us who told you
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.980]  how to lie like this and i went you people are crazy and they were really mad that i've
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.020]  been in a bunch of fights and stuff and thought i was a trouble kid or whatever because i'd
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:17.220]  fight back against you know the gangs that were just going around beating up the white
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.900]  kids and that's what it was and i'm not against black people but that's what was going on
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.900]  they were racist some of them a lot of my friends were black the point was is that they
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.980]  just wanted to teach me a lesson they were uh you know white principles and they just
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.900]  got completely upset but it was so obvious you say what's that have to do with with poppinopolis
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.780]  well it's so obvious when somebody's in your organization going just please buy an illegal
[01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:42.560]  gun from me or just please buy drugs from me once or you know let's just do something
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.860]  illegal i mean it's it's very obvious i've had informants and people they don't do it
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:52.980]  anymore show a show of public events ago alex i want to bomb the police station do you agree
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.880]  we should bomb the police and and then it turns out it's some federal informant so they're
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:03.260]  incredibly dirty it's how they operate i wonder what they had on poppinopolis before or i
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:08.940]  wonder if they inserted him on purpose but he's got to know they normally burn their
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:14.540]  infiltrators at this level to discredit them in case they ever turn around and and and
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:19.260]  tell what happened i mean he's got to know his days are numbered being the bag man and
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:24.660]  the dirt man for old i mean if it's true we're just speculating here of course for old mueller
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.860]  what do you think well i think that's in the cards for him i don't know who'd want to work
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:33.020]  with this guy in the future because he just seems like a weasel at this point um the other
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:38.220]  thing that uh is interesting to note is that it's being reported that they think that he
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:44.660]  wore a wire as early as july of last year in cooperation with mueller's investigation
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:50.540]  and with these indictments that came out on monday the only thing they have is unrelated
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:58.380]  to the actual campaign again they're trying to put pressure on uh gates and manifold so
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:03.100]  yeah i mean the word is and i knew this six months ago not filing proper tax forms for
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:08.100]  offshore corporations paid the taxes just didn't follow the proper forms uh that now
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.820]  pedestrian his brother just filed a few months ago because retroactively retroactively yes
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:19.580]  retroactively he still committed the offense that's it and you know i've also been told
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.020]  they're looking into things like did junior campaign people divert funds for their own
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:31.260]  hotels or plane tickets or food i mean it's it's like they're looking for crooked toenails
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.300]  and somebody that lied about it or forgot about it and that's all they're doing all
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.820]  right great point roger stone's coming in studio bottom of the hour in studio and we're
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:46.260]  going to come back and matt's going to pop in too about who is behind uh this whole antifa

[01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:50.940]  4th and there are literally dozens of articles saying i'm insane nothing's coming november
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:55.080]  4th what is going on with these people yeah you've been paul revere on this you have been
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.440]  predicting this now literally for months based on your own sources uh i think it's it's a
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:08.400]  hysteria because uh in middle america in flyover country donald trump is very popular i was
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.740]  in washington yesterday i was able to see some proprietary polling taken by the republican
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:19.640]  national committee uh and it showed that if the election were run again tomorrow alex
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.620]  donald trump would win again he's actually marginally more popular than he was on election
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:30.580]  day the erosion is in the support for hillary clinton four out of ten clinton supporters
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:35.700]  now say that they're not sure they would vote for her again uh and the this of course is
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:41.780]  so against type so against the mainstream media narrative that they're going out of
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:46.280]  their minds it's emerging we just went over the evidence earlier i'm gonna do a special
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:51.140]  report uh tonight on this is gonna air during the war room with owen schroyer and herself
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:56.780]  just collecting all the evidence there's so much that poppinopolis was a plant from the
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:03.660]  beginning uh by the deep state by mueller wearing wires as early as july and even with
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.860]  that it's in the indictment how he kept trying to steer them into russia meetings and they
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:12.140]  didn't bite i mean if you really get into the evidence their indictment is the evidence
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:19.820]  that trump did nothing well and in fact his whole pedigree is as a neo-con as a he goes
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:24.900]  from a series of think tanks all of which like the jamestown institute the hudson institute
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:31.500]  all of them you know virulently anti-russia and then suddenly overnight who's advocating
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:37.860]  uh meetings with the russians at the highest level about this guy poppinopolis uh i am
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:43.020]  told that mannefort spotted him early oh he looked he just looks like a worm yeah no this
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:47.420]  and he was evidently wearing a wire for at least three months let me ask this what is
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.760]  the trump campaign dealing with people that look like that i mean i would i would run
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.900]  from that guy well it's important to understand i mean he looks like a ne'er-do-well uh he
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.580]  does he does look a little strange doesn't he well you know how those greeks are look
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:04.200]  at that wow we love greeks yes we do greeks i know we're good looking that guy in good
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.220]  luck spiro agnew is the one i was thinking it looks like a little jihadi or something
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:13.540]  he does look strange i i guess the point here is that in a presidential campaign when the
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:21.140]  media is beating on you for having you know no uh issue operation no no heft you put together
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:28.380]  these largely paper honorific advisory panels and they can have a hundred people on them
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:35.360]  uh but and in this case the the group that poppinopolis belonged to met one time i don't
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.700]  believe they ever met with the candidate um the guy had no authority he wasn't on the
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:47.060]  payroll he didn't even have uh a credential you know a security pass to get into the headquarters
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:52.360]  which you know general election is kind of tightly controlled so he is a marginal player
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:59.140]  to to put it uh mildly i think the that sarah huckabee nailed this uh particularly to try
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:05.700]  to now depict him as some high level trump operative is just disingenuous and expanding
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:12.760]  on this this is all they've got and then trump saying do something uh you've got them completely
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.820]  involved with russia uranium one john podesta is now making almost daily tweets saying alex
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:25.020]  jones eat sh you know what yes uh you know you're gonna get it i mean which is which
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:30.420]  is a threat but strangely enough podesta hasn't been banned on twitter you see i've been banned
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:34.740]  over allegedly threatening i'm about to say the word is you are now going to sue oh there's
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:39.140]  no question i went to washington yesterday to meet with a number of and that's twitter
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:44.620]  twitter but uh and i may be joined in this by others because our friend milo has also
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:49.020]  been uh and you know i've been going around to the lawyers we have good cases i just haven't
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:54.300]  taken the leap yet on what who i need to sue just to defend free speech but but it's amazing
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:26:00.420]  that um you know keith oberman can threaten to burn my house down with me in it but he's
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:06.420]  still on twitter uh john podesta can threaten you alex but he's still on twitter talk about
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.780]  a liberal double standard look i i'm gonna own why do you think podesta's making all
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:15.700]  these horrible statements just suddenly he hardly ever tweets and now why is he so angry
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:21.580]  at me uh it's hard to say i think he understands that his uh vulnerability is going to come
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:28.120]  to the fore here and he keeps trying to divert to pizzagate sorry i've never written spoken
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:33.560]  said anything whatsoever about pizzagate i think we concluded it was a it was a false
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.180]  and we're the ones that pointed out it was a false flag so they're trying to blame me
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:42.580]  as the progenitor but of it but just because uh pizzagate turns out to be bogus doesn't
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:48.180]  mean that the entire issue of pedophilia is false and notice that's exploded onto the
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:53.260]  scene with hollywood extraordinary what do you make of this timing the nfl hollywood
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:57.820]  it's all literally collapsing i don't think there's even forces behind the scenes doing
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:01.980]  it i just think america's waking up they're angry they're not asleep anymore and they're
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:07.980]  speaking out very interestingly that you know i came on uh the war room uh and i laid out
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:14.060]  a scenario by which the president should demand that jeff sessions appoint a special counsel
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:21.960]  to look into uranium one this would have the net effect of putting mr muller mr combi mr
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.540]  mccabe the associate director of the fbi and uh rod rosenstein the de facto attorney general
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.540]  of the united states in the hot seat where they deserve to be right immediately a piece
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:38.340]  on vanity fair yesterday headline why roger stone's plan won't work a piece on raw story

[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:50.820]  you just told us what you fear you fear this move by donald trump i think general kelly
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:56.260]  signaled it yesterday in uh his great interview with laura ingram uh i think the president
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:03.360]  uh kind of uh revealed it in his tweet saying why isn't the focus on crooked hillary this
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:09.980]  is the plan that turns the tables on the inquisitors and by the way if we weren't over the target

[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:30.920]  you the enemy knows where the resistance is coming from they know where the winning globally

[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:17.600]  so excited here but but again you're saying I've been predicting this for six months the
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:23.520]  SJW is the Antifa the communist groups have been saying we're going to launch our revolution
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:30.660]  November 4th and many of them say we're gonna kill cops we're gonna kill talk show host
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:35.960]  my security folks want me talking about the things that go on but the the issue is they're
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:41.740]  saying hashtag kill Republicans on TV Democratic strategists they're celebrating Scalise getting
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:46.100]  shot Wolf Blitzer had a guest on saying this guy was basically a hero he wasn't a bad guy
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:51.120]  shoot the Scalise and the other people I mean they mean business folks they don't just attack
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.960]  me and Roger when we walk down the street in San Francisco or Austin okay they mean
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.680]  business they want to bully us back into submission and then they say in articles every day in
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:05.560]  the last two weeks Jones is insane and claims there's some November 4th movement coming
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:12.360]  here it is full page front section New York Times that cost $100,000 boys and girls funded
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:17.280]  by George Soros at the bottom now what does that sound like to you Roger Stone well and
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:25.920]  it's not it's not coincidental that Tom Steyer is up on CNN with these ubiquitous 30-second
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.600]  TV spots attacking the president he's mentally unbalanced he's insane we can't have a man
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:37.140]  like this with his finger on the nuclear button you see that the newspaper they say we're
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:41.940]  causing a chain reaction that will drive Trump from power they say the detonation begins
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:47.000]  November 4th yeah so these but these are connected events in other words as one who has an extensive
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.400]  experience in political advertising I can tell you the newspaper ads the television
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:57.640]  ads these are all meant for a you know a symbiotic a synergistic a coordination to whip up the
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:03.400]  crazy chain reaction exactly to whip up the radicals and we're going to talk about this
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.600]  on the war room this afternoon I think the establishment has the Mueller strategy they
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.480]  laid it out for us this week the week and the indictments are building towards November
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.580]  4th right exactly and then we're talking about their fallback plan a 25th amendment plan
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:26.300]  to unhorse our president using that constitutional rubric we're going to be shedding light on
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:32.560]  this all week here at Infowars because we have incredible inside information and that's
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:38.480]  why you're here for this week because we knew the main enemy assault of their new offensive
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:43.520]  starts November 4th and folks they've even sent me letters saying surrender by November
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:48.120]  4th I'm the lawyers are looking at me going public with this tomorrow I'm going to show
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:52.780]  you this as soon as we off here unbelievable unbelievable no look I think they have a game
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:57.320]  plan guys ask David to bring over that that that that that thing from Gore please but
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:03.040]  we're going to lay this out for the info warriors plan a is the Mueller takedown if that doesn't
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:10.400]  work plan b is the 25th amendment takedown which I think is going to be in conjunction
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:18.220]  with this overall Soros Steyer funded media oh they admit it so these these are interlocking
[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:23.120]  pieces of around by the way Soros claims he spends 500 million a year on average and off
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.220]  election years of sometimes 800 million election year what does it mean that he's put 18 billion
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:32.680]  in to this foundation and says he intends to spend it just the next few years overthrowing
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:39.200]  Russia and the US I mean why is why is he walking around last night I was with a very
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:47.300]  high level Republican lobbyist with very very close ties to the Bush family and to and Jeb
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:53.720]  Bush specifically he had just had lunch with Jeb and Jeb told him confidently Trump will
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:00.000]  be gone by December Trump will be gone by December what does that tell you oh my god
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.760]  we should have started the whole show with that in fact take that clip right there no
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.320]  start over start over and we're going to put that right in front of this interview this
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.280]  is so incredible Roger folks never bluffs he's got the intel he's so Jeb Bush is saying
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:21.200]  Trump will be gone by December what is he talking about that's what he's talking about
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.720]  these ads these TV spots in a synergistic effort with a 25th amendment takedown of the
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:33.800]  president their claim is going to be well he's unbalanced he's non-compass mentis he
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:41.040]  can no longer do the job this is the overall establishment plot first they try the Mueller
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:48.280]  assault if that doesn't work they try the 25th amendment assault backed by their street
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:54.840]  demonstrations backed by the rowdies on the street demanding Donald Trump's removal so
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:01.400]  the whole concerted next wave their biggest push comes this November 4th and they are
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:07.680]  going to operate on every level lawsuits physical attacks cop killing you know out of the Soros
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.720]  funded groups I mean they think we're all what's crazy is they think the threats make
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.360]  us roll over when all it does is energize us where's their blind spot well it's interesting
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:24.120]  I would have taken the Jeb report with a bit of a grain of salt but having done the rounds
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:29.680]  in Washington yesterday I also met with another Republican lobbyist hold on stay there and

[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:42.520]  hour ago here in austin from dc with high level meetings with top advisors to the bushes
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:47.160]  the clintons you name it and that that's why they fear him he's got the contacts including
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:52.680]  the president he has just laid out during this break to me really serious info that
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:57.440]  dovetails with their plan george soros has bought a full-page ad for antifa calling for
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.520]  the overthrow of trump beginning november 4th they're all coordinating it roger stone
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.040]  please give people an intelligence report on what you just told me well alex i was in
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.400]  washington for the purpose of meeting with some of the most powerful and most knowledgeable
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:19.280]  telecommunications lawyers in the country in preparation for a lawsuit against twitter
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:27.680]  uh i heard only minutes ago that the official feed for the netflix documentary uh stone
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:35.520]  fleck uh for get me roger stone has now also been suspended um so i will own twitter before
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:41.960]  this is over there are first amendment issues there are uh there are antitrust issues torturous
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:46.960]  interference but but during the time i was in washington i never lose the opportunity
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:56.280]  to socialize and i had uh a cocktail with a very prodigious uh bush fundraiser somebody
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:05.240]  um with close personal relationships to george w to george h w uh and to jeb uh and he told
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:11.040]  me that he had seen jeb recently uh when the topic of trump came up you said that day at
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:20.040]  lunch yeah at a lunch he said jeb said confidently bush trump will be gone by december now i
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:25.240]  would normally take that with a grain of salt later in the evening i saw a very prominent
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:32.320]  republican lobbyist who had just been with a major rhino republican senator who shall
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:39.160]  remain nameless and ironically when the subject of trump came up he also said don't worry
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:47.400]  about him he'll be gone by december now i see these ads i've seen that tom steier tv
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.760]  ads steier being a kind of a junior soros by the way he's lost every election he's ever
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:59.640]  touched now you bring this in these these full-page newspaper ads and folks this ain't
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:05.160]  cheap the full page of the new york times that's 100k plus depending on what editions
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:12.000]  it ran in and i see the synergy of their political strategy they are going to run a street revolution
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.200]  against trump a revolt at the same time that's the astroturf it's the 25th amendment strategy
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:24.560]  so plan a the Mueller takedown not looking very good right now because Mueller laid out
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:31.600]  his cards and they are weak indeed if they were counting on Manafort to roll over clearly
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:38.360]  they were they dumped these charges on him i can report to the info warriors right now
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.920]  Manafort will plead not guilty and he will fight to the death he is not going to bear
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.160]  false witness against the president of the united states he is not going to make up lies
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:54.000]  about donald trump and the russians to please bob Mueller he is a fighter and he will go
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.180]  down fighting if he has to but there is zero chance that they will break his spirit or
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:04.200]  break his commitment to making america great again and taking on the globalist so i think
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:11.200]  the Mueller plan is going to fail there that moves us to the 25th amendment plan alex and
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:17.000]  this week here at info wars we're going to lay out who exactly the plotters are and what
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  their scheme is to remove the president they seek to do in the courts and through the constitution
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.840]  in a bogus proceeding what they could not do with the ballot box absolutely this is
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:35.640]  their biggest assault yet but let's remember they failed trying to steal the nomination
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:41.400]  they did steal it from sanders they failed to then keep him from getting the final nomination
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:45.720]  at the convention in cleveland that we you and i attended the rest of the crew and then
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:50.080]  they failed to get the faithless electors to stop him from being seated at the electoral
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:55.600]  college they have failed failed failed failed and now russia gate completely turns around
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.680]  as you said a year and a half ago everything they accuse trump of and you and i of hell
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:06.320]  asinine they have done no they've got the they've got the worst possible perfect storm
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:13.880]  between uranium one and the revelations about uh fusion gps and the ties first revealed
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:22.060]  here at info wars to the bush rubio republican money man paul singer uh and his henchman
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:28.460]  dan senor uh and then passed that ball on to hillary clinton as the president noted
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:36.020]  today in a tweet up to 13 million dollars now spent on this bogus narrative accusing
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:43.020]  the president of sexual indiscretions completely false completely made up they are in retreat
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:49.580]  they see the pieces coming together for their indictment uh and therefore the guy we really
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:54.960]  have to count on the guy who i think is a hero uh who i've known of for many years and
[01:52:54.960 --> 01:53:01.320]  somebody of extraordinary integrity is senator chuck grassley he is going to bust uranium
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:08.560]  one wide open and in my view it is essential to have both mueller and rosenstein in the
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:13.260]  hot seat answering questions under and that's why they're saying your plan is ridiculous
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:18.080]  because they know the president listens on pardons you name it and you've been telling
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:21.740]  him all along what was going to happen it's happened just as you said it would uh how
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:26.080]  much i could say here but the president's got to know you've been dead on well i was
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:30.840]  heartened by the fact that um general kelly in this terrific interview with laura ingram
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:35.660]  laid it out laid out the need for a special prosecutor is kelly not suddenly getting a
[01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:41.160]  lot better well and i noticed the left turned on him now the left has turned on him he clearly
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:46.520]  has figured out that the way to stay on his job is to go to the wall for donald trump
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:53.160]  donald trump is a man who rewards and appreciates loyalty and whether it is general kelly taking
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:59.900]  on the whack job congresswoman from florida with her cowboy hats or whether it is him
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:05.240]  pointing out that we need a special prosecutor here's the linchpin though alex what will
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:11.360]  jeff sessions do when the president he's the weak link it appears that way when the president
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:16.520]  orders him this isn't a suggestion jeff and the president's on tv saying do something
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:21.720]  they're in bed with the russians exactly so it does not uh it would not shock me if jeff
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:27.280]  sessions has to go he either got to follow orders and appoint a real special prosecutor
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:33.880]  let someone like like uh uh uh mike mccazy or someone like well pregg yachty's already
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:38.520]  said he wouldn't do it andrew mccarthy uh judge andrew napolitano he'd be great any
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:44.960]  of them are more than capable of doing this job we need a real fearless honest process
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:50.400]  let's boil it down we're in a mob war between a group that wants to restore the republic
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:53.520]  and not have us sell the country out in a group that thinks they own the country what
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:59.440]  about the wild card though of trump saying don't bring people in on these cultural enrichment
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:05.040]  visas that's actually what they're called folks the chuck schumer and obama put through
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:11.180]  uh seven years ago and then almost all the terror attacks we see are from the quote refugees
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:16.840]  or cultural enrichment from the very countries trump is trying to block people unvetted where
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:23.320]  folks in sudan or in somalia an imam gives you a passport who lets you cross a border
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:27.800]  and then fly out on say uh you know a kenyan airways they don't even have airports that
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:32.880]  work trump's saying he bans seven countries these are countries that don't have running
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.480]  water we have no idea who's getting on the damn planes he better block them i wonder
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:43.120]  if the people uh killed in time square feel culturally enriched today i wonder if there's
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:48.640]  going to be a seven day waiting period like we have with the old brady law on rental trucks
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.440]  because you know they had just a waiting period because you know the new york time says right
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.720]  here the truck did it you know that it's like uh christine the steven king movie or maximum
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.320]  overdrive you know where the cars come alive and kill you right here autobots transforming
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:08.480]  murder mile-long manhattan truck attack kills eight i knew it was megatron the truck had
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:13.720]  no driver evidently extraordinary extraordinary did he not yell ali akbar just before the
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:19.560]  attack the i've seen that in several media reports why won't they call the truth the
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:25.080]  truth why won't they point out that this is islamic terrorism at its worst and again listeners
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:29.420]  know this i only generally plug once an hour over the years because that could fund us
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:34.460]  and we grew uh symbiotically organically to the level we needed now's the main attack
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:38.660]  now's the war bonds you spend money with globalist it's trading with the enemy you buy products
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:44.100]  at info war store.com it is an act of total resistance to the globalist in soros and for
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:48.880]  his billions millions can counter that but we need millions because i sell high quality
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:54.020]  products at such low prices that i argue with some of my crew either in marketing i think
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:58.640]  super low prices are the way to go and people just buy more we make more i'm right kinda
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.520]  but sometimes not because then sometimes things are best sellers sometimes they're not i need
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.800]  folks to go to info war store.com and get one of you know 60 70 t-shirts to spread the
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.160]  word meet like-minded folks i need you to sign up for auto ship to get great products
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.380]  like dna force and great probiotics like biome defense and brainforce plus and a bunch of
[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:21.320]  specials that end today info war store.com or triple a 25 33139 one of my biggest stressors
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.680]  is trying to raise money to hire more crew to battle harder and fending off enemy attacks
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:31.560]  but if you flood us with cash it absolutely takes weight off us to spend time in information
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:37.900]  warfare so i'm going to say it now you want us to fight energizes flood me with greenbacks
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:42.640]  and i commit i'll go to the death but i need the money that's how i wage war flood us with
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:48.880]  money now we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:54.280]  own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through

[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:26.120]  by the way roger stone you heard it here first three days ago is considering suing twitter
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.200]  he's talking top lawyers he has a cut in their eye case of discrimination they've operated
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:35.320]  like a utility they told congress for a utility so it's google so it's facebook but now we
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:41.880]  have veritas video and internal documents across the board where if their employees
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:49.200]  say men exist they're fired i know that sounds crazy but that's how cultic it is now like
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:54.600]  robots we are the board there are no men there are no women and so he's getting ready to
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:59.760]  file a big suit milo others are probably going to join i've been looking at it but they always
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:04.560]  ban us and bring us back i've talked to lawyers we've got good cases but not as good as yours
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:09.040]  and this brings light right as they bring in this new guy to head up the federal trade
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:15.920]  commission who's an antitrust google buster and then we had the big uh executives and
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:20.560]  people that i'm going to play later after you leave testifying uh that there really
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.680]  was no russia collusion in fact the russia stuff was anti-trump yeah i know it's extraordinary
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:31.600]  that the double standard that were experienced on twitter look every single day on twitter
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:39.080]  people threatened to kill me kill my wife kill my children kill my dogs nothing happens
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:44.240]  to them they're still there keith olbermann threatens to burn people's houses down with
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.760]  them in them he drops the f-bomb constantly and attacks on the president the man is not
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:58.920]  there but still he is verified and on twitter uh today uh an antifa spokesman announces
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:06.640]  the future beheading of a number of americans still their twitter feed remains intact so
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:13.400]  it's about time uh and i have met with a number of lawyers this is very simple twitter needs
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:19.440]  to be regulated like a utility the phone company is a private company but they can't deny you
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:26.360]  a telephone this is a first amendment issue and to say oh you used obscenity really well
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:32.800]  you better look at keith oberman's feed if that's the measure um i didn't say anything
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.480]  on twitter that hasn't been said now you said don lemon is a complete idiot well i said
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:43.160]  he's a snowflake he's an imbecile he and his view again and they proved he's a snowflake
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:49.200]  you got banned but the the the claim by don lemon is that the clintons have been completely
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:56.340]  exonerated on uranium one no don they haven't stop saying that it's a lie and when you repeat
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:03.360]  a lie it makes you a liar go to your next party and knock it off will you and a separate
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:08.000]  issue then you're gonna go take a break and get ready to uh host the war room coming up
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.800]  and the fourth hour here today that i'll join you in with what do you make a pedestrian
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:17.240]  he hardly ever tweets when he does foaming at the mouth at you foaming at the mouth at
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:22.000]  me making threats uh saying i'm gonna eat you know eat crap i mean what is going on
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.960]  with him i think he's becoming unhinged you notice his brother was forced to step down
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.600]  from their extremely lucrative influence peddling operation in washington dc uh they try to
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:39.200]  divert attention to pizza gate but pizza gate's not the issue it's the art on the walls it's
[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:44.240]  the weird stuff written on your knuckles john we're on to you we know what you are and what
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.840]  you do exactly and i'm i'm saying pedessa should be investigated from what's in the
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:54.080]  wikileaks the new york times everybody diverted it to a pizza place we covered it we took
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:58.160]  the bait but we got the documents and we got the pis on the ground for six months we're
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.200]  not stupid no so look i think he's becoming unhinged because they are getting exposed
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:09.480]  their whole carefully constructed russian narrative is falling apart before their very
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:14.980]  eyes the exact thing that they were seeking to divert from the fact that they are the
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:20.160]  ones in bed you know pedessa's watching right now i hope so listen he only talks about us
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:26.400]  yeah well i i don't try to get your feed followers up just by saying my name it's ironic twitter
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:31.840]  killed me just when i hit 300 000 followers and again they do that to suppress it turned

[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:52.840]  down the hall but not the new world order you thought mike sternum which is coming up
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:56.960]  in just four or five minutes matt bracket is only popping in briefly but i want to get
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:01.040]  back on the war room and back on our show tomorrow is having some skype trouble in the
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:04.760]  last 30 minutes we're just getting a pop in from matt bracken a counterterrorism expert
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:11.200]  best-selling author former navy seal really smart guy predicting six months ago that there'd
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:18.220]  be a big antifa uprising trying to overthrow trump that they would get very very violent
[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:22.760]  they're simultaneously saying none of this exists while they're calling for it but here
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:28.680]  is the full page new york times ad calling for the total launch of a revolution on november
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:33.720]  fourth this saturday and that they are going to quote drive the president from power we
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:39.840]  just had roger stone on who met with one of the chief advisors to the bush family and
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:46.160]  others saying trump's gone by december ladies and gentlemen they're making their move it's
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:49.620]  a confidence game though because they said two months ago he'd be gone in two months
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:54.240]  so their plans behind schedule his ratings are going up he's delivering on the economy
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:08:01.760]  but just a brief snapshot matt bracken we've seen the situation while they had the saudi
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:07.360]  arabian military doing a conference and other things in vegas and more and more that's emerging
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:12.680]  as a deep state operation very sophisticated connected in different groups and then we
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:17.340]  also at the same time have this latest islamic attack yesterday killing eight people the
[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:21.340]  new york times calls a truck attack in five minutes what's on your radar what do you see
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:27.040]  happening um just for a short thing something that i haven't really heard a lot about in
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:34.360]  terms of the uh the the attack yesterday they're they never mentioned islam jihad or a lot
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:38.720]  a lot bar at the conference this morning or yesterday it's the them it's like martians
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:43.000]  we're not going to surrender to the them or the they but they're so cowardly they won't
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.420]  even say it imagine trying to fight world war ii where you can't say german or nazi
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:54.280]  you can only say uh belligerent europeans you know it's crazy but the the actual translation
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:59.800]  of allah akbar is not god is great that's a big mistake it's when they say allah who
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:05.680]  and they put the ooh on the end of allah that means greater so it means allah is greater
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:12.080]  than your god allahu akbar is our god they're saying our god our god dominates you we are
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:16.960]  defeating you we are greater than you we have conquered you that's right and and watching
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:22.340]  heraldo and these other apologists they seem to be saying that the solution is uh putting
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:26.220]  up bollards all over the place anywhere a truck can go we're going to put up bollards
[02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:34.200]  but i think we should call those things allahu ak bollards or allahu ak barriers because
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:40.000]  that's what they are in europe they call them koran blocks they put up jersey barricades
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.960]  and they put up these cement bollards they never had to do that in any other war it's
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:50.760]  because today the war is among us and you know as mad as i as i am at this terrace his
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:56.680]  name is literally uh sort of allah you know that nobody of our extreme vetting picked
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:02.680]  up on the fact that his parents named this boy sort of allah and he won the is the he
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:09.320]  won the isis lottery to come to america and bring 28 more i just heard today bring 28
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.600]  of his closest inbred family here which i'm sure they're all on welfare they're plotting
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:20.400]  more jihad attacks we pay for them everything and then they hate us because we're creative
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:26.760]  and we're not inbred yeah and as angry as i am at these at these uh crazy jihadists
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:31.600]  you know if a crazy farmer puts a fox in his chicken house and the next morning all the
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:37.400]  chickens are dead yeah the fox is just acting according to his nature you know the farmer
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:41.440]  is the one that's responsible so it's chuck schumer and these people that thought it's
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.920]  a great idea to flood the country with you know tomorrow's jihadists they're like the
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:51.000]  crazy farmer that put the fox in the chicken house the fox and the sword of islam is sort
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:57.080]  of allah he's just going by his his own nature his true nature it's this liberals believe
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:01.760]  that there's the in the what they call the magic dirt theory you take a guy who's raised
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:10.200]  for 22 years to be a devout you know islamic jihadist hate women hate gays uh hate freedom
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:15.080]  bring him to america and he's going to turn into a jeffersonian uh you know constitutional
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:20.720]  republican it's insanity and the main people that we need to point the finger at and i'm
[02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:25.680]  very glad that our president is doing it are these creeps like chuck schumer they're the
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:29.380]  fox that is putting the chicken in the henhouse that's right he headed up the program and
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:33.440]  we've shown the video of this guy after he's run over a bunch of people and jumped out
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:38.200]  of the car with his fake gun before the cops get him uh he just he just literally looks
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:43.160]  like a rabid dog you can tell when a dog's got rabies or is mentally ill kind of stumbles
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:49.680]  around and acts weird i mean he just looks like an inbred mental patient and why would
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:53.880]  they bring all these inbred mental patients in with to run around and kill us i mean i'm
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.520]  so sick of it and then to watch cnn and the new york times were to cover it up i mean
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:05.160]  did you see jake tapper call ala akbar say oh it's so beautiful yeah that's and unfortunately
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:10.560]  that's you know woven right through their religion it's it's impossible to um to take
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:15.840]  out of it and you know there's there's just no expunging it tommy robinson the brit has
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:22.280]  a great book you know uh on the on the quran why uh muslims kill for it for uh the quran
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:29.320]  you can't reform islam you know it is the ten commandments are all kill kill kill you
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:33.920]  know there's no way to take it out and so he thinks he's doing something good and then
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:39.080]  jake tapper goes it is so beautiful that's all a direct code to them saying just like
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:45.720]  we supported the arab spring at cnn we support you brother good job just make sure it's a
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:51.280]  church next time yeah the the moderate the so-called moderate muslims actually think
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:55.840]  that this guy is an idiot for blowing their cover because the smart ones think look we're
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:00.800]  we're going to win demographically we're going to win just in the war of the womb outbreeding
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:05.540]  you five to one so brother you're blowing our cover you know we know you're eager to
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:10.880]  get your 72 virgins but you're making us look bad and exposing the true aim and the way
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.600]  he runs around in circles he looks like a cockroach yeah he he didn't have the guts
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:21.080]  to actually pull a knife out and charge anybody though he just ran around with his toy guns
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:26.520]  trying for a suicide by cop i'm very glad he got shot in the gluteus maximus so he's
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:33.020]  available to uh to interview because he's going to be the poster boy for for islamism
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:37.920]  i hope that they give him a microphone and a show because he is the rabid dog of islam
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:41.440]  well matthew matt i want to get you back up on the war on today if you can because i want
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:45.660]  to get your predictions for november 4th what's coming if not tomorrow thank you so much my
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:49.720]  friend thanks all right everything got back up today because his sky pet problems for
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:52.720]  30 minutes i apologize to mike cernovich for getting him on the label hold him a little
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:58.580]  bit in the next uh segment at the bottom of the hour then we have uh stephen gern a highly
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:04.960]  decorated uh marine and then contractor for the company as it's known uh who's been speaking
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:08.880]  about the whole islamic invasion that's coming i want to get to that briefly with mike cernovich
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:13.780]  and then into november 4th because they say again we're going to kill you and attack and
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:18.360]  overthrow number fourth then they say oh it's insane when mike cernovich and alex jones
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:22.920]  and others report on it nothing's coming november 4th mike cernovich what is the point of them
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:27.500]  saying nothing's coming november 4th but then full page ads saying we're going to overthrow
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:33.640]  trump on november 4th what is going on here i mean they're so weird and unhinged and as
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:38.740]  we learned from when antifa was carrying a pedophile sign and then they go oh well we
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:43.240]  didn't even mean to carry it someone just handed it to us like wait so if somebody hands
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.720]  you a pedophile sign you're just going to carry around whatever anybody hands you they're
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:53.560]  not thinking alex that's the whole point and they're trying to say that you planted it
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:58.660]  with no proof do we know who do we know where the sign came from yeah there's zero proof
[02:14:58.660 --> 02:15:03.160]  of any of this the media is saying it's a false flag and i go okay where's your proof
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.440]  and they go well antifa wouldn't carry it and i go well they did carry it and then they
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:12.600]  go well somebody gave it to them well okay who who no proof at all but like you said
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:18.320]  yesterday now they're having to admit false flags could exist right which is a fantastic
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:23.320]  narrative win so from my perspective i don't care if it was some people maybe from 4chan
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:29.400]  or something who pranked them i don't care because we win either way yeah because no
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:32.560]  one ever stages anything even though the new cia documents came out admitted they were
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:36.680]  staging terror then mike cernovich is our guest we're going to come back get his take
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:41.080]  on november 4th what antifa is planning to launch you can see the whole coordination
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:46.280]  with the republicans as well the republican leadership is saying trump is gone in december
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.200]  now i think that's wishful thinking but they're going to do their darndest we'll be right

[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:37.200]  into the break room to get a cup of coffee and chuckie schumer was on fox news live in
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:45.920]  the senate blaming trump for new york this is the guy this is the guy that got the bill
[02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:52.200]  passed with obama he sponsored it he wrote it he's the chief sponsor of the diversity
[02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:58.360]  lottery the cultural enrichment as the eu calls it we didn't make up these sick jokes
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:03.000]  we call it cultural enrichment when they kill you know 89 people a niece and injured 280
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.680]  or whatever or all the other stuff and scream holla at bar you know run your toddler over
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:16.600]  as they run uh a chuck schumer beauty trump calls for the end of diversity visa program
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:21.880]  and then this is schumer's response we're going back to mike cernovich here it is president
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:30.360]  bush in a moment of national tragedy understood the meaning of his high office and sought
[02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:37.880]  to bring our country together president trump where is your leadership i'm calling on the
[02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:44.660]  president to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding immediately
[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:52.360]  so just last week that uh and then and then there was more i saw where he's blaming trump
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:55.520]  when they're trying to hold up budgets i mean this is just total deception what do you make
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:22:02.440]  of this mike cernovich yeah trump though is doing deals with schumer um right that that's
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:06.400]  what cracks me up is the people who are meanest to trump are the people who seem to get his
[02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:11.340]  attention but then when you and i ever criticize trump they go oh you know jones and cernovich
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:15.240]  are betraying us like no that's how schumer you have to to get anything with trump you
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:19.880]  have to negotiate and that's what schumer is doing and that's who trump actually listens
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:26.620]  to and does deals to so that that's interesting schumer's doing that i found out from someone
[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:31.060]  directly that that one video the night before the debate or two nights before i said you
[02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:36.120]  attack or it's over and you're a joke and he was on the fence whether he was going to
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:40.040]  attack or not and i'm told that video pushed him over the edge of me screaming at him so
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.200]  is that the answer here cernovich yeah you have to push back i i did a video where i
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:49.900]  said there's all this violence against trump supporters he won't call it out therefore
[02:22:49.900 --> 02:22:55.780]  trump is okay with antifa violence against trump supporters a day or two later at that
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:23:01.640]  rally in arizona trump finally for the first time called out antifa so people go oh you
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:06.620]  know cernovich jones you guys are on and off the trump train no let the professionals do
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:12.220]  our jobs we know what we're doing we're reminding trump that hey this is an ongoing negotiation
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:16.540]  you're just not going to steamroll us and we see again chuck schumer gets great deals
[02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:21.700]  out of trump because trump does not respond well to weak people into weakness he only
[02:23:21.700 --> 02:23:26.780]  responds well to people who negotiate back very aggressively exactly instead of me just
[02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:30.700]  directing the conversation you've always got big stuff in the in the frying pan and also
[02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:36.780]  stuff on the back burner what's other big news in planet cernovich well vanity fair has come
[02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:42.660]  out with stories that roger stone of course is broken you have broken i broken where trump
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:48.660]  realizes what a disaster jared kushner is big write-up in vanity fair about the bad
[02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:54.220]  advice from kushner to fire general flint that was the biggest mistake of trump's presidency
[02:23:54.220 --> 02:24:01.820]  firing james combi that was a kushner idea too so the white house coup is at a how do
[02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:06.220]  you want to it's been paused because general kelly is now tagged into the culture war so
[02:24:06.220 --> 02:24:12.460]  general kelly has said privately to trump i know people who are familiar with the conversation
[02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:16.300]  that now i understand why you're always hitting back because once it went after general kelly
[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:21.540]  when he was very very classy very distinguished goals our father he said oh wait so this is
[02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:25.620]  what it's like to be attacked over nothing they're fabricating things they're lying about
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:31.020]  me so kelly said i understand trump your tweets and i you know that was my next question man
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:35.740]  you're always on target kelly really is gotten better now after they attacked him and his
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:40.980]  family and is now and now the left's totally turned on him uh so so that's good to know
[02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:47.620]  now kelly understands exactly so that is again trump's twitter has been much more effective
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:53.060]  now the rhetoric isn't quite as fiery or hot but he's tweeting more often now this comms
[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:56.900]  team is doing actually a better job of twitter so so what got kelly to finally wake up i
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:00.780]  mean just the attacks on trump lying about him and how he handled the phone calls or
[02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:07.340]  what yeah the way they politicized the death of his son for kelly that was the red line
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:10.900]  kelly was devastated by the death of it i mean anybody would be devastated by the death
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:15.480]  of a child and the way the media politicized the death and he took it personal because
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:20.460]  trump was saying exactly what kelly wrote for him to say kelly took that really personal
[02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:24.900]  yeah and then the media is going after him now and attacking him and kelly realizes oh
[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:31.580]  wait these people fabricate information they they are liars right they they are liars they
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:36.240]  are fabricators and kelly now understands that you have to be aggressive you have to
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:39.060]  go on the attack all just like trump said in the press conference last week he goes
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:44.760]  people are finally getting i have to punch back yeah so kelly's great now kelly goes
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:49.580]  on tv he's talking about the civil war and now they're trying to say oh do you support
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:55.660]  slavery and so general kelly remember this is an honorable man i i don't claim to be
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:59.620]  the most you know i'm a very flawed human being i'm not a man like general kelly general
[02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:04.380]  kelly is the kind of person who would have been a roman senator the kind of person who
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:08.300]  would have been beloved by historians for throughout his life he's what you would consider
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:13.780]  the best of america and the best of american values and now he realizes well wait a minute
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:17.780]  they're fabricating things about me now they're saying general kelly likes slavery they're
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:22.260]  they're making fun of his son's death they're they're denigrating him denigrating a service
[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:26.500]  he's realizing he's been compartmentalized inside the military honorable people he doesn't
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:31.860]  understand the scum we're dealing with and now he's having to wake up to the literal
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:38.060]  zombie scum attack and now he realizes why we all go so hard that was why he kept our
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:41.780]  articles kind of away for the president because he didn't understand they're like well you
[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:46.860]  you know he had said we're all too aggressive and we shouldn't be so divisive you and i
[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:52.420]  we're under total attack unite america we want to bring americans together the media
[02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:58.100]  won't let us the media divides they're using divide and conquer tactics hate rhetoric terrorist
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:02.540]  rhetoric apologizing for terrorism telling people we need to have more terrorism look
[02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:06.460]  the other way about terrorism look the other way as they did for three decades about the
[02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:10.980]  rape and pedophilia in hollywood they're attacking cory feldman barbara walters attacked
[02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:17.100]  cory feldman that was my next question mainstream headlines hollywood accusers harassers molesters
[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:23.340]  rapists the accounts at 56 now confirmed racist or rapists and molesters i mean this whole
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:27.660]  thing's coming down quicker than i thought but what are the unforeseen blowback from
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:35.900]  this well you and i and we can pull that footage up you and i said that harvey weinstein was
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:43.020]  given to the media as a sacrificial lamb as a distraction from the pedophilia stuff and
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:47.100]  then that was their ruse that's why they gave the media harvey weinstein because the media
[02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:51.300]  didn't want to cover the pedophilia but the pedophilia stuff is coming out now that was
[02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:55.580]  a it was going to come out one way or another so i predicted that there was going to be
[02:27:55.580 --> 02:28:02.180]  a major pedophile pedophile scandal then you have kevin kevin spacey and by the way everybody
[02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:07.540]  always told me was a boy raper basically i mean i mean i had the makers of a major film
[02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:10.900]  here we were like let's not get into it because he's not in the film but yeah the word is
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:16.260]  kevin spacey's kind of a kingpin yeah exactly and now what i find interesting is that the
[02:28:16.260 --> 02:28:21.660]  fake news media will not interview the filmmaker about hollywood pedophilia so the filmmaker
[02:28:21.660 --> 02:28:27.180]  is going on rt to talk about it and then people go why do people go on rt well because why
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:32.420]  won't the media tell the truth about hollywood pedophilia unbelievable let me ask you about
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:36.700]  november 4th when they kicked this thing off i actually my lawyers want me to get into
[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:42.860]  it but i mean literally al gore uh his whole deal like telling me i better roll over by

[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:12.460]  it i guess it's kind of bittersweet he's alive wish he was dead but i'm glad he's alive the
[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:18.980]  other side's getting information but the islam is definitely dovetailed with antifa george
[02:34:18.980 --> 02:34:24.380]  soros and refused fascism same group that set up the occupied wall street as my producers
[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:28.780]  were pointing out says the nightmare must end the trump pence regime must go november
[02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:35.140]  fourth it begins be there join with thousands who will gather in cities and towns across
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:39.220]  the country a movement of protest that continue every day and night growing until we become
[02:34:39.220 --> 02:34:45.820]  millions determined not to stop until the regime is driven from power this is the soros
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:53.260]  astroturf to line up with the neo-cons and the rhinos and the democrats saying by december
[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:57.780]  he will be gone and roger stone was in dc yesterday i've got all the names the info
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:02.140]  the republicans are saying yeah that the trump's gone in december yeah and he wasn't gonna
[02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:05.860]  get the nomination either and then he wasn't gonna get seated either mike cernovich what
[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:10.820]  is your intel on this is this just them with all their threats and all their november fourth
[02:35:10.820 --> 02:35:14.460]  threats you told me you've gotten some of the same legal threats now i guess everybody's
[02:35:14.460 --> 02:35:18.300]  getting them are they just seeing who they can intimidate or what is the point of this
[02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:22.020]  because all it's done has got me in pure fighting mode i mean they're walking on the fighting
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:31.380]  side of me yeah they banned roger stone maliciously and without permanently right and they can
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:37.100]  only push this so far they've lost every time they use their little alt-right sab saboteurs
[02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:42.680]  people to end our march on google but now that that's over we'll just have a big march
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:45.920]  that we can have big marches we can bring a lot of people and it shows how weak they
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:50.740]  are they were so afraid of your google march yeah exactly we were going to do a march on
[02:35:50.740 --> 02:35:56.460]  google and then they used fed fed embeds with these alt-right morons in charlottesville and
[02:35:56.460 --> 02:36:01.060]  then next thing you know who by the way are admitted obama uh of occupy wall street they
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:05.460]  three of them were formally funded by the occupy wall street that's now refused fascism
[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:11.060]  i mean it's totally obvious they're all little pretty boy strumpet leftists who think they're
[02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:17.020]  smart enough to fall flag us exactly and then the next week we were supposed to have a march
[02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:21.840]  on google the fake news media they lied about it and claimed as a white nationalist rally
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:26.500]  was nothing of the sort so the media was able to kill that with their false flag terrorist
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:32.740]  attack but the the demand is there the people are there the people want to do it they can
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:37.700]  only push us so far and these frivolous lawsuit threats these attacks on the integrity of
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:43.020]  the people the violence the pedophilia the the rape coming out of hollywood people are
[02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:48.620]  done with it and they need to be very very careful who they're pushing around exactly
[02:36:48.620 --> 02:36:56.820]  and everybody knows this but we got to be strategic about it but they're going to counter
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:03.680]  strike but historically gut level everything humanity wants to be free and authoritarianism
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:07.460]  is coming crashing down they had america and the rest of the world kind of mesmerized by
[02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:12.380]  television and mainstream media for a while but now people are coming out of the trance
[02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:16.200]  doesn't mean they're left wing right wing christian not christian any of that just means
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:21.380]  common sense they recognize lies they see a fraud they see globalism for what it is
[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:26.620]  and i i just can't believe how the arrogance of hillary are they actually that arrogant
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:33.120]  pedestal or is that their con man game where they act so confident because man i mean we've
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:37.540]  gone from turning the tide to ripping their arms out of their sockets politically now
[02:37:37.540 --> 02:37:44.020]  now this is like a stampede over them i mean this is epic yeah they're drunk with power
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:49.380]  tony podeska of all people threatening to sue tucker carlson my god i wish tony podeska
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:54.120]  would threaten to sue me i want to talk about that subterranean basement where he watches

[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:10.580]  the washington post reported because they did a puff piece on tony podeska that's how
[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:14.020]  gross these people were they they got away with it for years and see i'm not matthew
[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:21.420]  velli but once they do it i am when when the media made up pizza gate off of the emails
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:25.020]  that were there with wikileaks that need to be investigated diverted to the pizza place
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:29.460]  we cover what the media was covering we said hey this is bull they took us being moral
[02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:34.580]  as that we were weak and then tried to frame us for the whole story but i actually seriously
[02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:39.460]  now it's almost like i didn't do it on purpose but like a setup because now i realize in
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:44.380]  the mackie valley level i get Podesta his brother his brother is saying i like dangerous
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:49.860]  art i watch it in a dungeon it's it's naked little kids here's my neighbor kids with their
[02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:54.460]  butts paddled red and i mean i'm like how does the washington post publish images of
[02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:59.980]  the little kids butts and but that was 2007 though when they just thought they'd throw
[02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:03.980]  it in our face cernovich and then i'm thinking why am i scared of these people bring it on
[02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:10.700]  let's go you know what well yeah that's the whole issue that's why i i've never apologized
[02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:14.500]  i always double down because they do view because they're you got to remember they're
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:20.320]  satanic people they're demonic people they're used to abusing and exploiting the vulnerable
[02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:24.140]  you cannot show them any weakness because you and i are good if if i do something wrong
[02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:27.580]  do you all say hey alex you know i didn't realize that my apologies you don't say apology
[02:39:27.580 --> 02:39:32.820]  accepted this isn't how they live they go oh wait you apologized you must be a moral
[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:37.300]  person maybe you're a christian now i'm really going to go in on you now i'm really going
[02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:41.780]  to try to destroy you they take your humanity as weakness like one time actually gave it

[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:49.860]  you said hey that's okay but it was you didn't take it like a power over me but exactly that's
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:55.220]  how they are yeah i even forgot that even happened but again yeah i never even brought
[02:39:55.220 --> 02:40:00.740]  it up ever again you just realized that's life but that's because i have more of a higher
[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:06.380]  set of values where i'll accept an apology but these demonic satanic people in dc the
[02:40:06.380 --> 02:40:10.380]  people like the podeskas who have no integrity spirit cooking let's talk about the spirit
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:14.640]  cooking john podeska oh yeah ladies and gentlemen of the jury here they are at an alister crowley

[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:09.060]  it but maybe they need to learn what discovery looks like maybe maybe they need to realize
[02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:14.860]  that okay once you sue somebody and if you're suing them for defaming your so-called character

[02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:15.260]  in the face of their wannabe dictatorship being a conservative a nationalist a libertarian
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:21.660]  or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counter culture the real punk rock is
[02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:28.700]  being a patriot who's pro america pro capitalism and pro freedom who at the same time is tolerant
[02:46:28.700 --> 02:46:34.300]  modern liberalism is a counterfeit of thomas jefferson's classical liberalism they are

[02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:33.660]  i'm just a common sense guy that isn't gonna take it lying down i know you're not taking
[02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:43.260]  it lying down either but all these islamists running around shooting killing stabbing and
[02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:49.460]  running people over every couple days in the western world is just a symptom the cold sore
[02:47:49.460 --> 02:47:53.180]  rising to the top of the underlying illness of the leftists and the globalists and what
[02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:58.720]  they're doing why would europe bring in 10 million islamists unfettered 80% of military
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:04.200]  aged men because they say at the un they want to break up the christian society the pope
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:10.100]  says it i mean this is a globalist takeover of every institution that pope's not a catholic
[02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:17.500]  and most catholics know that so this is an incredible time to be alive and the left and
[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:21.700]  antifa and george soros with full page ads the new york times say they're launching it
[02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:27.020]  november 4th all over the country we're i should plug we're going to be live uh from
[02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:35.580]  11 a.m until 8 p.m saturday info wars.com forward slash show on our own feeds is written
[02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:39.540]  censored on facebook and twitter and youtube those stations want to pick it up they're
[02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:42.980]  welcome to but it's going to be basically commercial free we'll air some breaks but
[02:48:42.980 --> 02:48:46.980]  they won't be set breaks and we're going to reporters out in the field and different parts
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:51.540]  of the country but this is a full launch and they're calling for cop killing i mean it
[02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:58.100]  says right here overthrow the government and drive trump from power and they have threatened
[02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:02.500]  us i mean i'm not at liberty to get into it right now because obviously there's a lot
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:10.740]  of reasons not to but i've been given ultimatums to surrender by saturday you know when i'm
[02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:14.500]  tired i get these threats i suddenly have energy and i mean i don't get why they think
[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:20.220]  these threats are going to work but i guess they work on some people uh they didn't work
[02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:26.020]  on stephen gern who was reaching 40 something million people in his first video just saying
[02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:30.080]  hey i've been training over here and training the muslims to defend their own countries
[02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:34.360]  almost all of them want to kill us we shouldn't be here this is insane and there is no such
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.220]  thing as you know a moderate uh this is a joke and then they basically kicked him out
[02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:44.220]  of his contracting work leading large teams but he's here now doing great with his own
[02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:48.100]  entrepreneurial operations and speaking out and not being censored and that's what it's
[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:52.820]  all about but understand the fight is now folks this is the second american revolution
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:57.740]  they want it to be a civil war uh but uh thank you uh stephen gern you were here just a few
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:05.460]  days ago and now another jihadi ala akbar or or our god is greater than yours attack
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:11.780]  yeah exactly um you know obviously i was on my way to florida yesterday and got into florida
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:16.580]  was on my way to the uh hotel and as soon as i get to the hotel i see what's happened
[02:50:16.580 --> 02:50:21.320]  uh the funny thing about it is about a month and a half ago i was on the jesse waters show
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:25.300]  and that's exactly what i said it's exact what they were doing in spain what they were
[02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:29.160]  doing in eu what they were doing in france this was all how they were perfecting their
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:33.460]  tactics so they could come here to the united states and do it now obviously we want to
[02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:37.140]  talk about gun control we want to talk about all this craziness well let me tell you something
[02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:41.300]  they didn't use a gun this time what he had a paint but a paint gun and a pellet gun and
[02:50:41.300 --> 02:50:45.620]  i don't understand why that uh officer didn't you know shoot to kill but obviously that
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:50.340]  that that's not my gig i'm glad that he actually didn't so now we can interrogate this individual
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:54.220]  if we're going to even be able to interrogate them i doubt we will because there's so many
[02:50:54.220 --> 02:50:57.660]  bleeding hearts out there that we're not even going to be able to properly interrogate this
[02:50:57.660 --> 02:51:02.940]  individual but you know this seems to be something that it's happened here in the united states
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:08.140]  before it's happened all over the eu and it's going to continue to happen and unless we
[02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:12.580]  don't start doing what we need to do with proper vetting just like president donald
[02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:16.820]  trump said in the very beginning we are going to see a lot more of this because they are
[02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:21.540]  paving the road to allow this to happen in the united states and the left not accepting
[02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:27.180]  what's actually happening here and the people who just don't want to accept that this is
[02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:32.180]  this is not the norm i heard yesterday on fox news an individual say we need to accept
[02:51:32.180 --> 02:51:36.140]  this as the norm no we don't need to accept this as the norm they accepted it as the norm
[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:39.860]  in the uk and you see what's happened to their country it cannot happen here in the united
[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:43.140]  states and it will not happen in the united states the only people who can stop that are
[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:47.740]  people like you and me who want to put a stand we want to stand and put a stop to what's
[02:51:47.740 --> 02:51:51.620]  happening here if our if our officials if our elected officials aren't going to do it
[02:51:51.620 --> 02:51:58.260]  we need to do it here right here on our level on the local and the state levels absolutely
[02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:04.300]  and almost all these guys are inbred they wear these these women's nightgowns they just
[02:52:04.300 --> 02:52:08.660]  wander around on welfare all day and then they just tell us how they're elite and we're
[02:52:08.660 --> 02:52:13.340]  scum and then kill us and we're supposed to bow down to this guy who brought in 28 of
[02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:19.260]  his rat-like family it's unbelievable and what's happening they're being attached to
[02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:23.940]  a visa program this is this is what it all comes down to again here we are with the vetting
[02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:30.340]  they're coming in on a visa a program which is like a lottery is what they call it the
[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:34.380]  lottery and it's and it's and it's bs it's complete and you know what it is it's like
[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:39.540]  logan's run it's a death lottery for us and like you said khan the islamist mayor of london
[02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:43.060]  keeps saying get used to it get used to it accepted don't even put it in the news they
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:49.200]  want us to accept them coming in and us bowing to them and then murdering us exactly there
[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:54.180]  is no acceptance of this it's just like you know in in islam and sharia law there is no
[02:52:54.180 --> 02:52:58.820]  acceptance there is no tolerance there you're either sharia compliant or you're not sharia
[02:52:58.820 --> 02:53:03.060]  compliant and you're either in submission to their god because as they point out you
[02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:07.060]  know arabic brother 9 he didn't say Allah Akbar he said our god is greater what's the
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:13.520]  difference well Allah Akbar it means you know god is great but but usually what you'll see
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:16.820]  is they'll see you'll see people coming up and they're doing the whole number one sign
[02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:20.420]  it's not a number one sign what he's doing is pointing up to Allah that Allah is the
[02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:23.780]  greatest and that and that's exactly what it is and that's their thought process he
[02:53:23.780 --> 02:53:27.860]  was what we would call sharia compliant and and we were talking about this as a matter
[02:53:27.860 --> 02:53:31.380]  of fact that jesse water show he had said something to me and i wanted to go ahead and
[02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:37.940]  clarify it if you are sharia compliant okay if you are sharia compliant muslim this is
[02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:43.220]  what you want to do this is jihad what he did is committed jihad and that is how they
[02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:48.620]  win that is that is like the the lottery for them to commit jihad that is the ultimate
[02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:53.940]  so that's what he has done he committed jihad and that's where we are right now this this
[02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:59.060]  is what's happening and we sure what do you make from your sources and we've got our sources
[02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:05.380]  but it's them they say they're going to launch all sorts of hell come this saturday and we're
[02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:10.120]  already seeing i think this is a tremor for more of this kind of comes we see islamists
[02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:16.980]  and isis coordinating with the black lives matter uh and and with the antifa yeah and
[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:20.900]  this is what we were talking about you know earlier about the marxist movement this is
[02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:24.900]  this is two groups or three groups of people one on one side one on the other side moving
[02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:31.300]  parallel against what we believe in against our constitution try and destroy our constitution
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:37.220]  our constitution is the longest lasting constitution in the world and we must maintain that we
[02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:42.340]  must continue to fight for it and the people who don't want to do it like like antifa you
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:47.820]  know i don't think the islamic state has anything to do with what antifa in in black lives matter
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:52.900]  is but they are able to piggyback off of what is happening and you got your george right
[02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:56.600]  because all the groups think they're going to end up in charge so the the the enemy of
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:55:01.380]  my enemies my friend another islamic sting you're exactly right and that's all they're
[02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:04.940]  doing they're piggybacking off it they're seeing that what they're doing is actually
[02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:09.620]  creating these you know ripples in the water as you can see and they're piggybacking off
[02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:14.520]  it and this is a huge problem so it isn't just about stopping the muslim brotherhood
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:20.900]  antifa black lives matter and you know islamic state we need to stop them all we need to
[02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:26.540]  stop them all and we need to have solid policies to do it and you know i'm not even worried
[02:55:26.540 --> 02:55:30.980]  about policies at this point you know i said something about you know the uh this the the
[02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:35.300]  suit wearing jihadas versus the pajama wearing behind his g jihadas we got to worry about
[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:40.020]  them all but and that's the thing they know they have missions they know they're committed
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:45.540]  they admit it and and and so we have to be just as committed to stop playing games people
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:50.020]  think oh that's a bunch of work no we have to have purpose-driven lives ladies and gentlemen
[02:55:50.020 --> 02:55:54.960]  like our ancestors did this is the animating contest of liberty this is what let me guess
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:00.860]  i bet you're even happier after 20 years overseas uh now you're really home in the real republic
[02:56:00.860 --> 02:56:05.260]  in the homeland when the fight's key i mean i mean let me guess are you happier now back
[02:56:05.260 --> 02:56:11.140]  home even with them persecuting you standing up for what's right you want to know what
[02:56:11.140 --> 02:56:16.180]  at least over there i knew who my enemy was i knew exactly who it was i knew exactly what
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:20.980]  i needed to do here the lines are so blurry and every time you turn around you call somebody
[02:56:20.980 --> 02:56:26.180]  islamic terrorist or you say that it was terrorism or you say muslim or anything like that you're
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:29.660]  the one who's persecuted for it no i understand it's harder in some ways because it's just
[02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:36.000]  the fog of of complexity and war uh geopolitical war political war but i'm saying is it fulfilling
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:41.420]  to now be reaching tens of millions of people every week though it is it's very it's very
[02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:46.300]  fulfilling i hope i can reach a lot more people and you know this is just it's just the start
[02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:49.580]  and it shouldn't be the start we should never have got to the point where we are but the

[02:59:48.020 --> 03:00:16.740]  Alex Jones show and the resistance is in your mind to Hollywood the globalist all of it and
[03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:23.020]  for all my foibles I am passionate I am upset I am angry I'm territorial I've studied history
[03:00:23.020 --> 03:00:28.900]  and I see we're being conquered by a bunch of globalist opportunists but I see Hollywood their
[03:00:28.900 --> 03:00:34.660]  whole system falling apart but I wonder how do they think they're gonna bring in millions
[03:00:34.660 --> 03:00:38.140]  I mean there's just Muslim refugees all over Austin they weren't here five years ago it's just
[03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:43.580]  everywhere New York London you think it's like an Islamic city and then my thing is they're rude
[03:00:43.580 --> 03:00:47.860]  to you they're mad at you once they become the dominant group they're not accepting they kill
[03:00:47.860 --> 03:00:53.260]  gay people they enslave women and you're not supposed to say that then the left-soul Jake
[03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:59.500]  Tapper you know said oh beautiful God is greater God is great it's so beautiful when that when it
[03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:02.940]  was reported that the guy was screaming Allah Akbar I already played the clip five times I'm
[03:01:02.940 --> 03:01:07.820]  gonna play it again and it's like what a sick freak but no he thinks that's his muscle they
[03:01:07.820 --> 03:01:14.220]  see Jake Tapper is a psychopath he takes us being nice as weak he sees Muslims willing to kill
[03:01:14.220 --> 03:01:20.300]  people as strong he wants to cozy up as a sycophantic piece of crap am I accurate in
[03:01:20.300 --> 03:01:30.140]  saying that or is that a is that an over oversimplification mr. mr. Gern no I think you're
[03:01:30.140 --> 03:01:34.500]  accurate in saying it you know really what I'm what I'm seeing here is you know people people
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:39.340]  think that oh these guys are doing what's right and what they're supposed to be doing what they're
[03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:45.940]  supposed to be doing well in a way you know in the in Islam they are doing exactly what they're
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:51.500]  supposed to be doing for this guy to say it was beautiful and and I really I really don't get it
[03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:58.060]  and that's really what I'm what I'm having a hard time with now is that people like this individual
[03:01:58.060 --> 03:02:02.420]  are accepting of what's happening here we saw what happened in the EU we see what's happening
[03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:08.700]  all over in the UK there's no talking point accept it and say it's beautiful as a good cuck
[03:02:08.700 --> 03:02:17.140]  Stockholm syndrome person like Tapper I know I heard it last night and I just yeah I guess I
[03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:22.940]  guess so mad it was in it was unbelievable to hear somebody say this is we need to accept this
[03:02:22.940 --> 03:02:28.220]  as the norm accept this as a norm no this isn't the norm and this isn't what we need to be accepting
[03:02:28.220 --> 03:02:34.260]  at all not one bit we are America and we believe in our rights we believe in our Constitution and
[03:02:34.260 --> 03:02:38.900]  we need a hold to it and anybody who doesn't believe in that I'm sorry to say but you need
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:42.300]  to go someplace else because that's not the way it runs here in the United States and Stephen
[03:02:42.300 --> 03:02:48.780]  Gern it's a formula they're trying to get us like Sweden to go under mass Stockholm syndrome they
[03:02:48.780 --> 03:02:53.420]  know what they're doing if they can get us to accept Muslims murdering us with enjoyment with
[03:02:53.420 --> 03:02:57.900]  knives guns and trucks then I guess we'll put up with anything and that's like namble is out
[03:02:57.900 --> 03:03:04.980]  saying give us your kids now yeah it is and again you know here we are if we're not if we're not
[03:03:04.980 --> 03:03:09.540]  willing to fight then we will fall that's all there is to it if we're not willing to fight well
[03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:13.020]  I want to fight what do I do I'm trying as hard as I can to spread the word what else can I do
[03:03:13.020 --> 03:03:19.940]  because I mean I'll be honest with you sometimes I just I just I just can't put much more you know
[03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:24.300]  what this is this is what I think okay first of all I think we need to go to our local law
[03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:29.300]  enforcement our local state our local councils and we need to start informing them we need it
[03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:35.300]  we need to inform them we need to get them educated on what the threat is there's a company
[03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:41.460]  actually it's an organization called understanding the threat and they are 100% dedicated to and
[03:03:41.460 --> 03:03:48.660]  Frank Gaffney with the Center of Security Policy let's get him on yeah absolutely is dedicated to
[03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:55.460]  informing people of what this threat is and what they're capable of and how they're infiltrating
[03:03:55.460 --> 03:04:03.300]  us in the United States and yes what we saw yesterday was a act of jihad although how we
[03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:10.780]  allowing this to happen is because we are losing on a lot of fronts when it comes to the pull it is
[03:04:10.780 --> 03:04:18.020]  that I won't say the political but the the policy side of the house because you have people like
[03:04:18.020 --> 03:04:22.500]  we're not people but organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood who have infiltrated our government
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:25.900]  you know this is a short segment stay there do one more with us and Roger Stone's joining us
[03:04:25.900 --> 03:04:30.100]  because I want you to come in it's been like five minutes on understanding the threat because I was
[03:04:30.100 --> 03:04:36.420]  even you know a tolerant guy I was never pro-islam but I I still bought into some of the let's be
[03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:40.820]  nice stuff maybe they'll listen that's that's just taking his weakness folks and sure you got
[03:04:40.820 --> 03:04:45.260]  Muslims that are slave to other Muslims who mean well and aren't bad people but any practicing
[03:04:45.260 --> 03:04:50.020]  Sharia compliant person you're gonna submit or they're gonna kill you and they're just waiting

[03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:16.380]  funded by George Soros who brings in the Islamic system Wow so finishing up you were getting into
[03:07:16.380 --> 03:07:21.860]  what do we do I agree we've got to go out and speak out we've got to go out to city councils
[03:07:21.860 --> 03:07:27.180]  everywhere and say the politically incorrect things to break their will they want to scare
[03:07:27.180 --> 03:07:34.580]  everybody else they're not having free speech we have to exercise it up front so that others who
[03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:38.860]  are more timid have the courage this is an information war so recap what you were saying
[03:07:38.860 --> 03:07:45.220]  Stephen Gern what I'm saying is in order for us to fight this we need to be able we're not going
[03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:48.340]  to be able to do it on the big government level it's just not gonna happen because they don't want
[03:07:48.340 --> 03:07:52.660]  to accept it what we need to do is we need to go to our local law enforcement our local magistrates
[03:07:52.660 --> 03:07:57.220]  where our local councils and so on and so forth our local churches we need to go out there and we
[03:07:57.220 --> 03:08:01.060]  need to educate these people the people who don't want to be educated people don't want to accept
[03:08:01.060 --> 03:08:05.540]  what we have to say we don't waste time on there's no reason to waste time on them I'm not gonna beg
[03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:10.180]  somebody to understand what's happening here I'm gonna point out the things that are actually
[03:08:10.180 --> 03:08:16.580]  effective and how we can do to stop this you know penetrating force that we currently have and by
[03:08:16.580 --> 03:08:22.340]  doing that you're gonna be able to bring on you basically you're putting together an army in in
[03:08:22.340 --> 03:08:28.100]  understanding the threat understanding what exactly is going on here in the United States
[03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:34.340]  and until we understand that until we educate the the the younger generations until we you
[03:08:34.340 --> 03:08:41.300]  know educate ourselves to understand what Islam is what you know Islamic law is all about and
[03:08:41.300 --> 03:08:47.660]  what they're asking us or telling us or making us do we can't if we don't identify this threat how
[03:08:47.660 --> 03:08:52.340]  can you fight it the first thing you do in any war is identify your threat and we're not identifying
[03:08:52.340 --> 03:08:56.860]  it we're still not the Obama Obama he never identified it and just so you just said right
[03:08:56.860 --> 03:09:01.260]  there they didn't identify the threat they said it was a truck that drove through negative it
[03:09:01.260 --> 03:09:06.300]  wasn't a truck that drove through it was an Islamic terrorist act that's what it was it was
[03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:13.780]  an act of jihadism and if you want to know who's in charge it's who you can't criticize to think
[03:09:13.780 --> 03:09:19.460]  about this to see the persecution of people that talk about it when the biggest victims of Islam
[03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:23.620]  are the people living in Islamic countries spend a minute on that and all the countries you've
[03:09:23.620 --> 03:09:29.700]  been in how these people live how women are treated well it's unbelievable I mean those
[03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:35.340]  few women is they don't even exist okay I mean I remember going over there you know my very first
[03:09:35.340 --> 03:09:39.020]  time and the women are in the back of the trucks while the men are driving in the front and they're
[03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:44.340]  out there you know doing everything so the women it doesn't exist at all there is no women's rights
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:51.220]  whatsoever so anybody who believes that there is there's just not it doesn't matter they kill each
[03:09:51.220 --> 03:09:56.900]  other in mass numbers in mass numbers they talk about you know what what America has done just
[03:09:56.900 --> 03:10:01.700]  look at what happens in Iraq every day in Baghdad you know vehicle bombs going off killing a hundred
[03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:05.940]  people it's the norm it's the normal over there and it can't be the norm here and that's the
[03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:11.420]  problem is people aren't seeing that the people are just evil they don't care about anything and
[03:10:11.420 --> 03:10:17.220]  maybe the reason why this this group of people are killed because they were Sunni and they were
[03:10:17.220 --> 03:10:22.980]  in Shia or this Shia is killing a Sunni it just it's not ever gonna end I mean they're gonna kill
[03:10:22.980 --> 03:10:28.100]  each other and they're definitely gonna kill us because and why would we export tens of millions
[03:10:28.100 --> 03:10:34.780]  from the very worst poorest backwards bloodbath countries of inbred insanity why what is the end
[03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:43.820]  game I can't figure out what the end game is I'm trying to figure that out in such a way just it
[03:10:43.820 --> 03:10:49.780]  baffles me that the left hates America and hates Christianity and is ugly and they and it's a form
[03:10:49.780 --> 03:10:54.820]  of cucking they want just like devil worshipers want to sacrifice a child to be bad this is just
[03:10:54.820 --> 03:11:01.780]  an act of nastiness you're right it is I mean it just seems like the left is all about destroying
[03:11:01.780 --> 03:11:08.020]  everything that we're about whether it's Christianity whether it's you know you know the
[03:11:08.020 --> 03:11:14.340]  the Constitution whatever it is it's just they want anarchy it doesn't make any sense and again
[03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:20.460]  if we don't if we don't educate ourselves we don't educate their generations and work with people to
[03:11:20.460 --> 03:11:28.220]  understand what we're facing we are going to lose this fight we cannot lose this fight I just I see
[03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:34.500]  like you said CNN MSNBC even Fox News saying it's the new norm relax let's just not talk about it
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:40.260]  but when some scumbag lunatic white terrorists those and kills poor innocent black people nine
[03:11:40.260 --> 03:11:44.900]  of them every white person was the blame every southerner was a blame every Christian was the
[03:11:44.900 --> 03:11:49.140]  blame and I went wait a minute we're a diverse group we're not to blame for him but I decry
[03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:55.220]  what he did but when Islam does it Oh Islam's not involved when you said he was following exactly
[03:11:55.220 --> 03:12:00.740]  what Muhammad said to do exactly and again we go back to identifying our threat if we don't
[03:12:00.740 --> 03:12:05.620]  identify it which we won't I mean okay so you know we have a guy who went in there into a black
[03:12:05.620 --> 03:12:09.300]  church and he goes and kills a bunch of people okay what did we do what did we say we said oh
[03:12:09.300 --> 03:12:14.620]  well he's a racist and you know the Confederate flag is a racism flag so we're gonna get rid of
[03:12:14.620 --> 03:12:19.020]  all the Confederate flags now we're gonna get rid of all the statues we're getting rid so okay now
[03:12:19.020 --> 03:12:24.380]  he killed him with a with a truck so are we gonna go band all the trucks now is that what the
[03:12:24.380 --> 03:12:29.620]  Democrats gonna do we're gonna go band all the trucks that are being rented no they don't want
[03:12:29.620 --> 03:12:34.900]  to identify the actual threat the threat that it was is the person and the disease the disease
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:43.660]  ideology it's not an ideology it is what they believe it is 100% what they believe Islam is
[03:12:43.660 --> 03:12:49.940]  Islam there is no you know it's not a sub ideology that's what I meant is it's the political Islam
[03:12:49.940 --> 03:12:59.820]  it is it is the conquering cancerous Orthodox Islam yeah it's what they're trying to get us
[03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:08.460]  to accept but you know I I'm having a hard time accepting it myself so well here's the deal we
[03:13:08.460 --> 03:13:13.940]  can't let this continue and we can't lose our rights while we would then won't even profile
[03:13:13.940 --> 03:13:18.460]  people do you know five years ago the FBI tried to arrest him Obama wouldn't just like San
[03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:22.580]  Bernardino the FBI agents that investigated those guys two years before were under criminal
[03:13:22.580 --> 03:13:28.420]  investigation for civil rights violation Obama's Justice Department tried to put FBI and federal
[03:13:28.420 --> 03:13:34.020]  marshals in jail for investigating the San Bernardino shooters two years before they should
[03:13:34.020 --> 03:13:39.580]  have gotten medals exactly they should have and again what it comes back to is it comes back to
[03:13:39.580 --> 03:13:47.060]  you if you identify somebody who you think may not be right and you expose that person what happens
[03:13:47.060 --> 03:13:51.580]  you get beat up for it you get called a racist you get called a bigot and that's the thing and
[03:13:51.580 --> 03:13:55.740]  that's why I said on the other show if you see something that's not right if you don't say
[03:13:55.740 --> 03:14:01.660]  something all you're doing is allowing this to happen it's for me if I see something that's not
[03:14:01.660 --> 03:14:06.380]  right you know what if they're gonna call me a name because of it if it prevents a terrorist
[03:14:06.380 --> 03:14:10.060]  attack then then that's what I'm gonna go ahead and again the terror attacks are bad we're sorry
[03:14:10.060 --> 03:14:14.620]  for those that died but again there's the overarching drive politically of why is this
[03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:19.940]  being done what's going on and then you look at Hollywood and all their hate of just anything good
[03:14:19.940 --> 03:14:28.140]  it's just degeneracy all right my friend facebook.com forward slash steven dot g e r n steven

[03:20:56.980 --> 03:21:05.060]  2017 is the year he died so many people we lost this year trailing over stop rolling downhill
[03:21:05.060 --> 03:21:15.700]  and i went rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell well let me tell you that's
[03:21:15.700 --> 03:21:23.060]  finally turned around the pendulum swinging back with no kind of chance for the flag

[03:21:34.020 --> 03:21:39.460]  we're the tip of the spear you're the resistance we're changing the world if it wasn't true it'd
[03:21:39.460 --> 03:21:47.940]  be comical when i sit back and i realize it's not talk it's not even a good feeling it's it's like a
[03:21:49.700 --> 03:21:58.420]  sickening feeling but sickening in a good way like it's so epic so real so timeless so big
[03:21:58.420 --> 03:22:06.340]  that you can feel the victory you can see the finishing line but you know it's going to take
[03:22:06.340 --> 03:22:12.820]  everything you got to claw across it but then you look back at tyranny and other nations that
[03:22:12.820 --> 03:22:18.660]  have fallen and who wants to conquer us a bunch of devil worship and pedophiles i don't just say
[03:22:18.660 --> 03:22:26.340]  that that's who they are and you're like i need more energy to beat these people it's the opposite
[03:22:26.340 --> 03:22:33.060]  of feeling strong or confident it's feeling like we need to get more strength we need everything
[03:22:33.060 --> 03:22:39.300]  to defeat these people that's my frustration it isn't fear when they come after me of what
[03:22:39.300 --> 03:22:46.820]  they'll do to me it's fear that i'm too weak i mean when you think about these pedophiles we're
[03:22:46.820 --> 03:22:50.100]  up against ladies and gentlemen you think about the scum of the earth we're fighting i mean that's
[03:22:50.100 --> 03:22:55.060]  who they are they've organized these forces globally and how bad they are and what they're
[03:22:55.060 --> 03:23:00.020]  doing to us and you realize we have a chance to break their will they want to break our will
[03:23:00.900 --> 03:23:04.260]  that's why i'm telling you when you share the articles the videos the links
[03:23:04.260 --> 03:23:07.620]  we're seeing more censorship the last few months than we saw 10 years before

[03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:19.780]  strategically we're not revealing it yet but they already tried to destroy my life and my family and
[03:23:19.780 --> 03:23:26.260]  i'm not complaining i told everybody i'm asking for it i'm willing to do it i just need you to

[03:26:10.820 --> 03:26:18.500]  not understand that these personal attacks on us these threats to kill my wife my family my
[03:26:18.500 --> 03:26:27.540]  children and perhaps worst of all my beloved dogs this only makes me angrier and stronger and more
[03:26:28.260 --> 03:26:38.020]  firm in my resolve to expose the globalists to expose the globalists and expose uh those
[03:26:38.020 --> 03:26:46.500]  who would destroy the foundations and principles of america cbs has a little film that they put up
[03:26:46.500 --> 03:26:52.660]  let's show that uh because it shows you um how vicious the attack has become

[03:33:34.820 --> 03:33:43.140]  welcome back i am roger stone sitting in for my compatriot alex jones i'm a proud member of the
[03:33:43.140 --> 03:33:51.380]  info wars team and it was here on info wars that it was revealed to the world that president
[03:33:51.380 --> 03:34:01.460]  donald trump would declassify the controversial still secret and closely held john f kennedy
[03:34:01.460 --> 03:34:10.420]  assassination records you see in 1992 the congress in the wake of the impact of oliver stone's
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:19.300]  monumental film jfk passed legislation that set specific timelines for the release of this
[03:34:19.300 --> 03:34:29.780]  bombshell data even in the initial releases in the 80s and 90s the deep state the military industrial
[03:34:29.780 --> 03:34:37.860]  complex indeed those responsible for the murder of president kennedy managed to redact and censor
[03:34:37.860 --> 03:34:46.660]  and hold back much of the data when i spoke to the president of the united states two thursdays ago
[03:34:46.660 --> 03:34:54.340]  only two days before his historic tweet announcing that he would release this classified information
[03:34:55.380 --> 03:35:02.580]  he was most interested in transparency he was most interested in full disclosure
[03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:11.540]  and as i predicted the deep state the central intelligence agency principally caught by surprise
[03:35:12.180 --> 03:35:21.220]  had to move into high gear on a rear guard action to redact that means black out sensor and hold
[03:35:21.220 --> 03:35:28.660]  back as much of the data as possible hoping that the american people would learn little and that
[03:35:28.660 --> 03:35:37.700]  their myth that lee harvey oswald a communist nut acting alone shot president john fitzgerald
[03:35:37.700 --> 03:35:46.020]  kennedy three times from the back unfortunately now thanks to president trump's courageous and
[03:35:46.020 --> 03:35:53.220]  bold decision that narrative hasn't held up what have we learned well one paragraph that was
[03:35:53.220 --> 03:36:00.420]  brought to the fore in this release shows that the surgeon general of the united states concluded
[03:36:00.420 --> 03:36:07.860]  that john kennedy had been shot from the front and that the bullet entered at the at the neck
[03:36:07.860 --> 03:36:16.340]  at the trachea which is why a tracheotomy was hastily performed on him to hide that entry
[03:36:16.340 --> 03:36:24.260]  wound big problem for the government what else did we learn well we learned that the russian
[03:36:24.260 --> 03:36:32.260]  kgb conducted their own independent investigation into john kennedy's murder and they determined
[03:36:32.260 --> 03:36:41.220]  that linden baynes johnson lbj himself old big ears was the man who orchestrated the death of
[03:36:41.220 --> 03:36:49.300]  his predecessor you see linden johnson knew that the tennedy justice department was hot on his
[03:36:49.300 --> 03:36:56.340]  heels in both the bobby baker and billy sol estes corruption investigations and he knew that
[03:36:56.340 --> 03:37:03.860]  attorney general robert kennedy wanted him not only off the 1964 ticket but he also want him
[03:37:03.860 --> 03:37:11.220]  want him in a federal presidential a federal penitentiary yes lbj was the man staring into
[03:37:11.220 --> 03:37:19.220]  the abyss we also learned in the new disclosures that french intelligence at the request of first
[03:37:19.220 --> 03:37:26.340]  lady jacqueline kennedy conducted their own investigation and they determined that linden
[03:37:26.340 --> 03:37:33.780]  baynes johnson was the ringleader of the plot to kill our president what else did we learn well we
[03:37:33.780 --> 03:37:42.500]  learned that linden johnson as a young congressman in his early political career was a member of the
[03:37:42.500 --> 03:37:50.340]  ku klux klan that puts him up there with senator robert bird of west virginia no wonder they wanted
[03:37:50.340 --> 03:37:58.580]  this information withheld and kept from the american people after all linden johnson who
[03:37:58.580 --> 03:38:05.700]  a styles himself the civil rights president even though in his years in the senate he blocked every
[03:38:05.700 --> 03:38:14.340]  major piece of voting rights housing rights or civil rights legislation was reinventing himself
[03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:23.620]  for the uh for the consumption of the american voters lbj a member of the kkk we also learned
[03:38:23.620 --> 03:38:32.260]  that the government was aware of two witnesses who saw two men running from the site of the murder of
[03:38:32.260 --> 03:38:39.460]  the dallas police officer j d tippett and that neither one of those men met the physical
[03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:49.860]  description of lee harvey oswald we also learned that the casings found on the ground at the site
[03:38:49.860 --> 03:38:59.380]  of oswald's alleged shooting of tippett were from an automatic weapon yet when lee harvey oswald
[03:38:59.380 --> 03:39:06.740]  is arrested at the texas movie theater only minutes later he's found with a revolver
[03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:16.980]  so more and more information coming to the fore from president donald trump's historic decision
[03:39:16.980 --> 03:39:26.020]  next up is going to be an examination of the incendiary diaries of the legendary cia agent
[03:39:26.580 --> 03:39:34.420]  and agent provocateur e howard hunt it was infowars and alex jones who broke the story
[03:39:34.420 --> 03:39:43.140]  of the deathbed confessions of hunt who said and told infowars that he he was on the ground
[03:39:43.140 --> 03:39:50.980]  on the ground in dallas that the operation in delhi plaza was indeed a cia operation
[03:39:50.980 --> 03:39:57.540]  that general edwin landsdale of the cia was present and yes my favorite
[03:39:58.100 --> 03:40:08.180]  lbj he said was running the show we'll have more on that in infowars down the road now uh we are
[03:40:08.180 --> 03:40:15.860]  going to be taking your calls here shortly again the number eight eight eight two oh one two two
[03:40:16.420 --> 03:40:23.220]  four four but before we get to that i want to mention something that alex jones pointed out
[03:40:24.180 --> 03:40:31.460]  we don't have wealthy billionaires standing in the wings ready to write giant checks to underwrite
[03:40:31.460 --> 03:40:39.140]  our fight against the globalists we don't have a george soros or a rockefeller foundation or a
[03:40:39.140 --> 03:40:46.820]  ford foundation or any of these extremely well-heeled operations we have to depend on
[03:40:46.820 --> 03:40:53.620]  you and we can only depend on you that's why it's crucial you go to the infowars.com store
[03:40:53.620 --> 03:41:01.380]  where silver bullet uh the incredible collidal silver uh product is now on sale for 50 percent
[03:41:01.380 --> 03:41:08.260]  off i don't know how alex jones slashes these prices and does it successfully i guess it means
[03:41:08.260 --> 03:41:16.740]  we can move more product more volume but that is what is paying for this beautiful new studio that
[03:41:16.740 --> 03:41:23.700]  is what's paying for our expanded programming on the war room it's only because patriots like you
[03:41:23.700 --> 03:41:32.020]  have stepped forward and gotten some of the very best all-natural products you can find anywhere

[03:46:57.620 --> 03:47:25.140]  and here we go
[03:47:25.140 --> 03:47:33.860]  i'm roger stone sitting in for my compatriot and comrade alex jones we're in the foxhole together
[03:47:33.860 --> 03:47:40.900]  you know in a war against the globalists make no bones about it those who opposed
[03:47:40.900 --> 03:47:46.100]  donald trump in the last election those who thought his election incredibly improbable
[03:47:46.100 --> 03:47:53.060]  are committed to removing him from public office but we here at infowars we're not going to let
[03:47:53.060 --> 03:48:02.580]  that happen when i attacked that dainty little snowflake don lemon on my twitter feed little did
[03:48:02.580 --> 03:48:12.260]  i know that the twitter feed uber sensors would use that to close down my 300 000 follower twitter
[03:48:12.260 --> 03:48:20.740]  feed now the folks at at stone cold truth on twitter still follow my exploits and although
[03:48:20.740 --> 03:48:29.460]  i don't control that site you can keep up with my activities if you go there and you can also catch
[03:48:29.460 --> 03:48:37.780]  up with what i'm doing on the infowars twitter feed so i invite you to go to both and there's
[03:48:37.780 --> 03:48:47.860]  a petition up at stone cold truth to the twitter mavens demanding the improbable reinstatement i
[03:48:47.860 --> 03:48:56.100]  will see these folks in court you see it's time for twitter to be regulated like a utility and
[03:48:56.100 --> 03:49:04.020]  we will push until our first amendment rights are protected now let's go to your phone calls
[03:49:04.020 --> 03:49:09.460]  my favorite part of the show robert in washington what's on your mind
[03:49:09.460 --> 03:49:18.660]  roger how are you today terrific so my thing is and i see what's going on with november 4th
[03:49:18.660 --> 03:49:23.780]  i've been trying to tell a lot of my friends and family prepare for something worst case
[03:49:23.780 --> 03:49:30.100]  scenario something doesn't happen what if this is just another way to discredit the alt media
[03:49:30.100 --> 03:49:36.580]  you guys prepare for something big nothing happens they come back and say ha look at another
[03:49:36.580 --> 03:49:41.220]  you know lie that they tried to portray on the news and get everybody to believe
[03:49:42.660 --> 03:49:48.260]  well i must tell you i think that is unlikely because what i found out yesterday is that this
[03:49:48.260 --> 03:49:55.140]  agate prop that they have planned for the streets that they are ginning up with their tom styer
[03:49:55.140 --> 03:50:03.140]  paid for tv commercials with their soros financed full-page newspaper ads that's just one part of
[03:50:03.140 --> 03:50:11.220]  the plot this is a part and parcel of an effort to try to invoke the 25th amendment now under the
[03:50:11.220 --> 03:50:19.300]  25th amendment of the constitution if a majority of the cabinet and the vice president decide
[03:50:19.300 --> 03:50:26.660]  that the president is non-compass mentis that he is no longer mentally stable and able to fulfill
[03:50:26.660 --> 03:50:34.500]  the duties of his office he shall be removed now the president can appeal that question to the u.s
[03:50:34.500 --> 03:50:41.940]  house of representatives but why do we think the rhinos who control the house republican caucus
[03:50:41.940 --> 03:50:48.260]  would be of a mind to keep donald trump in place we're going to be outlining this whole
[03:50:48.260 --> 03:50:57.700]  nefarious plot this week on info wars but i see a political synergy here where the street operations
[03:50:57.700 --> 03:51:07.620]  paid for by styer and soros and others jibe with the maneuverings of jeb bush and ben sass and
[03:51:07.620 --> 03:51:18.820]  jeb bush and ben sass and others in washington who are attempting to engineer this uh this 25th
[03:51:18.820 --> 03:51:27.220]  amendment coup i can report definitively here on info wars private meetings between senator sass
[03:51:27.220 --> 03:51:37.300]  and vice president pence very very recently what was that meeting about senator let's go
[03:51:37.300 --> 03:51:46.820]  to uh deborah in california deborah what's your question for info wars today my question is um
[03:51:48.660 --> 03:51:53.300]  isn't it almost treason to put out that ad in the new york times that said we're trying to take the
[03:51:53.300 --> 03:51:59.780]  government down well that's the great thing about our constitution and the first amendment although
[03:51:59.780 --> 03:52:05.940]  they don't respect it at twitter we do respect it here at info wars you see i'm against censorship
[03:52:05.940 --> 03:52:13.380]  i don't care if you're the looniest most whacked out left-winger in the world other than uh physical
[03:52:13.380 --> 03:52:20.020]  threats of violence threats to kill my wife and my family and my dogs uh pretty much everything
[03:52:20.020 --> 03:52:27.300]  else in my view is fairly protected speech but i do agree with you in this sense they have shown
[03:52:27.300 --> 03:52:35.460]  their hand and these are interrelated operations this is not some street rabble paid for uh
[03:52:35.460 --> 03:52:41.540]  by george soros they are working with members of the political establishment both republican and
[03:52:41.540 --> 03:52:48.340]  democrat at the highest levels to attempt to achieve what they could not achieve at the
[03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:56.900]  balance box which is the removal of our president thank you very much for your call now let's go to
[03:52:56.900 --> 03:53:06.820]  uh jude in cincinnati uh jude don't bring me down what is your question i get that i bet you
[03:53:08.340 --> 03:53:14.820]  so a big story that i've been um personally researching and thinking that is like it isn't
[03:53:14.820 --> 03:53:20.100]  fairly covered and kind of ties everything in is really hillary's dating back when she became
[03:53:20.100 --> 03:53:27.300]  secretary of state um she was taking a lot of money into her foundation from even like katar
[03:53:27.300 --> 03:53:33.380]  and then when libya happened you know that whole thing with qaddafi we know you know bengazi turned
[03:53:33.380 --> 03:53:40.020]  into the real story but it was really she was allowing qatar to fund rebel groups in this
[03:53:40.020 --> 03:53:47.060]  country and then that broke out sort of into syria because then they were funneling those
[03:53:47.060 --> 03:53:52.660]  fighters they're basically mercenaries cia is training them to syria and like the guy that
[03:53:52.660 --> 03:53:57.700]  was on previously saying you know these guys they're either sharia or not they're committing
[03:53:57.700 --> 03:54:02.900]  jihad a lot of these people that they were training committed jihad in syria created
[03:54:02.900 --> 03:54:09.140]  this huge refugee crisis and the people that hate nationalism that really led to the nationalist
[03:54:09.140 --> 03:54:16.900]  movements um that refugee crisis well you raise a good point and i guess i would say if you want
[03:54:16.900 --> 03:54:23.540]  to know what's going to happen watch what happened in ukraine very carefully because uh what happened
[03:54:23.540 --> 03:54:32.740]  there is that the billionaire globalist victor pinchuk paid the clinton foundation so much money
[03:54:32.740 --> 03:54:41.220]  that he was allowed to mount a neo-nazi coup overturning the democratically elected government
[03:54:41.220 --> 03:54:50.740]  of ukraine uh and it's interesting that their slogan uh blood and soil pops up as the slogan
[03:54:50.740 --> 03:54:59.860]  allegedly of the of the antifa and ties in charlottesville coincidence i think not it is
[03:54:59.860 --> 03:55:06.980]  exactly the same kind of coup that they have in mind here in the united states bill and hillary
[03:55:06.980 --> 03:55:14.260]  clinton are traitors they worship the almighty dollar they are not liberals they are not
[03:55:14.260 --> 03:55:21.700]  progressives they're not even globalists they are just greedy criminals and you could purchase from
[03:55:21.700 --> 03:55:29.460]  them virtually anything in this case the united states government agreed to look the other way
[03:55:29.460 --> 03:55:36.980]  while a violent coup was mounted against the democratically elected government of ukraine that
[03:55:36.980 --> 03:55:44.420]  is what they have in mind here in the united states jude thank you for your call daniel in
[03:55:44.420 --> 03:55:53.700]  alabama alabama a state that recently made major news with the rejection of senator luther strange
[03:55:53.700 --> 03:56:00.820]  the hand-picked candidate of senator mitch mcconnell uh and instead uh nominated in the
[03:56:00.820 --> 03:56:07.460]  republican primary judge roy moore a constitutionalist daniel what's on your mind
[03:56:08.660 --> 03:56:14.180]  oh yes i just wanted to talk about the jfk files um y'all keep saying that trump's released them
[03:56:14.180 --> 03:56:18.660]  off and he's only released the files associated with jfk's assassination
[03:56:18.660 --> 03:56:27.380]  um well in fact i'll go a step further i would like to see the president go back uh and review
[03:56:27.380 --> 03:56:35.940]  the material that was already previously released under the 1992 jfk records act which is far too
[03:56:35.940 --> 03:56:44.180]  heavily readacted which means blacked out uh in my opinion i'd like to see him do with that material
[03:56:44.180 --> 03:56:50.020]  what he has just ordered be done with the more recent disclosures which is get rid of the
[03:56:50.020 --> 03:56:55.380]  redactions get rid of the blackings out and the president came up with a very clever and i think
[03:56:55.380 --> 03:57:04.020]  smart response to his deep state handlers he's happy to withhold any information that revolves
[03:57:04.020 --> 03:57:13.700]  around or regards people who are still living today that is very very very few in terms of
[03:57:13.700 --> 03:57:20.580]  involvement in this data so uh yes i will be calling on the president to release it all and
[03:57:20.580 --> 03:57:27.540]  the sooner the better i'm roger stone you're on the alex jones show and we'll be back for more of
[03:57:27.540 --> 03:57:46.420]  your calls you're listening to the alex jones show
