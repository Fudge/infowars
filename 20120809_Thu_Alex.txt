[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:39.400]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we have got a big broadcast lined up for
[00:39.400 --> 00:46.720]  you today we are going to be here for the next three hours and in studio one
[00:46.720 --> 00:51.940]  of our new reporters he's not officially hired yet to move to Austin Texas from
[00:51.940 --> 00:56.180]  North Carolina but we're hoping that's gonna be the case I'd say that's about
[00:56.180 --> 01:00.180]  a 90% chance right now but regardless he'll end up being a correspondent for
[01:00.180 --> 01:07.460]  us David Knight is going to be joining us to break down the energy takeover the
[01:07.460 --> 01:12.740]  strategic deindustrialization of the United States it's not a very sexy topic
[01:12.740 --> 01:16.940]  but it's one of the most important we face as a society he'll be joining us at
[01:16.940 --> 01:20.180]  the bottom of the hour then we're gonna have open phones in the second hour and
[01:20.180 --> 01:24.980]  then Holland Vander Neuenhoff who a few weeks ago sat in as a guest house he's
[01:24.980 --> 01:28.100]  going to be joining us because he's a researcher into false flags and also one
[01:28.100 --> 01:32.180]  of the makers of a very important film exposing this current crew at the
[01:32.180 --> 01:37.180]  Justice Department for their operation in Oklahoma City in 95 and we're in
[01:37.180 --> 01:41.080]  grave danger of them staging more fall false flags that's coming up in the
[01:41.080 --> 01:48.340]  third hour I rarely drop the ball really really bad and it's okay that we do you
[01:48.340 --> 01:53.460]  know I tend to get tunnel vision a few weeks ago yeah we probably had 10
[01:53.460 --> 01:57.300]  articles about it and videos posted I mentioned it probably five six times but
[01:57.300 --> 02:02.380]  I should have talked about Bohemian Grove more while it was going on from
[02:02.380 --> 02:06.460]  July 15th and July 31st with global leaders involved in all sorts of weird
[02:06.460 --> 02:10.140]  rituals and sexual activities and the reason that's important is they're
[02:10.140 --> 02:13.740]  being blackmailed inside there but that pales in significance because I didn't
[02:13.740 --> 02:17.260]  really drop the ball there I just I just didn't you know score the touchdown with
[02:17.260 --> 02:21.900]  a lot of finesse because they were trying to pass the UN gun treaty and a
[02:21.900 --> 02:26.780]  bunch of other news openly funding al Qaeda in Syria I get tunnel vision on
[02:26.780 --> 02:32.860]  certain subjects one day I ran it for two hours about the police driving one of
[02:32.860 --> 02:36.540]  their dead comrades to his cemetery driving the wrong direction and shutting
[02:36.540 --> 02:40.340]  down traffic and awesome for five hours I just said I bet that dead cop wouldn't
[02:40.340 --> 02:45.300]  want traffic shut down for five hours on major highways or nobody can get their
[02:45.300 --> 02:48.580]  kids out of school but still it was uncalled for I didn't even get any
[02:48.580 --> 02:52.860]  backlash for that I just later realized I spent two hours of a three-hour show
[02:52.860 --> 02:57.260]  worldwide ranting about that I mean I do that because there's no teleprompters
[02:57.260 --> 03:01.220]  there's no producers telling me what to do there's no program director it's Alex
[03:01.220 --> 03:07.700]  Jones what comes out of my mouth is what I'm really thinking months ago I knew
[03:07.700 --> 03:12.180]  about and and mentioned on there I did it months ago and I mentioned it last
[03:12.180 --> 03:14.580]  week I think it was Wednesday the crew remembers that they think it was
[03:14.580 --> 03:18.340]  Wednesday or Thursday just to prove this and I'm not tooting my horn I'm
[03:18.340 --> 03:25.380]  actually kicking my shelf here I said I have multiple IRS whistleblowers and I
[03:25.380 --> 03:29.500]  was trying for the last few weeks to get one of them in the TV studio we were
[03:29.500 --> 03:32.820]  gonna have them in the dark and then disguise their voice into an interview
[03:32.820 --> 03:39.580]  and they checked their agreements and things and check and out both of them
[03:39.580 --> 03:44.780]  did and they were telling me well a lot of this is public knowledge but hidden
[03:44.780 --> 03:48.180]  in plain view nobody really knows about it they told me look here look there and
[03:48.180 --> 03:52.980]  I did and I tried to get one of my writers to do the report but they're
[03:52.980 --> 03:58.140]  like are you sure about this and then I tried to get one of the whistleblowers
[03:58.140 --> 04:06.260]  to write it under a gnome to plume under a pen name wouldn't do it and so now it
[04:06.260 --> 04:11.540]  broke Monday Tuesday drudge blew it out big the last two days and now it's in
[04:11.540 --> 04:15.580]  the Associated Press and now the solicitor general has released the
[04:15.580 --> 04:20.980]  inspector general has released the report of what I knew let's be conservative
[04:20.980 --> 04:26.500]  a month and a half ago and again here's the problem we get classified stuff
[04:26.500 --> 04:29.740]  sent in here we don't know if it's real or not and if it's just classified we
[04:29.740 --> 04:34.500]  just delete it because you can get arrested for that type stuff we need
[04:34.500 --> 04:39.220]  stuff that's restricted but public knowledge or the government's committing
[04:39.220 --> 04:43.620]  crimes I'm willing to expose it even if it's secret like a lot of the reports
[04:43.620 --> 04:46.820]  we've broken here we we've broken a lot of news that's why they put out the
[04:46.820 --> 04:50.220]  dis info meme that you can't trust info wars you can trust stuff covering you
[04:50.220 --> 04:55.540]  know aliens and stuff we're gonna get into this giving illegal aliens basically
[04:55.540 --> 05:01.100]  free taxpayer money on the other side with the IRS straight ahead hi this is

[08:02.420 --> 08:07.300]  central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war
[08:07.300 --> 08:13.660]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:20.900 --> 08:28.940]  it's already Thursday the ninth day of August 2012 coming up in studio in about
[08:28.940 --> 08:35.380]  25 minutes David Knight in Full Wars.com reporter is going to be joining
[08:35.380 --> 08:41.060]  us in studio he filed a powerful report last night for the info wars nightly
[08:41.060 --> 08:44.940]  news dealing with free speech zones as we mentioned yesterday federal court has
[08:44.940 --> 08:50.940]  ruled you've only got a First Amendment in little special zones so all the other
[08:50.940 --> 08:53.860]  rulings have said if you're not blocking traffic everywhere as a free speech
[08:53.860 --> 08:59.580]  zone very draconian a very very dark day for the Republic but that's not why
[08:59.580 --> 09:03.300]  he's going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour we're going to
[09:03.300 --> 09:08.220]  look at the energy shutdown system they have sworn that they are going to shut
[09:08.220 --> 09:12.940]  down the globalist have our industry and all over the country as the as the
[09:12.940 --> 09:17.380]  secretary energy said last year they're going to quote shut down massive numbers
[09:17.380 --> 09:20.940]  of coal powered plants including modern ones that nothing comes out of them at
[09:20.940 --> 09:26.340]  water vapor and carbon dioxide very life-giving but the media points cameras
[09:26.340 --> 09:31.140]  at the steam coming out especially in cold weather it says look at the
[09:31.140 --> 09:34.580]  pollution just like they show a polar bear in an ice flow and say it's going
[09:34.580 --> 09:39.180]  to drown polar bears are the farthest land swimming animals they hunt on the
[09:39.180 --> 09:44.700]  ice flows but they they prey on ignorance and so he's going to be joining us
[09:44.700 --> 09:49.780]  because it's water vapor and steam coming out just like when you exhale and
[09:49.780 --> 09:55.380]  cold weather that is not toxic waste that is carbon dioxide and other gases and
[09:55.380 --> 10:00.340]  water vapor hitting colder air but that even the New York Times says they want
[10:00.340 --> 10:06.540]  to tax on breathing I saw driving out of my place this morning a few doors down
[10:06.540 --> 10:11.500]  to live out in the country of some energy audit trucks parked at the neighbor's
[10:11.500 --> 10:15.740]  house going in and as you basically get half off your your air conditioners and
[10:15.740 --> 10:20.820]  things with people's tax money it's not free you're paying for it already but the
[10:20.820 --> 10:24.220]  gangsters give you back some of your money and they admit worldwide they
[10:24.220 --> 10:27.220]  already done this in Australia England and Canada for a decade or so they have
[10:27.220 --> 10:32.140]  energy audits where you get discounts if you get it and then soon it's just hey
[10:32.140 --> 10:37.300]  let me in I'm gonna energy audit you and they raise the audit specs to the
[10:37.300 --> 10:42.100]  point of no one can comply and that was actually in the carbon tax law Obama
[10:42.100 --> 10:46.540]  tried to pass three years ago but it failed in Congress so they're just
[10:46.540 --> 10:51.100]  going ahead with it anyways illegally and it said everyone will get yearly
[10:51.100 --> 10:54.660]  federal audits and they will come in your house and if within one week you
[10:54.660 --> 10:58.780]  have it made the changes they say your home is taken no judge no jury the
[10:58.780 --> 11:04.100]  government takes it I mean this makes it it makes the Soviets look tame I mean
[11:04.100 --> 11:10.500]  it is just flaming tyranny but it's all done as cool and fun and hey it's just
[11:10.500 --> 11:15.900]  an audit but they call it an audit just like just like they it's a condition
[11:15.900 --> 11:19.140]  you just like they have all over the world gun buyback programs will pay it
[11:19.140 --> 11:22.580]  for those guns and it's almost always old ladies who didn't like guns their
[11:22.580 --> 11:25.860]  husbands and the nursing home or has died and you see him handing over to
[11:25.860 --> 11:32.420]  cops $5,000 carved fine shotguns they bought you know 60 years before for
[11:32.420 --> 11:37.540]  $500 you see them handing them over to cops whose eyes are the size of
[11:37.540 --> 11:41.540]  saucers who always get caught down the road showing them out the back door of
[11:41.540 --> 11:44.780]  the police station and I'm not for corruption but who could blame them I
[11:44.780 --> 11:49.380]  mean you're not gonna chop up a $5,000 shotgun cuz some old lady came and got
[11:49.380 --> 11:55.540]  a $50 coupon to best buy or to chilies or $100 coupon it's usually 50 because
[11:55.540 --> 12:01.620]  she turned it in I mean it is a madness madness going on and that's done to
[12:01.620 --> 12:06.900]  condition everybody they admit this that's done to get you to accept it
[12:06.900 --> 12:13.260]  they have raised the energy audits on cars in in Austin opting into federal
[12:13.260 --> 12:17.700]  regulations to the level of even the newest cars can't pass the inspections
[12:17.700 --> 12:21.940]  you have to pay a federal fine and inspection and I remember over the
[12:21.940 --> 12:26.460]  decade ago we have access TV shows I did on this they're online they should be
[12:26.460 --> 12:30.540]  Mike Hansen's got the tapes of the shows I've got some of them too but the point
[12:30.540 --> 12:37.020]  is is that we went down to quote Austin Air Force free inspections at the higher
[12:37.020 --> 12:40.180]  level and I went down there and talked to the head guy they call it Austin
[12:40.180 --> 12:44.420]  Air Force it's a federally funded grant private group the Austin Air Force and I
[12:44.420 --> 12:46.900]  go hey you're planning to make this mandatory this is just a condition
[12:46.900 --> 12:52.580]  people he goes yep sure is Alex they're very proud of themselves you have to
[12:52.580 --> 12:56.620]  understand this is that this is all a big joke to them genetic engineering
[12:56.620 --> 13:02.380]  toxic waste dumping they're there to take your ranch and then five years later
[13:02.380 --> 13:06.060]  sell it to their buddies at pennies on the dollar and build shopping malls on
[13:06.060 --> 13:13.900]  it okay this is gangsterism this is lawlessness now I'm gonna get to that
[13:13.900 --> 13:17.740]  again at the bottom of the hour here now in about 16 17 minutes we're gonna get

[15:10.340 --> 15:13.380]  it's the fact that if it's a medical person they're professional they're

[15:55.900 --> 15:59.220]  this is a big deal and that's why they've had fighter pilots and people who
[15:59.220 --> 16:02.380]  are not professional airline pilots who become physically ill because they've
[16:02.380 --> 16:06.700]  never been put in this position in their life I mean even if that was their
[16:06.700 --> 16:11.060]  sexual preference you know that to have a man rubbing on a man or a woman on a
[16:11.060 --> 16:18.540]  woman or whatever or or or heterosexual the fact that it's forced is horrible
[16:18.540 --> 16:25.580]  now these people they're sickos who like forcing things on people continuing
[16:25.580 --> 16:29.300]  more than a hundred million Americans on one form of welfare another devastating
[16:29.300 --> 16:34.100]  article up at info wars.com and prisonpunna.com the dispossessed minority
[16:34.100 --> 16:37.580]  Paul Craig Roberts writes about that federal court upholds free speech zone
[16:37.580 --> 16:40.900]  roundup they have a night reports mention that American families fight back
[16:40.900 --> 16:46.380]  against FDA raw milk to stop up very important report with Rob do British
[16:46.380 --> 16:49.820]  thought police again rest man for not smiling we covered that yesterday but
[16:49.820 --> 16:53.780]  it's just the they're defending it that you must be disappeared if you don't
[16:53.780 --> 17:01.900]  smile that's actually out of 1984 abortionist calls the death of the
[17:01.900 --> 17:11.500]  abortion of children ugly black babies a service so that is up at info wars.com
[17:11.500 --> 17:18.540]  and prisonplanet.com right now now that said let me just stop I sometimes drop
[17:18.540 --> 17:23.060]  the ball and and and I don't like it when I do it I get so focused on other
[17:23.060 --> 17:27.740]  issues I don't I don't get stories that we have I don't vet them properly so I
[17:27.740 --> 17:32.060]  never put them out I mean we vet things a lot more than mainstream media and we
[17:32.060 --> 17:36.140]  sure vetted more than the trash fake conspiracy internet stuff out there that
[17:36.140 --> 17:41.020]  just constantly makes up stuff that next week all the evil neural water will be
[17:41.020 --> 17:44.620]  arrested or aliens will land and then those very groups are always in full
[17:44.620 --> 17:47.820]  wars is incredible because most of those are globalist operatives of the
[17:47.820 --> 17:53.860]  Cass Sunstein cognitive dissonance flavor but it's got to be over a month
[17:53.860 --> 17:56.700]  it's more like a month and a half well it's actually more than that it's like
[17:56.700 --> 18:00.180]  it's more like a year this whistleblower one of them the big one first made
[18:00.180 --> 18:05.460]  contact senior IRS I'm not gonna say any more than that at the biggest IRS
[18:05.460 --> 18:12.500]  Center in the country here in Austin Texas has made contact with us I say
[18:12.500 --> 18:16.340]  year and a half time just flies three years ago but now that I really think
[18:16.340 --> 18:21.780]  about it and the last month and a half started giving us open source documents
[18:21.780 --> 18:26.060]  saying look at this look at that I had another whistleblower free family get us
[18:26.060 --> 18:29.820]  info because it's a this is the big story actually I have a bunch of breaking
[18:29.820 --> 18:35.100]  news here and my writers are actually so good about wanting to obsess on
[18:35.100 --> 18:40.220]  everything being documented that we just never got this done because a lot of
[18:40.220 --> 18:43.220]  it's over the phone and I'm like well why don't you come in and I've met with
[18:43.220 --> 18:47.260]  one of the people before families met with the other and it just never
[18:47.260 --> 18:53.660]  happened and they just kept saying well I don't want to violate these agreements
[18:53.660 --> 18:57.340]  even though I know this is illegal even though I know I can be protected we've
[18:57.340 --> 19:02.140]  tried to bring this to higher ups in Congress as we're supposed to do through
[19:02.140 --> 19:06.700]  the whistleblower rules it hasn't been done and by the way here's the breaking
[19:06.700 --> 19:09.580]  news because I mentioned this last Wednesday on here I said I've got a big
[19:09.580 --> 19:13.820]  whistleblower I've been procrastinating it's huge it deals with tax ID numbers
[19:13.820 --> 19:18.660]  illegal aliens and more and it's finally in the associated press today and I
[19:18.660 --> 19:22.820]  believe we fleshed this out last week I believe like a cubby a quail we scared
[19:22.820 --> 19:25.820]  this out in the open so you know what it's even better that it came out in
[19:25.820 --> 19:28.780]  mainstream because it ended up having more credibility the dinosaur media
[19:28.780 --> 19:32.380]  covered it because of a tree falls in the woods and then an associated press
[19:32.380 --> 19:38.700]  doesn't say it fell you know it didn't fall but all the stuff everything I was
[19:38.700 --> 19:43.260]  told by these people and told where to look all came out in triplicate but

[25:18.740 --> 25:24.260]  states is five states is based but also does auditing for much the rest of the
[25:24.260 --> 25:28.300]  country for the private fellow reserve that runs this country and has taken it
[25:28.300 --> 25:35.180]  over with its collaborators here's the news there is the worst morale ever this
[25:35.180 --> 25:40.140]  is from a senior person and a mid-level I have two different ones that I've been
[25:40.140 --> 25:45.620]  trying to get on air and I'm like and they're always well look here this is
[25:45.620 --> 25:49.580]  part of it you know they'll never tell me everything and I'm like but it's
[25:49.580 --> 25:56.060]  crimes you're saying being committed and so you've got a responsibility they go
[25:56.060 --> 25:59.860]  yeah but we were supposed to report it through this supposed chain and of
[25:59.860 --> 26:04.020]  course that's in the news right now report finds widespread fraud and taxpayer

[26:14.980 --> 26:19.940]  they hire illegal aliens to build the fake wall IRS keeps ignoring tax
[26:19.940 --> 26:25.300]  whistleblowers the examiner IRS staff were instructed to overlook fraud in
[26:25.300 --> 26:31.180]  applications for taxpayer IDs IRS discouraged fraud detection and ID
[26:31.180 --> 26:35.020]  program you heard me last week said I had a big IRS whistleblower and this all
[26:35.020 --> 26:40.260]  came out of Austin and I've talked to the people I've talked to one of them
[26:40.260 --> 26:46.380]  they are not the ones that told the drudge report and examiner and others
[26:46.380 --> 26:56.940]  this information that's now forced the associated press today and Reuters to
[26:56.940 --> 27:01.740]  come out with the news IRS allowed bogus taxpayer IDs watchdog report IRS
[27:01.740 --> 27:05.460]  discouraged fraud detection and ID program associated press August 9th
[27:05.460 --> 27:11.020]  that's today you heard me last Wednesday I said who we got big IRS news big
[27:11.020 --> 27:15.100]  whistleblower because I was going to write the article this week I was
[27:15.100 --> 27:19.300]  begging them to do it under a pen name and saying please will you just write it
[27:19.300 --> 27:23.620]  so I get it all right and so I don't say something I'm not supposed to say and
[27:23.620 --> 27:29.340]  they're like all good to you in a few days yeah fine and yeah I like the credit
[27:29.340 --> 27:33.500]  I like to break big news I like to expose globalist I mean I'm in it to win it
[27:33.500 --> 27:38.180]  but I'm really just mad at myself for not getting it done but but let me give
[27:38.180 --> 27:45.420]  you the rest of the breaking news there is a giant total collapse of morale and
[27:45.420 --> 27:50.460]  people openly saying we are committing crimes this is pure evil and fast and
[27:50.460 --> 27:53.860]  furious is being discussed they realize now they've looked over the fact that
[27:53.860 --> 27:57.860]  they really work for the private Federal Reserve we're gonna get Joe Banas of the
[27:57.860 --> 28:02.540]  former Treasury agent in studio next week to break this down he's coming
[28:02.540 --> 28:06.460]  through town because he saw this you know 15 years ago and went public and
[28:06.460 --> 28:11.660]  they arrested him for exposing it and he he beat him in court with a jury trial
[28:11.660 --> 28:15.460]  but I mean this is how dangerous this is but they're all learning that the
[28:15.460 --> 28:18.460]  Federal Reserve took over they're learning about the different commissions
[28:18.460 --> 28:21.820]  Ronald Reagan had that all the money goes to offshore banks none of it to run
[28:21.820 --> 28:29.340]  the country this is all coming out now and so I'm here in Austin Texas they're
[28:29.340 --> 28:32.620]  all listening to the show in fact they've been told don't listen to my show on
[28:32.620 --> 28:36.260]  their lunch hour so there's a bunch of stuff going on I don't want to give away
[28:36.260 --> 28:39.940]  too much to get people in trouble but I have a senior person very senior and
[28:39.940 --> 28:46.580]  another mid-level and here's what's really happening now get ready for this
[28:46.580 --> 28:55.900]  over 5 million people a year US citizens when the illegal aliens are given as
[28:55.900 --> 29:03.940]  many fake tax ID numbers as they can want I was told about one house in
[29:03.940 --> 29:13.300]  Austin Texas one house with over a half million dollars as an example of these
[29:13.300 --> 29:17.780]  checks these tax rebates being sent to them and here's what's not in the
[29:17.780 --> 29:23.860]  Associated Press they are linking up the fake tax ID numbers with real people's
[29:23.860 --> 29:32.140]  social security numbers and then the IRS is coming after the real people and
[29:32.140 --> 29:36.340]  taking their bank accounts because of the illegals I think I'm gonna finish up
[29:36.340 --> 29:39.460]  with this when we come back and then we're gonna go to David Knight is gonna

[34:50.420 --> 34:55.740]  start of the next hour where they admit and where the US Treasury inspector
[34:55.740 --> 35:01.100]  admits and that's that's Tim Geithner former you know head of the Federal
[35:01.100 --> 35:05.460]  Reserve New York branch that really runs the whole show because I was saying
[35:05.460 --> 35:09.540]  last week undoubtedly this all broken Austin that hey I've got whistle blowers
[35:09.540 --> 35:14.460]  about illegal aliens being given tax ID numbers I've got whistle blowers on a
[35:14.460 --> 35:19.660]  mutiny at the IRS I've got stuff about the Russians and the Chinese
[35:19.660 --> 35:26.220]  governments but mafias and the IRS controllers themselves upwards of five
[35:26.220 --> 35:30.700]  million Americans are having their identity stolen and you notice Bank of
[35:30.700 --> 35:33.700]  America's released social security numbers the Texas comp crawler released
[35:33.700 --> 35:38.100]  millions a few years ago the IRS is doing it they let the illegals get fake
[35:38.100 --> 35:43.980]  ones if you they're real but they're fake they get them from the social
[35:43.980 --> 35:47.340]  security that's really the Federal Reserve administration but what's what
[35:47.340 --> 35:50.740]  they're not telling you when it's not in the Associated Press they're admitting
[35:50.740 --> 35:56.220]  the identity fraud is that with these tax IDs they're linking them up with social
[35:56.220 --> 36:03.820]  security numbers and then the IRS comes back and says these are fraudulent tax
[36:03.820 --> 36:08.940]  refunds you've been asking for and child exemptions we're freezing your bank
[36:08.940 --> 36:13.020]  account and this is what's freaking out the IRS they don't a lot of the employees
[36:13.020 --> 36:15.700]  don't care if they're just mercenaries for the Private Fellow Reserve they make
[36:15.700 --> 36:19.460]  excuses about meet the new boss same as the old boss what's freaking them out
[36:19.460 --> 36:22.500]  I'm gonna break this down next hour because there's so much I've been told
[36:22.500 --> 36:26.580]  that's now all coming out and I just never codified it or you know did report
[36:26.580 --> 36:30.900]  on it is that they're freaking out because they're even having family
[36:30.900 --> 36:35.700]  members cousins aunts uncles parents children who are having their identity
[36:35.700 --> 36:40.620]  stolen the IRS is then a year or two later seizing their bank account their
[36:40.620 --> 36:45.380]  credits ruined and they're even taking their houses and over 70% of the people
[36:45.380 --> 36:50.660]  they're going after now are retirees and they're taking their homes based on
[36:50.660 --> 36:55.700]  fraud and it's not just that the fraud is so widespread well it's kind of like it
[36:55.700 --> 37:03.860]  came out last year in Bloomberg that for what is it since 1999 13 years all of
[37:03.860 --> 37:07.340]  the veterans when they die from World War two right through to now they're
[37:07.340 --> 37:09.940]  supposed to get a death benefit especially if they've paid into it is it
[37:09.940 --> 37:15.500]  life insurance it's just taken no one gets in trouble fast and furious all of
[37:15.500 --> 37:21.460]  this criminality is just rampant and it's now reached a point this is when
[37:21.460 --> 37:25.740]  society start collapsing and into authoritarianism because people are
[37:25.740 --> 37:29.980]  going to be homeless or they're going to be driven on to welfare which is what
[37:29.980 --> 37:33.100]  the globalists want they bankrupt you they make it impossible to operate in
[37:33.100 --> 37:37.740]  this society they they pay with your tax money to ship your jobs overseas they
[37:37.740 --> 37:42.100]  harass you with regulations they increase your power prices the regulations
[37:42.100 --> 37:46.980]  they go after the family farms they shut down the swap meets they make it
[37:46.980 --> 37:50.300]  illegal to use cash and second-hand transactions in multiple states they
[37:50.300 --> 37:53.980]  start shutting down backyard and front yard gardens they start saying you can't
[37:53.980 --> 37:59.900]  have dust in the family farm or hay dust they throw this bureaucratic goo at us
[37:59.900 --> 38:07.500]  this this this this red tape and most of what half of Congress doesn't pay the
[38:07.500 --> 38:10.380]  taxes all the big globalists are exempt they're involved that inside are
[38:10.380 --> 38:15.540]  trading it's lawlessness and they're going to raise taxes on all of us that
[38:15.540 --> 38:18.780]  actually work still that can hang on who are smart enough to be able to operate
[38:18.780 --> 38:22.140]  what's left of the free market the entrepreneurs were there we're being
[38:22.140 --> 38:25.860]  told you didn't build that just like linen did to the Kulaks now there's
[38:25.860 --> 38:29.300]  where they took their property installing I mean hey you didn't build that
[38:29.300 --> 38:34.340]  we're taking it Chavez says that I mean these are dangerous criminals and the
[38:34.340 --> 38:39.900]  IRS is their employees are all freaking out and a lot of them are just
[38:39.900 --> 38:43.220]  refusing to do it now that's why they're trying to go to an automated system and
[38:43.220 --> 38:46.260]  just no due process start taking stuff out of your account because let me
[38:46.260 --> 38:50.220]  explain well I'll break it down next hour we're joined in studio talking
[38:50.220 --> 38:55.500]  about massive scams by David Knight he's a media fellow at the American
[38:55.500 --> 39:00.100]  Tradition Institute that sounds evil and a video producer and entrepreneur with
[39:00.100 --> 39:04.660]  Sina film media and he's very close to being a reporter you saw him last night
[39:04.660 --> 39:09.660]  down here and he wants to come to us and we want him to be here and so it's a
[39:09.660 --> 39:13.260]  very good chance you'll see him here in the next two or three months he'll be
[39:13.260 --> 39:17.740]  down here we've got six reporters that all want to come we're lining up the
[39:17.740 --> 39:22.940]  final final layout to try to get everybody here get it all set up and go
[39:22.940 --> 39:25.740]  to the next level and it's all because of you support in the endfall war
[39:25.740 --> 39:32.800]  ladies and gentlemen and he has been on the cutting edge of researching the
[39:32.800 --> 39:38.300]  siege against the West the globalist very simply can come in give exemptions
[39:38.300 --> 39:42.180]  of their power plants shut down city owned or other privately owned power
[39:42.180 --> 39:47.060]  plants that are totally clean even let the old plants that are dirty operate
[39:47.060 --> 39:50.260]  if they're owned by General Electric or maintained by them GE and others will
[39:50.260 --> 39:52.780]  come to you who've been given waivers by Obama and say let us go ahead and take
[39:52.780 --> 39:57.260]  over operations you can stay open and so we've seen the last decade of doubling
[39:57.260 --> 40:00.180]  roughly in prices they admit that there's about another doubling over the
[40:00.180 --> 40:03.980]  next three years we're talking about three billion extra for a handful of
[40:03.980 --> 40:09.460]  globalist power companies just like in Ron they came up with this in 2000 they
[40:09.460 --> 40:12.340]  would make billions a day sometimes in California they would just turn the
[40:12.340 --> 40:16.900]  power off and they said if we do that the memos came out in court that pre
[40:16.900 --> 40:20.620]  creates a perception of scarcity artificial scarcity we could jack up
[40:20.620 --> 40:25.500]  prices sometimes they would make multi billions a day doing this on the West
[40:25.500 --> 40:30.380]  Coast this is the new system but they but our mayor says we can't ever
[40:30.380 --> 40:35.460]  referendum because he's God and he says that that's just the way it is for the
[40:35.460 --> 40:40.820]  earth no nothing to do with the earth Congress by the way said no to this they
[40:40.820 --> 40:44.820]  don't care and it's happening where he lives in North Carolina David Knight
[40:44.820 --> 40:50.340]  you've got the floor to break down this in a report it's not just happening in
[40:50.340 --> 40:53.100]  Austin it's not just happening in the US it's happening from Australia to
[40:53.100 --> 40:58.220]  Canada they promised a post-industrial world they're gonna charge us a lot more
[40:58.220 --> 41:03.900]  for a lot less total insider mafia crony monopoly system tell us about it well
[41:03.900 --> 41:07.580]  yeah things are going up in price even as we have less electricity being used in
[41:07.580 --> 41:13.180]  North Carolina we just had Duke Powers stock prices just went up because even
[41:13.180 --> 41:18.980]  though we've had it having a mild summer there their their actual profits went up
[41:18.980 --> 41:24.740]  because they're charging people more and what they've had happen is the they've
[41:24.740 --> 41:28.540]  they had two of the largest utility companies in the country merged in July
[41:28.540 --> 41:31.740]  and so now they've got the largest public utility company in the in the
[41:31.740 --> 41:35.420]  country and one of the things that was a condition was that they've got a very
[41:35.420 --> 41:40.980]  Duke power has a very controversial CEO who has been very involved in politics
[41:40.980 --> 41:43.860]  he gave a ten million dollar line of credit to the Democrats for their
[41:43.860 --> 41:47.820]  national convention in Charlotte and so it was a condition that he was not going
[41:47.820 --> 41:55.700]  to be the head of the new the new merged entity and after 20 minutes he
[41:55.700 --> 42:01.300]  fired the other guy Johnson who was head of Progress Energy and they kind of you
[42:01.300 --> 42:06.100]  know I put in a coup there and the guy got paid $44 million for 20 minutes of
[42:06.100 --> 42:09.940]  work plus the ten million dollar severance pay and that's that's the
[42:09.940 --> 42:12.660]  kind of things that we're seeing in our power you know that's coming through
[42:12.660 --> 42:16.540]  there we've also because who wants to compete and try to get more power to
[42:16.540 --> 42:20.580]  America China can have three new plants a week we can have none a year shut down
[42:20.580 --> 42:25.220]  hundreds I mean it's it's again it's it's bank robbery by another means shut
[42:25.220 --> 42:29.180]  down the other power plants charge more for yours it's very simple right yeah
[42:29.180 --> 42:32.540]  they're shutting down a third of the coal power plants and a lot of them that
[42:32.540 --> 42:35.500]  were scheduled to shut down next year they're accelerating that so they're
[42:35.500 --> 42:39.980]  gonna be shut down as of October the first hope everyone enjoys it yeah yeah
[42:39.980 --> 42:42.620]  and what they're doing is they say they're gonna replace the capacity but
[42:42.620 --> 42:48.100]  they're replacing it with very expensive kind of a boutique power schemes scams
[42:48.100 --> 42:52.940]  little exactly little payoff to the locals you know the mayor's cousin gets
[42:52.940 --> 42:56.420]  to have a biofuel thing it's really a wood burning system well you got one of
[42:56.420 --> 43:00.500]  the most profitable country companies in the country Apple computer was paid a
[43:00.500 --> 43:04.900]  huge subsidy to relocate their server farm to North Carolina and now they're
[43:04.900 --> 43:08.980]  they're going to create the largest fuel cell private fuel cell whilst the
[43:08.980 --> 43:13.700]  largest public or private energy production now they're gonna sell that
[43:13.700 --> 43:17.900]  back into the grid and so the tax the rate payers are gonna be paying for that
[43:17.900 --> 43:22.660]  they make you pay for their super expensive energy and make you pay with
[43:22.660 --> 43:26.700]  tax money to build it right I mean Al Gore what a piece of trash yeah well
[43:26.700 --> 43:29.740]  it's green PR for Apple they look good because they're doing this new meanwhile
[43:29.740 --> 43:32.500]  they have to put suicide nets up around their factories because of the most
[43:32.500 --> 43:37.100]  greedy company in China right right just absolute murdering criminals well
[43:37.100 --> 43:40.420]  what's driving all this is renewable energy mandates and it's something that
[43:40.420 --> 43:44.540]  30 states have and it says they've got to have a certain percentage of their
[43:44.540 --> 43:50.220]  power produced by renewable sources okay so be things like when farms and solar
[43:50.220 --> 43:53.700]  and that sort of thing but those power sources aren't there for the grid in
[43:53.700 --> 43:56.940]  other words if you want to use a solar well they bankrupted Spain yeah yeah
[43:56.940 --> 44:00.060]  exactly if you want to use solar you know for your own purpose or wind power
[44:00.060 --> 44:02.980]  that's fine it's going to be a little bit more expensive but you're off the
[44:02.980 --> 44:06.340]  grid and you've got a way to back and you don't lose power transmitting at far
[44:06.340 --> 44:10.580]  distances right right exactly I did a video for American tradition Institute
[44:10.580 --> 44:15.660]  and in that we showed how when they when they use it in the grid it's gonna
[44:15.660 --> 44:19.220]  fluctuate just like you got a car in traffic okay so they're gonna have to
[44:19.220 --> 44:23.140]  they're gonna have to back it up with a coal power plant and that coal power
[44:23.140 --> 44:28.020]  plant is going to be going up and down and it's just like you know you use more
[44:28.020 --> 44:31.620]  fuel if you're going you're starting and stopping and traffic the same thing
[44:31.620 --> 44:34.780]  happens with a with a power and it's not just that it doesn't work good they
[44:34.780 --> 44:38.900]  know that it's a seizure of power and the cover is all this cobbled together
[44:38.900 --> 44:43.060]  junk right right it's a veneer it looks good that they've got that but they
[44:43.060 --> 44:46.780]  can't actually produce effective power with it even in Ireland they thought if
[44:46.780 --> 44:50.740]  they spread the wind farms out over a larger area that it would kind of you
[44:50.740 --> 44:54.660]  know well they're giant ugly eyesores that kill the birds and they don't work
[44:54.660 --> 44:58.820]  yeah and the amount of energy going into building them is a giant ripoff it's
[44:58.820 --> 45:01.540]  just about these control freaks running everything right but even when they
[45:01.540 --> 45:05.300]  spread the wind farm out of the whole coast of Ireland they still couldn't get
[45:05.300 --> 45:09.300]  steady state out but all we got was higher peaks and and deeper troughs you
[45:09.300 --> 45:12.860]  know but Chalcescu in Romania it turned out he could have had power for the
[45:12.860 --> 45:17.380]  country but he enjoyed having his own private city palace always having light
[45:17.380 --> 45:22.060]  and no one else having it it's like North Korea this is a tool of control yeah
[45:22.060 --> 45:25.780]  in fact they say in Austin the government district will always have power
[45:25.780 --> 45:31.380]  but they say get used to power outages yeah this is just the way it is well
[45:31.380 --> 45:36.620]  it's part of the agenda 21 thing because you know the the economy is as well as
[45:36.620 --> 45:40.740]  life expectancy is really based on the supply of cheap affordable energy and our
[45:40.740 --> 45:43.860]  life expectancy is going down mission accomplished and if they take that away
[45:43.860 --> 45:47.460]  that's that that's really going to destroy everything we'll run over those
[45:47.460 --> 45:51.420]  notes you've got you're an expert on this well basically I was just gonna say
[45:51.420 --> 45:56.780]  you know it Rogers has been you know he gave this line of credit to to the
[45:56.780 --> 46:00.460]  Democrats for their convention and you know made it made a big point of the
[46:00.460 --> 46:04.180]  fact that it wasn't actually donated by Duke power but you know the line of
[46:04.180 --> 46:08.860]  credit is going to them as this merger is being put through right and and he's
[46:08.860 --> 46:12.900]  also one of the biggest proponents of carbon credits you know cap and trade
[46:12.900 --> 46:15.500]  and that sort of thing so he knows that he's gonna make a lot of money out of
[46:15.500 --> 46:22.180]  that and you know it's a it's really a scam and they lie and and say we've got
[46:22.180 --> 46:26.060]  to get rid of the carbon because explain people the new coal plants nothing
[46:26.060 --> 46:29.140]  comes out they have aircraft that fly where they have sensors on them the
[46:29.140 --> 46:33.140]  huge fines of anything comes out like sulfur all that's coming out after the
[46:33.140 --> 46:37.780]  scrubbers is water vapor and carbon dioxide they know that it's good for
[46:37.780 --> 46:41.700]  the environment and they've got these idiots dancing around saying boost my
[46:41.700 --> 46:47.860]  power prices austerity is good for the earth yeah yeah well then in this area
[46:47.860 --> 46:52.780]  progress energy which has now been subsumed into Duke they're one of the
[46:52.780 --> 46:56.660]  largest have not the largest running nuclear power so they're they're going
[46:56.660 --> 46:59.980]  to a lot of nuclear and we've got a nuclear power plant not too far from
[46:59.980 --> 47:03.980]  where we live and you see the smoke flume going up and it is just water vapor
[47:03.980 --> 47:06.660]  but you know hopefully it's just water vapor hopefully there's nothing else in
[47:06.660 --> 47:10.140]  there but you know after looking at Fukushima and looking at the the cost
[47:10.140 --> 47:13.380]  down the road of decommissioning these plants because they can only run for a
[47:13.380 --> 47:16.020]  couple of decades and then they got to decommission them and you got to store
[47:16.020 --> 47:19.020]  that stuff but they don't know they just keep running until they rot and blow up
[47:19.020 --> 47:22.420]  right right and so you know you've got that that safety issue now that we've
[47:22.420 --> 47:25.780]  seen and we're all aware of now after Fukushima and yeah we've got to have
[47:25.780 --> 47:29.700]  radiation because carbon dioxide plants breathe is evil because Al Gore the pig
[47:29.700 --> 47:33.580]  runs a company with Obama and the Rothschilds where you've got to pay him
[47:33.580 --> 47:38.820]  money for it yeah exactly yeah there's not any there's not any global warming
[47:38.820 --> 47:44.500]  that's going on and if you look at the the climate gate reports I mean there was
[47:44.500 --> 47:48.260]  like a thousand emails leaked and then just last year there was another 5,000
[47:48.260 --> 47:52.380]  leaked and these guys are conspiring to tell people lies and it's very clear
[47:52.380 --> 47:56.740]  well they do stuff like sticks or mometers they got caught on tarmac's in
[47:56.740 --> 48:01.980]  and the street or rooftops where it's 10 degrees higher exactly what they've
[48:01.980 --> 48:07.900]  done to put these and Apple has put in the this gigantic solar power area and
[48:07.900 --> 48:10.820]  they're also going to put in this fuel cell area and they have slashed and
[48:10.820 --> 48:15.300]  burned tremendous amounts of forest you know to put this in so well there's
[48:15.300 --> 48:19.140]  nothing hogging more power than those servers yeah I said we put a tax on them
[48:19.140 --> 48:24.260]  right yeah yeah so over some more your notes I mean I'm ranting here this is
[48:24.260 --> 48:27.220]  just incredible to have our mayor in Austin say you're not gonna have a
[48:27.220 --> 48:31.940]  referendum and we're gonna shut down the third city on power plant and yeah it's
[48:31.940 --> 48:36.060]  gonna increase your prices again suck on it and just annihilate people on fixed
[48:36.060 --> 48:39.700]  incomes my grandmother half the time I go over there has the windows open it's
[48:39.700 --> 48:44.420]  100 degrees inside and she won't do it because the power bill is too high yeah
[48:44.420 --> 48:48.060]  yeah well one of the things that that they're they're pushing even more so
[48:48.060 --> 48:52.220]  than carbon dioxide and reducing greenhouse gases one of the most
[48:52.220 --> 48:57.620]  effective things that they've had is to measure particulate matter and they just
[48:57.620 --> 49:02.180]  had an experiment and real closer where we live in Chapel Hill you know and see
[49:02.180 --> 49:06.980]  and what they did was they did they did tests on human beings exposing them to
[49:06.980 --> 49:11.340]  stuff now you've had the director of the EPA Lisa Jackson testified before
[49:11.340 --> 49:14.940]  Congress and said that particulate matter is responsible for killing as many
[49:14.940 --> 49:19.940]  people as cancer and that's ridiculous that's just a bold-faced lie okay but
[49:19.940 --> 49:24.180]  they clearly don't believe it or if they do they're acting like Nazi doctors
[49:24.180 --> 49:28.060]  because what they did was they took at least 40 people and they exposed them to
[49:28.060 --> 49:32.620]  levels that were anywhere from 25 to 70 times what they said were safe levels
[49:32.620 --> 49:35.660]  you don't experiment on people like that it's illegal yeah you don't
[49:35.660 --> 49:40.020]  experience it violates ethical codes but expanding they've put out in Texas
[49:40.020 --> 49:43.620]  because the main jet stream that comes out of China dumps right over Texas for
[49:43.620 --> 49:48.300]  whatever reason there's no controls on those it's Chinese particulate but then
[49:48.300 --> 49:53.900]  they blame locals for the toxic waste dumping in on it it's amazing you know
[49:53.900 --> 49:57.500]  Al Gore telling China to clean up their power plants that's right that's right
[49:57.500 --> 50:02.260]  yeah it's it's a it's a and clearly you know this all came in this this stuff
[50:02.260 --> 50:05.420]  about the EPA experiments that all came in about the time we remember about a
[50:05.420 --> 50:09.940]  year ago they were talking about regulating the dust on farms you know
[50:09.940 --> 50:14.020]  hay dust yeah everybody got upset about that and then the EPA enough people
[50:14.020 --> 50:18.100]  kicked back on it that the EPA said no no no we'd never intended to regulate
[50:18.100 --> 50:22.820]  dust on farms but at the same time they were trying to find they were working
[50:22.820 --> 50:27.740]  really hard they had one person who already had a physical congenital problem
[50:27.740 --> 50:30.860]  with her heart and she had an issue she had an episode and so they wrote a
[50:30.860 --> 50:35.660]  paper on that the fellow named Steve Malloy who has a website called junk
[50:35.660 --> 50:39.900]  science.com he noticed that and he started digging and running freedom of
[50:39.900 --> 50:43.620]  information requests on it and he found out that there were 41 people that
[50:43.620 --> 50:46.720]  they'd actually done that with and he thinks it may be as many as 150 but he's
[50:46.720 --> 50:49.540]  having to try to pull that information yeah we need to you need to get a hold
[50:49.540 --> 50:53.180]  him and do a report on that for him fall wars nightly news let's come back and talk
[50:53.180 --> 50:56.820]  about some other facets of this and how much the power prices are getting ready

[54:21.780 --> 54:31.380]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we are breaking down the takeover of our
[54:31.380 --> 54:38.860]  society we're gonna have open phones in the second hour that's coming up
[54:38.860 --> 54:42.700]  Holland Van der Neuenhoff dealing with false flag terror attacks and this
[54:42.700 --> 54:46.780]  current Justice Department is going to be joining us as well and we'll have open
[54:46.780 --> 54:53.180]  phones then in the third hour today I will get more into what IRS whistleblowers
[54:53.180 --> 55:00.100]  are telling me coming up but going back to David Knight David you know I mean
[55:00.100 --> 55:03.020]  people talk about how the globalists want to destroy free societies they want
[55:03.020 --> 55:10.660]  to bankrupt people I mean clearly that's what's happening here right now I mean
[55:10.660 --> 55:15.820]  we have seen the power double in the last ten years since they shut down two
[55:15.820 --> 55:18.860]  of the city run plants now they're shutting down the third and they just
[55:18.860 --> 55:21.700]  say that's the way it is and this is all over the country this is happening and
[55:21.700 --> 55:25.380]  there's nothing coming out of them but they show school kids look at the dirty
[55:25.380 --> 55:30.980]  smoke and it's water vapor and but then they tell them reactors are good and
[55:30.980 --> 55:36.380]  it's literally just a giant ripoff they say they don't want us to have energy
[55:36.380 --> 55:39.980]  they say we have too much industry because the globalists have all
[55:39.980 --> 55:43.380]  invested in China they know they're just making their investment go up see
[55:43.380 --> 55:47.740]  because they control the society they make profits when they shut us down
[55:47.740 --> 55:51.420]  plus we've been a free society they want to bring us to our knees well if you
[55:51.420 --> 55:54.340]  look at where these renewable energy mandates are and the 30 states where
[55:54.340 --> 55:56.900]  they have them where they've been in place for a while the electricity is
[55:56.900 --> 56:00.820]  about double what it is in places that don't have those mandates and the
[56:00.820 --> 56:04.620]  problem is is that you know people look at wind power and they think oh when
[56:04.620 --> 56:09.060]  that's clean and free it's I mean you're just just capturing it right well you
[56:09.060 --> 56:13.020]  know coal is free but you got to get it out of the ground you got to build a
[56:13.020 --> 56:16.900]  plant to process it you know and and you got to be able to distribute it same
[56:16.900 --> 56:20.540]  thing is true of wind you've got to have a way to harness that and the wind
[56:20.540 --> 56:23.700]  turbines are very expensive they don't last forever you know they wear out
[56:23.700 --> 56:27.740]  fairly quickly so you know there is a huge expense and actually it's more
[56:27.740 --> 56:32.060]  expensive than coal is to do or some of the fossil fuels but again it so it
[56:32.060 --> 56:38.260]  really goes back to this agenda with the carbon credits and the CO2 gases is
[56:38.260 --> 56:41.540]  what they're they're selling in the global war also I hear people go oh you
[56:41.540 --> 56:45.300]  must work for the oil companies Alex no no a lot of the big oil companies don't
[56:45.300 --> 56:48.900]  like coal because they compete with it and coal is broken up into a bunch of
[56:48.900 --> 56:53.100]  companies it's not a big monopoly that's why it's so cheap it's everywhere they
[56:53.100 --> 56:59.140]  all want it shut down the system wants it shut down because it has powered the
[56:59.140 --> 57:03.740]  industrial revolution they take the coke that's left after the coals burned they
[57:03.740 --> 57:08.740]  put it into the steel I mean it is a magic thing and we've got enough to run
[57:08.740 --> 57:12.500]  this country I've seen statistics of thousands of years I mean how much of
[57:12.500 --> 57:15.640]  this stuff is there's more coal here than there is in the and oil in the
[57:15.640 --> 57:19.100]  Middle East and that's not even including things like the oil shell which
[57:19.100 --> 57:23.020]  is the fields up in Canada they're trying to remember Clinton blocking the
[57:23.020 --> 57:26.940]  claim burning coal in the late 90s that one big deposit in Utah the only other
[57:26.940 --> 57:32.380]  deposit was in China yeah well you know they talk about how this this coal that
[57:32.380 --> 57:36.660]  they're trying to get from the fields and in Canada through the the XL the
[57:36.660 --> 57:40.100]  Keystone XL project you know they're trying to get approval to run a pipeline
[57:40.100 --> 57:43.820]  down the refineries and if they don't do it that stuff is still going to be sold
[57:43.820 --> 57:47.700]  to China so if we don't refine it in America and make American jobs it's
[57:47.700 --> 57:51.340]  still going to go to China Chinese because everything there is is controlled
[57:51.340 --> 57:54.780]  by the government they're not nearly as concerned about doing things cleanly as
[57:54.780 --> 57:59.760]  we are here in the US right so either way it's gonna you know if they say it's
[57:59.760 --> 58:02.260]  gonna cut down global warming it's not good you know it's not gonna cut they
[58:02.260 --> 58:07.060]  have major rivers catch on fire but again it's it's it's not even about the
[58:07.060 --> 58:10.180]  environment it is a cold-blooded takeover exactly what are these average
[58:10.180 --> 58:14.340]  environmentalists gonna think as they see their power prices go up and up well
[58:14.340 --> 58:18.940]  you know a lot of them are real real earth-firsters you know real luddites you
[58:18.940 --> 58:22.500]  know they want to see everything go down they want to see population reduction
[58:22.500 --> 58:26.580]  they they want to see us go back to a pre-industrial society that's really part
[58:26.580 --> 58:30.900]  of the agenda 21 agenda you know yeah until they grow up and then try to have
[58:30.900 --> 58:34.980]  their firstborn in the child dies because mommy's been taking vaccines then
[58:34.980 --> 58:40.500]  when the death hits your doorstep you'll wish you to stood up
[58:42.620 --> 58:51.860]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network the worst drought in 50
[58:51.860 --> 58:55.860]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[58:55.860 --> 59:00.820]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[59:00.820 --> 59:05.580]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[59:05.580 --> 59:09.220]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up
[59:09.220 --> 59:13.140]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food
[59:13.140 --> 59:17.340]  cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct
[59:17.340 --> 59:20.980]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise
[59:20.980 --> 59:24.900]  prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply
[59:24.900 --> 59:28.060]  for me foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about
[59:28.060 --> 59:32.300]  their delicious long-term storable foods the fact is you can eat at any time to
[59:32.300 --> 59:35.780]  save money today and because it stores for 25 years you're locking in today's
[59:35.780 --> 59:41.180]  prices and avoiding the rising food cost don't wait call 800 409 5633 or go to

[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:57.220]  man I've had liberal black folks on this show and they just say well I like
[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.020]  abortion but then a black guy gets shot in the head it's the end of the world
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.540]  but you know kill more blacks have been killed since Roe v. Wade and been born
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.780]  and I'm like I don't want to kill the black people and they're like well
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.060]  that's cuz you're racist you really love me and we're liberal you'd want to chop

[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.860]  of info wars calm and see in the inside this place it's amazing it really is
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.660]  kind of surreal to be here with you after after watching you on TV and
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.100]  listening to it but it's a real professional operation it's great well
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:49.020]  we're trying to be professional it is it is very professional if you do end up
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:56.340]  being a reporter down here which I think you know again is 95% there so what
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:00.500]  are you looking forward to doing most well you know I think one of the things
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.780]  that really puts people in it is documentaries and so yeah I'd like to
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.420]  try to fill in some details you know for people who are new listeners try to
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.020]  give them a background and a lot of the stuff you throw a lot of terms out that
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.300]  you know people have been listening for a while understand but you know maybe
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.340]  pull some stuff in from your documentaries pull some do some special
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.380]  reports or whatever to give people kind of a glossary I agree we know I've
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.980]  always said this my wife said everybody we need a frequently asked
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:31.380]  questions area the basics what is the New World Order what is agenda 21 what is
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:36.500]  false flag what is the attack on the family right right because you've got
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.980]  you've gone into a lot of detail on that on a lot of the documentaries but you
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.620]  know without somebody sitting all the way through the documentary just pulling
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.740]  out something that they can get their hand get a handle we need lots of ten
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:50.140]  minute blurblitz yep I think so exactly that's what that's why I'm just like all
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:55.100]  in we're gonna get six reporters to make reports many documentaries I really
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.540]  want to get a big enough crew here where I can go back to documentary film
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.860]  making it's been two years just launching the nightly news trying to get
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.740]  built up to this level trying to raise the capital spending time on sales I
[01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.860]  never used to even worry about capitalizing now I'm like I'm gonna
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.420]  try to get as much money in here as I can so we can expand and be strong in
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.780]  the face of this and they you know they could shut us down tomorrow but that
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.500]  will only blow up in their face but the point is I don't want to look back later
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.540]  and wish I'd have done more well I think your newspaper is a great idea I mean it
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:27.660]  and the area where I live now Chapel Hill we've got a very liberal very Marxist
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.620]  paper actually called the independent and it would be a great counter to that I
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.140]  think there'd be a lot of businesses that would be a lot more comfortable
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.500]  advertising with somebody's all about what we need people to step up and
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.860]  that's the whole franchisee plan once we beta test it and show people it's
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.460]  already profitable the first month it comes out in September we'll start
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.900]  printing it in about three weeks or no two weeks man time's flying but but the
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:53.340]  point is is that it is that it'll be our news but a space for the local news and
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.940]  then people get half the ad space and I mean that's gonna be the plan yeah but
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:02.180]  and I mean again people like well Prince dying it's dying because it's a bunch
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:07.540]  of propaganda the establishment Internet is dying too right right and talk
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.980]  radio there was a lot of talk radio where they just rehash talking points for
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:14.860]  Fox News it's really you know people are turning that it's controlled right wing
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:19.500]  just to control the constitutional right right right it's just a just a
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:25.260]  party party voice you know we were number one in our Orlando station number
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:30.700]  one in the people meters great station went spoke there had over it was almost
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.220]  2,000 people show up and then they just changed formats they said yeah we got top
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.180]  ratings it's great but where we have you know we're going back to the other
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.500]  format you know that happens but it's like we even get the top ratings and it
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.540]  isn't good enough you know we beat Rush Limbaugh in Orlando just absolutely
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.620]  they were from like number six on the ratings the number one with me yeah I'm
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.380]  right pull the whole station up to number two just devastated the
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.380]  competition in a year and then they just switch formats we'll be back stay with
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:01.380]  us

[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.740]  issues we covered in the last hour any of the news items as you've seen the news
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:01.460]  you'd like to talk about I noticed there were like four big B attacks across the
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.020]  country here in the US imagine if that was a mass shooting the type of
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:08.940]  hysteria and we'd be a hearing right now because bees kill more people every
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.420]  year as I've pointed out at nauseam then guns do in mass shootings we also have a
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:19.380]  report up at info wars.com by Matthew T Williams from brothers and arms gun show
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:26.100]  we do how do you survive a theater style shooting that report is up there
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:32.060]  right now now I mentioned this I talked about it some in the last hour and you
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:36.100]  heard me last Wednesday say I have two IRS whistleblowers that one of them
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.140]  been talking to for three years the other just the last year or so but the
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:46.060]  last month or so fast and furious pun intended we have been talking about just
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:50.980]  a mutiny at the biggest IRS center that covers five states based in Austin Texas
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:57.340]  literally miles from where I sit giant IRS center biggest employer in Austin
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:02.500]  Texas collection agency for the private fellow reserve they are being ordered
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.100]  basically with no due process even to take retirees homes as they've
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.380]  retroactively changed tax laws on pensions and things that's got them
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.820]  upset because they're even trying to take some of the IRS people's property
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:18.180]  who have been retired but are back in the workforce they are being ordered
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.820]  now here's the big news that's not in the Associated Press and Reuters in the
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:26.620]  last two days they have been forced to report on this because last week I said
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:29.860]  we were gonna have a whistleblower report soon dealing with illegal aliens
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:34.740]  being given tax ID numbers you heard us talk about it last week and I was just
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:40.540]  collating the data and actually I was mentioning this last week and CJ just
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:46.180]  brought in a accounting today article IRS discouraged employees from
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:52.820]  identifying fraudulent ITIN applications that fake tax ID numbers which
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:12:00.900]  they can then get tax returns they can get tax paybacks for children and they
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.940]  go after citizens if they do this this is very legal aliens it's part of the
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:13.380]  incentive and they report 2.9 million ITIN or 6.8 billion in 2011 and the word
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:19.300]  is it's a lot bigger than this I was told by one of these people about
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:25.220]  addresses in Austin where hundreds of thousands of dollars a year goes I mean
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.260]  they'll do 20 30 40 50 that's what I was saying and he ran in here CJ was
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.860]  searched what I was saying is a lot of this if these whistleblowers are like
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.980]  look some of this is already public this is months ago you got to look into it
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.940]  you got to cover it and then the last few weeks they're like look this is
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.940]  really coming to a head morale has collapsed because we realize we're
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:47.820]  doing total criminal activity and our higher ups they continue it but here's
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:53.620]  what hasn't been broken yet well let me get this first 150 and again this is
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.500]  admitted down to have broken out of Austin 154 mailing addresses that were
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.300]  used in 1000 or more of the ITIN applications 10 individual addresses
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:09.860]  were used for filing 53,994 tax returns resulting in the processing of
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:15.820]  86.4 million in fraudulent tax see I hadn't seen this CJ ran in I was talking
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:22.100]  about hundreds of thousands 400 500 thousand at one Austin address I was
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:26.340]  like give me an example the fraud they go half a million at one address hundreds
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:32.660]  of tax returns see and I'm sorry it's worse than that this is just what my
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.620]  whistleblowers are telling me because I'm right in the middle of the biggest
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:41.100]  IRS command center in the country 154 mailing addresses were used 1000 or
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:46.980]  more times on ITIN applications 10 individual addresses were used for
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:57.220]  filing 53,994 tax returns I mean huge huge information here and it's in the
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.340]  Associated Press they were ordered to stand down and they've told them they
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:04.580]  will prosecute them what did the ATF head say two weeks ago he put out a video
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.700]  that by the way said restricted they weren't supposed to release it as if
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.420]  they're the CIA and said we're gonna grind down on you that's a quote we're
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.860]  gonna come after you if you release any information you must go through the
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:21.180]  agency an agency that bombed Oklahoma City and blew up Waco and that's who
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.780]  get it the ATF we've talked to the cops that were there and these are killers
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:29.340]  folks these are murdering terrorists at the top now is there some ATFs that
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:33.020]  aren't criminals well surely that's why this stuff got leaked but they're
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:40.420]  telling them we're gonna come after you this is very good look the skies the
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.740]  limit they've gotten away with all this they'll get away with anything and if
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.900]  you think all this is just gonna end with Mitt Romney you got another thing
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.460]  coming sure it repudiates the system if you get a one-term president but they
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:55.260]  have to go to jail to stop this they're going for broke folks they're shutting
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.060]  down a third of the power plants nationwide conservatively right now do
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:04.300]  you have any idea what that's gonna do to our economy they knew full well when
[01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:09.300]  they put a 20 percent tax two years ago in California that it would take a 22
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.620]  percent unemployment rate and push it past 30 and now it has it's a value added
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:18.180]  that you don't see in the bottom line but it's added to the price you don't
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:23.340]  see them say it's a tax but you get it these are criminals folks we have been
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:30.660]  seized by absolute filth and of course they give the illegal aliens free money
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:34.780]  and they admit that's who's getting it and citizens aren't allowed to they
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.220]  want an incentive to bring the illegals here to vote for gun control and
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.900]  tyranny they've got we've got a report of a hundred million Americans on
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:47.980]  welfare now 100 million and they think the government's their friend as the
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:52.820]  economy gets worse and worse many people say okay I drop out I go on welfare
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.580]  meanwhile the system is going after eliminate stands gardens Amish people
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:03.980]  selling tomatoes on the side of the highway and why is that because they
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:08.780]  cannot allow that they're banning cash all over the country in secondhand sales
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:13.340]  don't believe me just type in state bans cash in secondhand sales multiple
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:18.020]  states they're coming they mean business they're arresting women when
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:22.300]  their kids draw with chalk on the sidewalk a son and little house with
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:26.260]  tulips growing like my daughter's doing the sidewalk you're arrested you're
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:32.500]  fine you're going to jail because they want normal people to learn to be
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.780]  prisoners just like in Russia just like in Nazi Germany just like in China or
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:41.500]  Cuba it's over if we don't wake up now they mean business and they will
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.780]  announce guns are banned they got the bills introduced they will start a civil
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:54.820]  war in this country these are larceness they enjoy the the robbing banks they
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.900]  just learned how to rob societies they like the fact they're in danger they
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.980]  like the fact that they could go to prison like Madoff and and and Ken Lee
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:08.340]  these are maniacs folks criminals of this mastermind level do it because they
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:12.220]  like it okay people are like well I want to screw up the most successful
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:17.660]  economy in the world because they want to dominate everything don't you
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:23.420]  understand how much danger we're in do any of you have any idea how much
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:32.340]  danger we're in right now we are in so much trouble now here's the big news
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:37.500]  that is not in the I mean they admit it's being used to steal identities but
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:42.180]  the IRS is not just in a mutiny and having a crisis of conscience like
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:47.900]  people had in Romania against El Chescu or Operation Valkyrie against Hitler
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:51.220]  but it's more political because they're really realizing just how criminal they
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:55.140]  are I mean they're complicit in it just saying oh whistle-blowing I can't tell
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:58.340]  you that doesn't cover what they've done they all know they're involved in crime
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:03.100]  right now massive crime that's ruining lives I mean they jerk the wedding rings
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:09.100]  off people's hands as they retroactively change laws to to set you up I mean it's
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:15.620]  about imploding here's the big secret millions of people a year the number is
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.180]  five million and I'm actually finding this out there hidden in plain view five
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.780]  million people the IRS goes after the year at least we're having their identity
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:27.940]  taken by organized crime syndicates and governments Russia China you name it our
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:32.660]  own criminal so-called government governments are releasing social
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:35.500]  security numbers on purpose the Comptroller didn't release those in
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:39.620]  Texas by accident a Bank of America doesn't release millions by accident they
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.020]  were released them show because it's a form of weaponized attack on America and
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:47.820]  other free societies with these tax ID numbers even though they don't match the
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:55.740]  social security numbers now when you when you go in and it the IRS won't even
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.340]  tell you when they've got you red flagged your identity's been taken they
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:04.380]  consider it you when the illegals or the crime syndicates both do it sit there
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.060]  and take your identity and get all this money you are gonna have your bank
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:13.540]  account hit and it's been going on for years now but it's building your bank
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:18.700]  account is hit the IRS takes your money saying you did fraudulent tax returns

[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:32.340]  I mean this is power folks this is siege cutting our power off letting the
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:36.540]  illegals and foreign governments jack up bills in our name I mean they are gonna
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:40.220]  gut this country one way or the other 22 billion to ship General Motors
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:46.340]  overseas carbon taxes to shut us down I mean we're under attack the Federal
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:51.300]  Reserve wants this country destroyed and they take the stimulus money and give it
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:55.060]  to offshore corporations to further bankrupt us I mean they know what

[01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:15.740]  White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:20.780]  healer now 27 years later carnivore capsules are used around the world to

[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:15.820]  foot six and waited 245 kind of broad at his shoulder and there at the hip and
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:22.540]  everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John. So bottom line here's what's
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:26.540]  happening at the IRS they're being ordered with retroactive fake laws to
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:30.980]  just rob 70 plus percent of the money they're getting is just robbing retirees
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:35.980]  taking everything they got their houses wedding rings everything it's just
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:39.740]  decimating their ranks so they're mainly just hiring illegals and foreigners
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:41.620]  they'll do anything they're told for whatever reason that's who they're
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.900]  hiring and like CPS in England's a bunch of foreigners don't even speak English
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:51.020]  kidnapping the kids and now they are told it doesn't matter if somebody stole
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.340]  that person's identity and did fraud in their name take their bank account and
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:25:00.380]  they salute and take your account and ruin your life and feel bad about it but
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:03.900]  it doesn't matter you know those that feel bad will get out just like TSA and
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:08.940]  those that enjoy it the criminal conversion will happen until now the TSA
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:13.780]  runs your background to make sure you're a criminal before they hire you they
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.220]  discover you're a criminal you get the command job oh you're a pedophile you're

[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:57.020]  here to wipe the snout of criminals and you know what we put up with it so we
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:04.540]  deserve it land of the pathetic cowards home of the stupid slaves
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:12.180]  so I know the IRS is listing in Austin Texas people are always like you
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:15.100]  criticize the IRS aren't you worried about getting arrested no most of them
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:20.380]  listen and know the truth most of them know it's criminal they don't like it
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:24.220]  hey that isn't enough to not like it you got to come out you've got to fight it
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.580]  there's a little listen this is only going to get worse if we don't start
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:30.340]  speaking out folks
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:36.220]  oh it see it wasn't about wealth redistribution help the poor was it you
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:39.060]  know what it's really about it's about shipping that money to offshore banks
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:44.020]  isn't it they feel good taking old people's houses all day to feel good
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.740]  taking people's bank accounts because somebody stole their identity and you
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:53.380]  know it and you gave the codes out so they could do it does it feel good no
[01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:57.300]  it doesn't feel good but you know what the new order knows what they're doing
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:05.620]  they know you're all gonna leave and they're just gonna hire crooks and then
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:11.460]  the real fun's gonna start isn't it yeah tyrants have got this all figured out
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:16.460]  don't they the public isn't gonna figure it out till everything we've got
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:22.900]  taken until the globalists lead us into a giant world war like they always do and
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.660]  if the globalists succeed they'll then reduce our population and the rest of it
[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:32.060]  and it doesn't matter though because the American team beat the American team in
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:37.180]  volleyball last night and she thanked the troops like she always does miss may
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.740]  thank the troops which doesn't really help the troops that she should have said
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.580]  it's wrong you're taking the death benefits of the troops because she
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.740]  doesn't know that it's up to us to educate her but if we did was she know
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:50.700]  it said it's I support the troops which means support put the troops in a meat
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:54.260]  grinder which means do what you're told support the troops just just throw that

[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:42.500]  kids he did you used to use cocaine and his and his wife so he took the kids as
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:47.100]  they normally do so my wife she never did none of that so she tried to take you
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.380]  know I'm constantly they kept fighting her but guess who came in it was
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:58.260]  Homeland Security and what happened they kept fighting her they won't let her
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.100]  see her the kids he says he saw them one time they looked kind of drugged up yeah
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:07.420]  Homeland Security is into everything now and well I've got the report right
[01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:11.520]  here you got to kill the ugly black babies so if they can't kill them
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.020]  physically they're gonna try to kill their brains how old are these victims
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:20.820]  now in the clutches of the Jerry Sandusky Homeland Force three and four and
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.900]  yes they are black I am African-American yeah well they want to kill them so they
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:28.900]  probably will well I'm sorry to hear that the Homeland Security's got them
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:32.020]  they're gonna try to brain damage them and then dump them out on the street as the
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:36.820]  zombies when they're 18 so Homeland Security of course you can't let a
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:41.060]  family member that the CPS fights to make sure children aren't given to
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:45.100]  families but I'm sorry that you can't get the black leaders to help you their
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:50.740]  jobs make sure all the blacks are killed as quickly as possible as well we're on

[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:36.220]  Jones you know it tears my guts out when people like the last caller call up
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:41.380]  and talk about little children being taken by the CPS because even though
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:46.700]  society is degenerating and a lot of parents are bad the Justice Department's
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:53.620]  own numbers last time I checked was that you were five to seven times depending
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:34:00.140]  on what state the average is about five times to be abused by CPS then in any
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:09.140]  other environment it is literally swimming with pedophiles and that's on
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:19.660]  record children die seven times more often two-thirds of foster children
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.380]  nationwide are on more than seven psychotropic drugs this is all in the
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:29.580]  news medical doctors that have worked for the CPS have gone public because they
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:33.740]  say yeah we took a healthy five-year-old two years later he was on 12 drugs
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:39.620]  having seizures they did brain surgery on him he's dead yeah that's a woa I
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:44.940]  report they even do medical experiments on him because the CPS gets more money
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:52.780]  though the the more sick your child is and I have seen things myself with the
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:58.380]  CPS covering it back when I was just a local reporter 15 16 years ago that I
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:02.980]  had to stop physically going and covering it because I couldn't handle it
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:07.660]  I mean torturing me is hurting children that that is absolute torture they're
[01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:14.860]  innocent they're good I saw cops a cop choking a woman to make them give up or
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:18.580]  blonde hair blue-eyed baby they can get up to half a million for and I opened the
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:23.980]  door and the cop was choking her and and I had to fight all my instincts I knew
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:30.500]  I took to defeat them I had to stay out of prison so my my absolute hatred of
[01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:35.300]  their evil made me go out but then I started crawling around on the ground
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:40.260]  outside and I called in some talk radio shows couldn't even talk when I got on
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:43.040]  one other than it was John Staten or show broke down crime people thought I
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.020]  was talking about my child but it was my child these are all our children and I
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:52.900]  literally was crawling around on the ground because because in my life if I
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:57.140]  catch a man attacking a woman to kidnap a baby I mean I was just ready ladies
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.980]  and gentlemen to take that guy's head off of my bare arms and it was it was
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:05.420]  the same type smiling leering type you know that they have a specialist to
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:08.820]  take the kids and he was smiling enjoying grabbing the mother by the neck to
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:11.540]  make her sign it and I just happened to come in they you know they called so
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:15.980]  they were pressuring when we got there my handsome was with me he was behind me
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:19.020]  he got some of it on tape and and they're like get out of here get out of
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:24.060]  here and I saw it and became physically nauseous because because I had to
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:32.020]  ignore all of my basic programming as a healthy male to to let them do that and
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:36.260]  it was just it makes me physically feel sick right now I'm not getting I feel
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:41.020]  I'm having flashbacks right now is and people are like oh what's the big deal
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:44.340]  see you've had your humanity taken folks choking a woman to make them take
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:51.500]  their newborn baby for no reason because they're just a poor family and all
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:55.020]  these people are like oh yeah you know blacks deserve to be in prison but you
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:58.940]  know look at them all this black folks have been the test model of all this
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:03.340]  and they and they fan out with a blacks everybody else I'm gonna go to your
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:06.940]  calls I want to play this Paul Watson report and I'll go back to him Margaret
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:10.020]  Singer I didn't just believe the quotes when I made in game I sent off to the
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:15.780]  universities what to the Colgate Foundation and others and Proctor and
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:23.340]  Gamble subgroup where Margaret singers letters about we've got to exterminate
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:27.380]  these black weeds but we've got to pose as liberals to do it and how they were
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:34.020]  gonna break up the family and make abortion sexy and so all of you folks
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:37.460]  that don't like black people out there or scared of black folks most white
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:42.700]  people I know actually admire you know black people and think it's neat and
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:45.820]  whatever because it's what you know different but they're also real scared
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:50.940]  of black people and the media does that on purpose and then the culture of death
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:55.300]  the gangsterism all of that that's sold to black folks and then sold
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.380]  everybody else is pure death they want to abort them culturally if they can't
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:02.980]  abort them in the womb or CPSM and get them on drugs or get them in the
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:07.540]  juvenile justice system and everything that's been tested on the blacks
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:10.420]  government drug dealing in their neighborhoods letting that be the red
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:14.020]  light district that's exported to everybody else and you can see that in
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:23.020]  society in the 40s and 50s the numbers vary but black illegitimacy was 25% or
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:29.860]  so now it's over 90% people spin it and say oh you know what's wrong with not
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:33.020]  having a parent at home the point is is your four or five times more likely
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:37.180]  ended up in prison or on drugs and they know this and they make it fun they
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:40.940]  make it sexy and everybody just turns their daughters over in junior high and
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:44.460]  high school to get pregnant and the most aggressive gangster type come after
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:48.340]  them and then you just have abortions I mean it's just a hellish society done by
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:58.500]  designed to bring us down and they kill 51% of blacks in this country before
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:06.100]  they're born and whites it going back 50 60 years ago it was in single digits
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:15.060]  single parent now it's over 50% and with it all of the stuff that comes with it
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.660]  so this is what feminism was designed to do and hasn't empowered women look at
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:27.900]  where women are look at where the whole society is we're we're destroyed and so
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:32.380]  you know I I engaged in some satire there with the last caller very dark satire
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:37.020]  because it pains me that they've got the little kids and they're gonna they're
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:41.060]  gonna basically kill their brains I even kill them you know they kill them
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:49.220]  quite often it's just like yeah kids died in foster care no big deal you know
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:53.740]  the head of Penn State's now gone to work for Homeland Security in something
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:57.340]  so secret they won't tell us I mean that's who runs this people who like
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:05.020]  hurting kids and so the caller was talking about Homeland Security getting
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:09.460]  involved and yeah they're involved in everything now they're involved they're
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:13.740]  showing up at swap meets and garage sales and arresting people there people are
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:17.540]  like but I'm just selling an old toy they're like well this was recalled ten
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:20.460]  years ago we're a million dollar fine we're taking your house I mean it's
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:25.340]  just creeping federal scum everywhere who worked for terrorists that ship guns
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:29.460]  into Mexico and ship narcotics in from Afghanistan I mean this is a mafia these
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:33.420]  are criminals these are trash these are filth these are murderers these are the
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:36.860]  scum of the earth they're here to overthrow us they're here to eat out
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:43.740]  our substance swarms of bureaucrats sent out to eat out our substance it's here
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:48.060]  and I'm just willing to tell you like it is and risk my life because there's no
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.660]  future if we don't beat them see I did that's why I get so many people say I'm
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:57.240]  a hero I want to make this point for the thousandth time folks this is survival
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:03.540]  you're watching this is fighting back this is somebody recognizing a threat
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:07.780]  18 years ago trying to get into the media getting my own little operation
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:11.420]  building it piece by piece and then everything I've talked about coming
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:14.980]  true as we build towards this and now we've built some momentum against the
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:20.420]  enemy we're at least in the fight because others before me saw the threat even
[01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:26.620]  before I did and then we're all stand on their shoulders together now the
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:31.140]  Department of Energy took more than 4,000 children and radiated them to death
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:36.220]  ladies and gentlemen the admitted declassified reports talk about the
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:44.300]  different dosages sometimes they would melt them like an egg on a skillet to the
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:50.220]  stretcher to the metal table that's who runs the government of people that
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:57.460]  take little kids and put them in a thing and microwave oven them I was at a kid
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:00.500]  house one time in it and I've had nightmares about it because I'll stomp
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:06.860]  on a cockroach but he goes watch this and he grabs a big palmetto bug was in
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:11.220]  Dallas so he was actually a few years old and we were at his brother who was in
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:17.620]  college his apartment and he goes watch this and scoops up a big cockroach and
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:21.500]  puts it in a baggie and puts it in the microwave and I'll never forget that
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:25.060]  roach scabbering around trying to get out of that bag and that bag moving around
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:31.180]  just that it was the torturing of it I have nightmares about it and you imagine
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:35.340]  those little kids being fried down on that I mean that's who runs America in
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:40.580]  the world the apps they think it's strength that's why Satanist sacrifice
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:45.140]  kids it's about the power to take a little baby and Satanist will take hours
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:49.340]  lancing it and sucking the blood and torturing it and I mean I mean it's just
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:53.300]  it's just like what I mean we've got to beat these people there there's not
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:43:05.180]  you're crazy if you just go party and don't care and let the evil grow the
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:09.260]  good people of this country are buying guns we're buying millions a month we
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:15.980]  know who the enemy is we're trying to fix things as best we can but everybody
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:25.380]  has to draw their line in the sand but we are overrun by demons if demons aren't
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:31.860]  real might as well be these people are demons and I've seen them I've looked
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:42.860]  in their eyes I know who they are and reality is so crazy and evil is
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:49.300]  duplicating itself replicating doubling every year now soon it'll be every month
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:54.660]  and then evil will start doubling every week every day every hour that's how it
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:58.140]  works I mean it is just it because they're getting us all just accustomed to
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:02.780]  just a craziness I mean the magnitude of letting them take your two-year-old
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:07.320]  son or daughter and strip them in front of people at the airport or take them
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.980]  crying behind closed doors or some weird creepy pedophile right out of
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.420]  central casting takes your crying five-year-old daughter behind closed
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:22.180]  doors we abort our babies of course we're going into hell you we lie to

[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:47.860]  thing you know it was in the first trimester and you made excuses or whatever
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:54.540]  it's another thing to say I killed that that level of evil and icy wickedness
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:59.220]  actually makes makes my heart flutter it but my heart just fluttered I mean

[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.260]  photo is actually from Planned Parenthood it's a promotion they did
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:46:03.340]  Gloria stynum I had an abortion it's all part of flaunting it in your face
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:09.340]  images here it is guys just punch up my screen here I've got it they'll just
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:14.180]  punch up my screen I'll show people there you go I had an abortion with an
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:19.140]  Illuminati sign of sacrifice she says I opened up my third eye when I had him
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:25.620]  put a blender in me now let's go ahead I was saying kill people up to age three
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:30.660]  now let's go ahead and go to killing the ugly black babies to quote the
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:34.500]  abortionist this is standard standard procedure here it is here's another
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:40.140]  crazy story abortionist sees aborting ugly black babies as a service to the
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:45.940]  taxpayers now we got this video of a pro-life Christian group confronting an
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:51.700]  abortion doctor the doctor says his abortion save taxpayers money prevent
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:57.340]  shootings like the one in Colorado and rid the world of ugly black babies so
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:27.300]  let's go to the clip so let you have
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.220]  it basically they confront the abortionist and he says why you want all
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.980]  these ugly black babies taxpayers just gonna have to pay for them anyway and
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.580]  then of course they all go on to commit mass shooting black one in Colorado makes
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:43.580]  perfect sense right well it goes right to the heart of what we've discussed many
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:47.660]  times which is what abortion is all about at its foundational level which is
[01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:53.700]  modern-day eugenics and racism of course you can trace it back to Marie Stokes
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:59.460]  and even before that Marie Stokes was this big women's rights activist who is
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:04.320]  celebrated in Britain they put a face on the stamps and everything and she was
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.820]  the person who helped open the first abortion clinics in Britain back in the
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:15.260]  1920s and by the 1930s she kept herself busy by writing love letters to
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:22.660]  adults Hitler while advocating compulsory sterilization of non-whites and
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:28.900]  other people with quote bad character this is the woman that's the big denizen
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:34.900]  of the women's rights movement in Britain and now her charity Marie Stokes
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:39.980]  International advertises in women's magazines through these public relations
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:45.500]  articles encouraging women under 30 years old to be sterilized so they can't
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:49.900]  have kids and all the women read this and it's all very trendy now to get
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:56.980]  sterilized before the age of 30 and basically she was busy writing love
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:01.860]  letters to Hitler and saying how great is population control policies were she
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:06.700]  was setting up all these abortion clinics in poor areas of Britain and who
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:11.420]  did she leave her estate to when she died well the eugenics society better
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:16.780]  known today as the Galton Institute which according to its own website
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:21.460]  promotes funding quote for the practical delivery of family planning
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:25.900]  facilities especially in developing countries so in other words the same
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:31.020]  organization that once advocated sterilizing black people to achieve
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:36.460]  racial purity in the same vein as the Nazis as Marie Stoke wrote her love
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:42.700]  love letters to adult Hitler is now bankrolling the abortion of black babies
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:47.820]  in the third world and of course you can trace the same trajectory back to where
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:52.260]  Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood of course there in the United States they
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:56.220]  also set up all the abortion clinics in the poor areas in the areas where black
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:50:02.260]  people live and Sanger was on record as a racist to advocate the sterilization
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:06.740]  of black people and of course she was also part of the Galton Institute
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:13.020]  formerly the eugenics society so no surprise that modern-day abortionists now
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:19.460]  decide the necessity to get rid of quote ugly black babies as part of their
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:23.860]  job all right because that's the bottom line about the rest of Paul Watson's
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.580]  report is up at info wars.com we've also got recordings of Planned Parenthood
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:32.340]  advertising to donors that yeah we'll guarantee all your money goes to kill
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:36.140]  black babies because that's what it was and again then you got to put up with
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:40.500]  all the black folks conditioned that white people are all evil and 95% of
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:44.540]  them voting for Obama and I'm not saying vote for Mitt Romney but Obama has
[01:50:44.540 --> 01:50:48.260]  massively increased the money to kill as many black people as possible not just
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.620]  here but in Africa so here's the deal I don't have any guilt myself I hadn't
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:57.420]  done jack squat do you stop obsessing over fake racial issues of inequality
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:04.660]  while you're murdering your own people. Alex Jones here with a great way to beat
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:08.340]  the blackouts get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical

[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:02.980]  call first-time caller we were blessed to meet you out here at the Bilderbergs
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:11.100]  and we're out here at that time with you and and Aaron and I had a question I
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:17.660]  was wondering is do you see any relationship between the chem trails and
[01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:24.420]  the drought the severe weather going on you know I've predicted probably 500
[01:56:24.420 --> 01:56:27.460]  times on air in the last decade because the government said they do it I didn't
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:30.740]  really predict it owning the weather weaponizing the weather that they are
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:34.460]  engaging in weaponized weather operations to bankrupt the country they've
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:38.060]  got more than half the country an emergency and they say pay all gore money
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:43.340]  for carbon taxes and the bad weather will go away and polar bears will learn
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:47.900]  how to swim again and so will penguins so yeah no there's no doubt they're
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:50.860]  doing weather modification everywhere they admit they are they just say it's
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:58.220]  classified Bill Gates is dumping sulfur dioxide all over the US publicly and he
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:01.620]  gets taxpayer money to do it he gets paid to dump it on you and it's in the
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:09.740]  news and yeah no they're jacking with everything yeah yeah I noticed at the
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:14.940]  airport here nearby I've seen I one day actually saw this playing go by it might
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:21.340]  have been that probably was outfitted for chemicals but it had the evergreen on
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:25.660]  it I know that's supposed to be the company is it one of the main companies
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:32.700]  dealing with the that has the contract for that the chemistry over the you know
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:37.340]  putting that stuff out and yeah I've seen those reports and I know they're a
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:43.660]  shadowy grove but most the spring is around storms to manipulate them when
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:47.200]  it's done specifically but they have patents where the nuclei are added to
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.860]  jet fuel through the three big distributors so the companies don't
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:55.340]  even know then they work with airline manufacturers to even slightly change the
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:58:00.940]  turbine settings to have to disperse it better so it's in the jet fuel sir
[01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:07.660]  so the planes the crews don't even realize that no they don't even know
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:11.500]  there's like there's over 50 patents on it it's sir it's so diabolical it'll

[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:12.660]  the air welcome hey how's it going out there it's going all right my friend well
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:15.700]  let me tell you something brother I'm sorry I'm so sick and tired of these
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:19.660]  criminal pieces of trash thinking they run our lives didn't this used to be a
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:23.300]  sovereign nation at one time sir yeah but we're run by eugenicist who promised
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:25.980]  to get control of food water and poisonous and most people are brain
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:29.340]  damaged now and they're they're taking over they're giving illegal aliens
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:33.340]  their social security numbers and tax IDs letting them run up bills in our name
[02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:39.380]  and then taking citizens homes and the IRS knows it it just makes me sick to
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:43.300]  no end I'm a young man I'm 26 and I say we tell as many people about this stuff
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:46.300]  as possible there's overwhelming evidence that these criminals are in our
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:49.060]  face doing exactly what you're saying there are no they admitted I mean I was
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:52.180]  told this months ago by whistleblowers and was getting the evidence together and
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:55.420]  now it's in the associated press and they're like oh yeah we give the
[02:01:55.420 --> 02:01:59.180]  illegals cards and let them make billions of dollars and you know you know
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:03.060]  each house gets you know hundreds of millions in some cases and I was reading
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:06.580]  this it was worse than whistleblowers telling but then it's the part about when
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:11.540]  they use a citizen's ID number sometimes the IRS knows the citizens innocent
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:16.220]  but we're seen as the target schmuck shucker chomp and we know the police
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:20.860]  and courts are geared to savage citizens and so then they use that to frame up
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:25.340]  the citizen and take everything they got and now the IRS is having a paying of
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:33.540]  conscience I mean that is evil man I mean that is just who thinks of stuff
[02:02:33.540 --> 02:02:38.260]  this diabolical but let me tell you a personal experience I had happened to
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:42.580]  me and carry on pieces up here in Pennsylvania and I had a stop last
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:45.780]  month of ten minutes of the Nazi police telling me that I need to give him ID
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.940]  well I caught it on YouTube and I got a link to it if you don't mind me saying
[02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:52.180]  it yeah no it's well everybody wearing their guns in public is so beautiful
[02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:55.940]  cuz five years ago they beat you up then three years ago they'd arrest you now
[02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:00.140]  they just want your ID they're backing off we were at Bilderberg and protesters
[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:05.980]  showed up with guns and let me tell you everybody the police got real polite when
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:09.500]  that happened I talked to the people they weren't provocateurs and and the
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:14.140]  media that was there didn't know what to say hey folks we run this country just
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:17.780]  cuz a bunch of child molesting bankers took over doesn't mean we're not taking

[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:33.220]  stopped me five times before and at one point I kid you not I have it on video
[02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:36.540]  I have a cop on my left look at me and say I said well shouldn't you be following
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:39.980]  the Constitution with a straight face he says to me when the president follows
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:42.940]  the Constitution I will and then him and the other officer have a laugh about
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:47.980]  it oh no no that's what happens with corruption well everybody else is

[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:14.940]  there's a war on for your mind my friends it's very simple a technocratic
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:19.140]  ruling class has written countless books and textbooks going back a hundred and
[02:08:19.140 --> 02:08:24.780]  sixty years ago roughly 1850s or so in England the US and Germany France as
[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:28.500]  well but mainly those countries bragging that they would build a
[02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:32.820]  technocratic technological control system take control of human development
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:38.260]  create a sub void servant class they invent that they envisioned robots they
[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:42.940]  envisioned atomic weapons by 1900 they really laid out the whole plan they
[02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:48.180]  invented computers at IBM to just track genetics they envisioned DNA and
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:52.180]  undoubtedly had secrets the ancients already had that they've been passing
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:57.140]  forward through secret societies they're playing God and they see us as a
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:02.580]  disease and they hire armies of just really nasty people that like to abuse
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:07.700]  folks for petty power trips and other reasons and we're in a lot of trouble as
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:10.860]  the society coming up here in six or seven minutes we're going to get a
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:14.700]  guest on about the shootings we've been seeing and it's just a prelude towards
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:19.980]  bigger staged events ahead of Obama signing an executive order of restrict
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:25.420]  guns he did say last week we can pull it up in the hill newspaper that he may
[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:28.660]  implement everything in the cyber security act tracking the web getting
[02:09:28.660 --> 02:09:34.820]  rid of due process internet taxes tracking you know internet IDs internet
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:40.900]  blacklist and banning semi-autos and online ammo cells and things he said he
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:45.820]  may do executive order you saw that in the news and undoubtedly I've looked at
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.700]  these they lean heavily towards false flag we have a government that's done
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:55.500]  these before don't forget fast and furious it has all the classic MO we
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:58.060]  have to look at that that's coming up at a moment but right now let's go to
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:04.260]  Bryson Missouri bright shirt on the air welcome thanks Alex for taking my call
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:09.100]  I appreciate it thank you yeah and I got some good news to share I've been
[02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:12.940]  talking to a lot of different Christian groups and Christian people out there
[02:10:12.940 --> 02:10:16.820]  about what's going on and granted most of those people look at me like deer in
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:21.940]  the headlights but some people kind of actually know some bits and pieces but
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:25.140]  aren't really connecting the dots and stuff like that so I've been just
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:29.460]  passing out this movie and actually showed it in our own Sunday school class
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:34.900]  and and that's really receiving well reviews what movie is that again yeah
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:40.340]  panacea the cure for humankind they haven't seen it I'll have to send me a
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:46.180]  copy well I actually contacted Rob a few times and he says you can see what he
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:50.580]  could do and even like even get pastor Mack the guy who has been interviewed on
[02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:54.340]  there I mean he's like no other pastor out there I mean there's very few pastors
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:59.020]  let's just say that that are really in tune with the truth and stuff so but
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:02.860]  yeah I mean and I'm getting like really well well we're just your reviews and
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:07.660]  stuff I'm sorry I'm a little nervous here but one thing that I've done no I
[02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:11.420]  have noticed is that there's a lot of people out there who aren't Christian
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:15.740]  who are more in tune with what the devil's lies than the Christians are so
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:19.020]  it's like I think that we really need to get up there and well yeah that's because
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:23.780]  most Christians are going to zombie churches I appreciate your call most
[02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:27.320]  these churches are government run through the 501 C3 and through their
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:30.900]  denominations taken over by the National Council and then World Council of
[02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:35.540]  churches I mean they brag about it you mean you're taught to be a slave you're
[02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:38.420]  taught to worship tyranny you're taught to go to sleep and wait for the rapture
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:41.700]  and that's the end of it while the whole world goes to hell in a handbasket
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:47.420]  because the preachers tell us 1987's the rapture in 1990 and 95 and 97 and 2000
[02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:52.900]  and 2010 and 2011 and 2012 and the New Ages it's the end of the world in
[02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:58.060]  December and it's never the end of the world it's the end of freedom then if
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:03.580]  everything decent everybody's just waiting for it all to end you know I'm
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:09.860]  just going to cover what's happening and what the globalists are doing to us more
[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:12.740]  than a hundred thousand preachers have been hired part of clergy response team
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:16.940]  they love it their little secret agents spy on their flock creeping around I
[02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:23.220]  mean these were just despicable un-American trash cowardly filth who
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:26.660]  just want to get money from the globalist the bankers occupation force
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:33.620]  their collaborators to use a fictional account it's like which is based on real
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:36.220]  accounts of things that happen it's like red dawn with a mayor and the
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:40.540]  preacher rat and everybody out this is they'll stand there while we're lined up
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:49.660]  and shot and love it they bow to evil of the devil's right hand these churches
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:54.020]  of the devil's right hand the devil's right hand the devil's right hand
[02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:58.260]  mama said the preachers were the devil's right hand these modern preachers
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:04.620]  let's go to Dave and Arizona you're on the air welcome yes Alex worldwide
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:10.020]  transmission how do you hear I'm good sir thank you I just wanted to know if
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:16.700]  you heard Obama's latest comments it sounded like he was talking to children
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:22.100]  and he was saying now we're a family and we have his violence we have to do
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:26.660]  something about this and he had a lot of pauses and he said we're gonna have to
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:33.700]  make some tough decisions as a family who said that the lines there who said
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:38.220]  that Obama I just heard it when I was getting off work today at 6 a.m. well
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:45.100]  guys pull up Obama's statements on guns it was on guns correct yes well you know
[02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:48.220]  what he didn't he didn't say it was on guns he just said that we're a family
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:51.740]  we're gonna have to do something about this violence and we're gonna have to
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:54.900]  make some tough decisions yeah I mean it doesn't matter if you if there's been a
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:14:00.740]  0.1 increase in mass shootings above five people since 1992 just department
[02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:04.820]  so numbers it doesn't matter if it's way down the list shootings period it
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:07.300]  doesn't matter if cities where they've taken all the guns like New York and
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:12.500]  Chicago or cesspits of crime and victim disarmament and abuse it doesn't
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:17.260]  matter yeah no he's getting ready for the executive order he said I may see
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:21.500]  said last week I may sign executive order banning all semi-autos and then
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:26.060]  they they dream of making examples of people I just saw the footage that guy
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:30.060]  called in about himself in Pennsylvania with an open carry and the cops come up
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:32.860]  with their guns and the guy says you know it's legal for me to have a gun
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:35.740]  they're like we don't care we don't follow the Constitution anymore and they
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:39.180]  watch it during the break they say we don't follow the Constitution anymore
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:43.700]  because the president doesn't and that's what it is and they want the guns so the
[02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:48.220]  foreign banks can bring this country down and I mean it's just a lawless murder
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.580]  crew what about the thousands that died mr. criminal president because you
[02:14:52.580 --> 02:14:56.020]  ship guns in the Mexico to blame our second amendment you stinking piece of
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:03.060]  trash go ahead so what else did you hear Obama say hell I'll pull it up right
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:08.580]  now go ahead well that's that's all I heard you say about that but then you
[02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:13.660]  were also talking about race and I this almost sounds racist for me to say this
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:19.060]  but I think I should tell you about this story when I was in 1989 I bought a
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:24.100]  house I'm very white I'm a very white person but I bought a house in the city
[02:15:24.100 --> 02:15:29.700]  I was the only white person in the house and I was welcomed into that
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:35.820]  neighborhood so warmly and I lived there for 13 years and there was there was
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:41.780]  never any friction that I noticed I treated I treated them with respect they
[02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:45.780]  treated with me with respect and I just think it's so racist but I have to bring
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:49.620]  this up but that's the way you do it you just get along with other human beings
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:54.700]  and that's multiculturalism is about getting everybody so scared of each
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:16:01.100]  other that no one communicates with each other that's what this listen all the
[02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:06.380]  modern liberals went to schools they're all racist including the black ones they
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:10.660]  love it I mean I've seen black people talk about about that listen they're
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:15.340]  they're pimps they want to run broke down people okay that's the bottom line
[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:20.740]  here and they know exactly what they're doing their experts at it and I can't
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:24.340]  tell you how many people when I years ago had time to do it I would go protest
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:31.460]  abortion clinics yes folks I've done that and people come up and say you don't
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:36.380]  want those black babies that's a that's a standard deal I'd say actually
[02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:39.420]  there's statistics showing that there are Christian organizations that are
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:43.780]  trying to adopt even more black babies that are even being aborted and there's
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:47.980]  more way more adoptions each year than our people giving them up for adoption
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:56.220]  and by the way my family adopted a unwanted Korean child from Korea okay I
[02:16:56.220 --> 02:17:01.420]  mean there's such a premium on snatching up all the white kids for CPS to be
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.460]  sold off to rich white people and others but also globalists like to kill them
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:09.540]  that goes on a lot that you know it wasn't a big issue but it's like well
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:12.100]  what type of child you know should we try to get because my mom couldn't have
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:16.140]  children after me well well you know I remember going talking to
[02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:19.500]  these people that were adopting Korean children the point is is that there's a
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:24.060]  huge lack of children to be adopted people people who have children it
[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:27.100]  can't have anymore know how great and loving and good children are they want
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:30.900]  me we may adopt someday if we don't have more children we've got three and I'll
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:34.260]  just be quite frank about it I mean I might adopt five children one reason I
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:37.020]  do want to actually make some money and keep some money I want to take care of
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:42.060]  children I want to protect them and build them up and see them strong and
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:46.500]  there's all these people lined up that want to adopt children and they got
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:50.900]  black liberal groups that fight to keep whites from adopting black children
[02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:53.820]  they'd rather have them chopped up and thrown in a trash can or used for
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:58.260]  medical experiments and that's the liberal parasite black leaders because
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:01.100]  they're not liberals I mean Margaret Sanger says she said we're gonna hire
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:04.820]  blacks we're gonna call ourselves liberal we're gonna kill these people and
[02:18:04.820 --> 02:18:09.660]  you know what they kill them they kill them good and you know you try to talk
[02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:15.900]  to the average you know wrapped out new world ordered out black person and and
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:19.900]  you know say 20 year old male they'll just laugh at you I've tried they're
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:24.020]  like shut up you white idiot you don't want to sit there and tell me oh yeah
[02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:27.300]  right they don't want to hear about it they just want to feel like they're
[02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:32.340]  winners just like the yuppies want to feel like Romney's gonna save them it's
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.660]  just it's fantasy world I appreciate your call we're to come back with our guests

[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:57.580]  yeah I voted for Obama they say cuz you know why you know we're moving up in

[02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:26.780]  All right a few weeks ago we had him sit in as a guest host did a great job I wanted
[02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:31.900]  to get him on for a little bit of this shower. Colin Vanden Neuenhoff's the writer
[02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:36.660]  one of the researchers on the amazing film that we sell. In fact here it is right
[02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:42.260]  here a noble lie Oklahoma City 95 and we warn of new false flags by this
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:45.380]  administration because the Justice Department a lot of the folks in the
[02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:49.860]  Justice Department at that time at 95 are the ones that were all over and
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:55.300]  heavily involved in Oklahoma City. We have this from survivors police officers
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:59.220]  the inventor of the neutron bomb the former head of Air Force weapons
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:04.580]  development the late Hoppy Heidelberg. We have family members of the police
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:08.140]  officer cop of the year it was murdered for seeing the feds and take carry out
[02:25:08.140 --> 02:25:12.380]  the attack and he would shut up it's an award-winning film available at info
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:19.060]  warshop.com a noble lie 1995 but the reason I've got him popping in is you
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:24.100]  know he's a former Marine himself and a researcher and we have been saying I
[02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:28.020]  saw I'm in the film it's why I promoted it so much is I said they're gonna stage
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:32.100]  terror attacks mass shootings bombings and I believe this is a lead-up and now
[02:25:32.100 --> 02:25:36.100]  Obama's talking about executive orders to go after our guns. Colin Vanden Neuenhoff's
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:39.860]  the native Oklahoma formerly served the US Marine as a rifle squad leader his
[02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:44.740]  broadcasting career is in 2007 is radio free Oklahoma he's now syndicated in
[02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:50.260]  different areas of the United States and he joins us here today. Holland first
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:53.980]  off great job doing the show one day last week I guess it was last Monday
[02:25:53.980 --> 02:25:58.620]  wasn't it and it's a great to have you here with us. I haven't gotten your take
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:04.540]  on these latest shootings but boy it sure fits the mold of all the past
[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:08.300]  operations we got the president of the Sikhs saying guys casing and all these
[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:11.620]  witnesses saying four people shooting you got the southern property law center
[02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:15.020]  all over it we know most these white supremacist groups are just filled with
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:18.860]  feds did they shoot one of their own patsies did a cop show up and shoot one
[02:26:18.860 --> 02:26:23.060]  of the operatives all I know is is that this is the season for them to pull this
[02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:29.020]  off with five bills introduced to ban all semi-autos in this country. Well
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:33.900]  there is no doubt that an agenda is at play gun control was dead before these
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:37.300]  mass shootings because of fast and furious which is no longer in the
[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:41.420]  headlines which killed up to 2,000 people which is by definition a false
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:45.580]  flag attack and flicking a wound upon yourself or another person and blaming
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:50.340]  it on someone else to fulfill a political agenda. So we see what is
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:53.420]  happening we can look in the past we can look at the Oklahoma City bombing of
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:57.460]  course in the Noble Iowa examine that some of those same people are back in
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:02.100]  power including Eric Holder who was assistant attorney general of the
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:06.780]  United States in in the cover-up of the Oklahoma City bombing he's now attorney
[02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:11.500]  general of the United States he directly executed fast and furious and is now
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:16.340]  overseeing these new this new wave of gun crimes that just appeared out of
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:20.060]  nowhere these mass shootings and the funny thing is when you look at these
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:23.580]  mass shootings when you look at other mass shootings that happen across the
[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:29.100]  nation the there's not this huge level of evidence of government involvement
[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:33.500]  these past three shootings the Sikh shooting in Oak Creek Wisconsin the
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:37.820]  Aurora shooting and the Tucson shooting have black ops fingerprints all over
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:41.420]  them when you look at other mass shootings in history you don't see that
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:45.020]  and we see the agenda they're pushing which is gun control which was dead
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:49.780]  before these attacks and we can look in the past how have they got gun control
[02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:54.180]  executed in other first-world countries in Britain you have the Dunblane
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:57.940]  massacre at the primary school where someone who was connected to a
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:03.140]  politically protected pedophile ring walked into a primary school and shot
[02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:08.820]  16 grade schoolers and their teachers killed them and of course the firearms
[02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:11.900]  amendment act in Britain after that totally banned firearms you had the
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:16.660]  Port Arthur massacre in Australia which had black ops fingerprints and the
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:19.740]  premier even said we need a mass shooting to get their guns and then it
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:23.260]  happened and then we have Operation Gladio where NATO and the Pentagon has
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:26.660]  been caught doing hundreds of these in Europe including theater shootings I
[02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:31.300]  mean this is their specialty to take liberties exactly at some point they
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:36.060]  have to take the guns out of our hands the the agenda can only advance so far
[02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:41.100]  while we have the power to defend ourselves and there is a very entrenched
[02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:44.980]  gun culture in this country very entrenched in contrast perhaps to
[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:47.940]  Britain Australia and other countries that have outright banned guns a very
[02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:52.420]  strong in fact after the Aurora shooting I believe Reuters showed that gun views
[02:28:52.420 --> 02:28:57.860]  on gun ownership had changed not at all well actually some bullshit people got
[02:28:57.860 --> 02:29:02.220]  more pro gun and gun sales doubled on top of even the previous record yes yeah
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:07.100]  all we've got left in American culture is is basically the gun culture it cuts
[02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:11.260]  across the lines people are all buying guns we're winning they're losing they're
[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:16.140]  panicking exactly so maybe this formula isn't exactly working because the
[02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:19.700]  response I see in my fellow countrymen in response to these attacks as well I
[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:23.420]  need a gun well I do live in Oklahoma of course which has the highest rate of
[02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:28.020]  governorship in the country but I don't think I don't think it's quite working so
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:31.740]  I wonder if they're going to have to change up the formula a little to try to
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:36.460]  affect change absolutely let's come back and break down some of the anomalies
[02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:41.300]  and get into some of the other news with our guest Holland Vanden Neuenhoff the

[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:35.380]  who were only held back in their evil by what they can get away with now remember
[02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:38.860]  it's now in the news like I told you last week we had whistleblowers here in
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:43.260]  Austin you notice it broke nationwide before I could collate it all because
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:50.820]  there's so much that the IRS in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:57.140]  per home is in the Associated Press it's an accounting today that in Austin
[02:33:57.140 --> 02:34:04.060]  Texas in 154 mailing addresses that were used a thousand or more times 10
[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:09.820]  individual addresses were used for 53,994 tax returns resulting in the
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:19.700]  processing of 86.4 million 86.4 million dollars in 10 individual
[02:34:19.700 --> 02:34:24.300]  addresses and that's exactly but but but what you're not seeing in the news
[02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:28.180]  because we haven't gotten our report out yet because our whistleblowers are so
[02:34:28.180 --> 02:34:31.420]  scared and it's like this is other whistleblowers the government I guess
[02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:36.180]  heard us talk about it or it's come to a head look the word is the mutiny is so
[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:40.380]  bad here at the biggest IRS tax center in the country for five states but also
[02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:44.860]  for other states but but everything for five states for the Occupational
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:47.900]  Federal Reserve and its collaborators that's where it is that they bragged
[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:51.060]  that conquer this that's not me just saying we've been occupied I mean they
[02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:56.620]  say that literally that they've been told retroactively even though the law
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:01.500]  doesn't say it just start saying that that retirees can't use their own pension
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:05.700]  money and retroactively demand after somebody's been retired usually from
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:09.300]  about a decade millions of dollars on hundreds of thousands they've pulled out
[02:35:09.300 --> 02:35:13.860]  of retirement with penalties and interest they're they say over 70% of what
[02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:19.980]  they're taking is retirees homes and the worst thing that's crippling them is
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:24.820]  there's all this fraud with the tax hiding numbers they're ordered to give
[02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:28.980]  illegals selectively enforced so they can do this as an incentive to come or
[02:35:28.980 --> 02:35:32.420]  just like the free I mean I went my finger basically chopped off once and
[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:34.900]  couldn't get medical care but the illegals were just going right in in front
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.620]  of me I had an insurance card everything they're like you're scum get back
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:43.820]  it's all mandated to bring people in here to break down the country and so
[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:47.900]  there's scam on scam and it's all being reported on by AP world that daily but
[02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:50.860]  it's a lot deeper so I'm going to get the full report out in the next few days
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:54.500]  and I'm trying to twist their arms into coming in here so we can black their
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:58.820]  faces out and you know tell the story and the reason I'm getting into this is
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:03.740]  the crime is so huge that it goes into what we learned a couple years ago it
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:08.660]  was even an AP Bloomberg that in 99 the top insurance company sat down with the
[02:36:08.660 --> 02:36:13.980]  Department of Defense and said we'd like to keep the trillion plus dollars of
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:17.060]  death benefits when you're in the military they ask you do you want part of
[02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:20.900]  your check taken out to be put in extra life insurance policy well all this
[02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:24.340]  money piled up since World War two right through current wars they just don't
[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:27.900]  give you that money and they allow them to send something to your widow or
[02:36:27.900 --> 02:36:31.860]  widower saying shine here you'll get the money and the fine print is they take
[02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:36.740]  your money I mean folks these are criminals of the most hardcore type and
[02:36:36.740 --> 02:36:42.420]  so the IRS is is freaking out it's so criminal that they know that when that
[02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:46.980]  the illegals use your social security number it's not just the tax ID but that
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:52.020]  with another tax ID that doesn't match they're able to set stuff up they get
[02:36:52.020 --> 02:36:56.540]  tax returns your accounts get seized you get in trouble and they're actually
[02:36:56.540 --> 02:37:02.820]  taking people's money of people they know are innocent and that was what was
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:05.500]  finally too much it's one thing to steal an old lady's house they kind of
[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:10.940]  like that some of them but it's another thing to know that it isn't even a
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:15.900]  retroactive tax deal they're just they give out the numbers people run scams
[02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:21.380]  under your name then they take your property this criminal government wants
[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:27.100]  to destroy this country that's not just talk that's happening going back to the
[02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:31.500]  maker one of the writers and producers of the incredible film a noble lie
[02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:35.660]  Holland Vander Neuenhoff it's available at info warshop.com as I mentioned I
[02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:39.780]  bring this up in relation to mass shootings if you've got Operation Gladio
[02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:45.860]  hundreds of mass shootings and bombings over Europe 60 70s 80s by NATO posing as
[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:49.980]  political enemies they want to blame patsy's framed fast and furious gulf of
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:55.060]  Tonkin operation Ajax operation Northwoods countless other events and
[02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:58.840]  then and that these guys all have military psychiatrists or an army
[02:37:58.840 --> 02:38:02.700]  psyops let's talk about the last two shootings what's happening here but
[02:38:02.700 --> 02:38:08.820]  first what do you make of the fact that that that that that that the system is
[02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:15.140]  so incredibly off the chart evil and what will they do next well it's chilling
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:19.340]  they are cold-blooded that cannot be denied I mean I have been you know and
[02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:22.980]  all those have been of course you have been to also hip deep in studying in
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:28.180]  these deep-state events for for over a decade or more and when it happens again
[02:38:28.180 --> 02:38:31.940]  and again and again it's still shocking that they're willing to stoop to such
[02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:36.300]  level to advance a political agenda but when it cannot be denied it cannot be
[02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:39.020]  denied at all when you see these shootings with with links to military
[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:42.900]  intelligence psychological warfare operations Pentagon shrinks to DARPA
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:46.900]  super soldier programs I mean there's not a whole lot of people in this country
[02:38:46.900 --> 02:38:50.220]  that are involved in these types of programs and they're all conducting
[02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:54.820]  mass shootings at a time when it's very politically convenient for them to be
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:59.940]  doing so and you have the the gag orders on the court documents in fact the
[02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:04.420]  Jared Lee Laughman case the Tucson shooting apparently he pled guilty so
[02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:08.780]  there's gonna be no examination of that evidence people on the scene saw other
[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:13.900]  shooters there were more bullets fired than the magazine in his gun held and
[02:39:13.900 --> 02:39:16.540]  there were a lot there were a lot of things about the Jared Lee Laughman case
[02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:20.140]  that are are not going to be examined because there's not going to be a trial
[02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:24.500]  we can fully expect the same with the Batman massacre and with this shooting
[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:30.020]  at the Sikh shooting the perpetrator apparently as last word killed himself so
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:34.380]  of course there's not going to be a trial so you see just the media manipulating
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:38.460]  the story no critical examination no trial I mean not that the trial is
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:42.140]  going to achieve justice but at least the evidence will be put forth through the
[02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:47.740]  the gauntlet of some kind of examination and it can be examined as he was true
[02:39:47.740 --> 02:39:52.500]  or not we're not gonna get that so we can only assume that these events are
[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:58.020]  going to continue and get worse until they achieve their goal of removing guns
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:01.860]  from the hands of Americans they've already stepped in into a pool of blood
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:05.180]  with this they've already killed dozens of people trying to do this for this one
[02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:10.420]  action they're not going to stop they may make it increase and that's something
[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:14.140]  I've said out time and time again one of the the double-edged sword of this info
[02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:17.940]  measure information where that we are winning is that as more people become
[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:22.940]  awakened refused to cooperate with these horrific agendas the elite controllers
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:26.860]  or whoever they are whatever you want to call them they get desperate well they
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:30.500]  see it as stimuli I mean they write about false flag and army manuals it's
[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:34.380]  public they have to give us the fear stimuli they see this is cold-blooded
[02:40:34.380 --> 02:40:39.820]  science and we're lab rats and you just have a drug dot pat see you roll in who
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:43.820]  can't even talk and then a year later they have them plead guilty it's the
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:50.020]  same story over and over and over again but now Obama was saying he may sign an
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:56.300]  executive order banning our semi-autos and it's getting almost no attention well
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:41:00.220]  there's a precedent for that I believe George Bush senior back in 1990 banned
[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:05.180]  assault weapons in the state of California because of a perceived wave of
[02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:09.780]  increased assault weapon ban whatever you want to call an assault weapon is what
[02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:13.740]  is a little known about that is that there was a massive non-compliance in
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:16.900]  the state of California with turning in assault weapons so they just kind of
[02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:19.220]  dropped the issue they don't want attention being brought on the fact
[02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:23.380]  that people were not obeying the law this unconstitutional gun ban they
[02:41:23.380 --> 02:41:25.860]  weren't obeying it so they just kind of dropped it they didn't want to start a
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:29.940]  fight at that stage in the game but maybe they're ready to start a fight now I
[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:33.300]  hope not because I don't want it to come to that but I am not giving up my guns
[02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:38.220]  and a good portion of the entrance gun culture in this country will not give up
[02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:42.820]  their guns perhaps that's why we see the military militarization of the police
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:47.980]  stepping up as such an increased rate and all I can say to the cops is if they
[02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:51.940]  try to launch this civil war if the social engineers do they're gonna pick
[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:57.580]  people out who they think are kooky to sell the ideas that those that have guns
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:01.460]  are bad like the dividends they already tried this but people instinctively get
[02:42:01.460 --> 02:42:05.340]  that and they'll pick out some people some more ruby ridges burn out some
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:09.500]  houses kill some people to try to scare us I still don't get globalist
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:15.380]  psychology because they think we're like them and I just wouldn't want to be the
[02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:18.660]  police and military trying to carry this out after they conduct some
[02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:22.740]  massacres because it is going to become very dangerous to be one of them
[02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:28.900]  exactly I mean this military is having a pretty hard time overseas fighting
[02:42:28.900 --> 02:42:32.700]  people in the desert with in guerrilla warfare which is actually the worst place
[02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:35.940]  in the world to conduct guerrilla warfare bring it to this country where
[02:42:35.940 --> 02:42:40.620]  you have millions and millions of trained gun owners most of the military
[02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:44.220]  veterans themselves in this train unwilling to give up their freedoms
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:49.980]  with a solid tradition of freedom and and their individual rights something
[02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:52.940]  really to fight for there's not being paid to pull up a suicide bombing in
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:57.180]  this country will be fighting for our rights and the future rights of our
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:43:01.980]  children I truly feel sorry for any police or military force that attempts
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:06.460]  to take away our guns by force and the fact is a lot of the military is not
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:09.500]  going to comply they're gonna have a real hard time on their hands perhaps
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:14.700]  that's the role that the UN will play in this gun confiscation I don't know we
[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:17.900]  shall see but once again I feel sorry for him I was in the Marines I was in the
[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:24.100]  infantry I know how it works and I know that people say well the military so
[02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:26.900]  powerful you can't fight them yeah I don't want to fight our military I've
[02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:33.140]  been in the military but they asymmetric warfare dictates that we have the
[02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:36.620]  advantage this is a new paradigm of warfare that the military is
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:40.780]  experiencing in Afghanistan and Iraq where they are having a hard time look
[02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:43.980]  you don't even need guns if you're angry and somebody's done something wrong to
[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:47.420]  your family if you got a hammer and you've got the element of surprise you
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:50.340]  can get all the weapons you want if you're willing to kill nothing can stop
[02:43:50.340 --> 02:43:53.340]  you if you're willing to sell your life for theirs and I'm telling you that's
[02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:58.740]  going to get triggered in this country exactly and I wonder how they're going
[02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:01.380]  to overcome that have they taken that into the calculations because I'm
[02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:05.140]  looking at the scoreboard I'm saying you have no chance you have no chance if
[02:44:05.140 --> 02:44:08.460]  took it I'll tell you what they're gonna do they're just getting this ready right
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:12.100]  now they'll probably release a bio weapon they'll probably kill a hundred
[02:44:12.100 --> 02:44:14.980]  million people that they go with that playbook and then everybody'll just be
[02:44:14.980 --> 02:44:18.900]  so shut down they'll roll in later saying it's a disaster if you want food if
[02:44:18.900 --> 02:44:23.100]  you want aid give us your guns that's probably the move or they stir up you
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:27.260]  know sectarian hatred in this country when we fight each other for it oh yeah
[02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:32.620]  exactly so maybe we expend all our energy and our ammunition on each other
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:37.740]  well that's just like Mossad and British Intel and US all got caught dressed up
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:44.020]  like Sunnis attacking Shiites to get them killing each other in 2003 4567
[02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:48.620]  because they needed to have a simulant of combat to say there was terrorism they
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:52.580]  would get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other exactly that was the the
[02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:56.900]  great surge that they claimed won the Iraq war was actually paying off
[02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:02.300]  different militias in Baghdad and other contested provinces to wipe out their
[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:05.260]  opponents just paying them to wipe them out there's a bloodbath there was a
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:10.300]  massacre so maybe that's the model and perhaps the model they will choose here
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:14.180]  we just have to remember that if they do try to do it we must remember who our
[02:45:14.180 --> 02:45:20.260]  true enemy is and not be sucked into this trap which I which now that there
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:23.780]  you go let's say the American people are like the Shiites and the cops are like
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:27.500]  the Sunnis because that's a smaller group I mean that's a bigger group so
[02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:30.860]  it'd be the the cops are more like the Shiites the public would be like the
[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:34.940]  Sunnis they plan on playing us off against each other that's divide and
[02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:38.540]  conquer that's the program right there and then you have the central authority
[02:45:38.540 --> 02:45:42.700]  with their guns the government coming in to restore peace and taking away all our
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:47.060]  firearms maybe that's the model they'll follow but that's that doesn't mean it's
[02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:50.180]  gonna happen with that the fact that you and I are talking about this Alex at
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:52.820]  the world is talking about this information war that we are winning that
[02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:57.200]  you're leading we are waking up the fact that these gun control these gun
[02:45:57.200 --> 02:46:01.380]  massacres have not worked to change public opinion means that we are winning
[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:05.900]  the information war I think we are catching up and maybe surpassing them
[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:09.980]  in the way to process information and catching on to their game their methods
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:14.780]  may be coming obsolete and hopefully hopefully so I think that's an astute
[02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:19.100]  point and I don't think Holland you're just putting a good face on that the
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:24.140]  organic brain hundreds of millions of us really awake our people watching
[02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:27.740]  everywhere every time they stage an event now our people are catching them
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:30.980]  whether it's the underwear bomber you name it that's shaking them up they
[02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:34.700]  admit that whistleblowers is what they're mainly using the NSA to watch for
[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:39.860]  now but people are like look I can't take old ladies houses for no reason you
[02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:43.260]  know it's not like it's some rich guy that didn't even pay or whatever so
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:48.460]  they're rebelling I mean it's reaching a point of the corruption cresting but
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:55.100]  listen the globalists are hubris arrogant a bravado hoods but whatever you
[02:46:55.100 --> 02:46:59.260]  want to call it fueled they're they're crazy I mean they may go around it by
[02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:02.020]  yes man they're surrounded by yes man to tell them what they want to hear so
[02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:07.060]  they're suffering from an information deficit also I mean I obviously in our
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:11.860]  work on the Oklahoma City bombing with a noble lie that happened in 1995 that was
[02:47:11.860 --> 02:47:15.340]  in the in the very infancy of the internet most people didn't have
[02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:18.620]  internet access in their home so that's imminent dissemination of information
[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:23.020]  was not nearly as rapid as it is today with these events now like I've said
[02:47:23.020 --> 02:47:26.820]  before the shell casings are still warm on the floor and people are digging up
[02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:31.300]  dirt on the official story I think we're catching up and that's why we see these
[02:47:31.300 --> 02:47:35.620]  concurrent efforts in Congress and other venues to destroy the internet with
[02:47:35.620 --> 02:47:41.140]  sipsa and sopa and so forth they want to they want to curtail the information
[02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:45.580]  revolution they want to take away our guns it is a full spectrum attack and
[02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:50.820]  really that's not bad news because we are waiting thus far the fact that we
[02:47:50.820 --> 02:47:54.340]  are still exercising our freedom talking about these issues educating our
[02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:57.940]  fellow human beings about what is really going on that's right just having the
[02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:02.300]  will to get in these murderers face and say do whatever you got to do we're
[02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:06.140]  coming at you and we're not backing off that right there when you've got good on
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:10.860]  your side is an immovable force if we just can if more of us should stand up
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:15.260]  and start walking at the enemy nothing can stop us and there are more people
[02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:18.700]  awake out there than we then we ever know I mean I've seen there's a lot of
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:21.940]  people who are awake and just they're passive right now because they think
[02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:25.620]  they're powerless and so at the same time that we're trying to wake people up
[02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:28.900]  we also have to convince them and let them know we don't have to talk talk
[02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:33.660]  them in anything let them know how much power they have to change what is going
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:38.820]  on because when you have this the steel pull of apathy one little pebble in
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:43.300]  there he sends ripples across the entire pond you keep on doing that or you
[02:48:43.300 --> 02:48:47.100]  drop a boulder every now and then and you've changed the whole game so as long
[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:51.780]  as we continue to make our efforts never surrender because we have everything to
[02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:57.340]  lose everything to lose and nothing to gain by surrender we will win this I am
[02:48:57.340 --> 02:49:01.100]  fully confident absolutely and and we have no future if we don't I mean it's
[02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:03.820]  not like this is just some corrupt group that wants to run stuff these are you
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:07.780]  Genesis they have a hellish future planned for us we've already seen the
[02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:12.980]  opening salvos of that but for the average person out there who does feel
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:17.700]  powerless they need to understand every little thing they do together really
[02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:23.780]  will move mountains and that's a problem though and I want to be clear just
[02:49:23.780 --> 02:49:27.700]  five six years ago the globalists were still very arrogant and they were and
[02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:31.900]  so they were weak now they're scared their white papers are scared now
[02:49:31.900 --> 02:49:35.740]  they're paying attention and so they're going to pull all sorts of stuff now
[02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:39.340]  they know they're losing the initiative and that we're gaining the initiative and
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:44.580]  so watch out folks they're no longer just being arrogant anymore now they're
[02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:48.380]  beginning to understand yeah they are desperate psychopaths right now and that
[02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:52.340]  is very dangerous like I said the double-edged sword this is not time to
[02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:55.260]  pat ourselves on the back that we figured this out this is time to be ever

[02:54:38.220 --> 02:54:44.220]  story's ridiculous I told you I saw that in their mind I saw that from knowing
[02:54:44.220 --> 02:54:47.980]  them and now they're putting it out in army reports that the Tea Party works
[02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:53.060]  with Al-Qaeda they're gonna convert it purely over saying we're the terrorist
[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:56.900]  you now see them publicly running Al-Qaeda as they always have the foreign
[02:54:56.900 --> 02:55:02.100]  banks that run our country they could release a bio weapon I see a lot of
[02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:05.740]  hype in that in the cards yeah I mean they're gonna hit us with a lot of stuff
[02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:12.220]  at once a war a bio-release say I ran did it it won't matter if the story
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:16.900]  doesn't make sense because it's all the hype at the moment and cowards
[02:55:16.900 --> 02:55:22.580]  throughout media and government buying what known liars say we'll enable the
[02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:26.540]  official story to at least hang out there it's important for all of us is
[02:55:26.540 --> 02:55:30.980]  that we'll be shut down at that point to understand we're trying to back them
[02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:34.740]  off right now but this is like the Death Star orbiting you know the planet to
[02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:38.900]  shoot the moon on the far side to clear the fire I mean we're going in all of
[02:55:38.900 --> 02:55:42.460]  us you the listeners trying to expose them at their criminals so that they
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:46.220]  don't feel like they can get away with it but if they think they can the skies
[02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:50.180]  the limit Holland Vanden Neunehoff your comments on the type of targets you
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:55.020]  think they'll hit well they are not going to stop that we can be assured of
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:55:59.020]  that and they do not care about a body count they've already killed 2,000 people
[02:55:59.020 --> 02:56:04.020]  with fast and furious trying to get a gun control agenda that failed and so
[02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:07.300]  that's they're not going to stop from slaughtering innocents even more
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:11.700]  innocents they may go for children that would that is that was the Dunblane
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:15.980]  massacre in England that's got the moderate gun control agenda started in
[02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:20.340]  that country was a massacre of school children children of course in this
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:24.580]  country seen children killed in schools time and time again usually by shooters
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:29.140]  or a delt up on psychotropic substances that's right they wind up a guy who's
[02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:33.100]  always under government psychiatric care usually even psyops roll them into a
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:38.460]  McDonald's exactly and how are they going to get gun control in this country
[02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:43.220]  that's another question I mean we were already seeing it in play we see the
[02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:47.620]  threads that they're weaving in these stories the Sikh shooter he was on the
[02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:51.560]  SPLC's watch list since the year 2000 of course you know that the Southern
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:55.460]  Poverty Law Center the SPLC is hip deep with Homeland Security in fact they
[02:56:55.460 --> 02:56:59.820]  serve in an advisory capacity and in a noble lie which of course you can
[02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:04.220]  purchase through info wars examining the Oklahoma City bombing the SPLC had
[02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:09.060]  prior knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing according to the FBI's own
[02:57:09.060 --> 02:57:13.220]  teletypes in fact later on they bragged about having informants in and around
[02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:19.220]  McVeigh so we have the SPLC watching the Sikh shooter also on a watch list that
[02:57:19.220 --> 02:57:23.940]  serves Homeland Security so perhaps people who are being monitored by Homeland
[02:57:23.940 --> 02:57:28.500]  Security for suspicious activity or by the SPLC which is an extension of Homeland
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:33.260]  Security perhaps those people will be denied their gun rights mental health
[02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:37.500]  we're seeing mental health played up a lot if you have ODD oppositional
[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:41.540]  disorder as defined by the DSM you might be deprived of your gun rights and
[02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:45.980]  that's not exaggeration recently believe it could tuck your Tennessee TV show
[02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:50.260]  contestant on the show preppers he was he had all his guns taken away because
[02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:55.540]  it was judged that he was mentally ill for for stocking up on food no we had him
[02:57:55.540 --> 02:58:00.820]  on the show no judge no jury no law that came and took his guns this is what
[02:58:00.820 --> 02:58:04.860]  they do I wonder if they can have their guns taken for being terrorists and
[02:58:04.860 --> 02:58:08.740]  shipping guns to Mexico of course not and like you mentioned the fact that
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:13.500]  they're now they're wargaming the Tea Party lying in itself with al-Qaeda well
[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:16.220]  we see that the military is working with al-Qaeda overseas they're just
[02:58:16.220 --> 02:58:20.540]  projecting onto us out like that's all they're doing yeah you're right they're
[02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:25.100]  projecting on to us who they are I mean take how crazy that is the Tea Party is
[02:58:25.100 --> 02:58:29.260]  so Islamophobic on average it make your head spin I mean you know the average
[02:58:29.260 --> 02:58:32.660]  Tea Party thing they have dartboards throwing pictures at midladen now they
[02:58:32.660 --> 02:58:38.180]  say the Tea Party work I mean this folks this isn't a Pentagon report incredible
