[00:00.000 --> 00:16.300]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:16.300 --> 00:24.960]  does he live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[00:24.960 --> 00:35.160]  I've been watching and I've been waiting for the light to my right to say we are
[00:35.160 --> 00:43.040]  on air because I love the great responsibility and the honor to be here
[00:43.040 --> 00:48.480]  talking to you thank you so much for joining us on this transmission it is
[00:48.480 --> 00:56.920]  the 20th day of September 2012 on this Thursday edition now yesterday we had
[00:56.920 --> 01:05.440]  Gerald Salente on the broadcast and so many people have emailed my office and
[01:05.440 --> 01:08.920]  called my office and I've seen the comments it's something like 300,000
[01:08.920 --> 01:12.840]  views just on one version of the video there's a bunch of other versions over
[01:12.840 --> 01:17.520]  a million views of an interview I did last week with Gerald Salente on info
[01:17.520 --> 01:23.080]  wash nightly news now it's an hour and seven minutes long and on the news I
[01:23.080 --> 01:26.920]  have the luxury of doing a commercial free because prison planet TV subscriber
[01:26.920 --> 01:31.800]  though a lot of cable systems and British television they download the
[01:31.800 --> 01:34.920]  shows each day and then kind of edit them together and put little special
[01:34.920 --> 01:40.680]  vignettes out well an example once a week on mainline British Sky television
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.880]  they have a two-hour special with the show so it's getting out there but for
[01:44.880 --> 01:48.440]  people watching prison planet on TV you saw the hour and seven minute
[01:48.440 --> 01:51.960]  interview and folks are saying there's something special about this interview
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.880]  probably because in the first half of it I held my tongue and I got important
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.040]  points to make I've got it in you know an intellect that has some interesting
[02:02.040 --> 02:08.640]  observations but but Gerald is such a informative person when he just rolls
[02:08.640 --> 02:12.960]  with the information and I think my energy adds to his energy and vice versa
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.000]  so I thought I would air this here today so when we come back from break we're
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.440]  gonna air it'll take about an hour and a half with radio because you've got
[02:22.440 --> 02:28.160]  commercials to go through all of this here and he covers it all the the
[02:28.160 --> 02:32.480]  engineered financial collapse the tyranny but also ways to combat and
[02:32.480 --> 02:37.720]  stand against this so it's a very important interview and undoubtedly the
[02:37.720 --> 02:42.600]  most powerful I've ever done with Gerald Salente so please tell your friends

[05:13.080 --> 05:17.320]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[05:17.320 --> 05:20.880]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[05:20.880 --> 05:24.960]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own

[08:49.200 --> 08:53.440]  interspersing a lot of really big news with the one the only Gerald Salente
[08:53.440 --> 08:57.760]  the top trends forecaster we're gonna be looking at Obama appeals against
[08:57.760 --> 09:03.680]  court ruling that strikes down the NDAA constitution killing system even though
[09:03.680 --> 09:08.360]  he says he's against the NDAA he helped write it and then pushed for its passage
[09:08.360 --> 09:11.640]  and then signed it but he's still against it we're gonna be looking at that
[09:11.640 --> 09:14.560]  we're gonna be looking at the takeover by the federal government of the cyber
[09:14.560 --> 09:20.800]  security and the internet we now have a leak confirmed leak of the executive
[09:20.800 --> 09:24.520]  order by Obama being passed around to media heads the total takeover of the
[09:24.520 --> 09:30.280]  web folks this is a serious tyranny we're entering now Gerald Salente of
[09:30.280 --> 09:34.000]  course has had many best-selling books he's predicted many of the things that
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.480]  have unfolded you can find out more about his trends journal on the website
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.120]  we're gonna be giving you here in a moment but he has been calling the Tea
[09:43.120 --> 09:47.120]  Party before it materialized the collapse of the euro the riots in
[09:47.120 --> 09:51.220]  Europe years and years before and he said a year and a half ago he said when
[09:51.220 --> 09:56.360]  Bernanke says he's not gonna have QE3 you watch they've got to do it because
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.160]  we'll implode if they don't and we'll have inflation and maybe hyperinflation
[10:01.160 --> 10:05.560]  if they do and so that is the path that central banks always take and remember
[10:05.560 --> 10:09.800]  they promise no QE3 then they said okay you're demanding it maybe a little now
[10:09.800 --> 10:15.160]  they said QE unlimited and we have our article here at info wars.com today that
[10:15.160 --> 10:21.160]  I wrote new banker bailout disguised as QE3 85 billion the media is saying 40
[10:21.160 --> 10:26.440]  billion that's that's just part of it 40 billion a month to go buy private
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.920]  derivatives from the banks so it's really a banker bailout a direct tax but
[10:30.920 --> 10:34.720]  total it's 85 billion a month that we have the press release from the private
[10:34.720 --> 10:40.240]  Federal Reserve and he's gonna break down exactly what this means the
[10:40.240 --> 10:45.600]  mechanics of it and what it's really doing and how it ties into the whole
[10:45.600 --> 10:49.600]  LIBOR scandal and how these banks are all working in concert and then we're
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.680]  gonna pick his brain about now that he's been accurate in predicting this when
[10:55.680 --> 11:00.680]  they promised they wouldn't what the aftermath will mean and what the time
[11:00.680 --> 11:05.040]  frame is Max Kaiser who's also got a really good head on the shoulders and
[11:05.040 --> 11:11.280]  work with George Soros's son as a top stockbroker he's he is doesn't got said
[11:11.280 --> 11:15.480]  something I've never heard him say he said by next April there will be a
[11:15.480 --> 11:20.280]  giant total collapse whatever that means he's on next week to break it down but
[11:20.280 --> 11:27.120]  that's my word on this we're going to get Gerald Salentes take on it all the
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.200]  head of the Trends Research Institute Gerald thank you for joining us on
[11:31.200 --> 11:36.960]  short notice well you've got the floor tell us what this means and do you
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.800]  agree with my analysis that it's just another transfer of wealth to the
[11:40.800 --> 11:47.040]  kleptocrats you nailed it Alex in your introduction this is nothing more than a
[11:47.040 --> 11:52.280]  bailout another bailout to the two bigs to fail that's where all the money is
[11:52.280 --> 11:58.440]  going it's the same scheme around the world they make it appear you read the
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.440]  headlines and and here's the here's the phony headlines you're ready for this
[12:03.440 --> 12:10.280]  one this is come coming from the Wall Street Journal Fed acts to fix jobs
[12:10.280 --> 12:17.440]  market isn't that nice they're going to fix the jobs market oh yeah just like
[12:17.440 --> 12:23.480]  they fixed it before how much did they pump into the system well depending on
[12:23.480 --> 12:30.240]  whose numbers you're looking at when you go back to 2008 beginning of course with
[12:30.240 --> 12:38.880]  the Bush programs with tarp we're talking about 23 trillion dollars oh and
[12:38.880 --> 12:46.680]  what's the job market doing son of a gun didn't Obama say when he tried when he
[12:46.680 --> 12:56.560]  pushed through the stimulus in 2009 that by 2010 we're going to see 7.2
[12:56.560 --> 13:03.120]  unemployment and it's going to go down from there hey what are we at 8.1 and
[13:03.120 --> 13:09.120]  why is it only 8.1 because they don't add the people and drop out so as you
[13:09.120 --> 13:16.040]  well know when you look at people like a John Williams shadow stats we're looking
[13:16.040 --> 13:23.240]  at 22% and just before I get back into the QEN list the reason why this
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.000]  depression looks different than the other one is that you don't see people
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.680]  lining up on the streets in bread lines because they have a new scam it's called
[13:33.680 --> 13:39.240]  food stamps that's right give them food stamps shut them up and get them out of
[13:39.240 --> 13:45.080]  the movie and that's why people can't see the real pain so when we're looking at
[13:45.080 --> 13:51.320]  this quantitative easing scheme we have to understand that when they talk about
[13:51.320 --> 13:59.640]  a global economy it is indeed a global economy in every sense I have been
[13:59.640 --> 14:07.800]  saying for the last several months that I would put my reputation on the line
[14:07.800 --> 14:15.920]  that Bernanke was going to push through quantitative easing before election day
[14:15.920 --> 14:21.760]  you don't have to be a trend forecaster to figure this one out all you have to
[14:21.760 --> 14:27.600]  do is look back a little bit Alan Greenspan did the same thing for George
[14:27.600 --> 14:34.400]  Bush the first but he did it a little too late and then Clinton squeaked in and
[14:34.400 --> 14:41.640]  also because Perot grabbed 19% of the vote away from Bush so they do it all
[14:41.640 --> 14:49.520]  the time it's the criminal operation and you made it 100% clear the money is
[14:49.520 --> 14:59.160]  only going to the Goldman Sachs gang the Merrill Lynch mob the JP Morgan Chase
[14:59.160 --> 15:06.840]  criminals you know all of those guys out there that have been fined in the tens
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.600]  or not hundreds of millions of dollars for doing their dirty deals and then
[15:12.600 --> 15:18.840]  never having to admit nor deny that we get any wrongdoing and the wonderful
[15:18.840 --> 15:25.560]  Obama that all the liberals love under his attorney general holder who used to
[15:25.560 --> 15:31.680]  work for the preen one of the premier white collar crime syndicate law firms
[15:31.680 --> 15:37.800]  they haven't brought anybody up on charges so now you go overseas this past
[15:37.800 --> 15:44.520]  week on Wednesday the German Supreme Court you have to put a photo of the
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.360]  German Supreme Court up Alex these little cats in these red little uniforms
[15:50.360 --> 15:57.360]  with these cute little red hats these little wimpy SOB's they just violated
[15:57.360 --> 16:04.640]  the German Constitution 38,000 Germans had signed on to this that to find the
[16:04.640 --> 16:09.880]  European stability mechanism which is white shoe boy language to steal the
[16:09.880 --> 16:14.960]  money from the taxpayers deposit it directly into the banks and give it to
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.560]  the hedge funds the brokerages the investors and the bankers that made
[16:19.560 --> 16:26.320]  bed bets at the tune of 700 billion euros and payback all the bed bets they
[16:26.320 --> 16:32.360]  they made but because you remember the white shoe boy club we're going to give
[16:32.360 --> 16:38.560]  you interest so they violated their Constitution they even admitted they did
[16:38.560 --> 16:45.240]  it for economic purposes and then last on January on September 5th as I was
[16:45.240 --> 16:53.160]  saying Mario Draghi the head of the European Central Bank for those who
[16:53.160 --> 17:00.360]  don't know who Mario Draghi is he was the vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs
[17:00.360 --> 17:08.000]  gang European division yes the Goldman Sachs gang that cooked the books to bring
[17:08.000 --> 17:16.840]  the Greeks into the eurozone that Mario Draghi he announced just like this you
[17:16.840 --> 17:23.640]  said this endless QE he announced they're gonna buy up all of those worthless
[17:23.640 --> 17:33.400]  Italian Spanish Portuguese Irish Greek bonds non-stop all we're seeing here and
[17:33.400 --> 17:39.120]  you could throw China into this loop as well it's all connected they are
[17:39.120 --> 17:47.400]  printing non-stop counterfeit digital money to give to their pals in the banks
[17:47.400 --> 17:53.280]  and the hedge funds so they could keep the scam going I'm not making this up
[17:53.280 --> 17:56.800]  no no no me I mean you're not there Gerald and just to interject the magnitude
[17:56.800 --> 18:01.560]  of this I played the clip on the radio today Ron Paul on television said we
[18:01.560 --> 18:07.480]  should quote be panicking right now but instead we have this mass Stockholm
[18:07.480 --> 18:11.920]  syndrome or this learned helplessness I guess the word could be normalcy bias
[18:11.920 --> 18:17.680]  quote country should be in panic over Fed's decision zero hedge info wars
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.360]  calm he said that one on CNN and Ron Paul's never talked like that the fact
[18:23.360 --> 18:29.280]  that they're not just doing QE3 but it's unlimited looting and then it it it
[18:29.280 --> 18:33.560]  comes as inflation for the general public it devalues the purchasing power
[18:33.560 --> 18:39.300]  they're buying 1.4 billion bullets giant black armored vehicles checkpoints the
[18:39.300 --> 18:43.760]  military's preparing for civil unrest worldwide and I saw what you're talking
[18:43.760 --> 18:50.000]  about Baroso over in the EU he said hey we need a total federal state run by the
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.160]  banks over these countries so they're capturing us by getting our governments
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.120]  that are their operatives to shine on to their fraudulent paper then they have
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.880]  their prostitute media the coin the term you coined tell us that it's our debt
[19:03.880 --> 19:09.280]  and then they're raising taxes to pay it to them my god they're gonna go all the
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.840]  way here Gerald so that's my question to you why how do they think they're going
[19:14.840 --> 19:19.600]  to get away with this because when they say unlimited and they're gonna buy all
[19:19.600 --> 19:25.960]  the derivatives that these criminals created and spend 85 billion a month just
[19:25.960 --> 19:29.640]  here in the US giving it to them I mean what's next are they gonna demand our
[19:29.640 --> 19:38.320]  daughters yeah it's one banking syndicate it's what Rothschild had said
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.680]  they would make it so complicated that people wouldn't understand it until they

[24:40.800 --> 24:50.480]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones here this is a quote now this
[24:50.480 --> 24:59.080]  isn't a left-wing subversive newspaper this is the front page story last week
[24:59.080 --> 25:05.520]  out of the financial times the financial times here's the headline
[25:05.520 --> 25:14.400]  Draghi helps out Obama campaign Barack Obama's chance of re-election as US
[25:14.400 --> 25:22.440]  president rose on Thursday and the words that did it were not his but Mario
[25:22.440 --> 25:28.800]  Draghi's long before mr. Obama stood up to accept the Democratic nomination in
[25:28.800 --> 25:34.400]  Charlotte North Carolina the head of the European Central Bank had sketched
[25:34.400 --> 25:41.560]  out a new plan to buy the bonds of the troubled eurozone countries that will
[25:41.560 --> 25:47.800]  not move the polls it will not move a single vote but mr. Draghi has lowered
[25:47.800 --> 25:55.000]  the gravest of risks to mr. Obama's pre-election meltdown fear of the
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.640]  pre-election meltdown fear of the eurozone that would have blown up
[25:59.640 --> 26:07.400]  banks pulverized Wall Street and routed a financial a fragile US economy back
[26:07.400 --> 26:15.000]  into recession they all know what the deal is it's right here in black and
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.280]  white it's from the financial times they know that the system is collapsing
[26:21.280 --> 26:26.400]  they're going to do everything they can to prop it up and they're doing it what
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.840]  does it mean not only inflation and again you know I do trends in the news
[26:31.840 --> 26:38.240]  features as part of the subscription to the trends journal each day last week I
[26:38.240 --> 26:45.800]  announced on trends in the news I was buying gold again I had predict I had
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.840]  forecasted that gold prices would begin to spike they've gone up probably about
[26:51.840 --> 26:58.280]  80 90 dollars since I said that again you can see where this is going they're
[26:58.280 --> 27:02.280]  printing this counterfeit money this digital money not worth the paper it's
[27:02.280 --> 27:08.960]  not printed on devaluing everything else forcing commodity prices higher and
[27:08.960 --> 27:15.120]  here's the one that no one ever talks about anymore hardly in the old days
[27:15.120 --> 27:19.960]  when I was a young boy they used to have a thing that they used to promote in
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.920]  this country that made it seem like it was a good thing to do for wise people
[27:24.920 --> 27:31.320]  savings oh you remember that quaint word savings you work and you put a little
[27:31.320 --> 27:35.240]  money away you work and you put a little money away and you put in the banks and
[27:35.240 --> 27:41.360]  you know what they would do with it they would give you interest on it yes back
[27:41.360 --> 27:45.640]  in the old days you would put money in the bank and they would give you
[27:45.640 --> 27:52.200]  interest on it interest that would be ahead of inflation most of the times now
[27:52.200 --> 27:57.960]  what do they do they give you nothing they take your money they hardly give you
[27:57.960 --> 28:04.080]  any interest rates and you know why because America's public enemy number
[28:04.080 --> 28:13.520]  one Osama bin Bernanke has pledged and has kept doing the same dirty deal
[28:13.520 --> 28:20.000]  keeping interest rates near zero they say they're going to keep them near zero
[28:20.000 --> 28:29.600]  or at zero until 2015 that means everybody out there that used to especially
[28:29.600 --> 28:36.400]  the elderly that used to put money away and build a nest egg they got a goose a
[28:36.400 --> 28:44.360]  they got zip not a nothing and what they're also doing by doing this is
[28:44.360 --> 28:49.800]  they're forcing people that do want to get a little return on their money to
[28:49.800 --> 28:56.240]  play their criminal operation games like investing in the stock market and let

[33:10.800 --> 33:15.920]  question the signal has been sent that they can rob anything they are taking
[33:15.920 --> 33:20.240]  general police turning them into SWAT teams they are openly preparing to
[33:20.240 --> 33:23.840]  arrest people and put them in reeducation camps so I guess it is
[33:23.840 --> 33:28.840]  confirmed like you're issued last quarter next train to Auschwitz they are
[33:28.840 --> 33:33.640]  going the pure tyranny round but here's the question break down from your you
[33:33.640 --> 33:38.120]  know great acumen and gravitas and looking into the future on this but now
[33:38.120 --> 33:41.160]  it's becoming pretty clear I mean you were getting called Pesmas porn four
[33:41.160 --> 33:44.360]  years ago in the New York Times now here it is they're gonna keep telling
[33:44.360 --> 33:47.600]  everybody everything's wonderful while they dig in while they move offshore
[33:47.600 --> 33:52.680]  while they get armed guards but clearly people are losing confidence in the
[33:52.680 --> 33:58.280]  system so what are they planning to do how bad will it get what's the time frame
[33:58.280 --> 34:07.920]  all right what they're planning to do is making headline news it was 9-11 11
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.920]  years later with what's going I've said this in the beginning when they first
[34:13.920 --> 34:21.800]  started talking about recovery we did a trend alert on it back in 2008 economy
[34:21.800 --> 34:27.200]  goes down they go to war you got it no recovery cover-up and they're going to
[34:27.200 --> 34:33.280]  take us to war when all else fails can't you hear the war drums beating and
[34:33.280 --> 34:38.480]  that's what they're going to do look at their headlines today what was it
[34:38.480 --> 34:47.200]  University in North Dakota Texas Valparaiso the fear and hysteria already
[34:47.200 --> 34:53.880]  vibrating through the media go back and I you know I remember it like it was
[34:53.880 --> 35:01.680]  yesterday I'll never forget back in August of 2011 you go back and you look
[35:01.680 --> 35:08.440]  at George W. Bush's popularity rating right after he got elected you look at
[35:08.440 --> 35:14.920]  how many people were so disgusted with him and then you look how it changed after
[35:14.920 --> 35:24.360]  9-11 they're doing the same thing now they're taking us to war and as you
[35:24.360 --> 35:30.280]  will know that war drum every you think it goes away and then it keeps coming
[35:30.280 --> 35:36.640]  back with Israel talking about attacking Iran and then you look at the news
[35:36.640 --> 35:45.320]  today Alex how many by the way this has nothing to do with that movie about you
[35:45.320 --> 35:50.400]  know Muhammad that's like saying that World War one began little boys and
[35:50.400 --> 35:56.680]  girls when the Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated at Sarajevo this is that
[35:56.680 --> 36:04.040]  this movie is only one match in a matchbox of a volatile situations that's
[36:04.040 --> 36:07.960]  going to like well she's a World War two analogy I mean all the forces are
[36:07.960 --> 36:13.120]  lining up it's being prepared they've sent the fleets to menace the Chinese to
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.520]  keep you know investing and going along with the white shoe boys have they're
[36:16.520 --> 36:22.320]  encircling Russia they've got proxy wars using Al Qaeda and Libby in Syria the
[36:22.320 --> 36:25.360]  Russians have pointed it out I'm outside with the Russians but they're not the
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.400]  ones looting my country and the white shoe boys really think they're gonna push
[36:30.400 --> 36:35.040]  Russia and now even China around these are guys that make 40 to 1 bets and
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.240]  then just take your bank account so I mean I have to look at this and say as
[36:40.240 --> 36:44.680]  Ron Paul said we better panic I agree with you they are definitely
[36:44.680 --> 36:50.200]  this is real this is real I'm like I mean pick up the pick up the papers look at
[36:50.200 --> 36:58.160]  your site look at all of them Tunisia Yemen Sudan Somalia Algeria Bangladesh
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.040]  Lebanon name the country I mean they could see it right in front of
[37:03.040 --> 37:09.440]  everybody's face it is all exploding in front of us and now the CIA produced
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.800]  video showing you know Muhammad the Prophet murdering women and stuff you
[37:14.800 --> 37:19.840]  know with horses I mean just designed to incite radical elements I mean this
[37:19.840 --> 37:25.120]  this is order out of chaos this is insanity and and here's the reality is
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.080]  I see it you know I talk about buying gold and investing in this and that if
[37:30.080 --> 37:34.480]  the United States or Israel goes to war with Iran I've said this many times
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.240]  those things aren't gonna be worth anything because life is gonna be so
[37:38.240 --> 37:43.080]  miserable you know how they say generals keep fighting the last war there's a
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.840]  reason for it because they can't win the one they're fighting and have no clue
[37:47.840 --> 37:52.160]  on how to fight the next one this is gonna be a very different war this is
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.560]  gonna be wars of weapons of mass destruction it's going to be wars of
[37:56.560 --> 38:05.680]  polluted aquifers and and and suitcase size nuclear weapons it's going to be
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.560]  the worst horror that science fiction can make up and we already see the
[38:10.560 --> 38:16.080]  technology it's in place they're using it on us whether it's drones watching us
[38:16.080 --> 38:22.600]  surveillance all of the technology is there to wage a war of weapons of mass
[38:22.600 --> 38:28.960]  destruction now it's not an atom bomb with ICBMs it's not tanks rolling across
[38:28.960 --> 38:35.960]  it's not jets it's a different war and they're taking us to it the same people
[38:35.960 --> 38:42.600]  that took us to Vietnam that took us to Iraq that took us to Afghanistan and
[38:42.600 --> 38:48.480]  before that took us to South Korea to the Korean War that lost every war are
[38:48.480 --> 38:56.840]  now taking us to the first great war of the 21st century the timeline is on time
[38:56.840 --> 39:07.400]  go back the crash of 1929 the Great Depression currency wars trade wars
[39:07.400 --> 39:14.080]  world war the panic of 08 the Great Depression it's a depra you know what
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.960]  the numbers are in Spain they're about 40% unemployment they're saying 25 same
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.760]  in Greece same in Portugal same in Ireland and you look around Italy
[39:24.760 --> 39:31.040]  officially is over 10% France over 10% the United States as John Williams
[39:31.040 --> 39:38.680]  points out shadow stats 22% you can see it the depression is here the currency
[39:38.680 --> 39:44.360]  wars are on and now you're hearing Mittens Romney and others talking about
[39:44.360 --> 39:53.600]  trade wars the next is world war what are people waiting for man you're
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.280]  absolutely right and we've been so close to the problem the dumb down sheepled
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.680]  who just want to watch their sitcoms and party they're starting to wake up a
[40:02.680 --> 40:07.120]  little bit but we're almost on the opposite end we've been so close to
[40:07.120 --> 40:11.160]  knowing this by researching history and trying to be informed yourself myself
[40:11.160 --> 40:16.320]  so many others Ron Paul Webster Tarpley the list of Dr. Paul Craig Roberts that
[40:16.320 --> 40:21.320]  we're almost like the sheeple in a way but I'm getting chills right now because
[40:21.320 --> 40:25.160]  we've been so close to it we're almost expecting it and ready for it but then I
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.800]  have the realization that this is real I mean this is really happening and then
[40:29.800 --> 40:34.160]  you talk about the generals fighting the last war the joint chiefs even Dempsey
[40:34.160 --> 40:38.000]  who's a warmonger this is like three joint chiefs of staff chairman in a row
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.720]  saying don't blame us if they go to war we don't want a war you got massage heads
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.720]  resigning over it you you've got all anybody who knows anything like Colonel
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.400]  Schaefer saying we don't want this there's a reason real war fighters who
[40:53.400 --> 40:56.840]  usually love a new war do not want to enter this because you're right it's
[40:56.840 --> 41:02.400]  asymmetrical it's insane and they also realize it's globalist bankers who want
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.480]  to sit back from their yachts and offshore islands and play the west off
[41:07.480 --> 41:12.040]  against the east so they can consolidate power and get a police state out of it
[41:12.040 --> 41:17.560]  people realize this is such a hell war that they're creating and it's got Russia
[41:17.560 --> 41:23.960]  looming and the white shoe boys who were so arrogant and Hutzpah bravada
[41:23.960 --> 41:29.320]  hubris filled are probably I mean there's a lot of experts a lot of top
[41:29.320 --> 41:33.840]  brass I've talked to on and off air they say this could go thermonuclear I mean
[41:33.840 --> 41:36.760]  this is gonna get out of hand this is gonna make World War two look like a
[41:36.760 --> 41:40.360]  cakewalk so I hope all the good old boys that talk about glass parking lotting
[41:40.360 --> 41:44.200]  all the Arabs I hope they're ready for $20 gallon gas that happens I hope
[41:44.200 --> 41:47.440]  they're ready for bio weapons in the streets I hope they're ready for cities
[41:47.440 --> 41:51.240]  burning when the welfare people riot because this isn't a game you know
[41:51.240 --> 41:54.560]  Homeland Security thinks it's cute they're running ads about get ready for a
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.800]  zombie apocalypse as an art type of the public they are it's like Satan's running
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.920]  this or something Gerald I mean you couldn't come up with a more diabolical
[42:03.920 --> 42:09.040]  geopolitical plan than what these Harvard Wall Street scumbag crazy people
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.200]  have done because you know what I have been freaking out like Ron Paul says for
[42:13.200 --> 42:16.720]  years I knew it was coming but now it's not over the hill it's not down the
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.880]  street it's six inches in front of our nose and it stinks like a pile of dead
[42:20.880 --> 42:24.240]  corpses and they're telling me it's pumpkin pie they're telling me it's
[42:24.240 --> 42:29.200]  key lime pie to eat it I mean how far does this damn insanity have to go and
[42:29.200 --> 42:34.040]  yeah you're right it's exactly what is it's right in front of our noses you know
[42:34.040 --> 42:39.720]  there's I look at these people that are in charge it's not only what they say
[42:39.720 --> 42:45.640]  it's who says it and how could anybody believe them just by looking at them you
[42:45.640 --> 42:50.920]  know what I look at these people it's like they're like an anti-human race it's
[42:50.920 --> 42:55.400]  it's they're they're not human they're anti-human all of their actions again
[42:55.400 --> 43:05.040]  they pollute our our water they poison our food they destroy our minds they
[43:05.040 --> 43:11.080]  wreak havoc on the earth this isn't human they're anti-human all of their
[43:11.080 --> 43:16.840]  actions are anti-human you know they say Obama you know he's he's some Kenya
[43:16.840 --> 43:22.120]  he's from here he said I think this cats them galaxy nine and right behind them
[43:22.120 --> 43:27.800]  is Mittens and all of them who's even we're I'm telling you there's these are
[43:27.800 --> 43:34.960]  they're doing anti-human deeds these are not things that conscious people who
[43:34.960 --> 43:41.040]  care about the human race do you know you you were mentioning about what
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.320]  they all of these people in the destruction that they bring us think of
[43:45.320 --> 43:52.120]  Dwight D Eisenhower five star general supreme commander of the allied forces
[43:52.120 --> 43:59.720]  two-term president and a Republican he tells us that the military industrial
[43:59.720 --> 44:04.080]  complex is taking over the nation it will rob us of the genius of our
[44:04.080 --> 44:10.160]  scientists the sweat of the laborers and the future of the children now think
[44:10.160 --> 44:18.360]  about this Alex what was the major war that Eisenhower got us into how about
[44:18.360 --> 44:26.040]  none how about it was Eisenhower who ended the Korean war no he wasn't like
[44:26.040 --> 44:31.880]  Obama with his sleeves rolled up isn't that cat of a workman he's always out
[44:31.880 --> 44:39.760]  in the campaign trail or Romney who's been running forever since 2006 and
[44:39.760 --> 44:50.160]  before and Eisenhower also said that anyone that seeks the office is either
[44:50.160 --> 45:00.040]  crazy or an ego maniac and there you have it you have crazy and eco maniac you
[45:00.040 --> 45:08.760]  have fraud and fraudster they're right in front of our eyes Max Kaiser has a good
[45:08.760 --> 45:12.120]  analogy and I remember seeing it in the press at the time some of the stock
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.200]  brokers because of the crisis of the towers stocks were going up and down
[45:16.200 --> 45:19.600]  wildly and they were making millions of dollars in the towers and they stayed
[45:19.600 --> 45:26.040]  there as the buildings collapsed just to make money and and and that's what the
[45:26.040 --> 45:32.080]  globalists are doing I liken them to cancer and cancer is programmed to take
[45:32.080 --> 45:36.880]  it all because I was making the point that you know to Max Kaiser that that
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.520]  cancer if it had a consciousness would think it was winning it's taken over at
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.920]  reprograms nothing can stop it and it's actually destroying the host and he said
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.800]  yeah it's programmed to take it all and these people really are cancer that's
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.080]  why you say they're anti-human all of us make mistakes none of us are perfect
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.560]  but these people actually well it's basic criminology it's like a lot of
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.880]  criminals rob banks not just for money it's fun and for them it's fun I mean I
[46:01.880 --> 46:05.840]  was reading about Hitler also watching some of the films he would go out to the
[46:05.840 --> 46:10.920]  fronts the Russian front and others and for days he would stay up drinking
[46:10.920 --> 46:15.800]  coffee and eating pastries and and taking speed to watch through big
[46:15.800 --> 46:21.520]  telescopes cities being bombed and burning buildings and and and and he
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.040]  loved World War one he would violent he loved the dead bodies and the rotten
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.720]  dead people in the trenches they said man he was like a fish to water to that
[46:28.720 --> 46:33.480]  the black uniforms the skulls look at our police look at the systems we've got
[46:33.480 --> 46:39.400]  it's all that same black uniforms ring-raith outfits evil and a Stalin
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.080]  liked murder and death as well these people are sick these people it's
[46:43.080 --> 46:47.520]  beautiful to them it's beautiful what they're creating and and and they are
[46:47.520 --> 46:53.680]  cancer these people are cancer as I said they're members of the anti-human
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.240]  race and when people ask me when are things going to change and I keep saying
[46:58.240 --> 47:02.680]  it over and over again nothing is going to change until the individual changes
[47:02.680 --> 47:07.600]  and when enough individuals change they don't accept this kind of behavior from
[47:07.600 --> 47:13.680]  the people that want to lead them I've made this very clear I am not going to
[47:13.680 --> 47:20.360]  vote for president in this election I refuse to vote for a lesser of two evils
[47:20.360 --> 47:24.760]  I don't hang out with lesser of two evils I don't go out with them I don't
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.400]  do business with them I'll be damned if I'm going to vote for one to run my life
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.320]  and run my country and then people say well why don't you put a right in ballot
[47:35.320 --> 47:41.120]  to vote for so-and-so no because then that shows they use the numbers to show
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.560]  that you are promoting their system and you put you down as somebody that voted
[47:46.560 --> 47:52.720]  I will no longer be a part of this criminality and to again only speaking
[47:52.720 --> 47:57.680]  for myself you know my motto think for yourself I will not be part of this
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.440]  corrupt fam crime family that they like to call the Republicans and the
[48:03.440 --> 48:07.040]  Democrats well said you better off calling them the bananas of the
[48:07.040 --> 48:11.680]  Gambino absolutely you tell people where your motto of trends journal dot com
[48:11.680 --> 48:19.160]  trends research dot com came from I mean what was your dad today before you
[48:19.160 --> 48:23.560]  tell the story what was your dad if your dad was alive today seeing all this
[48:23.560 --> 48:29.280]  happen if if my grandfather was alive today seeing what happened I think they
[48:29.280 --> 48:32.280]  would think they'd woke him up in another planet but what would your dad say
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.360]  about this today well he would say you know he would say I'm glad I'm getting
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.440]  old and you don't have to live in this in this place anymore because I could
[48:40.440 --> 48:44.160]  because I can see where it's going when I was a little boy you know my mother
[48:44.160 --> 48:47.800]  used to want to get me out of the house I was such a trouble maker so on the week
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.520]  on Saturdays you know I find wild for business take me along with him I'd be
[48:51.520 --> 48:55.960]  shooting my mouth off and he'd look over at me in an Italian he'd say to me when
[48:55.960 --> 49:02.080]  I'm shooting running my mouth he say Papa Gallo parrot stop repeating what
[49:02.080 --> 49:08.120]  everybody else is saying and think for yourself and I heard that a couple of
[49:08.120 --> 49:14.360]  times and I respected my father as I did my aunts and uncles and the elders and I
[49:14.360 --> 49:21.800]  never wanted to make a fool of myself so before I opened my mouth number one I
[49:21.800 --> 49:26.920]  had I knew I had to know what I was talking about I had to have the facts
[49:26.920 --> 49:33.480]  and number the second one was I didn't want to repeat what everybody else was
[49:33.480 --> 49:37.560]  saying because that was the popular thing you know another funny thing I
[49:37.560 --> 49:43.480]  never rebelled you know my generation rebelled I looked up to my my elders I
[49:43.480 --> 49:49.440]  have a whole wall over here of all my ancestors because I knew that I didn't
[49:49.440 --> 49:53.760]  know and they knew that they know everything no but everything they knew
[49:53.760 --> 49:57.600]  that they taught me and that's the difference by the way of what's going
[49:57.600 --> 50:03.600]  on now young people have no reference point they don't remember when America
[50:03.600 --> 50:09.240]  used to have here's an arcane thought Alex there used to be a thing called
[50:09.240 --> 50:15.800]  hardware stores yeah before Home Depot before Lowe's they were all over the
[50:15.800 --> 50:20.000]  place it was a thing called an entrepreneur I love Mittens Romney gets
[50:20.000 --> 50:26.280]  out there and he brags about creating staples oh wonderful you put all those
[50:26.280 --> 50:30.680]  stationery stores used to be in every neighborhood out of business and now you
[50:30.680 --> 50:35.760]  could take home sixty to fifty a week after you work in staples and all your
[50:35.760 --> 50:41.240]  taxes and everything else comes out people have no reference point when
[50:41.240 --> 50:47.200]  there was styling quality in this country when we really built magnificent
[50:47.200 --> 50:54.640]  cities that are now going into the dust and as I say the only way I see America

[53:24.720 --> 53:29.280]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[53:29.280 --> 53:32.960]  e-foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I
[53:32.960 --> 53:36.400]  recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this
[53:36.400 --> 53:40.000]  was coming you know about their delicious long-term storeable foods the
[53:40.000 --> 53:43.560]  fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it's storage for
[53:43.560 --> 53:47.000]  25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost

[53:58.240 --> 54:17.120]  life on e-foods direct leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[54:17.120 --> 54:27.680]  order it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network so my question to you is time
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.240]  frames you've been absolutely I'm not kissing your butt it's true on target
[54:32.240 --> 54:35.680]  with everything you've talked about you know they're like oh things didn't
[54:35.680 --> 54:39.320]  collapse so lente well they're saying the collapse we're seeing isn't a
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.240]  collapse they're playing games they're messing with the numbers but now you
[54:43.240 --> 54:48.080]  said I guarantee if they're gonna do the QE they've done it so tell us what's
[54:48.080 --> 54:52.040]  coming next now that it's coming more into focus and you've obviously got
[54:52.040 --> 54:56.640]  some some of the lines a little bit more crisp clearly they're trying to hype up
[54:56.640 --> 55:00.440]  the Arabs with this fake video clearly they've turned Al Qaeda loose they put
[55:00.440 --> 55:03.760]  in all these countries clearly they're putting out all these fake bomb threats
[55:03.760 --> 55:09.760]  right now to to get the fear going so yes I see the preparatory fear mongering
[55:09.760 --> 55:14.240]  that I saw before 9-11 that you saw before 9-11 we can see them getting
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.240]  ready so what does that mean states terror attacks before the election TSA on
[55:18.240 --> 55:22.040]  the streets rolling out I know six months ago I confirmed nationwide every city
[55:22.040 --> 55:27.240]  had its TSA checkpoint kits and groups set up they're all waiting I mean
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.440]  clearly this has all been premeditated they've got the hammer risen over us how
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.320]  do you see it dropping what tips can you give people once it drops how bad will
[55:37.320 --> 55:43.720]  it get I believe that it's just as Mario Draghi and the new and the Financial
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.760]  Times reported they're going to hold this together before until the elections
[55:48.760 --> 55:53.920]  financially on the economic end all of this stimulus won't do anything as you
[55:53.920 --> 55:59.200]  clearly point out other than a rich enrich the very rich that's all it does
[55:59.200 --> 56:03.200]  it didn't do anything before why should it work now the same thing over in
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.800]  Europe and you look what's going on in China as well Brazil you go around the
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.880]  world it's all unraveling they're going I believe they're going to hold the
[56:12.880 --> 56:19.080]  economy together until after the election and we'll probably start seeing
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.320]  the unwinding happening around March I also believe that there's a high
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.720]  probability that we're not going to be thinking about the economy come election
[56:29.720 --> 56:36.520]  day as the geopolitical trends are now shaping up this is not going to stop
[56:36.520 --> 56:42.600]  the hate look terror Tuesdays where Obama signs off on how many drones they
[56:42.600 --> 56:48.800]  gonna send in to wipe out people the Afghan war that keeps getting worse look
[56:48.800 --> 56:53.960]  at the slaughter's every every day you're seeing slaughter's going on through a
[56:53.960 --> 57:01.040]  rock Africa is unraveling continually the strikers in South Africa Mali
[57:01.040 --> 57:05.800]  unraveling oh by the way that's happening as a result of the takedown of
[57:05.800 --> 57:12.120]  Gaddafi Syria turning into a hellish civil war Libya going in and never
[57:12.120 --> 57:19.800]  having ended the civil war that ramping up more destabilization in Europe so as
[57:19.800 --> 57:26.520]  I say it I believe that the economic collapse is more likely to happen around
[57:26.520 --> 57:36.000]  March or April as Max Kaiser points out and but a more of a geopolitical crises
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.280]  that is going to take people's minds off the minor issues of the presidential
[57:42.280 --> 57:46.520]  reality show I totally agree because World War one World War two but there's
[57:46.520 --> 57:51.760]  also famous letters from 600 700 years ago during you know 30 years 100 year
[57:51.760 --> 57:55.360]  wars between the French and the and the British who were actually the French
[57:55.360 --> 57:58.240]  Norman that had already conquered and they would write letters these are in
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.160]  the National Archives in England you can people can pull them up oh cousin I'm
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.960]  having troubles at home can we have a war just to get everybody killing each
[58:07.960 --> 58:12.040]  other but two royal families that are literally you know you could even tell
[58:12.040 --> 58:15.360]  the princes apart kind of like the czars and you know the brits when they
[58:15.360 --> 58:18.200]  were first cousins you know the two kings looked identical that was just a
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.760]  hundred years ago or less well but they and they would just have a war to kill
[58:22.760 --> 58:26.440]  off their young men and give them something to fight with I mean I mean
[58:26.440 --> 58:33.560]  this is so sick so you're right we'll be right back with more of this historic

[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:15.800]  Alex Jones show you're listening to the voice of well me Alex Jones I'm an
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.720]  extremist I I love freedom I hate tyrants and bullies and I believe that
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.480]  you should be able to enjoy the frizz of your labor again I admitted I'm an
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.600]  extremist and here's another extremist his name is Gerald Salente this is part
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.440]  of this marathon airing of an hour-plus interview I did on info wars nightly
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.320]  news that we're now transmitting to you broadcasting to you worldwide over the
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.360]  radio via GCN live.com as you said a year ago or was over a year ago you said
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.760]  the first great war of the 21st century that's where this leads and so once
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:53.040]  they've pumped everything up posed as saviors stole the money that they claim
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.120]  was to get the economy going they'll just have a whole bunch of giant wars and
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.240]  some terror attacks and start having TSA, grope our wives and children on the
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.400]  side of the highway and we'll all bow and fetch to them for keeping us safe and
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.040]  we just march into pure technocratic slavery and then I and now they got
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.640]  cybersecurity executive orders they admit shut down the web they're talking
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.720]  about shutting off people that don't like them and I guess they're gonna try to
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.840]  come arrest us Gerald I mean I mean I guess that's it yeah that's why we wrote
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.560]  that the I guess was it the spring trends journal all aboard next train to
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.960]  Auschwitz kiss those calories goodbye and you know whether you know it wasn't
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.800]  as though the people didn't know what was going on the people didn't stand up
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.560]  and take action just like they're not taking it now you mock my words Alex
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:48.080]  you're gonna see El Presidente of Los Estates and Edis I say that because the
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.560]  joint's turned into a banana Republic with it with the cops arrest a little
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.000]  kid in Pennsylvania I said Philadelphia a two-year-old kid two years old for
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.760]  peeing on a lamppost this is what they do in third-world nations they crack down
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.480]  on the little people so what you're going to see is when El Presidente hits the
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.920]  stage like he did when he started the Libyan war with that you know gravitas
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:18.920]  is on the on the commander-in-chief and this is why we're doing what we have to
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:26.120]  do the yellow ribbons come out the flags go up everybody salutes and then they
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:31.200]  go to war they do it all the time and they're going to do it again false flag
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.960]  or real to me it's in the cards and you can see the preparation for collapse of
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:43.920]  society one solutions to counteract this again I keep saying this it goes back
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.680]  to the human spirit it's what you're doing what I'm doing with the people
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.720]  that you are working with you and me the people that are listening to you and to
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.280]  me that want to make a positive difference you know I'm up here in
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.480]  Kingston in New York uptown they call it it's a great little place all the people
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:08.760]  virtually and I say all all of the people are in it with each other every shop
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:15.200]  owning here every restaurant everyone wants to see everyone doing well we have
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:21.760]  farmers markets we're all trying to help each other that's where it begins and we
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.600]  have to break away from these chains I keep saying it begin with breaking the
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.400]  chains and like I say if you think Olive Gardens Italian food you're out of
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:39.120]  your mind go to your local place I won't go to a Dunkin Donuts I go to Hudson
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:45.880]  Valley coffee shop I won't go and buy anything I don't have to buy in a chain
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.120]  store that I could buy locally that doesn't mean I don't buy everything I
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.360]  have to buy some things and the other thing most importantly it's about
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.000]  getting in touch with yourself you know I have this line that I use I'm alone in
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.040]  this row I was married for 23 years I have no children I'm divorced a long
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.800]  time too everybody I love is dead no big deal is that you just look at life
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:15.600]  differently and for me again only speaking for myself to me hell is taking
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.200]  that last breath of life and knowing that you BS yourself and you weren't the
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.960]  person you claimed to be so what I suggest is that everyone look at
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:32.000]  themselves and saying is this the way you want to trip out of here are you okay
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.720]  with yourself if not what can you do to leave this planet on a happy note a
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:46.160]  satisfied note and a note of of respect and dignity for yourself and I believe
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.000]  when more people do that they won't take the crap from these stupid politicians
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.560]  and a bunch of suck-up bureaucrats and other psychopaths and sociopaths they'll
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.360]  demand greatness for thousands of years silver has been used as both a medicine

[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.240]  you the head ones I had some of the others apologize for it but the last day
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.640]  we're trying to walk down a side street on the sidewalk across a little road
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.920]  it's not marked you can't walk across it because it's a red curb if you can't
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.760]  and we're trying to walk across it and the cops come and block it and say we're
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.520]  gonna arrest you if you walk across there and I sat there and I said if I said
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.280]  you go ahead and arrest us then this is going on for about 10 minutes and the
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.000]  national media was there the Guardian wrote about this and I said do you want
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.560]  your kids growing up in a country where where citizens can't walk across this
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.320]  entrance here to the Marriott on the side street you know this isn't marked and
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.080]  I said it's not illegal for me to walk right across here and go over by the
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.800]  hotel you know on on the city sidewalk I said can I walk and I said if you do
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.760]  this you'll you'll enforce anything that's illegal and I said do you want
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.880]  your children to live like this in this country and he pointed across the street
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.640]  and he said you see that mobile unit my boss is watching me on a camera right
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.840]  now and I'll get in trouble and I said so you're gonna follow orders you'll do
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.520]  anything to follow orders and he said no no fine fine go ahead you guys can walk
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.800]  across the street and everybody cheered and I turned back and I said that's what
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.800]  we have to fight for in America is that we can walk on the sidewalk past you know
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.000]  over an entrance where you're supposed to be able to walk and again it's not
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.360]  like people were even coming in and out of that entrance it's that that's how
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.320]  far we've come and the Guardian wrote about a victory for liberty that we could
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.800]  walk across the street and it just shows how ridiculous this is that we're in
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.800]  that people that work for the system are enforcing their own enslavement people
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.720]  have got to just start saying we're not gonna be part of this and start saying
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.760]  no exactly no it's what I said earlier when you see an economy in decline like
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.920]  ours and you see all the numbers coming out they just came out with some new
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:24.360]  data that hardly made the news about how many young people born in poverty never
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:29.120]  make it out and we're at the bottom of the list of all of the of the so-called
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.320]  developed nations pull dr. Paul Craig Roberts did a did a piece recently he's
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.920]  showing that no our median income isn't below 1989 levels it's been no low
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:46.320]  1967 levels the gap between the rich and the poor is the widest in the United
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.480]  States they're not even industrialized nations half the people in this country
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:57.120]  dying with no money in the bank this is the behavior the police in third world
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.280]  and declining nations like when you saw what was going on in Egypt and how much
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:08.320]  they hate to police that's what happens in declining societies they hate to
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.320]  police they'll arrest a two-year-old give a two-year-old kids parents a
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:19.600]  citation come on for the kid peeing you're gonna waste your time but John
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:27.600]  the Slime Corzine who rob segregated accounts like mine of 1.6 billion
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.720]  dollars that hey man I can't find it and how do you a little while ago oh and by
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:38.080]  the way the Attorney General yeah the Attorney General who Obama's Attorney
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.520]  General has not brought one Wall Street head to roll the same firm that I
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.120]  mentioned the white shoe firm he used to work for one of the white the premier
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.920]  white shoe boys shirt firms that is the premier one of the premier white collar
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:02.080]  crime criminal opera lawyer groups they also represent MF global oh yes the one
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:08.880]  that John Corzine also you know the heads of the different SCC's and things
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.320]  they were all work for Goldman Sachs were directly under Corzine I mean this is a
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.600]  criminal group and I guess they're gonna take it all the way to the wall I
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:20.640]  notice now they're starting little private cities for themselves where where
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.080]  we're all chased by drones and combat troops and and her slaves and they're
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.080]  all back to the castles I mean they're going back to the castles yeah that's
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.960]  what's going on and and again the whole game is rigged you don't have a shot at
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.120]  making it straight you know by the way when you get you're gonna start seeing
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.760]  crime really really start to escalate they say that the fish rots in the head
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:46.360]  down and everybody out there sees what's going on and we're just riffing now
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.600]  about Corzine and all these other guys that get off with no time and all their
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.440]  money so everybody else sees it they say hey if they're doing it why shouldn't
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.560]  I that's the way of the world you have to be a sucker to play it straight so now
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:07.320]  what you're seeing again when you add up all the data as I as you well know what
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:13.440]  is it now 20% of the of the children are living in poverty how many of them are
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:19.120]  going to get out very few they come from nothing they have nothing and they'll do
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.080]  anything to get something so you can see how this whole cycle of violence and
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.080]  crime keeps building on itself which is legalized slavery because they get the
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:33.000]  kids for petty things or even being late to class put them in juvenile hall they
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.560]  get beat up they get inducted into a gang now now they get an education in
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.400]  crime or they become cops and the cycle continues it's legalized slavery I got
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.800]  two final points I want to plug the journal here because it's so invaluable
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.680]  for folks out there but guns of pot users to be confiscated federal court rule
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.960]  they can do asset for which are seizure for any substance abuse including
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:02.160]  prescription drugs alcohol or marijuana so now the ATF will decide if you're a
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.160]  substance abuser no judge no jury no 68 gun control act you're not a felon and
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:16.480]  take your guns so now the pot users are gonna have their guns taken and I mean
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:24.080]  the magnitude of of all of this just absolutely makes your head spin when you
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.520]  realize that that they are just trying to bring us to a road warrior level
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.320]  society Obama said he'd get our guns one way or another I mean when is the what's
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.440]  your take on that well the take is very simple we were talking we began this by
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.880]  talking about the economy I mentioned about how young people have no
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:51.080]  reference point when they're when they used to be small farms small businesses
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.720]  small agriculture when the bit when there were a lot of people that were in
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.400]  the communications business and it wasn't all closed up it's a takeover we're
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.600]  talking about the central banks in Europe tying in with the central banks in
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.480]  the United States oh and by the way that European Supreme Court ruling again
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.560]  with those cats in the red hats and those little red robes they also took
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:18.040]  power out of the Bundestag the German government and transferred it into
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.560]  Brussels so now you're going to have two major central banks working with each
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.160]  other the Brussels central banks and you you mentioned Brasso before about how
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.120]  they're going to start taking all the power away from the European nations and
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:36.960]  centralizing it so what it is what it all adds up to and what we're only
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:44.560]  talking now about the details Alex of fascism the merger of corporate and
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:53.240]  state powers it's been a takeover the corporations run the game it was no
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:59.160]  such thing when I was a young guy of hedge funds and private equity groups
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:04.120]  owning corporations they put their people in every government you look at
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:09.160]  Brazil you look at African countries New Zealand it's always Goldman Sachs
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.760]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan they've got the regulators they got the judges I mean
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.960]  it's now I've never seen I've studied history deeply in modern history such a
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:25.120]  massive unification of crooks who are just literally running the police and
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.680]  everything else God help us Gerald Salente we've got to help ourselves God
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.120]  helps those that help themselves as we know trust in God but we're away from
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.080]  the rocks the better one saying you know trust in God to tie up your camel I
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.560]  mean I guess you know Hunter s Thompson kind of ripped off that and said is
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:45.080]  trusting God we pray to God we're away from the rocks people need to support
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.920]  prisonplanet.tv they need to subscribe they need to share their username and
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.720]  passcode with up to six people they need to spread the word by word of mouth
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.000]  because information and awareness and resistance can stop this and they need to
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.120]  support the organic farms and the and the and the small shops and I go to second
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.280]  hand shops for clothes you can find even better stuff for nothing because it's it
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.600]  is about the quality but like getting back to you the Trends Journal world
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.680]  class I mean I can't learn much from you know quite a few people but I learned
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.160]  something eagerly from that when you're nice enough to send us the PDF of it
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.600]  even before the physical magazine comes out the weekly alerts all of it at
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:31.000]  TrendsJournal.com tell people you never plug yourself how they can subscribe how
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.600]  they can sign up and even if they can hear you here for free coming on once a
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:40.280]  month or something hey support somebody because look it turns out $500
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.480]  million and I already knew this but it was down the news of stimulus money went
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:49.480]  to MSNBC to push their anti-freedom crap to not hire anybody but to give
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:55.240]  bonuses to all those propagandists they also got another half billion a few
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:00.280]  years ago in the bailout of the companies that own NBC I mean it's so
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.600]  classic these are literally paid mercenary mouthpieces in mainstream media
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.240]  you and I in our operations we don't have that and and so people need to
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.280]  understand if they're watching out there on the internet you need to support
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:19.200]  this information yeah the more people that support people like you myself and
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.720]  others that are putting out the word the greater the chances are that we're
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.200]  going to move into a more positive future if they keep putting their money
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.600]  in with the people that are raping them guess what they're gonna continue to get
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.440]  raped so the more that comes in the more we can put out it's as simple as that
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.360]  and with the TrendsJournal which our website is TrendsJournal.com you know

[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:29.520]  since like 32 years and our track record is second to none and we're very
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:37.040]  fearful of what's going to go on in the future and we need you to help us make a
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.000]  better future and a better present by the way I hate these politicians to say

[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:51.480]  well know who's the four who the first people like they they they they eliminate
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.640]  the intellectuals the people that is showing what's going on they hate us
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:59.080]  because we're exposing the fraud and as I said you know when you talking about
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.320]  their evil their evil to me man they're members of the anti-human race there's a
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.680]  big galaxy out there look up into the sky I don't know where these cats are
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.640]  coming from but boy they don't have the hardest soul or anybody that I know you
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.600]  know I watched I watched all of the both conventions I have to because of my job
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:24.320]  and I could not believe this show that they put on one lie after another every
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:29.760]  cheap applause line you could believe and and then I have to tell you you know
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:37.000]  they put on a great show it's part it's part Super Bowl half-time and mega
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.360]  church revival meeting and and the sheep will buy it and so when you see the
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:49.600]  level of manipulation and weigh that against the emptiness of what they say
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.360]  and all of the broken promises what do people expect these no one would
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.000]  associate with these kind of people in business or in life or in relationships
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.880]  yet we're handing over our lives to them so yes you know yeah we need the
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:11.840]  more again the more that we get the more that we could give I know how much you
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:18.840]  give I know how much you're out there I know I don't know how much how hard you
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.480]  work but I only could imagine because I know how what I have to do to stay you
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:29.920]  know on top of the news and ahead of the trends it's non-stop so the more
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.600]  people that help us the more it helps everybody well and I think we're getting
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.760]  down to it is we're all in this together I mean I'll go back ten years ago
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.840]  sitting there watching the globalist engage and divide and conquer and at some
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.320]  levels you know not that even dislike people but they're taught to dislike
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.800]  use you go well find out it's like you do I had a very deep level understand now
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.520]  that that is the enemy completely because that's how the globalist win
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:03.120]  humanity is in this together the ruling elite are scientifically playing us off
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.240]  against each other they're cold-blooded they are malfunctioning they're screwed
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.280]  up people you're right they're not on team humanity no they're anti-human
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:17.640]  they're the anti-human race oh and one more thing turn on any TV station go to
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:25.360]  any cable station you want where do you see the news like you deliver the news
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:32.600]  on your TV show nowhere no place know how well Gerald Salente I think this was
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:36.160]  the most powerful talk we've ever had and I think that's because we are now
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.520]  coming down to the line over in the Middle East Africa Latin America Asia
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.720]  that they're already dying by the millions of starvation every year 15
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.880]  million a year adults about 15 million children 30 million they're already
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.920]  being bombed by drones they're already being you know Western governments
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.760]  funding the next group to attack them they're already living in huts with
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.760]  mosquitoes biting them all day they're already watching their kids starve to
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.080]  death and I I just feel sorry for all the dumb yuppies out there because you
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.080]  have no idea what you're getting ready to face if this goes all the way
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.000]  Gerald Salente final comment well yeah you really said it because you know when
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.560]  you're seeing what's going on over there it's going to happen here you don't
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.640]  have to have a stretch of the imagination to figure it out you as we're
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:21.680]  talking anybody could do go on the computer and and do your own homework
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:27.280]  and add up the embassies that are being attacked add up the ones that are being
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:35.360]  burned add up all of the violence going on it's going to happen here as I said
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:43.720]  and when it does false flag or real bam the ham is gonna come down the gates
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:50.440]  are going to go up and freedom is going to be lost it's going to be end of the
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:56.480]  United States of America it's happening in front of us this is not a stretch of
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.480]  the imagination we saw what happened with 9-11 we get a couple of more like
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:10.520]  that even smaller the clamps come on the curtain goes down and it's going to be

[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:09.960]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:20.160]  this is the info wars nightly news I'm Aaron Dykes and I'm Melissa Mountain
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:25.320]  agenda 21 is not a conspiracy theory and while it may seem harmless or even
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:30.480]  helpful on the surface it is a UN inspired banker funded scheme to institute
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.560]  a global government from the ground up right here right now our country is
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.840]  being taken over in the name of sustainable development local
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:42.480]  environmental groups are meeting in towns across America backed by big federal
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:47.160]  grant money but behind that entities like the Rockefeller Foundation their
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.600]  sustainable community meetings are not only a takeover but a buy-in to a plant
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.600]  society controlled by a psychopathic elite all sold with a smile so to find
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.040]  out more we decided to investigate some of those local meetings taking place in
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:07.400]  Texas to find out about the dark deception behind this agenda 21 scheme
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:12.760]  they had growth on them so quickly and so heavily they didn't have time to play
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:18.560]  what is sustainable development conservation of energy resources people
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.440]  that live there maybe don't have to drive concentrated and balanced growth
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.840]  concentrated and balanced growth and the kind of growth you want to see to help you achieve
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:31.440]  the vision higher density mixed use development the center of town how
[01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:37.880]  compact or not is it creating this much more interconnected grid housing and
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:42.000]  jobs balance with the stakeholder committee's participation in line with
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.760]  the sustainable places project the housing and urban development department
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.480]  of the United States awarded sustainable communities regional planning grants to
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:57.080]  Texas giving 3.7 million dollars to the Capital Area Council of Governments in
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:02.200]  a project that span Austin Texas as well as neighboring rural communities that
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:07.560]  include Elgin Lockhart Hutto and Dripping Springs the grant specifies
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:12.440]  guidelines for energy use and climate change mitigation as well as the
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:18.280]  integration of smart housing nearby job sectors and integrated transportation
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:22.720]  systems the members of the project we spoke with an Elgin were apparently
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:31.880]  unaware of HUD's related agenda to the larger agenda 21 program what's the
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:37.600]  number stand for 21st century and what does that mean you can look it up on the
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.680]  internet I'm not familiar with it also I couldn't comment on that I'm not sure
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.480]  what the criteria of the outline is
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.680]  respectfully there is no national treaty that obligates local governments of
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.960]  college in 21 that just doesn't exist that's a myth we're promoting sustainable
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.240]  responsible development but it's nothing to do with the United Nations
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:05.840]  if that's just paranoia sorry in fact there is an international agenda at
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.440]  work Austin is a model city for the ICLEI the NGO partnered with the United
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:17.160]  Nations to push for local agenda 21 implementation in the name of
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:21.640]  sustainability they've taken on some of the most ambitious carbon cuts in the
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.160]  entire nation and are a model for energy conservation and zero waste an
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.000]  unelected regional boards are drawing the rest of central Texas into this
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.400]  international scheme all in the name of sustainability among other groups
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:43.680]  smart growth America and the ICLEI local governments for sustainability USA group
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.800]  specifically congratulated the cities and towns receiving these HUD grants for
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.240]  sustainable communities and regional planning so it is absurd to claim that
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:57.360]  there is no international agenda interacting with these local communities
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.000]  as they attempt to implement sustainable development goals well I know a lot
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.360]  about to agenda 21 and I don't have any concerns because I don't think this I don't
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.920]  think this project is driven by the international community or even by the
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.080]  national community I think it's driven by all in Texas except it's been
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.240]  implemented nationally under treaty and these grants are coming from the
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.560]  federal level I think it's really dishonest not to admit there's an agenda
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.760]  21 motive sustainability is just about letting local communities decide for
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:31.400]  themselves we had heard so much about what agenda 21 wasn't we decided to
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:36.520]  interview a professor that teaches it this is Dean Almie an associate professor
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.280]  and director of graduate programs in urban design and landscape architecture
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:46.640]  at the University of Texas now in Texas Texas triangle is one of the ten
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:52.760]  identified mega regions of the United States and the projections which were
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.720]  pretty much just confirmed by the recent census data that was released are
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.200]  that populations in the Texas triangle will double in the next 20 to 30 years
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.700]  and one of the big problems of course is that it starts to create new towns new
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.320]  communities but are they really communities are they really towns when
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.520]  they're all sort of evolving in a really short time he teaches agenda 21
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:22.880]  courses at the University so the course I teach which I call agenda 21 really
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.720]  deals with the question of sustainable urbanism how do we begin to sort of
[01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.880]  build the city more sustainably moving forward what is agenda 21 kind of a
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.760]  brief overview and why you feel that it's an important plan well it was a
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:46.280]  resolution of the United Nations where a number of countries to get got together
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:55.640]  essentially in Rio also called the Rio declaration to begin to look at the way
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:02.320]  in which humans were occupying the world the state of the world the state of
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.800]  civilization in the world how we were using resources whether the consumption
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:16.680]  of resources and global development was being achieved ecologically and equitably
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.640]  and when recently asked about the UN's plan by a San Antonio based news station
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:26.120]  he was quoted as saying it's changing the status quo of how we operate as a
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.640]  country that is developing and so it's threatening to some people urban design
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:34.600]  by its nature is about the collective good and isn't necessarily about the
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:40.480]  freedom of anyone person to do whatever the hell they want you wanted to talk
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.400]  about that quote a little bit well I mean already you know if we're looking
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.320]  for code words okay so already in that quote is the term collective which you
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.640]  know a conspiracy theorist could could somehow associate with you know I don't
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:01.040]  know the Soviet Union right and that's not that's not the intent you know
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:08.000]  collective just means to get us together as a society so yeah I kind of stand
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.840]  behind that actually cities are not individual constructs built by single
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:18.120]  people cities are collective constructs where we all live together and we have
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:22.920]  to balance the needs of individuals and the needs of collective society and
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:30.920]  cities by their very nature would be very difficult to construct and manage
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:40.720]  and develop if they were all sort of politically anarchic agenda 21 sustainable
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:45.480]  development visioning meetings rely on the Delphi technique a manipulation
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:50.000]  tactic wherein a facilitator ensures a public forum goes as planned with the
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.640]  predetermined outcome already decided upon by those who ultimately called the
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.560]  meeting the Delphi technique was created by the Rand Corporation in the 1950s
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.760]  for the US Department of Defense to use as a psychological weapon during the
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.880]  Cold War while community feedback is encouraged the final outcome is driven
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:13.320]  by leading questions and preset answers notice in this presentation how your
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:18.480]  participation automatically equals acceptance these same exact strategies
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.840]  were outlined in detail in the local agenda 21 handbook we saw this at both
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.760]  sustainable development meetings we attended no matter what answer a
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:33.640]  community member chose it all fed into the agenda 21 plan already underway the
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:37.160]  project planners admitted they weren't working with a blank slate but were
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:41.960]  instead following a plan already mapped out by so-called stakeholders what we
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.720]  want to be really clear about is that we're not starting from sort of an
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:52.200]  empty slate your your community has done a lot of work in setting in place lots of
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:59.040]  plans and policies we're planners we've been involved in projects mostly in
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:06.400]  central Austin and around that area we worked on the Miller redevelopment for
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:12.000]  many years we're still working on it the downtown Austin plan we're working on
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.880]  several master plan communities around the region a lot of focus on urban infill
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:31.360]  redevelopment the reason I ask is because you use a lot of the same
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.840]  terminology visioning workshops and sustainable development and a lot of
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.440]  that falls under that plan and I just well that's that is very traditional
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:45.840]  planning talk from the last probably 30 years so we always talk about you know
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.840]  having a vision what is the general big picture vision but there's a larger
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:53.840]  agenda going on I mean this is a regional development it didn't start here
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.600]  in Elgin these proposals didn't originate here in Elgin they're being done in
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.840]  other cities I think these proposals did originally here in Elgin
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:06.840]  I really plan to bring it up all at once at the same exact time all over the country all over the city though
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.680]  because it's not a coordinated effort well I don't want to be contentious with you I would
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:16.800]  just say that I think that's a myth it just they're not spring up all over the
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:20.280]  country in this whole region there's four cities looking at it in fact these
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:25.160]  sustainable communities were popping up in nearly every major metro area across
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.320]  the country all funded by HUD and these sustainable communities are pursuing the
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:35.000]  international agenda under President Obama's partnership for sustainable
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.040]  communities joining together the policies and regulations of housing and
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:45.040]  urban development the Department of Traffic and the EPA I actually went to
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:49.480]  my first sustainable development meeting last week they received a federal
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:53.920]  grant from Obama's partnership for sustainable communities and they seem
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.560]  to use a lot of the same language in agenda 21 I didn't know if you knew
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.800]  about those sustainable meetings that have been happening around here and if
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:07.960]  those are somehow connected well there are a number of layers of
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.680]  sustainability I mean almost to the point where the term itself is sort of
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.360]  overused but here at the School of Architecture we have a Center for
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:23.480]  Sustainable Development which does get grants from foundations sometimes from
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:30.160]  federal government usually from philanthropic foundations and they
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:35.200]  because they are a clearinghouse for a whole series of different initiatives
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.320]  Texas has been faced with so-called smart growth proposals for well over a
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:45.680]  decade now for years bureaucrats in the Texas area laughed in the faces of
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.280]  activists even as they gave passionate speeches to find the implementation of
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:54.720]  toll roads and other unnecessary infrastructure already owned by the
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.760]  state of Texas and its citizens instead unelected regional boards like
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.240]  Campo move the measures forward as best they could while insiders who amounted
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:10.320]  to little more than thieves skimmed off the top and made millions off of secret
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:15.480]  deals and yet we see some of the same regional players pushing for further
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:20.240]  development in the name of sustainability the central Texas vision for
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:25.680]  growth was directed by Capcom trust for public land and envision central Texas
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.400]  these entities in turn are shaped and steered by countless environmental
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.520]  groups controlled and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation the Ford
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:40.240]  Foundation George Soros and Ted Turner among others their alignment with agenda
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.880]  21 is well documented sustainable development was coined by the United
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:50.240]  Nations to mask the covert takeover at the local level land conservation and
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.240]  smart growth planning have been used to subsidize insiders allowing development
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.560]  to be hijacked while the system picks winners and losers reaping the profits
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.920]  at our expense everything in green is the protected area so you see there's not
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.560]  really much protected areas 15 years ago two years ago this is the work that we
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:16.760]  did all this land was purchased by cities or by the city of Austin or the
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.880]  county and we use our funds and our political clout to encourage the city
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:29.800]  to purchase these lands for protection has any of that been developed on yes so
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.280]  the so this does not mean there is no development what it means is that the
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.960]  development is done in a sustainable and ecologically friendly way by implementing
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.440]  agenda 21 it's a local implementation it's from the bottom up kind of thing
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.480]  that by putting all these regulations environmentally and putting them on the
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:54.200]  urban areas that you know are usually the economic centers for cities that
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:57.520]  you're sort of picking winners and losers in a way because you're saying
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.760]  that only people who will adhere to these things are allowed to develop and so
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.960]  there's kind of a bigger agenda there with that I don't know what your thoughts
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:12.680]  are on that I would turn it around a little bit and I would say I don't know
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.640]  that we're picking winners or losers this is not a kind of environmental
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:22.080]  nepotism that's going on I mean but I think it's a mistake to think that
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:26.560]  rules don't already exist everywhere United Nations has made its anti-private
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:31.520]  property stands abundantly clear quote land cannot be treated as an ordinary
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:35.880]  asset controlled by individuals private land ownership is also a principal
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:38.960]  instrument of accumulation and concentration of wealth and therefore
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.720]  contributes to social injustice a provision of decent dwellings and
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.080]  healthy conditions for the people can only be achieved if land is used in the
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:52.320]  interest of society as a whole first of all we have to believe that humans
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:56.760]  need to live kind of symbiotically with the earth that we're not here to
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.360]  dominate here you know when the United States was founded and many of the
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.240]  original sort of authors and thinkers who wrote about you know society in the
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:12.720]  US and people like Thoreau for example there was a sort of idea that the US
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.280]  was this great wilderness that we could just go out and sort of settle the
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:22.560]  wilderness and be pioneers and live on our own and be independent and I don't
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.800]  think it's like that anymore I mean there's very little wilderness left in
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.600]  the United States sustainable development is the philosophy designed to
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.040]  bring human beings across the globe under the full control of a narrow human
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:43.200]  elite it's a 40 chapter document to basically control the world it's based
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:48.360]  entirely on socialist control mechanisms sustainable developers have
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:53.560]  designed a global movement coordinated through a global to local action plan to
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:58.400]  create world government in accordance with certain objectives an end to
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:04.560]  national sovereignty the abolition of private property the restructure of the
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:09.360]  family unit and increasing limitations and restrictions on mobility and
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.600]  individual opportunity professor Ami admitted plans to restrict travel were
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:18.600]  ecologically necessary and his contempt for the family and western
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.760]  civilization was thinly veiled you know the suburbs bring with them their own
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:30.600]  kind of tyranny right one is public space is almost non-existent in terms of
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.920]  real public space there's lots of the lawn right but real collective public
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:44.240]  space there's the tyranny I would argue of you know the nuclear family and not
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:49.400]  that that's tyranny in itself it's not but the wife having to drive their kids
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:53.680]  to every sip everything having to drop your kids off at school having to pick
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:56.760]  your kids up at school having to drive them to little league having to
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:02.760]  everything is about one member of a family having to basically play a
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:09.080]  support role while another member works and everything is sort of geared that
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:15.000]  way and it's actually quite expensive so things like the automobile and the
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.960]  amount of infrastructure that families used to economically to support living
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:27.640]  in an environment dominated by patterns that are automobile dependent is a big
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:34.560]  problem this is a jenna 21 map that claims that that is what if it didn't
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.600]  21 was fully implemented the United States would look like I don't know
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.960]  if you've ever seen this map before and this is something that opponents have
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.120]  said is the ultimate plan of a jenna 21 I didn't know if you had heard of this
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:55.520]  map or seen it before I haven't seen the map before but I know where some of the
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:01.880]  principles behind the map come from it's trying to kind of suggest that if we
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:10.000]  were to develop networks networks of water networks of plant habitat networks
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.720]  of animal habitat networks of human habitat how would these networks begin
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:19.160]  to interact what areas would need to be preserved from development there is a
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:26.280]  pretty great fear of this I found a lot out there you bet this plan it really
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:31.400]  will somehow in property rights people's personal property rights that it will in
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.520]  national sovereignty eventually and give it up to a whole global entity now that
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:40.400]  will kind of take control over everything that's kind of the general you
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:46.640]  know you know what will end national sovereignty faster than some fictitious
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:55.480]  conspiracy based on a United Nations declaration major ecological catastrophe
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:05.320]  you know and and you know to be honest in my opinion I think one has to come to
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:10.040]  terms with the fact that such things as global warming exists if you don't
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:14.480]  believe global warming exists or if you believe that man is on this planet to
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:20.520]  dominate the world then you don't care about these things it should be noted
[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:24.020]  that the professor admitted to democratic socialist leanings once the
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:28.440]  cameras were off and that his father worked for the CIA as evidenced by a
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:33.000]  paperweight he displayed on his desk during the interview while he talked in
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.280]  circles on many concepts and seemed to contend that he knew what was best for
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:42.840]  humanity he refused to acknowledge any nefarious motives behind agenda 21 most
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:48.160]  of the people here in Elgin don't know or care what agenda 21 is I don't care
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:52.880]  what agenda 21's agenda is think about it these local planners are trying to
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:58.120]  concentrate smart growth in small towns of barely 15,000 people in the second
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:03.240]  largest state in the nation encompassing hundreds of miles of empty land in fact
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:06.880]  experts have even come forward to say that the world's entire population of
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.000]  7 billion could fit here in Texas comfortably with no problem it doesn't
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:15.200]  make any sense but make no mistake what does make sense is that these local
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.360]  sustainable development meetings are nothing more than a green mask trying
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:24.000]  to hide a global takeover in plain sight takeover doesn't even begin to explain
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.840]  it there really are no words for this level of evil and greed these are just
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:32.480]  front groups we've analyzed in the video today but when you look at the real
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:37.000]  players behind them the bankers the people with connections to families like
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.120]  the Rockefellers you begin to understand the true corruption the real nature of
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:47.720]  evil where mega wealth aligns with an agenda to destroy humanity and control
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:52.520]  our future for their gain for the info wars nightly news I'm Aaron Dykes and I'm
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:54:04.000]  Melissa Melton I'm Melissa Melton reporting for info wars.com as agenda 21
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.160]  the United Nations plan to take control of the world from the local level up
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.560]  grows across America under the guise of the green movement our national
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:14.520]  sovereignty our personal freedom and our very way of life is under attack what
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.560]  is the what is it 21 for new listeners why is it important and what are the new
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:22.840]  big developments I mean is it safe to say the battle is joined right now Rosa
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:27.840]  for people who don't know what agenda 21 is it's basically it's not what is
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:34.520]  agenda 21 it's almost what isn't it is the blueprint it is the action plan to
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:41.440]  inventory and control all land all water all plants all minerals all
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:47.560]  construction all animals all means of production all energy all information
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:54.320]  and all human beings in the world it is a completely comprehensive plan it's
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.160]  global and it's implemented locally. Agenda 21 highlights include the
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.720]  destruction of the family unit in the name of sustainable development with
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.280]  people being forced to live in tight compact cities and high-rise stack them
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:12.680]  and pack them apartments no bigger than this 16 by 16 foot space I decided to
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:16.920]  ask people what they thought about the UN's plan to get people on the grid so
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:21.880]  would you live in a house no bigger than the size of this square it feels like a
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:27.480]  jail cell a cell no way I mean it's impossible well you know it depends on
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:34.280]  what my options would be if this was the only option I I'm sure it would be
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:39.200]  living under a bridge you need one of these twice this size yeah three times
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:43.640]  this big really yeah I've lived in one about this size and it was like a been
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.960]  an animal in a box or something would you do it for the good of the earth yes
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:55.920]  I would have you ever heard of Agenda 21 I haven't no no no no no
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:59.520]  Gena 21's a plan we've been signed on to with the United Nations where we'd give
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.520]  up our property rights and freedom and be forced to live in apartments no bigger
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:06.600]  than this square what do you think about that I think that's terrible sounds kind
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:12.160]  of like Chinese before in policy or interior policy regarding their house
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.080]  and how they're controlling all aspects of your life I don't think it sounds
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.720]  fair this map entitled simulated reserve and corridor system to protect
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:27.320]  biodiversity illustrates how the UN's Agenda 21 plan would work in the United
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:32.720]  States under this takeover all personal property rights would cease to exist the
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:37.240]  red zones which make up the maps majority will be mandated for little to
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:43.360]  no human use the yellow zones are buffer zones for highly regulated use only in
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:48.800]  the scant green areas is any normal human use allowed the tiny black dots are
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:52.480]  the dense mega cities where transportation will be tightly controlled
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.000]  freedom will be restricted and people will be packed in like sardines living
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.120]  in tiny 275 square foot units amounting to little more than jail cells all in
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:09.320]  the name of saving the earth let's move right along now to agenda 21 micro
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:13.200]  apartment scheme being beta tested in New York City yeah they passed the law
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:20.680]  last year 2011 in Germany saying that all new homes by 2020 could not be single
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.520]  parent you've got to live in these big dormitories and now Bloomberg who wants
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.400]  to control what you eat what you do in ban your guns says these studios and one
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:33.160]  bedroom apartments they're like closets will be no bigger than 275 to 300
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:37.880]  square feet that's called a tiny supermax cell these tiny living spaces are
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:42.520]  smaller than currently allowed by building regulations and they say this
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:47.440]  is good for the earth see they can raise more taxes they'll charge you more for a
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:53.880]  200 square foot cell than for a thousand foot this is how this works more for
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:59.160]  less the eugenics agenda 21 post-industrial slave model they're
[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:02.680]  actually already beta testing these micro apartments in New York City and
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:06.840]  San Francisco have you heard of that I haven't I'm afraid not I think we need
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:12.720]  to support abandoning this idea well it's not gonna happen if they're dealing
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.840]  with humans because no one's gonna bow down and say yes we are living in this
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.960]  not everybody's going to do it but as agenda 21 creeps across the country more
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:26.560]  and more people will be forced to face it while sustainable development may
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:30.800]  sound like a beneficial idea is giving up all of our liberty in the name of the
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:35.240]  greater good really such a good idea I'm Melissa Melton reporting for Info Wars

[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:16.000]  professor's office at UT he's like do you see my UN sign or do you see my CIA
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:25.760]  sign I am connected to the CIA I am powerful basically and then you want to
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:31.560]  say I'm a democratic socialist yeah and he said on the video collectivism and
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:36.080]  you know we're gonna he's got quotes out there online in his in his different
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:40.720]  articles saying that well this isn't about the individual it's about the
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.480]  collective yes and the beam counting controlling guilds that are up there
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:48.720]  you're people that couldn't win in a free market people that couldn't win with
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.320]  a widget or a book or an idea or a film it's about you getting together with a
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:02:00.520]  gang taking over and telling us how we're gonna live our lives and you know
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:05.080]  what you can go straight to hell as far as I'm concerned you parasites have
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.480]  always tried to take over society and no matter how many computers and robots
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:13.680]  and spies and checkpoints you've got you're gonna fail you're always able to
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:18.040]  wreck societies and take over with your bloated control freakism but in the
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:23.440]  final equation you collapse and you will fail I'll quote Thomas Jefferson I have
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:29.080]  sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance over every form of tyranny
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.960]  every form of tyranny over the mind of men I will not sit here and put up with

[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:30.960]  money to Obama they own all the puppets the point is is that they are
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:34.240]  involved in a bureaucratic corporate takeover and they hope you're too busy
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:40.600]  watching TV and dancing with the stars and NFL to care and the choice is up to

[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:16.360]  points to deal with them then we go to these events or go to professors are
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:22.200]  like well that is agenda 21 by the UN but all it is is zoning and planning I

[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:10.400]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:14.600]  corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:18.400]  prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:22.440]  business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:26.640]  freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:30.840]  e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:34.680]  to raise prices to now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my

[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:17.440]  defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:44.480]  Alex Jones here to cover a topic an issue that is one of the most important
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:49.800]  I've ever discussed this information is very closely held by governments and
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:55.680]  elite corporations they do not want you understanding this now many of you that
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:00.480]  are already aware of this it'll seem simple but large swaths of the global
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:06.400]  population have no idea the real geopolitical paradigm that we're living
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:11.160]  in today today we'll look at the real forces the real players in the battle
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:16.240]  for 21st century global hegemony I'm gonna break down who really rules the
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:21.760]  world how they control the planet and how they are trying to usher in a world
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:27.120]  war that is really pointed at the general population to begin my
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:32.120]  illustration I have three different board games here chess the classic game of
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:37.520]  risk as well as monopoly we're gonna look at these systems of stylized
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:41.960]  warfare and between these three systems we find the truth of the system that
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.040]  we're living under how do we know that system well books written by people like
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.040]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown Bill Clinton's mentor they think we're
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.720]  stupid and so we have their own documents to begin with I'm going to use a
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:01.480]  Lego chess set as a illustration to break down primitive forms of
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.760]  government warfare and domination if you look at this set you notice there are
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:10.880]  two sides there is the red and there is the green or there is the black there
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:15.280]  is the white from the beginnings of civilization more than 6,000 years ago
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:23.240]  until about 1700 this was the model of warfare between nations there were
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.720]  occasional alliances but by and large warfare and politics was carried out in
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:34.680]  a very two-dimensional way like a chess set you have the ruling class the royalty
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:41.400]  the priest class the military elite the generals and in front of them you have
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:45.600]  basically their conscripts of the lower class fighters who can also represent
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.840]  just the general population and these two groups are engaged in warfare and
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:57.080]  base domination against each other to control larger areas of land and the
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:02.040]  vassal populations living in serfdom upon it one area that we see from the
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.520]  ancient chess model that is still used in statecraft by the globalist is the
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:12.440]  fact that sometimes wars were launched in the case of the French and the
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:18.280]  British against each other when they had rebellions at home they soon learned it
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:24.440]  was a way to turn inner anger at the state against a foreign state and to
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:29.640]  reduce the population of young males that you didn't have jobs for the two
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:37.000]  sided fight is a bygone era in truth for more than 300 years the globalist have
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.080]  been financing multiple sides of wars knowing that conflict destroys nations
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:48.200]  and gets countries deep into debt and that is the key they're financing both
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:53.400]  sides and we see this being pioneered by people like the Rothschilds starting in
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.160]  the 17 and 1800s where they would finance sometimes three or four different
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.920]  factions and it didn't matter who won because all of them were in debt to them
[02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:09.040]  and had societies that were wrecked after the wars next let's look at the game of
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:16.320]  risk these are primitive attempts to distill down human conflict and
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:22.200]  domination into a game you can play in a few hours the militaries all have
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:26.760]  basically equal resources equal numbers of troops and to enter into the equation
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:32.800]  some type of random probability we have dice and we have carts there is no
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:38.720]  discussion here on looking at the real model that we are under today we're
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:44.160]  going to come back to risk here in a moment but first let's move to the game
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:50.160]  of monopoly in the game of monopoly you have different economic groups are for
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:54.960]  players that attempt to engage in economic warfare against each other
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:01.400]  and then be able to create a monopoly or a single entity that is in control of
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:05.920]  New York City to understand the real system we're under it's important to
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:11.960]  combine monopoly and risk with an overlay of strategy from chess and this
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:16.320]  is a key part of the real system we live under today the founder of the
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:21.520]  Rockefeller dynasty famously said that competition was a sin and they wanted
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.400]  big governments that they financed in control to be able to shut down their
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:31.280]  competition and pick winners and losers this is the essence of monopoly
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:36.120]  capitalism the opposite of free market and it's simply a form of fascism what
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:42.240]  Mussolini called corporatism so out of these three board games monopoly best
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:47.080]  describes our modern system but in itself is only two-dimensional you see
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:51.320]  the private Federal Reserve that's owned by six private banks Goldman Sachs
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:57.560]  JPMorgan Bank of America and others they always win you're playing their game
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.520]  you think you're battling it out for houses and apartments and for park
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.600]  place and for the electric company and for the railroad and for the top ad and
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:11.000]  for the fashion show but it's the bankers that control the politicians
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:16.960]  they've got to get out of jail free card and they've got control of the money the
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:23.200]  Treasury works for them so the bank always wins but what happens if a
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:30.120]  country won't sell what happens if an African nation won't play the monopoly
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:35.400]  game or what happens if a Middle Eastern country doesn't want to be part of the
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:40.320]  modern Bankster system based in London and New York well then that's where risk
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:45.280]  comes in because they want to be able to take you over their economic espionage
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.200]  as John Perkins has written in his bestseller confessions of an economic
[02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:54.640]  hitman but if they can't this is in all the official CIA and State Department
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:01.520]  documents they will then come and finance your neighbor to attack you so
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:07.080]  Libby is not playing ball it's building up an industrializing all of Africa you
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:11.360]  want a global monopoly you just play countries off against each other you're
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:15.320]  a globalist you've made yourselves exempt with diplomatic immunity at the
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:19.680]  United Nations who set that up the robber barons what do you do you just
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:25.360]  have al-Qaeda come out of Egypt into Libya ethnically cleanse blow up most of
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:31.440]  the infrastructure knock out Qaddafi and now they have to come to you and borrow
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:37.920]  money out of your bank to rebuild and you own and control everything and guess
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:41.960]  what if you want to get that welfare check well you got to take the vaccines
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:46.600]  which by the way sterilize you so they're using the strategy of chess but
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:50.560]  they're employing it through a monopolistic system where they have a
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:55.200]  monopoly on the issuance of currency and credit and they also have the biggest
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:59.520]  militaries on earth from the United States in Europe controlled and
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:03.600]  dominated a hundred percent by them they've announced that we're totally
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:08.800]  their slaves and they have such disdain for us they use our supposed enemy
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:14.640]  al-Qaeda against the Russians against the Serbs and now against other Middle
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:20.400]  Eastern nations while simultaneously telling us we need military style
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:26.920]  occupation within our countries by the TSA and the military to keep us safe
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:33.640]  from al-Qaeda who they sponsored and created and remember the banksters are
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.960]  openly crowing and bragging that they have conquered you through monopoly
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.640]  capitalism the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I
[02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:48.440]  want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:52.880]  one world the central bankers in charge aren't we all just living and dying for
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:56.800]  what the central banks do to answer your question we are absolutely slaves to
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:00.440]  central banks and they weren't able to do this because they had better products
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:05.400]  they were able to do it because they created the fractional reserve banking
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:10.520]  here in the US and similar systems worldwide unlimited free credit for
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:16.640]  themselves which they then loan out to you at interest but that wasn't enough
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:20.960]  of a fraud for them in the last 20 years they've deployed derivatives
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:27.160]  completely made up counterfeit instruments to the tune of more than 1.5
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:35.240]  quadrillion that's 1,500 trillion with that counterfeit money they were able to
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:40.440]  buy up all of their competition pay off the governments and dominate defense
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:45.600]  industries as well as media to carry out their propaganda and herein lies the
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:49.840]  big secret that they don't want you to know the big secret hiding in plain
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:58.120]  view we think about nations and continents and cultures but in truth the
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:04.360]  globalist the bankers who have unlimited money they're waging war against anyone
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:09.040]  else that has any assets because they want everyone to be impoverished so you
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:14.200]  have to go to them and so that you have to follow all of their orders so they
[02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:19.280]  can control human development and society in the past they would brag about
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:23.880]  their real political system in fictional accounts in movies like network
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:30.640]  let's analyze a clip of that there is no America there is no democracy there is
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:42.760]  only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont Dow Union Carbide and Exxon one vast and
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:50.680]  ecumenical holding for whom all men will work to serve a common profit in which
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:56.480]  all men will hold a share of stock oh there are no more peoples there are no
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:01.800]  more nations mr. Beale each one of us has one piece of stock in the global
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:07.360]  system one ecumenical giant global government except one thing that big
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:11.800]  global corporate system they've been selling us on doesn't want us to even be
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:16.560]  alive it's designed to consolidate control and then slowly cut off the
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:21.920]  resources while the banksters themselves pose as the saviors selling people on
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:26.000]  getting deeper into the tyranny and the pain will stop when at the end of the
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.880]  tunnel is nothing but global extermination and eugenics so that
[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:34.600]  these selfish greedy scam artists can have the world and all of the
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:39.080]  incredible technology and life extension for themselves and that's the big

[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:19.880]  destroy truth by burning pages you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:25.640]  ugly misforned little creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:33.000]  being words mr. Wordsworth that have no substance and no dimension like air like
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:39.720]  the wind I don't care I tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I

[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:52.640]  illusions mr. Wordsworth the illusions that you inject into your veins to make
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:57.000]  you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:04.440]  but spittly limp to the green and mistake has no use for your crime resistance to
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:11.200]  tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:55.080]  while chance of president Paul have long been silenced the congressman
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:59.200]  supporters may still have an unexpected opportunity to get Ron Paul elected to
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:04.760]  high office that's because in 2014 the seat for Texas governor will be open
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:09.440]  while a spokesperson for the congressman has stated to info wars that the doctor
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:13.960]  is not interested in the position many activists can argue that a large-scale
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:19.600]  grassroots effort promoting this idea could prompt them to reconsider current
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.040]  Texas governor Rick Perry has stated he does intend to seek re-election despite
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:28.240]  the fact he has already held this position for 12 years and a recent Dallas
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:32.360]  morning news poll shows a majority of Texans don't think he should run again
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.840]  I recently asked visitors at the Texas Capitol building in Austin what they
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:40.400]  thought of this possibility do you think Ron Paul should run for governor of
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:46.400]  Texas yes why I think he's a good politician he gives the rights to the
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:49.040]  people not as much government interference which is something I'd
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:53.720]  prefer he's also very confident politician very experienced and I believe
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:59.200]  you do a great job do you think he has a shot of winning possibly if he gets his
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:03.440]  message out there and really conveys to the people that he is the best in
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:09.440]  interest in his mind is Texans I think you should yeah I mean it seems like a
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:14.560]  guy that might actually do a little bit better than Rick Perry he seems to be a
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:17.320]  little bit more caring for people and stuff like that and other men do you
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.160]  think Ron Paul would have a shot of winning a realistic shot of winning not
[02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:27.280]  really um do you think Ron Paul should run for governor of Texas no I don't I
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:31.800]  really don't why not I don't care for him too much I just don't care for his
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:35.280]  policies and some of the things he stands for do you think he could win if he
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:43.440]  ran um probably not it's it's it's hard to tell but I don't think so but a lot of
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:47.120]  people don't care for some of his issues but I mean some he has that are good but
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:51.120]  the underlying things I really don't care for I don't think so because he does
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:55.400]  really have any experience in governing do you think he could win if he ran for
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:28:02.440]  governor of Texas I don't think so why not he's not he's too too much of an
[02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.400]  individual and I'm not part of the machine you have to be part of the
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.320]  machine here in order to win if Ron Paul were to win the election he would be
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:15.280]  79 years old on election day while some may argue that his elder age would be
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:19.040]  viewed as a negative to his campaign it is important to note that he would have
[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:23.280]  been serving as a public servant at this age had he won the presidency
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:27.200]  advocates can also argue that a statewide campaign would be far less
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.760]  taxing on the congressman and his family than a national campaign and that he
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:37.840]  can choose to serve for just one term in a recent blog posted by former Paul
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:42.200]  spokesman Doug weed he states that he does not rule out the possibility that
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:46.520]  dr. Paul will run for public office again however he was referring to a
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:50.880]  presidential run a recent University of Texas Paul shows that most state
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:55.560]  residents are happy with the direction the state is currently going in the
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:59.040]  survey also shows that while the economy is the most important issue for
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.400]  most Americans illegal immigration and border security are the two most
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:08.560]  important issues for Texans residents I spoke to however would want dr. Paul to
[02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:12.320]  address another issue if he were to win you know I've been reading a few
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:17.640]  articles about people that are wrongly convicted and to me that's kind of
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:21.680]  disheartening because you know I don't know anybody personally that was in that
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:24.760]  situation but from hearing the stories and stuff like that you know kind of
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:29.600]  devastating family I'd like to see any governor or any candidate for governor
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:34.520]  address the death penalty and speak about abolishing it again it's very
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:39.480]  unjust always fighting on behalf of Liberty for Info Wars Nightly News I'm

[02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:33.840]  Thank you for joining us my friends as we enter the final stretch two more
[02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:37.440]  segments here. We've been airing some of the most important reports that we've
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:41.120]  done over the years but also some of the new reports we've been breaking and
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:47.080]  premiering here today dealing with the China 21 and UN tyranny the collective
[02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:51.760]  as socialist takeover of our society but I wanted to put out a report that we
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.960]  did over two years ago that's been watched millions and millions of times
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:01.480]  online and it's food the ultimate secret. You see there have been different
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.280]  groups of bureaucrats and ruling classes that figured out that humans have a
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:09.240]  limited lifespan and that well if you don't teach people the lessons of
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:16.640]  history early on you can enslave them but Americans especially tended to be
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:22.800]  pretty uppity and pretty aggressive and so we've been hard to domesticate and
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:27.640]  television did a pretty good job and pushing illegal drugs and legal drugs
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:31.240]  on us has helped as well to get us under their control but the biggest thing is
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:39.320]  food and water the aspartame the MSG the fluoride with an electron missing to
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:44.640]  make it even more toxic turning it into an acid the hundreds and hundreds of
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:47.960]  chemicals I mean I remember five years ago I heard on the radio driving along
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:56.160]  I think it was coast to coast AM in the news portion reporting that chicken
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:00.400]  McNuggets not just at McDonald's other companies had silicone in it I thought
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.560]  that can't be true so I got home and googled it now I start page it start
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:14.080]  page.com and there it was the admission that it was silicone and then I saw the
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.320]  Associated Press you can look this up when it came out that melamine plastic
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:20.320]  was causing organ failure and China they were executing people that were
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:24.440]  involved when it was found in our formula and things they said oh don't worry
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:29.560]  melamine's not bad for you people are dying from that so basically coming to
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:33.200]  the hospital and they don't check for what kills you if you were poisoned by
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:37.000]  some big company or some product they just let you die and just call it
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.040]  something else so this is a big deal and they think you're stupid they think
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:44.440]  they can poison you and you won't notice or resist I hope that you will
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:47.840]  investigate and find out this holocaust is going on here it is through the
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:50.480]  ultimate secret
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:08.800]  my friends the information that you are about to witness from all of my years of
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:15.880]  research is the most important it's been hidden in plain view the entire time
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:23.200]  this is the ultimate secret and it's about to be exposed
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:32.080]  I have hundreds of government documents textbooks white papers where for over
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:37.560]  80 years the elite of the Western world have talked about adulterating food and
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:44.440]  water to sicken and sterilize the population for the purpose of eugenics
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.840]  it's all covered in the book eco science written by the White House
[02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:54.000]  science are John P. Holdren they talk about a planetary police state to carry
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.960]  out the for sterilization they also talk about covert systems in the water and
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:02.440]  food sterilize the population now this was written decades ago before he was
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:06.480]  White House science are now suddenly the stuff in this book is all over the news
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:12.600]  they're selling it to the public as if it's a good thing you see here before
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:17.360]  you what an average person would buy when they went shopping at the store not
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:23.120]  everything here is bad for you but much of it has compounds and artificial
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:27.960]  chemicals that have been added that are extremely toxic and bad for your health
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:33.680]  and they have known this the entire time and they have approved them for use
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:38.080]  let's start with aspartame
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:46.000]  you cannot go to the grocery store now and buy any type of even regular sugar
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:52.800]  gum that hasn't had aspartame added to it in the 1970s Searle tried to get it
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:56.400]  approved and they couldn't it took them three separate times because in their own
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:01.400]  studies with monkeys large portions of them that were fed it died and contracted
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:05.600]  cancer now we have mainstream news articles in the EU has done a major
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:11.920]  study finding lower birth weights early birth and yes miscarriages from women
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:18.640]  that drink aspartame laden soft drinks like coke zero what is aspartame it is
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:23.800]  the fecal matter of the E. Coli bacteria they took it and genetically engineered
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:28.720]  it they can feed it toxic waste and then it defecates aspartame and it has so
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:35.360]  many bad health effects it's just unspeakable this is being done by design
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:40.200]  it's also very very addictive but let's just go ahead and move away from
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:47.000]  aspartame and talk about McDonald's and chicken McNuggets now I remember a
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:52.200]  decade ago or so reading health advisories claiming that a form of plastic
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:57.520]  that's using silly putty basically a type of silicone was in the chicken
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:02.120]  McNuggets but also in many other TV dinners and other foods it is illegal
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.360]  in every other nation in the world to add these chemicals of the food but it's
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:11.240]  not in the United States the big secret is all of this was done by design by the
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:15.320]  FDA look at all the drugs they've approved and then it comes out later
[02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:19.000]  that they knowingly approve them when these drugs are causing heart attacks
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:30.080]  and cancer in the Nuremberg trials it came out that the Nazis were adding
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:34.840]  sodium fluoride to the water supply in the labor camps and death camps to make
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:39.080]  the population more docile and controllable there had been hundreds of
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:43.440]  university studies before Hitler even came to power this is a form of forced
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:48.680]  medication they admit that one part per million of sodium fluoride more than
[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:54.120]  doubles the chance of bone cancer in boys and men as the public became
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:39:57.760]  educated in the last few decades the government industry's response was to
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:01.800]  not just put it in water but to start adding it to thousands of products like
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:06.520]  children's water that's mixed with their formula or with their cereal they
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:12.480]  started adding as much as 900 parts per million in things like powdered eggs it
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:19.440]  causes reductions in IQ it increases sterility or lack of fertility and it's
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:25.600]  being added to so many of the daily staples that we consume we'll get back
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.160]  to food additives in a moment but first I wanted to look at genetically modified
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:32.720]  organisms
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:39.760]  did you know for many years the American people have been eating cloned beef and
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:44.680]  pork and now they're expanding out into other forms of meat let's look at salmon
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:50.600]  first major university studies conclusively have proven that the type
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.520]  of genetically modified salmon that is actually a cross species they've mixed
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:59.800]  other animal genes in with it that when this fish is introduced with wild
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:07.360]  natural salmon within 40 generations all the natural salmon are extinct and the
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:12.680]  FDA approve this and they're going to allow it to be released into the wild
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:20.560]  that isn't even a salmon it is a cross species chimera it is a mixture like
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:25.840]  something out of the island of dr. Maroo something out of the nightmare
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:34.680]  more than 85% of the corn now consumed in the United States and it's also
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:39.640]  starting to trend that way in Europe and Canada is genetically engineered it
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:46.120]  grows its own pesticide within the corn kernels so that insects won't eat it if
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:50.280]  the insects can't eat this and live what do you think's gonna happen when lab
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:56.480]  rats or humans eat it we have literally hundreds of studies showing that not just
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.280]  Monsanto's but other major GMO companies corn that's the majority of corn we're
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:06.520]  now eating the day in the United States has been linked to organ failure in lab
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:12.240]  animals the studies also show massive increases in sterility in rats and
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:19.040]  guinea pigs that are fed not just GMO corn but GMO cotton seeds studies in
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:24.440]  India Germany and the United States have conclusively shown that when they feed
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:28.960]  the cotton seeds left over from the cotton crop from these genetically
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:33.760]  modified varieties that the cows are having miscarriages they are having
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:38.640]  low birth weights or in many cases they're simply dying and what is in most
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:44.680]  processed foods genetically modified cotton seed oil major studies are also
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:49.000]  showing that genetically engineered crops are killing honey bees and monarch
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.160]  butterflies but they don't stop there now they claim they're coming out with a
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:55.680]  genetically engineered mosquito that's malaria proof that they're gonna release
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:01.320]  in the open biosphere the very genetic code of the planet is being butchered in
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:06.920]  a hostile corporate takeover many years ago an executive from Monsanto was
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.760]  quoted a National Geographic is saying that that is their program that they
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:15.960]  want to basically have their crops and their organisms take over the entire
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:20.640]  biosphere of this planet and the major genetic engineer companies have focused
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.560]  mainly on eight major food crops now they're expanding out into hundreds and
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:30.200]  hundreds of other plants literally changing the genetic code of the planet
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.200]  this is a genetic dictatorship this is genetic vandalism and that's why the
[02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:38.880]  Rockefellers the United Nations and others have built these giant armored
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:43.600]  seed vaults all over the world not just at the Arctic Circle and they admit
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:47.160]  they're doing it in case all of this gets out of hand that they'll have a type
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:50.840]  of Noah's Ark so all these fake environmental groups they never
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:54.680]  complain about this they never talk about true environmental degradation they
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:43:58.880]  want to put a tax on carbon dioxide that humans exhale that plants
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:03.680]  respirate from and carry out photosynthesis with as a way to shut
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.680]  down industrial society and control every facet of our lives that's the big
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.840]  secret this is a population reduction program
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:21.760]  it is an epidemic the sperm count has dropped in the Western world exponentially
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:25.400]  even the government has been predicting within another generation almost
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:30.200]  everyone is going to be sterile this is the globalist religion this is their
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:35.400]  philosophy they want the planet for themselves the UN has said that their
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:40.000]  stated plan is an 80% population reduction you've heard Ted Turner call
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.320]  us useless eaters and feeders and say that 80% of us need to be killed you've
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:47.800]  heard Prince Philip say he wants to come back as a virus to kill the majority of
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:52.180]  the world population Dr. Eric Pionka Peter Singer it's all over the news where
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:56.200]  they tell us that we should only have one child because more than one is bad
[02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:59.400]  for the environment and that the recession is good for lowering our
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:04.560]  carbon footprint this is the big secret we live in a scientific dictatorship and
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:08.520]  the United States and England are the epicenter of this and it's expanding
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:13.200]  worldwide remember all the secret testing all the secret sterilization that
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:16.880]  went on in the United States in Europe remember what Hitler did he learned all
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:21.000]  of that from the eugenicist and the Rockefeller family in the United States
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:26.640]  this is a culture of death being pushed on you and your family and even if you
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:30.000]  think the world is overpopulated you need to understand that you're being
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:39.280]  targeted by this as well targeted by design recombinant bovine growth
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:44.880]  hormone in your milk making eight-year-old girls go into puberty and
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:50.240]  they should be going into puberty at 12 or 13 silicone in chicken McNuggets and
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.160]  hundreds and hundreds of other processed foods aspartame that is the feces of
[02:45:55.160 --> 02:46:00.480]  genetically engineered bacteria that has incredible health problems that have
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:05.160]  been proven think for yourself it goes on and on ABC news this goes back four
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:11.760]  years ago viral meat spray advancing food safety they spray a live virus on the
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:17.120]  meat to supposedly kill the bacteria this is a live vaccine they spray on
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.800]  most the meat you're consuming that you're buying from the store it gets
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:25.480]  even worse the petroleum distillates or toxic waste that's left over from
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:30.120]  petroleum refineries that refine oil into gasoline they take these tens of
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:35.160]  millions of pounds of toxic waste that's left over the fluoride the mercury the
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:39.920]  lead and they dump it on crops as supposed fertilizer and what a crops
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:45.840]  like tomatoes and corn and potatoes do they pull in all of those toxins out of
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:49.760]  the ground in fact scientists for many years have used plants to actually
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.680]  detoxify areas that have been contaminated and those plants are
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:47:00.920]  pulling all of this up and then you are eating it that's why the Washington
[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:06.280]  Post reported in January of 2008 that a major study found that nearly a third of
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:11.440]  the 55 popular brand-name foods and beverage products were filled with
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:15.720]  mercury despite the fact of the people of Europe for over 20 years have fought
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.080]  off all the genetically modified wheat and corn and other crops being planted
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:25.080]  in their nation now the EU is buckled and is accepting it the United States is
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:29.360]  literally a testing ground for all of this it's just automatically approved
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:33.120]  and the people that work for these corporations they're compartmentalized
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:36.400]  they don't know what's going on the people that work at these stores they
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:40.680]  haven't no idea what's happening this is affecting all of us this is hurting
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:45.200]  everyone many different forms of cancer are growing by thousands of
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:50.720]  percentage points diabetes all these different diseases and in major studies
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.400]  it's all been linked to the toxic additives that are in our food our
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.360]  water and I haven't even had time to get into MSG I mean I've interviewed brain
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.280]  surgeons neurologists scientists I mean it just devastates the brain it's an
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.640]  excitotoxin it destroys the liver and it is in tens of thousands of products we
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:14.040]  can say no we can stand up but if you've got a neighbor given fluoride water to
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.000]  their baby please go over and warn them if you got a neighbor that's sitting there
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:22.960]  eating MSG filled chips one after the other warn them you've got a
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:27.200]  responsibility if you know people that are feeding processed foods filled with
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.400]  GMO warn them and for God's sakes don't give it to your own children if you want
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:36.480]  to kill yourself that's your own business but don't hurt your children
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:42.200]  don't do this ladies and gentlemen in closing I want to talk about some
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:47.640]  positive things just 15 years ago or so you couldn't find organic food anywhere
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:53.200]  on store shelves and now about half of what you see is organic just a few years
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:59.640]  ago all the milk had the growth hormone in it now it's hard to find milk that
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:04.640]  has the growth hormone in it because the consumers have spoken and said no a few
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:08.480]  years ago you couldn't find toothpaste it didn't have sodium fluoride in it now
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:12.840]  toms of Maine is starting to you know take over the aisle space and displace
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.360]  the other mainline toothpaste makers where it says on the back if you swallow
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:22.600]  this call poison control immediately even Colgate is now putting out fluoride
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:29.000]  free toothpaste people are demanding that they not be poisoned and they're
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.320]  finding out about what's going on and so industry is starting to respond and at
[02:49:33.320 --> 02:49:38.440]  least give people who want a choice an option to not be forcibly medicated
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:45.000]  through the food and the water you know cigarettes are bad for you but just 20
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.360]  years ago the cigarette makers were getting up before Congress and saying
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:52.080]  it was a conspiracy theory that it was killing people and then later it came
[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:55.600]  on their internal documents they knew it was deadly ladies and gentlemen I've
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:58.880]  seen the studies much of what they're putting in our food and water is far
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:02.360]  worse than even cigarettes as bad as they are one of the biggest killers in
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:07.200]  this country this is a covert soft kill operation we'll put a lot of links
[02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:11.000]  beneath this video so you can check out the facts for yourself and I'm just
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:14.480]  begging you to do your own research and find out that one of the most dangerous
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:41.800]  places in the world is your grocery store and the tap water in your house

[02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:06.280]  continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:10.800]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:15.400]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:18.600]  cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:22.640]  blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:26.560]  your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:30.760]  e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have
[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:34.600]  to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:37.880]  supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know

[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:13.440]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones the ultimate secret
[02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:17.120]  revealed now a lot of you already know this information but we've presented it
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:23.000]  with the documents with the mainstream news articles with images of what is in
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.360]  these different foods and what's being put in your water and we show images of
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:32.560]  the large packages of fluoride that says deadly poison on it that's being put
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:36.920]  in your water supply everyone needs to see this because the general public is
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:41.920]  not aware of just how serious this is it's not just that oh junk foods bad for
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:47.680]  you or too much fluoride is bad for you this is being put in there by design we
[02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:51.480]  have the government white papers and corporate and university and UN
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:56.800]  documents we cover it my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement this is
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:55:02.880]  the major issue and here's Fox News Maryland Bands chemical BPA and it goes
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:11.680]  on to say that it's for only babies well fluoride hurts children and babies the
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:15.960]  studies show a lot more than it hurts adults but you don't hear that being
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:20.640]  banned no they push it on children in fact we have government documents that
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.160]  Aaron showed me last night that I intend to do a piece on next week where
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:31.360]  they're actually at many public schools in England in the US have fluoride
[02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:36.920]  systems hooked up not making it one part per million but four parts per million
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:40.720]  and you know they come into the schools with those little red fluoride pills I
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:43.640]  remember when that would happen to me in first and second grade I would take it
[02:55:43.640 --> 02:55:47.320]  and get sick and have a headache and be throwing up by the time my mom picked me
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:52.480]  up after school and no one ever put two and two together and the teachers and
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:57.400]  Dennis think they're helping you but this is an IQ reduction fluoride also
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:02.560]  attacks and sterilizes you Fox News goes on meanwhile Berlin based urologist
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:06.760]  professor Frank somer told the London Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that men
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:13.440]  could ingest enough BPA from its use in receipts alone it's it's commonly used
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:20.840]  as the black ink to suppress male hormones in the body and reduce fertility
[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:28.360]  or even sterilize you that's Fox News here is the Baltimore Sun Senate passes
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:33.480]  BPA ban and bottles cups for small children there's no reason this has
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:39.240]  been chosen and adopted because it's meant to sterilize you now continuing if
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:44.960]  you just search the term food irradiation you'll learn the EPA approved
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:51.560]  this in the last decade and they're irradiating beef poultry fish produce and
[02:56:51.560 --> 02:56:58.320]  it destroys the food value it breaks the ring structures in the food and it's
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:01.960]  basically dead food you're now eating and it loses most of its nutritional
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:07.800]  value that's another issue that we didn't even get into in this piece and the
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:13.640]  list just goes on and on and on there are hundreds of petrochemical distillates
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:20.760]  the leftovers of oil refining that are put as quote flavor enhancers and things
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:26.760]  to preserve food as preservatives that are highly toxic and that's that process
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:31.560]  food taste that that you become accustomed to but once you've stopped
[02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:35.640]  eating a lot of processed food it tastes like crud I remember when I was a kid
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:41.080]  eating processed food going hmm what's that kind of dirty taste that spicy toxic
[02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:46.760]  taste that you eat in processed foods well it's it's things like the chemical
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:51.520]  and city of silly putty and that's not Alex Jones saying that that's seeing and
[02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:58.800]  admitting oh silly putty plastic chemical a type of silicone is in all
[02:57:58.800 --> 02:58:02.800]  these different processed foods these different TV dinners chicken McNuggets
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:07.360]  Taco Bell shells what came out a few years ago about Taco Bell they had on
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.520]  their store shelves what they were selling people at the fast food restaurant
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:16.040]  the Starlink corn that wasn't even approved for humans and they had to
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:20.680]  recall it because the violent reactions people had were so bad they couldn't
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:26.320]  cover it up and the government approves it these corporations are advised to use
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:31.400]  it it's cheap and they do please investigate this for yourself and get
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:37.480]  that video and get it out to everyone today it is so important that we warn
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:41.600]  everyone we can beat these people if we do it together
