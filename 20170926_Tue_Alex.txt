[00:00.000 --> 00:17.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:17.480 --> 00:24.240]  There is no longer any doubt the unified corporate globalist media is pushing an open race war
[00:24.240 --> 00:33.120]  in America. The NFL and every other Hollywood-connected group of narcissistic shelf-entitled rich dirtbags
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.300]  and lined up like cowards, believing they'll break the will of the American people when
[00:38.300 --> 00:44.160]  all they're doing is irrevocably separating the boys from the men as the true patriots
[00:44.160 --> 00:50.520]  in America of every color come together and forever separate ourselves from the globalist
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.720]  and the pushers of guilt. That's all coming up, but first, the looming threat of nuclear
[00:55.720 --> 01:01.080]  war. North Korea says the U.S. is already declared war.
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.320]  Following President Trump's condemnation of tyrannical dictatorships at the United Nations
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.960]  last week, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho made the dangerous assumption that
[01:11.960 --> 01:15.360]  the United States has declared war with North Korea.
[01:15.360 --> 01:19.920]  The North Korea's Foreign Minister said that President Trump had declared war on North
[01:19.920 --> 01:25.360]  Korea and that it reserved the right to take countermeasures including shooting down U.S.
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.560]  aircraft. Does the White House view President Trump's comments at the U.N. as a declaration
[01:30.560 --> 01:35.360]  of war? Not at all. We've not declared war on North Korea and frankly the suggestion
[01:35.360 --> 01:41.360]  of that is absurd. The absurd reality that the person like Trump, a mentally deranged
[01:41.360 --> 01:48.200]  person full of megalomania and complacence, the person who is chastised even by American
[01:48.200 --> 01:57.480]  people as commander in grief, lying king, president evil is holding the seat of the U.S. presidents
[01:57.480 --> 02:03.680]  and the dangerous reality that the gambler who grew old using threats, frauds and all
[02:03.680 --> 02:11.000]  other schemes to acquire a patch of land holds the nuclear button. These are what constitute
[02:11.000 --> 02:19.960]  the gravest threat to the international peace and security today. During his eight months
[02:19.960 --> 02:28.520]  in power, he has turned the White House into a noisy marketing place full of crackling
[02:28.520 --> 02:34.840]  sounds of abacus bees and now he has tried to turn the U.N. arena into a gangster's
[02:34.840 --> 02:42.480]  nest where money is respected and bloodshed is the order of the day. He tried to insult
[02:42.480 --> 02:52.080]  the supreme dignity of my country by referring it to a rocket. By doing so, however, he committed
[02:52.080 --> 03:00.160]  an irreversible mistake of making our rockets visit to the entire U.S. mainland inevitable
[03:00.160 --> 03:10.200]  all the more. In case innocent lives of the U.S. are harmed because of this suicide attack,
[03:10.200 --> 03:18.640]  Trump will be held totally responsible. What else could be a bigger threat than the violent
[03:18.640 --> 03:26.160]  remarks such as pouring fire and fury, total destruction coming from the top authority
[03:26.160 --> 03:34.280]  of the world's biggest nuclear power? The very reason the DPRK had to possess nuclear
[03:34.280 --> 03:40.360]  weapons is because of the U.S. And it had to strengthen and develop its nuclear force
[03:40.360 --> 03:46.600]  onto the current level to cope with the U.S. The only valid philosophical principle is
[03:46.600 --> 03:53.440]  that force must be dealt with force and nuclear weapons of tyranny must be dealt with nuclear
[03:53.440 --> 03:58.400]  hammer of justice. President Trump responded in a tweet saying
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.600]  just heard foreign minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of little
[04:03.600 --> 04:10.000]  rocket man, they won't be around much longer. This exchange gives Kim Jong-un's irrational
[04:10.000 --> 04:16.360]  dictatorship all the propaganda it needs to shoot down U.S. bombers that have been performing
[04:16.360 --> 04:22.680]  drills in international waters. Meanwhile, serious sanctions are underway as China bans
[04:22.680 --> 04:29.240]  exports of petroleum products and imports of North Korean textiles beginning October
[04:29.240 --> 04:35.100]  1. Additionally, President Trump signed off on a ban of travelers from North Korea, Chad
[04:35.100 --> 04:40.480]  and Venezuela, barring senior government officials from those countries from obtaining
[04:40.480 --> 04:46.200]  non-immigrant visas. North Korea is just beginning to feel the pressure of President Trump's
[04:46.200 --> 04:53.000]  rallying of the international community to take the DPRK seriously. John Bound reporting
[04:53.000 --> 05:22.000]  for info wars dot com.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.120]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only that gives everything
[05:27.120 --> 05:32.120]  its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange
[05:32.120 --> 05:37.560]  indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with
[05:37.560 --> 05:42.560]  an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax but to
[05:42.560 --> 05:47.960]  bind us in all cases whatsoever. And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.960]  is no such thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious for so unlimited
[06:17.960 --> 06:21.960]  compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it
[06:21.960 --> 06:27.400]  supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally
[06:27.400 --> 06:32.000]  have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.160]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to
[06:36.160 --> 06:40.880]  your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay

[06:46.520 --> 06:51.080]  of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused

[07:58.760 --> 08:14.140]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from
[08:14.140 --> 08:27.120]  the front lines of the Infowars ë®¤g
[08:27.120 --> 08:33.520]  saying that they will preemptively strike the United States and threaten the American people
[08:34.480 --> 08:40.000]  to remove Donald Trump from office or they'll basically hit us with hydrogen bombs
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.760]  dipped on top of intercontinental ballistic missiles. They've been terrorizing their own slave
[08:47.760 --> 08:54.240]  population for almost 70 years and now they think they can shake their fists at us and do the same
[08:54.240 --> 09:00.160]  thing. Former congressman and all-around really intelligent historian and medical doctor
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  Ron Paul will be joining us coming up the start of the next hour. He's written a big article
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.280]  that's up at newswars.com and it's also on infowars.com. Ron Paul, how to end the Korea crisis. Kim
[09:15.280 --> 09:24.880]  joined Saddam Gaddafi Assad on a list of madmen says Paul and Kim Jong-un better understand
[09:25.760 --> 09:30.880]  when they start calling you a madman at the Pentagon that means you're about to get killed buddy
[09:32.160 --> 09:36.640]  and I don't want this to happen I don't want to have to go to nuclear brinkmanship but
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.360]  you are about to get blown off the map just like the Germans just like the Japanese
[09:41.360 --> 09:48.800]  and just like everybody else so you want it all your little stupid communist outfits you're about
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.680]  to get it and I understand the globalists are in the middle of this and I understand America's
[09:53.680 --> 10:00.640]  got problems and I understand all that but I was against the Iraq war I was against backing the
[10:00.640 --> 10:06.800]  Arab Spring I was against all the wars that turned out to be frauds but this one is real
[10:06.800 --> 10:13.440]  and never stopped since 1953 it's just been hit on pause like you're playing a video game you
[10:13.440 --> 10:18.080]  hit pause or you're watching a movie you hit pause you you know go take care of something come back
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.560]  an hour later well you come back how many years has it been since 1953
[10:26.160 --> 10:34.880]  how many years has it been since 1953 60 plus years and the game never stopped and we've got the
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.920]  third generation of a hereditary dictator there and I understand it's not just that if we nuke
[10:41.920 --> 10:48.000]  North Korea then other countries may primitively hit us down the road they might do it that day
[10:51.440 --> 10:56.400]  or India and Pakistan who've already been threatened to nuke each other might do it or
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.880]  India and China they say war is like a virus and once it starts spreading at that level
[11:02.880 --> 11:12.720]  it gets out of control like fire war is extremely dangerous and in times of global crisis
[11:14.480 --> 11:20.880]  political unrest economic unrest global hysteria large populations things of this nature come
[11:20.880 --> 11:29.040]  to a head and planets align in a very dangerous way that adds accelerant to the fire like 150
[11:29.040 --> 11:40.640]  mile an hour winds on a dry day through the forest and I've got four children I know that I thank God
[11:40.640 --> 11:47.600]  and my lucky stars every single day that we're not already in the middle of a giant nuclear war
[11:47.600 --> 11:54.800]  that we've survived this long and so I certainly don't at some primitive level want to show Kim
[11:54.800 --> 12:01.920]  Jung Un who's the better man and I you know I associate nationalistic with America and so I
[12:01.920 --> 12:11.280]  want to have a war so I can have some more national pride the truth is our government gave them the
[12:11.280 --> 12:16.800]  nuclear reactors and the missiles to create a strategy of tension in the region in the region
[12:16.800 --> 12:25.360]  and have an excuse for us to be there but we didn't originally put the communist in we fought them
[12:25.360 --> 12:35.760]  as far as Korea goes we did put Mao in in 47 48 49 fully just a few years before this war started
[12:35.760 --> 12:40.880]  and he turned around and stabbed America in the back and saw us as weak and decided he was going
[12:40.880 --> 12:51.040]  to take Korea Vietnam and everything else but the intellectuals inside our government thought
[12:51.040 --> 12:56.160]  communism was a better system because they'd be in charge of it there's an article up on news wars
[12:56.160 --> 13:04.400]  dot com right now where a west point grad who's a cavernic fan has written inside of his hat
[13:04.400 --> 13:13.520]  communism will win right as he's graduating that image that photo that story is up on info wars
[13:13.520 --> 13:19.120]  dot com and news wars dot com we'll be getting to it and we just tweeted it out
[13:22.080 --> 13:23.280]  at real alex jones
[13:26.320 --> 13:32.000]  there's a lot of powerful forces in each country manipulating to get more control over their
[13:32.000 --> 13:43.440]  populations and to obviously power grab even more control but what you've got is a bunch of people
[13:43.440 --> 13:57.520]  in this nation that have been taught that it's cool that have been taught that it's fun
[13:57.520 --> 14:06.480]  that have been taught that that's how they get attention that have been taught that
[14:08.240 --> 14:15.600]  the more chips on your shoulder you have it's like more degrees and the bigger a thumbsucker
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.320]  you are and the lazier you are and the more entitled you are and the more arrogant you are
[14:20.320 --> 14:26.800]  the more powerful you are but of course you're not your losers
[14:29.280 --> 14:36.720]  and the nfl and other gladiatorial diversions are what helped low america to sleep and we
[14:36.720 --> 14:43.040]  decided that the nfl was america not our coal mines not our industry not our churches not
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.960]  our beliefs not our second amendment not our religious freedom not our strength not our will
[14:48.960 --> 14:55.120]  not our dogged rugged individualistic spirit that refuses to back down no we were taught that
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.680]  men out there in simulated combat were the greatest heroes and as the society became
[15:03.680 --> 15:10.320]  decadent and more narcissistic and corrupt and more godless and more pathetic just as hollywood
[15:10.320 --> 15:16.880]  became completely degenerate and completely anti-american so have all the other spoiled
[15:16.880 --> 15:28.080]  bastions of elitism and now their final enjoyment is politically hating their own fans culturally
[15:28.080 --> 15:36.720]  hating their own fans and having giant entitled pity parties directed by the most vicious ruthless
[15:36.720 --> 15:42.160]  think tanks and crime syndicates and multinational combines the world has ever seen
[15:42.160 --> 15:52.000]  if you ever wanted to witness the full bore battering ram attack to knock down america
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.320]  and to break our will and to bully us in the globalist submission to hate ourselves to hate
[15:58.320 --> 16:03.280]  our flag to hate our freedom to hate our military to hate everything because we're the big object
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.880]  to capture for global domination you capture america you have the world the communists the
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.720]  socialists put in by robber barons protected by the technocrats to this day because they
[16:14.720 --> 16:21.680]  shit and enslave their people they squat on top their slave populations they are who the
[16:21.680 --> 16:26.880]  globalists want to deal with in carol quickley's own words at georgetown top political science
[16:26.880 --> 16:32.560]  professor there author of tragedy and hope trainer of hundreds and hundreds of high-level
[16:32.560 --> 16:38.720]  state department and cia officials to understand the great vision the great world view the great
[16:38.720 --> 16:46.800]  program of authoritarianism by every flavor by every color of the rainbow but still the great
[16:46.800 --> 16:52.880]  goal of total global domination and social engineering over every aspect of human activity
[16:52.880 --> 16:59.680]  to the point of rendering a rebellion by the people as is impossible as a rebellion of sheep
[16:59.680 --> 17:11.520]  against the practice of eating mutton to quote burgeon mussel they have many tools to control us
[17:11.520 --> 17:18.080]  they first claim they have the moral high ground that they're the intellectuals they claim they're
[17:18.080 --> 17:24.160]  the resistance they claim they're battling the establishment when they at the nfl and they in
[17:24.160 --> 17:32.640]  hollywood and they in the big tv networks and the entertainment combines are all extensions
[17:33.200 --> 17:41.200]  of the true global ruling class that wishes to dynamite the ladders of ascendancy for their fellow
[17:41.200 --> 17:52.080]  humans so that they can control the development both culturally evolutionary and spiritually
[17:52.080 --> 18:02.880]  of the human species it's a cold-blooded full bore 110 pure selfish power grab
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.040]  and look at what we have here three years of people kneeling and bitching at the bloated
[18:11.040 --> 18:16.320]  pathetic nfl as their ratings are down more than 35 percent from just three years ago
[18:16.320 --> 18:25.360]  and as the stadiums are more than half empty in some areas it's down by 50 60 percent on average
[18:25.360 --> 18:33.440]  40 got the numbers right here that's flatlining and i love all the decadent slob like pathetic
[18:33.440 --> 18:41.840]  i'ma skip this break owners all trying to lock arms together against america thinking that if they
[18:41.840 --> 18:49.680]  can just break the will of trump that somehow the fans will come back when what you've done is assured
[18:49.680 --> 18:57.040]  that 30 40 percent isn't never coming back and another 20 or 30 percent will soon follow and
[18:57.040 --> 19:02.000]  then they're going to stop watching you on tv entirely because everybody's got a sick feeling
[19:02.000 --> 19:08.240]  now that they're in the enemy camp that they're being preyed on by a bunch of losers when they're
[19:08.240 --> 19:16.320]  part of this and so a beautiful thing is happening because they captured the nfl they captured american
[19:16.320 --> 19:22.960]  institutions they've been beating us over the head with them and now because they pushed and pushed
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.960]  and pushed into all the sanctums of where people just wanted to take off time and sit around and
[19:28.960 --> 19:36.640]  you know watch the fox sunday football with terry bradshaw and all the rest of them to just see
[19:36.640 --> 19:45.600]  unified america hate unified virtue signaling unified hype unified peer pressure by a bunch of
[19:45.600 --> 19:53.680]  followers and a bunch of losers because if you don't bow to what the globalists want and then
[19:53.680 --> 20:00.240]  it'll be every other little social signal after this if you don't give in to this if you don't do
[20:00.240 --> 20:05.360]  whatever they say if you don't accept that you're bad and you're racist and you're evil and that
[20:05.360 --> 20:11.680]  you've got to politically do whatever they say in this new cult you're in but we're going to get
[20:11.680 --> 20:19.360]  you fired you know the hispanic gentleman i wouldn't say his name now because it's it's a shameful
[20:19.360 --> 20:23.760]  name not an honorable name to a great extent they threaten to fire him just like that the
[20:23.760 --> 20:33.680]  the coach said he was looking at this disciplining him on sunday he was the lone stealer
[20:35.600 --> 20:40.640]  alejandro that would come out army veteran army ranger veteran and put his hand over his chest
[20:43.760 --> 20:47.200]  let's see the rest of the team had said no we're a cult you don't have free speech
[20:47.760 --> 20:52.320]  we can act like we're pissing on trump in the in the end zone that's okay nobody gets fine for that

[21:57.520 --> 22:03.120]  a job probably running a sub directorate of a major intelligence agency you call yourself

[22:35.440 --> 22:41.840]  him out of the navy if we can but man another guy pulls up on a shake with our shirt and says
[22:41.840 --> 22:49.120]  communism will win and you know now in the halls of power young man you're a good trader you're
[22:49.120 --> 22:53.920]  going to lower that drawbridge and bring down the republic we need scum like you good job
[22:53.920 --> 23:05.200]  that's how late the hour is and look at these clips we've got coming up nba coach
[23:07.440 --> 23:13.440]  white people especially need to be made to feel uncomfortable oh like the 10 to 1 attacks on whites
[23:13.440 --> 23:18.240]  by blacks because they deserve it the black folks in the i've got a couple crime reports right here
[23:18.240 --> 23:22.160]  the guy that went in and shot a bunch of people telling folks that tennessee church because they
[23:22.160 --> 23:27.520]  were white and christian and he was an immigrant from sudana a muslim he said on his facebook he
[23:28.400 --> 23:31.600]  confessed the police he said i wanted to kill a bunch of white people because they're racist
[23:34.880 --> 23:38.000]  well if they weren't before they might be now and i think that's a bad thing
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.520]  no white folks on average see through all this i wonder if there'll be anybody taking
[23:43.520 --> 23:51.360]  knees for those folks that got shot in the face in the back no that remember a year ago the nfl
[23:51.360 --> 23:56.240]  the the dallas cowboys wouldn't even have a few seconds for the five dead police officers a couple
[23:56.240 --> 24:08.560]  of them black in dallas who got shot in the back by black lives matter and killed and they denied
[24:08.560 --> 24:14.000]  the request they told the dallas police department you got to pay money for that
[24:14.000 --> 24:22.160]  and of course you know the nfl's getting paid you know it's come out they're getting paid for
[24:22.160 --> 24:26.880]  everything you see them do all this anti-american crap they're getting paid by big foundations
[24:26.880 --> 24:31.120]  just like comedy central's getting paid to put out a show every night of the week lying about
[24:31.120 --> 24:38.480]  yours truly misrepresenting what i say and what i do and i don't even know i'll even address that
[24:38.480 --> 24:45.280]  though they want fodder for their little show because they're not really that important
[24:45.920 --> 24:51.200]  but it is important to address the propaganda and in the piece they let you know their first show
[24:51.200 --> 24:58.080]  last night who the enemy is and you notice china i first told you this about a decade ago but now
[24:58.080 --> 25:09.680]  it's been all the news china finances the majority of us movies and all six of the big movie houses
[25:09.680 --> 25:20.000]  the production companies and they pay in some cases 20 million dollars per film to just show
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.560]  a lot line of communist chinese flags to show a pilot bureau and to have the chinese president
[25:26.560 --> 25:32.880]  who's a dictator save the world from the aliens they paid money for that in arrival look it up
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.320]  they paid money in the martian that america couldn't produce booster rockets to get to mars and the
[25:40.320 --> 25:46.000]  rescue mission but the chinese had rockets they had to get them from us the u.s won't even let us
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.080]  produce our own rockets now as part of a strategic sabotage under obama we have to get them from the
[25:50.080 --> 25:58.800]  russians the united states had as good a boosters as the russians have now in the 70s but the plans
[25:58.800 --> 26:06.400]  were destroyed under secret executive order that's right the plans drawn up by the german scientists
[26:06.400 --> 26:15.520]  were destroyed more globalist sabotage and one of these shows the opposition to see in the show
[26:15.520 --> 26:21.120]  he goes we're the conservatives we're the opposition to the resistance that's the big lie when we're
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.200]  the resistance trumps the resistance you're the result we have the whole power structure the whole
[26:25.200 --> 26:31.040]  globalist force the communist chinese the pope hollywood the media the big think tanks the big
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.480]  telecoms the big computer companies the big social networks facebook twitter's google's all
[26:36.480 --> 26:42.240]  against trump and america and the reassurgence and the nba and then and the national baseball
[26:42.240 --> 26:47.680]  league and all of it all lined up against us and little info wars is one of the big threats
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.480]  little little info wars
[26:56.480 --> 27:02.080]  and then the first thing they tell you in their promo china isn't real no brother we've
[27:02.080 --> 27:06.240]  sent our reporters many times to china we had our reporters inside north korea
[27:06.240 --> 27:14.080]  i get on the phone and talk to high-level people in the agencies you name it the president what
[27:14.080 --> 27:20.080]  do you mean i don't know that china is real that's what they sell that we're these insular
[27:20.880 --> 27:26.080]  country bumpkins that don't know i know china is probably in fact let's look into it because i
[27:26.080 --> 27:30.240]  know they're funding time warner productions and i know they've had a bunch of mergers and stuff
[27:30.240 --> 27:34.320]  isn't comedy central i meant to do this this morning to check it i don't even pay attention
[27:34.320 --> 27:37.120]  aren't they owned by time warner please look that up for me
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.960]  now i know comedy central who owns comedy central who owns comedy central put that in a search engine
[27:46.240 --> 27:50.720]  and i guarantee you because i know time warner gets money from the communist chinese i know
[27:50.720 --> 27:56.560]  universal i know fox i know they all do so i said notice i went from memory i see it's either viacom
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.480]  or it's because i it's been going back and forth so viacom it's owned by viacom
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.840]  viacom gets a massive money they own cbs they own a bunch of the production houses viacom is
[28:07.840 --> 28:17.440]  the biggest media company in the world shumner redstone is its founder viacom group and they are
[28:17.440 --> 28:21.600]  so in bed with the communist chinese it'll make your head spin so now when they go look at these
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.960]  dumb-ass nationalist americans alex jones he says china isn't real hey that's a lie
[28:26.960 --> 28:32.880]  you think that little candy-ass host that reads off teleprompters knows their demographics their
[28:32.880 --> 28:37.440]  numbers the about the chin dynasty their wars against japan the history of what happened
[28:37.440 --> 28:43.040]  in south korea all the different angles about shank i checked the nationalist how the cia
[28:43.040 --> 28:46.800]  put malin all the different white papers written about how the cia supported
[28:48.320 --> 28:54.240]  no no they don't know any of that i i know so much on china it makes my head hurt but see
[28:54.240 --> 29:00.320]  we can get a skinny slender you know guy with a psychopath physique and he could sit there and
[29:00.320 --> 29:12.480]  wolf like tell you that alex jones doesn't know anything alex jones says china isn't real and they
[29:12.480 --> 29:21.760]  call it the opposition and they've got a term here about mental nationalism well if you don't
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.080]  have nationalism in your own interest at heart you're called a slave but see they they invent
[29:26.080 --> 29:31.200]  these new words the media acts like they're great linguists but they have giant teams of hundreds
[29:31.200 --> 29:38.640]  pouring over this crap they put out it's not even funny they all hail it as god and they spew all
[29:38.640 --> 29:45.680]  this bull it's all coming up today congressman ron paul on a plan to stop the north korean crisis
[29:45.680 --> 29:53.360]  that's on info wars dot com as well but we're not intellectual like you know alex jones and the gcn
[29:53.360 --> 30:03.040]  radio network what exactly is political correctness why is it being pushed on the american public
[30:03.040 --> 30:07.920]  well political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses
[30:07.920 --> 30:12.240]  to control public opinion by controlling your opinions the establishment gets you to not only
[30:12.240 --> 30:17.200]  agree with their agenda but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also influences
[30:17.200 --> 30:21.120]  others in ripple effect this is how the power elite and the government stay in power the use
[30:21.120 --> 30:25.840]  psychological manipulation they turn the public into obedient sheeple and over time we lose our
[30:25.840 --> 30:30.320]  ability to distinguish reality from deception but how does political correctness and other
[30:30.320 --> 30:34.800]  deliberate deceptions work well first the establishment saturates mass media with their
[30:34.800 --> 30:39.760]  agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted
[30:39.760 --> 30:44.480]  as truth such as global warming for example then the establishment suppresses any counterarguments
[30:44.480 --> 30:49.680]  through their agenda by calling critics kooky nutjobs racist or in the case of man made climate

[34:22.080 --> 34:29.040]  fed on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com drudge report dot com is linked to the exclusive

[34:35.920 --> 34:47.600]  that as it unfolds more on north korea more on the nfl but this nfl thing is absolutely gigantic
[34:47.600 --> 34:55.200]  because they're trying to break our will and they're trying to stay in your own country
[34:55.200 --> 35:02.240]  your flags racist your nation's bad and then once you learn to bow quite literally bowing to zod
[35:02.240 --> 35:08.960]  superman bow to zod uh that's not just in fiction that's in the real world once you show your
[35:08.960 --> 35:15.360]  subservience to george soros and their psychological warfare combine where they've used cultural
[35:15.360 --> 35:19.280]  differences to bring down the middle east to bring down eastern europe to bring down countless
[35:19.280 --> 35:26.880]  nations and peoples they're now doing it here and it's in the wiki leaks that they're using culture
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.240]  war to carry that out and we've got the republican establishment that is involved in it as well
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.960]  we're going to get to that in a moment the very powerful words of steven bannon
[35:44.880 --> 35:50.240]  but know this globalism is a consortium of other nations and mega corporations
[35:50.240 --> 35:58.160]  in power by slave labor via china to dominate and take control of the nation state of america
[35:58.160 --> 36:04.240]  and to culturally and economically deindustrialize us and break our will and whether it's viacom
[36:04.240 --> 36:10.880]  or whether it's news core or whether it's time warner there's only six big movie houses owned by
[36:11.760 --> 36:17.760]  five big companies that have 95 percent of mainstream media control and they are all
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.840]  now chiefly financed by the communist chinese because they're going bankrupt first they sell
[36:23.840 --> 36:32.640]  the country out first they impoverish the nation then they make all their major films china-centric
[36:32.640 --> 36:42.080]  and communist supportive and now we see bill marr hbo we see all these hollywood stars saying we
[36:42.080 --> 36:49.200]  like kim jong-un we hate trump trade leaders with us that's very sick and very evil even if you
[36:49.200 --> 36:55.280]  hate trump but that's how far they've gone in the financing of hollywood by communist china
[36:56.960 --> 37:04.560]  and when you look at viacom and comedy central that it owns and you look at how all their major
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.840]  programs attack yours truly and the president and others and misrepresent what we say and take it
[37:09.840 --> 37:14.960]  out of context to demonize us and tell us that they're the resistance yeah they're the globalist
[37:14.960 --> 37:23.360]  resistance to america and they are against this country just like the nfl is they are disgusting
[37:23.360 --> 37:28.560]  and they've all got to be cut off they've got to be fully bankrupted and they're jokes
[37:30.400 --> 37:36.240]  and they know that they're bought and paid for they're consciously against this country
[37:36.240 --> 37:42.720]  and that's why every major movie you see that's based in science fiction or based in modern affairs
[37:42.720 --> 37:51.040]  or based in military activity the communist chinese come in and save america hell the director of the
[37:51.040 --> 37:56.320]  transformers is coming out with a movie that's based on escape from new york where the communist
[37:56.320 --> 38:05.600]  chinese join with the u.s military in a coup to remove trump i mean this is naked and all you need
[38:05.600 --> 38:14.080]  to know about the opposition is they're the establishment and that comedy central is the
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.960]  opposition to america and they are the opposition of the resistance so when they put up stuff like
[38:18.960 --> 38:25.760]  china isn't real and stuff like that it's like laud blank flying coming out a few months ago when
[38:25.760 --> 38:33.600]  trump had infrastructure week and said how's that going for you trump knowing congress was blocking it
[38:33.600 --> 38:39.680]  and saying i just got back from china we're moving our main operations it's incredible
[38:40.720 --> 38:44.320]  yeah and the slave plants are great and the suicide nets are great the forced abortions
[38:44.320 --> 38:47.920]  are great and the organ harvesting of christians and buddhists is great but it doesn't matter because
[38:47.920 --> 38:54.560]  you're laud blank fine and you've got this sick thing about somebody was rude to your grandpa in
[38:54.560 --> 39:01.040]  new york once when he got off a boat or something so you think if you just destroy america and hate
[39:01.040 --> 39:07.120]  america that somehow it's going to empower you even though you are america laud blank fine
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.880]  and the media thinks it's cute in cnbc oh look how he trolled the president and talked about
[39:14.880 --> 39:20.320]  how pathetic we are yay let's all get on the trader bandwagon
[39:20.320 --> 39:30.880]  we're gonna break all this down and i'm gonna get back into the harry carry the sepacoo
[39:32.720 --> 39:39.600]  the suicide for all the linguists over there at viacom that are so delicate geniuses and
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.520]  so smart and teach us how conservatives are low information voters when i've been out to your crowds

[39:50.000 --> 39:56.080]  i feel sorry for them they look like they got hit by a mental retardation beam and like they've
[39:56.080 --> 40:01.120]  been drinking flora i know i guess they have which cnn now has to admit causes mutation brain
[40:01.120 --> 40:10.480]  damage everything else the entire dallas cowboy team takes a knee gets booed flashback nfl tonight
[40:10.480 --> 40:21.920]  cowboys request to honor cop slain and dallas cnn msnbc slave master trump once race war wishes

[40:26.480 --> 40:30.720]  happening whites all over the place are getting killed and a lot of poor immigrants from eastern
[40:30.720 --> 40:34.720]  europe that are white are moving into black areas and every couple days they get shot or hit over
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.440]  them with a hammer or killed and people say i killed them because they're white black lives matter
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.560]  as if eastern europeans had anything ever to do with the slave trade you look at arabs
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.720]  almost all arabs lineage were involved in slave trade that's all they had there in the desert
[40:48.720 --> 40:56.080]  was slave trading and controlling other different uh trade routes the silk routes and others that's

[41:59.440 --> 42:04.560]  released though it's all cute it's all fun you're not going to hear anything about him you're not
[42:04.560 --> 42:10.480]  going to hear any whites bitching either and like blaming all blacks for it jesse jackson trumps nfl
[42:10.480 --> 42:16.960]  statement show slave master servant mentality nba coach white people had to be made to feel
[42:16.960 --> 42:24.800]  uncomfortable another virtue signaling idiot of the spurs tennessee church shooter admits to crime
[42:24.800 --> 42:29.920]  as bizarre facebook post surfaces but again that's okay you're not going to hear anything about those
[42:29.920 --> 42:35.600]  guys you're not going to hear any virtue signaling about that because that's a white devil that's
[42:35.600 --> 42:42.320]  a bunch of white devils that got shot and killed oh but don't worry in berkeley they allowed the
[42:42.320 --> 42:47.840]  march against white supremacy to happen nobody attacked that because it was the antifa scum
[42:47.840 --> 42:53.520]  and the faculty having their march but they banned my lo and everybody else and then physically
[42:53.520 --> 42:58.320]  attacked my reporters who i didn't order to go they wanted to go millie weaver and uh and gabin
[42:58.320 --> 43:04.000]  went and then they broke into her car and ransacked and tore up our equipment there's video of that
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.760]  upon info wars dot com but that's okay you don't have a right to have speech and then when we catch you
[43:10.480 --> 43:15.760]  filming us in our speeches we're going to follow back to your car and rob it and and tear it up
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.560]  and then we're going to attack women but that because see they're the heroes fighting itler
[43:20.560 --> 43:30.160]  so it's okay it's fun it's a bunch of wimps that just live here in the country and direct violence
[43:31.360 --> 43:35.680]  and then say i just came and shot your church up i just came and beat up a woman i just came and

[43:44.880 --> 43:49.600]  and they've got the nfl player we can show it hiking his leg and acting like he pee peed
[43:49.600 --> 43:54.640]  oh he didn't get fine for that though because you know you work for the team you're not allowed
[43:54.640 --> 43:59.520]  to have your own speech on the field not allowed to flip folks off whatever but oh you can practice
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.480]  peeing on the president and then later say no i'm practicing pissing on the that's what it is
[44:04.480 --> 44:11.600]  it's peeing right it's dominating you we're only paid 20 million dollars a year i hate this country
[44:11.600 --> 44:21.600]  because viacom told me to summoner redstone told me to yeah well summoner redstone got
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.080]  locked up by his family is hanging on by his fingernails right now like he did off that
[44:26.080 --> 44:32.160]  balcony in that fire but he's not going to be able to hold on forever hold on and the devil
[44:32.160 --> 44:38.960]  his god is waiting with a big open mouth just right there for you summoner and all the rest
[44:38.960 --> 44:46.400]  the scum at viacom we're gonna do some big reports on the chinese money going into viacom
[44:46.400 --> 44:53.040]  the communist state run money going into viacom and that story is up on news wars peeing in
[44:53.040 --> 45:00.880]  america's face info wars reporter car vandalized that's okay they deserve it violent crime rises
[45:00.880 --> 45:07.120]  in us in democratic cities two years running oh yeah actually getting killed by black on black
[45:07.120 --> 45:12.240]  90 plus percent of the time but that's okay most the blocks are getting aborted that's all right
[45:12.240 --> 45:14.960]  with the liberals because they're there to enslave them and everybody else
[45:18.560 --> 45:24.160]  and the racial attacks on whites only intensifies every day and it just gets in the back of the
[45:24.160 --> 45:38.480]  paper they usually won't even say who did it but first let me get into this right now banan
[45:38.480 --> 45:44.640]  warns gop establishment your day of reckoning is coming and i'm really proud of banan trying to
[45:44.640 --> 45:51.360]  keep trombone straight and narrow and being run out by the generals and others and he really is
[45:51.360 --> 45:59.600]  supporting right folks he really is supporting good real tea party libertarian americana
[46:00.400 --> 46:04.160]  what you call yellow dog democrat type folks as well just people that aren't out to get the country
[46:05.120 --> 46:12.240]  and you've got this whole race going on in alabama and he just leveled his political guns
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.960]  right on the people around the president he said the president's a great guy but he got misinformed
[46:16.960 --> 46:23.760]  about who to back and now it's an example of a fight over the heart and soul the republican party
[46:23.760 --> 46:30.080]  of who wins this runoff election this primary republican election and here are some of these
[46:30.080 --> 46:35.280]  powerful clips from banan first let's get to this clip banan on nfl protest they should
[46:35.280 --> 46:39.120]  take a knee every night and thank god donald trump's president because even though he disagrees with
[46:39.120 --> 46:45.680]  some of what trump's doing just like senator paul said on this show a few months ago just like he
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.400]  his father i'll guarantee you'll say next hour we ought to thank god every day we got trump in
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.600]  because hillary would have been even worse on war and the economy and so many other issues
[46:57.280 --> 47:02.640]  but here's banan on nfl protest you know about taking a knee for the national anthem i said in
[47:02.640 --> 47:06.560]  this speech tonight if people in this country take a knee and the national football league players
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.680]  want to take a knee they should take a knee at night every night and thank god in heaven donald
[47:11.680 --> 47:16.880]  j trump is president united states he has saved this country so much grief he has done such a
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.840]  tremendous job with virtually no help and that's what i meant when i said that i stepped out to
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.880]  make sure that mitch mcconnell in the republican establishment starts to have a republican back
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.280]  because you know what mitch mcconnell wouldn't be majority leader if donald trump didn't drag
[47:31.280 --> 47:36.160]  a half a dozen senators across the goal line in november so it's time for the republican
[47:36.160 --> 47:41.440]  establishment to step up and have the back of president trump steve bannon's the real deal
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.600]  blue collar democrat union family whole nine yards and he understands the scam against all
[47:47.600 --> 47:52.720]  working people and if you want real prosperity folks just let let the banan plan get delivered
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.960]  it's classic americana jfk program that's why the globalist are pissed man they think this country's
[47:58.960 --> 48:07.600]  theirs the communist chinese have bought controlling interests in all five major mega companies and all
[48:07.600 --> 48:15.520]  six subsidiary movie production houses studios i mean that's how far gone we are folks
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.480]  every episode of these comedy central shows have some chinese communist worship piece
[48:24.480 --> 48:31.520]  so those dictators over there that keep christians in cages and sell their organs and have factories
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.840]  with suicide nets around them can sit there and feel powerful
[48:39.360 --> 48:44.640]  and so these media outlets get access to the chinese communist market can you imagine what sell
[48:44.640 --> 48:50.000]  out scum these people are they're all a bunch of failed comedians and actors that read off
[48:50.000 --> 48:56.400]  teleprompters that enemies of this country fill nobody's give me a document camera shot around
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.200]  the room give me a shot there's no there's no script here only the truth and red white and
[49:01.200 --> 49:08.560]  blue and taking it to the enemy and we're going to win steven bannon the gop elite represented
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.960]  by mitch mcconnell hold me in contempt i wear their contempt as a badge of honor absolutely
[49:14.960 --> 49:19.200]  i love that fact
[49:22.240 --> 49:29.040]  it's incredible it's a badge of honor let's go to that next clip the republican the elites
[49:29.040 --> 49:35.280]  represented by mitch mcconnell right hold me in contempt right they think i'm a bad guy they
[49:35.280 --> 49:40.960]  think i'm a dangerous guy i wear their contempt as a badge of honor okay they're they have they
[49:40.960 --> 49:46.160]  have helped destroy this country they have done nothing but allow economic hate crimes against
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.440]  the working men and women in the heartland of this country the factories went to china and the drugs
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.640]  came in okay we've got to stop it tomorrow in alabama the good folks in alabama got a got a
[49:56.640 --> 50:01.840]  choice this is jeff sessions c chan you know how close i am to jeff sessions i know how close you

[50:06.560 --> 50:14.160]  and tough as boot leather this seat is jeff sessions c just look at bannon's eyes but also
[50:14.160 --> 50:19.360]  watches actions it's just straightforward it's the truth you look at all the politico weasels
[50:19.360 --> 50:25.680]  in both parties they're mentally ill they care about what the fake system thinks they have no
[50:25.680 --> 50:32.240]  integrity they have no moral compass they have no rudder they have no north star they have no god
[50:32.240 --> 50:39.280]  but just self-aggrandizement and then that does not fulfill it just drives you deeper into the

[54:06.720 --> 54:10.960]  they know that'll kill the economy that's their goal that's why they wrote obama care
[54:11.600 --> 54:16.400]  the republicans wrote it the democrats love it because they love being schmucks being screwed
[54:16.400 --> 54:23.040]  over by the bipartisan criminals in other news flashback trump warns parents to watch out for
[54:23.040 --> 54:28.080]  pervert weiner says keep your young daughters away from him he's a pervert of course he's convicted
[54:28.080 --> 54:33.760]  of that now trump said it back in 2012 what do you think trump's talking about he also tweeted
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.400]  about pedophile rings and said they should all be executed and they are being arrested at record
[54:38.400 --> 54:46.480]  levels so then i've seen articles in time magazine newsweek aol saying oh no it's a myth
[54:47.840 --> 54:51.280]  that's a talking point though there aren't pedophile rings being busted it doesn't exist
[54:51.280 --> 54:58.560]  yeah i like the deputy pope and senator menendez all the rest of it you people are crazy
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.040]  you are something else man wow can you imagine working for comedy central and posing as a news
[55:05.040 --> 55:10.400]  reporter when you're really a comic and then reading off a teleprompter and defending this
[55:12.720 --> 55:19.120]  what a bunch of desperate losers so that's all coming up as well but yeah republicans
[55:19.120 --> 55:26.320]  to raise taxes consumer confidence falls new home sales hit eight month low and uh you know
[55:26.320 --> 55:30.320]  they were trying to get consumer confidence up didn't get some of their jobs up but didn't get
[55:30.320 --> 55:35.360]  the stock market up but if they can just hold those tax cuts up a little bit longer and keep
[55:35.360 --> 55:40.080]  obama caring a little bit longer they can they can get you then make you real poor and have to live
[55:40.080 --> 55:45.760]  off handouts and boy isn't that sad because they know if we got an open free market you'll vote for
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.840]  what you want which is freedom and then they won't be in charge see too bad isn't it just too bad
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.400]  but intellectually we're breaking with them and so the NFL and all them can go bankrupt with us as

[59:06.480 --> 59:12.400]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were
[59:12.400 --> 59:17.920]  hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:48.800]  that i'm going to be getting to coming up where maxine waters goes next level but right now let's
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.480]  go back to the bandon clips badden at roymor rally in alabama they talk about hate speech let's talk
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:59.600]  about economic hate crimes that's been working men and women of this country that's powerful that
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:10.800]  talking points the truth here it is they talk about hate speech let's talk about economic hate crimes
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:15.520]  have been done on the working men and women in this country they've got it this country they've
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:19.920]  got it in manufacturing jobs and shipped them overseas you know what for for profit
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:26.640]  you think this opioid crisis just came about there's a direct correlation between the factories
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:32.160]  and jobs that were shipped to china and the workers left behind were told to spare that's right it's
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:40.480]  political control strategic military operation now here's mad maxine impeach trump over nfl kneelers
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:45.840]  she's gone completely insane doesn't even make any sense uh she says um we'll just hear it from her
[1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:52.720]  here it is he's pointing now uh to the nfl we know that the majority of these players are african
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:59.680]  americans and we know what he is doing we're not tricked to fool by him in any shape form of fashion
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:06.960]  and someone said how is it he can never criticize putin or the kremlin or charlesville uh and those
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:16.880]  kkk nationalists supremacist uh etc and here he is strongly criticizing you know football players
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:22.720]  and nfl players and so it's clear we know who he is he's defined himself what are we going to do
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:28.240]  about it i know we're not talking about russian collusion today and we're not talking about obstruction
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:34.800]  of justice but i hope people understand it's about all of this that he should not be the president of
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:38.640]  the united states of america and we got to get ready for impeachment and you know what
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:43.200]  so there you go all of that is a lie all he's done is criticize russia when russia's done
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:48.000]  nothing he's been bullied into that all he's done is talk about charles philip nauseam all lies
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.640]  out of that pig's mouth and of course he got a bunch of spoiled rotten racist black players of
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:57.040]  course he's talking about them it was thomas jefferson who once said that our country is now
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:02.000]  taking so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will pass to destruction to wit by consolidation
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.640]  of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence jefferson was warning us about the
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.960]  global elite the one percent of the one percent consolidating the world's wealth and subverting
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:15.280]  the people's voice in government unfortunately we didn't heed his advice we now live in a
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:19.600]  neo feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the
[1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:23.440]  needs of the establishment political office no longer represents the voice of the people but
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:28.400]  rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy
[1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:32.160]  simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet we're suppressed
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:36.160]  by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:40.560]  we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the other
[1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:44.640]  conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as
[1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:48.960]  thomas jefferson also said enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the
[1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:53.760]  body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is kit daniels within full wars

[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:22.000]  well on friday the north korean communist dictatorships diplomat cancelled his space
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:29.200]  the un which was unheard of and then came back saturday uh and well why not just hear it directly
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:38.720]  from him what he said he tried to insult the supreme dignity of my country by referring it
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:48.400]  to a rocket by doing so however he committed an irreversible mistake of making our rockets visit
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:59.440]  to the entire u.s mainland inevitable all the more in case innocent lives of the u.s are harmed
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:07.760]  because of this suicide attack trump will be held totally responsible what else could be a bigger
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:16.160]  threat than the violent remarks such as pouring fire and fury total destruction coming from the
[1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:23.280]  top authority of the world's biggest nuclear power okay congressman former congressman medical
[1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:30.080]  doctor air force veteran uh ron paul was against the iraq wars he was against the afghanistan
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:34.720]  operations he's been against all of it he's been proven right his son and of course himself still
[1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:40.000]  in congress spearheaded exposing the fact that the west had backed al qaeda and then isis later
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:46.080]  and then trump rightfully picked up that gauntlet and took the baton forward and
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:51.040]  has helped clean up a lot of isis and kicked him out of syria to a great extent now would be the
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:56.320]  time to come home instead the neocons and others want to go into syria and kick out of sot himself
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.960]  ron paul is written extensively on that so is the von mis institute and the ron paul institute
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:08.320]  the stories posted on news wars dot com and info wars dot com ron paul how to end the korea crisis
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:19.040]  this is a complex issue but he's got a very well researched angle on it so i want to get his take
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:27.200]  thank you for joining us during this critical time thank you good to be with you now there's
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:31.760]  a delay today with our connection to you in houston but that's okay again just so folks know
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:41.280]  uh dr paul let's get into your plan to avert which could happen anytime uh causing a huge nuclear war
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:51.760]  well the sooner we get out of there the better you know we went into uh korea when i was in high
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:58.080]  school and it was totally illegal unconstitutional was done without the permission of the people
[1:10:58.080 --> 1:11:04.480]  who was done within a week after the civil war broke out in korea and uh some of my teachers never
[1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:10.080]  came home and ever since that time i've been saying why are we there what should we be there
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:15.200]  during all my campaigning especially the presidential campaigns i said just come home
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:19.120]  we've spent a trillion dollars over there that you know keeping them together and look at what's
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:25.520]  happened in vietnam we we finally lost in vietnam after 60 000 americans get killed and now we get
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:31.280]  along with them we don't need to be there we're just trying to provoke a problem and this this guy's
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:37.440]  nuts over there so why provoke them we don't we we are acting from a sense of insecurity that we
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:43.280]  have to say you know we're tough don't mess with us or we'll bomb you but that that to me is just
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.640]  sort of charity so the sooner we get out of there the better we've been there way too long
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:54.800]  and uh you know this whole idea the stage is set now that you know the koreans are threatening well
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.080]  we might shoot down an airplane well what if there's now that that stage is set it's progressing
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:04.320]  because of our involvement somebody's going to use a false flag and somebody's going to shoot
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:10.400]  down the airplane just so that this war gets started so that's why i believe in non-intervention
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:16.160]  we ought to defend this country but it's time to come home from korea you've lost too many lives
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:22.640]  we killed even when we got involved in that civil war you know with uh uh the north and the south
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:29.840]  uh we bombed the north to smithereens we killed 30 percent of their population and they had never
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:35.920]  attacked us we never declared war we went there under un banner we have an insane foreign policy
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:43.840]  and unfortunately it really hasn't changed that much with our new president dr ron paul is our
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:49.600]  guest we're talking about the north korea situation and obviously uh they're now sending bombers over
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:56.880]  the dmz big provocations we know a lot of ukrainian missiles that give them icbm capability have been
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:00.960]  shipped in smuggled into the north and when you talk about a false flag how do we know some major
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:06.720]  arms manufacturer or some other country doesn't smuggle a missile in like we saw in ukraine
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:12.960]  shoot down one of our bombers or try to shoot it down and then suddenly uh we're into a kinetic
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:19.440]  action a war starts the north uh then attacks the south soul with a hundred thousand pieces of artillery
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:23.760]  they've been threatening to detonate a hydrogen bomb above ground to attack tokyo we could very
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:28.000]  quickly get into a large nuclear war and a lot of people say well we can easily defeat north korea
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.920]  well of course we can but what happens if china or russia gets involved dr paul
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:48.320]  well they will get involved and uh you know when it started way back in the 50s we thought well
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:54.480]  we'll take care of this and a month after the war broke out uh you know we essentially won the war
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:58.800]  and then we moved up and decided well we'll occupy north korea went up to the border and
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:04.160]  the chinese came in sure they're going to be involved but i think you just made the case for
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:12.560]  why we need to be out of there uh because uh you know the north korea the guy is goofy but i'll tell
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:19.840]  you what he he does know what he's doing because he has to threaten because he's he he believes
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:25.360]  that if he gives up and capitulates and does exactly what we tell him to do that what will
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:31.600]  happen like what happened to saddam hussein what happened to qaddafi and uh and then how do how do
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:38.080]  we treat uh uh you know Assad in syria we have an empire to defend we run the world
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:44.240]  and it's wrong it doesn't work millions of people have died over this and it's time we as a people
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:49.280]  woke up and say we ought to mind our own business we ought to come home and defend this country
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:54.640]  we don't need to be worrying about you know battleships and bombers and flying back and
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:59.920]  showing that we have strength there are weapons that we're using world war two and this guy who
[1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:06.000]  runs north korea he's not going to invade united states he's not going to launch a missile just
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:13.040]  remember the whole thing dealing with iraq about all the danger great danger and the propagandist
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:18.320]  the deep state the media convinced the american people that saddam hussein was a danger they're
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:24.800]  doing the same thing now with north korea and that's why we ought to wise up and just not buy
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:32.560]  into this and uh and look at this as a constitutional issue and not to say well we need to go to war
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:38.800]  with this guy and unfortunately we're marching that way but we better look at ourselves too and why
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:46.480]  are we involved in 120 different countries with our military personnel and why are we always looking
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:53.040]  for trouble and uh i would say that it's very very dangerous but just to say well it was always
[1:15:53.040 --> 1:16:00.480]  saddam hussein's fault it was always qaddafi's fault it's always a sod's fault and then turn around
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:07.920]  and say oh yeah about look at russia look at what they're going to do i mean it is the neocon foreign
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:13.680]  policy that we have been following we still follow the neocon foreign policy i think that's tragic
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:19.680]  that said i agree with you in in practice and function but even people like joel scalzen that
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:24.720]  was agreed with you about not having a war uh you know in the last five or six saying they were
[1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:29.040]  frauds he says when you get down to north korea now they do have nuclear weapons they are being
[1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:34.640]  backed by china they are a real threat they are firing missiles right over japan now they can test
[1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:40.160]  weapons but but but doing it in this way threatening preemptively to blow up the us to say it's
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:47.280]  inevitable that's pointing a gun at us and really next level bravada it's incredible chicken and then
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:51.600]  you have the clinton's as you know transferring the reactors transferring the missiles in the
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:56.080]  mid 90s that you and others criticize when you first got back into congress and so there's a lot
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:00.880]  of blame going around here and then you just have the horrible little communist third generation
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:06.800]  dictator fat off the blood of his little skinny citizens i agree with you the poor you know korean
[1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:11.600]  and north korean slaves and their children i feel sorry for them i don't want to have to
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:17.280]  you know nuke the dmz uh but if they do strike us first i think they may be crazy enough to do it
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:21.840]  then it's going to take a major commitment to make sure they can't counter respond
[1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:24.800]  dr paul
[1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:34.240]  i you're buying you're buying into all the garbage that's passed out there by the deep state and
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:40.640]  neoconservatives and and the media my suggestion very clearly on what we should do is we should
[1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:45.600]  allow the south koreans to talk to the north korean what's wrong with that they're the ones
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:52.640]  that have everything at state and we don't even allow them to do that and uh and and yet they're
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:59.920]  willing to just uh last week the south koreans in an effort to break this conflict they sent a
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:04.560]  couple million dollars to north korea to take care of some of the people the kids that are
[1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:10.960]  suffering from our sanctions the people suffer we kill people we killed almost a million iraqis with
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:17.280]  our sanctions before we went to war and all these sanctions do is just provoke the bitterness we need
[1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:23.680]  to get allow why do we prohibit the south koreans from talking to the north korea we did that in
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:30.080]  vietnam and the french and americans did that in millions of me sure sure i mean it's like malin
[1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:34.240]  albright said a half million iraqi children is a good price to pay with the sanctions it's probably
[1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:40.400]  way over a million lands at british medical journals that was like 1.3 uh back in like 2007
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:47.440]  going back to 1990 and understand dr paul i'm just wargaming both sides of the debate i've not bought
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:52.800]  in to the garbage that we need to have a war or that sanctions are always the best thing
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:59.280]  as you said vietnam now loves us hates communist china becoming a free market powerhouse and we
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:03.200]  should have made a deal with ho chi men to go in there and be free market to begin with
[1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:09.600]  but we double crossed him tried to overthrow him as you know back in 1960 so i understand the history
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:13.760]  of it as you do as a former air force officer the only thing i'm getting at here is is that
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:19.920]  we can certainly recognize a communist regimes are also horrible evils just because we have neocon
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:25.760]  problems here i mean certainly uh this is a great example about communism's a horrible nightmare
[1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:38.080]  like venezuela let's skip this break i'll go ahead dr paul well i still think that you're seeing
[1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:45.360]  them as a much uh greater threat and when i was drafted in 1962 of the cuban crisis you know there
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:53.840]  was a a real hot cold war going on at the time but we we had danger then the soviet said 30 000
[1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:59.200]  nuclear missiles and weapons but we we didn't provoke or think it thought we had to get rid of
[1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:04.240]  them we actually dealt with them can't really talk to them and you know got rid of that crisis we
[1:20:04.240 --> 1:20:11.920]  had in cuba that north korea they they don't have this capability it's not china is not it is not
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:18.160]  interested in not in their interest to allow this guy to provoke and and get into a war with us so
[1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:23.360]  that that isn't that isn't quite accurate to say that they're in cahoots with china and they have
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:30.480]  nuclear bombs and and all this sort of thing and uh i i think that we should allow south korea to
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:36.320]  start having negotiations let let china and russia they're involved more they should be more involved
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:44.080]  in us let them uh monitor the car the wire we six seven thousand miles away once again we've been
[1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:50.800]  involved in a civil war that's been going on endlessly it's time we stopped it let's be clear
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:55.440]  i agree with you i have four children you've got a bunch of children you've got a bunch of grandchildren
[1:20:55.440 --> 1:21:00.400]  and great grandchildren i'm told now and i absolutely do not want to have a nuclear war i do not
[1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:09.200]  want this to happen i understand that what you're saying is historically true i'm simply pointing
[1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:16.000]  out that president trump has been right on so many other issues and i understand that it looks
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:22.800]  like there's been an escalation he believes that the strategic appeasement the strategic patience
[1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:28.240]  has run out uh and that he's looking for some other way to get north korea to come to the
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:34.080]  bargaining table hell months ago rex tellerson was saying let's have talks stop this rhetoric
[1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:38.960]  and it only seemed to encourage uh kim jong-un so i understand you can say we're ganging up on
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:44.160]  north korea and the people hurt are the poor folks in it that's true i'm not saying you're wrong
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:49.120]  but what about the dictators what about the horrible uh you know evil leaders of the nation
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:59.360]  what are we supposed to do about them what do we do well you're alex here you're alex you're
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:04.320]  speaking for the neoconservatives that's their line of talk of why we have to do this and i'm
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:09.280]  just arguing it's totally unnecessary didn't work you admit it didn't work in in vietnam
[1:22:09.280 --> 1:22:13.680]  and we should have done that definitely and we're friends with them we win more in peace than we do
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:20.800]  in war but we've been in korea this this whole thing is just uh based on a lot of misconceptions
[1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:27.120]  i think our administration has accepted neocon lies and they're going with it but they're and
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:32.640]  i agree with you get into trouble because of the diplomacy and the tone and all this but
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:36.080]  and i agree with you so in just a minute or two because i have a few other questions dealing with
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:41.520]  the economy and what's happening with all this nfl race baiting and the rest of culture wars
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:46.800]  what is your advice to president trump what is your advice to the president
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:55.840]  bring the troops home i would advise them just what my position has been for years
[1:22:55.840 --> 1:23:03.200]  get out of out of interventionism bring the troops home get out of all this me
[1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:10.000]  get out of the car out of syria out of iraq the whole works you know start dismantling
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:16.640]  our empire get all our troops out of korea and allow people to settle their own dispute
[1:23:16.640 --> 1:23:23.680]  but not to join this uh neocon effort to continue to run the world and distort the truth because
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:29.920]  they love the wars in the middle east and now the neocons are behind all this activity why we
[1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:36.880]  have this great enemy the the north koreans i think when we get so upset about that that we're
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:42.160]  insecure we act like a bunch of bullies we're insecure we don't know how to react and say
[1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:46.880]  oh they're coming they're going to colors and they're going to bomb us alex that is not true
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:54.640]  and the chinese are on that side of that issue at all they are holding holding him back if nothing
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:24:01.120]  else because they have too much to lose they they don't want any more war in north korea than we do
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:07.840]  though i don't really think it's right to say this guy in north korea is going to uh because he
[1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:13.280]  aligned with the chinese that they're going to help him you know provoke a war with united states
[1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:17.600]  just to be clear just to be clear their main trading partner is the chinese i'd love to see
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:23.840]  the two countries unified in this nightmare and uh i'm not going with that line i'm looking at both
[1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:29.040]  the lines of reasoning here just to play devil's advocate i overall agree with you and hope
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:33.360]  that's the way this goes but they do say they have hydrogen bombs it is believed they have them
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:38.240]  they're saying they'll preemptively use them so they're putting out horrible rhetoric as well
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.480]  i get your point that they need to look strong they saw what happened to iraq and other countries
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:47.440]  that didn't have nuclear weapons uh they look at uh you know iran looks at that so so moving away
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:51.520]  from that i think we actually agree on that subject and i pray everything turns out all right
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:56.640]  we've got your article posted on info wars dot com promoting that getting into the nfl thing we have
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:02.320]  the wiki licks it's george soros saying let's go to culture war even during the campaign promote
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:07.680]  racial division you have a black president you've got all these millionaire football players people
[1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:12.720]  are tuning out of the nfl and droves and they're only accelerating it as we see more and more
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:19.520]  wound up attacks on white churches whites are being killed in hate crimes uh and it's so fashionable
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:24.640]  to be anti-white and if you point that out all this anti-white racism they call us racists when
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:28.000]  everybody knows you and i and others have been calling for unity and you know really
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:32.480]  bringing the country together what is all this about where do you see this going what's going
[1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:43.520]  to end up happening dr paul well well i i think i think it is part of this uh cultural Marxism and
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:51.440]  you know attacking tradition and culture is part of their tool but when when you narrow it down to
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:57.440]  the uh through the demonstrations on the football field actually the answers are coming back pretty
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:03.280]  fast the people are disgusted with it and they're disgusted with the football players are disgusted
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:08.640]  with the owners they're starting to boycott i and i think that is very good i just think the president
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:15.280]  just you know be a lot less noisy about it you know threatening people uh you know that they're
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:22.800]  committing some crime no uh this can all be solved with a libertarian understanding of property uh what
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:28.320]  those ball players do uh is determined by the owners just as it would be in your studio or in
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:34.400]  your house or in my house uh it's the ownership so it has nothing to do with government and freedom
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:39.200]  of speech it has nothing to do with the first amendment and but it has a lot to do with what
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:44.960]  the cultural Marxists is trying trying to do but the people who condone this and encourage it and and
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:50.880]  expand this with the kneeling business i think i think that's dangerous but it's a reflection of
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:57.840]  the ownership that can be stopped immediately by just the owners saying no more that is it uh but if
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:04.160]  they condone it you can't write a law and you can't intimidate you can't say uh that's they're right
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:09.200]  under the first amendment no it has nothing to do with the first amendment i totally agree with you
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:14.800]  with what the owners are going to do with their property and the market will the market will answer
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:19.920]  the market will answer it's the boy conscious when he talks about having a rule it's his right to
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.160]  come out and say he thinks they're you know idiots or whatever but when he goes further he then
[1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:29.440]  starts encroaching on free speech i mean i think a lot of it's figurative but then how do the owners
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:33.520]  not let them do celebrations in the end zone even though they're hiking their leg peeing on the
[1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:39.200]  president uh symbolically how can they find them for that but not find them uh if they don't stand
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:44.400]  for the star spangled banner and and i get its free speech you shouldn't have to stand my point is
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:49.600]  there's this open globalist attack on america now and that's why i'm simply saying i have my free
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.640]  speech to say i am going to boycott the nfl forever what do you think dr paul
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:28:04.240]  that's the that's the answer that's the answer boy boycott them and if the if the owners want to
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:11.440]  act like jerks and prohibit one sort of expression of a political opinion and not the other one then
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:17.600]  they just dig a bigger hole for themselves and uh and i you know the other thing about this i need
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:24.240]  to get this in if possible you know it a lot of this got worse once the football team started
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:29.600]  taking money from the government to promote this this super nationalism and militarism
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:35.440]  because all of that military stuff they get a lot of money but that's to support the interventionist
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:40.560]  foreign policy and the military and the military can do no wrong it's support for the empire that
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:45.680]  is where the problem is and the american people should absolutely not allow our government to
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:51.280]  give one cent to the football and advertise there to promote the militarism of our government
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:56.080]  we only have 45 seconds real quick on the economy if we don't get the tax cuts paul ryan wants taxes
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:01.040]  to be raised now if we keep obama care most analysts say that will cause a new recession
[1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:06.000]  or depression and cause that big implosion you've been warning of 30 seconds on that dr paul
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:17.520]  final comments dr paul well it it looks bad i sure hope they can get i sure hope they can get
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:23.040]  the tax cut through if they blow that then we're really in trouble but it's not unusual to develop
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:29.600]  you know some of these welfare programs it's almost impossible to stop them and uh hopefully
[1:29:29.600 --> 1:29:36.160]  though we can compensate trump if i had to look for one thing he has set a he has set an atmosphere
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:41.920]  where there'll be less regulation if he can get a tax cut through that will be helpful but yes sir
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:49.280]  thank you dr paul thank you for all your time the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:08.560]  i came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient
[1:32:08.560 --> 1:32:14.800]  ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought
[1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:20.800]  out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to
[1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:27.920]  develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood

[1:33:07.280 --> 1:33:23.840]  john show
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:33.200]  yeah right now read your stone just talk to the house intelligence committee
[1:33:33.200 --> 1:33:40.800]  uh we had a very spirited exchange i had the opportunity to correct the record with congressman
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:48.960]  shift and congresswoman smear i mean spear uh as well as congressman swall well they conducted
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:57.680]  themselves in a uh in a polite and collegial way but they continue to insist that the russians
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:07.440]  hacked the dnc they actively disputed the uh notion published in the nation now
[1:34:09.120 --> 1:34:16.560]  this is very key because here is the takeaway the fbi director mr comey and the secretary of
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:27.760]  homeland security mr johnson both testified for this committee that the dnc did not allow the fbi
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:35.360]  to examine their servers mr shift intimated today that that was not the case and claimed
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:44.640]  that the dnc servers had been turned over to the fbi we've got to get to the bottom of that info

[1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:20.880]  that plus the exclusive transcript of his testimony and the exclusive video of him reading the

[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:39.840]  they have now officially said that i'm not under investigation and i'm not connected to russia they
[1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:44.960]  come out admitted and that drudge wasn't involved and shot down democrats further calls for criminal
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:52.320]  investigations what it is is bullying saying alex jones didn't kick our butt donald trump didn't
[1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:59.600]  kick our butt politically in the arena of ideas no no the russians did it you had the whole hollywood
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:06.000]  system everything but the kitchen sink thrown at the american reassurgence movement that's the
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:12.720]  opposite of races it's free market it's beautiful it's bold and they failed so they want to bring
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:18.080]  an authoritarianism claiming we're the outside force when they're the globalist protesting the flag
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:22.800]  trying to overthrow our borders and get rid of our sovereignty they're the foreign power they're
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:29.680]  the multinationals they're the enemy they're the establishment they're the opposition to us the resistance
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:37.040]  and they love playing games with words and trying to tell you they control words and control meaning
[1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:42.080]  we're not under your cult anymore and it's not because we're scared of your big fancy words
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:47.120]  you don't even know those words you read off teleprompters we are the future we are the cutting
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:54.800]  edge we are americana we are the renaissance we're the real liberals not you want to use those terms
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:59.120]  that's why they want to get rid of thomas jefferson because it was the revolutionary idea
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:04.400]  that he didn't realize in his lifetime but was realized later it's called being a visionary
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.520]  now joining us is roger stone then i'm going to get into these incredible nfl clips the booing of
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:17.760]  the cowboys all of it as ron paul just said boycotts the answer it's cultural marx's soul
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:25.680]  a linsky horse crap and it is blowing up in their stinking faces so get that video out we're
[1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:30.080]  gonna get that out the next 30 minutes in full wars dot com as well because it's not a this is
[1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:36.160]  not a spectator sport the fight against the globalist this is information warfare and our weapon is
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:40.320]  the truth our credibility is the truth and that's why they attack it because they know we told you
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:45.120]  about the nsa spy grid first they know that we told you about how trump was way ahead in the polls
[1:37:45.120 --> 1:37:50.720]  first and we told you he'd win and we told you everything because it's all there we told you
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:55.840]  the communist chinese fund via com and communist central you can watch it and see all the commie worship
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:02.880]  coming up alice jones doesn't like china but we do because you know we get out on our knees every day
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:07.520]  in front of the communist dictators and you know what we do don't you yes we you know don't we
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:15.120]  what what what trash what idiots you're gonna be just like the nfl i love it so twist all you want
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:19.760]  just like megan kelly had the worst ratings ever for the new show she took over all the critics
[1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:24.080]  say she bombed the new comedy central show bombed a lot of folks at comedy central behind the scenes
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.760]  said be nice you know come on this is years ago play ball with us and i said i don't want to play

[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:50.800]  to destroy you because you want to destroy us in america you understand that we're never going to stop
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:55.760]  we're never going to give in we're never going to back down we understand it we don't read off
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:00.240]  teleprompters we don't run around telling you how intellectual we are all day and and you know
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:07.600]  telling folks that we don't understand language or any of this garbage it's crazy we're changing
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:14.560]  the future we're making the world better we're winning you're losing all of you are jokes well
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:20.560]  alex don't pass some show that's based about you and plugs you every day i don't care i don't go to
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:25.440]  nfl games i don't want to go to hollywood i don't want to go to a list parties or fly off on private
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:31.840]  jets to the caribbean and you know sit there with empty-headed morons understand that i'm here to
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:39.440]  burn you down i'm here to route you out and i'm going to do it and i mean that information warfare
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:46.960]  wise roger stone you just came out of the big house intelligence committee hearing with lord shiff
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:54.400]  the the great perpetrator of bs and buffoonery and we've got the exclusive video of what you
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:40:02.480]  testified inside to upon info wars dot com tell us what happened well alex major major breaking
[1:40:02.480 --> 1:40:09.600]  news that will be heard first around the world here at info wars during my testimony when i
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:19.040]  said i did not believe that the russians had hacked the dnc and i cited the fact that the that dnc
[1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:28.320]  had refused to turn over their servers for examination to the fbi both congresswoman smear
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:38.240]  i mean spear uh and congressman shiff objected and said that in fact the dnc had turned over
[1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:46.880]  their server now in fact it was pointed out by trey gowdy at the republican member that both fbi
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:54.800]  director comey and homeland security secretary johnson came before this very committee and
[1:40:54.800 --> 1:41:04.800]  testified that the dnc had not turned over their server to the fbi so alex somebody's lying and
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:12.240]  we need to get to the bottom of who that somebody is somebody's committing perjury in camillot
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:19.120]  certainly appears that way although what's interesting is i have just heard as the witness
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:27.360]  i am subject to the laws regarding perjury but as the questioners if they lie well there's no
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:36.480]  penalty for that i corrected the record i made it very clear that there was no collusion by
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:43.200]  donald trump the trump campaign the trump family the trump friends the trump associates
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:51.200]  certainly nobody at info wars with the russian state i also made it clear that i did not know
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:57.200]  about the hacking of john podesta's email in advance contrary to what congressman
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:03.840]  shift said that i have never worked for the russian state contrary to what congressman
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:13.600]  congresswoman spire had said uh and that i had uh only confirmed what julian assigned himself had
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:19.680]  tweeted on july 21st sure we all understand that so so i've seen your prepared text how was shift
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:25.440]  and the other legion of doom uh members uh acting towards you because they always have this fake
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:31.840]  ravada on television how are they acting behind the scenes um they were weasels uh shift was
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:40.880]  particularly a weasel they were attempting to set several perjury traps uh they were unsuccessful
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:49.760]  they read back to me a number of my commentaries on info wars dot com uh trying to twist them to
[1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:57.360]  say that they said something they didn't so when i said on info wars that i had been in communications
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:03.920]  with assigns i also made it clear on info wars that that communications was indirect through
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:08.560]  an intermediary but the new york times was talking to him at the same time you're allowed to talk to
[1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:17.280]  people exactly the assigns isn't a russian agent uh they also could ask me if i had ever uh posted
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:24.800]  and then deleted a tweet uh i didn't recall that i had and then they showed me a tweet in which i had
[1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:32.080]  called uh some woman out pointing out that uh communications with assigns would be perfectly
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:41.280]  legal uh and then had subsequently deleted that because i had called her a stupid stupid word
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:49.360]  that rhymes with which and i thought better of it after i had posted it uh innocuous benign well i
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:54.480]  delete tweets all the time when i i'm i'm like sending a tweet at a red light and then i noticed i
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:59.280]  sent the wrong word out i mean i delete them all the time or that you misspell something of course
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:05.760]  it happens but be careful alex they may haul you before the committee explains your deleted tweets
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.240]  well i think it's fair to say this this this this whole russia gates winding down you predicted
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:15.520]  that six months ago they were then segway into financial crimes which they now they've basically
[1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:22.560]  admitted to so what's the next shoe to drop uh you know it's very hard to say they of course asked
[1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:29.440]  many many questions about paul manifold uh they asked many many questions about conversations
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:36.880]  that i've had with the president which i declined it to characterize to their chagrin it's not clear
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:44.800]  where they think they're going but we're going to have to resolve whether or not the dnc was hacked
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:50.320]  at all nevermind hacked by the russians and now suddenly the democrats are claiming they did
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:56.560]  turn over the server to the fbi that's just a serious discrepancy in the public record
[1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:04.640]  well roger another chapter is now opening and it's the battle for the republican party
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:12.960]  centered around this runoff for uh the nomination there in alabama for the senate seat of the now
[1:45:12.960 --> 1:45:19.120]  attorney general jeff sessions and we have bannon charging around exposing that the establishment is
[1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:25.120]  backing mr strange give us your approximation as a political operative on what's going on in trump
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:32.560]  landia uh is he still keeping the faith well i am completely at one with steve bannon we are both
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:40.400]  supporting the same candidate former judge roe more uh roe more ironically will be more loyal
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:48.880]  to the trump agenda than the candidate the president has been conned into supporting that would be
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:59.040]  looser strange so um things are kind of backwards there but a victory for more will be a victory
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:06.320]  for that trump agenda while a defeat for strange will unfortunately be a defeat for the president
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:14.640]  because i believe as steve does president was conned into supporting the establishment republican
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:19.680]  candidate so this is what we're supposed to do keep them honest take over the republican party
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:23.120]  in the internal documents of the republican and democratic parties as you know back during the
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:29.920]  last campaign the greatest fear is a libertarian insurrection an americana christian insurrection
[1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:35.280]  those three groups together all taking the republican party over and we're doing it and
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:40.640]  they're scared and i don't know how long the republican establishment the mitch mcconnell's
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:46.160]  the poll ryan's can hang on by the by their dear lives and that's why president trump should get
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:50.480]  behind this political move and i mean their political lives to go ahead and sweep them out
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:56.480]  and finally get the real trifecta in congress but i'm told the generals they even said this
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:02.000]  in the news are hopping mad why are they involved in domestic stuff uh telling bannon shut your
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:09.680]  mouth go away no info wars breitbart uh drudge report the liberty movement we brought the american
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:14.320]  people brought trump in and we're not going to just crawl off in the shadows now while you join
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:20.320]  with a bunch of blue blood trash and and rape this country go ahead roger i could not agree more
[1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:26.320]  alex the truth is that if you love darlin trump and trump revolution and you lived in alabama you
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:31.760]  could vote more or more not the candidate president got and you were saying that you were you were on
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:36.320]  the air months before trump endorsed him trying to get trump were you ever able that was always
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:42.320]  limited the stuff we get to talk about with him or others to to say you know early on we're talking
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:45.440]  to you saying as soon as the president calls me i don't think we can get into this you know i'm
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:50.560]  gonna really push uh you know you know judge more not this strange and then just i guess you didn't
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:54.320]  get the word to him or wasn't enough or what happened well i made the case in all honesty
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:48:00.800]  look like a ronald reagan he had two options one was going to have no one that's what every republican
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:07.040]  president in my lifetime has done in statewide primaries and campaign for the nominate or
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:11.920]  here was a golden opportunity in a special election to send a message to mitch mcconnell
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.960]  and paul ryan and the country called republican group and knifeing darlin trump in the back
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:22.240]  that we're not going to take their crap anymore he should have endorsed and instead he gave them
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.120]  what they want and then a month later mitch mcconnell wouldn't even return his phone calls
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:33.920]  an arrogant piece of trash no question and i what's the guarantee that senator strange will
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:39.600]  stand with us on uh obama well by the way they now admit that trump's giving strange very half-hearted
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.240]  endorsements and and and and and is really sabotaging him so i mean does trump know the
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:50.080]  error of his ways now i think he's figured it out but the moral of the story is don't take
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:56.240]  political advice from your liberal democratic son-in-law jerry kushner because that's who
[1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:03.280]  recommended the endorsement of mitch mcconnell's running dog lackey candidate looser strange
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:10.720]  all right info wars dot com roger stonestone cold truth dot com more exclusives coming

[1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:01.440]  up on news wars dot com and i had it somewhere in my stack if you guys will just print it for me
[1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:09.120]  again it's like an explosion of paper in here uh who is a west point graduate i guess for the army
[1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:14.640]  and he's got a hat saying communism will win and then open up a shirt and he's got a uh very very
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:21.600]  racist very very hateful che Guevara shirt che Guevara he said that only white people were good
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:25.840]  and that brown people were cockroaches he hated latin americans because they didn't want to go
[1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:29.920]  live in communal farms and he they wanted to keep their own property not have him be their slave
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:36.240]  master but this little arrogant social justice warrior uh signaling piece of crap uh calling
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:42.160]  himself commie bebop uh is right there letting everybody know that he likes an ideology that
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:48.080]  killed almost 200 million people and this he'll probably get awarded now you were enable intelligence
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.080]  didn't make an issue out of that running one of the biggest trump the grassroots groups president
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:56.000]  likes you tweet your stuff you broke a lot of big stories they kicked you out enable intelligence
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.480]  over that saying it's improper if the president supports someone in the armed services that's
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:05.680]  a sign they're not loyal because you're not a communist you don't want to kill 150 million people
[1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:09.200]  exactly so if you remember all during the election when i was doing the citizens for
[1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:13.520]  trump work i would come on here once in a while and that did i ever mention anything about my
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:17.280]  naval intelligence background or my history or anything to do with the intelligence community
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:22.480]  whatsoever no no i was here only in the perspective of i was talking about what was going on with
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:26.320]  the election what we were doing in the volunteer time uh all the different operations we were
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:31.440]  running to help the president win because we're americans we can do that under the constitution
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:36.160]  and i wanted to step forward from the shadows and do that because i felt like it was right for my
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:42.160]  country absolute crossroads shut i get shut down this guy who comes out and says he's a shaguavara
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:46.240]  terrorist uh and basically says he's a communist on cell on the side and if you look at some of
[1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:51.920]  the stuff that shaguavara did in the past i mean absolutely horrific brutality that was mass executions
[1:56:51.920 --> 1:56:57.760]  of men women and children and when you're in a member he called mexicans roaches roaches now i'm
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:01.600]  pretty sure uh i haven't checked no i was an avid guy i'm not an army guy i'm pretty sure that the
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:06.560]  shaguavara shirt is not army issue for the uniform fairly certain alex i don't know if you if you
[1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:12.000]  detect well you know he had higher ups uh egging him on yeah exactly so where is the slapdown on

[1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:36.480]  cases why hasn't there been anything on this guy but meanwhile you got a guy like me you got guys

[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:38.480]  banning i want to get into the fight for the heart solar republican party but

[2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:51.760]  look at the different fight the way it's lining up right now and then you mentioned the fight
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:00:56.640]  for the real heart and soul of the republican party that's going on not too far from where
[2:00:56.640 --> 2:01:03.200]  we sit right over in alabama the senate primary today big showdown between the establishment
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:08.400]  where trump has endorsed the establishment guy that's strange but now the every single other
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:14.960]  grassroots conservative patriotic uh uh trump supporter is behind this guy roymor
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:21.120]  and there's been five other congressional special elections that the democrats threw
[2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:25.520]  everything they had two to one five to one ten to one depending on the state spending
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:30.880]  and all the hardcore candidates won and then again as a bellwether saying everybody is
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:35.920]  certifying we want to keep trump we like it and then he does this and endorses an establishment
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:40.880]  guy trying to appease the republican establishment and then they would even return his phone calls
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:45.520]  after he capitulated yes well you got to ask what's the deal here what are we getting out of this
[2:01:45.520 --> 2:01:49.360]  what's trump getting out of this mcconnell isn't putting forward any of his bills they're putting
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:54.800]  forward these these uh piddly i'm sorry uh obama care repeal and replace bills but they can't even
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:01:58.160]  get passed because john mccain says he won't support it and when you look at the bill itself
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:01.840]  it's not really changing very much it says well it's not going to be obama care at the federal
[2:02:01.840 --> 2:02:05.360]  level but it'll be obama care at the state level it's like okay well it's still kind of obama
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:10.160]  care right um so why are we what exactly are we getting where's the wall where's the legislation
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:14.720]  for that where's the funding for it where are uh the major tax reform that we've talked about
[2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:20.080]  where's the infrastructure bills what exactly is the president getting for his agenda out of
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:23.680]  supporting with the strange meanwhile you got a guy like roymor who supports the president's
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:28.640]  agenda already this is jeff sessions's seat we can't have a squish in jeff sessions seat we don't
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:31.920]  want an establishment guy there you need a rock and watch the polling showing i've seen different
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:36.000]  numbers but you're more on top of this than i i mean what's it looking like right now neck and neck
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:43.280]  it's so honestly it and it's kind of a weird thing but actually after trump endorsed more more excuse
[2:02:43.280 --> 2:02:47.680]  me after trump endorsed strange more went up in the polls and people are actually saying well how
[2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:50.880]  that people are scratching their heads and they're saying the media couldn't figure it out they were
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:57.520]  saying why is more going up even though they had said 90 percent of people knew that trump had
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:01.200]  endorsed strange what it actually comes down to is they said look we like trump but we support
[2:03:01.200 --> 2:03:04.880]  the agenda and that's who more try it's not about the man it's about the mission it's about the
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:09.120]  culture exactly they said look we're not we don't support yeah we like trump because trump's our
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.560]  guy but that doesn't mean we're going to be in lockstep it's not a cult everything yeah it's not
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:18.160]  a cult that's they they just think that we're like them no we're not we're not trump lights we're
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:23.520]  americans right we're americans we're free thinkers and we can think to say well sir we respectfully
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:26.640]  disagree with you and we really like trump and we know he's for real he's already done so much but
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:30.880]  if somehow they get control and he goes sideways we'll throw him overboard and i think i think
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:36.080]  they're finding that out yeah they're realizing that maga is about make america great again and
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:40.480]  we're here for not make the republican blueblood's act like their patriots but continue their
[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:46.240]  degenerate agenda and the way the old dumb republicans bow the msm like it's so powerful
[2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:52.720]  and like oh they want its coveted endorsement it's a scarlet letter it's a big loser hung around your
[2:03:52.720 --> 2:03:59.280]  neck you don't want hollywood or comedy central or the nfl to like you you want them to hate you
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:03.200]  the thing i love about the comedy central show is they don't realize that the more and more they
[2:04:03.200 --> 2:04:08.160]  do that the more power they're giving to you the more power they're giving to our side because the
[2:04:08.160 --> 2:04:11.520]  more they're saying hey you need to pay attention to these guys oh we're just gonna laugh well they
[2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:15.120]  did it out of out of panic because nothing worked they already did the ignoring and everything else
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:20.160]  so now they want to miss brand who we are just hoping one of their bots kills us let's be clear
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:23.840]  this is about getting us killed they're listening to their mentally ill deranged crowds that are
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:29.920]  pissed go kill these people splc adl put making the lists putting up the it's go kill them yeah and
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:34.880]  and i don't think the host people reading on teleproposal understand the full you know multi-level
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:40.080]  psychological warfare operation they're running but that's what this is this is this is hate every
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.680]  couple days and other white church gets shot up more whites are getting killed they're starting
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:47.440]  a race war and then they're directing their people go kill alex jones go kill my love
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:51.440]  so
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:56.000]  a staunch anti-fetalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it would become a
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it but that it would
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  become a tool to destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:10.640]  you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great
[2:05:10.640 --> 2:05:15.760]  and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:20.800]  end of your government patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will
[2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:26.160]  be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything the
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:31.600]  government does at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy
[2:05:31.600 --> 2:05:36.000]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see later in life patrick kenry looked
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:40.640]  back and said when the american spirit was in its youth the language of america was different
[2:05:40.640 --> 2:05:46.800]  liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we
[2:05:46.800 --> 2:05:54.560]  should be demanding liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david night thousands of years ago there

[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:41.280]  statistics on average 10 to 1 black crime against white folks and i'm not bashing people most black
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:46.080]  folks aren't bad but the media says go out attack white people and it's happening like this white
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:51.200]  church got attacked over the weekend by a uh islamic invader from sudan and he sat on facebook i'm a
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:56.720]  muslim and i want to kill christians and white people and he came and he did it but you're not
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:09:04.000]  going to hear the nba coach popovich saying a word about that no no no white people need to be made
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:08.400]  to feel uncomfortable well i think they're getting made to feel uncomfortable when they get put in six
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:14.080]  feet under just randomly shot or black cops randomly shot just because they're cops by bom i
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:18.080]  pretty uncomfortable when you have to stand with armed guards outside of your church where you're
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:22.880]  trying to worship god we have i have a buddy who lives right outside a national right near where
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:27.920]  that church is they stand armed guard they take turns because they're worried that something
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:31.600]  like that could happen they take turns 20 minutes 30 minutes someone's and he would have killed a lot
[2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:36.640]  more people than you know nine folks he shot one dead if there wouldn't have been that security usher
[2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:41.520]  the usher's got to carry guns and they call us coops because we carry guns when you're all over tv
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:46.560]  saying go kill trump supporters and they're not even trump supporters just some white folks we're
[2:09:46.560 --> 2:09:51.200]  going to kill them and when that idiot in south carolina killed the nine black folks every white
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.080]  person in america was guilty but now when a black guy does it doesn't even make the news every bit as
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:10:00.880]  evil as dylan roof every bit is evil no national media not a word out of popovish because he
[2:10:00.880 --> 2:10:07.200]  converts you signal in san antonio and him and his players can feel sorry we're only making 20
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.240]  million a year coach and we'll have all the women throwing themselves at us and have helicopters
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:19.280]  eject america sucks only by two lamborghini's this year not three i wanted three that's right
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:26.480]  so let's go ahead and play this clip right now i got so upset i just unplugged my my headset's not
[2:10:26.480 --> 2:10:32.640]  working it doesn't matter here is the club it doesn't matter uh people have to be made to feel
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:39.680]  uncomfortable and especially white people because we're comfortable we still have no clue of what
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:48.080]  being born white means and if if you read some of the you know uh recent literature you'll realize
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:56.000]  it really is no such thing as whiteness uh but we kind of made it up uh that's not uh my original
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:11:07.760]  thought but it's true and it's hard to sit down and decide that yes it's like you're at the 50
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:14.160]  you know the 50 meter mark in 100 meter dash uh and you've got that kind of a lead yes because
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:22.960]  you were born white you have advantages that are systemically uh culturally psychologically
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:33.200]  there and they have been built up and cemented for hundreds of years it doesn't matter so jack
[2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:38.480]  but so but just next level and i've got like 20 similar clips and getting this stuff it's only
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:43.120]  going to get worse and worse where you just run i'm sorry i'm evil kill us stab us murder us white
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:47.840]  certainly evil you know you have like this head of the vaccine program in texas is out the event
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:51.600]  and she says we need to just kill all the white people and she's a white lady and it's in hillary
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:55.280]  well white people voted for trump they're the problem you know just the same white folks that
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:11:59.840]  voted for obama i mean it's just crazy where's this going and you realize that there are sources
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:04.640]  of information that are beyond what we're seeing on mainstream with the wherever this guy is drawing
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:09.280]  this stuff from there's no such thing as whiteness and and the whiteness have been oppressing people
[2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:13.360]  for years and it's systematic you're not hearing that on cina you're not hearing that for mainstream
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:19.600]  sources so there's other sources higher level stuff that's getting to this guy there's higher level
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:24.160]  uh uh sources that are being worked on on these people that are essentially trying to
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:28.400]  flame this up because they know that these people are influential they know they're influential
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:32.720]  because of their platforms through sports through entertainment through other parts of the media
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:38.240]  so that they can then push that message out and fan these flames of identity politics
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:43.360]  fan these flames of actual racism because they're looking to push forward this or they knew the
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:48.160]  russians talked about this in the back uh in the 1970s even before then they knew that america's
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:54.720]  fault lines were on race you fan those flames you tried to divide americans on those racial lines
[2:12:54.720 --> 2:12:59.280]  and you're just going to get chaos in the and the soviets would do it in latin america according
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:04.560]  to tribal lines or they would do it in ukraine according to orthodox versus catholic they would
[2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:10.400]  do it in the middle east chiite versus suny and they wrote big concordance uh documents on how to
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:15.520]  politically control it's called cultural marxism and it's being carried out and taught at colleges
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:21.600]  now and i just had ron paul on saying the nfl is cultural marxism but but notice they've invaded
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:26.240]  everywhere with politics beating us over the head don't they get we've developed an allergy
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:31.680]  that we're rejecting it that it's not working yeah that's what they don't get and that is the amazing
[2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:37.200]  thing about the american people is the fact that they know inherently they know inherently alex
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:41.280]  that you do stand up for the american flag you do stand up for the anthem you do stand up for your
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:47.120]  country well yeah we're not north korea it's our country we pay taxes to it it's our ancestors
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:53.200]  and it's what are we giving it up for globalism totally ruthless companies that literally own
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:58.960]  slave factories that are the worst the more liberal the company the more hellish their
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:04.400]  facilities are and we saw this under the obama administration him working closer and closer
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:09.200]  with the nfl they had the ravens were involved with the obama care rollout you think about this
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:14.880]  you know this is the obama vacation the globalist is george sorosization of the nfl and it's now
[2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:19.920]  used toilet paper yeah it's by design it's by design that they would use this because they
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:24.720]  know the power of the entertainment they knew the power of the celebrity the athlete is someone
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:28.480]  that you're going to listen to they used to do this with the rock singers during vietnam during
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:32.720]  all that time they used to do it with other uh other areas of entertainment now they're using
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:37.120]  it with athletes we're also see oh denny kimball john oliver all these guys are spouting off about
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:40.000]  well this is what we need for the fcc and this is what we need for net neutrality this is what we
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:44.320]  need for healthcare and suddenly say wait a minute let's be clear it comes directly out of the cia
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:48.880]  the ford foundation at the top there are good people inside government agencies that are fighting
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:53.440]  this that's what we're seeing is a deep state civil war but now they're activating the shadow
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:58.000]  government that is controlled by the bad guys that controls the deep state to try to bring in
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.400]  some type of hard coup against the president what do you think they're going to launch next i think
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:06.720]  we're going to see more of this we're going to see more people and over politicization of america
[2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:11.600]  we're going to see people outside of sports uh now this is leaking over to the end the baseball
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:14.960]  it's going to it's leaking over to hockey that's leaking over to nascar dale earnhardt jr said he
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:19.920]  wanted to be in solidarity with these guys and so people are going to because their bosses are
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:25.120]  saying conservatives won't punish you they don't care but liberals will love you virtue signal to
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:31.040]  them and then the mainstream media will say you're good no dale earnhardt jr you're an idiot you're
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:36.240]  going to be hated by your core fans forever and then the numbers show it but they're still committing
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:40.880]  political suicide why because it's a program because it's a program and they know that it's
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:45.520]  not they've been ordered overnight they know that it's it's condit it's a conditioning it's a nudging
[2:15:45.520 --> 2:15:50.720]  it's a force feeding it's then going to move to advertisers look for coca-cola look for pepsi look
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:56.560]  for these big major ad to give them major endorsements it's a payoff to start to go for all of this
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:01.840]  take the run that take the one army ranger veteran um i want to say his name down because i know
[2:16:01.840 --> 2:16:07.040]  disgrace his family he was wonderful getting up during the anthem and saying i might be part of this
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:10.960]  and then they basically threatened to fire him he now says he's ashamed he agrees with it all
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:16.960]  basically you know america's bad stick with the players so it shows the the bullying of this cult
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:21.200]  hey you talk about north korea this is like a video that north korea would make somebody
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.360]  like uh like that student or somebody else give after you've been kidnapped by north korea that
[2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:29.520]  didn't say exactly you knew what he that guy was doing you could see in his eyes that he was standing
[2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:33.680]  for his country he was standing for the fallen soldiers that he served with wounded veterans he
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:37.200]  talked about that's why they told him your five million dollar your contracts over unless you
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:41.200]  get out there and say piss on america and that that reminded me of something that you'd see
[2:16:41.200 --> 2:16:46.080]  go back we've talked about this before alex chinese cultural revolution this is exactly
[2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:51.440]  what they mean when you go to the universities they say we're executing the mal model that's
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:56.960]  what the fort foundation is executing of all the communist flavors that's what we're having executed
[2:16:56.960 --> 2:17:02.480]  with the chai comms rolling in with funding of all six major movie production companies
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:07.120]  as the actual funding is even coming from china a lot of this is over a lot of people see this
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:11.520]  hollywood movies today and for the past ten years it's been ratcheting up and ratcheting up
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:16.400]  it's always china and suddenly china is more helpful in in the films and then you're seeing too
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:21.680]  what if you go back look and study the chinese cultural revolution these ideas of toppling
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:26.320]  your monuments destroying your own history history doesn't matter because we have progress now
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:31.360]  we don't need history anymore because we're better we're more uh self effectuated self
[2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:35.840]  accentuated whatever that means post modernism and then if anyone steps out of that if anyone
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:40.880]  steps out of line you have to self-recriminate you have to go stand before everyone and apologize
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:44.800]  and that's the thing it starts with you going in the colleges and then the churches and then your
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:49.440]  homes then they shut down the churches saying i'm bad i did this it's true and then once they get
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:55.680]  the whites doing it everyone's gonna have to go say what they've done and then oh bob had to be taken
[2:17:55.680 --> 2:18:03.040]  away for reeducation and what do they say 2010 army dot mill document they've set up mass internment
[2:18:03.040 --> 2:18:09.360]  facilities and they use the term reeducation camp that is the soviet and slash communist chinese name
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:15.760]  i'm not calling it internment camp excuse me reeducation camp they call it reeducation camp
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:23.280]  they even use the tainted name to rub it in they know what they're doing they know what the program
[2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:28.400]  they're running a conny takeover they know exactly it's paint by numbers this came from stalin then
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:34.400]  it went to mao mao really was the one that got the cultural understanding of this underway because
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:38.800]  in the soviet union a lot of this was already destroyed from all of the wars that happened
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:43.280]  from world war one world war two the bolshevik revolution but it was mao who had to go in in
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:48.720]  peacetime alex and that's key in peacetime they had to foment these ideas and they use the youth
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:52.320]  he said your parents are idiots you're in charge and then they had the kids to show themselves
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:58.080]  killing their mothers and fathers in the square students rising up going after their principles
[2:18:58.080 --> 2:19:01.600]  going after and look when you're a kid of course you're you're going to be anti principal anti
[2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.840]  your teacher of course you're going to want to go after them but what mao did was take that natural
[2:19:05.840 --> 2:19:11.600]  rebelliousness of new youth and put weapons in their hands and say that if you do this if you
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:17.840]  rise up the government will be behind you and that's what happens when they oh conservatives
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:22.320]  can't have any speeches now at berkeley oh but the anti-racist they can and what do they do beat up
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:27.280]  our reporters attack their car just covering them we're god we're violent we'll go to your church

[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.760]  program they want to break our will they know it's unpopular now but they believe that they're
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:45.360]  sociopathically on the right course they want to be part of the big social engineer team they don't
[2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:51.680]  get there's a civil war and we're rejecting them and irrevocable lines are being drawn here but
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:58.000]  let's play this clip of the entire dallas cowboys team takes a knee protesting the national anthem
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:03.600]  20 years ago 30 years you would laugh you'd think martian's had taken over but this is what it is
[2:25:03.600 --> 2:25:08.800]  the full assault on america that was meant to totally happen this year but patriots got trump
[2:25:08.800 --> 2:25:13.760]  in so now it's a train wreck but they're still executing their operation here's that club she
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:19.360]  said the cowboys players wanted to show unity but they were very adamant about wanting to separate
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:26.480]  that message from the national anthem john all right listen as they take a knee collectively
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:35.360]  booze can be heard from this sellout crowd in arizona jerry jones is just a shameful person
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:40.400]  that was my grandfather's name jerry jones uh a very shameful person that that smile that little
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:44.720]  smirk on his face he knows what he's doing and symbols mean things alex we're talking about this
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:50.880]  in the context of an overall program they're kneeling they're kneeling submitting reflecting
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:56.480]  submitting what is you look up and you guys pull up uh kneel to zod from superman two please cal
[2:25:56.480 --> 2:26:03.200]  son of jor-el kneel kneel before zod exactly it's it's supplication and so it's it's not like
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:06.960]  oh we're kneeling to protest no no no no we know what you guys are doing we know what you're kneeling
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:11.920]  symbols mean things and so my as my question to them would be it means kneel and give up your
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:16.000]  country right kneel and let us conquer you who are you oh we're the globalists that run slave
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:21.520]  factories and fun radical islam and are totally cold-blooded we're we're bono that gives less than
[2:26:21.520 --> 2:26:25.760]  one percent of the money he gets from charity to black africans but it's okay because again they're
[2:26:25.760 --> 2:26:31.360]  liberal jack hey because they want you to submit they want you to actually actually the word of
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:36.080]  the word islam actually means submit to submit to god so this idea of submission kneel get on your
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:40.480]  face yeah get down get down that's what they do they need five times a day they kneel down and that's
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:44.320]  and that's in terms of so we're getting the nf on everybody you should they only kneel once a day
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:50.320]  now but now you kneel to the mainstream media whatever you say oh yes america's bad we hate

[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:25.840]  always said it would come from within and settling at west point they're pulling their
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:29.920]  outfits off when we're communists were taken over and the and the and their officers are like good

[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:30.720]  make no mistake it's in the wiki leaks even before hillary lost they said we're losing the public
[2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:36.720]  isn't listening anymore we need to divide them we need to control them and keep them under our
[2:33:36.720 --> 2:33:42.400]  control to keep them helpless and in the dark and hillier responds this was in the news she says
[2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:47.360]  i'm so sick of these baristas living in their mother's basements what do they expect from me
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:54.800]  free health care it's impossible and they respond back we recommend expansion of culture war
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:00.720]  that means race war men against women left against right and that's what they're doing
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:08.800]  with the nfl bought and paid for now with globalist foundation money to do all this kneeling
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:15.680]  garbage that's why the owners are behind it that's why the teams are behind it it's why the commissioner
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:20.080]  when trump said on friday he said you disrespect our flag you get off the field you son of a
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:29.280]  bitch you're fired he said no mr president you disrespect the nfl that's the arrogance in the
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:36.400]  weird sycophant area of where people just worship these roi head cokehead uh players and the decadent
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:42.080]  stupid owners they've gotten so disconnected they think they're america so the globalist captured
[2:34:42.080 --> 2:34:47.920]  them and now for the last six seven years it took obama a few years you suddenly saw anti gun
[2:34:47.920 --> 2:34:53.680]  anti family anti america and and and the ads and the corporations it's the corporate money the
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:59.360]  sponsorship money as you said earlier jack was so big is linked up to totally and absolutely
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:05.440]  control this and that's why because these people are mercenaries to sell their country out that's
[2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:10.240]  why they're doing it not for solidarity not because they're against racism no they know it's a bunch
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:15.680]  of hype they've been told to do it for sponsorships they know and they looked at this you know pepsi we
[2:35:15.680 --> 2:35:22.080]  remember pepsi the change ads the hope ads that were run those were obama ads masquerading as pepsi
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:26.800]  ads because that's the way marketing works my marketing is a psychological operation when it
[2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:31.120]  comes down to it when it comes they are trying to get you to buy a product but in this case what
[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:36.000]  they're doing is they've they've used that same information those same tactics they're marketing
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:40.880]  now political ideas they're marketing we should be on obama's side they use those words we know
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:44.640]  those are obama words but we're going to match up with a pepsi product and then so every now that
[2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:49.840]  that link is made in your mind every time you see that pepsi can you're linked with obama every time
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:54.080]  you see it now it's linked with nfl and now it's all it's subliminal yeah it's completely and and
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:58.480]  they admitted it was i mean here's an example it's like six seven super bowls ago they had the green
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:02.640]  police out he adds the show people being arrested for hot tubs because it takes too much energy
[2:36:02.640 --> 2:36:07.040]  arrested for batteries light bulbs but a guy in an Audi gets to go around the checkpoint
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:12.080]  the police state internal checkpoint because he has an Audi he's socially cool i said that was
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:16.560]  paid for i guarantee you by a big foundation because the even the green police uniforms were
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:22.400]  the real ones i've seen from canada to australia to the us rolling out local federal doesn't matter
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:27.600]  white top green pants they later admitted a month later in the san francisco chronicle that it was
[2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:33.600]  paid by a consortium of government and other think tanks to prepare people for the real rollout
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:39.120]  that's what's and it was done on the nfl and the people understand our super bowl ads those cost a
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:43.840]  little bit of money those are not cheap ads that is not cheap average ads are about two million yeah
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:47.840]  that is the most expensive like five million to everyone you're going to have yeah exactly so
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:52.000]  they know and they also know that they're getting their value for it so there's going to be the most
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:56.240]  amount of messaging the most amount of programming the most amount of money and if you want to know
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:37:01.200]  what the elite want you want to hear their mouth watch the nfl and it's we hate america we hate the
[2:37:01.200 --> 2:37:06.720]  flag we hate the veterans we want your guns we hate families i think it was last year or two years
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:12.160]  ago and they when they came out and said this is an anti-police halftime show it was the when
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:16.400]  bayancy was doing yeah it was and it was just yeah we're gonna and then she did simulated rioting
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:20.880]  and again the police aren't perfect like anybody but they're making the revolution about overthrowing
[2:37:20.880 --> 2:37:26.400]  local government that's a communist takeover if people like alex used to be anti-corruption
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:30.480]  because i wanted to save the police and not have to be tools of the globalist i wanted them to be
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:34.800]  awake and you know what they are on average and that's why the globalists are screwed right and
[2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:39.440]  alsharpton even came out and admitted that he said a lot of this is because we want a national
[2:37:39.440 --> 2:37:42.800]  police he said we're going to federalize it that effect federal you can search it and he goes
[2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:45.840]  we're doing all this because we're going to federalize the police and they came out with a
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:51.840]  strong cities initiative who would sit over that federal board the un precisely so all of this was
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:55.360]  going and you could read the tea leaves and see like why are they going against police and then
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:58.880]  you saw when they said oh they're militarizing the police they're getting military equipment and you
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:04.000]  realized that they were going after local police and if you if you pick up that one piece of information
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.160]  that was the thread and then you could tie it back to and you want to bully the locals into going
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:12.480]  federal because the globalists have taken over the feds then if the feds take over the locals you
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:18.480]  have total control and suddenly you have a national internal paramilitary force that's right so you
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:24.080]  put it in those getting orders from the un with loretta lynch giving speeches saying right so you
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:28.160]  put it in those words and they say oh oh you're you're you're just you're just conspirators you're
[2:38:28.160 --> 2:38:31.920]  crazy no wait that is what you exactly said that is what you're doing and the only reason the
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:35.840]  intelligence agencies turned against hillary at the grassroots and middle levels was because they
[2:38:35.840 --> 2:38:40.240]  were being briefed on the internment camps and the reeducation centers and on the communism
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:45.600]  and on all this and arresting governors and having a one-party state and they said this is crazy
[2:38:45.600 --> 2:38:51.440]  yeah everything alex jones said for 20 years or ron paul says true and i'm not bragging but we
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:56.160]  read the enemy's attack plan it sounded crazy because it is but when they actually tried it
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.080]  it didn't it didn't work and now they're never going to get away with this now you've got those two
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:04.160]  levels and obviously i can't speak in it into classified on this but you've got essentially
[2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:08.800]  two levels where there's the political appointee level in the intelligence community the dni the
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:13.680]  clapper level right and then you've got the rank and file the members the people that signed up
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:18.800]  that choose to live their lives in secret because they love their country and they want to do the
[2:39:18.800 --> 2:39:23.120]  right thing for the american people so when they see stuff that's going on that they don't like
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:27.840]  when they see stuff that they get fed up with you better believe they're going to do something about
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:33.280]  it as best they can and so that is where the big divide that's the civil war inside the deep state
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:37.600]  right and so that's what they saw with a lot of people they said oh look at this guy you know
[2:39:37.600 --> 2:39:40.640]  when snowden came out well he's a trader or many come out he's a trader but then you'd have other
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:45.440]  people say wait a minute i didn't know we did that wait wait this program can can we were looking
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:49.200]  into people's phones we're looking into we're collecting that metadata this metadata but
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:52.800]  they didn't do anything wrong why do we don't have a warrant against them but it's a complete and
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:58.880]  it's political so then you're realizing that their own training their own indoctrination their own
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:04.320]  programming is telling them to not do the things but under obama they put in people like reality
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:08.400]  winner that was trying to join ices and ate it all whites she was white this guy at west point
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:13.280]  saying i'm a communist we're going to take over and overthrow you at the graduation they've put
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:20.080]  their people in i mean how what how deep is the penetration it's part of it is penetration from the
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:24.720]  political level so it's going to stay up there but it's this ideology that gets in there it's
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:29.920]  it's a mind virus alex you know this and it's having people in there that already believe
[2:40:29.920 --> 2:40:33.280]  because they're listening to your liberal podcast you're listening to this alt left stuff you're
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:36.800]  listening to these crazy russian conspiracy theories and reality winner that's exactly who
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:42.640]  she was she was somebody who bought into all of that so she decided to break the law in order to
[2:40:42.640 --> 2:40:46.480]  help what she thought was the resistance but actually she was helping the establishment
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:52.720]  she wanted to help isis as a woman as a feminist i mean shea guvara said mexicans were quote
[2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:57.040]  roaches because they didn't want to live collectively and then let him be their boss he
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:01.600]  was a super racist a-hole i mean people don't know who are here in america just think whites the
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:05.680]  only people that were ever class driven it's the same way all over the world in in primitive systems
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:11.840]  latin america is completely cast oriented about your skin color and multiple levels on five hundred
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:16.960]  years of people not interbreeding you know with the natives hey my my dad's family did and i'm
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:21.680]  virtue signaling it's true i'm proud of some of my native american history but i'm proud of my european
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:26.400]  history as well this is the mental illness white people do what everybody else has done right and
[2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:31.600]  that is and that's to get you to have to say to have to come out there and say well this is what my
[2:41:31.600 --> 2:41:36.080]  background is and i'm able to talk on these issues because of the why are we even talking about this
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:40.640]  alex whatever happened to uh let's not judge people by the color of their skin by the content of
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:45.680]  their character whatever happened to that line well they knew that that line was was not helpful
[2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:50.240]  to their program they knew that that line wasn't helpful to fomenting this type of anger and division
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:54.720]  and friction in the country and so they turned it around and suddenly made people have to self
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:41:59.040]  discriminate there's there were people who came out um there was an article i can't remember exactly
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:02.240]  where it was but this woman said was writing it up and she was african-american then she found out
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:07.440]  that she was part irish so she found and she said oh my goodness i can't believe that i'm part irish
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:11.920]  and i had to come to terms with what i've done and suddenly so wait a minute whatever happened to
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:16.640]  individual he's he's a he's a human now she's guilty because irish might have had some slaves
[2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:23.040]  when per capita irish were the slaves you dumbass right so most the sharecroppers were irish yeah you
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:27.760]  saw the irish retreat and the difference was treated oh my god yeah it's exactly these people
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.080]  are just and now they're taking down the lynch name which is irish everywhere calling it racist
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:36.880]  yeah they're calling that race it is an irish name comes from an irish lord that's where lynchings
[2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:40.800]  come from the name lynch but we can't have the order does that does that count for loretta
[2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:45.840]  relinch does she have to come down it just shows the total mental illness now speaking of bowing to
[2:42:45.840 --> 2:42:51.040]  the system as myself and and jack suburb just pointed out earlier when you're bowing down
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:57.200]  who's giving them the cultural orders the msnbc the cnn's well who loads their teleprompters the cia
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:01.760]  the ford foundation the cardigan foundation george soros funds everything from the huffington post
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:08.880]  to msnbc to you name it to the london guardian they're putting out the message neil now during
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:14.960]  the ritual of america the star spangled banner the hand over the chest don't have to do it if you want
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:19.360]  but we're going to focus on these spoil rotten players doing it and then now the owners everyone
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:24.640]  else doing it in defiance of the president that's saying it's wrong and disrespectful to the veterans
[2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:30.960]  in the country and why do you want to be here this reminds me of superman superman too when zod
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:36.400]  comes into the white house and is saying everybody kneel to zod because once you kneel virtue signaling
[2:43:36.400 --> 2:43:40.480]  you're not racist because everyone's been beating you over the head with this made up guilt once you
[2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:45.920]  now you'll kneel every time and then now you'll call out your neighbors call out your friends
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:51.120]  this is cultural marxism again right out of the old malice system so let's go ahead and play this
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:44:02.720]  clip and then dovetail it with the cowboys last night who he thinks is the president you are not
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:09.760]  the president no one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly i'm the man they're
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:19.840]  protecting i'm the president i'll kneel before you if it will save lives it will starting with your
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:29.920]  right
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:40.160]  what i do now i do for the sake of the people of the world but there is one man here on earth
[2:44:40.160 --> 2:44:50.240]  who will never kneel before you who is the symbols i wish i knew
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:58.800]  superman will save us the cowboys players wanted to show unity but they were very adamant about
[2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:03.920]  wanting to separate that message from the national anthem they still got boot it's the same deal
[2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:11.520]  like a half as they take any collectively booze can be heard from this sellout crowd in arizona
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:21.520]  wow you know how all this happened they were blackmailing them over buying the college athletes
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:27.280]  they were blackmailing the obama just department how they were paying folks to illegally spear people
[2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:31.040]  and and take key players out of the game it is editorial let's not lie about what it is they
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:35.840]  were breaking the rules and also the concussions so the government spiked all those investigations
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:41.040]  about six seven years ago they peaked it and they took over the jewel of propaganda the nfl
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:48.400]  at which when who was alex if you remember the special counsel that they brought in to investigate
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:56.560]  the nfl who totally cleared roger gendell what was his name oh it was robert muhler the very same
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:46:02.000]  robert muhler who is now brought in again to investigate as a special counsel of the president
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:07.680]  the exact the very same man the and it was the fbi director from before him who they brought in
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:12.400]  to penn state to cover up that old pedophile ring but tell them but but no the deep state isn't real
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:16.160]  but no tell me the deep state isn't real when you say they came in and said there's a we know
[2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:22.480]  your again we know you're cheating in key plays with vegas that's billions we know you're rigging
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:28.240]  some games mainly plays it's hard to rig the whole nfl and we're going to bust you on that and that's
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:34.640]  why just like jagger hoover and other directors said until the mid fifties there is no such thing
[2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:40.480]  as lakosa nostra or our thing or the mafia because the italian mafia was paying him off right because
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:44.080]  they knew that if they were putting that up that this was when whitey bolger was in there when
[2:46:44.080 --> 2:46:49.520]  they supported whitey bolger taking out all the other families the fbi helped different parts of
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:46:53.200]  the mob to go after other parts of the mob so essentially the fbi was in the mob business at
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:58.160]  that point and they now admit i mean i remember covering it six seven eight years ago the cia
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:02.560]  was taking out four of the five cartels where they're basically only one left and then they make a
[2:47:02.560 --> 2:47:10.800]  whole movie with real people i mean that movie sakaro that means assassin that that's a really
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:16.000]  true story and i even know people that were there involved all that stuff i mean that was all that
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.800]  whole story really happened that that's just one little snapshot of the cia and they make a movie
[2:47:23.520 --> 2:47:28.480]  with hollywood stars showing you what exists that the net movie basically happened just as they show
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:32.560]  it i can't believe that movie got made and you notice that well once that movie came out nobody
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:36.720]  was talking about they weren't getting major awards it wasn't getting played again it wasn't
[2:47:36.720 --> 2:47:40.800]  no nobody really talks about it sits there but i've talked to people in the special forces community
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:45.040]  i've talked to people in the intelligent community that say yeah this is true this is exactly what we
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:50.480]  do it's a war that's going on right there on the border and no one's talking about it and this is
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:56.320]  that particular story isn't just a composite that's a one of the things that happened right
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:48:01.200]  because they knew the cia and this is what they always do it's it's it's it's part and parcel uh
[2:48:01.200 --> 2:48:06.880]  to varsity cons race of what they've been doing since the 50s even before then is to say they look
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:11.440]  at the cartels alex as a regime they look at that at the cartel because they know who's really in
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:14.640]  charge they see it as a government right they see it and they say we're going to just be working with
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:20.000]  one government or maybe two to play them off against each other if we need to and there you go so all
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.480]  we need to do is get the one that's willing to be in bed with us and and what did bannon say he
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:28.400]  said they sold our jobs and brought in the drugs he's telling everybody in alabama the government
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:32.480]  brings in the drugs we're going to stop it that's what trump's doing that he's they're actually
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:36.480]  wiping out all the little distribution cartels they're wiping out the mexican mafia they're
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:41.680]  i mean they're just getting killed right now they're all being just stacked up thrown in the river
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:45.360]  they've got to go after the sinaloa's they've got to go after the zetas there are places in
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:50.640]  mexico alex where the cartel and again obama and the globalists did that on purpose if they knew
[2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:54.160]  trump's doing mexico a favor actually shutting it down he says we're not going to have that
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:58.960]  disorder up here you think they're not going to have a narco state america kill them all you think
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:03.920]  they want to be living in a mexico in a mexican narco state no that's what juliani said he had
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:08.480]  the hat it said make america make mexico great again also why shouldn't we we don't want a failed
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:14.400]  state like samalia on our southern no we want a prosperous and trump's seeing the actuaries that
[2:49:14.400 --> 2:49:18.480]  if you actually boost our wages it's going to boost mexican wages just like ross perot said
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:23.280]  i don't trump's the best friend the mexicans ever had i'm telling you right now but they're
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:26.480]  trying to stop him we're going to go to break jack continue on a little bit with but i want to take

[2:55:42.640 --> 2:55:47.440]  we've got big national polls out where the vast majority of americans depending on the poll
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:55.040]  65 to almost 75 or 80 percent depending on the poll you look at say that they are just totally
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:56:00.080]  against the nfl including black folks hispanic you name it they're just turning everything into a
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:06.160]  drama party you want to watch an nfl game where it's like 90 black guys anyways getting paid on

[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:15.680]  bitching all day and statistically cops kill 200 something black people a year most of it
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:19.920]  justified i'm not defending the cops but there there's some bad shootings cops do but it's
[2:56:19.920 --> 2:56:24.640]  the number one issue in the world it's a diversion on how we're all having our america stolen and
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:29.440]  the globalists want us to fight with each other while they do it jack kneeling down i really
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:33.680]  like focusing on this topic i think it's very important the actual optics of kneeling because
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:39.680]  it's not an american thing as you know they used to kneel to the kings and queens right that was
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:43.680]  the british that was the monarchy that's who you knelt to that's who genuflected to when
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:48.320]  george washington became president he never said kneel he said you stand you shake my hand i'm
[2:56:48.320 --> 2:56:54.480]  going to be mr president not your excellency not your your grandpoobah whatever you it's just
[2:56:54.480 --> 2:57:00.640]  mr president shake my hand very nice to meet you and so kneeling down uh basically genuflecting
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:06.560]  giving supplication to something this is not an american thing to do it the only time you'll
[2:57:06.560 --> 2:57:10.320]  really see americans do this is when they're praying when they're when there's prayer involved
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:14.560]  where um when you're pray praising god when you're doing something like that it has nothing to do
[2:57:14.560 --> 2:57:19.040]  with politics so entering this this genuflection they say that we must you must genuflect it's
[2:57:19.040 --> 2:57:26.480]  classic soviet countdown where you go into the group community and do this and then say you're
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:31.120]  guilty right and so now you're all of your recriminations are coming forward all of your
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:36.080]  doing is you're saying that this is this has power over me you're saying the state is god you're
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:40.480]  supposed to get on your knees at midnight or in the early morning when you're and until god you
[2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:45.440]  repent of things you've done you don't tell in a football stadium mainstream media you're my god
[2:57:45.440 --> 2:57:50.960]  i'm bad tell me what to do that is sick and you realize they're not they're not taking a knee to
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:56.800]  trump so i'd love to talk to any one of these guys say who are you taking a knee to who specifically
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:58:01.040]  are you do you have in mind when you're taking that knee they're kneeling to political correctness
[2:58:01.040 --> 2:58:04.800]  and hating white people that's what it's all it is they're kneeling to white genocide and they
[2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:09.120]  won't admit it and then i'm not i don't want anybody to be genocided but everywhere it's kill
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:12.800]  the whites kill the whites the universities no whites can come on campus whites it's a bunch

[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:07.360]  and show his face i can't believe that he didn't cut that out because it's it's because he's protected
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:11.360]  that they're because he's they're probably more of them than our us and it's also the narcissism of
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:16.560]  it it's it's that self-actualization of narcissism of saying look how strong i am i'm gonna write on
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:23.440]  the little marker on the inside boy wasn't uh mccarthy proven right yeah just mccarthy i mean
[3:03:23.440 --> 3:03:26.960]  he called he said all those years ago he said we're gonna we're having communist infiltrate
[3:03:26.960 --> 3:03:30.720]  they're gonna he said it's out he said it they've even got our army he says in the army they're
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:34.720]  getting into the military and they looked at this and then we were told oh he's just crazy so the
[3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:39.520]  army specifically but he specifically said the army he specifically said to look out for this
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:44.080]  stuff so what happens keep in mind now what happens if mccarthy was right and those people that got
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:50.160]  in in those years years ago are now the ones at the higher levels in the army are now the ones
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:58.960]  that are calling the shots think about that look at this punk coming yet you know what it is winning
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:03.200]  over the people of north korea and china that live in slave factories it is winning over the human
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:07.360]  spirit you know north korea is going to be using this north korea is going to put this out in the
[3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:12.800]  next propaganda message oh say look we've got we've got communists on animal anymore man they're not

[3:04:17.120 --> 3:04:23.040]  killing people when are they going to start getting taught some lessons i'm serious man i did he's in
[3:04:23.040 --> 3:04:26.480]  our military and our one of our most elite universities telling us he's going to kill us
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:32.880]  it's a clear and present danger yeah there's his twitter account oh wow oh and he's into grant he
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:39.200]  wants to burn oh yeah he's a anti-southern or on top of it good god this guy's such a piece of crap

[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:53.760]  joe vicks here with info wars dot com today i want to talk to you about guns why we have them why the
[3:04:53.760 --> 3:04:59.520]  bill of rights guarantees that we can have them and why my right to have a gun is more important
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:04.880]  than your right to rail against it in the press i believe every good journalist needs to know why
[3:05:04.880 --> 3:05:09.920]  the second amendment must be considered more essential than the first amendment this may be
[3:05:09.920 --> 3:05:16.400]  a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated dusty idea some
[3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:22.720]  old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats no it is just as essential to liberty today
[3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:29.200]  as it was in 1776 the original amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contain 10 of what the
[3:05:29.200 --> 3:05:35.280]  constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of rights came to us with blinders on
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:41.440]  it doesn't recognize color or class or wealth it protects not just the rights of actors or editors
[3:05:41.440 --> 3:05:47.760]  or reporters but extends even to those we love to hate this is a small excerpt from trawlton heston
[3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:52.800]  we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[3:05:52.800 --> 3:05:57.920]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify
[3:05:57.920 --> 3:06:03.520]  the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's
[3:06:03.520 --> 3:06:09.200]  made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with

[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:17.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:27.680]  right and wrong a new world order now there's an article up on info wars dot com
[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:33.520]  paul watson's taking over here with jack the sobak and his great work we're in austin
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:42.560]  paul's in london england and we're looking dead on at the spencer repone um getting out as a sergeant
[3:08:44.480 --> 3:08:49.760]  and he has communism will win in his hat at graduation and a shea guvara shirt under hey i
[3:08:49.760 --> 3:08:53.360]  actually didn't believe it when i read in some right wing publication 20 years ago
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:58.000]  that shea guvara called mexicans roaches so i went to the library and i got his book
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:02.320]  where he called them dumb roaches and a bunch of other stuff and he black people he just absolutely
[3:09:02.320 --> 3:09:07.680]  hated and that's the weird-ass thing about it communists are so evil and so elitist hear
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:11.760]  about the chinese communists calling their peasants scum and stuff uh and saying so what
[3:09:11.760 --> 3:09:15.120]  of you know 50 million died there you know they're a bunch of little little you know
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:19.280]  grasshoppers they call them they mean like eating eating our food potatoes now called them potatoes
[3:09:19.280 --> 3:09:23.760]  yeah all sorts of potatoes don't even just eat them and that's that's the main food over there
[3:09:23.760 --> 3:09:27.200]  and try a lot of parts oh i forgot under the cultural revolution the great way forward the
[3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:33.680]  main food was giant cookpots i forgot that's decline that's public in fact the communists
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:39.280]  have published books admitting it but if there's photos i forgot the guys google giant cookpots
[3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:44.240]  that's communist chinese cooked the villagers in i forgot the 80 something million mainly got eight
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:48.160]  yeah there would there there was cannibalism it was there that was on mao also used the
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:54.240]  cookpots as a form of uh torture oh and when he was up in the mountains in yinan after the long
[3:09:54.240 --> 3:09:58.240]  march he would put you in a pot filled with water overnight when it was freezing cold in the winter
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:01.680]  and just leave you out there and you froze and half your body would be cut off but then they
[3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:04.400]  just cooked you afterwards and then they would just cook you and that's what he would do with his
[3:10:04.400 --> 3:10:08.800]  end by the way you know this is the stuff i've repressed in my brain because there's documentaries
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:14.000]  that the communists have put out saying we we've reformed ourselves we don't put you and cook
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:19.360]  cook you anymore but that's not some right wing propaganda no this is this is stuff that chairman
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:22.560]  mao did this is stuff that it's a completely suppressed in the us really suppressed in china
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:26.720]  but you can go out and actually read the sources that great book there's photos of the cookpots
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:29.760]  yeah there's like putting little kids in them because that was the next time i come and bring
[3:10:29.760 --> 3:10:32.720]  in the book i'm going to bring the book that's got all the photos or we can find it so you can
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:38.080]  find it i've seen it before yeah these what they would do is because and the reason well no they
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:43.360]  actually arrested mao's wife and she died in prison they blamed her for it all right so after
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.880]  right exactly they blamed her for the cultural revolution and there was her and there was three
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:51.200]  others they called them the gang of four and they said no no no is they said mao was just trying to
[3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:56.080]  help the country but it was you for who were giving the orders that and then she died mysteriously in
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:11:00.000]  prison not too long not too long after and that's the thing then you see some snot nose with a free
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:06.800]  education this beautiful wonderful country saying i want to kill people i'm in antifa i want to kill
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:10.720]  capitalist and then they found on the facebook where they're recruiting the military let's put it on
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:14.400]  screen but subject tell us about we're gonna hand the baton to paul watchin so we're looking at this
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:20.080]  guy his uh his twitter account and he's got up there it says dsa veterans and dsa alex that's
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:24.640]  democratic socialists of america so it's a communist that's the original core commie group
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:28.160]  core and so you look at veterans he's got it right there in his bio and i said wait a minute i
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:32.640]  recognize that dsa because that democratic socialists of america that was communist party usa
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:37.120]  and so you look at that and then you go through their feed they've got thousands of followers
[3:11:37.120 --> 3:11:43.040]  they're it's a working group they say that they're targeting specifically it says veterans but as we
[3:11:43.040 --> 3:11:50.960]  know from this guy they're now targeting active duty us military members to convert them to communism
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:56.560]  and let's show the group with a bunch of military people how this is and they're tying it to cavernic
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:01.040]  and the nfl is a recruiting mechanism does they use anything they can because they know these guys
[3:12:01.040 --> 3:12:06.800]  and look he's attacking the army veteran the hispanic army veteran who held his hand over his heart
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:10.880]  saying hey we're going to defeat your ass task and purpose is one of their sites they did a huge
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:14.960]  hit piece on me they called me up and said hey jack we're a veteran site just come talk to us and i
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:19.280]  wrote it up and they wrote all this lander and at the end it just said psobica psobica feuds these
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:23.520]  comments or the or these accusations and i said wait a minute i didn't know they were left-wing
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:27.760]  veterans organizations that's how i first heard about it so task and purpose is actually this sort
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:33.920]  of hugely left-wing hugely communist group that's run by former military members people who got out
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:37.600]  because either they were you know they couldn't keep up the standards or whatever and now they're
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:43.440]  basically designed to attack military members attack people for speaking up for the country
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:48.320]  attack people who are patriotic people like me sure and then they ban any type of conservative
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:53.120]  march at berkeley because antifa will attack you and antifa has their march and attacks our
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:59.440]  reporters and beats up their car and smashes their windows info wars dot com and it's not even big news
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.440]  now we're just accepting that's what happens to us that's how they act that's what they do
[3:13:03.440 --> 3:13:07.840]  as they dream of more violence normalization normalization of violence we talk about how many
[3:13:07.840 --> 3:13:11.600]  months ago did we talk about this the normalization of violence and now we're seeing it now and that's
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:15.520]  my next question for paul's we hand the baton here to paul joseph watchin reporting for london got a
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:23.200]  big guest coming up at the bottom of the yard as well paul we have this is llamas from sudan who
[3:13:23.200 --> 3:13:27.760]  said i want to kill whites i want to kill christians he goes and shoots nine people kills one get
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:32.240]  stopped by an usher with a gun the media demonizes the church what kind of church has got guns well
[3:13:32.240 --> 3:13:37.920]  we're being targeted and then we say this is white genocide from other media we're not the kkk
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:43.200]  people it's the media promoting white genocide they're pushing this it's getting insane and now
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:48.720]  if it's an islamic attack it barely even hits the news and sudik kahn your islamist's mayor who's
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:57.360]  put in the city under sharia law he says that trump is ices for not wanting to kneel like the president
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:01.840]  does the superman desired and just kneel to political correctness so paul let me ask you this
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:06.640]  what are they kneeling to when they're kneeling and why don't they care their ratings and support
[3:14:06.640 --> 3:14:10.960]  is plunging and they're losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year because like poshobik said it's
[3:14:10.960 --> 3:14:18.240]  a program it's a program paul joseph watchin well they're kneeling they're genuflecting
[3:14:18.240 --> 3:14:24.560]  to political correctness and intersectionality and social justice hysteria that's what it's all about
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:31.680]  you know who's kneeling alex for the 300 000 black babies aborted every single year in the united
[3:14:31.680 --> 3:14:39.200]  states who's going to kneel for the 2400 black people killed by not cops other black people
[3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:43.920]  every single year in the united states you know who's going to kneel uh to draw attention to the
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:50.640]  75 percent illegitimacy rate amongst black people in black communities oh by the way calling cappinix
[3:14:50.640 --> 3:14:55.760]  black father left him his his mother is white of course nobody's going to kneel to draw attention
[3:14:55.760 --> 3:15:02.400]  to that oh but trump's racist for bringing it up okay so hillary's back again today herpes hillary
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:07.680]  she's painful embarrassing and won't go away she's back again doing interviews today every single day
[3:15:07.680 --> 3:15:13.440]  forever more she will never go away saying that trump is racist that it's a racist dog whistle
[3:15:13.440 --> 3:15:18.960]  for him to say that nfl players should stand for the national anthem now that's odd because a big
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:25.360]  poll that's come out today has found that the majority of african americans think the same thing
[3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:33.280]  okay 48 percent to 37 percent agree with trump that nfl players should stand for the national anthem
[3:15:33.280 --> 3:15:40.000]  oh but trump's racist was saying the exact same thing you had an msnbc guess earlier today as well
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:46.320]  come out and say that oh trump basically said the n word at this rally in alabama on friday when this
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:52.480]  nfl su first cropped up i mean he didn't and that's an absolutely outrageous claim but yeah he basically
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:16:00.080]  said the n word just by talking about it you have espn you had an espn analyst yesterday say that
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:05.040]  trump because he said that you know it was getting too soft they weren't allowed to bang into each
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:12.160]  other as much in the nfl that was him communicating that he wanted black people to get hurt so again
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:16.800]  it all goes back to this amazing coincidence and that's what i'm going to ask i guess about the
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:23.360]  bottom of the hour cj Pearson a 15 year old activist it all goes back to donald trump
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:29.600]  featuring events by prominent black leaders for years for decades most of them democrats by the
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:36.000]  way giving them money advocating their causes to clean up the inner cities everybody loves him for
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:42.640]  decades oh but as soon as he runs as a republican he's a racist that's what it's come down to but
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:47.920]  the simple fact is americans aren't buying it alex mentioned the poll earlier which is that the vast
[3:16:47.920 --> 3:16:53.920]  majority of americans this is up on info wars dot com the vast majority of americans side with
[3:16:53.920 --> 3:17:00.080]  trump on the take and eat controversy and again as i mentioned before even the majority of democrats
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:06.560]  even democrats in a slim majority of 43 to 41 percent think that nfl players should stand for
[3:17:06.560 --> 3:17:13.840]  the national anthem 64 percent total when they were asked do you think nfl players should stand
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:22.800]  and be respectful during the national anthem 64 percent said yes just 25 percent said no not sure
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:28.240]  11 percent so the vast majority the clear majority we know this is being engineered paul i'm going to
[3:17:28.240 --> 3:17:31.520]  jump out of here but why is it being engineered i'm going to skip both the breaks their network
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:35.120]  breaks we can skip because i know you also probably want to air the amazing video you did
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:39.840]  take a knee is total v s but but we're going to punch out war rooms coming up the subject will
[3:17:39.840 --> 3:17:45.760]  be on that as well three o'clock central rob do's hosting today a lot more coming up but back to you
[3:17:45.760 --> 3:17:52.800]  paul watson in london yeah you have a you have a situation in america where we've seen mass hysteria
[3:17:52.800 --> 3:17:57.280]  from day one we kind of had a break didn't we with the earthquakes the extreme weather events
[3:17:57.280 --> 3:18:03.520]  but still almost a year after the election trump derangement syndrome still runs rampant and that's
[3:18:03.520 --> 3:18:08.560]  what it's all about you'll notice in the first couple of days after this reignited none of them
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:14.000]  really knew what they were taking a knee for oh it's free speech oh it's patriotism oh it's police
[3:18:14.000 --> 3:18:18.960]  brutality haven't even been any major cases of police brutality they're taking a knee to say they
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:26.160]  hate america so they should get the hell out it's it was a continuation of trump derangement syndrome
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:30.880]  they were triggered now trump said a lot of things in that speech the media picked up on that one
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:36.640]  they were triggered by it it's still the fallout from this hysteria about hillary clinton losing
[3:18:36.640 --> 3:18:43.520]  their still not over it over 10 months after the election the three most prominent famous people who
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:49.200]  came out in the hours after trump made this statement about the nfl lebron james furrell
[3:18:49.200 --> 3:18:57.360]  williams the other one was a nba basketball player stef curry all three of them openly campaigned
[3:18:57.360 --> 3:19:02.880]  for hillary clinton before the election before even calling cap and it came out in august of
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:07.680]  2016 which of course was before donald trump was elected they all blamed it on trump for bringing
[3:19:07.680 --> 3:19:12.720]  this back up but again the three most prominent officials who came out in the hours after trump
[3:19:12.720 --> 3:19:18.160]  made these statements had all campaigned for hillary clinton in the case of lebron james
[3:19:19.040 --> 3:19:25.200]  and furrell williams who is a singer they appeared on stage with her furrell williams was playing
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:31.040]  around in her her official campaign jet there's pictures of him walking down the stairs with her
[3:19:31.040 --> 3:19:36.640]  lebron james introduced her on stage hillary clinton they directly campaigned with her and he's
[3:19:36.640 --> 3:19:42.000]  but hurt because he's a loser and so now he's going to call everybody kkk that stands up against
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:49.040]  his spoil rotten ass that's exactly it this is still the fallout they still can't get over it
[3:19:49.040 --> 3:19:55.520]  it is mass it's the moral it's not only a moral panic it's it's it's like the satanic panic of
[3:19:55.520 --> 3:20:01.440]  the 80s it's like the daycare panic again they try and pick up on all these little things to feed into
[3:20:01.440 --> 3:20:08.560]  their paranoia nothing's working so now they've they've rejuvenated this calling cap and it freak
[3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:14.160]  out from a year ago from over a year ago from before when trump was even elected now another
[3:20:14.160 --> 3:20:19.760]  development we've got up on info wars dot com today steeler's owner begs fans not to abandon
[3:20:19.760 --> 3:20:24.160]  team over national anthem protest you remember yesterday we had the big viral story with all
[3:20:24.160 --> 3:20:30.320]  the videos of not only steelers fans but other nfl fans burning their tickets burning their
[3:20:30.320 --> 3:20:36.720]  jerseys burning their nfl gear in protest at this disrespect for the american flag for the anthem
[3:20:36.720 --> 3:20:41.360]  and everything it stands for of course villain who ever came out for the steelers the only player
[3:20:41.360 --> 3:20:47.680]  to come out all the rest of them hid in the locker room he was forced to apologize he was
[3:20:47.680 --> 3:20:52.640]  forced to walk it back oh everybody gets their free speech there was a whole mantra after this
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:57.040]  oh it's just free speech unless you actually want to stand and recognize the anthem then we're
[3:20:57.040 --> 3:21:01.760]  going to attack you in the case of black players who stood for the anthem we're going to call you
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:07.040]  the c word we're going to call you uncle tom villain who ever was forced to walk it back
[3:21:07.040 --> 3:21:13.520]  his own coach of the steelers attacked him immediately after the game ended oh but now
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:20.000]  you're going to try and walk it back too late too late steelers president r rooney the second
[3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:24.480]  pender panicked letter to steelers fans after the team didn't show up to the field during the
[3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:29.360]  national anthem before the game on sunday so again they're reacting to the revolt that's taken
[3:21:29.360 --> 3:21:35.520]  place in the in the 24 hours since rooney was responding to the scores of steelers fans posting
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:40.800]  videos on youtube of them burning their steelers gear and vowing never to support the team ever
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:46.160]  again he rolled the intentions of steelers players were to stay out the businesses of making
[3:21:46.160 --> 3:21:52.640]  political statements by not taking the field bs they deliberately chose to stay in the locker
[3:21:52.640 --> 3:21:58.320]  room to dishonor the anthem that's why villain awayver got in trouble because he's the only one
[3:21:58.320 --> 3:22:04.960]  who didn't so it's bs on top of bs now they're trying to walk it back because everyone's boycotting
[3:22:04.960 --> 3:22:11.040]  them freaking out he goes on to write unfortunately that was interpreted as a boycott of the anthem
[3:22:11.040 --> 3:22:16.640]  oh do you think do you think not actually showing up for the anthem would be interpreted as a boycott
[3:22:16.640 --> 3:22:24.560]  of it oh that was never our in play our players intention he claims bs they they completely
[3:22:24.560 --> 3:22:29.120]  crucified villain awayver for doing the opposite because they all agreed to boycott it before the
[3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:35.360]  game that's what it was all about so now they're trying to walk it back donald trump has been
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:41.920]  proven right once again when he said that the nfl at least has the right to fire these players
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:48.000]  for their quote free speech isn't it amazing how oh when google when youtube censors us the left
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:53.280]  screams oh but google's a private company they can censor who they like they can censor your free
[3:22:53.280 --> 3:23:00.320]  speech if they like it's a private company well the nfl is a private company okay it can do the
[3:23:00.320 --> 3:23:06.240]  same thing oh no that's horrible and trumps literally hitler for saying it complete disconnect
[3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:12.320]  fox news reports trump is correct nfl teams can legally fire players for their conduct the first
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:17.520]  amendment does not protect national football league players from being fired the constitution's freedom
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:24.960]  of expression applies only to government action not private businesses somebody can't run into
[3:23:24.960 --> 3:23:31.280]  your house and call you a call you every name under the sun and then claim it's their freedom of
[3:23:31.280 --> 3:23:38.160]  speech no that's not freedom of speech doesn't apply for private businesses oh but you know
[3:23:38.720 --> 3:23:43.200]  they'll come down they'll come crashing down hard on the bakery that won't bake a gay wedding cake
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:49.360]  but the nfl can do whatever it likes oh the nfl supports free speech unless you want to honor
[3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:56.080]  dead cops killed by a black lives matter activist or unless you want to honor 9 11 victims then no
[3:23:56.080 --> 3:24:02.800]  they'll come crashing down hard on your free speech in that case oh but if you want to genuflect to
[3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:08.800]  this social justice warrior intersectional insanity they'll give you all the support you need
[3:24:08.800 --> 3:24:17.200]  interesting also coming out of this poll I mentioned before clearly shows clearly illustrates that
[3:24:17.200 --> 3:24:24.400]  people and even democrats are absolutely sick of politics being inserted into absolutely everything
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:29.120]  so we had 64 percent of respondents basically supporting trump saying that players should
[3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:34.800]  stand for the anthem even democrats in a slim majority support that as did african americans
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:40.960]  almost double 60 to 31 percent said there was a more appropriate place to demonstrate and
[3:24:40.960 --> 3:24:46.400]  during the anthem at the beginning of nfl games and again they were asked quote in the future
[3:24:46.400 --> 3:24:51.120]  would you prefer to see more politics less politics or the same amount of politics during
[3:24:51.120 --> 3:24:59.600]  sporting events 80 percent 80 percent wanted less politics with just seven percent wanting
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:08.000]  more politics and again the huge majority of even democrats wanted less politics 51 to 19 percent
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:15.440]  of americans said they were watching less nfl football this year when asked why 69 again the
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:21.840]  clear majority way above any other reason said it was due to quote players using the nfl as a stage
[3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:29.040]  for their political views this is a dog that doesn't hunt trump has chosen the right side here
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:33.520]  but they're doubling down they're going to collapse into this narrative which is a completely failed
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:41.920]  narrative even joe scarborough of msnbc no fan of trump constantly attacks trump admitted in a
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:47.920]  tweet on sunday night i think it was that this is just a losing game for democrats on the left if
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:54.640]  they really want to take on trump given that he's now associated opposition to him with opposition
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:26:00.640]  to america itself it's a losing narrative for them now again they asked people in this poll
[3:26:01.200 --> 3:26:07.120]  who who was who had who did they have the most favorable view of donald trump or nfl permissioner
[3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:14.640]  roger goodall donald trump 46 favorability which is roughly in line with his president
[3:26:14.640 --> 3:26:24.800]  presidential approval rating roger goodall 12 percent 12 percent that is absolutely pathetic
[3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:30.480]  that's what people in this poll said again the american people are sick of being bombarded with
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:38.960]  social justice and identity politics in absolutely everything every single awards show even drama
[3:26:38.960 --> 3:26:45.280]  shows even movies netflix bombarded with this crap on a regular basis people are turning off
[3:26:45.280 --> 3:26:53.040]  in droves hollywood is failing the golden globes losing its audience the vma and tv music awards
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:58.480]  losing its audience what did it lose like half of its audience in a couple of years people don't
[3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:04.240]  want to hear this anymore they're sick to the back teeth of it the situation you have going on in
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:11.360]  hollywood where they also try to inject all this identity politics virtue signaling cultural jihad
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:16.960]  into absolutely everything is that you know they used to be rescued if they made a bad film in
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:23.280]  hollywood by dvd sales that's not happening anymore because now of course we have netflix
[3:27:23.280 --> 3:27:30.160]  that safety net has gone which is why in hollywood they take fewer and fewer risks with movie scripts
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:37.600]  which is why you see this constant regurgitation of superhero sequels star wars batman superman
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:42.480]  because they know it's reliable and they know people are going to watch it really whatever the plot
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:47.600]  so that's why they can inject this identity politics social justice hysteria and of course who
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:53.680]  suffers the viewing audience because we never get any kind of nuance we never get any kind of variety
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:28:01.520]  in big movies now you get the occasional one in fact kingsman two just came out and even though
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:09.120]  it's not overtly political the mere fact the mere fact that they don't inject diversity hires and
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:15.200]  social justice identity politics into every facet of the script now they're getting attacked by the
[3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:22.240]  left for not doing that because like the three lead guys in the film are all white men doesn't
[3:28:22.240 --> 3:28:28.080]  even matter nobody even cared about this 20 years ago nobody cared you could have a massive block
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:33.360]  buster film you could have something like independence day two lead roles a black guy
[3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:39.440]  and a jewish guy nobody cared nobody noticed because it worked now with all these enforced
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:44.960]  diversity hires where it has to be oh you have to have to have a black man and a jewish woman and
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:51.920]  transgender person disabled person whatever is getting worse and worse it's at the script the
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:57.360]  movie suffers because they're all hyper focused on that not focused on just making a good movie and
[3:28:57.360 --> 3:29:03.600]  then it's filled it's stuffed to the brim with all this virtue signaling and identity politics crap
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:08.240]  it gets in the way of a good movie that's why hollywood is beginning to fail that's why all
[3:29:08.240 --> 3:29:12.800]  these big award shows are beginning to fail because they're obsessed with their trump
[3:29:12.800 --> 3:29:18.880]  derangement syndrome it's absolutely insane let me know if we're skipping this break by the way
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:24.480]  we've got a guest coming up yeah we're gonna go for this break but after the break we have cj
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:31.040]  pierce and who is gonna talk about this nfl take a knee controversy from the perspective of an african

[3:29:50.480 --> 3:29:56.080]  confusion and distress in america arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation not
[3:29:56.080 --> 3:30:01.840]  from want of honor or virtue so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit
[3:30:01.840 --> 3:30:07.120]  and circulation those are the words of john adams the second president of the united states
[3:30:07.120 --> 3:30:12.400]  are you ignorant of the private federal reserve do you understand the nature of our fiat currency
[3:30:12.400 --> 3:30:17.760]  do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[3:30:17.760 --> 3:30:22.400]  and to profit from it what kind of leverage do these people in the federal reserve have
[3:30:22.400 --> 3:30:26.800]  over the american people or for that matter what kind of leverage do the southies have
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:32.960]  over our money will you be a slave or will you be free adams also said liberty cannot be preserved

[3:31:53.920 --> 3:31:59.600]  years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully
[3:31:59.600 --> 3:32:05.040]  aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[3:32:05.040 --> 3:32:10.800]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[3:32:10.800 --> 3:32:16.960]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated
[3:32:16.960 --> 3:32:24.480]  bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging

[3:32:57.600 --> 3:33:08.400]  host paul joseph watson we are back live it is the alex joneshow we're gonna hit a couple of news
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:15.280]  stories here alex mentioned earlier this shooter in tennessee who went into a church injured seven
[3:33:15.280 --> 3:33:20.480]  killed one woman of course the media is completely forgotten about it looks like it was a terror attack
[3:33:21.040 --> 3:33:28.800]  perhaps alt left motivated daily caller reports msnbc leaves out tennessee shooters nationality
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:34.560]  msnbc has refused to sell its viewers that the gunman in the tennessee church shooting
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:40.080]  is a sfeudonese immigrant instead identifying him as being from tennessee oh it's just a local
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:46.960]  just a local workplace violence no doubt in the seven mentions of the shooter's identity on the
[3:33:46.960 --> 3:33:52.640]  network from sunday afternoon when the shooting occurred until monday morning msnbc never mentioned
[3:33:52.640 --> 3:33:58.000]  his status as an immigrant they did share his name age photo in his residence in tennessee
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:06.320]  now of course we had the story yesterday that this individual had shared commented on sympathized
[3:34:06.320 --> 3:34:13.520]  with videos on facebook which basically smeared all white people as terrorists isn't that interesting
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:20.400]  given what happened last year of course in dalis with havie a johnson the black the pro black lives
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:26.080]  matter gunman who massacred dalis copped of course doing it in his own words to get back against
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:31.840]  white people because he hated white people so now we have a situation in tennessee where this
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:38.320]  guy burst into the church luckily was stopped after a grapple with the thing was a 22 year old
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:44.560]  guy in the church who was pistol whipped but still managed to stop him managed to cause the shooter
[3:34:44.560 --> 3:34:49.600]  to actually shoot himself that's how he was actually apprehended then he went and got his
[3:34:49.600 --> 3:34:55.920]  license gone the situation was over but seven wounded it could have been potentially way more
[3:34:55.920 --> 3:35:01.920]  catastrophic one woman dead this has been completely buried nobody nobody was people
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:07.520]  were barely even talking about it yesterday the day after it happened now it's been completely
[3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:12.800]  buried how is this not of equal importance so something like what happened in charlottesville
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:19.200]  which also you know injured several people killed one tragic deplorable this is the same
[3:35:19.200 --> 3:35:24.560]  but nobody's even talking about this anymore it's gone because again it's it's not too great for
[3:35:24.560 --> 3:35:31.120]  their narrative given that sedan was again one of the original companies on the trump ban list
[3:35:31.840 --> 3:35:36.320]  that's being removed in the most recent incarnation of that ban list but again
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:42.960]  completely buried by the media ms mbc won't even talk about his nationality absolutely incredible
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:50.800]  mention this one earlier ms mbc analysts this is daily caller again trump basically shouted
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:57.280]  the n-word ms mbc analyst and glp strategist steve schmitt said tuesday morning that president
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:36:05.120]  trump basically said the n-word by deriding nfl players as sons of bitches now again we go back
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:11.760]  75 illegitimacy rate in the black community nobody's going to take a knee over that no
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:17.040]  they're going to get offended over trump saying the words sons of bitches that's what we need to
[3:36:17.040 --> 3:36:23.680]  get offended about okay schmitt said during a panel on ms mbc live that you watched an nfl player
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:30.320]  get jammed up when someone asked him if trump is a racist again amazing that trump only became a
[3:36:30.320 --> 3:36:36.000]  racist when he ran as a republican having previously appeared with black leaders for years and even
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:42.320]  decades down the line appeared at spoke at black events donated money for inocity projects to help
[3:36:42.320 --> 3:36:47.840]  the black community but as soon as he runs as a republican he's a racist as are all his supporters
[3:36:47.840 --> 3:36:55.520]  according to hillary clinton so schmitt said let me say it he's a racist absolutely incredibly
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:37:01.360]  novel original insult there well done schmitt argued that trumps battle with the kneeling nfl
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:06.480]  protesters during his rally in alabama proves that he is a racist and in fact is basically shouting
[3:37:06.480 --> 3:37:12.480]  the n-word that's what he's basically shouting the n-word because he made a point which you
[3:37:12.480 --> 3:37:19.520]  disagree with so he did as good as said the n-word okay you're insane you're hysterical quote you
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:25.920]  look at that speech in alabama to an all-white crowd again wasn't all white there are actually
[3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:30.240]  black people in alabama there are actually black trump supporters i know you don't recognize them
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:35.360]  as actual people who have their own volition and ability to think because you have the bigotry of
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:39.360]  local expectations and you're the actual racist but no there were black people in that crowd
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:44.320]  quote we need to get real about this in this country the president of the united states
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:49.760]  goes down there and he talks about us and those people he came as proverbially as close as you
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:55.920]  can possibly come to shouting a rally at a rally the n-word that's what he did down there
[3:37:55.920 --> 3:38:02.240]  there actually didn't come anywhere close to it didn't even make anything racial out of it but
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:08.160]  you're so hopped up on the brigging race card every single day with your anti-trump hysteria
[3:38:08.160 --> 3:38:15.200]  that even when he doesn't even approach racial rhetoric you say he basically said the n-word
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:25.280]  no you're insane shut up this is another one huffington post this is even more stupid donald
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:32.960]  trump prefers violent football so more black players get hurt says espn analyst because espn
[3:38:32.960 --> 3:38:38.400]  which is now the social justice network has basically ceased being the sports network when
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:43.280]  president donald trump spoke in alabama on friday against nfl players who kneel during the national
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:48.480]  anthem he also appeared to come out in favor of concussions during his speech trump argued that
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:54.800]  rules designed to minimize concussion concussions and cte a neuro degenerative disease are ruining
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:39:01.680]  the game so you probably remember the quote trump said today if you hit too hard 15 yards throw him
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:05.600]  out of the game they had that last week i watched for a couple of minutes two guys just really
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:10.480]  beautiful tackle boom 15 yards the referee gets on television his wife is sitting at home
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:17.040]  she's so proud of him they're ruining the game so trump thinks that they're ruining ruining the
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:21.280]  game that it's becoming too pansy that people aren't allowed to tackle each other properly
[3:39:21.280 --> 3:39:32.000]  no that's racist what what espn analyst kevin blackstone was interviewed by msm bc's nicole wallis
[3:39:32.800 --> 3:39:38.000]  what a combination that is to argue a shocking point the reason the president prefers violent
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:43.600]  football games is because it ensures more black men get hurt yes that's obviously the reasonable
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:49.840]  logical conclusion that anyone would jump to if somebody said that obviously he's talking about
[3:39:49.840 --> 3:39:54.320]  that it's not as physical as it once was and that it's ruining the game because it's not as
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:39:59.920]  competitive and hard hitting anyone with half a brain cell could gauge that from what he said
[3:39:59.920 --> 3:40:06.400]  but no we have to turn it into something racist because that's the essence of intersectionality
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:14.480]  every little frigging thing is a racial microaggression so this idiot ns espn analyst said
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:19.280]  quote you look at stacking by position and those positions that suffer the greatest from cte they're
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:25.520]  the positions that black males are more likely to play well what 70 percent of the nfl is black
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:31.360]  anyway like that's an argument blackstone said the fact that trump dismissed details like that as
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:38.160]  well as suggesting cte or chronic traumatic encolopathy renunciation does not exist shows a
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:43.200]  callousness towards the athletes adding and particularly the black athletes who play this game
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:48.560]  trump did not have to say explicitly anything about black players but it came across loud and clear
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:54.960]  so it's the exact same as the previous instance with him saying the n word so oh he didn't actually
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:40:59.680]  say the n word but he might have well has said the n word because we're hysterical and we think
[3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:04.480]  literally everything that rolls out of his mouth is racist so we're just going to say he basically
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:08.800]  said the n word we're just going to say he basically said he wants black people to die
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:16.160]  he wants black people to get concussions oh my god the trump derangement syndrome truly
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:24.960]  knows no bounds we have our guest now ready he is cj pearson 15 years old political activist writer
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:32.720]  and commentator national chairman of teens for trump the website is cjpearson.org cj good to
[3:41:32.720 --> 3:41:39.280]  have you on the show today hey paul it's a pleasure to be here now of course we had hillary clinton
[3:41:39.280 --> 3:41:45.280]  cj come out earlier and basically say that trump was blowing on this racist dog whistle
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:51.920]  by attacking the nfl and that he's basically attacking black people we had the msnbc guest
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:57.360]  i mentioned earlier say that he was basically coming out and saying the n word at his alabama
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:42:03.440]  rally even though he didn't say the n word went nowhere near anything racial now we have a poll
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:11.520]  the majority of african americans 48 to 37 percent agree with trump that nfl players should stand for
[3:42:11.520 --> 3:42:18.160]  the anthem so i mean cj is donald trump attacking players who take any because he hates black people
[3:42:18.160 --> 3:42:24.800]  or because he hates seeing america being disrespected i think it's really the latter he hates being
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:31.200]  america being disrespected i think few um people like you know secretary of uh secretary of
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:35.440]  housing and urban development then carcum would argue that donald trump hates black people i doubt
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:40.000]  the black search in general that donald trump appointed would argue that donald trump hates
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:43.840]  black people you know the louis and see that we are hearing from people like hilly clinton and that
[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:50.640]  guest decided on what msnbc is absolutely just a madman in a way like you said um in your intro
[3:42:50.640 --> 3:42:55.520]  uh trump derangement syndrome is seemingly it knows their bounds and it's completely
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:00.320]  and it's changed me because everything that comes out of this mouth for this part that has to be
[3:43:00.320 --> 3:43:05.520]  raised that has to be bigoted it has to be some sign or indicator of life supremacy and completely
[3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:10.960]  ludicrous this is a man who's defending our country our nation and sacrifice because so many people
[3:43:10.960 --> 3:43:15.760]  who have died fighting for this country and a majority of americans agree with them and that's
[3:43:15.760 --> 3:43:21.440]  the thing a majority of americans agree with them and to and for hilly clinton to claim that somehow
[3:43:21.440 --> 3:43:26.320]  some way that by attacking s l that the donald trump is attacking black people i'd ask her i'd
[3:43:26.320 --> 3:43:30.880]  actually ask her to look at the nfl and its demographic makeup there's only one minority
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:36.400]  owner in the nfl and everyone else well they're not motivated by their you know passion for the
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:40.800]  cause that carlson is viewing or anyways they're motivated by the ratings they're motivated by the
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:47.280]  money they have to be willing to cash in on disrespect of this country is absolutely disgusting
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:55.920]  now because we had sheila jackson lee congresswoman today taken me they seem to figure out amongst
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:43:59.760]  themselves i mean in the first day or so they didn't really know why they were doing it again
[3:43:59.760 --> 3:44:06.240]  because they haven't been any high profile cases of police brutality but i mean you know 16 unarmed
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:15.040]  black men shot dead by cops every year yes that's 16 too many but cj 2400 on average black men shot
[3:44:15.040 --> 3:44:22.720]  by other black men every single year in the united states what should we be taking a knee for
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:27.840]  given those circumstances which do you think is the most pressing issue for the black community
[3:44:27.840 --> 3:44:32.240]  you're right and those issues are incredibly important those are all issues that our president
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:37.360]  is accused of white supremacy and racism every single day because of the shine of light on every
[3:44:37.360 --> 3:44:41.440]  single day he thinks the shine of light on that excuse he thinks the shine of light on the issue
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:46.400]  that 59% of black youth are unemployed in this country and this is the problem that's plagued
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:50.800]  america since the start of the obama administration this is a president who's accused of racism
[3:44:50.800 --> 3:44:55.760]  every single day for caring about the plight of black america in this country if they want to take
[3:44:55.760 --> 3:45:00.080]  a knee maybe they should take a knee for the black babies who are dying every single day in
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:05.040]  chicago maybe they should take a knee for the children who can't find a job in the inner cities
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:09.360]  of america because they're the communities are ran by incompetent democratic politicians
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:13.360]  who realized we elected time and time again regardless of the incompetence they show
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:18.560]  towards the plight of black america this is a president who's shown to burn for black america
[3:45:18.560 --> 3:45:24.080]  this is a president who cares about black america and to accuse him of racism and bigotry just
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:30.880]  to sit and earn it is absolutely disgusting you mentioned it there you know 300 000 black
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:35.280]  babies are bought at every year in the united states so those those lives don't seem to matter
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:40.320]  those black lives don't seem to matter to people if they're in the womb and you can kill them and
[3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:45.680]  you're a progressive that's not even part of the debate again in chicago we literally got
[3:45:45.680 --> 3:45:51.680]  relentless carnage what you've got 700 dead black people every single year in chicago the
[3:45:51.680 --> 3:45:57.760]  weekends are an absolute train wreck every single weekend nobody's talking about it everybody's
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:03.200]  talking about this police brutality issue which has flared up with these individual cases some
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:08.480]  of them are egregious like you know eric garner others not i would argue michael brown it's a
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:14.000]  case of criminals are getting into violent confrontations with cops and and and seeing
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:18.880]  the consequence of that but i want to talk about some of the some of the things that you've been
[3:46:18.880 --> 3:46:25.360]  subjected to because again this is what i know is they save their most racist vitriol the left
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:30.480]  for smart black conservatives you see it every time you tweeted this the other day i've been
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:35.440]  called the n-word by liberals far more than i have ever been called the n-word by any republican
[3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:41.920]  who are the real racists you had black nfl players a couple of days ago who stood up for the anthan
[3:46:41.920 --> 3:46:47.200]  you could go on twitter they were like labeled the c word they were labeled uncle tom's the worst
[3:46:47.200 --> 3:46:52.480]  thing you could imagine for their free speech okay they made a decision to do that for their free
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:57.600]  speech cj do you think the left has any kind of moral high ground when it comes to dishing out
[3:46:57.600 --> 3:47:04.000]  the racist label given that this is how they treat african african americans who dare to have a
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:09.040]  different opinion yeah they have no more hard ground now and they nor should they have other to
[3:47:09.040 --> 3:47:12.880]  be offered to you it's in the history of this party it's the part that was founded upon the
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:19.360]  pillar of racism we really found it to preserve slavery the the idea that black people were
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:25.600]  property this is the party founded to fight for that that is there's a historical link that you
[3:47:25.600 --> 3:47:29.360]  you can't run away from that you can't run away from that and now you come to the president this
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:34.480]  is a party that is so called you know so called the party of tolerance right but when a black boy
[3:47:34.480 --> 3:47:38.560]  says something that a black boy is supposed to say i'm labeled an uncle tom i'm labeled a house
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:43.840]  and grow i'm labeled this and that well the fact of the matter is that like i said in my tweet i've
[3:47:43.840 --> 3:47:48.160]  never been really called that by any republican but every single day i say something that the
[3:47:48.160 --> 3:47:53.920]  left doesn't like i'm called that by every democrat across the country it's it's it's disgusting it's
[3:47:53.920 --> 3:48:00.080]  disgusting it's demeaning and and and and really it really it's it's i like it's i like because
[3:48:00.080 --> 3:48:04.320]  this is the party right it's a lot of human depression but when we say things they don't like
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:08.320]  you know they need their space space so they're angry with us and they call it these things and
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:14.080]  they need to shut us down um but also this is a party that is the party that supports people of
[3:48:14.080 --> 3:48:18.800]  color right but they don't support people of color who don't support them and i think it just goes
[3:48:18.800 --> 3:48:23.920]  to show the limited tolerance that democrats have for people who don't agree with their ideology
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:30.160]  no i had red pill black on who is you probably heard of her she's she's getting big now she's
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:35.040]  on fox news the other day she said the same thing she said obviously she's an african-american woman
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:40.480]  she used to get bullied at school for quote acting white she said now i had this nba coach
[3:48:40.480 --> 3:48:45.440]  who came out yesterday and said that white people should be made to feel uncomfortable over this
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:50.480]  take anything we were talking about white privilege we're talking about black people getting bullied
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:57.520]  for acting white she said acting white equated to working hard and being smart i mean we all
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:02.720]  start at different baselines but last time i checked you didn't have to be white to work hard and to
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:08.000]  educate yourself you know how much of this discussion over white privilege cj is because
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:14.560]  some in the black community try to drag others back so as not to expose their own laziness
[3:49:14.560 --> 3:49:19.600]  their own lack of get up and go in life a lot of black people who are successful seem to experience
[3:49:19.600 --> 3:49:28.560]  that that's right that's the reason you'll never catch me the reason that i will always respect
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:32.720]  the red one and blue is it is this is a country in which if you work hard and play by the rule that you
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:37.680]  can be anything you set out to be if you work hard you do what you're supposed to do you can be anything
[3:49:37.680 --> 3:49:44.400]  which is america a land of limitless opportunity if you put your nose to grindstone you can succeed
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:48.800]  text me a little about this country it doesn't matter what's on why black's on mexican it doesn't
[3:49:48.800 --> 3:49:53.440]  matter all i need to do is work hard and i can achieve you know we see this in every community
[3:49:53.440 --> 3:49:59.440]  people who are lazy people aren't doing anything and they blame their situation on everything else
[3:49:59.440 --> 3:50:03.280]  but themselves eventually you know if you've learned everyone else about yourself maybe you
[3:50:03.280 --> 3:50:08.880]  just realize that you're the problem and not everyone else and the idea here is that this is
[3:50:08.880 --> 3:50:13.680]  america and i am proud to be an american because this is a country that has given much to me and
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:19.280]  i hope one day i can give as much as it's given to me to this country back to this country um
[3:50:19.280 --> 3:50:22.800]  because like i said this is a land of limitless opportunity if you work hard and play by the
[3:50:22.800 --> 3:50:30.800]  rules you can succeed and i think in any other country is that for success as it is here in america
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:36.720]  now i just want to ask you about this quickly cj because of course black lives matter ties into
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:41.280]  all that we're seeing now with the nfl i vaguely remember you had some conversations with black
[3:50:41.280 --> 3:50:48.480]  lives matter leaders a while back what impression did those conversations leave you of blm as a group
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:54.640]  and do you think that primary goal is to improve racial harmony or do they have a different agenda
[3:50:55.360 --> 3:50:58.560]  yeah definitely so i've had the opportunity to you know kind of have a dialogue with some
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:02.960]  of the leaders of black lives matter and you know i gotta say there's some pretty interesting people
[3:51:02.960 --> 3:51:07.760]  they care about the issue of police brutality at the end of the day a lot of them have really
[3:51:07.760 --> 3:51:11.920]  has kind of talked up to this thing like and that this is a suitable form of protest to protest
[3:51:11.920 --> 3:51:15.840]  the message that's awesome about you know you probably know it's visible when people talk about
[3:51:15.840 --> 3:51:22.080]  colon trafficking to protest no one is talking about why he's doing it or the reason you know he
[3:51:22.080 --> 3:51:26.720]  claims to be doing it for no one talks about that people talk about the fact that he is disrespecting
[3:51:26.720 --> 3:51:32.080]  america by doing what he is doing um and so what i would have to say is black lives matter really
[3:51:32.080 --> 3:51:37.440]  wants to achieve that racial harmony that they claim to want and claim to want to see here in
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:42.960]  this country and they have to pull up the table and they need to talk about their issues kneeling
[3:51:42.960 --> 3:51:46.880]  on the football field a part of millions of americans is not going to do anything but divide
[3:51:46.880 --> 3:51:52.160]  us further a majority of americans believe that what NFL players are doing is wrong misguided
[3:51:52.160 --> 3:51:57.200]  and downright disrespectful to the sacrifices of people who have died fighting for their country
[3:51:57.200 --> 3:52:01.840]  that is not a way to achieve unity there's not a way to bring us together if they want to bring
[3:52:01.840 --> 3:52:06.240]  us together have a seat at the table there are multiple ways to voice your opinions in america
[3:52:06.240 --> 3:52:11.040]  this is america you know there is freedom of speech even if the left wants to shut it down
[3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:17.120]  sometimes it's still exist in this country and they want to achieve something talk about the issue
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:24.320]  we don't disrespect our country want to do it and the poll show as i mentioned before 80 plus are
[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:29.280]  just sick of having politics injected into everything like people watch nfl to get away
[3:52:29.280 --> 3:52:34.240]  from the constant drumbeat of social justice and identity politics and more and more people are
