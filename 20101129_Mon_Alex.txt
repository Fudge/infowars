[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:34.880]  Texas Alex Jones we're live my friends it is the 29th day of November 2010 we're
[00:34.880 --> 00:41.360]  gonna be live here for the next three hours I say this almost now at least
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.880]  once a week at the start of a broadcast we have never had this much crazy news
[00:45.880 --> 00:51.680]  going on and I talk about it a lot years ago once or twice a year I might
[00:51.680 --> 00:58.800]  say it's never been this crazy now it's every week and it's it's getting
[00:58.800 --> 01:06.640]  exponential the quickening that we're all witnessing here it's insane we've
[01:06.640 --> 01:15.160]  got the WikiLeaks situation that is being called a global diplomatic meltdown by
[01:15.160 --> 01:21.400]  the New York Times the London Guardian we have North Korea threatening to start
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.960]  an all-out war we've got China and Russia openly announcing last Wednesday
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.720]  they're gonna completely dump the dollar we have all of this draconian
[01:31.720 --> 01:36.960]  legislation being rammed through in the United States to shut down farms and
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.760]  ranches and shut down any websites the government wants with no judge no jury
[01:41.760 --> 01:48.680]  no nothing just unnamed bureaucrats with total Stalinist power we've got giant
[01:48.680 --> 01:54.360]  banker bailouts being announced worldwide not just in the US we've got
[01:54.360 --> 01:58.320]  the White House announcing that they're gonna freeze pay for federal workers for
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.600]  two years which sounds popular but I want to go deeper because remember Gates
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.680]  is also the Secretary of Defense seeking to contain military health cost
[02:07.680 --> 02:12.120]  cutting health care for troops here's another one remember going back to last
[02:12.120 --> 02:17.600]  year military update Obama drops veterans insurance proposal more showdowns loom
[02:17.600 --> 02:22.560]  that's out of the stars and stripes remember wanting to make the troops by
[02:22.560 --> 02:28.240]  their own insurance the bankers need to have a tax put on them they need to be
[02:28.240 --> 02:31.760]  indicted the big mega six banks they need to pay back the trillions they've
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.320]  stolen and they won't tell Congress where it went I'm all for government cuts
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.120]  but you don't cut veterans health care and and things like that and lay off
[02:42.120 --> 02:48.920]  local police and then leave the bankers alone this is this is insane and all
[02:48.920 --> 02:52.760]  these big line Republicans like the governor of New Jersey and places that
[02:52.760 --> 02:57.320]  are being worshipped as these great trailblazers if you really analyze what
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.680]  they're saying it's never abolished the Federal Reserve it's never arrest the
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.360]  banking cartel it's never in the fractional reserve banking it's never
[03:04.360 --> 03:09.280]  you'll follow Ron Paul's constitutional plan it's always just slash
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.280]  everything but raise the taxes to pay our entire GDP to the bankers like we're
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.720]  Nigeria or Argentina or Brazil and the good news is in places like Brazil they
[03:19.720 --> 03:24.680]  kicked the bankers out so their economy supercharged if the Brazilians can kick
[03:24.680 --> 03:28.720]  them out like they did 10 years ago we can kick these people out and say we're
[03:28.720 --> 03:33.240]  not paying this debt off it's a fraud eat it bankers now they want a world
[03:33.240 --> 03:36.360]  government to enforce this I mean I mean it's off the charts we have TSA
[03:36.360 --> 03:41.480]  information off the charts total collapse by the TSA I've got incredible
[03:41.480 --> 03:47.160]  information two weeks ago I barely mentioned it last week I went crazy
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.840]  when a caller called in and said have you read the official UN plan for forced
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.760]  relocation worldwide of populations and I said yes I did read that and I got mad
[03:56.760 --> 04:01.200]  at myself why hadn't I covered it well I sent it to Watson and Steve Watson and
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.840]  Aaron Dykes and the crew a week ago not blaming them they're busy too I mean it's
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.160]  like it's like we're a batter with a hundred baseballs coming at us there's a
[04:09.160 --> 04:13.040]  hundred Nolan Ryan's out there throwing speedballs at a hundred miles an hour
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.600]  at us and we're just I mean I don't even know what to say anymore it's just
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.360]  complete all out globalist assault on every front they are coming over the
[04:21.360 --> 04:26.360]  walls of the Alamo and I'm just up here swinging my musket I'm out of bullets
[04:26.360 --> 04:31.640]  and the most of the public's on the fence now the public is starting to wake up
[04:31.640 --> 04:34.440]  but they're still sitting there on the fence rubbing the sleep out of their
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.240]  eyes look stick your head in the ice water drink a gallon of black coffee and
[04:38.240 --> 04:44.840]  get in on the field man we're being overrun here the globalist are in full
[04:44.840 --> 04:49.760]  scale assault mode right now and yeah they're smoking it on fire but they're
[04:49.760 --> 04:53.440]  still running over the top of us because they've got the initiative we're
[04:53.440 --> 04:57.040]  starting to get the initiative it's time to get in the game and kick their butt
[04:57.040 --> 05:02.600]  we'll be right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.600 --> 05:06.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[05:06.920 --> 05:10.280]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[05:10.280 --> 05:14.200]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[05:14.200 --> 05:18.400]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[05:18.400 --> 05:22.840]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[05:22.840 --> 05:27.600]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.600 --> 05:31.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.400 --> 05:35.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.360 --> 05:42.520]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.520 --> 05:46.200]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.960]  can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar
[05:50.960 --> 05:55.240]  backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[05:55.240 --> 06:03.200]  backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have fallen to
[06:03.200 --> 06:08.440]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[06:08.440 --> 06:12.560]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[06:12.560 --> 06:16.840]  Americans at home have tremendous influence on our president in
[06:16.840 --> 06:21.680]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all
[06:21.680 --> 06:26.640]  of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies
[06:26.640 --> 06:31.240]  the enemies of our nation the criminal off-shore cartel hell bent on
[06:31.240 --> 06:35.320]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim
[06:35.320 --> 06:39.280]  Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.960]  Congress is saying who to make the check out to today seems like nobody does
[06:42.960 --> 06:48.960]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get
[06:48.960 --> 06:54.280]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching
[06:54.280 --> 07:02.560]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot TV hi folks this is
[07:02.560 --> 07:06.320]  Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can
[07:06.320 --> 07:10.440]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[07:10.440 --> 07:14.760]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the
[07:14.760 --> 07:18.120]  respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[07:18.120 --> 07:22.840]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[07:22.840 --> 07:27.880]  yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[07:27.880 --> 07:32.240]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[07:32.240 --> 07:36.480]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[07:36.480 --> 07:41.320]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[07:41.320 --> 07:45.840]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[07:45.840 --> 07:51.040]  to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[07:51.040 --> 07:57.960]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[07:57.960 --> 08:08.960]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:13.680 --> 08:17.480]  we've got Lord Christopher Moncton joining us coming up in an hour and a
[08:17.480 --> 08:23.480]  half covering the United Nations summit that is kicking off just a few days
[08:23.480 --> 08:30.320]  down in Mexico I happen to have the London Telegraph here in front of me
[08:30.320 --> 08:35.960]  Cancun climate change summit scientists call for rationing in developed world
[08:35.960 --> 08:41.120]  and off and on the last few weeks I have read from the special climate change
[08:41.120 --> 08:48.800]  program 2009-2012 in Mexico and some people got confused when I briefly
[08:48.800 --> 08:53.040]  covered this last week they thought I was talking about just Mexico worldwide
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.160]  this is a global meeting about the whole world okay and they're saying
[08:58.160 --> 09:03.840]  everywhere in the world they want to force you off your land and into zones
[09:03.840 --> 09:09.520]  where you're allowed to live including forced relocation now I'm gonna get one
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.720]  of my writers who again who are all pinned down having a huge effect
[09:13.720 --> 09:19.360]  rewriting as many stories as they can on the deluge of critical intel coming in
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.040]  the globalists have unclogged themselves they're at point blank range
[09:23.040 --> 09:30.280]  blasting us and that's causing a lot of people to start to wake up but not fast
[09:30.280 --> 09:37.000]  enough the good news is the sleeping giant is starting to awaken and this is
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.080]  the Telegraph reading the same report I mean it's a lengthy report it's just
[09:46.080 --> 09:52.720]  the boil down as 11 pages it links into over 500 pages where the real meat and
[09:52.720 --> 09:56.280]  potatoes are and I've tried to read this I'll be honest with you I've probably
[09:56.280 --> 10:00.520]  only read a hundred pages of the full 400 500 page report and I've read the
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.040]  entire 11 page synopsis and it's just all filled with total feudalism pure
[10:06.040 --> 10:13.120]  evil I mean you've got stuff in here on page six the second stage strengthening
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.400]  strategic large-scale adaptation capacities that means putting the
[10:17.400 --> 10:23.120]  control grid in forcing you to shift from 2013 to 2030 includes the priorities
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.200]  attaining equilibrium between degradation deforestation they always
[10:28.200 --> 10:32.440]  claim they're trying to help you and restoration reforestation the US has
[10:32.440 --> 10:35.120]  more trees in it than it had a hundred years ago that's a fact the forest
[10:35.120 --> 10:40.200]  service admits that the adaptation implementation a sustainable agriculture
[10:40.200 --> 10:44.520]  you've seen the new bills in Congress where no dust is allowed to be released
[10:44.520 --> 10:49.120]  by a tractor are there huge fines it's impossible but then the big agribusiness
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.160]  they get waivers they're writing this the eradication of measures that
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.880]  encourage environmental degradation that just means total tyranny they can
[10:57.880 --> 11:02.200]  claim anything they want to degradation and cause GHG emissions greenhouse gas
[11:02.200 --> 11:07.320]  just shut down eradicate any greenhouse gas will you exhale it as Bill Gates said
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.400]  he wants to cut that wants to cut humans took to lower carbon the
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.520]  implementation of relocation programs for human settlements and
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.080]  infrastructure in high-risk areas and the implementation of policies aimed at
[11:22.080 --> 11:26.280]  climate stability and sustainable development see relocation then you go
[11:26.280 --> 11:30.800]  into the connected documents and it gets into forcing you out of your rural
[11:30.800 --> 11:33.840]  areas that they claim are sensitive because you know it's bad for you to be
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.920]  in those areas that are for the animals the rewilding and we have all the
[11:40.920 --> 11:44.640]  federal documents I covered this in 97 in my first film where they openly admit
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.840]  over half the US will be off limits over half of Mexico will be off limits
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.400]  they've already begun this in many areas where they put walls up on toll roads all
[11:53.400 --> 11:57.840]  the way up through Oklahoma into Kansas and Missouri where for 30 40 50 miles you
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.800]  can't get off the road there's ghost towns to both sides of you shutting off
[12:01.800 --> 12:06.480]  the rural areas is economic warfare and the McDonald's and gas stations are in
[12:06.480 --> 12:11.480]  the middle of the median every 20 30 miles you're not allowed to exit and
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.200]  and this is admittedly a control grid and they're going to put these up
[12:16.200 --> 12:20.440]  nationwide with these toll roads and shut everything down and then tax you to
[12:20.440 --> 12:25.600]  fund the regional North American Union Asian Union EU Union governments through
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.440]  it it's a total military takeover the feds built the roads as a military system
[12:32.440 --> 12:36.520]  the modern highway system the interstate highway system and now they're using it
[12:36.520 --> 12:44.880]  as a control grid side issue I'm gonna get into it more later it's just look at
[12:44.880 --> 12:49.600]  I've got WikiLeaks I've got Homeland Security seizing domain names ahead of
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.640]  the new legislation they're trying to pass that openly allows them no judge no
[12:53.640 --> 12:58.820]  jury to shut down any websites any free speech they want I've got TSA
[12:58.820 --> 13:03.680]  developments that are positive that are off the charts I've got Obama to freeze
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.920]  federal pay and to start cutting health care for troops I want to tell you
[13:07.920 --> 13:11.200]  what's behind that the overall austerity program a lot of folks are like
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.280]  why aren't you for that yeah after they rake back the trillion stolen by the big
[13:17.280 --> 13:21.960]  six banks and arrest those people and write off the debt to the foreign
[13:21.960 --> 13:30.080]  derivative speculators that's 99% of this literally it's 1500 trillion that
[13:30.080 --> 13:39.800]  that that is completely dwarfs by more than 99% do the math the trillions owed
[13:39.800 --> 13:47.520]  from federal workers and social security in entitlements and all of this now I'm
[13:47.520 --> 13:51.600]  against all that stuff because it was used to get us domesticated and they
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.920]  took our money and stole it but now that we're deep into this you don't cut old
[13:55.920 --> 14:00.080]  ladies who are already almost eating dog food or deciding between food and
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.720]  medicine you don't cut their chicken feed six hundred bucks a month on average
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.400]  that they paid into their whole life you don't do that and then let the bank are
[14:09.400 --> 14:15.800]  still trillions oh man I'm getting mad same thing happening in Europe right
[14:15.800 --> 14:18.960]  now that's why they're rioting they're cutting their pensions they're making
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.120]  them work more hours they're taking everything they got they're raising their
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.400]  taxes and it's all going to the bankers I got that news I got the North Korea
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.560]  stuff I've got incredible world economy news I've got Iran news and it's just
[14:32.560 --> 14:38.000]  it's all happening and it's just gonna get crazier from here on out it's gonna
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.880]  get more and more nuts we are now inside the New World Order ladies and
[14:41.880 --> 14:56.960]  gentlemen I hope you realize that every day I become more horrified that we were
[14:56.960 --> 15:00.680]  right about all of it and it's worse than we even thought in a way we were
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.440]  wrong it's worse than what I thought five years ago ten years ago fifteen years
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.720]  ago as I've said a million times it's one thing to intellectually know something
[15:08.720 --> 15:13.880]  it's another thing to start living it and to know to know it and if I could
[15:13.880 --> 15:18.720]  just take the knowledge I have and impart it to the average Joe like a
[15:18.720 --> 15:25.360]  Vulcan mind-meld or something you know I don't believe in that folks it's an
[15:25.360 --> 15:31.600]  analogy if and again I'm just an average person who discovered the globalist
[15:31.600 --> 15:36.200]  plans 17 years ago like millions of other people did and I decided I was
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.680]  gonna fight back I wasn't gonna roll over and you are listeners our supporters
[15:40.680 --> 15:47.080]  we are brothers and sisters together in this love of liberty and freedom and I
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.520]  see the attacks on the liberty movement those that understand the score I see it
[15:51.520 --> 15:57.520]  intensifying on every front and the dirty tricks against us behind the scenes
[15:57.520 --> 16:06.120]  are legion and it actually gives me energy and is buoying and helps me
[16:06.120 --> 16:11.040]  really focus and understand just how serious our straights are just how real
[16:11.040 --> 16:17.640]  this is and that's the good news it's not just Alex Jones who is having my will
[16:17.640 --> 16:27.200]  steeled or hardened my commitment redoubled and emboldened in the face
[16:27.200 --> 16:35.600]  of this I know the same thing is happening everywhere years ago I might
[16:35.600 --> 16:38.520]  have gotten chills once a week on air when I talked about something I'm
[16:38.520 --> 16:43.320]  getting chills constantly now you can feel the quickening you can feel this
[16:43.320 --> 16:52.720]  key battle between good and evil in the in the minutes before an intensification
[16:52.720 --> 16:58.720]  of the clash between corruption and good you could feel the energy crackling in
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.160]  the air and when I say in the minutes leading up to this minutes in history are
[17:04.160 --> 17:13.760]  years whole decades can be the blinking of an eye we are in such a critical time
[17:13.760 --> 17:19.000]  right now okay let me try to refocus here because Lord Monk that's coming up
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.840]  we're gonna get into the relocation camps the force rationing London London

[33:11.840 --> 33:41.360]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:41.360 --> 33:48.040]  okay if you watch my film the Obama deception now out for over a year and a
[33:48.040 --> 33:53.240]  half you notice we lay out that okay Obama's got a 70-something percent
[33:53.240 --> 33:58.560]  approval rating it's gonna implode he's gonna be demonized and blame for
[33:58.560 --> 34:04.080]  everything that's happened Obama is bad but he's only a mid-level frontman a
[34:04.080 --> 34:09.120]  lieutenant a teleprompter reader just like George W. Bush they want you to
[34:09.120 --> 34:14.040]  blame it all on Obama so they can put in their next fake right-wing leadership to
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.480]  try to pacify conservatives in this country and then four years to eight
[34:18.480 --> 34:21.560]  years later they'll be blamed for everything and the next group of
[34:21.560 --> 34:26.880]  puppets will be brought in this is very elementary and I know our listeners
[34:26.880 --> 34:30.800]  understand this in depth many of you better than I the general public is
[34:30.800 --> 34:34.680]  just now starting to get this that's why generally it took about four years
[34:34.680 --> 34:40.400]  historically if you looked at the political landscape and the sociology
[34:40.400 --> 34:45.760]  of not just this country but other nations it took four years six years
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.000]  eight years for people to figure out if somebody was a scammer now it takes
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  months for a politician that doesn't deliver on what the population wants and
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.200]  what is fair and what is constitutional it takes months for people to wake up
[35:02.200 --> 35:06.120]  and that's why the system is so scared right now and trying to sew up their
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.720]  police state grid because now they know they can't just flim flam you and
[35:09.720 --> 35:15.160]  bamboozle all of us with their bait and switch their tag team operation so
[35:15.160 --> 35:19.840]  they're accelerating the iron fist takeover they are removing the velvet
[35:19.840 --> 35:24.040]  glove they're trying to accelerate the economic collapse while telling you that
[35:24.040 --> 35:28.200]  it hasn't happened they're trying to start wars that will be used as a
[35:28.200 --> 35:34.320]  political distraction they're doing a lot of things but what did I go crazy
[35:34.320 --> 35:42.400]  about last Tuesday here on air it was that Reuters article and in the Reuters
[35:42.400 --> 35:48.920]  article they had government officials service in Ireland saying we believe
[35:48.920 --> 35:53.920]  foreign banks should own and run Ireland and this is the solution to our
[35:53.920 --> 36:00.360]  mismanagement JP Morgan Chase Bank of America international subsidiaries
[36:00.360 --> 36:08.880]  Wells Fargo City Bank you know the usual suspects Bank of England they
[36:08.880 --> 36:14.520]  engineered the whole thing they sold the derivatives to Ireland and then they
[36:14.520 --> 36:23.040]  ball face come out and say in the news foreign banks should own Irish banks in
[36:23.040 --> 36:28.080]  fact guys I forget the headline will you search Reuters foreign banks should own
[36:28.080 --> 36:32.240]  Irish banks and that will pull it up I forget the exact headline it'll pop my
[36:32.240 --> 36:34.680]  head the point is I don't want to just make that claim and not show it to you
[36:34.680 --> 36:38.080]  again here on prisonplanet.tv and for radio listeners I want to give it to
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.920]  you because that that will just show you how they're now out in the open with
[36:41.920 --> 36:47.160]  this just like they did Argentina just like they did countless other nations so
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.720]  they come in over several decades they get people on welfare they get people
[36:51.720 --> 37:03.760]  dependent they take people's paychecks and take part of it and they invest into
[37:03.760 --> 37:12.080]  a government pension so now you basically feel reliant on them now you're
[37:12.080 --> 37:15.200]  dependent and they found a BBC not a Reuters we put it back up for me go ahead
[37:15.200 --> 37:19.560]  and print that or is that Reuters at BBC pop that back up it says Irish
[37:19.560 --> 37:23.320]  Republic banks for sale the Republic of Ireland's top banks bailed out by the
[37:23.320 --> 37:27.240]  government at huge cost during the downturn should be sold the head of the
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.800]  country central bank has said as far as I'm concerned there for sale the Irish
[37:31.800 --> 37:36.480]  government yeah that's the same guy does he go on in there and I guess they've
[37:36.480 --> 37:40.160]  got the same quote where he says foreign banks should own us that's the guy but
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.200]  it's from Reuters it's got his disgusting quote you know he and he's the head
[37:44.200 --> 37:50.160]  swindler there in Ireland meant to now transfer fully Ireland to not the
[37:50.160 --> 37:54.360]  British not some foreign government not even the EU but to the private IMF and
[37:54.360 --> 37:56.760]  World Bank
[37:59.560 --> 38:05.160]  yeah there it is I've been an advocate for many years of the value of small
[38:05.160 --> 38:10.640]  countries to have foreign owners of their banks I mean yeah that's it on BBC
[38:10.640 --> 38:15.840]  as well's got his quotes print that for me I mean this is brazen
[38:20.760 --> 38:26.880]  I saw a YouTube video somebody posted or I flipped out about this yet last week
[38:26.880 --> 38:29.720]  and kind of yell a little bit people said this guy's nuts he shouldn't be
[38:29.720 --> 38:33.600]  getting angry folks it's a normal response to see the banking head of
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.880]  Ireland who openly they were told oh Ireland's this big boom economy oh
[38:38.880 --> 38:42.200]  they're going into deep debt oh they're buying derivatives oh they're
[38:42.200 --> 38:47.640]  unstoppable oh Irish vote for EU entry the Irish say no so they bring it back
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.120]  oh your economy's gonna be great they bring them under EU control so they've
[38:51.120 --> 38:57.440]  signed a treaty to agree to go under foreign banking ownership the EU is
[38:57.440 --> 39:04.520]  just the governmental receivership arm and now they go under EU control just a
[39:04.520 --> 39:08.440]  few months ago and boom oh my god your economy's dead we've got to raise your
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.120]  taxes we've got to cut your pensions we've got to totally take over every
[39:12.120 --> 39:18.760]  facet of your society now what do we cover in the Obama deception put out
[39:18.760 --> 39:26.760]  what 20 months ago yeah 20 months ago and we lay out that these bailouts aren't
[39:26.760 --> 39:30.520]  bailouts these are banker takeovers we show where in Europe and the US and
[39:30.520 --> 39:33.800]  Canada and every other country these people run it gives them unlimited funds
[39:33.800 --> 39:37.560]  no one can know where the money went it shows the bankers in Europe and the US
[39:37.560 --> 39:41.280]  saying we won't tell the parliaments in Congress where the money went just again
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.280]  brazen naked criminal bank robbery in front of you but they're wearing fancy
[39:46.280 --> 39:49.680]  suits and they got bald heads and they speak with distinguished you know
[39:49.680 --> 39:53.920]  manners and so they must be good guys you know Ted Bundy talked nicely the
[39:53.920 --> 40:00.400]  young ladies when he get him in his car he wore a suit too but if the American
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.080]  psychos wearing a suit ladies get in the car with him America get in the car
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.720]  with him I mean again this is total crime out in the open and we told you in
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.080]  the Obama deception that's why this film is evergreen it's more important now
[40:14.080 --> 40:18.800]  than 20 months ago when I raced to release it when the FBI showed up here
[40:18.800 --> 40:23.040]  trying to shut it down when I was getting death threats every day before it
[40:23.040 --> 40:29.200]  came out because they know I know and they know the films are measured and
[40:29.200 --> 40:32.720]  focused and slick compared to the show where I just let it all hang out they're
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.160]  scared of them it's been seen over 30 million times they got a reason to be
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.960]  scared 30 million times for free online you bet they're scared and again because
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.360]  the film lays out the austerity what would happen two years after in the US
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.560]  how it would start in Ireland and Portugal and Greece we name the
[40:51.560 --> 40:56.720]  countries with the Economist we interviewed Tarpley and others Gerald
[40:56.720 --> 41:07.200]  Salente George Humphrey Economist we lay it all out in the film how it's planned
[41:07.200 --> 41:11.960]  how do we know 2002 the IMF and World Bank documents get leaked the BBC
[41:11.960 --> 41:19.600]  publishes them I go into red alert mode for years warning you again they've
[41:19.600 --> 41:22.920]  told us what they're gonna do so what you see happening in Ireland as I've been
[41:22.920 --> 41:27.080]  telling you the last few months is gonna spread to Greece it's gonna spread to
[41:27.080 --> 41:36.720]  Portugal it's again it's gonna intensify Spain then France then England then
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.880]  Germany well guess what it's in the news today that Germany is in danger of total
[41:41.880 --> 41:46.280]  collapse of course that's how this is designed they hold you hostage give us
[41:46.280 --> 41:49.920]  more give us more money give us more power give us your infrastructure give
[41:49.920 --> 41:54.080]  us your highways give us your waterways give us your parkland give us the 600
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.160]  plus Greek islands and then they publicly give islands worth billions of
[41:58.160 --> 42:01.960]  peace there's hundreds of islands around Greece to the private bankers they
[42:01.960 --> 42:06.920]  don't just give them to the banks they give them to the heads of the banks oh
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.600]  this head bankers owed three billion by Greece he's now being given this island
[42:11.600 --> 42:16.920]  and it's some giant island with lavish government buildings all over it I mean
[42:16.920 --> 42:21.880]  now now we openly give were so conquered by these crooks that the islands are
[42:21.880 --> 42:27.360]  given to them I read the legislative reports out of Congress and out of
[42:27.360 --> 42:31.480]  Kentucky when they did investigations in the mid 90s about how the UN openly was
[42:31.480 --> 42:35.400]  taken over parkland and buffer zones not just in the US but in every major
[42:35.400 --> 42:40.400]  nation as collateral on the global debt why do you think the Chinese have been
[42:40.400 --> 42:43.600]  given almost all the major ports along with the Arabs and the infrastructure and
[42:43.600 --> 42:49.680]  the roads and the oil fields in Texas I was talking to Mike Hansen down in
[42:49.680 --> 42:52.960]  Gonzales County down there where he lives now he just said there's Chinese
[42:52.960 --> 42:56.480]  everywhere and just huge drilling rigs they just own everything I mean it's
[42:56.480 --> 43:06.720]  just it's a complete joke it was in the Houston Chronicle just just one lease
[43:06.720 --> 43:12.640]  they did was 600,000 acres a few weeks ago because they got all our money because
[43:12.640 --> 43:15.960]  they because we were set up by the globalists the globalists in the 70s
[43:15.960 --> 43:19.800]  made the decision to move their base of operations to China now we're being
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.200]  demonized with all the WikiLeaks information America's being blamed for
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.480]  all the evils of the world and yes we've been the engine of it we've been the
[43:27.480 --> 43:32.880]  evil mind-controlled robot carrying it out but the globalists are offshore see
[43:32.880 --> 43:42.160]  how they've set all this up exactly as we've laid out and so we told you this
[43:42.160 --> 43:45.000]  is now coming to the United States and now that's in the Wall Street Journal
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.040]  today and the New York Times on Sunday that is the US next and now the
[43:50.040 --> 43:55.480]  announcements are being made first they start laying off 20% 40% 60% in some
[43:55.480 --> 44:00.040]  counties the sheriff's deputies then the police start announcing in Oakland and
[44:00.040 --> 44:06.600]  other cities we won't respond to regular crime home invasions cars being stolen
[44:06.600 --> 44:12.280]  remember all those dozens and dozens well what was the headline 30 crimes they
[44:12.280 --> 44:16.000]  won't respond to in Oakland that was what the MSNBC headline if I go from
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.400]  memory serves let's let's check my memory just like we just checked that
[44:21.400 --> 44:29.280]  head of the the Irish banking system that the government minion and I'm you
[44:29.280 --> 44:33.520]  know I read the quote it was exactly as I said let's pull up crimes Oakland
[44:33.520 --> 44:36.680]  police won't respond to that should pull it up I mean you're talking about
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.880]  muggings you're talking about everything but but here's the deal in many cities
[44:40.880 --> 44:46.040]  they're not laying off cops they're hiring more but admitting I saw a story
[44:46.040 --> 44:51.480]  out of Ohio where they said oh there'll be three sheriffs out of the 44 in the
[44:51.480 --> 44:57.440]  county three sheriff's deputies one per shift will be for robberies or for
[44:57.440 --> 45:03.480]  car wrecks and all the rest will be for revenue generation that's what this is
[45:03.480 --> 45:07.600]  just a hellish world with armed government bureaucrats there to do
[45:07.600 --> 45:15.000]  nothing but suck off of us and not help us see my mind my memory fails these
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.120]  days folks I'm sorry 44 situations that his officers will no longer respond to
[45:20.120 --> 45:23.640]  see I'm sorry people always keeps me exaggerating and it's almost always the
[45:23.640 --> 45:27.680]  opposite it's 44 the police chief case of press conference go back up at the top
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.840]  was my memory right about that being MSNBC I was right about that bingo all
[45:33.840 --> 45:39.840]  right at least I got that right all right ladies and gentlemen the issue here
[45:39.840 --> 45:50.880]  is this is austerity this is the total takeover of society and they're gonna
[45:50.880 --> 45:57.560]  cut off everything because that's in the IMF World Bank leak documents that they
[45:57.560 --> 46:02.320]  want to make everything fall apart so lawlessness increases increases
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.440]  everything falls apart then they come in with even more control Argentina just
[46:07.440 --> 46:11.320]  80 years ago was more wealthy on average in the United States it was the richest
[46:11.320 --> 46:17.120]  country in this hemisphere as riches in Argentine was the saying now Ted
[46:17.120 --> 46:26.040]  Anderson went down there last year on his honeymoon and he said that it's not
[46:26.040 --> 46:29.480]  like American homeless who are generally mentally ill or drunks or drug addicts
[46:29.480 --> 46:34.080]  but that it was good-looking families with children living in doorways
[46:34.080 --> 46:40.240]  everywhere I mean remember the Washington Post in 2001 describe what the
[46:40.240 --> 46:43.400]  writers saw just one weekend of the collapse engineered by the IMF World
[46:43.400 --> 46:49.320]  Bank that an 18-wheeler pulling a cattle topped over there was plenty of food
[46:49.320 --> 46:53.240]  but nobody had money to buy it and the 18 because they shut the banks down and
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.240]  took everybody's bank accounts and the 18-wheeler topped over and people like
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.960]  zombies in in business suits you name it dirty with dirty faces ran out and with
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.680]  knives were slicing blobs off the dead cattle gobbling raw meat like hungry
[47:09.680 --> 47:19.000]  wolves the jewel of South America Argentina turned into a cesspit of crime
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.880]  and murder and degradation in a matter of days never re-emerging a decade
[47:24.880 --> 47:31.200]  later that's what the bankers will do you understand that they will give you no
[47:31.200 --> 47:37.640]  quarter they'll hang out in London and Switzerland and Riyadh Saudi Arabia and
[47:37.640 --> 47:43.000]  and they'll hang out in Tel Aviv Israel and they'll hang out in Tokyo and they'll
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.640]  hang out in Beijing they'll hang out in Paris you know living in their 50
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.440]  million dollar apartments and their 400 million dollar palaces laughing at you
[47:53.440 --> 47:59.280]  the entire time they love it they hate you they're ruthless they're Ponzi scam
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.120]  artists whose families have taken over this world through fraud and now it's
[48:04.120 --> 48:08.920]  coming to the US and they've got all these Republicans like the governor of
[48:08.920 --> 48:13.520]  New Jersey who they sell like he's the second coming of Christ because he's
[48:13.520 --> 48:19.600]  cutting infrastructure he's cutting government pay all of that would be fine
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.280]  if we were trying to get out from under these globalist but that's again of the
[48:23.280 --> 48:26.600]  1.5 and it's grown in the last year since we did the breakdown with multiple
[48:26.600 --> 48:30.360]  economists even again the Washington Post admits 600 plus trillion but it's
[48:30.360 --> 48:34.560]  more like 1.5 quadrillion impossible black hole hundreds and hundreds of
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.760]  times all the real assets in the world impossible to pay back designed to be a
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.240]  black hole you can't get out of that I can't get out of they know exactly what
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.360]  they're doing and so they're announcing they're gonna cut the veterans
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.640]  pensions they're gonna cut the veterans health care this is all mainstream news
[48:51.640 --> 48:55.560]  today they are gonna cut and freeze first they're gonna freeze then cut
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.760]  federal workers yeah even though federal workers a lot of them are lazy pig
[49:00.760 --> 49:05.280]  like Obama doubled the amount in the last year and a half that are paid over
[49:05.280 --> 49:10.600]  $150,000 even though it's bloated not a control at least those people get the
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.440]  paycheck and put their kids in school go to the mall buy cars pay the long guy
[49:16.440 --> 49:20.240]  that's some money that hits the economy not these offshore bankers that get the
[49:20.240 --> 49:26.600]  trillions so they're gonna focus in on a small piece of the puzzle oh it's a big
[49:26.600 --> 49:30.840]  piece on budget but but but not on the comprehensive annual financial reports
[49:30.840 --> 49:37.080]  state federal local not the commitments that have been made not the 1.5
[49:37.080 --> 49:42.120]  quadrillion they're gonna talk about a few trillion over here ah 14 trillion or
[49:42.120 --> 49:46.960]  whatever that's currently owed most of that to the bankers as well not just the
[49:46.960 --> 49:53.280]  leveraged 1,500 plus trill see they're talking about 14 trill folks you it's
[49:53.280 --> 50:03.160]  1.5 it's 1,500 trillion comprende folks comprehend that there is no paying it
[50:03.160 --> 50:07.080]  back that's why every time there's a quote bailout of a country it only gets
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.520]  worse a few months later because this is a designed process they go you want
[50:11.520 --> 50:14.920]  your pension funds don't you want we're gonna cut them but you better let us
[50:14.920 --> 50:18.640]  raise taxes and have austerity or you won't get anything instead of just
[50:18.640 --> 50:22.720]  arresting these people and setting up real monetary systems and writing off
[50:22.720 --> 50:26.560]  the debt to these private bankers that engage in fraud you do that or it's over
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.080]  now what's been announced today White House official Obama to freeze pay for
[50:31.080 --> 50:36.480]  federal workers for two years New York Times Gates seeking to contain military
[50:36.480 --> 50:41.720]  health cost secretary of defense wants to cut pensions and health care remember

[50:46.820 --> 50:50.360]  insurance proposal more showdowns what remember he already tried to make
[50:50.360 --> 50:56.960]  veterans pay for their own insurance folks that's chicken feed giving them

[52:15.440 --> 52:19.440]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.200]  control the United Nations would take over America the tri-lateral Commission

[54:28.560 --> 54:35.080]  animals they literally rot to death in many cases of bed sores gain green there
[54:35.080 --> 54:40.880]  have been cases all over the country where flies go into the veterans
[54:40.880 --> 54:46.800]  nostrils into their sinus and lay eggs the the maggots then have a meal of
[54:46.800 --> 54:53.040]  their brain that's happened in Virginia that's happened in Kansas you think I'm

[55:03.160 --> 55:10.080]  make this stuff up so that's where it's all going your taxes are gonna go up and
[55:10.080 --> 55:15.360]  then you are going to pay more money to the government and you're gonna get less
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.800]  back and that's all being announced in the news today and later in the next
[55:19.800 --> 55:24.840]  hour I want to get into this yesterday I ended up watching I rarely watch
[55:24.840 --> 55:31.160]  mainline television I end up watching an hour-long program ABC News this week you
[55:31.160 --> 55:38.920]  can just Google this week transcript the giving pledge and it is a softball
[55:38.920 --> 55:46.240]  worship piece of complete deception and I noticed all the ads for upcoming ABC
[55:46.240 --> 55:52.680]  shows were like how to destroy the family how the family's bad just just all
[55:52.680 --> 55:57.720]  pro-globalist but I watched it and it was just unbelievable they proposed
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.200]  national compulsory service in the piece Ted Turner did that you have to go out
[56:02.200 --> 56:07.120]  and work for the government in the streets as a slave but it started with
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.320]  Warren Buffett only pays 14% tax well yeah because he's a billionaire they
[56:11.320 --> 56:18.960]  wrote the laws and but if you're making $200,000 a year you're paying a really
[56:18.960 --> 56:22.480]  about 40% they say it's 35 and then that's not counting the Social
[56:22.480 --> 56:25.960]  Security tax and all the rest of it and all the other taxes and now the feds
[56:25.960 --> 56:30.720]  are proposing sales taxes VAT carbon taxes I mean California's already passed
[56:30.720 --> 56:36.160]  it Austin's passed it they're doing it city by city and here they have Bill
[56:36.160 --> 56:43.640]  Melinda Gates Ted Turner Warren Buffett and I researched this back in 1997
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.480]  with Ted Turner said he was given a billion bucks what he did was take all
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.640]  his wealth put it tax-free or a large portion of his wealth he's the biggest
[56:53.640 --> 56:59.440]  landowner in the world private landowner outside of royalty biggest landowner in
[56:59.440 --> 57:05.840]  the US bar 9 he took a billion bucks and put it tax-free and then now the money
[57:05.840 --> 57:12.080]  operates in perpetuity tax-free and he only takes the quote profit from it this
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.800]  is on record this is what the robber barons did in 1906 with the Sherman
[57:17.800 --> 57:21.480]  Antitrust Act they promoted it like the robber baron families were against it
[57:21.480 --> 57:24.720]  but just like they promoted it like they were against the fellow reserve act of a
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.760]  few years later they later admitted they'd actually written it and so the
[57:28.760 --> 57:37.000]  Rockefeller the Carnegie the Ford all the big money went tax-free and what do
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.880]  they all promote globalism socialism collectivism because the ultra rich
[57:41.880 --> 57:46.600]  want to collectivize the grassroots wealth shut down the middle class so no
[57:46.600 --> 57:50.120]  one can challenge their monopoly of power that's what all of this is about
[57:50.120 --> 57:54.960]  it's what the farming and ranching food safety act is about written by big
[57:54.960 --> 58:00.880]  agra to shut down locals it's what all of this online censorship is about to
[58:00.880 --> 58:04.960]  shut down alternative media kicking the mainline media is hind in all of it is
[58:04.960 --> 58:09.960]  about monopoly and but they admit it yeah we want one's give me they admit
[58:09.960 --> 58:14.960]  eugenics in here but all soft soaped whitewash for the public it was
[58:14.960 --> 58:18.880]  incredible so here are some of the supposedly richest people in America
[58:18.880 --> 58:21.800]  they're just front operatives like when JP Morgan died it turned out he was
[58:21.800 --> 58:25.080]  worth almost nothing he was a front for the Bank of England what did the London
[58:25.080 --> 58:29.920]  Telegraph and BBC report a few years ago when Putin kept arresting oligarchs
[58:29.920 --> 58:32.800]  who were worth tens of billions it would turn out they were worth a few million
[58:32.800 --> 58:36.680]  and it was all the Rothschilds in England and own Russia I mean it's the same
[58:36.680 --> 58:42.480]  thing these are just front people giving their money to the foundations you are

[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.720]  meanwhile the border patrol has been ordered to stay 10 miles back from the
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.840]  border at least in Arizona we've confirmed that cyber news service but
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:09.160]  don't worry one of their internal checkpoints many many many miles from
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.760]  the Texas-Mexico border they had an internal checkpoint and they pulled over

[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:45.920]  all right continuing with the economy this is austerity and when they tell you
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.160]  austerity it isn't for the mega banking families the royal families the
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:55.200]  Rockefellers the ancestors of the robber barons who set up the Sherman
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.960]  Antitrust Act to actually make their money tax-free in foundations just like
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.080]  they broke standard oil into 12 and then 14 different companies but the
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.760]  Rockefellers still get the lion's share of the money you can search the Exxon
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.720]  Mobile minutes from just two years ago and on the board and see David Rockefeller
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:20.360]  there telling Rex Tillerson what to do and to get behind promoting man-made
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:27.680]  global warming that was mainstream news so they are now openly going to butcher
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:33.000]  this country seven ways to Sunday and we've got to stand up and say no now
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:41.040]  again they're having the neocons come out and cut government employees pay and
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.920]  the government's a bunch of parasites on average and they think of us as their
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:51.840]  food and at many levels I like it but I'm smarter than that no I don't want the
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:10:00.240]  government employees pay cut I don't want social security colas frozen I don't
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.120]  want that to happen because that will further shut down our economy a tiny
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:13.720]  fraction of your tax money goes to actually pay for the welfare system one
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.960]  point five quadrillion it goes to the offshore banks it's impossible to pay
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.720]  back if you don't deal with them I mean I mean here's the analogy both your legs
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.600]  are chopped off blood spraying out you're going into shock if a tourniquet
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:32.280]  isn't put on it immediately we will bleed to death now we've got a tiny paper
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.280]  cut on our finger and the government saying they're gonna put a mandate on
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.760]  that that's how big this Ponzi scheme is now the
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.080]  domestication the big government system is bad because they've got people
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.400]  dependent on this fraction what about half of the 14 trillion that's owed they
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.720]  say currently but the real debts 1.5 quadrillion globally they've got us
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.080]  bamboozled and we better stay in the system we better go along with it we
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.560]  better stay here in the casino and keep spending money we don't have to get out
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:18.160]  of it when it's mathematically impossible to do it and now in Greece in
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:25.000]  Portugal in Spain in Ireland and now in the United States they are announcing
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:34.280]  foreign banks to own everything BBC also in Reuters quoting him last week the
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.000]  Republic of Ireland's top banks bailed out by the government at huge cost
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.320]  during the downturn the government is just a receivership arm of the private
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.680]  mega-six banks should be sold the head of the country's central bank is said
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.600]  Patrick Honohan said and as far as I'm concerned they are for sale the Irish
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.840]  government will outline plans to reform the banking sector it's always more
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:05.280]  reforms into which it has pumped 45 billion euros or 61 billion dollars
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.400]  38 billion pounds it is getting a European Union-led bailout that totaled
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.880]  90 billion euros remember up just six months ago Ireland's great Ireland's
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.480]  wonderful globalism has been good for them come into the EU plan pass a law let
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.480]  the vampires in agree to let us take your country into receivership under this
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:29.920]  EU plan if you don't ever pay these bills boom you sign you sign the
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.320]  agreement and it's like a little mermaid when the little mermaid signs the
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.240]  deal with the sea witch she's got flotsam and jetsam her two eels the IMF and
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.600]  World Bank and she laughs and goes I've got you now you're my slave the Irish
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.080]  and the statistics show that they actually stole the election they didn't
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.360]  they voted it down the first time they fix the election it narrowly passed the
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.200]  second time Ireland anybody in your government that says foreign banks
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.720]  should own you is a traitor same thing for Greece same thing for the United
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:10.680]  States the Irish government will outline plans to reform the banking sector
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:15.400]  into which it has pumped 45 billion euros it's getting European Union-led
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.400]  bailout that may total 90 billion euros the International Monetary Fund will
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:27.960]  also contribute to the rescue package Mr. Honohan described the EU and the IMF
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:33.080]  funding as a kind of backstop for the banking system and they take German they
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:40.840]  take Dutch they take British they take French they take US taxpayer money they
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:49.000]  then go out and loan it to countries who've signed on to a mathematical
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  equation to offshore private banks it's impossible to pay back and then now
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.520]  they're in the news today and I've got it my stack announcing Germany may collapse
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:05.240]  the US may collapse whose necks is in England is it Portugal is it Spain and
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.360]  you watch they're telling the Canadians right now who are about a year behind on
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.680]  all this oh you're doing great because you're globalist and their prime
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.080]  minister says we've got to be part of globalism and give up our sovereignty if
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:22.680]  we want an economy that's how they hold you hostage I know it's been a lot of
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.480]  time on this and Lord Moncton's coming up there's a tube strike in England he
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.320]  was unable to get to his office he'll be joining us from the streets of London
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.960]  via cell phone that should be interesting we really appreciate Lord
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:39.080]  Moncton his wife just called us so it goes on stock markets around the world
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:43.560]  fell as a result of fears both of the bailout not a bailout it's a financial
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.520]  takeover may not resolve the republic's debt crisis of course it won't people can
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.640]  look at the math they go you they'll be deeper in that's the plan and that other
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.520]  countries with high budget deficits may be forced to ask for assistance forced
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.960]  disposal among the stocks hit hardest for Bank of Ireland which slumped 27%
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.040]  which again the globalist like and now when they do borrow more money it's a
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:12.720]  higher interest rate impossible impossible to pay back I've been an
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.960]  advocate for years of the value of for small countries to have foreign owners
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.800]  for their banks because the risk is carried by the foreign owners who make
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.120]  it up out of nothing and who leave us with the bill see they they're done
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:32.040]  goblin up Argentina and Brazil and Nigeria and and other third-world
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:38.800]  nations they're done goblin up Eastern Europe two years ago now they've moved
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.320]  on to Greece and Ireland then to Portugal then to Spain then to England then
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:49.480]  to Germany then to France gobble gobble gobble they're just going down the line
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:53.680]  what I've been telling you since 2002 that the IMF and World Bank are gonna
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.440]  target Western nations that's in the docks they're telling you they're coming
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:03.240]  for eight years I've been going red alert here's their battle plan it's a
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.800]  whole chapter in my book to send a tyranny now out of print it's at
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:19.240]  prisonplanet.tv a e-member version and it just goes into they are saying they're
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.920]  going to quote cut the Irish economy while increasing taxes and cutting
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:29.080]  pensions and and every time a nation starts going down I hear all the fake
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.440]  conservative pundits going look at those liberals their socialism didn't work
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:41.160]  it wasn't socialism in Ireland this isn't socialism this is fascism and I
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.240]  don't like socialism because it doesn't exist the globalist design it they
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.840]  promote it the mega rich want your money and they will build a big government
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:58.080]  to steal it I know I'm ranting I I mean they're announcing again they want to
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.520]  make veterans from grunts up to officers by their own insurance they signed a deal
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.120]  11 years ago with Prudential with the VA to steal the death benefits of six
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.040]  million dead and dying veterans from World War two through the current war
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:16.760]  that's Bloomberg AP they are announcing they're gonna freeze federal paychecks
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.600]  and you know what that's gonna do that's gonna make the fed squeeze even
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.880]  tighter for taxes because now their employees really think they're in
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.120]  trouble when that is a tiny fraction of the overall money what about the
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.520]  bankers what about going after them here's the New York Times Gates seeking
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.280]  to contain military health costs now the headline should be Gates moves towards
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.680]  cutting military pensions cutting military health care it's all in the
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:58.200]  article you know what I've looked at the math if we get rid of this fractional
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.160]  reserve banking system and don't pay these bankers all these trillions we're
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.920]  not gonna have this problem but I do think the government's out of control the
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:09.560]  big government is was created to rob us so we've got to cut the size of it don't
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:15.440]  get me wrong but listen deal with the banksters first don't let them bring in
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.040]  austerity raise our taxes and so that almost all the money goes to them get
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:25.680]  the word out to the military get the word out to the veterans explain to them
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.000]  what's happening why do you think Homeland Security internally says their
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.800]  number one enemy is veterans that's a fact my act Homeland Security reports of
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:49.920]  over a year ago 95% of it is for patriots they're doing this they're doing
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:57.120]  this because they have assessed you they know that when they try to raise the
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.400]  taxes on your little farm so much you can't pay it that you're gonna go postal
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.240]  you're gonna go postal on the people that come and try to take your farm oh
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.840]  maybe only one out of ten are gonna do it but they know it's the vets that are
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:16.040]  gonna do it and if one out of ten of millions of family farms fight it's
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.280]  over so they're spying on you they're watching you they profiled you and they've
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.640]  all even little towns have created huge SWAT teams and are training them to go
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:32.760]  after you they federalized them this is a secret police total takeover this is
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:41.040]  the real deal the real deal this is toe-to-toe face down with pure evil the
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.520]  average cop is dumb down just like the general public we got to reach out these
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.320]  men and women now and explain all this to them and say listen do you really want
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.680]  to be part of this I mean do you really because when they're done with you when
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.560]  when they're done using you after the public they're gonna take your pension
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.960]  fund they're gonna take your brother's farm they're gonna take your mama's

[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.400]  back to his office to come on with us from work and he shut down so he'll be
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.600]  joining us from some I guess the side of the road or down in a tube station in
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:41.280]  England but his information is always very informative we've got key intel on
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:48.520]  that front coming up I did want to just spend a few minutes reminding folks that
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.560]  the the the public is ready to be awakened now like they've never been
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:58.960]  folks now know things are serious and even the New York Times admits that
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:03.920]  this is one of the biggest stories in recent history with the TSA I'm gonna
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.360]  get to that later and they're very angry about it and it's admitted by many
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.320]  websites and publications that we initiated it our audience did drudge
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.680]  picked it up it's over 20 days he's carried our articles continually we're
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:27.000]  up there today with key intel and it shows the power that we have and the
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.600]  TSA and I confirmed this because Aaron Dykes and Rob do we're flying back from
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.840]  interviewing Russell means through Denver or just a month ago my employee
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.520]  Michelle her and her two daughters were molested is the only word by the TSA
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.960]  that's when that first broke on drudge none of the scanners were going no one
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:55.360]  was even being frisked that they saw so so there wouldn't be a rebellion and so
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.800]  the power of the people couldn't be demonstrated they just shut it down so
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:04.120]  that's coming up I want to talk about that but before we go any further that's
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.320]  why it's important that you go to info wars.com on the online video bookstore

[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:03.040]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:07.360]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:10.720]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.640]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.840]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:23.280]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:28.040]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:31.840]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:35.480]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.800]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.960]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.600]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:51.400]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:55.640]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.680]  lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.640]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.680]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:18.840]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.000]  developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system

[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:15.040]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:21.400]  the GCN radio network we are live we've only got him for about 25 minutes you're
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.360]  going to join us for a full hour from Cancun next week where they're having
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:31.160]  this UN meeting just as important as the Copenhagen event that was blown to
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:38.600]  bits politically by the leaking of the emails from East Anglia now a cascade of
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.720]  frauds has come out since then he's only joining us for 25 minutes because he's
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:45.840]  been delayed he is the deputy leader of the UK Independence Party Lord Christopher
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.760]  Monk and he's got to go to one of their events we've got to leave us early
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:53.080]  because of the tube strikes that hit London with around 70% of the stations
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.540]  closed around the network but he joins us to briefly in hindsight recap what
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:02.400]  happened last year what's happened since then and how important this new
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:09.400]  meeting is for the global neo-futalistic socialist takeover of all infrastructure
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.040]  is that we face and then I want to talk to Lord Monkton after he gives us a
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:19.200]  quick briefing on this about the special climate change program to be
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:25.040]  discussed at in Mexico executive summary it actually states forced relocation of
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:32.160]  populations basically into a work zone so this is off the charts meanwhile the
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.280]  telegraph reports today cancun climate change summit scientists call for
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:42.800]  rationing in developed world so this is real concentration camp type control
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.000]  we've had a lot of their top leaders openly say that they are green Nazis in
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.800]  their own words that they want authoritarianism you cannot overstate
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.360]  how wicked they are Lord Christopher Monkton of science and public policy
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:01.840]  dot org is the third Viscount of Monkton and Brentially and he really needs no
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.400]  introduction here thank you for joining us sir well I think that's always a great
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.800]  pleasure to be with you and yes you've just given a very good summary of some
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.080]  of the things that the usual suspects are trying to cook up at cancun and you
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:19.960]  will have seen over the last few weeks a certain amount of propaganda about how
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.240]  nobody expects very much of a result etc etc they're talking it down where they
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:28.080]  talked up Copenhagen well they talked up Copenhagen which was the climate
[01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:32.800]  conference this time last year again intended to establish a world government
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:38.440]  treaty that one failed utterly so now they're trying to pretend that nothing
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.400]  very much is going to happen when in fact they've been very quietly over the
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:48.760]  last year drafting an extremely detailed treaty under the supervision of the
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:53.920]  German government having several meetings in Bonn and so now they're
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.800]  ready to put that treaty to the leaders of the world and try to persuade them
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:04.720]  that they should back this treaty and go along with it so cancun could yet be the
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:09.000]  moment at which world government finally comes into place and you're quite
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.840]  right in parallel with that official activity there are the so-called groups
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:17.840]  of scientists of course they're not in fact scientists these are Marxists from
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:23.000]  the political extreme left who pretend that they are scientists and what they
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.560]  are trying to do is to raise the profile of the cancun talks by suggesting all
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:36.680]  sorts of lunatic measures like forced resettlement of populations concentration
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.040]  camps almost as you rightly said this is kind of thing some of them have been
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:44.040]  talking about and the latest notion which appeared in the telegraph today
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:48.520]  food rationing in the West and of course these these are all measures which
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.960]  socialists and communists will be well familiar with but which people who live
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:58.040]  under free markets tend to not to go along with and but no doubt that this
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.560]  scene setting is a deliberate attempt first of all to raise the profile of
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:09.920]  the cancun talks but also by stating things far more extreme than cancun that
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.640]  will actually get around to doing to try and make whatever comes out of cancun
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.520]  seem reasonable so that we almost breathe a sigh of relief when the world
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.280]  government takes over so it's a very careful piece of news management but
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:30.440]  underlying all this there is no basis in science for spending a single cent on
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:36.880]  trying to make global warming go away absolutely no basis for it there has
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.680]  been a continuing and now rapidly increasing stream of papers in the
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.040]  scientific peer-reviewed literature you will probably not have seen a single one
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:50.320]  of them reported in any of the mainstream news media making it quite
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:56.120]  plain that there is no longer any basis for alarm about the climate and I
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.200]  recently went to the world federation of scientists annual seminar on
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:07.480]  planetary emergencies held at Eriche a wonderful medieval monastic village in
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.760]  Sicily and there were 250 of some of the world's most eminent scientists
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.920]  including several climatologists and there were five of us who did
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.840]  presentations saying the climate wasn't going to be a problem and each producing
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.320]  scientific research to show that and only two who said the opposite and the
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:28.880]  two who said the opposite didn't have any original scientific research to show
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.400]  they merely parroted the results of the UN's climate panel the IPCC trying to
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.360]  claim that you will get very large amounts of warming but in fact you
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.160]  weren't I talked to professor Richard Lindzen of MIT who knows more about the
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.880]  atmosphere than anybody else alive I said to him Richard means a very
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.560]  interesting conference this because here we've got a supposed you know so-called
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.520]  consensus which is actually against the consensus where tobe exists in the
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.520]  outside world I said what's going on you said it's very simple only a few
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.960]  dozen scientists and researchers worldwide have ever worked upon the
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.920]  question how much global warming will we get if we add CO2 to the atmosphere
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:17.400]  all the rest are simply taking the figures they're given by the few who
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.480]  have worked that and they said if it's this figure then it's all going to be
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:28.760]  terrible I mean if I can interrupt for a moment specifically though you are of
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.720]  the great field of people out there resisting this fraud and this tyranny
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:38.560]  the most prominent the most accurate reading science and public policy.org
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:44.520]  years ago interviewing you extensively last year where you laid out all of
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.640]  their specific frauds their specific reports they put out reports in mainline
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:58.120]  newspapers calling for your arrest you called the glaciation issues in the
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:04.000]  Himalayas with precision that it was just a fraud made up you called I mean
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.040]  from A to Z exactly what their fraud was and now in the last year that we had
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.200]  the one-year anniversary of the kickoff of Climate Gate just last week it has
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.160]  all come out but they've spun it with Pichari in the New York Times saying
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:21.680]  we're sorry we got it wrong it was a mistake but we know it wasn't a mistake
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:27.200]  it is it is a hoax of hoaxes for them to beat this drum that no scientist
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:31.440]  disagrees there is a total consensus when we know the consensus is on the
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:36.360]  other side saying it's a fraud so it would seem that they would have to be
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.160]  dead in the water but they're not California has passed the carbon tax
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:45.320]  the city of Austin has passed it areas of Europe are engaging in it can you go
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.080]  over some of the frauds that have taken place and and and where you see this
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.360]  group of tyrants in their attempt to seize the global economy and set up
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:58.600]  their world government I mean who's winning the ballgame
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.000]  look no doubt on the science the tyrants have lost that's why I say this key
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.520]  central points which I will just finish because it's a very important one is that
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.480]  all of those who this tiny few dozen who have worked on the question how much
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.400]  warming we get the ones that do it by playing with Xbox 360s and PlayStation
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.520]  and they do it on the you know on sort of computer games computer model they
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:25.680]  are the ones that say we've got a problem but they're not dealing with the
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:30.120]  real world all the ones who do it as I do by measurement and observation and
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.720]  then thinking about what we've measured and observed we are saying no there
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.680]  isn't a problem yes you'll get some warming but it simply won't be enough to
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:44.360]  worry about and so far it is we who are being proved right the main fraud which
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.320]  they still try to get away with is that temperatures are rising at a terrible
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:54.800]  rate and just earlier this year I had a guy from the BBC on to me said what
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:59.280]  questions would you put to Professor Jones at the University of East Anglia
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.000]  right at the heart of this climate case he's the guy that was producing they
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.080]  sort of trumped up temperature records for the world and he was right at the
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.280]  heart of this conspiracy he was then saying that's all destroy our data so
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.640]  nobody can check it he was saying he said emails to some of his scientific
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:18.200]  colleagues as extraordinary man but he was then interviewed because it all came
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:22.280]  out in public as a result of climate case and so the BBC put to him a question
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.880]  that I had given to him I simply said has there been any statistically
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:36.280]  significant warming since 1995 and his answer was no not really said there has
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:41.000]  been just a little but it's barely significant at best and so here we are
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.320]  now getting the truth because I told the BBC what the right question was to ask
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.960]  so all this stuff about how the world is heating up at an unprecedented rate all
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:57.520]  of that we now know not to be true and in fact at each stage the climate left
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.640]  the climate Marxist the climate extremist to call them what you will
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:06.160]  are being forced back and forced back from their original positions first of
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:10.040]  all they were saying we couldn't measure the increase of temperature at the
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:13.800]  surface then that didn't happen then they said well it'll all be happening in
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:17.680]  the upper air about six miles up above the tropics it should warm three times
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:22.720]  as fast up there as it does down here then we checked 50 years of temperature
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.320]  records for the upper tropos here in the tropics and found there have been no
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.520]  such tripling of the surface warming rate that meant it wasn't man-made warming
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.400]  that was happening then they said well the warming must be going somewhere
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.840]  because actually you know they had to admit that there hasn't really been much
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.640]  in the way of warming over the last 15 years since this topic became exciting
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:46.600]  in the public print and so now they're saying well the warming must be hiding
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:51.240]  in the deep oceans waiting to come out and catch us all by surprise the fact is
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:55.800]  the arguments they're now trying to produce to make it look as though we
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.960]  still have a problem are wearing very thin even on their own ears you mentioned
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.080]  the Himalayas recently it's now been admitted that they lifted the story
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:12.560]  about all Himalayan ice disappearing in the next 25 years from a report by a
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.160]  Marxist journalist quoting an environmental activist trend of his it
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.720]  wasn't a scientific report it wasn't peer-reviewed it wasn't published in any
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.720]  journal that is the kind of material which the IPCC the UN climate panel that
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:31.960]  we entrust with getting this stuff right is using and then saying that this is
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:37.000]  the sort of material we have to pay attention to yes yes lord
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.080]  it was saying that nothing wrong with this indeed the Himalayan ice really
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.400]  will be gone anybody who said it isn't he said is a climate denier and he's
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.720]  putting the planet at risk and now he's had to eat crow and admit that he got it
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.960]  wrong why didn't he do that a whole lot sooner and there's been dozens of these
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:03.120]  but I mean specifically I get these emails I watch television I see the
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:09.300]  globalist relishing when they talk about we have peer-reviewed journals you
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:14.120]  don't when it's a lie we have almost all the real peer-reviewed journals they
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:19.680]  just make up fantastical frauds and they relish going over these but in the
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:26.940]  time we have left I specifically want to get into what's coming up at this
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.840]  conference that you're gonna be reporting for us on graciously from
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:35.400]  Cancun, Mexico and how we the American people and others listening all over the
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:42.040]  world how we ensure that this scheming group of people seeking to seize control
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:48.680]  of the global economy how do we ensure that they are defeated right the first
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:54.120]  thing that your listeners should do and you should do it immediately I mean in
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:00.960]  the next 24 hours is to get in touch with your congressman and your senators
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:07.080]  and say to them that Fred Upton who is a Rhino the Republican in name and they
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.360]  should not be appointed the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.600]  now the Republicans have taken control of it because Fred Upton is a true
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:19.960]  believer in the whole global warming rubbish he votes for the Democrats on
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:23.800]  this as on practically everything else if he takes control of that committee
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:29.720]  vast amounts of damage can be done and indeed the world might yet find itself
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.800]  going under a climate tour in the world government and that one appointment is in
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:39.040]  my view that what could make the difference between keeping the freedom
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.240]  prosperity and democracy of the West and losing it the candidates against Fred Upton
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.040]  are Joe Barton the current ranking member of the Committee on the
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:52.480]  Republican side he's a very wonderful man from Texas I know him well love him
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:58.000]  dearly he's a terrific piece of work really magical man and he by rights
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.520]  should get this but another one called representative Schimkus who's also a
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:06.280]  candidate he would be very good I would I think Joe Barton would probably be
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:09.480]  better but Schimkus would be very nearly as good either of those
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.840]  would perfectly acceptable as chairman of that committee but Fred Upton who is
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.480]  not reflecting the opinion of the public party on this on many other issues he
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.280]  would be a disaster and he might work with the Democrats to see to it that
[01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:27.040]  somehow we got Congress to start legislating in this area where at the
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:31.560]  moment it has failed to do so get on to your senators in your congressman and
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:37.240]  tell them it mustn't be up it mustn't be up to also the alternative media that's
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.360]  now beginning to displace the corporate prostitute media we need to really
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.560]  report on what's coming up in the next two weeks that's absolutely right
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.600]  because the next thing is there is already a treaty in draft it no longer
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.400]  contains quite such explicit and open admissions that they're trying to set
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.880]  up a world government as previous treaty drafts did nevertheless it's now going to
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.380]  follow the approach that the EU took the European Union they did a little
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:08.520]  treaty here a little treaty there each one not adding too much to the one that
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.960]  previously happened but by the time you've done 40 years of this all our
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.000]  freedoms in Britain have gone five six of our laws are now made in Europe by
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.920]  people we don't elect and only one fix made in Britain by people we do that's
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.600]  how fast you can lose your freedoms if you have this kind of salami slicing
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.280]  approach to setting up treaties so very important therefore that you keep an eye
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.760]  on this process but what Obama is going to try to do he knows he can't get any
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.960]  treaty coming out of Cancun ratified in the Senate not after the Republican
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.080]  landslide but no way he can get it ratified by a free course of majority
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:51.480]  Senate what they will therefore try to do is to enact the Cancun agreement not
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:55.880]  of a treaty but either as US legislation if they think they can get it through
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.320]  both houses that would be difficult by a much smaller majority of the treaty
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:04.840]  would require of course or he will use the EPA and the Democrat states like
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:11.160]  California to enact the legislation round the back and that is what his plan
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.560]  is and the people at Cancun know perfectly well that they can't therefore
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:20.880]  call the Cancun accord anything like a treaty if they call it a treaty it has
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.000]  to go in front of the Senate where it will be treated all right the call of
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.240]  treaty Lord Monckton we're almost out of time I want to cover several other
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.120]  subjects we know this move towards world government is not just coming out of the
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.280]  UN and the club of Rome and you know these people that want to seize control
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:42.240]  of all energy production we also know that the big central mega banks are
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.240]  involved in financing this Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and a few weeks ago in a
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:54.400]  debate in the UK House of Lords Tory life peer Lord James Blackheath and when
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:59.200]  we played the video here said that a foundation X apparently has offered to
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.960]  give the UK 5 billion right away he said many other members of the House of
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:07.560]  Lords knew about it but it had kept its secret he has just learned of it with
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.520]  and basically their globalist who are offering to basically buy out the UK
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:18.000]  government what do you make of this on the heat on the heel sir of the BBC
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:24.440]  that I have here with the headline Irish Republic Banks for Sale and the and
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:29.000]  their finance minister saying he is in favor of foreign banks owning Ireland
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.800]  I mean is this not a takeover yes it is a takeover of a very serious one and
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.720]  there's no doubt that the big banks that you say the mega banks are right up to
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.880]  their necks in order this after Al Gore was on the board of Lehman Brothers one
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:45.560]  of the reasons why they went back is that he had put them into all this global
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.440]  warming stuff and they lost the fortune of it and so my advice to those mega
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:56.480]  banks is this is a scare which is so far collapsing that if you put any more of
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:00.040]  your client's money or your own into this you will lose it as financial
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:03.120]  institutions and you will also lose more than that you will lose your
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.520]  credibility with politicians and electorate and you will find yourself
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:11.520]  no longer being allowed to be make a bank you'll be broken up into smaller
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:17.200]  pieces so you can't endure this kind of you can't impose this kind of policy on
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:22.080]  innocent people anymore just because you want to profit from whipping up fears of
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:26.600]  global warming that have no basis in reality Lord Christopher Monckton have
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:31.320]  you heard as a British Lord have you heard about this foundation acts I've
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:35.960]  heard stories of this kind but I have no evidence either way so I don't think I
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.600]  can say anything very detailed about it there are several foundations that have
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:43.240]  that kind of money available I have some idea of who they are I know one or two
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:46.800]  of them are run by people who are true believers in the new religion of global
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:50.720]  warming and that they might well make gestures of this kind but of course five
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.040]  billion it may sound a lot of money to an individual but to a government like
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:01.440]  that it's it's very very tiny so I don't think that you can buy a whole
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:05.960]  government with a little of five billion yes sir okay I've got just a few final
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.680]  questions and we're gonna let you go you've been very nice to join us here
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.840]  today with the big tube strike going on in London that kept you from getting to
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:18.320]  your final destination continuing here from the special climate change program
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:23.280]  executive summary the blueprint of this meeting that starts here in just a few
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:26.560]  days that you're about to get on an airplane and travel to in the next few
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:32.120]  days in southern Mexico there in the Yucatan Peninsula they describe on page
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:39.040]  six a laundry list an implementation of sustainable agriculture livestock
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:43.360]  production system the eradication of measures that encourage environmental
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:49.560]  degradation that's any activity and cause GHG global you know greenhouse gas
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.400]  emissions yeah yes a greenhouse gas emissions and it goes on the
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.600]  implementation of relocation programs for human settlements and the
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:03.360]  infrastructure in high-risk areas and the implementation of policies aimed at
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.280]  climate stability and sustainable development I mean is this not outrageous
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:13.600]  in how brazen it is yes it's what they're trying to do is they're still
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:16.840]  trying to ignore the fact that the science has collapsed that's why I
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.840]  spent a little bit of time on this program explaining why we know the
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.720]  science has collapsed I did a very interesting experiment I took the greenhouse
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:28.520]  gases they were in 1950 as they are now I worked out how much warming there should
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.280]  have been if the IPCC the UN climate panel was right there should have been
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:37.600]  one and a half Celsius has only been 0.6 using the UN formulae leads to a huge
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.480]  exaggeration two and a half times over in the amount of women to be expected take
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:45.840]  away that exaggeration you take away the problem but sir sir we're almost out of
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:49.440]  time we're almost out of time we'll have more time next week but does this not
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:54.920]  illustrate that it's nothing but a naked power grab forced rationing relocation
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.080]  of populations I mean these people have really tipped their hand I know you've
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:03.120]  seen all the recent admissions where they talk about climate tyranny and
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.440]  they're in the London Guardian and everywhere else it admitting that it's
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:13.600]  an authoritarianism and saying it's good why are they so arrogant because they
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.160]  the penny hasn't dropped that the people won't stand for this very much longer
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:21.640]  people are fed up with this interference in their freedoms they're fed up with
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:26.280]  these people trying to take the world over at Cancun and Copenhagen and all
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.520]  these other places and very soon the politicians who go along with this are
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:33.240]  going to be flung out of office wherever it's already begun in America
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:37.200]  America was the first the Republicans came off the Kool-Aid 18 months ago
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.680]  decided they didn't believe in the science of global warming anymore they
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:45.600]  began with increasing confidence to say so as a result they won huge increase in
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.960]  the general election I know it was only one of the factors but it was an
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.280]  important one nevertheless and that is going to happen with increasing
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:56.720]  frequency around the democratic world no for democratic world doesn't play the
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:00.400]  rest of the world won't be able to play either and this entire scare and all the
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:04.360]  nasty world government policies that go with it will come to a sticky and not
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.760]  untimely end all right Lord Moncton we'll be speaking to you next week some
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:15.480]  time from Cancun at this criminal meeting in 60 second closing what are you
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.200]  planning to do when you're there and I've seen some of the videos from other
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.640]  meetings when they see you they literally run which again signifies the
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.400]  tide is turning that's right there's no doubt the people who should debate me
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:32.840]  won't do so the Cambridge Union Society one of the premier debating society in
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:36.320]  the world invited me to speak a few weeks ago on the climate they had to
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:40.000]  cancel because as soon as the people on the other side were told I was going to
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.400]  be there they said they didn't want to come they know that what they're doing
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:49.200]  is a lie they know that it is indefensible so all their try is is
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.920]  personal attacks on those of us who dare to say it's indefensible and they are
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:02.000]  now in open rampant powering cowardly retreat this is the end all right

[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:55.000]  Blair is now saying some news on that front later in the hour I want to get
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.160]  into this key report that I watched with horror yesterday in a hotel room in
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:03.480]  East Texas while visiting family where they're telling us that Warren Buffett
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:06.920]  Bill and Melinda Gates Ted Turner just love us and they want to give billions
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:10.280]  dollars to help us and our families of course when you actually study what
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:14.520]  they're doing it's a nightmare and it ties into the austerity the whole thing
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:18.440]  was we got to raise taxes on the rich meanwhile the mega rich are already
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:23.480]  offshore and their money's tax-free I mean it's such a scam I mean it's so
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:28.360]  sick to watch them but that's why ABC News and others have almost no
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.760]  credibility I mean even with the brain dead out there so that is coming up I
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:36.120]  want to get your take on just the quickening that's happening with the
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:42.240]  North Korea situation with the Iran situation with WikiLeaks I've got this
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:48.560]  really exciting TSA news that we're also going to be covering very exciting
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:53.560]  things on that front and we'll cover that as soon as we come back in the next
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:59.120]  second but right now let's get into this this is from info wars.com and we'll
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.720]  actually put this article on screen and show you the Patsy now the government
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:08.000]  will lie so completely we don't even know if this is true remember Hatari
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.480]  militia turned out the feds were leading the group and set them up they
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:14.600]  weren't planning anything violent you know one of the members said someday if
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.800]  this keeps happening we'll have to you know defend ourselves from the New
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:23.640]  World Order but with this guy it's the same story that we've seen a million
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:30.920]  times if you want to be technical hundreds of times 1993 FBI cooks the bomb
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.120]  trains the drivers lets the bombing go forward they literally found two guys on

[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.920]  records I mean literally the FBI had to teach them how to drive the car and they
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:48.520]  let the bombing go forward and that came out CBS News and New York Times you
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:52.600]  get Major Hassan at Fort Hood he's protected there's a drill he's talking

[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:42.320]  government that gets set up like 7-7 and 9-11 you get other cases where they're
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:45.720]  drugged out mental patients they get on planes you got other cases like the
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:50.640]  First World Trade Center bombing 93 and this situation with the Christmas tree
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:56.120]  bomber where they go out they find just completely out of their mind lunatic

[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.800]  and our freedom but also our Christmas trees or at least that's what the FBI
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:19.240]  and cops in Oregon would have you believe the FBI thwarted it attempted
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:22.960]  terrorists bombing in Portland a pioneer courthouse square before the city's
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:26.400]  annual tree lighting Friday night according to the U.S. Attorney's Office
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.640]  in Oregon and I will hand it to the U.S. Attorney's Office at least they just
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.160]  found a lunatic to justify their existence and didn't actually cook a real
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:39.120]  bomb and then let him blow it up now this could have been because other cops
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.760]  found out about it that happens a lot then they go ahead and call it off but
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.480]  there's a lot of the time they go ahead and blow stuff up but but at least the
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.160]  cops didn't commit the full crime of actually bombing something you know
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:54.240]  cooking this guy a real bomb stay there we're gonna come right back I mean it's
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:58.600]  every month we hear about this in Chicago in DC I mean they go out and find

[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:06.240]  bomb the Christmas tree and then bust him minutes before the tree lighting
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:13.080]  this 19-year-old Somali born US citizen had a little help from the FBI the
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:18.920]  arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation during which he had
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:26.000]  been monitored for months as his alleged bomb plot developed in a repeat of a
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.960]  now familiar pattern the FBI told him they were building the bomb they went
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:34.200]  so far as to travel to remote spot in Lincoln County Oregon where a bomb
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.720]  concealed in the backpack was detonated as a trial run for the upcoming
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:41.280]  Christmas tree attack that way they can show the bombing dinner on the news
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:45.960]  later and scare you the FBI eagerly assisted their clueless mark when he
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:52.520]  decided to shoot a video explaining his half-witted act the half went and the
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:57.320]  FBI operative agreed to meet in Portland where he allegedly told the FBI
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:00.800]  operative that he had written articles that were published in the jihad
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:04.120]  recollections an online magazine that advocated holy war against American
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:10.800]  infidels and assorted Christmas revelers his mentally disturbed fantasy
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:16.360]  fueled by the FBI's is reminiscent of the Christmas Day non-bombing attributed
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:23.000]  to Nigerian Abdullah Matala who was it was said planned to take down an
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.520]  airliner over Detroit in spectacular fashion by lighting his underwear
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:32.440]  according to the FBI of a David the underwear bomber absurd bomb plot began
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:35.880]  back in August of 09 it goes through the same story of him being protected by the
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:40.800]  US government ladies and gentlemen I would never do this but hypothetically
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:46.560]  any of us could go out with $10,000 get to know a local schizophrenic mentally
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:50.520]  ill person and I'll guarantee you you buy him enough drugs enough whiskey enough
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:55.320]  liquor you can get them to walk into a police station and detonate a bomb

[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  black Muslims that were going to wage war nationwide and overthrow the
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.320]  government and it turned out they weren't even Muslims they were Christian
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.840]  rastafarian street kids the oldest being 18 who were completely stoned out of
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:45.080]  their mind on marijuana and other drugs the government over two years got him a
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.920]  warehouse said I'll give you more money and drugs if you wear a uniform say your

[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:28.360]  so they can sit up there on the news and say we've got terrorist everywhere we've
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.480]  got to have naked body scanners we've got to have internal checkpoints but

[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:10.680]  you but the point is turned off then major newspapers we've got them all
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:14.400]  leaked linked in this article a whole bunch of papers called and confirmed
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:22.480]  that they turned off almost all the machines nationwide and it's not just
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:27.400]  present planet calm that pointed this out today also Politico did I told
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:31.040]  Watson Friday to write this story on Monday and he did turn over the weekend
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:35.400]  Politico New York Times they concurred the drudge report was the main catalyst
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.800]  drudge report calm for this and the headline is but but we were the blasting
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:48.280]  cap in the cartridge the drudge report was the powder and the round and the
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:52.440]  American people were the barrel that fired this salvo into the globalist in
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:58.960]  the info war drudge fought the TSA and drudge one is our article but but let's
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:07.240]  first look at this New York Times article a media false alarm over the TSA
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:12.520]  David Carr so he excoriates all the media now listen to this you have a
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:16.320]  squadron of mad scientists surrounded by supercomputers gathered in the
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:20.480]  laboratory to try to con conjure a single news topic that would blow up
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:26.760]  large they could not touch the TSA Pat down story see it isn't a squadron of
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:31.640]  mad scientists conjuring the biggest story ever it was this radio show kicked
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:35.800]  off a month ago day after day drudge only carried our stories than others
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:41.280]  picked up on it feeding frenzy and now they had to capitulate I told you a
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:47.040]  month ago this was a key enemy witness you are now the squadron of mad
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:53.000]  scientists how does it feel see the globalist have their mad scientists in
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.720]  media they're mad they don't control what the issues are they'd rather have us
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:00.360]  talking about Lindsay Lohan not real issues and they're mad the New York

[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:30.720]  alright finishing up with the latest chapter in the TSA in the New York
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:34.120]  Times wonders why they've lost all credibility these are the folks that
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:39.160]  helped lie about imaginary WMD's in Iraq these are the people telling us the
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:44.200]  sky's falling if we don't pay Al Gore billions of dollars for the privileged
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:49.600]  to breathe the the oceans are gonna rise and kill us and this article goes on to
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.240]  admit that this story is super gigantic but says it's all a fraud and that the
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:59.480]  TSA needs to stick their hands down our pants I mean it's just establishment
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:05.640]  tripe if a squadron of mad scientists surrounded by supercomputers gathered in
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:09.960]  the laboratory to try to conjure a single news topic that would blow up large
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:15.360]  they could not touch the TSA Pat down story and it goes on to say it began
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:19.760]  with a drudge report and then spread from there and I talked to a lot of my
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:23.760]  crew who came up separately Aaron Dykes and others and said that over
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:27.800]  Thanksgiving with their families and a lot of family that didn't even really
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.480]  know what their job is all they wanted to talk about was the TSA and how much
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:37.040]  they can't stand it look nobody likes it being barked at and having hands stuck
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:45.080]  down their pants or having to take out prosthesis or women I mean here's the
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:53.680]  report sanitary towel prompts TSA grope to sexual assault victim and then it
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:56.920]  links to the New York Times and all the cases of it I mean they literally call
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:00.080]  women aside and say what's that and the woman in front of everybody's got to say
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:05.720]  well I mean it's a tampon it's a it's a maxi pad I mean this is what this is a
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:10.160]  joke people what what more will you put up with it's like Ron Paul said last
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:16.400]  week it will put up with this will put up with anything when is enough enough
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:25.360]  when is enough enough when is enough enough when are we going to start
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:29.600]  realizing it's a fraud the illegal aliens are above the law folks they get to
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.000]  drunk drive they get to use fake IDs they get to do whatever they want but
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.720]  then Willie Nelson's arrested for Matt for some marijuana on his bus that's
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:41.960]  like Santa Claus getting arrested for having some presence in his in his bag
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:48.840]  you know in the sleigh a guy in Florida gets arrested for blocking putting his
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:52.920]  hands over his face while police beat him for no reason that's confirmed on the
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:59.960]  video and with a straight face they say yeah we're charging him I mean it's
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:07.160]  crazy foreign bankers get to steal tens of trillions of dollars they never get
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:13.000]  in trouble but Willie Nelson gets to go to jail the government local state
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.240]  federal gets to break laws constantly and just be above the law you know I was
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:21.440]  listening to radio this morning and shot the news of up in McKinney Texas a
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:27.240]  teacher spanks the kids with a paddle and they now are talking about just well
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.760]  they have suspended her will she get fired and the local talk show hosts were
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:37.160]  defending the paddling I've heard those very same talk show hosts talk about
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:41.360]  taking people's kids if their parents spank them it's not illegal to spank your
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:48.640]  children but but how does the government suspend a teacher over paddling
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:53.800]  people but then there's no discussion of the person even going to jail when the
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:57.160]  government will come and arrest parents who paddle their children when there's
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:01.280]  not even a law that you can't paddle you can't cause physical harm you could
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:04.760]  certainly discipline them I mean ladies and gentlemen back when people did get
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:10.080]  paddled by their teachers I remember in kindergarten in kindergarten no no first
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:16.320]  grade in first grade at public school not doing what I was told and a few times
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:23.560]  being taken in the teacher's office and shown a paddle and the third time that I
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:26.680]  didn't do what I was told a few months later I was given a paddling and believe
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:33.360]  me I didn't do it anymore I mean how did we go from 31 years ago Alex Emerick
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:39.240]  Jones getting paddled in the first grade but let me tell you the coaches
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:43.400]  figured out who were also the principals and teachers in Rockwall they
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:47.800]  figured out real fast that I didn't care about being paddled I was afraid of
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:51.740]  being run but because I was in sports they were allowed to run me and let me
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:54.920]  tell you running me up and down the bleachers till I threw up outside at the
[02:28:54.920 --> 02:29:00.600]  sports stadium you know instead oh no no we let the kids all go crazy and then
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:04.680]  the police come and taser them and take them to a juvenile facility where older
[02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:10.280]  youth rape them see instead of paddling people and running them till they throw
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:14.400]  up because that humans are just like dogs that's why we get along with dogs
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:18.080]  and a dog doesn't respect you when it's a puppy until you have placed it in
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:23.520]  shock you know in its place until you have let it know and you can paddle it
[02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:26.940]  with a newspaper that it that isn't even painful but it's the act of
[02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:32.720]  domination then it respects you and does what you say and appreciates it but by
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:35.800]  the time that dog grows up to be two years old you can beat it with a two by
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:40.880]  four it's not going to listen to you and the social engineers knew this they
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:45.440]  know that they train people not to do discipline when we're little so we turn
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:48.840]  into animals later and we got to have a big police state to deal with it but
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:52.720]  that's the double standard in government we're on the March the
[02:29:52.720 --> 02:30:02.080]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:05.840]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:09.600]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill

[02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:17.680]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:22.000]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.400]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:30.160]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:34.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:37.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar

[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:02.640]  signpost another mile marker that the mainstream corporate prostitute media

[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:21.640]  Hi Alex I have a I'm just wondering we gotta push for this F510 bill we can't
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:26.640]  let them take away our right to food I was thinking on a few angles on it
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:32.640]  one if they start putting all sorts of nonsense like animal things bug things
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:36.640]  in there the Jews should be going crazy on this how can you have kosher food
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:40.640]  anymore and the Christians should be going crazy on this because what about
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:45.640]  you know taking away our right to you know buy or sell type of thing well
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:50.640]  that's right I mean meanwhile the the FDA is approving in the process of
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:54.640]  approving GMO salmon that's that's part other fish and insect it shouldn't be
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:00.640]  able to be called salmon it should be called you know you know cloned
[02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:07.640]  hybrid creature chimera is what it's you know it's it's it's true name is and
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:12.640]  instead of that they're moving to not even let you know it's GMO it's like
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:17.640]  when corn is part insect it should be called insect corn but but meanwhile
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:20.640]  they want to take over all the farms and ranches and not let you even can your
[02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:26.640]  own food when all the big agra problems are from big mega agra farms not the
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:32.640]  small farms it's about a total clampdown on society one thing I also had an
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:36.640]  idea why not link three three stories together these three bills the 510 the
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:41.640]  one for obliterating our rights on the internet and also obliterating our
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:46.640]  rights to stop these banks from the fordulent things and put together
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:50.640]  something like how the democrats are trying to obliterate their party
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:55.640]  from ever coming back and some sort of fascism something like that maybe
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.640]  they'll get the idea that passing these bills is totally suicidal for the
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:05.640]  entire party well it is and I appreciate your call great points George look
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.640]  what's happening in the US is happening all over the world in every other
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.640]  country it's just different nations are at different stages and what you see
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.640]  happening in Greece and in Ireland with total takeover by foreign banks of
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.640]  their entire country their government their taxes being raised their benefits
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.640]  being cut that's now coming to the US with the announcement that veterans are
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:29.640]  going to have their insurance cut veterans are going to have their pensions
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:34.640]  cut government employees are going to have their pay frozen which again
[02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:41.640]  sounds reasonable the government is too big but you start with the mega bankers
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:46.640]  that's the lion's share you don't fix that nothing's fixed and I am for
[02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:51.640]  cutting government jobs period I am for freezing government wages including
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:56.640]  Congress but it's a stunt if you don't go after the banks now not giving the
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:00.640]  veterans health care when they signed the agreement and they were supposed to
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.640]  get it that is wrong and I'm against it but again the average you know neocon
[02:38:05.640 --> 02:38:09.640]  or liberal be like oh I bought phone cards for the for vets to call home on
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:14.640]  the holidays oh I put a flag out front my house okay great how about you
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:19.640]  really do something how about you really speak out about what's happening to
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:23.640]  the veterans okay not just put window dressing on it let's go ahead and talk
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.640]  to Michael in South Carolina Michael you're on the air hi Alex it's Michelle
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:34.640]  I'm sorry Michelle I'm looking away across the room that's okay I really have
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:40.640]  a desperate plea here because I've been an info warrior since the beginning of
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:45.640]  the year I my eyes were opened by the H1 in one thing you said go look at the
[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:50.640]  pamphlet I looked at the pamphlet I was shocked I'm known now around my town as
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:57.640]  the town crazy conspiracy yeah you know how to read the H1 in one flu shot
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:39:01.640]  insert that admits it can give you brain disorders Guillain beret cancer and hurt
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.640]  your fertility man you actually read the insert on a drug package this is
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:12.640]  horrible this is so incredibly terrible man you're some kind of dangerous nut
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:19.640]  wow well since then I've got movies I've got I've been spreading them around

[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:30.640]  some good some bad from that whatever I live very close to a very large tourist
[02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:36.640]  area in the United States right by the coast and during the summer time there
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:43.640]  was no to engineering stratospheric out of that aerosol spraying here about two
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:49.640]  weeks after school started they started hammering us with this daily in first
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:53.640]  they were doing it in the middle of the day then they started doing it at night
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:40:01.640]  and early in the morning about let me see the beginning of October my daughter
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:08.640]  started having seizures and we have no history of seizure disorder oh Michelle
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:14.640]  I'm sorry to hear that well Michelle you can pull it up just type into the search
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:19.640]  engine disorders of the brain neurological disorders skyrocketing they're now
[02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:23.640]  saying oh it's normal to get Alzheimer's when you're 25 it's normal to have
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.640]  narcolepsy and they admit the shots are doing that there's all sorts of bizarre
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:31.640]  spraying all sorts of chemicals in the water we are being soft killed and I'm
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:37.640]  so sorry to hear that how old is your daughter she's 13 and Lord she's having
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:44.640]  two to three seizures a day oh my god and they've got her on medication but
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:49.640]  it's not working I went to the neurologist with her and I said I wanted her tested
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:54.640]  for heavy metals and he almost threw me out of the office they're not allowed to
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:58.640]  check for heavy metals or what could actually do it the doctors have been
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:01.640]  federalized to a great extent more and more they're only allowed to prescribe
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:05.640]  drugs they're never allowed to actually it's like young girls going into puberty
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:09.640]  now as young as age three women having babies at eight or nine or ten years old
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:14.640]  now they're supposed to go in about 13 on average they admitted to bisphenol a
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:17.640]  when they go to the medical doctors they will not say get off bisphenol a or
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:21.640]  hormone lace food they tell them we're going to give you hormones now to mask
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:28.640]  the other hormone and then it causes all sorts of disorders has your daughter
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:35.640]  taken a lot of vaccines she did get the h1n1 before I found out my god out at
[02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:40.640]  school and they can cause an autoimmune well then it causes a wait wait the
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.640]  school didn't ask you they asked me yes but I at that time was a sheep and
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:50.640]  thought it was good so she's now having seizures and she's 13 yes sir and we
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:54.640]  don't know the cause my doctor as the neurologist has admitted he doesn't know
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:00.640]  the cause but he refuses to check her for heavy metals I've had to go to her
[02:42:00.640 --> 02:42:06.640]  family doctor and basically beg well man man man they've got all sorts of good
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:10.640]  clinics that have got nurse practitioners but also doctors over them and
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:16.640]  you just go in and say you know we I've read we might want to have her tested
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.640]  for heavy metals you just pay they take her blood and do it you know the issue
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:24.640]  is it's the mercury and I don't know her particular case but a lot of time the
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:27.640]  mercury is admitted it goes through the blood brain barrier because it's
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:31.640]  injected directly in and the other adjuvants the aluminum and other things
[02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:36.640]  cause an autoimmune response and dr. Blaylock we've got a video that will
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:39.640]  come out this week it was ready last week but it's coming out in the next few days
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:44.640]  dr. Russell Blaylock video he's got stuff on his Blaylock wellness site on
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:51.640]  ways to detoxify also you can try to stop inflammation is your daughter a big
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:58.640]  meat eater yes we need you know like normal we'll try to get her as much
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:05.640]  fish oil as you can and you get the types that are mercury free but fish oil
[02:43:05.640 --> 02:43:10.640]  you want to get her because you know the brain is 70 plus percent water but of
[02:43:10.640 --> 02:43:15.640]  the solid part the 25% or so it's almost completely cholesterol and so low
[02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:19.640]  cholesterol diets actually lower IQ and overall brain functioning a lot of folks
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.640]  that have epilepsy know this they're told to eat you know diets of high and
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:28.640]  certain key fats to total you know to boost brain density I don't want to
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:32.640]  get into medical issues I'm not a doctor but I've read the reports I would try to
[02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:38.640]  detoxify is she eating any MSG it's an excitotoxin is she eating any breath
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:44.640]  mints or regular sugar gun that has aspartame no I have since learned about
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:51.640]  and stopped with that we're on total bottled water that I make sure is you
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:56.640]  know the osmosis that that doesn't have any of the of the fluoride or anything in
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:00.640]  it but I just present as a closing statement here I just want to say that
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:04.640]  I own what in the world are they spraying I've been showing it to everybody I know
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:10.640]  and anybody out there that knows anybody that can stop this stratospheric
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:17.640]  aerosol spraying please please stop this we've got to stop this is hurting our
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.640]  children well that's the plan God bless you I'm so sorry to hear that they are
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:26.640]  spraying aluminum dioxide on us it's killing the plants to eliminate them all
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:30.640]  over the world is going off the charts in the in the in the soil samples and
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:34.640]  we're all being murdered right now slowly and it's the eugenicist that are
[02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:38.640]  running the show God bless you very hard to hear that call Michelle but we'll
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:42.640]  we'll continue to try to warn people about what's happening that's why it was so
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:46.640]  sick when I know that Bill and Melinda Gates fund eugenics I know they fund
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:50.640]  forced vaccine programs I watched on the TV show and ABC yesterday Gates with
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:55.640]  this maniacal smile giving an oral polio vaccine to a child went on record that
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:45:00.640]  you in program in Asia Africa and Latin America in the last year has been caught
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:05.640]  giving children weaponized live polio and he was like you know on the show just
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:10.640]  this weird smile putting in an Indian child's mouth I know his dad headed up
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:15.640]  Planned Parenthood I know he's a eugenicist I know Ted Turner's said
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:19.640]  get rid of 80% of the useless feeders he was on the show what a great
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:23.640]  humanitarian he is I know they put their money in tax-free foundations so they're
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:30.640]  only giving the profits it's just so sick I have a 13 page transcript here and
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:34.640]  there's just all these sickening quotes Buffett is giving more than 15% of his
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:39.640]  money to foundations started by his three children and his late wife they
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:43.640]  tackle issues like the environment family planning education and human rights
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:47.640]  yeah the environment taken over your property family planning abortion
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:51.640]  sterilization education that's corporatization of education total
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:57.640]  takeover human rights promoting police state Bill Gates this is a quote well
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:01.640]  we looked around and saw the greatest miracle that had happened on for everybody
[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:06.640]  on earth is the health had improved it not only save lives that reduce sickness
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:12.640]  let kids be able to learn but then also let stabilize the population wherever
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:19.640]  good health was created vaccines lowering population again this is just for
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:25.640]  the public but remember the times of London headline earlier this year elite
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:29.640]  meet in secret meeting to discuss over population that we should throw that up
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:32.640]  on screen guys so when they're really meeting that's what it's all about
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.640]  here's Turner because I want to set a good example president of Rwanda has
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.640]  passed a rule that on the third Saturday of each month the entire country has to
[02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:44.640]  go out from 8 to 11 and pick up trash including him in the cabinet Rwanda
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:48.640]  they all go out and pick up trash in Rwanda it's just as clean as a country of
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:53.640]  Switzerland show oh forced compulsory service like in the Soviet Union and it
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:57.640]  just goes on and on from there but but the whole thing starts with oh the rich
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:47:03.640]  want to raise taxes on the rich they don't tell you is they're the ones
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:06.640]  making money out of the derivatives especially Buffett he's part of the
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:11.640]  big six banks with Wells Fargo is one of the six so they want your tax money
[02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:16.640]  it goes offshore he pointed out he's only paying 14% tax why am I paying 40
[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:20.640]  then because only these billionaires are allowed to do this there it is billionaire
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:24.640]  club and bid to curb overpopulation it goes on to say the America's richest
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:28.640]  people net in secret see that's what they're really doing when you read the
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:32.640]  real literature but it's sold to the public of oh look what they're doing
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.640]  and they've got churches all over the town where I live raising money to give it
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:40.640]  to Bella Melinda Gates I mean they he admits they're coming out with
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:45.640]  mosquitoes that give you vaccines so you don't have a choice and pharmacological
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:51.640]  crops where it's in the crops oh so horrible talking to Michelle but if we
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:56.640]  don't talk about this it's just going to get worse and neurological disorders
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:00.640]  I mean they're just off the chart I saw a report over the weekend my dad showed
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:06.640]  it to me mainstream news AP that they're saying by 2020 half of America will have
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:11.640]  diabetes folks Americans ate more sugar and crud 20 years ago they eat now it's
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:19.640]  the it's the additives CNN admits that most fast food has silicone in it you
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:24.640]  know what silicone does to your kidneys your liver I mean you're going to blow
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.640]  your liver out might as well do it on Jack Daniels and enjoy yourself I mean
[02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:35.640]  it's bonkers okay bonkers Damon in South Carolina thanks for holding her on
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:42.640]  the air Alex how you doing buddy good I'm forever Williams myself I talked to

[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:47.640]  going to go to me at the end of the show and we had some technical difficulties
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:51.640]  but what I want to follow up with you on is I think they're going to warm these
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:55.640]  backscatters scanners back up real soon I'm a medical dosimeter so I work with
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:01.640]  radiation all day long taking care of cancer patients and basically a couple
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:06.640]  points I want to share with you one these TSA workers they don't have a clue
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:11.640]  when it comes to delivering radiation or the machines that go with it and if they
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:14.640]  start really up in the usage of these things all you got to do is have one of
[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:19.640]  those button stick with a zappia and you know you're going to be getting dosed
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:22.640]  in that little chamber and they're not even going to know what's going on and
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:24.640]  they're going to cook someone right there that's what's going to take is for
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:28.640]  someone to just completely get fried because they're like oh the image won't
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:32.640]  work and by the way the New York Times even admitted massive brain tumors
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:36.640]  confirmed from MRIs and people's hair is falling out everywhere because there's
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:40.640]  no regulation now and they're coming out with super high-powered ones and they're
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:44.640]  sticking I mean in every state you need a license to cut hair but you're going to
[02:49:44.640 --> 02:49:48.640]  let some shmuck at ten bucks an hour at the TSA blast you with radiation and
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:52.640]  you get free safety and you know the name of preventing terrorism that's
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:57.640]  beautifully said you got to have a license to sell lemonade or cut hair but
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:02.640]  you got people you know these these near minimum wage federal minions sticking
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:06.640]  their hands down your pants I mean TSA admits they hire the first if they
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:10.640]  need to fill 20 positions they've hired the first 20 applicants in the news
[02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:15.640]  mainstream news reports they're hiring sexual assaulters and stalkers that's
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:18.640]  who they want they're doing a great job vetting these people I'll tell you what
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:23.640]  now listen here's my other point you can buy man-made crystals that are used by
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:26.640]  these radiation monitoring companies all my coworkers and I have to wear these
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:29.640]  badges that show how much exposure we get every month because people who work
[02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:32.640]  with radiation are allowed to get a little bit more than the general public
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.640]  okay and they're called optically stimulated luminescence so little man-made
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:41.640]  crystals that if you expose them to radiation and then you develop it kind
[02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:44.640]  of like a film afterwards it'll tell you exactly what kind of dose you get
[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:48.640]  well I'm traveling to Europe this winter with my wife and what I'm planning on
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:52.640]  doing is getting some of these and I'm and they're really small and I'm going to

[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:31.640]  in constant sorrow of his day I am the man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:41.640]  all my damn look the issue is I've had radiologists on the show they've had top
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:44.640]  radiologists in literally hundreds of newspapers
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:49.640]  Janet Napolitano what a few weeks ago was in the news saying John Hopkins
[02:54:49.640 --> 02:54:54.640]  says it's safe and then I went and saw AP and AFP with the head of the John
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:59.640]  Hopkins radiology department doctor love saying this stuff is incredibly
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:06.640]  dangerous I mean they just completely lie I mean they even source people who
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:11.640]  said the opposite it's like Al Gore saying no one questions global warming
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:22.640]  there's a total consensus it's not true none of it is true and the issue is you
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:25.640]  can only get so much radiation in your life and if you're a frequent flyer
[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:29.640]  the doctors are on record this is bad finish up your point about the luminescent
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:32.640]  crystals you're gonna try to get a reading off of it yeah what I'm gonna do
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:36.640]  is I'm gonna order some of these and I'm gonna just do my own little personal
[02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:42.640]  study here and if they put me through it and I'm gonna get scanned going over
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:45.640]  and I'm also gonna be over in the former Soviet Union so if they have them over
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:49.640]  there I'm gonna see what they're dosing people with and then get them developed
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:53.640]  and then get a true reading because the TSA website says that it gives 10
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:56:02.640]  micro REM per dose per scan which you know the problem with that is you know they
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:05.640]  don't give the because they don't figure the public will know about it they don't
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:08.640]  give all the information as they're coming up with that number like your
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:12.640]  skin dose versus your eye dose I mean your eyes I mean you get cataracts after
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:16.640]  a certain amount of you know 20 a centigrade excuse me 200 centigrade
[02:56:16.640 --> 02:56:20.640]  you know to your lenses can lead to cataracts and that doesn't happen
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:23.640]  tonight that takes over year that's why people that work in reactors that are
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:27.640]  or nuclear subs get it even though it's supposedly shielded it gives you cataracts
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:32.640]  but but it's worse than that it came out even to the New York Times that it's
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:37.640]  20 to 50 times depending on the machine what they'd previously said and they're
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:41.640]  so they're just completely lying about this plus I've seen the TSA release
[02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:45.640]  photos have you noticed that when it shows the hands you can see the bones
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.640]  yeah I mean these images are not something where you're getting some
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:54.640]  little light dose they're totally full of it and they're not counting on someone
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:58.640]  like me to be awake you know after listening to someone like you and data
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:02.640]  the important point here is this they say that the dose you get from the scan is
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:06.640]  equal to about two minutes of flight time at altitude but what you have to
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:09.640]  understand is that you know 10 micro REM is about one thousandth of the
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:14.640]  allowable dose for the year so if you take it number that way well if you're on
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:18.640]  like I'm gonna be on a 10-hour flight over to Europe so every two minutes if
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.640]  I'm getting 10 micro M at altitude then you know all you got to do is rack up
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:26.640]  enough minutes of that and you've met your annual allowance as a member of
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:30.640]  society not a radiation worker and they're dosing you with those scanners
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:34.640]  every time to get on and off the plane now getting off the plane is ridiculous
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:39.640]  but to get on and at the end of the day it's just like they're just juicing
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:43.640]  you up the radiation and anybody who studied radiation or works in a radiation
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:48.640]  field knows the rule is as low as reasonably achievable and they haven't
[02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:51.640]  caught any terrorists in the last nine years and these x-ray scanners aren't
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:55.640]  gonna help anymore either listen we're out of time you ought to make a YouTube
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:57:59.640]  video damn and you're very articulate you've got the facts we need radiologists
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:03.640]  and people that work in radiology to all make YouTube videos to write articles
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:07.640]  it'll be up on the drudge report in other places when the people start being
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:11.640]  heard there's nothing the globalist can do to stop us whether it's on the banking
[02:58:11.640 --> 02:58:17.640]  cover or all these wars they're cooking up or this power grab of the farms the
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:23.640]  ranches the internet the wanting to cut the veterans health care stealing their
[02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:27.640]  pensions I mean it's all happening and I'm I'm sorry to Joe and Ronnie and
