[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]  Now I'm calling in this hour. What's what's up, man? What do you got? I just got a call
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.120]  I was about to lay down and take a nap because I'm running a fever today. It's got a cold
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.080]  I gotta go do a TV show tonight. I was about to try to take a nap and the phone kept ringing and it was Jeff Dice
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.520]  The head staffer for Ron Paul. Mm-hmm
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.040]  And I mean he was upset. I've never heard I've known the guy for years
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.880]  He was Alex these these pieces of filth that voted for Bush
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.720]  They don't understand the Republicans are doing whatever Bush tells him because he wants it
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.760]  This national ID card the new version they've introduced has even worse internal checkpoints are to be set up on the highways and
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760]  I wrote notes here domestic
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.600]  travel restrictions no other word, but tyranny and
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.680]  He says that it's about to pass the house tonight. It's going right to the Senate
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.760]  We've heard there's quote been this compromise, but but they've just rewritten it. We have the subsection with a national ID card
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.300]  We can't stop Patriot Act two now, that's in it
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.600]  So I hope that your show hope John Stadler show up all the shows. It's mine ended. He just he just called me
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.440]  Yeah, we'll get this out and everybody call your congressman now. Tell him how dare you we don't want this
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.160]  This is incredible, but the limiter Ron Paul's office was upset. I mean, they're calling me up
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.220]  And they they sounded panic. They really do care. Yeah, I mean look I hate to say it Alex
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.980]  I don't want to be a pessimist, but this has been kind of a foregone conclusion
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.180]  I saw the writing on the wall on this a couple of weeks ago
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.220]  They were threatening people to get this done that they were they using the of course
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.020]  Terminology that we will be attacked by terrorists if we don't pass this right now. Yeah, but the border stays wide open
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.460]  You call folks you need to call Congress
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.100]  Call your Congress, but right now call their local and other offices. They were in a campaign against you you traitors
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.620]  The bill is s 2845 or intelligence reform s
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.980]  2845 the subsection with a national ID card internal checkpoints and having to have this to have a job
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.580]  He is seven two one two
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.320]  And he said when you call they'll deny it even exist. Of course
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:16.100]  Seven two one two and I'm getting calls from Ron Paul's office now when his head staff were freaking out over this
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.100]  I mean angry. Yeah, I know Jeff. He's a pretty reasonable guy
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.940]  So if he's upset, this is obviously something that they're they're not too happy about. Well, thank God
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.780]  We got Ron Paul out there ringing in the Bell
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.820]  I wish normally you're supposed to get upset about this type of stuff
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820]  I don't know the guy for like five years
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.580]  And I'm not Ron Paul I'm not Ron Paul for longer than that, but I've known Jeff guys
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.860]  And he's always mild mannered this guy was like, you know, just going well, I'm not gonna say he's very obscene
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.020]  So we got to stop this we we might be able to shoot this down
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.580]  Well, look we can call in and we could say not only are we not you're not gonna get our vote
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.340]  But we're gonna campaign against you if you assist in pulling this legislation through. Yeah
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.780]  Well, you know, I called in again
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.580]  I've got congressman's aides calling up asked begging me to do something and I've been them begging you folks
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.020]  Call them and just say you Larson as traitors
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.740]  You want to give total amnesty and accept all these foreign IDs, but you want us to have these and domestic
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.180]  Checkpoints, it's s 2845 in the house of all things
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.040]  And then it's seven two one two is the subsection
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.420]  7212 you call when you tell them you get those federal mandates for standardized driver's license out of there
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.500]  And you do it now you I mean, it's just this is the wiping of our country everybody
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.740]  I don't have a number in front of me, but just call call information call Congress
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.380]  Call call call and I'm hoping that the next show and all the other broadcasts everybody else will call other shows
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.580]  Or we at least have to try we morally have to fight this that's exactly right. Well Alex. Thanks for that announcement
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.180]  I appreciate it in you folks. Thank you. Here's something everybody always says well
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.500]  What can we do when I know people like to complain that calling our congressman does nothing
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.980]  But if enough of us call right now all at the same time and say exactly this look we're not standing for this
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.860]  You're not getting our vote. We're gonna get out and campaign against you for this and we know what you're up to
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.700]  We're not gonna stand for it and you better get that through your head
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.900]  I think it'll have an impact I do I mean I have to believe that let's go to John
