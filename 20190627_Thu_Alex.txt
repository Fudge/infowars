[00:00.000 --> 00:07.080]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:07.080 --> 00:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:10.200 --> 00:18.600]  Well, I've got to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the first night of the 2019 democratic national
[00:18.600 --> 00:22.480]  debate did not disappoint.
[00:22.480 --> 00:27.280]  No clown world is a real place, and we're just living in it, and when you look at the
[00:27.280 --> 00:33.720]  clowns that were on stage last night, it was so pathetic, so boring, so ridiculous that
[00:33.720 --> 00:38.560]  it was enthralling as we sat there covering it live.
[00:38.560 --> 00:45.400]  The microphone problems, the technical difficulties, the one-upsmanship with Cory Booker talking
[00:45.400 --> 00:52.640]  about the epidemic of blacks being lynched, and how that black trans people are being
[00:52.640 --> 00:59.760]  beat up, and just all of this made up fables that it went on and on, and then, oh, we're
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.200]  going to have gun confiscation, but it's not gun confiscation because we're going to pay
[01:04.200 --> 01:06.360]  you for them.
[01:06.360 --> 01:11.800]  And then Elizabeth Warren looked like she'd snorted 14 lines of methamphetamine and was
[01:11.800 --> 01:13.760]  like some evil witch.
[01:13.760 --> 01:24.560]  All of them except the congresswoman from Hawaii looked like they had escaped a mental asylum.
[01:24.560 --> 01:30.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, then you add to this the fact that we had reporters outside, and
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.600]  there might have been 50 people total that came out for the democratic debates that were
[01:35.600 --> 01:39.120]  Democrats and several hundred that were there for Trump.
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.520]  So this is a huge opportunity.
[01:43.520 --> 01:50.760]  Everyone listening who is in Florida needs to go out there because there was no energy,
[01:50.760 --> 01:56.440]  there was no nothing, and you can totally dominate the national headlines even bigger
[01:56.440 --> 02:02.520]  than we just saw by having Trump supporters with all their energy and all their stamina
[02:02.520 --> 02:08.800]  and all their quick wit and all their great looks, in most cases, coming out and juxtaposing
[02:08.800 --> 02:17.200]  the low energy Democrats, who I'm sorry, all look like they were auditioning for the return
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.160]  of Saturday Night Live's character, Pat.
[02:20.160 --> 02:27.000]  Now today, I promise to take my daughter's fishing, yes, before they go to camp.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.840]  So I'm going to be out today, but I'll be back tonight with live coverage in studio
[02:31.840 --> 02:37.320]  with Robert Barnes, Owen Schreuer, and others, and the rest of our amazing crew, Millie Weaver,
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.160]  Savannah Hernandez, and others on the streets there in Miami.
[02:42.160 --> 02:46.480]  For the second night, which should have more energy, it's kind of got the bigger headliners,
[02:46.480 --> 02:52.480]  Joe Biden, and of course, white people do not know what it is like to be poor, Bernie
[02:52.480 --> 02:54.040]  Sanders.
[02:54.040 --> 02:56.120]  Never saw a college, he didn't want to swindle.
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.000]  So this is going to be a big transmission today and tonight, but here's the bottom line.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.920]  I love to say bottom line, it's true.
[03:03.920 --> 03:08.080]  This was emblematic, the technical difficulties, the fact that they all look like they'd escaped
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.520]  a mental institute, a low-tech asylum.
[03:12.520 --> 03:18.960]  All of this together, no one outside to support them, all of it together shows how pathetic
[03:18.960 --> 03:23.240]  these clowns are and that they've been in their own bubbles.
[03:23.240 --> 03:28.560]  They've been in their own echo chambers so long that they really don't get that America's
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.920]  sick of being bullied and sick of being told we're racist and sick of being told how much
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.160]  we suck and sick of being told we put kids in cages when they're battling to get into
[03:37.160 --> 03:40.200]  the United States and it was Obama put them in the cages.
[03:40.200 --> 03:45.840]  We see through them and this shows the hoax more than ever has dissipated.
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.200]  Now when we come back, Robert Barnes is going to take over and I'm going to recap what I
[03:51.200 --> 03:57.840]  just said with two other huge points that I've not hit yet.
[03:57.840 --> 04:01.880]  So again, this is not a spectator sport.
[04:01.880 --> 04:08.240]  This is a participation blood sport politically for the future of not just America but the
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.240]  world.
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.680]  Humanity has been asleep, humanity is awakening, the globalists are freaking out trying to
[04:13.680 --> 04:17.040]  put us back in the trance but it's not working.
[04:17.040 --> 04:25.160]  It's the second day of the greatest comedy show on earth, Clown World 2019 with live
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.840]  info wars dot com and news wars dot com coverage we shall return on the other side from the
[04:31.840 --> 04:38.400]  info wars news center in Austin, Texas, whatever you do, spread the word and tell the world
[04:38.400 --> 04:49.560]  that Clown World is here but humanity is invading defending the republic from enemies, foreign
[04:49.560 --> 05:00.920]  and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[05:00.920 --> 05:04.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.200]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[05:09.200 --> 05:13.160]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by
[05:13.160 --> 05:16.680]  some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[05:16.680 --> 05:18.400]  It is completely independent of all that.
[05:18.400 --> 05:24.120]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[05:24.120 --> 05:28.000]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.360]  the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.880]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era
[05:35.880 --> 05:39.760]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[05:39.760 --> 05:43.840]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.920]  have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that.
[05:47.920 --> 05:52.720]  The they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[05:52.720 --> 05:53.720]  and freedom.
[05:53.720 --> 05:57.600]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[05:57.600 --> 06:27.560]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[06:27.560 --> 06:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, last night was spectacular.
[06:32.840 --> 06:40.160]  The Democrats over delivered with exactly what we thought we were going to get funnier
[06:40.160 --> 06:45.080]  than 20 clowns trying to get into one Volkswagen.
[06:45.080 --> 06:47.520]  We saw 10 clowns up on stage.
[06:47.520 --> 06:54.920]  It was emblematic of how the left ruins every city, every state, every nation they get.
[06:54.920 --> 07:00.040]  They were all competing with each other to hate on America and to try to manipulate the
[07:00.040 --> 07:03.320]  heartstrings of the American people.
[07:03.320 --> 07:08.080]  This was true victim culture where you give up any Americana culture, you give up any
[07:08.080 --> 07:15.800]  free market culture, you give up right individualism and you embrace that you are a victim and
[07:15.800 --> 07:22.520]  then you wallow in the victimhood and these were the high priest up there on the stage.
[07:22.520 --> 07:29.440]  Obviously, the big emblematic takeaway is that the left ruins every area of life and
[07:29.440 --> 07:38.960]  culture from business to government, to academia, to faith, to basic hygiene, everywhere they're
[07:38.960 --> 07:46.640]  in control, massive disease, mental illness, low IQs, human feces everywhere.
[07:46.640 --> 07:47.960]  I mean it's really not a joke.
[07:47.960 --> 07:53.200]  These people wreck everything they touch and they suck everything dry because they come
[07:53.200 --> 07:55.640]  out of the French Revolution.
[07:55.640 --> 08:00.960]  The first time we hear about leftist and the left-hand path of being a political movement
[08:00.960 --> 08:02.960]  is the Jacobins and the French Revolution.
[08:02.960 --> 08:06.960]  They were literal nihilists slash devil worshipers.
[08:06.960 --> 08:12.760]  Yes, they believed in nothing but being the devil incarnate with total power.
[08:12.760 --> 08:16.680]  They wanted nine-day work weeks, they wanted to change the calendar, they wanted to end
[08:16.680 --> 08:22.440]  the family, they wanted to end the genders and they had what they called the bloody red
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.440]  terror.
[08:23.440 --> 08:31.600]  Yes, Lenin didn't invent that and they overthrew society, not just existing orders, but everything
[08:31.600 --> 08:32.600]  in society.
[08:32.600 --> 08:35.040]  That was their goal until they burned themselves out.
[08:35.040 --> 08:42.040]  And so that's the big takeaway here is the technical difficulties, the mics not working,
[08:42.040 --> 08:47.800]  having to go to break repeatedly, having the lights not tuned right.
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.480]  All of this was emblematic of the breakdown of civilization and culture.
[08:53.480 --> 08:59.120]  You can imagine the political correctness going on at MSNBC and NBC that's already paralyzed
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.200]  that company.
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.880]  You hear about all the lawsuits and all the racism and sexism fights that go on at CNN
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.800]  and ABC, they're all collapsing in their own echo chambers, their own little clown world,
[09:12.800 --> 09:14.400]  their own little bubble.
[09:14.400 --> 09:19.760]  And as it collapses, like a star collapsing and forming a black hole, they're all intensifying
[09:19.760 --> 09:27.600]  their radicalism, hoping within that compacted system they can rule the hell they've created.
[09:27.600 --> 09:32.840]  Because it was once said, it's better to reign in hell than serve in the republic and be
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  free.
[09:33.840 --> 09:41.360]  But the big takeaways, think about this, not just the fact that many of the participants
[09:41.360 --> 09:47.360]  look like they had escaped from a lunatic asylum, and again, that obviously Elizabeth
[09:47.360 --> 09:52.260]  Warren, who's normally low energy, looked like she was ready to murder someone and had
[09:52.260 --> 10:00.400]  lightning bolts coming out of her eyes for two hours, guaranteed was on serious amphetamines.
[10:00.400 --> 10:02.840]  Probably large amounts of it.
[10:02.840 --> 10:08.880]  And then again, everyone else clownishly trying to look sad and upset and running the nation
[10:08.880 --> 10:10.760]  down, trying to demoralize us.
[10:10.760 --> 10:12.280]  But that's not the biggest issue.
[10:12.280 --> 10:18.400]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's not just the tiny crowd of maybe 50 people paid for by
[10:18.400 --> 10:21.360]  George Soros and others pushing carbon taxes.
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.360]  No.
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.560]  Or the fact that there were more Trump supporters outside, probably five to one.
[10:26.560 --> 10:33.640]  The big story is that Google and Facebook and Twitter and Reddit all for the last week
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.520]  have intensified censorship and have locked down the Donald subreddit and other systems
[10:39.520 --> 10:45.200]  where no one could even communicate during this because no one was supposed to be able
[10:45.200 --> 10:48.360]  to ruin this magic moment.
[10:48.360 --> 10:51.480]  You know that song, this magic moment.
[10:51.480 --> 10:54.720]  Oh, it's so beautiful, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:54.720 --> 10:56.200]  It's so cute.
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.520]  It's so wonderful.
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.480]  But you see, they couldn't stop the fact that everyone would reject it, even if they brought
[11:02.480 --> 11:11.920]  it an iron curtain, an iron mask, an iron steel trap to purge and have a scourge of
[11:11.920 --> 11:16.200]  free speech in the hopes of propping up this facade.
[11:16.200 --> 11:20.520]  It's still a facade, even if you try to prop it up.
[11:20.520 --> 11:23.600]  And so people rejected it in mass.
[11:23.600 --> 11:29.760]  And that's the big takeaway, that all the censorship and all the control and all the
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.240]  manipulation and all the pre-hype and our crews were there.
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.320]  The place was like a ghost town.
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.600]  The people coming out looked completely low energy, didn't want to talk to any of the
[11:41.600 --> 11:42.600]  media.
[11:42.600 --> 11:44.880]  They looked like they'd all just come out of a really bad movie.
[11:44.880 --> 11:50.080]  There were people falling asleep and surfing their phones and yawning in the front rows
[11:50.080 --> 11:52.600]  and it just got better and better and better.
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.880]  You know those movies that are so bad, they're good, they even have awards for the worst
[11:56.880 --> 12:00.440]  movies and you watch those movies, they're hilarious.
[12:00.440 --> 12:03.680]  Some of these Yohara movies that are low budget, this was the same thing.
[12:03.680 --> 12:10.080]  I was just entranced by this circus crew, but they are the ruling class.
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.200]  They are still currently in power and they're trying to cling on to power.
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.960]  Look at Trump with all his energy, all his focus and how much he's gotten done.
[12:18.960 --> 12:20.280]  Look at what Info Wars has done.
[12:20.280 --> 12:21.960]  Look at what you've done.
[12:21.960 --> 12:22.960]  Be American.
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.600]  No matter what color you are, if you love freedom and you love justice, then you are
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.440]  part of the winning team and you're not part of Clown World, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:32.440 --> 12:34.640]  There's a lot of other angles to this.
[12:34.640 --> 12:38.440]  Obviously, we're going to be playing clips today, going over it, we're going to be covering
[12:38.440 --> 12:39.440]  it live tonight.
[12:39.440 --> 12:43.280]  Robert Barnes is going to be hosting, I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock central for Clown
[12:43.280 --> 12:44.280]  World.
[12:44.280 --> 12:48.280]  Thank you all for your support, but I got to tell you, this is the rotting edifice of
[12:48.280 --> 12:49.480]  the establishment.
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.960]  They are delusional and I'm more sure than ever we're going to win, but it's going to
[12:53.960 --> 12:59.000]  be an incredible fight because these people are disconnected from reality.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.840]  Again, there's a lot of other angles here, but the big ones are the almost no attendance
[13:05.840 --> 13:12.640]  outside, the low energy, the technical difficulties, the fact that they were all fighting with
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.120]  each other just shows what a ship of fools this is, but remember, despite all the system
[13:18.120 --> 13:24.360]  trying to prop it up, it collapsed like everything else they do, but if they're able to steal
[13:24.360 --> 13:29.640]  the election with Google meddling, we'll never know that we really won because they will
[13:29.640 --> 13:34.760]  steal it and tell us that we're losers just like they stole the house in last year's election.
[13:34.760 --> 13:41.320]  So Trump must act because they will try to force us to keep living in Clown World by
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.560]  election fraud just like they do in Venezuela and other authoritarian regimes.
[13:45.560 --> 13:49.360]  Robert Barnes is taking over, please don't forget, this broadcast is listener supported,
[13:49.360 --> 13:52.840]  we make it easy with great products, we're going to have to end the special coming up
[13:52.840 --> 13:59.040]  on July 4th, so the July 4th special is about to end, it's the Save Info War special, Extended
[13:59.040 --> 14:04.040]  Store Ride Free shipping, 50% off, double Patriot points, and we have the limited edition
[14:04.040 --> 14:14.440]  Clown World shirt that is the style of a rock and roll shirt or a arena shirt, a concert
[14:14.440 --> 14:21.520]  shirt where it basically commemorates and celebrates this ridiculous Clown World event.
[14:21.520 --> 14:28.800]  We've already sold half of the 5,000, it's limited edition, get yours at infowarstore.com
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.240]  or infowarslife.com or by calling toll free, triple 82533139.
[14:33.240 --> 14:37.440]  Now for the balance of the broadcast, Robert Barnes will be analyzing this, Attorney-in-Law
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.080]  and Info Wars Council, please stay with us and spread the word, that's how we override
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.560]  the clowns that think they're in control, but not much longer.
[14:46.560 --> 14:50.160]  Happy to be here, summing in for Alex Jones this afternoon, who will be back tonight to
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.840]  cover the second stage of the Democratic debates, Clown World Part 2, the sequel, we'll see
[14:55.840 --> 14:59.440]  if it's as good as comedic as the first one was.
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.360]  We'll also be discussing major decisions today by the Supreme Court of the United States.
[15:04.360 --> 15:10.520]  Can the Commerce Department simply ask a citizenship question on the U.S. Census?
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.640]  Can legislators or judges decide how districting is done across the country?
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.120]  Can Democrats go to judges and have them rewrite political districts that were chosen in a
[15:20.120 --> 15:23.360]  different way by the elected officials?
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.120]  Why has the Supreme Court that was appointed by mostly pro-life conservative jurists continually
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.120]  abandoned them at key decisions about government authority?
[15:31.120 --> 15:34.280]  We'll talk about the surprise winner of the Democratic debates last night.
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.680]  The Democratic scandals covered up both last night and may be covered up again tonight.
[15:38.680 --> 15:41.240]  We'll talk about what questions should be asked.
[15:41.240 --> 15:44.800]  The Democratic candidates for the debates tonight, and what questions should be asked
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.640]  Robert Mueller, who's the guest who just won't go away.
[15:47.640 --> 15:52.320]  And Lenny Dijkstra's cold coffee roll that's needed for Robert Mueller for Republican questioning
[15:52.320 --> 16:00.000]  in his upcoming congressional appearance.
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.800]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you
[16:05.800 --> 16:11.240]  now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.800]  Because now, Sunny Bay heating wraps and pillows are available at both Amazon and Walmart.

[17:29.160 --> 17:30.160]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.880]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:33.880 --> 17:35.440]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:35.440 --> 17:38.400]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:38.400 --> 17:41.680]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[18:00.440 --> 18:01.440]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.440 --> 18:02.440]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[18:02.440 --> 18:03.440]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.440 --> 18:04.440]  Hey, Alex.
[18:04.440 --> 18:06.280]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.280 --> 18:09.920]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is
[18:09.920 --> 18:12.400]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.800]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.800 --> 18:21.080]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching
[18:21.080 --> 18:22.080]  2020.
[18:22.080 --> 18:23.080]  That's it.
[18:23.080 --> 18:25.080]  It's the eyes end of this.
[18:25.080 --> 18:26.080]  It'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:26.080 --> 18:27.960]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:27.960 --> 18:29.240]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.240 --> 18:30.240]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.240 --> 18:33.480]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.480 --> 18:35.400]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.400 --> 18:38.400]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.400 --> 18:40.640]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.640 --> 18:43.840]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.440]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.440 --> 18:49.440]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.280]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or
[18:53.280 --> 18:58.160]  your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.

[20:03.480 --> 20:21.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.880 --> 20:30.800]  Hey, guest hosting today on the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.800 --> 20:33.560]  This is Attorney Robert Barnes stepping in for Alex.
[20:33.560 --> 20:39.520]  We'll be back tonight for Clown World Part II with Owen Schreuer to discuss the second
[20:39.520 --> 20:42.720]  stage of the Democratic debates when the big candidates will be up there.
[20:42.720 --> 20:47.160]  We'll be discussing why is the media going after the Drudge Report for its poll survey
[20:47.160 --> 20:50.960]  on who the surprise winner was of last night's Democratic debate.
[20:50.960 --> 20:55.480]  What scandal questions did the media refuse to ask last night's debate candidates?
[20:55.480 --> 20:57.120]  And will they ask Joe Biden?
[20:57.120 --> 20:58.720]  Will they ask Bernie Sanders?
[20:58.720 --> 21:00.360]  Will they ask Kamala Harris?
[21:00.360 --> 21:02.400]  Will they ask Pete Buttigieg?
[21:02.400 --> 21:07.440]  Those same questions that they refused to ask last night about scandals in these candidates
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.440]  past.
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.480]  But first, with the Supreme Court.
[21:10.480 --> 21:13.680]  The Supreme Court today issued two seminal decisions.
[21:13.680 --> 21:17.560]  One on the question about whether or not the President Trump can ask about whether someone
[21:17.560 --> 21:21.800]  is a citizen for our own census of our own citizens.
[21:21.800 --> 21:27.120]  And the second question is whether or not the who gets to control how candidates are
[21:27.120 --> 21:29.360]  picked and how districts are drawn?
[21:29.360 --> 21:33.360]  Do the people that are elected get to pick that, the legislators and governors?
[21:33.360 --> 21:36.120]  Or do the liberal courts get to pick that?
[21:36.120 --> 21:37.320]  First the good news.
[21:37.320 --> 21:42.880]  In the redistricting decision, the courts finally, the Supreme Court finally put an end to the
[21:42.880 --> 21:47.680]  judges rewriting districts in favor of Democratic candidates and Democratic politicians who
[21:47.680 --> 21:49.400]  fail to win elections.
[21:49.400 --> 21:53.880]  As they made clear today, redistricting is something that a party does not have standing
[21:53.880 --> 21:54.880]  to bring.
[21:54.880 --> 21:59.520]  It is a political question that belongs to the legislators and to the governor, not to
[21:59.520 --> 22:03.000]  unelected politicians and unelected federal judges.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.960]  The doctrine of standing is sort of like a way to think of it is if in order to be able
[22:06.960 --> 22:10.120]  to speak at a town hall, you need to stand to speak.
[22:10.120 --> 22:14.680]  So standing is whether or not you have a legal right, a legal entitlement, a legal opportunity
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.920]  to be able to present an argument in court.
[22:16.920 --> 22:19.800]  In this context, the question is who decides?
[22:19.800 --> 22:21.100]  Who has the power?
[22:21.100 --> 22:23.720]  Who gets to write and draw the districts?
[22:23.720 --> 22:27.280]  Do the elected officials do that people have chosen to do so?
[22:27.280 --> 22:29.280]  Or do the courts get to do so?
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.200]  And so this was a critical decision where the Supreme Court finally put an end to judges
[22:33.200 --> 22:37.960]  rewriting districts, overturning legislators, overturning the elected officials the public
[22:37.960 --> 22:39.600]  chose to write these districts.
[22:39.600 --> 22:43.920]  So that's a big win, a big win for conservatives, a big win for constitutionalists, a big win
[22:43.920 --> 22:47.440]  for civil libertarians, a big win for little D Democrats.
[22:47.440 --> 22:50.000]  Now we get to the second decision on the census.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.240]  The census decision is not quite how the media will portray it, though it is not the win
[22:54.240 --> 22:55.840]  that Trump deserved.
[22:55.840 --> 23:01.680]  The media will portray this as a complete victory by the people attacking the president
[23:01.680 --> 23:06.200]  because the Supreme Court did not affirmatively state that the Commerce Department could
[23:06.200 --> 23:11.560]  simply ask whether or not you're a citizen on a census form that's about doing a census
[23:11.560 --> 23:13.160]  of U.S. citizens.
[23:13.160 --> 23:17.520]  So despite the sort of ludicrous and absurd nature of a Supreme Court saying that question
[23:17.520 --> 23:23.160]  cannot be asked by the elected executive branch of government, there was a caveat to
[23:23.160 --> 23:24.680]  the court's decision.
[23:24.680 --> 23:31.360]  The court also said that the Commerce Department could actually include the citizenship question
[23:31.360 --> 23:34.760]  if they came back with a better rationale and justification.
[23:34.760 --> 23:39.760]  Now this is the Supreme Court overseeing the executive branch in a way that the Constitution
[23:39.760 --> 23:45.080]  does not call for and that is anti-democratic in its form because it has the court reexamining
[23:45.080 --> 23:49.760]  the motives and intent and ideas behind these policies.
[23:49.760 --> 23:54.760]  And it will come as no surprise, the justice who was key to this was Chief Justice Roberts.
[23:54.760 --> 23:59.280]  It was the four democratic justices, democratically appointed justices, and Justice Roberts just
[23:59.280 --> 24:01.000]  like it was in Obamacare.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.960]  Now notably, Obama went out, in the Obamacare case, Justice Roberts went out of his way
[24:04.960 --> 24:11.040]  to completely ignore what Barack Obama had said that the mandate was a mandate and instead
[24:11.040 --> 24:16.480]  pretended it was a tax and because it was a tax, it magically became constitutional.
[24:16.480 --> 24:20.000]  That of course didn't really make any sense by people who had reviewed the actual public
[24:20.000 --> 24:21.640]  or political record.
[24:21.640 --> 24:25.880]  Yet here he goes out of his way to suddenly say motive is all that matters and that all
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.160]  that matters is whether or not the Commerce Department and the Commerce Secretary Wilbur
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.640]  Ross, what was their real goal and objective in asking a very simple basic, elementary question
[24:35.640 --> 24:41.320]  that has been on every census in the census history, which is, are you a citizen or not?
[24:41.320 --> 24:44.600]  And instead said, well, we're going to second guess that, we're going to doubt that, we're
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.260]  going to challenge that, we're going to say for some reason we can no longer take him
[24:48.260 --> 24:53.080]  at his word, even though in the case of Obamacare, Justice Roberts, again the key decision maker,
[24:53.080 --> 24:56.560]  went out of his way to make up words that didn't even exist and motives that didn't
[24:56.560 --> 24:57.800]  even exist.
[24:57.800 --> 25:01.720]  So this gets us to a broader question about the Supreme Court in general.
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.240]  Here we have had for the majority of the time since the 1990s, a majority of Supreme Court
[25:06.240 --> 25:10.640]  justices appointed by presidents who promised that they would appoint justices that would
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.680]  affirm constitutional principles, affirm certain conservative principles, and affirm pro-life
[25:15.680 --> 25:17.400]  principles in particular.
[25:17.400 --> 25:21.640]  And yet on the issue of abortion, the Supreme Court has hardly budged or moved from the
[25:21.640 --> 25:24.080]  liberal consensus that came in before it.
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.680]  If anything, they've become even more ideological in their support of it.
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.080]  And here again, you see Justice Roberts taking the Anthony Kennedy role that was previously
[25:32.080 --> 25:37.920]  played by Sarah Day O'Connor, which is basically trying to appeal to the cocktail circuit,
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.880]  trying to appeal to the media and get their approval, trying to make sure that he is welcome
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.960]  at all the cocktail parties in D.C. and New York.
[25:46.960 --> 25:49.320]  Justice Kennedy played that role for many years.
[25:49.320 --> 25:51.560]  Justice O'Connor played that role before him.
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.600]  And here you have another justice abandoning the principles that got him there, abandoning
[25:56.600 --> 26:00.480]  the conservative principles that helped him get nominated in the first instance in order
[26:00.480 --> 26:06.620]  to seek the approval of the rentier class, the media class, the legal left class, instead
[26:06.620 --> 26:11.040]  of seeking the approval of the law and seeking the approval of those who put him in the position
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.760]  of power in the first place.
[26:12.760 --> 26:19.760]  This is why the sort of never-Trump world will never appoint justices or recommend justices
[26:19.760 --> 26:25.160]  that will in any way support or continue to substantiate true conservatism.
[26:25.160 --> 26:29.880]  It is evident that both of Trump's appointees both recognize that obviously the citizenship
[26:29.880 --> 26:35.200]  question should be included for a census of U.S. citizens, and that it would be insane
[26:35.200 --> 26:37.000]  and absurd to do anything different.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.520]  So the president had a partial setback, but it wasn't quite a complete setback, as even
[26:40.520 --> 26:44.780]  Chief Justice Roberts couldn't completely prostitute his principles just to seek the
[26:44.780 --> 26:48.060]  momentary approval of the folks in the Hamptons for the summer.
[26:48.060 --> 26:54.040]  So while he obtained part of that approval, what he did was allow the census to include
[26:54.040 --> 26:59.560]  a citizenship question if they simply go back and change their motivation and rationale
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.760]  and come up with a more compelling and convincing one, which I'm quite sure they will.
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.400]  So I think ultimately this is a momentary setback, not a long-term setback.
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.520]  The win in the Supreme Court on redistricting is far more significant and consequential
[27:12.520 --> 27:14.920]  than the loss on the census question.
[27:14.920 --> 27:18.160]  But that wraps up the entire Supreme Court term.
[27:18.160 --> 27:20.160]  The Supreme Court is now off for the summer.
[27:20.160 --> 27:21.320]  They take extended breaks.
[27:21.320 --> 27:24.760]  They continue to take only a small number of cases, which other people question and
[27:24.760 --> 27:30.560]  challenge, often 60 to 80 cases a year, and that's the same number they were taking back
[27:30.560 --> 27:31.760]  in the 70s.
[27:31.760 --> 27:35.720]  So some have reasonably and fairly and correctly questioned whether that's enough, but that's
[27:35.720 --> 27:36.720]  what they're doing.
[27:36.720 --> 27:39.360]  And they sort of skipped out and dodged on a lot of political questions.
[27:39.360 --> 27:44.000]  The fact that the census question only was decided on literally the very last day they
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.640]  could issue a decision suggests that Justice Roberts went back and forth.
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.120]  Do I appease the Hamptons crowd, do I appease the New York Times crowd, do I appease the
[27:52.120 --> 27:57.400]  Harvard Law School crowd, or do I appease the people who put me in power?
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.600]  Do I uphold the principles that I had promised to uphold in getting nominated to this position
[28:01.600 --> 28:02.920]  in the first place?
[28:02.920 --> 28:07.200]  Do I simply follow what the Constitutional Law history precedent and common sense say
[28:07.200 --> 28:08.200]  to follow?
[28:08.200 --> 28:13.560]  Unfortunately, what he chose was he sort of split the baby that was requested of Solomon,
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.320]  and in the process, ultimately will likely give Trump an ultimate victory by being able
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.640]  to include the citizenship question in the census, but put that in doubt momentarily
[28:22.640 --> 28:27.200]  by the way in which he framed it and by second guessing the Commerce Secretary's decision.
[28:27.200 --> 28:31.000]  When we come back, we should look at who is the surprise winner of the Democratic debates
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.360]  and what they have in common with President Trump.
[28:34.360 --> 28:37.680]  What we'll also look at is why is the media attacking the Drudge Report?
[28:37.680 --> 28:42.000]  Why does the media think you should never listen to polls from the Drudge Report?
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.720]  Why is the media unhappy with who the surprise winner was?
[28:44.720 --> 28:48.080]  And we'll also talk about the not so surprising loser.
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.200]  So come back to the Alex Jones Show, turning Robert Barnes stepping in today to discuss
[28:52.200 --> 28:59.200]  that and more.
[28:59.200 --> 29:03.800]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:03.800 --> 29:05.720]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:05.720 --> 29:07.440]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.880]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[29:12.880 --> 29:13.960]  my life.
[29:13.960 --> 29:19.220]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:19.220 --> 29:24.400]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.560]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:27.560 --> 29:32.240]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:32.240 --> 29:34.560]  and totally change your life.
[29:34.560 --> 29:39.800]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:39.800 --> 29:43.080]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[29:43.080 --> 29:44.080]  Get clean.
[29:44.080 --> 29:58.080]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[29:58.080 --> 30:03.200]  We'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[30:03.200 --> 30:07.200]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final
[30:07.200 --> 30:11.960]  bank accounts we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need to know
[30:11.960 --> 30:14.720]  that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[30:14.720 --> 30:15.720]  We need to end the year.
[30:15.720 --> 30:19.800]  We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage
[30:19.800 --> 30:21.400]  forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[30:21.400 --> 30:25.280]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[30:25.280 --> 30:27.080]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[30:27.080 --> 30:31.120]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just
[30:31.120 --> 30:32.120]  brings more people here.
[30:32.120 --> 30:35.440]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[30:35.440 --> 30:36.440]  I need gas.
[30:36.440 --> 30:38.400]  I need ammo politically now.
[30:38.400 --> 30:42.280]  But literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and
[30:42.280 --> 30:45.680]  if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[30:45.680 --> 30:47.120]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[30:47.120 --> 30:50.800]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks
[30:50.800 --> 30:54.040]  are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[30:54.040 --> 30:55.240]  You have my commitment.
[30:55.240 --> 30:59.000]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.960]  about this.
[31:00.960 --> 31:05.680]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[31:05.680 --> 31:12.120]  the last year or so, it's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[31:12.120 --> 31:18.120]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as
[31:18.120 --> 31:23.520]  the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking, I've begged for your support
[31:23.520 --> 31:25.040]  before and thanks for keeping us afloat.
[31:25.040 --> 31:29.120]  But this is the real SOS, if you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and
[31:29.120 --> 31:33.640]  keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[31:33.640 --> 31:34.640]  And so we've reached that point.
[31:34.640 --> 31:38.800]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their
[31:38.800 --> 31:43.240]  attacks, we've gone through so much because of your support, you have, you have been there.
[31:43.240 --> 31:47.200]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their
[31:47.200 --> 31:48.200]  full assault.
[31:48.200 --> 31:54.160]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now and info wars.com.
[31:54.160 --> 31:55.520]  It's your fight.
[31:55.520 --> 31:59.520]  Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[31:59.520 --> 32:05.200]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with
[32:05.200 --> 32:10.600]  the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[32:10.600 --> 32:17.840]  The false claim that you purposely send kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous
[32:17.840 --> 32:19.680]  as well as false.
[32:19.680 --> 32:24.400]  It's a smear, somebody sends you something that's encrypted, you don't even open it.
[32:24.400 --> 32:29.120]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on
[32:29.120 --> 32:30.120]  you.
[32:30.120 --> 32:31.120]  This is Kafka-esque.
[32:31.120 --> 32:32.120]  This is bizarre.
[32:32.120 --> 32:38.400]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[32:38.400 --> 32:43.400]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected
[32:43.400 --> 32:44.400]  and clarified.
[32:44.400 --> 32:48.120]  But I wonder where the big boys, where's the Wall Street Journal, where's Associated
[32:48.120 --> 32:52.520]  Press, when are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about
[32:52.520 --> 32:54.320]  you was inaccurate.
[32:54.320 --> 32:59.280]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your
[32:59.280 --> 33:03.440]  dollars.
[33:03.440 --> 33:22.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:22.720 --> 33:27.800]  Glad to be back as the guest host, Attorney Robert Barnes for the Alex Jones Show.
[33:27.800 --> 33:31.480]  So why is it, who was the surprise winner of the Democratic debate last night?
[33:31.480 --> 33:36.760]  Well, there was the main surprise winner and that was this guy, President Donald Trump
[33:36.760 --> 33:41.040]  was the real winner of the Democratic debate last night as people saw how weak the Democratic
[33:41.040 --> 33:45.480]  party is in terms of its nominees, how many of its candidates lack spine, how many of
[33:45.480 --> 33:50.200]  them lack style, how many of them lack simple persuasive skill on a debate stage.
[33:50.200 --> 33:54.320]  The sort of unanimous thing was that if you wanted a new substitute for insomnia, you
[33:54.320 --> 33:58.480]  didn't need to take various sleeping pills, but you could just have the Democratic debate
[33:58.480 --> 33:59.520]  on a loop.
[33:59.520 --> 34:03.480]  So this was the net effect of the Democratic debate in terms of it drawing attention.
[34:03.480 --> 34:08.160]  But the other surprise winner within the Democratic stage last night was someone who is not a
[34:08.160 --> 34:12.480]  big surprise for people who have been observing the political scene for some time and that
[34:12.480 --> 34:15.280]  was Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.
[34:15.280 --> 34:19.760]  So what's unique about Tulsi Gabbard, she shares President Trump's perspective more
[34:19.760 --> 34:25.040]  than anyone else on that stage on issues of foreign policy and war and conflict.
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.000]  In fact, that was the only person accused of being the most like Trump on stage last
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.600]  night was Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.
[34:31.600 --> 34:34.880]  But Gabbard is someone that the mainstream press and the establishment press has waged
[34:34.880 --> 34:40.400]  a complete war on to suppress her dissident voice on the war-mongering, war-loving Democratic
[34:40.400 --> 34:41.960]  party of today.
[34:41.960 --> 34:46.120]  So the consequently, they couldn't promote her and haven't been promoting her and two-thirds
[34:46.120 --> 34:51.240]  of the country were first introduced to her in her views last night, including most Democrats.
[34:51.240 --> 34:55.080]  And she was the number one person searched on what's called Google Trends.
[34:55.080 --> 34:58.440]  So you can go to Google and look up Google Trends and you can look at who the rest of
[34:58.440 --> 35:00.160]  the world is searching for.
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.760]  Two-thirds of the states had Tulsi Gabbard as the number one person they were searching
[35:03.760 --> 35:04.760]  for.
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.600]  There was a map that was done in the Zero Hedge article that's also up on Infowars,
[35:08.600 --> 35:12.440]  where it mentioned that ahead of the debate, Elizabeth Warren is the person that's being
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.360]  mostly researched, a little bit with Cory Booker and some with Beto O'Rourke.
[35:17.360 --> 35:21.400]  And Tulsi Gabbard didn't place first anywhere other than her home state of Hawaii.
[35:21.400 --> 35:27.600]  However, after the debate, it was all Tulsi Green that had covered the entire West Coast,
[35:27.600 --> 35:30.840]  almost the entire industrial Midwest, most of Appalachia.
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.560]  In fact, only states with a large African-American population saw Cory Booker top her.
[35:35.560 --> 35:38.960]  Otherwise, she was number one across the country in all of those searches.
[35:38.960 --> 35:40.120]  You see it all across that map.
[35:40.120 --> 35:45.840]  This is one, it looks like a Trump election map, just one big wave for one party.
[35:45.840 --> 35:49.960]  And you see in the Southeast, Indiana and Michigan, states that have substantial African-American
[35:49.960 --> 35:52.520]  populations on the Democratic primary side.
[35:52.520 --> 35:55.560]  That's where you see Cory Booker make some stay.
[35:55.560 --> 35:59.680]  Not surprisingly, Vermont is an anomalous state because that's where Bernie Sanders,
[35:59.680 --> 36:03.040]  of course, is from and he remains the most searched candidate there on a routine and
[36:03.040 --> 36:04.040]  regular basis.
[36:04.040 --> 36:07.640]  And New Jersey for Cory Booker because that's his home state.
[36:07.640 --> 36:11.160]  And only in the states that have a substantial where the African-American vote is the predominant
[36:11.160 --> 36:16.120]  vote in the Democratic primary in the Southeast, do you see where Cory Booker dominated.
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.320]  So the and basically, I think he brought up civil rights or in some way, shape, or form
[36:20.320 --> 36:22.440]  any time, any way he could.
[36:22.440 --> 36:26.320]  But what this showed was this is you had someone who was polling one to 2% of the polls who'd
[36:26.320 --> 36:28.280]  got almost no media coverage.
[36:28.280 --> 36:32.320]  And not surprisingly, the only candidate to be compared to Donald Trump last night was
[36:32.320 --> 36:33.520]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[36:33.520 --> 36:38.360]  The only candidate to challenge the establishment wars was Tulsi Gabbard.
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.720]  The only candidate to get an adverse question of any kind or of any caliber from anyone
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.280]  else on the press that night was Tulsi Gabbard.
[36:47.280 --> 36:51.160]  And it's not it's not at all surprise that she was also the candidate who's gotten the
[36:51.160 --> 36:55.640]  least positive press coverage coming into the debates and the least supported by big
[36:55.640 --> 36:57.200]  money and big finance.
[36:57.200 --> 37:01.440]  So it's not a surprise that when people saw the refreshing nature of someone being authentic,
[37:01.440 --> 37:05.800]  someone being independent, someone being Trump like within the Democratic Party and in sharing
[37:05.800 --> 37:10.720]  the viewpoints and the perspectives of Trump on foreign wars and foreign policies, Trump
[37:10.720 --> 37:16.200]  is probably the most war skeptical candidate to get elected to the presidency in our modern
[37:16.200 --> 37:21.400]  era has pulled us out of Libya, has made sure we didn't go further into other Middle East
[37:21.400 --> 37:26.560]  wars have not gone into Iran have not gone into Venezuela have not gone into Ukraine.
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.640]  Whereas if Hillary had been elected president, we probably would have been all over the place.
[37:29.640 --> 37:34.160]  And Gabbard also caused the only damage control that any candidate had to issue last night
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.540]  as she took out Congressman Tim Ryan.
[37:36.540 --> 37:41.360]  So Congressman Tim Ryan had she smacked him around a little bit because he didn't know
[37:41.360 --> 37:43.880]  who it was that attacked us on 9 11.
[37:43.880 --> 37:48.240]  So you had this sort of W Republicans who didn't know who attacked us on 9 11 thinking
[37:48.240 --> 37:49.800]  somehow it was Iraq.
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.680]  And last night you had Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan, who likes to talk about how he's
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.960]  a high school quarterback all the time, though better has lost that bet last night, whether
[37:57.960 --> 37:59.320]  he would bring it up again.
[37:59.320 --> 38:05.560]  But he actually blamed the Taliban in Afghanistan and the various leaders in Afghanistan not
[38:05.560 --> 38:08.000]  Al Qaeda for causing 9 11.
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.120]  So she immediately made clear that was not the case and pointed out and was one of the
[38:12.120 --> 38:17.600]  only candidates to challenge any foreign government's misuse and abuse of other American political
[38:17.600 --> 38:22.520]  process by noting Saudi Arabia's role in supporting Al Qaeda and supporting 9 11.
[38:22.520 --> 38:27.080]  So her willingness to voice dissident views against the Empire, the political establishment,
[38:27.080 --> 38:33.560]  the national security establishment that the media is in bed with is what lit a flame across
[38:33.560 --> 38:37.840]  the country amongst other Democrats who want that kind of honesty, integrity and independence
[38:37.840 --> 38:41.920]  in their nominee, which means she's probably going to get attacked left and right.
[38:41.920 --> 38:45.400]  That in turn left to a surprising set of attacks.
[38:45.400 --> 38:48.040]  And that was an attack on that Drudge.
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.760]  So Drudge reports simply put up a poll.
[38:49.760 --> 38:54.080]  They have millions of people who go to the Drudge report each day and they voted on who
[38:54.080 --> 38:56.600]  they thought won the Democratic debate.
[38:56.600 --> 39:01.440]  And Drudge report viewers, it was the biggest online poll, a far bigger poll than any polling
[39:01.440 --> 39:04.080]  that was going to be done by any media organization.
[39:04.080 --> 39:06.720]  And they came back and they said Tulsi Gabbard was the winner.
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.280]  They selected her as the overwhelming winner by three to one, four to one, five to one
[39:10.280 --> 39:12.500]  margins over any other candidate.
[39:12.500 --> 39:13.880]  So what does the media do?
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.080]  I guarantee you if the Drudge report had said Elizabeth Warren won the debate and there
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.320]  would have been a celebration of the Drudge report poll.
[39:20.320 --> 39:23.720]  But because it was the one candidate that they've been trying to suppress knowledge
[39:23.720 --> 39:28.760]  of, the one candidate they don't want people to know about, the one candidate who's dissident
[39:28.760 --> 39:34.920]  independent Trump-like views they want to suppress from the Democratic party, the media
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.280]  has waged war on the Drudge report, saying people shouldn't be looking at it, that it's
[39:39.280 --> 39:42.960]  a journalistic malpractice to even reference it.
[39:42.960 --> 39:46.800]  There's stories on the Hill, stories by the Washington Post reporters, stories by polling
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.280]  consultants and data consultants who are enraged because they think they alone should be the
[39:51.280 --> 39:56.160]  gatekeeper of news and information and public polling that no, you should never listen to
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.360]  the Drudge report or to Matt Drudge or to review the Drudge report because it simply reflects
[40:00.360 --> 40:02.680]  honest, accurate, independent information.
[40:02.680 --> 40:05.800]  That was also the large basis of Tulsi Gabbard's appeal last night.
[40:05.800 --> 40:07.400]  She comes across as authentic.
[40:07.400 --> 40:09.360]  She comes across as real.
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.320]  So even though her social and cultural positions are out of touch with many Americans and definitely
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.840]  many Republicans and conservatives, her foreign policy positions is what made her stand out.
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.640]  Of the five and a half minutes she got to speak last night, whereas they were giving
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.560]  10 minutes or more to people like Cory Booker, almost all of it was about agreeing with Trump's
[40:26.560 --> 40:29.240]  foreign policy in one way, shape, or form.
[40:29.240 --> 40:32.920]  And to the degree that she was even critical at all, her criticism was of people like
[40:32.920 --> 40:36.680]  John Bolton and some of the neocons that have tried to push Trump into wars that he has
[40:36.680 --> 40:39.000]  wisely, sagely pushed back on.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.760]  So it's not a surprise that she was really the winner.
[40:41.760 --> 40:47.160]  The question then is who is, as one article put it for reason, Tulsi Gabbard wrecks Dems
[40:47.160 --> 40:49.720]  with powerful anti-war debate answers.
[40:49.720 --> 40:53.480]  That's why she's sort of the Ron Paul of the Democratic Party.
[40:53.480 --> 40:57.120]  And for that same reason, they're going to suppress any knowledge or information about
[40:57.120 --> 40:58.120]  her.
[40:58.120 --> 40:59.120]  But that isn't the end of it.
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.120]  Who are the big losers?
[41:00.120 --> 41:04.720]  Well, there was B2O Rourke whose attempt to speak Spanish backfired and failed abysmally,
[41:04.720 --> 41:05.720]  but he wasn't the only loser.
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.600]  The first big loser was the media itself, not only because of its repeated technological
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.480]  failures last night, which we'll get to in the next segment, which led to a very popular
[41:14.480 --> 41:20.120]  meme that predictably the press will likely call a doctored video by Carpenter.
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.000]  But the other big loser was the ratings.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.760]  These candidates are so uninteresting, so boring, so bland.
[41:26.760 --> 41:33.520]  So as Trump himself, his only content-driven tweet last night about the Democratic debates
[41:33.520 --> 41:38.240]  was boring in all caps and exclamation points, and for good cause and good reason.
[41:38.240 --> 41:42.720]  It's because, aside from the famous, I mean, when the biggest thing that comes out for
[41:42.720 --> 41:47.520]  you out of a Democratic debate or any debate is people making memes and jokes about you,
[41:47.520 --> 41:49.320]  that means you're likely the loser.
[41:49.320 --> 41:50.520]  And that was B2O Rourke.
[41:50.520 --> 41:53.840]  He was the unanimously content loser.
[41:53.840 --> 41:56.280]  He was not only the subject of most of the memes.
[41:56.280 --> 42:01.480]  People talking about, as Cassandra Fairbanks noted, his peculiar lack of speaking Spanish
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.080]  and the way in which he tried to speak Spanish, like someone who just adds extra, you know,
[42:06.080 --> 42:09.440]  says a resto instead of, you know, takes an English word and then tries to add something
[42:09.440 --> 42:12.880]  to make, with a Spanish accent, tries to make it sound Spanish.
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.200]  But the other big losers were the TV networks themselves and the media.
[42:16.200 --> 42:19.760]  Not only for its technical failures and its complete inability to challenge and contest
[42:19.760 --> 42:25.080]  these Democratic candidates on their past scandals or just any kind of drama whatsoever,
[42:25.080 --> 42:27.040]  but their ratings were abysmal.
[42:27.040 --> 42:32.640]  So when Donald Trump appeared, Fox News, a cable news network, Fox News, attracted almost
[42:32.640 --> 42:38.320]  25 million people to watch Donald Trump in a debate that is still seminal and memorable
[42:38.320 --> 42:39.800]  to this day.
[42:39.800 --> 42:44.560]  With network news and three networks covering it, they couldn't even break 10 million people.
[42:44.560 --> 42:47.460]  So the Trump gets two and a half times the attention.
[42:47.460 --> 42:51.600]  So when we come back on the Alex Jones show, the me-guest hosting today, we'll discuss
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.600]  what Democratic scandals got covered up last night, what Democratic scandals might get
[42:55.600 --> 42:57.000]  covered up tonight.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.880]  Will they discuss Joe Biden in Ukraine?
[42:59.880 --> 43:04.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.640]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.560]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[43:13.560 --> 43:14.560]  one another.
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.200]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.960]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining,
[43:23.960 --> 43:28.200]  self-structured, little-de-Democratic structure that because the audience determines what
[43:28.200 --> 43:32.560]  content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices
[43:32.560 --> 43:33.840]  in supporting Infowars.
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.200]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.040]  a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate
[43:42.040 --> 43:47.240]  driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[43:47.240 --> 43:51.040]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want
[43:51.040 --> 43:52.040]  to hold.
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.200]  And it's the ultimate American Democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[43:56.200 --> 44:00.240]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[44:00.240 --> 44:06.160]  Living with Infowars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.760]  And luckily, our break room at the Infowars headquarters is stocked full of high quality
[44:11.760 --> 44:15.720]  Infowars store Patriot Blend coffee.

[44:32.320 --> 44:35.720]  There has never been a more important time to support Infowars.

[45:57.880 --> 45:58.880]  us today.
[45:58.880 --> 46:01.280]  These sales are big.
[46:01.280 --> 46:03.320]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[46:03.320 --> 46:06.400]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[46:06.400 --> 46:10.840]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[46:10.840 --> 46:11.840]  over two decades.
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.200]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[46:15.200 --> 46:18.520]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.800]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[46:22.800 --> 46:23.800]  to their course of conduct.
[46:23.800 --> 46:27.640]  Otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent
[46:27.640 --> 46:31.600]  to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy
[46:31.600 --> 46:35.000]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[46:35.000 --> 46:40.200]  The Infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[46:40.200 --> 46:44.920]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[46:44.920 --> 46:45.920]  free press.
[46:45.920 --> 46:50.360]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[46:50.360 --> 46:52.400]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[46:52.400 --> 46:55.320]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time, it's not happening.
[46:55.320 --> 46:57.120]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[46:57.120 --> 46:59.080]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[46:59.080 --> 47:03.040]  Even it is what you just saw.
[47:03.040 --> 47:22.560]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:22.560 --> 47:26.120]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[47:26.120 --> 47:27.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:27.120 --> 47:33.640]  The situation is unacceptable.
[47:33.640 --> 47:38.440]  It's the president who has attacked and demonized the immigrants.
[47:38.440 --> 47:39.440]  It's unacceptable.
[47:39.440 --> 47:41.440]  I'm going to change the rest.
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.560]  We need to include each person in our democracy.
[47:45.560 --> 47:53.040]  Each voter needs representation and we need to listen to each other.
[47:53.040 --> 48:01.480]  The situation is unacceptable, it's the president who has attacked and demonized the immigrants.
[48:01.480 --> 48:02.480]  It's unacceptable.
[48:02.480 --> 48:03.480]  I'm going to change the rest.
[48:03.480 --> 48:09.640]  What would you do in the first day if you were the president of this reality that is
[48:09.640 --> 48:10.640]  happening?
[48:10.640 --> 48:14.640]  What would you do, Congressman, day one at the White House?
[48:14.640 --> 48:22.160]  We are going to treat each person with respect and dignity that they deserve as humans.
[48:22.160 --> 48:27.160]  My name is Julian Castro and I am postulating for president of the United States.
[48:27.160 --> 48:29.360]  Let's switch to another topic now.
[48:29.360 --> 48:30.360]  We've got a lot to get through.
[48:30.360 --> 48:31.360]  Let's talk.
[48:31.360 --> 48:44.360]  My grandmother was actually separated from his family when he came in this time.
[48:44.360 --> 48:50.120]  The only thing they didn't have there is I am Faco, which is basically what that was.
[48:50.120 --> 48:54.840]  So at least Julian Castro, Diaz Velarte, they can do it because they are natively Spanish.
[48:54.840 --> 48:56.600]  They grew up in Spanish.
[48:56.600 --> 49:02.160]  But Beto's attempt to start off by doing Spanish led to the famous gift now, the famous meme
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.120]  of him with Congressman Booker and Elizabeth Warren both looking at him with strange eyes.
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.840]  You don't want to be the subject of a bad meme as your first debate.
[49:09.840 --> 49:16.440]  Beto's has sort of burned up quickly and part of it was that sort of fake Spanish routine.
[49:16.440 --> 49:17.440]  Same with Booker.
[49:17.440 --> 49:19.080]  Booker, that's just not a good Spanish routine.
[49:19.080 --> 49:22.840]  You can't really speak the language where you don't sound like you can speak the language
[49:22.840 --> 49:26.120]  because 90% of the audience is not going to be speaking Spanish.
[49:26.120 --> 49:27.240]  They had Telemundo.
[49:27.240 --> 49:29.080]  So the Telemundo was already translating things.
[49:29.080 --> 49:34.000]  So there was no real, it didn't provide anything but other than to say, look at me, I am Faco.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.120]  And that's what happened.
[49:35.120 --> 49:38.480]  And so the, and so it probably helped to crash Beto.
[49:38.480 --> 49:43.280]  But you go into other forms of sort of subtle bigotry that the Democrats engage in.
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.360]  You had a Congressman Swalwell actually basically compare all Hispanic citizens in the United
[49:48.360 --> 49:51.400]  States to illegal immigrants, presumed that all of them are.
[49:51.400 --> 49:54.360]  You also had Elizabeth Warren do the same thing at the very beginning and then something
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.720]  the media didn't follow up on, there's almost been no media commentary on, which is this
[49:58.720 --> 50:00.920]  statement by Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[50:00.920 --> 50:05.360]  She said the economy is doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just
[50:05.360 --> 50:09.240]  not for the African-Americans and Latinos whose families are torn apart or whose lives
[50:09.240 --> 50:10.240]  are destroyed.
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.600]  Well, basically what she's saying is that she says the word prison and the first word
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.720]  image that comes to her are black people and brown people.
[50:18.720 --> 50:22.900]  That gives you a sense of the kind of bigotry and prejudice that the soft prejudice that
[50:22.900 --> 50:27.080]  exists throughout the liberal community and particularly amongst Democratic candidates.
[50:27.080 --> 50:31.080]  To for the first thing you to do to talk about African-Americans and Latinos is to reference
[50:31.080 --> 50:34.600]  them in regards to prison gives you an idea for what is happening.
[50:34.600 --> 50:38.120]  In fact, the majority of prisoners are not African-American or Latino.
[50:38.120 --> 50:41.640]  So it gives you an idea for where her mindset is and where the, and the fact that media
[50:41.640 --> 50:46.040]  had no follow-up on it whatsoever, just like the quasi-Spanish that was being listened
[50:46.040 --> 50:47.880]  to where all kinds of people were commenting.
[50:47.880 --> 50:52.480]  And it sounded like people who think of the Spanish accent and they take an English word
[50:52.480 --> 50:55.440]  and they say hello as their form of hello.
[50:55.440 --> 50:58.440]  So it was just faco across the board.
[50:58.440 --> 51:02.040]  But it wasn't the only sort of miscues last night and misdeeds last night.
[51:02.040 --> 51:08.800]  There was a meltdown as the president mocked and satirized in multiple formats of the,
[51:08.800 --> 51:12.240]  both NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo were co-hosting it.
[51:12.240 --> 51:16.880]  And they had multiple breakdowns on Mike failures, multiple breakdowns on blackouts and visual
[51:16.880 --> 51:17.880]  failures.
[51:17.880 --> 51:19.560]  They had to go to multiple breaks.
[51:19.560 --> 51:23.720]  They actually lost debate time because of their failures to just do basic technical
[51:23.720 --> 51:25.680]  communication.
[51:25.680 --> 51:31.040]  And so the, in fact, there's a, well, let's go to a video on it, the number eight, the,
[51:31.040 --> 51:34.840]  they had to go to commercial repeatedly after technical difficulties.
[51:34.840 --> 51:39.880]  This was the embarrassment of last night's clown world, first stage one, round one debates.
[51:39.880 --> 51:43.200]  I go with guns and Senator Warren, I want to start with you.
[51:43.200 --> 51:49.720]  We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting
[51:49.720 --> 51:50.720]  last year.
[51:50.720 --> 51:54.640]  And where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since.
[51:54.640 --> 51:58.040]  Many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban.
[51:58.040 --> 52:03.080]  But even if implemented, there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country.
[52:03.080 --> 52:06.680]  Could there be a role for the federal government?
[52:06.680 --> 52:07.680]  Everybody's Mike Saran.
[52:07.680 --> 52:10.120]  I think we have a, I heard that too.
[52:10.120 --> 52:11.120]  That's okay.
[52:11.120 --> 52:13.440]  I think we had a little mic issue in the back.
[52:13.440 --> 52:14.440]  Control room.
[52:14.440 --> 52:15.440]  We've got.
[52:15.440 --> 52:16.440]  We have the, I think we heard.
[52:16.440 --> 52:17.440]  Yeah.
[52:17.440 --> 52:18.440]  We have the audience audio.
[52:18.440 --> 52:19.560]  All right.
[52:19.560 --> 52:23.200]  So the question is simply this, we're talking, we're from, I apologize, you guys didn't get
[52:23.200 --> 52:25.680]  to hear this, the first part of the question.
[52:25.680 --> 52:28.240]  Obviously we're not far from Parkland, Florida.
[52:28.240 --> 52:34.080]  Gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in Broward County.
[52:34.080 --> 52:36.400]  Many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions.
[52:36.400 --> 52:39.120]  Some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban.
[52:39.120 --> 52:44.280]  But even if it's put in place, there's still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of
[52:44.280 --> 52:45.520]  guns still on the streets.
[52:45.520 --> 52:50.720]  Is there a role for the federal government in order to play in order to get these guns
[52:50.720 --> 52:51.720]  off the streets?
[52:51.720 --> 52:53.720]  I almost got my finger.
[52:53.720 --> 52:54.720]  You're laughing.
[52:54.720 --> 52:57.800]  You're laughing at the technical thing.
[52:57.800 --> 52:59.680]  We are hearing our colleagues audio.
[52:59.680 --> 53:06.800]  If the control room can turn off the mics, yeah, if the control room can turn off the
[53:06.800 --> 53:14.640]  mics of our previous moderators, we will, you know, we've prepared for everything.
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.240]  Guess what guys, we are going to take a quick break.
[53:18.240 --> 53:21.600]  We're going to get this technical situation fixed.
[53:21.600 --> 53:22.600]  We will be right back.
[53:22.600 --> 53:27.600]  They didn't prepare for the only thing they were really supposed to prepare for.
[53:27.600 --> 53:32.360]  So I mean, they didn't prepare to ask scandal questions about the various scandals and controversies
[53:32.360 --> 53:34.080]  involving any of these candidates.
[53:34.080 --> 53:38.220]  They didn't pose any meaningful policy-based questions that had any substance of detail
[53:38.220 --> 53:40.160]  beyond one or two.
[53:40.160 --> 53:45.000]  They accepted answers like, what is your biggest geopolitical risk to the United States?
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.600]  And they mentioned things that were not geopolitical risks, things that aren't actual countries.
[53:50.600 --> 53:52.760]  In other cases, they contradicted each other.
[53:52.760 --> 53:57.160]  They said China and climate change, well, if they really did care about climate change,
[53:57.160 --> 54:02.080]  then China would be their main concern rather than the United States mining and manufacturing.
[54:02.080 --> 54:06.240]  So their only thing they had to do was to make sure the mics work and they end up with
[54:06.240 --> 54:10.680]  when the most memorable thing from a democratic debate, aside from its failed ratings, aside
[54:10.680 --> 54:14.280]  from the surprise winner of President Trump and Tulsi Gabbard, the one candidate they
[54:14.280 --> 54:20.240]  didn't want to develop any momentum with, when the main other thing is the failure to
[54:20.240 --> 54:24.760]  actually have the mics work and the video and the cameras work, the only things you
[54:24.760 --> 54:25.760]  had to prepare for.
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.360]  That gives you a sense of how bad the media has got to in the democratic debate process.
[54:30.360 --> 54:34.160]  But in addition to that, of course, the President himself had multiple comments on it.
[54:34.160 --> 54:37.440]  Talked about how embarrassing and humiliating that was for a major media network to not
[54:37.440 --> 54:40.800]  get basic broadcasting simple correct.
[54:40.800 --> 54:47.080]  But the Carpe Dictum, the famous meme maker, had a wonderful meme that the President himself
[54:47.080 --> 54:53.000]  retweeted that is also driving the press crazy today, that made clear here was the real reason
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.840]  for the technical defects and explains the technical defects well, so let's go to video
[54:57.840 --> 54:58.840]  number five.
[54:58.840 --> 55:00.840]  Senator Warren, I want to start with you.
[55:00.840 --> 55:07.120]  We are less than 50 miles from Parkland, Florida where 17 people were killed in a school
[55:07.120 --> 55:26.800]  business.
[55:26.800 --> 55:28.800]  We are hearing on Holly's audio.
[55:28.800 --> 55:29.800]  I am.
[55:29.800 --> 55:31.800]  It's a control room and a lot of lights.
[55:31.800 --> 55:34.800]  It's a control room.
[55:34.800 --> 55:36.800]  It turns on.
[55:36.800 --> 55:37.800]  It's on.
[55:37.800 --> 55:38.800]  It's on.
[55:38.800 --> 55:39.800]  It's on.
[55:39.800 --> 55:40.800]  It's on.
[55:40.800 --> 55:41.800]  It's on.
[55:41.800 --> 55:42.800]  It's on.
[55:42.800 --> 55:43.800]  It's on.
[55:43.800 --> 55:44.800]  It's on.
[55:44.800 --> 55:45.800]  It's on.
[55:45.800 --> 55:46.800]  It's on.
[55:46.800 --> 55:47.800]  It's on.
[55:47.800 --> 56:03.800]  It's on.
[56:03.800 --> 56:08.580]  Making Award was a was a right at it right away and the president retweeted it again
[56:08.900 --> 56:14.260]  And so the media sorted and again the real winner last night was the president United States the real winner probably tonight
[56:14.300 --> 56:17.660]  Will be President Trump as well and the question is going to be
[56:18.140 --> 56:20.780]  Aside from all the other aspects of the Democratic debate last night
[56:20.780 --> 56:26.500]  One of the key aspects is the questions that were not asked the scandals that were not covered the controversies that were not
[56:26.900 --> 56:30.540]  Looked at not even a simple basic question that could give rise to it
[56:30.540 --> 56:36.000]  You had people like senator Booker and we'll get into the some of the scandals that were covered up last night by the press and the
[56:36.000 --> 56:41.420]  Democratic debate senator Booker was asked questions about Wall Street and asked questions about big pharma
[56:41.420 --> 56:43.760]  Well, what stands out about senator Booker?
[56:43.880 --> 56:49.620]  He is the number one recipient of big drug company money of any senator in the United States Senate
[56:49.620 --> 56:56.180]  He is one of the top recipients of Wall Street money of any senator in the United States Senate
[56:56.180 --> 57:03.500]  They failed to ask that simple question. How was he in fact? He was the lead opponent to blocking the president's ability to negotiate for
[57:03.500 --> 57:07.780]  Lower drug prices so other the press was covering that aspect up for him
[57:07.820 --> 57:15.020]  The question is they also didn't ask Elizabeth Warren senator Warren the simple question about how can she be president United States when she can't
[57:15.020 --> 57:20.860]  Even get a DNA test right so these aspects will be but we'll get into not only the scandals that were covered up last night
[57:20.860 --> 57:27.620]  But whether they'll ask about the scandals tonight. What about Joker Joe and creepy sleepy uncle Joe Biden in his me too moment?
[57:27.620 --> 57:30.340]  That's gonna be tonight on the Democratic clown world stage
[57:30.540 --> 57:37.260]  What about Biden's involvement in China Ukraine the millions of dollars the billion-dollar contract the government surveillance
[57:37.460 --> 57:40.660]  Technology that was used and sold to China. We're gonna get into all of it
[57:40.660 --> 57:43.020]  So stay here with us on the Alex Jones show
[57:43.020 --> 57:47.740]  I'll be guest hosting come back as we get into the real scandals the media will try to cover up tonight. I
[57:47.740 --> 57:56.420]  Just want listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this at stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now
[57:56.420 --> 58:01.980]  With the save info or 50% off, but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff
[58:01.980 --> 58:08.180]  We're making like two dollars on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving a ton. Okay, but you move a couple hundred thousand dollars
[58:08.180 --> 58:12.860]  Is something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew
[58:12.860 --> 58:16.020]  So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a product
[58:16.020 --> 58:18.940]  I want to expand not contract and for six months
[58:18.940 --> 58:24.500]  We've not just met a stance till the enemy's been winning and I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this
[58:24.500 --> 58:28.460]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting and we are winning the info war
[58:28.460 --> 58:33.140]  That's why we're so hated, but we need to be retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up
[58:33.140 --> 58:34.540]  We never have time to get into drive up
[58:34.540 --> 58:37.900]  We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us
[58:38.100 --> 58:42.860]  Then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me or you or anybody else
[58:42.860 --> 58:48.860]  I mean the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the tricom so go to info war store com
[58:50.660 --> 58:54.940]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square
[58:54.940 --> 59:01.660]  The only thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or
[59:01.660 --> 59:06.940]  Corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government
[59:06.940 --> 59:13.940]  It is completely independent of all that it is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of
[59:13.940 --> 59:18.740]  Press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[59:18.740 --> 59:20.740]  They actually tried to support and subsidize
[59:21.300 --> 59:27.040]  Organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[59:27.140 --> 59:31.500]  Co-opted by big corporation or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[59:31.500 --> 59:38.060]  What news and views the other person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that
[59:38.060 --> 59:43.420]  The they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom
[59:43.420 --> 59:49.740]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[59:49.740 --> 59:59.020]  You're listening to the alex joneshow
[59:59.020 --> 01:00:07.620]  Welcome back to the alex joneshow guest host robert barns
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:16.420]  We're gonna be talking more about the democratic debate the scandals that have been covered up to date the scandals that they may not
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:21.020]  Ask about tonight, but should the scandals that were covered up last night the
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:31.020]  But as part of that let's discuss some of the one of the other interpretations even the new york time said the democratic debate exposed how the democratic party has moved far to the left
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:39.020]  The most conservatives really haven't budged so that much in their political opinions over the past 20 to 30 years. They still oppose dumb wars
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:45.020]  They still support meaningful borders. They still support protecting the democratic party
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:56.020]  They still oppose dumb wars. They still support meaningful borders. They still support protecting independent economic opportunity for the little person a little guy in the everyday business in this country
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:09.020]  But let's go to one of the more interesting statements tonight we'll go to video number 10 last night was julien castrow decided that he was not only pro abortion for as many people as possible
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:17.020]  He also was for abortion rights for people who cannot even get pregnant in the first place. Let's go to video excerpt number 10
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:27.020]  This for you all of you on stage support a woman's right to an abortion you all support some version of a government health care option would your plan cover abortion Mr. Secretary
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:34.020]  Yes, it would. I don't believe only in reproductive freedom. I believe in reproductive justice
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:45.020]  And you know what that means is that just because a woman or let's also not forget someone in the trans community a trans female
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:56.020]  Is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have exercise that right to choose and so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion more than that
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:07.020]  Everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri in Alabama in Georgia
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:14.020]  I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade and respect it
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:23.020]  And in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get an exercise that
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:31.020]  So you have taxpayer supported taxpayer subsidized taxpayer paid for abortions even for people who cannot biologically get pregnant
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:40.020]  But that wasn't the only crazy statements made last night. You also had Senator Klobacher from this Minnesota who mostly was in the nervous most of the evening
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:49.020]  With her big time on the big stage and not ready for it. Also talking about how when they take your gun away that's really just a voluntary action
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:03:01.020]  Let me go to video excerpt number 11. Let me give 30 seconds. Senator Klobacher iron range. I'm curious gun confiscation right if the government is buying back
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:10.020]  How do you how do you not have that conversation. That's not confiscation you give them the offer to buy back their gun but I'll say this I look at these proposals and I say
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:19.020]  Does this hurt my uncle Dick and his dear stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state. These proposals don't do that. When I was a prosecutor I supported the assault weapon ban
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:29.020]  When I was in the Senate I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed and then now these Parkland kids from Florida
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:40.020]  They started a literally a national shift you know why it's just like with gay marriage when kids talk to their parents and their grandparents they say I don't understand where we can't put these sensible things in place
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:53.020]  They listen and if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds it's the best thing that ever happened. So there you have her in fact what was amazing was all the Democratic candidates at different times were asked a very specific question
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:04:01.020]  Would they take away gun rights of ordinary Americans would they would they change the meaning of the Second Amendment by trying to pack the court as many of them have talked about
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:09.020]  Would they try to get the Second Amendment reversed by Department of Justice policies and arguments would they respect the Second Amendment rights and would they extend those to ordinary Americans
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:19.020]  And they couldn't answer the question and instead they had tried to convince people that buy backs are really just voluntary ways in which to take away people's rights to bear arms
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:29.020]  They didn't talk about the main mechanism that Israel and other countries have used to defend themselves including defend schools against school shootings which include the right of teachers to be able to arm and defend themselves
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:38.020]  So you had the craziness that took place last night you had the surprise winners last night you're the not so surprising losers last night let's preview the Democratic debates coming up tonight
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:53.020]  What scandals will be gone into will they talk about Joe Joker Joe and his me too moment will they talk about the issues related to Ukraine and China will they talk about whether or not Joker Joe Biden was involved in selling military secrets to the Chinese
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:05:09.020]  Whether or not the whether or not his son's connections raised questions of corruption
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:23.020]  I want to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars you went and looked it up and found out the truth
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:41.020]  I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart and I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:53.020]  That's not what's important the enemy could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God you're being used by God this is Providence so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:06:13.020]  Info Wars the most banned network in the world
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:29.020]  I'm standing up against those that are destroying this country as we speak and why am I fired up because this is war absolute unabated total war against our nation
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:41.020]  We bring life we bring death we are men we are women we are the humans we are the planet we are God's creation we are the future not you death
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:47.020]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War we don't fear death
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:51.020]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:07:20.020]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:27.020]  Info Wars the most banned network in the world
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:46.020]  We can have fun and we can joke and we can laugh about Clown World and the ridiculous display of ineptitude and competency that took place last night and is obviously coming up tonight in round two of the low energy screeching
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:55.020]  But remember these individuals have been able working with the chai comms and others to take control of our nation and they have a criminal will
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:08:09.020]  So on the surface we see the evident mental illness the criminal grasping and we see these kleptocrats as pathetic because they are but they're organized and they mean business
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:21.020]  And you saw the giant tech companies in the last few weeks hype and promote these debates as if it was the second coming of Christ or the invention of the wheel or the discovery of fire
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:29.020]  And you saw how they concertedly from Reddit to Google to Facebook shut anyone down that made any negative comments
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:42.020]  And yes it blew up in their face because the product sucks you can't polish a turd you can't put lipstick on a pig but they still aren't aware of how they look or how they come off or what they're doing
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:48.020]  They're still organized they're still in power and they're still moving forward against us that's it
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:09:04.020]  This is double-sided they are falling apart they're starting to become self aware the entire public worldwide is turning against globalism and leftist victimology but that's the problem
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:17.020]  Now they're cornered rats and they've destroyed so many civilizations they're going to try to accelerate cloward and piven and bring down the system because that's their only shot they believe at maintaining control
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:33.020]  So we are truly in a catch 22 but yes the no energy the no crowds the technical difficulties the low energy despite the fact they look like they've been taking amphetamines almost all of them
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:51.020]  This is a great opportunity for everyone but again it's also a great danger because as I've just said they are dug in and they are backed up by the globalist and by Silicon Valley who is actively stealing the 2020 election and actively stole the house
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:10:03.020]  Conservatively in the midterms last year we've seen them pull out the stops with the fake rape allegations you've seen them pull out the stops with the Jesse Smollett hoaxes and the Covington kids
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:12.020]  You've seen them pull out the stops with me and you know and trying to set me up a child porn you've seen all of and they're just getting started this isn't a regular time
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:23.020]  This is a major global political realignment against the technocracy and if we don't take it as deadly serious like cancer they're going to win
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:27.020]  We have all the opportunities on our hands to stop them but we've got to do it
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:47.020]  We need the listeners of this broadcast to the globalists to see as their number one enemy because you are their enemy the heart of the resistance worldwide to understand how important you are and to redouble your efforts like modern Paul Revere's to tell everyone about this broadcast and other broadcasts that tell the truth and other websites that tell the truth like DrudgeReport.com
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:11:01.020]  and Tucker Carlson and others this is so critical we're pro-human we're anti-offensive war we're pro-family we're pro-self-defense we are the classical liberals they are the fascist left and they must be defeated
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:11.020]  but only you aggressively telling the truth will defeat them that's why they've demonized me as a psychological inoculation so people won't be at my side
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:18.020]  so that we won't promote each other so that we'll be ashamed of who we are instead of proud of who we are and how far we've come together I'm proud of you
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:24.020]  damn proud of you and I'm proud of the crew and info wars and what they put up with what they go through without them we wouldn't be here
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:39.020]  so I salute every single one of you back to Robert Barnes and the live global transmission don't forget tonight 7 o'clock Central Part 2 of the giant train wreck derailment that is so horrible and so boring it's riveting
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:43.020]  back to Robert Barnes
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:53.020]  glad to be guest hosting with the Alex Jones show here from Austin Texas reviewing the clown world even Donald Trump Jr. was using the clown world terminology last night
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:12:04.020]  it was one of his most popular tweets about the democratic debate and when you get into what the clown world means you look into what it unveils while they're jumping up and down and celebrating the death of the unborn
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:12.020]  you basically see them going to such degree that they're going to protect the abortion rights of those who cannot even get pregnant in the first place
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:25.020]  and it reminds you how the left has created sort of a cultish culture around the sort of pagan god of abortion that is discriminatorily disparately impacting African American and Latino communities in the United States
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:36.020]  so let's if you look at that sort of broad scale and wholesale it's happening repeatedly and routinely and it poses an ongoing and present threat to the well-being of our civil society
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:43.020]  and it's why what you do in supporting it for wars is so critical and so key you saw last night what happens when the mainstream media gets to control debates
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:55.020]  you have conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow who promoted one of the most dangerous, one of the most riskiest, one of the most reckless conspiracy theories in American political and media history and the Russiagate nonsense
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:04.020]  get to be one of the questioners on the debate, you have Chuck Todd whose ideological advocacy has masked any the ability to be objective in the media process
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:15.020]  you have Lester Holt whose infamous for spreading fake news of a widespread and wide scale kind, that's what happens when big corporations and Hollywood industry and leftist cultural values
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:21.020]  a form of fascism and statism of its own accord dominate and control the public narrative
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:25.020]  that is why what you do here for info wars by supporting the info wars store
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:33.020]  you are basically seizing the power from the big corporations from the sort of liberal class elite and you are giving that power to yourself
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:39.020]  you are making sure that you get the news and views you want to have and the news and views you want to share
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:45.020]  this is the American experiment applied to the independent free press to create that free press
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:52.020]  because info wars is beyond Alex Jones info wars is you the audience the public who make it happen who make it real
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:59.020]  by your independent coverage you receive news and you make sure others receive news that otherwise wouldn't be told and wouldn't be spread
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:06.020]  that's why info wars continues its 50% off save info wars sale throughout the entire week for July 4th
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:13.020]  by doing so the American independence was predicated on the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, the freedom of thought
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:17.020]  the freedom of an independent marketplace that supports the ordinary individuals rights
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:24.020]  and that can only happen that can only manifest itself if by you taking the choice to seize control
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:30.020]  give the power to yourself by supporting info wars by basically purchasing things you are going to purchase anyway
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:37.020]  I have been a subscriber for some time the coffee is actually one of the best I am a coffee snob and it is one of the best coffees in the world
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:45.020]  but you choose which products you like and you are choosing products that are highly rated that have been tested
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:50.020]  that people can look at and have you almost universally enjoyed and you decide whether you like it
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:54.020]  but in doing so you seize the power to control what press exists in the United States
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.020]  what speech exists in the United States and as we come back after the break
[01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:05.020]  we will discuss the attempts at big tech to control speech in the same way big media is trying to control narrative
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:10.020]  Project Veritas has more whistleblower leaks, more whistleblower reports
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.020]  what has that led to more censorship and more suppression
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.020]  YouTube continues to suppress Project Veritas' report
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.020]  Google continues to suppress Project Veritas' report
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:25.020]  now you even have Vimeo and Pinterest suppressing various Project Veritas' reports
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.020]  you even have Reddit suppressing Project Veritas' reports
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:31.020]  so as we come back we will discuss the war on big tech
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:37.020]  the Google exposed Project Veritas project that was discussed yesterday in Congress
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:43.020]  as Congressman Crenshaw and Senator Cruz exposed further Google employees attempting to commit more perjury
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.020]  or evade perjury for their big tech censorship
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.020]  so come back after and join the show as we discuss in further
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:16:17.020]  how big tech is finally being exposed and we can restore American democracy once and for all with a real independent free press
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:28.020]  our microwavable heat wraps, heatable neck pillows and extra large body wraps are designed better for perfect support
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.020]  where and when you need it

[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:24.020]  debate, let's meet the candidates, all star, Beto Roy, oh my gosh, Cory Booker, the amazing,
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:34.020]  good old Pocahontas, Joe Biden, swallows well, says the new gun owners, yay, Bernie, Dennis,
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.020]  lunch, the Soviet Union, Kamala Harris, and so many more.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:44.020]  It's the greatest show on earth at infowars.com for its last show, Wednesday and Thursday nights.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:50.020]  The greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:58.020]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7pm at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:03.020]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:08.020]  the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:15.020]  The false claim that you purposely sent kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous,
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:20.020]  as well as false, it's a smear, somebody sends you something that's encrypted,
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:25.020]  you don't even open it, it ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.020]  and then it's blamed on you.
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:32.020]  This is Kafkaesque, this is bizarre, but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:36.020]  Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:40.020]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:43.020]  and corrected and clarified, but I wonder where are the big boys?
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:46.020]  Where's the Wall Street Journal? Where's Associated Press?
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:52.020]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:20:17.020]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:29.020]  Back as a guest host, Robert Barnes, turning Robert Barnes on behalf of Alex Jones here
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:33.020]  in the Alex Jones show from Austin, Texas, discussing the clown show that took place
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:37.020]  last night and the clown show that's up again tonight at part two, the sequel.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.020]  We'll see if it's any better.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:43.020]  What happened last night was also interesting in terms of Infowars had people on the ground there
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:48.020]  and typically in a democratic debate, you're going to have each of the party, each of the candidates.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:53.020]  You have 10 different candidates just for tonight, 10 more that are up on the stage last night.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:58.020]  Usually they're going to have their supporters out and about to get people excited to talk to local press,
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:03.020]  to talk to international press, to talk to the bevy of press that's there, to get out their message,
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:07.020]  to show enthusiasm for their campaign, to show enthusiasm for their candidate,
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.020]  to show enthusiasm for their party and their policies.
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:13.020]  Yet there was almost nobody there on behalf of any of the democratic candidates
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:16.020]  as they can't gin up any degree of enthusiasm.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.020]  What they have is what's called in Washington an astroturf campaign
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:23.020]  where they don't have real grassroots support, they have to lay it down in a fake way.
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:28.020]  And that's because the Democratic Party has sort of lost touch with a lot of ordinary voters
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.020]  and doesn't get the excitement and enthusiasm that President Trump did.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:36.020]  Because that's who's had the biggest, as we said the surprise winner last night was President Trump himself,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:40.020]  who had the biggest turnout last night for people outside.
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.020]  It was President Trump.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:46.020]  It was the one who had the biggest rally of supporters outside the democratic debates.
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:50.020]  So not a surprise that that is the case or that it went that way.
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:55.020]  And that's in part because the Democratic Party has lost touch with the mainstream of the ordinary American voter.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:22:01.020]  On issues like abortion, that's how you get Senator Booker trying to win the intersectional prize
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.020]  for the oppression Olympics by saying that not enough talk takes place
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:12.020]  for transgendered African Americans who are a tiny, tiny, tiny percent of the entire American electorate.
[01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:20.020]  That's how you get people like Julian Castro saying that what we need out there is to have abortion rights
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.020]  for people who can't even get pregnant.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:28.020]  Which takes us to the sort of the whole culture and the cult of abortion that is built up around the Democratic Party.
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:36.020]  The Democratic Party goes to Lutlenc's last night, Senator Warren refused to say that there was any abortion that she would not approve of.
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:41.020]  Including whether an eight and a half month viable baby that's actually partially born,
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.020]  she wouldn't even say that that abortion should be outlawed.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:52.020]  And that's the kind of culture and the cult of abortion that has come about in the Margaret Sanger leftist world of the modern day
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:58.020]  that's against what a lot of Catholic Democrats believe, against what a lot of evangelical African American Democrats believe.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:04.020]  So let's look at a video that talks about how much the left has come to celebrate and create a cult around abortion
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:09.020]  if we can go to video number two on the main list.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:16.020]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants. Some are against them, others believe they're fine in rare cases
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:20.020]  and many believe you should be able to get them whenever the f*** you want.
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.020]  Sorry, did I say breast implants? I meant abortions.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:28.020]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:35.020]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the break, take the annual salute to abortion!
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:42.020]  Get out of my behind! Get out of my vagina! Get out!
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:46.020]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:50.020]  You wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm? She'd have the heartbeat.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:54.020]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm? A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:58.020]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay? It's a club of cells in 12 weeks.
[01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.020]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.020]  How many did you adopt? How many? How many did I adopt? I kill my kids.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:10.020]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh? Yeah, I love it. You love it, huh? Yeah, I do.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:14.020]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir. Oh, I'd ever go to Christ.
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:18.020]  No, I don't go to Christ. A fertilized egg is a human being!
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:22.020]  Yeah. A fertilized egg is a human being? You're a pig. Because I don't want to come to babies.
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:26.020]  Oh, you killed them. You let them live so they can starve to death.
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.020]  Why'd you spit at us? I don't agree with you.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:34.020]  No uterus, no right to talk about it. Understand me, mother f***er?
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:38.020]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother,
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:44.020]  just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that's okay,
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:48.020]  and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:52.020]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases, and using that kind of
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.020]  scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.020]  lit up the One World Trade Center's Spire in Pink to celebrate
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:04.020]  his erotical expansion of abortion in New York. State law,
[01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:08.020]  makers approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any reason
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.020]  until the 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:16.020]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:20.020]  The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable,
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.020]  the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:28.020]  desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:34.020]  Are you for third trimester abortions? My answer to you is that that should be a decision
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:40.020]  that the woman makes. There's scientific consensus that the lives of
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:44.020]  children are going to be very difficult. Is it okay to still have children?
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.020]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:52.020]  to rent in this city for free?
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:58.020]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.020]  Next speaker. Here's a new video out on informers.com
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:06.020]  of two partial birth abortion
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.020]  eight and a half month old babies.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:14.020]  And it makes you want to kill people. I'm just being honest with you right now.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:18.020]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:22.020]  who got killed and it's brain sucked out by some asshole
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:26.020]  and then they make a joke out of it. These are abortion doctors
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.020]  with third trimester babies that were about to be born.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.020]  The filing them, the jokes about them that they're having a fight.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:38.020]  They're playing with dead babies in a little
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:42.020]  medical pan and it was pretty shocking through some stuff to see
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.020]  and just total lack of regard for humanity. It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:50.020]  We're going to have Abby Johnson.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:54.020]  I'm sorry. God bless abortions and God bless America!
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:58.020]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.020]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.020]  You know, you got to get that baby out of there.
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:10.020]  It's a culture that just doesn't celebrate life
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:14.020]  but it also is a culture that's hypocritical. So for example
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:18.020]  today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has joined
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:22.020]  by a range of people questioning various aspects of vaccines.
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:26.020]  In particular asking questions about whether they're always necessary, whether they're always safe.
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:30.020]  And what's unique here is that the argument there is
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:34.020]  why isn't it, if it's my kid, my child, why isn't it
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:38.020]  my body, my choice, my kid, my choice? Why does it suddenly become
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:42.020]  the government's choice? Why does it suddenly become the government can force an invasive
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:46.020]  aspect into your body and yet
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:50.020]  you're supposed to be able to have the choice to remove a life from
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:54.020]  permanent existence. So there's the inconsistent hypocrisy between
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:58.020]  how vaccinations are treated in the press and in the public versus how
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:02.020]  abortions have been celebrated by large parts of the left. And that continues
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:06.020]  to happen across the democratic spectrum in ways that actually
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:10.020]  is not connected to large numbers of democratic voters. There are a large number
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:14.020]  that the far left does not dominate in the actual number of democratic voters.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:18.020]  Many African-American voters are culturally conservative in pro-life. Many Latino
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:22.020]  voters are culturally conservative in pro-life. Many working class democratic
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.020]  voters are culturally conservative in pro-life. And yet the abortion
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:30.020]  mantra has taken over the democratic part. So it's not the only thing that's
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:34.020]  crazy in clown world. There are other aspects of clown world such as the
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:38.020]  corruption scandals that have been covered up by the mainstream press. Will they be
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.020]  discussed tonight? Will they be reviewed tonight? That's the question. We'll get
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.020]  into some of those scandals that the mainstream press does not want to talk about. We'll talk
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:50.020]  about Joker Joe. We'll talk about China, Ukraine. We'll talk about Kamala Harris
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:54.020]  and the Lenard Corporation and Nancy Pelosi. We'll talk about all the scandals
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.020]  right as we come back. So come join us.

[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:06.020]  house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:10.020]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:02.020]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become? Big Tech are big babies that have
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:06.020]  become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:10.020]  economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades. And because of
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:14.020]  that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.020]  that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:22.020]  real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.020]  will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:30.020]  of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:34.020]  down until we were able to recover after the Great Depression. The informer's audience is the fuel
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:38.020]  that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:42.020]  the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:46.020]  independent free press. Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:50.020]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.020]  and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gas
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:58.020]  lighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:02.020]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:06.020]  of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:10.020]  through their criminal activity and their digital fraud and we need to know
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:14.020]  that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to end here. We need to be
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:18.020]  provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.020]  against the enemy fearlessly. I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:26.020]  getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:30.020]  heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies. That just brings more people here.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:34.020]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:38.020]  gas. I need ammo politically now. But literally if you flood us with
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:42.020]  money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth,
[01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:46.020]  you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together. I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:50.020]  a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:54.020]  you will stand with us and I will never back down. You have my commitment. This only
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:58.020]  means more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:02.020]  Briefly folks, please do not forget. This is the Maximum Alert.
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:06.020]  We wouldn't be here without you. I thank you for your support and your help. We're going to be steadfast in this fight
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.020]  but we need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons

[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:05.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:09.020]  If you are receiving
[01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:13.020]  this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.020]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:21.020]  Robert Barnes, a guest hosting for Alex Jones and the Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:25.020]  Covering the Clown World, there was a Democratic debate last night and then we'll continue
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:29.020]  with Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:33.020]  Robert Barnes, a guest hosting for Alex Jones and the Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.020]  There was a Democratic debate last night and then we'll continue again tonight.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:41.020]  We'll also be looking at what happened outside the Democratic debate,
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.020]  including how the media covered it or chose to cover up certain aspects, including various
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.020]  scandals that they should be asking about tonight, but the question is whether they will be.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:53.020]  But one of the other aspects that happened last night was that
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.020]  we had reporters on the ground interviewing all kinds of people, including the Lieutenant Governor
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.020]  of California, other political officials, but also other media personalities including
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:05.020]  infamously the Young Turks.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:09.020]  Infowars and Alex Jones has had a history with the Young Turks. The Young Turks recently libeled Alex Jones
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:13.020]  with false accusations that will be the subject of a potential future lawsuit if they don't take
[01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:17.020]  corrective and retractive action. But in addition, the reporters on the
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.020]  ground also ran into the Young Turks. So let's go to that video. I think it's
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:25.020]  video number two on our new list. And that goes into detail
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:29.020]  what happened when our Infowars reporters met up with
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:33.020]  the Young Turks at the Democratic debate last night.
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:37.020]  We're doing a show. So I'm tired of it. Are you supporting fake news?
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.020]  We're disrupting every show we do. Viewer discretion is advised.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:45.020]  T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T!
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:49.020]  T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T!
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:55.020]  T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T! T-Y-T!
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.020]  Sorry, sorry, I'm in the media.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.020]  Rise visit by Bernie Sanders!
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:06.020]  That's why you can't miss any of these rallies!
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.020]  You never know who's gonna come by!
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:11.020]  You never know who's gonna come by!
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.020]  Live here we've got myself,
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:26.020]  Anna Kisferian!
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:29.020]  Already early today, Eric Bowling came by,
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:34.020]  and Anna Chase is off!
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.020]  Why don't you run for president, Chuck?
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:39.020]  First, Anna Kisferian everyone!
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:42.020]  Why don't you run for president, Chuck?
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.020]  Chuck, why don't you run for president?
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.020]  Yes, please!
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.020]  Why don't you run for president?
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.020]  Why don't you run for president?
[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:54.020]  Come on, we need you to run!
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.020]  Run, Chunk!
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.020]  So this is what democracy looks like.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.020]  And I have no interest in censoring anyone, right?
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:07.020]  As long as there's an interest in having an honest debate.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.020]  Except for info wars!
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:12.020]  Except for info wars!
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.020]  We want censorship!
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:18.020]  Censorship!
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:21.020]  Yes, we can then maybe become the great country
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.020]  that ban hate speech pretends to be.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.020]  Ban hate speech!
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.020]  Ban hate speech!
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.020]  We want China!
[01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:31.020]  Progressive Change Campaign Committee
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.020]  has been fighting the good fight
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:36.020]  for a long, long time, for as long as I can remember.
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:39.020]  What I love, and you all know from the young Turks,
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.020]  is bold progressives.
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:45.020]  Jake, why did you talk about it?
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:47.020]  No, why did you want to have info wars
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.020]  in Alex Jones' band?
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.020]  Why should we ban it, Alex Jones?
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:55.020]  Why should we ban it?
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.020]  Why should we ban it?
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:00.020]  Are you supporting hate speech?
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.020]  Get away from me.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.020]  Are you supporting hate speech, Jake?
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:06.020]  We're doing a show.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.020]  Are you supporting fake news?
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.020]  We're supporting every show we do.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.020]  We don't mind, please leave.
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.020]  Why are you getting in front of me, man?
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:16.020]  Because I'm part of this and you're not.
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:18.020]  You can hold it that way. I got you.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.020]  If you want to, you're me.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.020]  As Americans who care.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:25.020]  Why did you lie about Alex Jones, Jake?
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:28.020]  Why did you lie about Alex Jones?
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:30.020]  We don't want to be accused.
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.020]  Who here is genuinely inspired?
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:34.020]  Why did you try to act like Alex Jones
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:36.020]  was sending child porn to Zania's family?
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.020]  You're in my ass.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.020]  Jake, why is it okay to spread hoaxes
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:46.020]  saying that Alex Jones was sending child porn
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:50.020]  to the Sandy Hook parents?
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:52.020]  Was absolutely not true.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.020]  Anyone who did their due diligence
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.020]  could have known that, Jake.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.020]  You called for Alex to be banned,
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:02.020]  but you spread hoaxes.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:04.020]  It's not good for people on the left
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:08.020]  to be doing fake news, Jake.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:10.020]  He calls for Alex Jones to be banned
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:12.020]  because he claims Alex spreads hoaxes
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.020]  and fake news,
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:17.020]  but he spreads hoaxes and fake news.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:19.020]  Orange Bad Bad!
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.020]  Orange Bad Bad!
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.020]  Orange Bad Bad!
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.020]  Orange Bad Bad!
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.020]  Orange Bad Bad!
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:28.020]  When John Higginlooper says
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.020]  that who had to care for all
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.020]  is bringing Joseph Stalin back,
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:35.020]  you are not a progressive.
[01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:36.020]  Nope.
[01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.020]  So, the jury's coming
[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:40.020]  out a number of people who are also...
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.020]  Neither are the Young Turks!
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:44.020]  In the global chart!
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.020]  The Young Turks are not progressive!
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.020]  They're not!
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:50.020]  They're not gonna do it.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.020]  What do you think about all this?
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:54.020]  I think it's crazy.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:56.020]  There's some Trump people over there,
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:58.020]  and these people are crazy too.
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.020]  Everyone's crazy.
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.020]  Are you a Trump or are you a CYT?
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.020]  No, I am a progressive,
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.020]  and the Young Turks are not progressive.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.020]  They're not.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:10.020]  They're not.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:12.020]  Do you know what the Young Turks
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.020]  stand for?
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:16.020]  Armenian Genocide.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:18.020]  The Young Turks...
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:20.020]  They name themselves after the Turks
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.020]  who committed Armenian genocide.
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.020]  It's true, look it up.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.020]  Chuck is bad!
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:28.020]  Chuck is bad!
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:30.020]  Chuck is bad!
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:32.020]  Chuck is bad!
[01:39:32.020 --> 01:39:34.020]  Chuck wants censorship!
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:36.020]  Chuck wants censorship!
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.020]  Chuck wants censorship!
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:40.020]  Chuck supports censorship!
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.020]  Chuck supports censorship!
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.020]  He's calling for censorship on the internet.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.020]  I'm okay with that.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.020]  You're okay with censorship?
[01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:50.020]  Yeah. Why?
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:52.020]  I think we should all be censored.
[01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.020]  What are you doing here, you bigot?
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:56.020]  Just being a bigot, I guess.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.020]  I can't believe you're here, you bigot.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.020]  This guy wants free speech.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:02.020]  He's a bigot.
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:04.020]  Chuck spreads hoaxes!
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:06.020]  Oh, it's super funny, huh?
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.020]  It's super embarrassing to spread hoaxes
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.020]  claiming Alex Jones
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.020]  was sending child porn
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.020]  to the Sandy Hook lawyers.
[01:40:14.020 --> 01:40:16.020]  Any journalist could have done
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:18.020]  easy research and known that was
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.020]  not true, Anna.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.020]  I thought that was true.
[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:24.020]  You spread hoaxes
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:26.020]  and you can't handle being called out for it.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:30.020]  Get your sign out of my face.
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.020]  Do all liberals have to have
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.020]  the same opinion, sir?
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:36.020]  Does the rights of freedom of speech
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:38.020]  include the right to yell in people's ears?
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.020]  It does.
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:42.020]  Do all liberals have to support the young Turks?
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:44.020]  Obviously not. You can watch
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:46.020]  whoever you want to watch.
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:48.020]  Exactly, so I can watch who I want to watch
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:50.020]  and I can criticize who I want to watch, can't I?
[01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:52.020]  Will you acknowledge the Armenian genocide?
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:54.020]  I'm not going to talk to you guys.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:56.020]  I've acknowledged it on air a thousand times,
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.020]  so you guys are full of s**t as always.
[01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.020]  Sir, then why do you name your company the Young Turks?
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.020]  I'm not talking to you guys because you're full of s**t.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:04.020]  You're engaged in.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:06.020]  Why do you call for us to be censored?
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:08.020]  I'm not calling for any.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.020]  Can you say free Alex Jones, then?
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:12.020]  So there you are.
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:14.020]  The truth comes out.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:16.020]  Will you denounce censorship?
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.020]  Will you denounce the censorship of info wars?
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:22.020]  TYT!
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:24.020]  TYT!
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.020]  TYT!
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:28.020]  TYT!
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.020]  TYT!
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.020]  He hasn't denounced censorship.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:34.020]  He won't say free Alex Jones.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.020]  TYT!
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:38.020]  Why don't you denounce censorship?
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.020]  TYT!
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:42.020]  And they're protecting you like a bunch of cult members.
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.020]  They're protecting you like a bunch of cult members.
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:46.020]  Will you denounce censorship, Cenk?
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.020]  Careful about the road, guys.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:50.020]  Will you denounce censorship?
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.020]  I'm just looking out for you.
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:54.020]  I'm trying to keep everybody out of it.
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:56.020]  Prove it. Prove we're not telling the truth, Cenk.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.020]  Denounce censorship.
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:00.020]  Denounce the censorship of info wars.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:02.020]  Prove it.
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:04.020]  Y'all looking at my ear, please?
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.020]  You can move. Denounce it, Cenk.
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:08.020]  Denounce the censorship of info wars
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:10.020]  and Alex Jones off social media.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:12.020]  Prove us wrong.
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:14.020]  You won't do it.
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.020]  I already asked him to say free Alex Jones
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:18.020]  and he told me to f**k off.
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.020]  Prove we're wrong and denounce it, Cenk.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.020]  He won't denounce it.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.020]  He supports censorship, apparently.
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.020]  I gave him opportunity
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:55.020]  to say free Alex Jones and he won't say it.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.020]  I just want listeners to understand
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.020]  money is what allows us to beat this
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.020]  and stand against this.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:05.020]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.020]  with the save info wars, 50% off.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.020]  But we make only like $5, $10 on higher
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.020]  marked up stuff.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:13.020]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.020]  And we're moving a ton of it, okay?
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:17.020]  But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.020]  of something and you get $20,000.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:21.020]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth,
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:23.020]  the lawyers, the crew.
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.020]  So we need to sell millions and millions
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:27.020]  of dollars to support the entire McDonald's
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.020]  and all of us will, but we need to
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.020]  look forward to getting this chopped up
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:33.020]  to the next day as we contract.
[01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.020]  And for six months we've not just been
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:37.020]  to stand still, the enemy has been winning
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:39.020]  and I have labored and labored
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:41.020]  and labored on this.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.020]  I like to be expanding, I like to be winning,
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.020]  I like to be fighting.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:47.020]  And we are winning the several war attacks
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:49.020]  while we're so hated.
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.020]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:52.020]  We need to be tuned up, we need to be fixed up.
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:54.020]  We never have time to get it to dry up.
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.820]  and banks of the tricom. So go to InfowarsStore.com.
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:27.020]  The audience determines what content goes up.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:31.020]  The audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Infowars.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.020]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:38.020]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:42.020]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:46.020]  and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:49.020]  what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:56.020]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:02.020]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:07.020]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it is the only network of this reach
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:10.020]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:14.020]  That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:20.020]  It is completely independent of all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:23.020]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:26.020]  That in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.020]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:32.020]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:36.020]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:40.020]  or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:46.020]  the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:51.020]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:55.020]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:58.020]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:04.020]  Serving with Infowars is a great honor but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:10.020]  And luckily our break room at the Infowars headquarters is stock full of high quality
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:14.020]  Infowars store Patriot blend coffee.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:22.020]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:25.020]  at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:30.020]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:34.020]  There has never been a more important time to support Infowars.
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:40.020]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:44.020]  Order now at the Infowars store.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:50.020]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot blend coffee
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:47:01.020]  delivered right to your door at Infowarsstore.com
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:21.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:32.020]  And there you had the value of on-the-ground reporters, on-the-ground investigators, on-the-ground journalists
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:37.020]  challenging and confronting and contesting the misuse and abuse of power by media members
[01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:42.020]  like the Young Turks, by the exposing the fact that there were no real Democratic rallies.
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:47.020]  Even the Young Turks who were trying to do a special rally for their so-called progressive media network
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:53.020]  failed to get many people there present. So about 15, 20 people, maybe it appeared from that rally.
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:56.020]  The same thing in terms of media suppression of what happened.
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:01.020]  If you'll notice, you saw no coverage of what was happening outside the debate halls by the mainstream press.
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:08.020]  Why was that? Because the Democratic candidates couldn't even conjure up five or six or seven supporters
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:12.020]  so that they could even at least create the fiction or the image or the impression of a major rally
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:14.020]  in support of Democratic candidates.
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:19.020]  The only people significantly there were Trump supporters, even though this was a Democratic Party debate.
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:25.020]  That was one of the utilities to having on-the-ground reporting that exposes the truth and advances it directly and honestly.
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:31.020]  That's only possible because you, the audience, support Infowars. You are what creates the Infowars network.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:38.020]  You are the one that allows these news and views to be shared to you, but not only you, but to your friends, your family, and to others.
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:48.020]  You do that by supporting the Infowars store. That is why Alex has extended throughout the July 4th break the 50% off sale that continues at the Infowars store
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:57.020]  where you can buy products that you like, whatever that is, whether that's coffee, whether that's supplements, whether that's t-shirts, whether that's books, whatever you want.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:04.020]  But by doing so, you help support and make real the independent free press, the independent free thought, the independent free speech
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:11.020]  that the entire American little D Democratic experiment is entirely predicated and premised upon.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:15.020]  And that is precisely what the big media and the big tech are trying to collude to stop.
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:23.020]  So for example, recently there has been a onslaught by the big tech and big media together conspiring between media matters and YouTube
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:30.020]  to suppress the very independent voices you just heard challenging the young Turks, exposing Democratic flaws in the Democratic debates,
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:36.020]  exposing the lack of attendance of the Democrats outside to rally in support of their own candidates.
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:46.020]  And for that we even have a video that goes into great detail on it where the media matters and others are trying to target to blacklist, defame, censor, shame, limit,
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:57.020]  restrict the content of news and views that the public can hear and see and witness by trying to get YouTube to remove the channels that simply spread or support
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:50:04.020]  or say something positive in any way, shape or form about the network that you make happen based on your supportive info wars.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:07.020]  So let's go to video excerpt number four.
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:11.020]  I just want to stake this again because I don't like talking about myself every day on the show and what's happening,
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:16.020]  but we're forced to because as you've seen, we're national news, international news.
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:21.020]  If they can take us down, they set the precedent to take everyone else down.
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:28.020]  Media Matters run by George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator. He said that on 60 Minutes. The news says that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:36.020]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours who swore that you were his adopted god son.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.020]  Yes, yes.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:41.020]  Went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:42.020]  That's right.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:52.020]  George Soros is Media Matters. They created a list of sites that post some of my content on YouTube.
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.020]  And here it is.
[01:50:53.020 --> 01:51:01.020]  And most of these I've never even heard of info wars fans, grand tyranny crusher heard of that one.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:06.020]  General Shepard, Eric Miller, Max, I mean, I've hardly heard of any of these baked blunts.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:12.020]  And they said, oh, look, they're posting his content. Take them down. And YouTube did.
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:18.020]  I mean, when Media Matters snaps its fingers and says, jump Google, a trillion dollar company, ask how high?
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:23.020]  Oh, they were a trillion dollar company. They've lost 137 billion since it was announced they're going to be breaking up.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:29.020]  We saw Alphabet stock hit an all time high ahead of its earnings. And now it's dropped about 7% extended hours.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:32.020]  For reference, it's wiped about $80 billion off its market value.
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:37.020]  If I libel somebody, I can be sued. Fox News can be sued. You're a Senator-elect.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:42.020]  If you libel someone on this show, you can be sued. But Apple cannot be sued. Facebook, Google, the rest.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:48.020]  Why should the U.S. government favor those companies in a way that they don't favor my company, for example?
[01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:50.020]  Yeah, I think it's a very good question.
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:54.020]  And look, I mean, let's be honest, these tech companies, Facebook, Google, Twitter, they have gotten huge.
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:52:00.020]  They have gotten powerful. They have gotten rich on the backs of this special immunity that they get from the federal government.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:04.020]  On the back of what's called Section 230. And I think it's time we ask some hard questions.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:07.020]  They're monopolies now. They're very powerful.
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:14.020]  They appear to be using their power to try and shut down political viewpoints that they don't agree with, usually conservative.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:19.020]  And it says every copycat channel listed has been uploaded, enforced content has been removed.
[01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:23.020]  And most now showing a message saying they were terminated for a violation of YouTube's term of service.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:32.020]  The channels for enforcers' personalities remain up. So, other people that we sponsor that are contractors who already had their own channels,
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:37.020]  who wanted to do work with us, who go out and do man on the street, great work, never violate YouTube's strict rules.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:41.020]  How many amendments are in the Bill of Rights?
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:44.020]  Oh, how many amendments?
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:48.020]  Fifty.
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.020]  Fifty.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:55.020]  Millie Weaver and Caitlyn Bennett, they are now targeted for deletion.
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:53:05.020]  And the bosses of Google over at Media Matters in D.C. are very upset. Liberty Hangout seems to mainly post content from enforcers' personality, Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:09.020]  No, it's Caitlyn Bennett, a journalism graduate's site.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:14.020]  A nice young lady. And you don't like her having space, you want to get rid of her.
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:21.020]  Millie, Millie Weaver, known her eight years, she's been reporting for us off and on as a contractor for eight years, never gotten in trouble.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:23.020]  They want her banned.
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:27.020]  Harrison Smith does his own reports for him for worse, was up there pre-banned.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:31.020]  And of course, Paul Joseph Watson, he's had that YouTube channel eight years.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:38.020]  Eight years, never violates all their rules, any of it. They want him gone because they're copycats of me.
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:48.020]  Now, it's not just Ban Alex Jones, it's Ban anyone that sounds like him, anybody that doesn't want all the state championships retract to be won by men running against women,
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:58.020]  anybody that doesn't want war with Iran, anybody that's worried about 5G or glyphosate or GMOs or vaccine dangers and liability protection or secret government experimentation,
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:04.020]  or anybody that's worried about collapsing borders or anybody worried about not having jobs and the rust belt.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:09.020]  You know, all the really evil stuff I talk about. What a comedy of Erich.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:28.020]  That's precisely what everyone is now facing, that is part of the independent free press, free speech, free America, free thought experiment.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:34.020]  It's been going on for 200 years now that big tech is taking collusive control with big media to go after people.
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:37.020]  That was part of what congressional hearings were subject to yesterday.
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:49.020]  Congressman Dan Crenshaw sort of made famous because he has the patch over his eye, a veteran of our wars, contested Derrick Slater, the Google Global Director of Information Policy.
[01:54:49.020 --> 01:55:01.020]  It doesn't sound like an Orwellian name, something right out of 1984 or The Road to Wigan Pier or any of the great books or texts by Orwell who probably couldn't even forecast how crazy the modern world would get.
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:11.020]  Well, what Congressman Crenshaw documented and asked simple basic questions was how could Google name as Nazis people that are actually Jewish, religiously Jewish,
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:19.020]  and not only that, they have had victims of the Holocaust, people like Ben Shapiro, people like Dave Rubin, people like Jordan Peterson.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:25.020]  He goes, as he put it, two of these people are Jewish, very religious Jews, and you think they're Nazis.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:33.020]  It begs the question, what kind of education do people at Google have that they think religious Jews are Nazis?
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:42.020]  Many of them, as he noted, had family members killed in the Holocaust. Many of them had been targeted by anti-Semitic elements within the political spectrum.
[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:52.020]  Because how could, isn't it the case, as Congressman Crenshaw went on, that simply conservatives are being identified as Nazis for the purposes of censorship, for the purposes of shaming,
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:55.020]  and further for the purposes of promoting illicit violence.
[01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:06.020]  As noted on here, there's a punch of Nazi theme out there, so by identifying someone or calling someone a Nazi, you can effectively encourage and elicit physical violence against them,
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:13.020]  as has occurred routinely and repeatedly by members of Intifa. So this is what's happening in Big Tech, but it goes further.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:23.020]  Big Tech's, Google was exposed by Project Veritas, so how has Big Tech responded? They've colluded. Vimeo has now banned Project Veritas from their site.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:30.020]  Canada is now teaming up with Tech, and that's the Canadian government. Notice how this headline is written by Reuters.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:39.020]  It just says Canada, as if the whole country is getting together, says Canada teams up with Tech giants to counter extremist content online.
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:41.020]  Well, how do you define extremist?
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:55.020]  To give you an example of how vague and obscure that is, and that was one of the main points Congressman Crenshaw made to the Google executives and Google employees yesterday in front of the committee hearing, was these vague terms invite discriminatory application.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:57:11.020]  In the law, we call it void for vagueness doctrine, that when a law is so vague, it allows for disparate and discriminatory inferences and impact by politicians and political officials and executive officials who don't have any meaningful guidelines to go by.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:22.020]  What you get is these sort of broad scale, wide scale, broad brush censorship that takes place just by labeling something that sounds scary, sounds dangerous, sounds extremist.
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:27.020]  That's what Big Tech is doing, and that's why the White House is holding a social media summit next week and the week after.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:38.020]  When we get back, we'll discuss Big Tech's continuous censorship campaigns against independent press and independent speech, and we'll discuss the scandals that Democrats want to cover up at tonight's scandal, at tonight's debate,
[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:54.020]  and what those scandals are and how those scandals can be detailed, and we'll go into some of that detail when you come back on The Alex Jones Show. Guess those, Robert Barnes.
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:20.020]  I've begged for your support before, and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:28.020]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever. We have withstood so many of their attacks. We've gone through so much because of your support.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:38.020]  You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault. So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth.
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:58.020]  Now, at info wars.com, it's your fight. Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:17.020]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:46.020]  I keep fighting in the info war, and even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.020 --> 02:00:15.020]  Thank you sir for calling. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:28.020]  Robert Barnes here guest hosting the Alex Jones show, discussing the big tech censorship issues, discussing the Democratic debates, discussing the clown show that you can watch again tonight.
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:47.020]  Episode two, season two, series two, the sequel, when the big Democratic candidates get up on the debate stage, you can watch that at clownworld.us, which will be on tonight to broadcast again that you can review and see the unique clown show that is this particular Democratic nomination process.
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:01:01.020]  There's often what big tech and big media don't want you to see is the independent press, the independent stories that come from here. And to give you an example, as was recently commented on by one of the members of the media, it isn't just the social media companies.
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:15.020]  It's knitting companies. It's payment processing services. What we're seeing in real time is the ideological segregation of civil society in a bid to kick non quote unquote progressives out of the public square.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:29.020]  The consequences are monumental. And what are they talking about? They're talking about Project Veritas, YouTube banning the Pinterest investigation, Twitter suspending Veritas for its Pinterest story, Reddit banning Project Veritas.
[02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:39.020]  Yesterday, Reddit removed the Donald from being able to even comment on the Democratic debates. What do they use? The bogus allegation of threats that didn't really exist.
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:49.020]  The threats they were talking about had all been removed. There had been no violation of any policy by the Donald. And yet the Donald, one of the most popular meme makers on the entire Internet,
[02:01:49.020 --> 02:02:00.020]  one of the most popular commentators of viral insights on the Internet in terms of politics from the political right and the Trump supporting world was removed entirely from the very first Democratic debate.
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:20.020]  YouTube banning the Google investigation, Vimeo banning the Google investigation, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, refusing to even comment or discuss the Project Veritas expose that exposed Google and their corruption and their fraud that led to congressional hearings yesterday discussing it.
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:33.020]  That is what's taking place and it's not the limit of it. As the Intercept, a publication that comes from the left by Glenn Greenwald and others reported, a new site exposes how Apple censors apps in China.
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:48.020]  The new site is called AppleCensorship.com and it details how Apple is being integral in incorporating its tools and technology and its dominance over the application marketplace where that's where the Info Wars app was in various ways.
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:59.020]  They try to remove it, try to delist it, try to blacklist it. They're trying to do the same thing using the Chinese social credit and surveillance model system that they want to impose here in the United States.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:11.020]  But that's not the limit of it. As one article discusses in Wired, which is again a liberal publication, technology publication, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency betrays the company's true ambitions.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:22.020]  And what are they talking about? What they're talking about is whether Facebook is no longer a company, but is more like a country. In fact, they're describing it as creating an immersive ecosystem.
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:31.020]  So maybe it's time to start asking, what is the functional difference between a company and a country? And they talk about how much power they have over the global economy.
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:43.020]  How their ambition is to quote, own all your interactions, not just your driving, not just your eating, not just your typing, but all your thoughts, all your ideas, all your mentality, all your personality.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:47.020]  They would prefer that you forget they exist while they're watching everything you do.
[02:03:47.020 --> 02:04:00.020]  This is the big tech model that's meant ultimately to control thought and to suppress thought and to create a sort of mind conformity approach of the kind that gets the young Turks up and cheering outside the Democratic debate.
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:09.020]  And what is it all leading up to? Well, what is it all leading up to things like this? Twitter to censor Trump tweets ahead of the 2020 election.
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:17.020]  So after Project Veritas exposes this, today Twitter announced policies that they admitted would lead to down ranking President Trump's tweets.
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:31.020]  And the main forum, the main social media mechanism that the president has to reach out to ordinary everyday people to circumvent the mainstream media's gatekeeping collusive role with big tech to suppress independent news, independent views, and independent press.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:34.020]  They're going to try to achieve before the 2020 election.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:43.020]  When we get back, we'll discuss the scandals that the Democratic candidates are trying to hide, big media is trying to suppress, that big tech is trying to censor.
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:51.020]  And we'll discuss those in detail and whether they'll be asked about that tonight's debate or whether or not they will be hidden and suppressed like the ones last night were.
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:55.020]  So come back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:05:06.020]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:18.020]  The false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false. It's a smear. Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:25.020]  You don't even open it. It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you.
[02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:34.020]  This is Kafkaesque. This is bizarre. But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous.
[02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:40.020]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:50.020]  I wonder, where are the big boys? Where's the Wall Street Journal? Where's Associated Press? When are they going to report that they made a mistake? And what they said about you was inaccurate.
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:06:18.020]  We both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:30.020]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show being guest host to today by Attorney Robert Barnes. Stay with us as we discuss some of the Democratic scandals that were covered up last night and some of the Democratic scandals that they should be discussing tonight.
[02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:48.020]  So for example, you saw both Cory Booker and others discuss trying to break up Wall Street companies, trying to do something about big drug company prices and big pharma. Though notably many of them did not discuss big pharma's role involved in school shootings and whether or not drug companies use of SSRI drugs,
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:07:02.020]  special selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that the effect they have on young minds that have been sufficiently untested and lead people to commit violent acts, that was not discussed at all at the Democratic debate.
[02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:12.020]  Instead, it was blame the gun. Whatever you do, blame the gun, blame the tool, blame the mechanism, blame the means. Don't blame the motive, don't blame the method, don't blame other means of defense, only blame the gun.
[02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:25.020]  And in that context, we have Senator Klobacher from Minnesota who was mostly a nervous Nellie all night and then the nervous in the way in which she discussed things. She was half shaking up there. How is that going to be someone that's going to be elected president?
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:38.020]  I mean, I'm sure if President Trump was watching that, he gained confidence from watching the weakness of the Democratic candidates last night, not only in substantive content but in stylistic approach and their lack of persuasive quality and their lack of strong backbone character.
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:57.020]  Everyone except Tulsi Gabbard demonstrated that in spades. But let's go to video 11, which has Senator Klobacher, while mostly trying to dodge the question and mislead, try to give people the impression that taking away your guns is really taking away your second amendment rights, the rights that secure every other right in the Constitution,
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:08:05.020]  that somehow that's really not taking away your guns and is really a voluntary act. So if we can show video number 11.
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:17.020]  Give 30 seconds, Senator Klobacher, the Iron Range, I'm curious, gun confiscation, right? If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:29.020]  Well, that's not confiscation. You would give them the offer to buy back their gun. But I'll say this, I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his gear stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state?
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:40.020]  These proposals don't do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapon ban. When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed.
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:54.020]  And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started a literally a national shift. You know why? It's just like with gay marriage. When kids talk to their parents and their grandparents, they say, I don't understand why we can't put these sensible things in place.
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:09:02.020]  They say, listen, and if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds, it's the best thing that ever happened.
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:13.020]  You know, the reason why people don't like lawyers, they use language that isn't real, that isn't true, that isn't honest too frequently. And there you had Senator Klobacher saying that taking away your gun isn't confiscation.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:27.020]  That taking away your gun is taking away your means of self defense, taking away your means of enjoyment is not somehow a bad thing. It's not confiscatory. It's not taking anything. It's simply a voluntary act.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:32.020]  And it's that same mindset mentality. And what's interesting is there, she brought up various school shootings that occurred.
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:40.020]  What she did not discuss in terms of Sandy Hook was mechanisms and methods that could have been used to secure those schools. That was part of what the press covered up.
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:53.020]  While the press was busy blaming the gun, they weren't talking about Big Pharma. While the press was busy blaming the gun, they weren't talking about mental health facilities in the United States and their failure to serve underserved communities and constituencies, including the young.
[02:09:53.020 --> 02:10:08.020]  While they were talking solely and wholly about the gun, they were trying to suppress their Freedom of Information Act request, information about what the politicians had been up to in the local community, including failing to use elementary and elemental mechanisms and methods to secure the school,
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:20.020]  simply providing the means by which people could lock the teachers could lock the inside of their doors in order to protect themselves against this particular incident, something that has been custom in practice since other the horrific shootings that come about.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:26.020]  We won't know whether people could have been alive that are now passed away and now died after that horrific incident.
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:45.020]  What we do know is that the politicians got away with it because they were not exposed at the time and had they been exposed at the time, you would have probably had every school in the country at least employ the basic safety tactic of allowing teachers to at least be able to lock the inside of their classroom
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:49.020]  doors to protect young children when there's a shooter on the loose.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:59.020]  Now, of course, Israel and other countries have used the mechanism of being able to at least voluntarily, truly voluntarily, arm their teachers or have more armed guards present.
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:04.020]  You don't see these kind of mass shootings take place in places where you see armed security.
[02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:12.020]  You disproportionately see these mass shootings take place in places where gun ownership is often not allowed in that particular area or vicinity.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:20.020]  And in fact, there is an inadequate security mechanism put in place and that's what needs to be talked about and discussed, but unfortunately was not last night.
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:28.020]  But it's part of a broader pattern of what was not discussed last night and that included the many democratic scandals that have not been discussed or reviewed.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:37.020]  So for example, you had Senator Booker last night and you're going to have Senator Harris and Senator Gillibrand tonight, likely talking about how they want to break up Wall Street.
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:42.020]  They want to do something about the Wall Street dominance.
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:48.020]  But in these Times reports, the 2020 candidates are the darlings of Wall Street and the numbers are the proof.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:55.020]  And it goes through how Senator Booker, by far the candidate most favored by the big Wall Street firms is Cory Booker.
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:58.020]  He's known for his Wall Street friendly reputation.
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.020]  And yet, what was he doing last night?
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:10.020]  He was talking about how he's going to take on Wall Street, about as credible as Barack Obama, who was single-handedly was the biggest recipient of Wall Street funds in American political history.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:15.020]  In fact, the private equity world was more generous to Senator Booker than anyone else.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:18.020]  They've shown a, quote, particular affinity for Senator Booker.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:23.020]  But that's not all you all are going to have tonight, Senator Kamala Harris from the state of California.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:38.020]  We'll have up later an interview that was done at the scene by Infowars reporters of the Lieutenant Governor from California, who discussed for about seven or eight minutes how she would like the Democratic Party and the White House to be converted into a macro version of what California is at a micro version.
[02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:44.020]  So you can look forward to Skid Rose coming to your cities and streets soon if that vision becomes reality.
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:56.020]  But the other thing that Senator Booker was known for along with Senator Harris in California is that Senator Harris receives more funding from Wells Fargo than any presidential candidate in the country.
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:13:13.020]  And that shouldn't come as any surprise, even though Wells Fargo has been demonstrated repeatedly in various court cases and court filings as one of the most rogue banks that took a lot of money that did not belong to them over the many years and participated and facilitated the 2008 crash.
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:23.020]  But that wasn't the only aspects of the issues that linger, the conspiracy, the scandals that the press has used so far to suppress.
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:33.020]  Let's take one of the Democratic favorites, one of President Obama's favorites, the mayor from South Bend who will be on the stage tonight, Pete Buttigieg.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:40.020]  There's actually over under odds on whether or not you can pronunciate his name correctly. I'll confess I'll probably get it wrong at some point.
[02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:54.020]  But one of the things that's been covered up so far is about his role in racist firings of an African-American police chief, his attempts to fire that police chief while he was under FBI, while there was an FBI investigation of the local police department,
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:14:08.020]  while there was a prosecutorial investigation of the local police department. Apparently these secret tapes document conversations and communications that reveal various forms of racial prejudice by people politically connected to the mayor of South Bend, Mr. Buttigieg.
[02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:23.020]  There's been a history of police misconduct issues and allegations, those same allegations haunt Senator Harris who was involved with the crime lab when she was San Francisco district attorney that covered aspects up of misconduct and malfeasance and misdeeds.
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:31.020]  She covered up police misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct, government agent misconduct, repeatedly put people in prison who did not belong there.
[02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:37.020]  So are they going to ask these questions of Mr. Buttigieg tonight? Are they going to ask these questions of Senator Harris tonight?
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:45.020]  So particularly someone who's holding himself out as the winner of the oppression Olympics.
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:59.020]  The additional discussion will be whether or not they discussed Senator Harris and her involvement with Senator Feinstein, her involvement with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Lenard-tainted scandal involving the Hunter Point shipyard.
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:08.020]  This involves that there's sealed indictments involving the case in the matter. It's a superfund site at the Hunter Point shipyard.
[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:16.020]  And it involves cover-up of radium commodities underneath public housing. It involves many contaminated families because of what was taking place.
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:24.020]  And shock, shock, it turns out Senator Feinstein's husband Richard Blum was a primary contact to build condos at Treasure Island.
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:30.020]  Speaker Pelosi's nephew is an executive at Lenard that's involved in the construction project.
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:37.020]  And there's been, quote, continued silence by Senator Harris on, quote, the massive U.S. fraud that has occurred according to members of the press.
[02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:45.020]  Will the press discuss this tonight with Senator Harris, her role in corruption in the state of California, her role in covering up police misconduct?
[02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:54.020]  Pete Buttigieg's role in covering misconduct and malfeasance to the police and the prosecution units in South Bend. Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:21.020]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:33.020]  Not a security IPO or note. Blockchain data centers have approved a turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[02:16:48.020 --> 02:16:54.020]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an operating document.
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:17:06.020]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:15.020]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:20.020]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:32.020]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:40.020]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:44.020]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.

[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:20.020]  The worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:27.020]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart and I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[02:18:27.020 --> 02:18:35.020]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:41.020]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important. The enemy could win.
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:47.020]  We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God. This is Providence.
[02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:51.020]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.

[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:36.020]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:41.020]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, guest hosted by myself, Robert Barnes, today on behalf of Alex.
[02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:52.020]  Be on tonight for the ClownWorld.us. ClownWorld.us to cover the sequel, the second in the series of Clown World debates tonight for the Democratic candidates.
[02:20:52.020 --> 02:21:01.020]  And the big question is whether or not any of the media will be willing to ask a single question about the scandals and controversies that haunt these candidates.
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:12.020]  Last night, actually the Californication of the Democratic Party in the United States that they would like to seek was exposed and discussed by InfoWars reporters who were there on the ground.
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:24.020]  And let's go to that video where there's an extended interview with how she wants to Californify and Californicate the United States permanently by getting a Democratic candidate like Kamala Harris elected to the White House.
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:43.020]  I'm with action for the media. It's a local station out of Austin, Texas. I'm here today to ask people how the debates went. Is anyone stood out for them?
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:55.020]  Well, we have Senator Harris up there. We're going to hear a little bit more about how we're doing things in California. But by and large, my feeling was we got a lot of really great, qualified Democrats.
[02:21:55.020 --> 02:22:07.020]  And one of which would do a better job than the current occupant of the White House. And there was a lot of agreement between them about some of the big issues like immigration and healthcare and gun control.
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:13.020]  And then some differences between them. But all in all, it made me really proud to be Democrat.
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:17.020]  And what issues do you think are going to be at the forefront of the debate tomorrow?
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:26.020]  Well, I think they're going to be the same issues. But again, I think you're going to hear a little bit different approach, certainly from our California senator.
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:36.020]  But I think these are really the issues that by and large people are hearing about on the campaign trail and that voters want to hear the various candidates address.
[02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:42.020]  So you said that you wanted to bring the Democratic values of California to the rest of America. What were some of those values for you?
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:56.020]  Well, first of all, the reality is that California's are 27% foreign-born. We are truly a state of immigrants. And we are the fifth largest economy in the world.
[02:22:56.020 --> 02:23:05.020]  And there is a connection between immigration area, opportunity, public higher education, and a strong economy. So I think we're going to care about that.
[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:13.020]  I also think if you're going to hear a little bit from our senator about some of the issues related to gun control that were taken in California,
[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:18.020]  they asked how do you take whatever the number was, hundreds of millions of weapons off the street.
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:24.020]  In California, we're doing background checks on every issue. So we've got some creative solutions.
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:29.020]  And I think that those will hopefully take center stage tomorrow with Senator Harris.
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:36.020]  As Lieutenant Governor of California, is there anyone who should have endorsed yet officially? Yes, of course, I've endorsed my senator.
[02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:48.020]  But I will also say that I'm very much a believer that as Democrats across the country really start to pull back the layers and examine their choices,
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:57.020]  that we need to stay positive, that we need to decide who we're for and help our candidates deliver their message and help voters decide.
[02:23:57.020 --> 02:24:02.020]  Is there anyone you think that has a chance to defeat Trump in 2020?
[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:11.020]  Anyone who is the Democratic nominee is going to have the full force of the Democratic Party and people who believe in American democracy behind that.
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:20.020]  I strongly believe that. And I am really very confident that our party is going to come together behind our nominee.
[02:24:20.020 --> 02:24:29.020]  What do you think about the crisis right now in California? We have homeless people, we've got crisis outbreaks. What's going on with that?
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:36.020]  Look, California, like any state, has our challenges. We are a state of 40 million people.
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:45.020]  We have a homeless crisis, a portability crisis that sadly, but has come along with our economic growth.
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:52.020]  But we also have people in Sacramento and our legislature and the governor and the Democratic governor.
[02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:57.020]  We've worked together collaboratively, collaboratively, lots of different Indians.
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:03.020]  But at the same time, you don't have the kind of winner-take-all politics that you see in Washington.
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:07.020]  So I'm very optimistic that our state will address some of the challenges.
[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:14.020]  What do you have to say to some people that criticize the Democratic Party saying that a lot of blue cities have homeless problems?
[02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:20.020]  Homelessness is a problem in California. Homelessness is a problem across the country.
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:23.020]  A lot of that has to do with mental health issues.
[02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:29.020]  And we are finding new ways to try to address the problem.
[02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:33.020]  And one of the biggest in California is we just have to build one house and move it.
[02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:38.020]  So that is very much a form of our policy agenda right now.
[02:25:38.020 --> 02:25:45.020]  Open borders and illegal immigration are again at the forefront of those.
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:51.020]  What do you think, in all areas of the United States, what do you think it should bring to the table?
[02:25:51.020 --> 02:25:57.020]  Well, first of all, what she's going to bring to the table is compassion and the fact that we have to deal with this challenge
[02:25:57.020 --> 02:26:04.020]  in humanitarian crisis that we cannot forget in America is a nation of immigrants that is who we are
[02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:13.020]  and starting from basic compassion and not a place that has driven him and his white house
[02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:20.020]  to pursue policies that really are inhumane, tearing children apart and away from their families.
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:22.020]  It's just absolutely unacceptable.
[02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:29.020]  At the same time, what we're really grappling with here is now decades of inaction
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:36.020]  when it comes down to some really basic immigration form that is absolutely necessary
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:39.020]  to be able to adequately address the problem.
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:43.020]  Do you think that open borders are the solution to this problem?
[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:48.020]  The United States has never had open borders, and I didn't hear anyone up on the stage tonight
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:50.020]  asking for open borders.
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:59.020]  That's, of course, framing of this issue that Franklin Fox put out saying Donald Trump is building a wall
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.020]  and Democrats are open borders.
[02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:03.020]  That's just not true.
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:09.020]  What Democrats have been for for a very long time is comprehensive immigration reform, and it's complex.
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:12.020]  It's difficult and requires a bipartisan approach.
[02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:17.020]  Republicans are not willing to come to the table because they find this issue
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:22.020]  because it's under the skin of their people so they don't want to solve it.
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:27.020]  So will the natural and Elizabeth Warren want to repeal Section 1325
[02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:30.020]  to basically normalize open borders?
[02:27:30.020 --> 02:27:31.020]  No.
[02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:33.020]  What do you think about that?
[02:27:33.020 --> 02:27:40.020]  Well, so that's a nuance within what is necessary in comprehensive immigration reform
[02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:44.020]  and a question of whether or not it should be criminal offense across the border
[02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:46.020]  or a civil offense across the border.
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:53.020]  There is one small piece of a much larger conversation that needs to be had in a bipartisan way
[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:59.020]  and the Republicans have got to stop turning this into a weapon to divide our people
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:03.020]  and come together around comprehensive immigration reform.
[02:28:03.020 --> 02:28:07.020]  We have many immigrants who come into this country legally every year,
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:12.020]  and that is the vast majority of them, and it is a point of pride of our nation
[02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:15.020]  and should not be used as a weapon to return us against each other.
[02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:19.020]  What do you think about the photos of children and students that have been separated?
[02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:28.020]  Well, again, you know, so they agree that these kinds of policies that the Trump administration has pursued
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:32.020]  like the kinds of images that we've seen in children,
[02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:36.020]  of course, taken away from their parents, put into pages.
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:44.020]  What upsets me so much about it is that they are not trying to pursue a rational conversation.
[02:28:44.020 --> 02:28:50.020]  They are trying to drive people to one corner or another if it's not serving our country well.
[02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:51.020]  All right.
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:52.020]  Nice to meet you.
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:53.020]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:54.020]  I really appreciate it.

[02:30:54.020 --> 02:31:23.020]  We're not going to back down.
[02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:43.020]  We're not going to back down.
[02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:56.020]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us.
[02:31:56.020 --> 02:32:14.020]  Announcing the greatest show on earth, reparations, free health care, free college, free homes, free money forever.
[02:32:14.020 --> 02:32:42.020]  Let's meet the candidates.
[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:48.020]  The greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[02:32:48.020 --> 02:32:59.020]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7pm at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:21.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:31.020]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:34.020]  Robert Barnes back guest hosting the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:46.020]  Glad you can be here with us and hope you stick with us as we go through and discuss some of the scandals that the media is trying to cover up of the Democratic candidates past and history as well as the big tech censorship that takes place.
[02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:50.020]  We're also going to get to the questions that should be asked of Robert Mueller.
[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:54.020]  Robert Mueller has agreed now to appear before the Democratic Congress.
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:34:13.020]  Even though he said he wasn't going to be appearing, wasn't going to be discussing, wasn't going to be talking, wasn't going to be saying anything outside of the original report that he produced, a report that was riddled with legally dubious conclusions but did have one correct conclusion, no conspiracy, no collusion, no crime by President Trump.
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:20.020]  The questions that should be asked of Robert Mueller will get into in the later on in the show in the next segment.
[02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:36.020]  And we'll discuss the questions that need to be asked so that Robert Mueller is no longer inspired to defame or libel the president of the United States with false innuendo like he did in his press conference and like he did with two years of a bogus investigation based on a fraudulent conspiracy theory that had no merit in fact
[02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:52.020]  that brought us to the brink of nuclear war as these largest nuclear power other than the United States and the world is Russia and also almost brought us the overturning of an election and the Democratic processes that put President Trump in the presidency.
[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:54.020]  But we'll discuss that next.
[02:34:54.020 --> 02:35:04.020]  Before we go into further detail there, let's discuss the scandals of the questions that should be asked tonight in the Democratic debates, questions that were not asked last night but hopefully will be asked tonight.
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:08.020]  If not by those inside the debate room, be asked by those outside of the public.
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:17.020]  Remember you can watch Clown World at clownworld.us tonight and Alex's breakdown of the continuing unintended comedy show that is the Democratic debates.
[02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:32.020]  The various collusion and conspiracies that occur in these debates are related to the attempts to cover up for the Democratic candidates history of their own collusion, their own criminal conduct, their own various scandals that they have been a part of that have never been fully investigated or vetted
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:35.020]  in the sort of Hillary Clinton tradition.
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:37.020]  One of those is Senator Kamala Harris.
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:52.020]  You just saw a video excerpt of the Lieutenant Governor of California who was interviewed by the Info Wars reporters there on the ground who talked about how anxious she was to California-fi and California-kate the United States into the way California is today.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:55.020]  Didn't really have answers on the immigration issues.
[02:35:55.020 --> 02:36:04.020]  Didn't really have answers on the skid row homelessness problems that are occurring. Didn't really have issues on the mental health crisis that's occurring amongst those that are in the homeless community and constituency.
[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:17.020]  Didn't really have answers on the wage threats and the wage push downs and other issues that are raised by illegal immigration into the United States as well as the disease questions that come from people who come into the country who have not been checked or vetted or looked at.
[02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:30.020]  The other issues that she also didn't talk about, notice she went on about how she wanted to make sure everything stayed positive and she said this right after talking about how she had endorsed Kamala Harris, Senator Kamala Harris from California for the presidency.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:34.020]  Now what would inspire that statement in relationship to the debates tonight?
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:40.020]  It's probably because she doesn't want anyone to be discussing Kamala Harris's questionable political past.
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:49.020]  This includes an article from the Wall Street Journal that said Kamala Harris didn't act for five years on a policy to help ensure fair trials.
[02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:59.020]  This included a continuous failure to disclose past misconduct by police and prosecutors involved in the law enforcement cases that she was responsible for.
[02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:16.020]  This also deals with how Kamala Harris got to the position she's in today as former Mayor Willie Brown, who has been under FBI and other criminal investigation over the years during his political career, publicly admitted and is documented in a Fox News story and he publicly admitted in his own column.
[02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:29.020]  He had, in this era of me too, Kamala Harris got fame, got connections, got credit, got political power, got to the position of prominent she has today because she was Willie Brown's mistress.
[02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:37.020]  She engaged in an affair with this older man who he admitted, quote, he influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions.
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:52.020]  She certainly helped with her first race for office that put her on the political stage and the political map in the first place and it goes into the details in the ways that he promoted her to highly paid, well-paid positions that lined her pockets and put her in a position of political power and prominence.
[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:58.020]  So how is it that in the me too era someone like that is going to be nominated for the Democratic nomination for the presidency?
[02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:05.020]  Will that question be asked tonight in the Democratic debates by the supposedly independent media that will be asking questions?
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:17.020]  As the local newspapers in San Luis Obispo and other parts of California talk about, Kamala Harris's past could hurt her run for presidency and what do they mean by that?
[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:29.020]  They mean the fact that she secretly paid $400,000 to settle harassment claims against one of her top aides who she continued to promote despite knowing of these allegations and accusations.
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:39.020]  So in this me too era you have someone who was a politician's mistress who obtained well-paid, well-compensated positions while and after she was that person's mistress.
[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:55.020]  And then in turn promoted people within her own staff who were busy harassing people so badly that she had to pay out $400,000 to settle the claims against one of her top aides and yet continued to promote them even until media coverage exposed her.
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:05.020]  In addition her district attorney's office was caught violating the constitutional rights of individuals repeatedly with various forms of misconduct and malfeasance and misdeeds.
[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:13.020]  She quote systematically mishandled evidence. That was according to another liberal judge in San Francisco said that about Kamala Harris.
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:19.020]  She often pushed harsh punishments of people who did very minor events and minor incidents.
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:35.020]  She repeatedly upheld knowingly wrongful convictions of innocent individuals, convictions obtained by official misconduct, by government misconduct, by suppression of crucial information by her prosecutors in her own office that went right to the top according to the California courts.
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:48.020]  Will any of the press cover that tonight in the Democratic debate? Will they ask her a single question about it or will they like what they did with Cory Booker where they asked the man from Wall Street, the man from Big Pharma to talk about how he was going to take on Wall Street and Big Pharma.
[02:39:48.020 --> 02:40:01.020]  Will they ask Kamala Harris how she is going to clean up the criminal justice system even though she was part of corrupting that system in the first place over a decade of a political experience as the attorney general in the district attorney in California.
[02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:07.020]  But that isn't the only political scandals that should be dominating the Democratic debate in the discussion and the questions tonight.
[02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:14.020]  The big one include Sleepy Creepy Joker Joe and those include his connections to China and Ukraine.
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:22.020]  For example, as reported by major publications, including the Government Accountability Institute, Peter Schweitzer, he was the author of Clinton Cash.
[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:41.020]  He also wrote a book called Secret Empires in which he documented how Biden's family, particularly his son Hunter Biden, entered into, quote, lucrative business arrangements with Chinese government-tied investment funds and a struggling Ukrainian energy company that led to millions and billions of dollars being exchanged.
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:52.020]  It was, quote, part of a coveted $1.5 billion private equity deal, one of the biggest deals of that kind undertaken in China or in the same with the Ukraine deal.
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:55.020]  What's interesting is what other involvement it involved.
[02:40:55.020 --> 02:41:06.020]  One investment was into a company that was a facial recognition software provider that raised eyebrows as Human Rights Group claimed it was being used to, quote, prop up China's surveillance state.
[02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:18.020]  So you have not only involvement of corruption and collusion that, wow, Joe Biden was the vice president of the United States, his son was getting deals that he had never got before and that were completely unexplained by his lack of skill set.
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:26.020]  As this article is in the New York Post, authored by Peter Schweitzer, details, the troubling reason why Biden is so soft on China.
[02:41:26.020 --> 02:41:28.020]  Will this question be asked tonight?
[02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:36.020]  They discuss and disclose how the businesses of Hunter Biden and his partners, quote, created a series of LLCs.
[02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:40.020]  Those are called limited liability companies, often used to disguise ownership and authorship.
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:47.020]  We're involved in, quote, multi-billion dollar private equity deals with companies owned by the Chinese government.
[02:41:47.020 --> 02:41:54.020]  Not only that, some of the deals included a son of former Massachusetts State Senator Billy Bulger.
[02:41:54.020 --> 02:42:07.020]  You might wonder who that is, but that relates to the famous Whitey Bulger, the notorious mobster who was covered up by Robert Mueller and others while he was a secret informant and popularly portrayed in the movie The Departed by Jack Nicholson,
[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:10.020]  and one of the biggest corruption scandals to ever hit the FBI.
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:17.020]  So somehow the Bulger family is connected, involved with the Biden family, with making money in China and the Ukraine.
[02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:27.020]  It goes further in this 12 days after Hunter stepped off Air Force Two in Beijing. That's when his company signed a, quote, historic deal with the Bank of China.
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:35.020]  The U.S. Justice Department would later charge companies involved with this, with stealing nuclear secrets from the United States.
[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:46.020]  So when we come back, let's discuss whether or not Biden has been involved while he was Vice President in allowing nuclear secrets to be stolen from the United States on behalf of companies connected to and involved
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:52.020]  with enriching his family and secret deals only obtained right after he stepped off Air Force Two.
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:43:17.020]  Up next, come back.
[02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:33.020]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever. We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:39.020]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed.
[02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:42.020]  They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:54.020]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at infowarkshore.com. It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want Info Wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:25.020]  of this public reach. It is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:30.020]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting Info Wars.
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:39.020]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:47.020]  and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:54.020]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:07.020]  Big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:15.020]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this
[02:45:15.020 --> 02:45:22.020]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs,
[02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:30.020]  the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:41.020]  The Info Wars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:48.020]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[02:45:48.020 --> 02:45:51.020]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:56.020]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[02:45:56.020 --> 02:46:03.020]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:12.020]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:46:12.020 --> 02:46:29.020]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup. A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:46:29.020 --> 02:46:40.020]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars. So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:29.020]  Robert Barnes on the Alex Jones Show guest hosting today. Just enjoying some of the Info Wars coffee that you just heard advertised about.
[02:47:29.020 --> 02:47:36.020]  It's one of the best. It's in Twin Peaks. There was a line in the old TV show some years ago where he sat down.
[02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:43.020]  And one of the reasons why he stayed involved in the investigation, the particular FBI agent, was because they had done good coffee in Twin Peaks.
[02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:53.020]  And Info Wars coffee is truly done good coffee. Extended into 50% off all Info Wars life formulas all the way through July 4th.

[02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:13.020]  Because you are the firewall between the independent free press and independent free speech and independent free elections and independent free thought in this country.
[02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:22.020]  And the big tech, big media collusive conspiracies that attempt to suppress and oppress that speech and thought and elections in this country.
[02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:35.020]  When you have Project Veritas document in detail, people admitting, confessing, blowing the whistle on Google and big tech, the most powerful the big tech company is involved, intending to meddle in the 2020 elections.
[02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:41.020]  The only counterpoint to that is that you seize that power back by supporting Info Wars.
[02:48:41.020 --> 02:48:52.020]  By what you're doing is beyond you're buying products that you like, you buy products that you enjoy. All Alex has done over the years is looked at products he likes, that he enjoys, finds the best ones and gives them to his audience.
[02:48:52.020 --> 02:49:02.020]  And in exchange, the audience allows Info Wars to be a meaningful, independent, the most meaningful of its scale, of its space and the independent free press.
[02:49:02.020 --> 02:49:19.020]  There's a reason why there's been such an effort to oppress and suppress Info Wars and the social media sphere and the public media sphere. So many efforts to lie and libel about Alex Jones and Info Wars to try to defame and destroy the Info Wars message, the Info Wars brand, the Info Wars voice.
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:30.020]  Because that voice is really the voice of the audience. Because you have seized back the power from the big corporate donors and the sugar daddy billionaires who control almost every other major media outlet in the world.
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:41.020]  So continue to support Info Wars by using the opportunity of the sales that will continue through this weekend to use them, especially coming up to July 4th when we're going to be celebrating our independence.
[02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:49.020]  We're going to be celebrating not only the independence of a nation, but the independence of an idea. The idea of freedom of thought was unique to the American Revolution.
[02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:56.020]  It really didn't meaningfully exist in any legal form prior to the United States Constitution in the United States political experiment.
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:50:08.020]  Free thought, free speech really didn't exist prior to that. Freedom of religion didn't really exist prior to that. Free elections in a little de-democratic process didn't really exist prior to that.
[02:50:08.020 --> 02:50:23.020]  Before then you had royal families and political dynasties controlling our electoral, political and economic and futures. You had institutions, big religious institutions or other social institutions controlling what you could think, controlling what you could speak, controlling what you could hear.
[02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:33.020]  Info Wars is the ultimate counter to that. So as we come to the July 4th revolution that reignited the ideas of freedom around the world, help continue to support, it is your choice.
[02:50:33.020 --> 02:50:44.020]  It is your empowerment, self-empowerment that makes possible the freedom of speech, the freedom of thought, the freedom of press that Info Wars is able to protect, defend and articulate.
[02:50:44.020 --> 02:51:00.020]  And that's particularly going to be revealed tonight when you can watch the clownworld.us debate right here on clownworld.us where you'll be able to see the discussion and the dialogue that takes place and see whether they ask the questions that needed to be asked that are likely not going to be asked.
[02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:05.020]  And that's why we need this free press. That's why we need this free thought. That's why we need this free speech.
[02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:19.020]  For example, when we go back to Senator, well, Senator and then Vice President Biden, while he was Vice President, special deals were cut, billion dollar deals, deals that put millions of dollars in the pockets of Biden family and friends.
[02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:28.020]  But it went beyond that. As reported in the New York Post, troublingly, some of these investments had major implications for national security.
[02:51:28.020 --> 02:51:46.020]  In December 2014, one of the companies involved in some of these projects became an anchor investor in the IPO, the initial public offering, of China General Nuclear Power Corporation, a state-owned energy company involved in the construction of nuclear reactors.
[02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:58.020]  And here's the scary part. In April 2016, the U.S. Justice Department would charge China General Nuclear Power Corporation with stealing nuclear secrets from the United States.
[02:51:58.020 --> 02:52:03.020]  Action federal prosecutors admitted could cause significant damage to our national security.
[02:52:03.020 --> 02:52:13.020]  So what was Vice President Biden and his family doing cutting deals with businesses and companies that were busy stealing nuclear secrets from the United States?
[02:52:13.020 --> 02:52:17.020]  Well, that question be asked tonight at the Democratic debates.
[02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:26.020]  Not only that, will they ask about the Ukrainian nightmare, as described in the Hill.com by the excellent investigative reporter John Solomon.
[02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:34.020]  As the headline reveals, Joe Biden's 2020 Ukrainian nightmare, a closed probe, is revived.
[02:52:34.020 --> 02:52:45.020]  What are they referencing? They're referencing a probe that was taking place in Ukraine that Joe Biden, while he was Vice President, managed to get suppressed because he managed to get the prosecutor fired.
[02:52:45.020 --> 02:53:00.020]  And they were, quote, the prosecutor Biden got fired, was leading a wide-ranging corruption probe in Ukraine into the natural gas firm that employed, guess who, Biden's younger son Hunter as a board member.
[02:53:00.020 --> 02:53:10.020]  In fact, some of these companies and banking records reveal Biden was receiving as much as $166,000 a month connected to these transactions.
[02:53:10.020 --> 02:53:21.020]  But it gets even worse as they go into detail in Peter Schweitzer's book on secret empires, the various money that changed hands, when it changed hands, how investigations disappeared,
[02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:28.020]  and how Vice President Biden even bragged about the ability to get these allegations suppressed and the prosecutor fired.
[02:53:28.020 --> 02:53:33.020]  Is Biden going to be asked that question tonight in the Democratic debates?
[02:53:33.020 --> 02:53:39.020]  As we go on, will they be asking about the quote Joe Biden's haunted legacy in Iraq?
[02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:47.020]  Because it keeps going and going when it comes to Biden. The only thing worse than his continuous gaffes is his continued allegations of corruption.
[02:53:47.020 --> 02:53:57.020]  There's issues again about defense contractor issues, about Biden's support of some of these wars and conflict, about Biden's friends, pals, and political allies getting enriched.
[02:53:57.020 --> 02:54:09.020]  The other big issue tonight on the Democratic debate stage, other than whether they ask serious meaningful questions about the corruption histories of Pete Buttigieg or Joe Biden or Kamala Harris,
[02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:17.020]  is whether or not Joe Biden has one of his famous gaffes again. Whether he starts talking about if you go to a 7-Eleven store, you only find Pakistanis,
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:22.020]  whether he starts stereotyping African Americans as he's done repeatedly and routinely over his history,
[02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:30.020]  whether he tries to defend his segregation friends and allies and calls in the 1970s, whether or not he just has one of his gaffes,
[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:36.020]  such as one of his famous ones when he didn't realize that he was talking to someone, he said in the crowd in the audience,
[02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:40.020]  he said he really felt bad for their mom passing away and it turned out their mom was still alive.
[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:48.020]  Or when he kept asking a paraplegic, a person who was a paraplegic following a care accident to please quote, stand up.
[02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:58.020]  And whether he'll explain some of his racial theories like black awareness for his reasons for opposing busing,
[02:54:58.020 --> 02:55:02.020]  or whether he'll tell people again that the word jobs only has three letters in it.
[02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:09.020]  So everybody's really looking, it's like going to a NASCAR race and hoping, partially hoping, secretly hoping you kind of see a crash.
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:12.020]  You don't necessarily want anybody to die but you want to see a crash.
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:17.020]  Two-thirds of the people that are going to be watching Joe Biden tonight are really hoping he just has one big bad gaff.
[02:55:17.020 --> 02:55:24.020]  It would be perfect in Clown World for Joker Joe to make that the seminal event of these early Democratic debates.
[02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:31.020]  And in that capacity, let's go to video three because you still have an opportunity to purchase the Clown World t-shirt
[02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:37.020]  that is a signature iconic only available at Info Wars and let's show that video now.

[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:46.020]  what questions have been asked, what questions have been avoided, what questions have been ignored,
[02:56:46.020 --> 02:56:53.020]  whether Joe Biden, Joker Joe, Sleepy Creepy Joe in the Me Too era makes another gaffe of his famous infamous kinds.
[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:58.020]  Whether Kamala Harris has asked meaningful questions about her connections to corruption and investigations,
[02:56:58.020 --> 02:57:02.020]  including connections to Speaker Pelosi and Senator Feinstein.
[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:06.020]  Whether or not there's meaningful questions about the various war policies some of them have promulgated.
[02:57:06.020 --> 02:57:13.020]  Whether or not they're challenged on lies such as the cages that kids are facing involving illegal immigration.
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:16.020]  People generally are detained when they do something illegal.
[02:57:16.020 --> 02:57:21.020]  Whether or not there'll be meaningful questions about the fact that Barack Obama's idea has been publicly reported.
[02:57:21.020 --> 02:57:26.020]  Whether or not they're going to discuss the cartels making millions and billions of dollars off human smuggling.
[02:57:26.020 --> 02:57:30.020]  Whether they're going to discuss real questions, real controversies, and real paths.
[02:57:30.020 --> 02:57:35.020]  Tune in tonight for the clownworld.us debate, discussion of the Democratic debate,
[02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:39.020]  and whether the big media and big tech continue to collude and conspire against an independent free press.
[02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:44.020]  Thanks for joining the Alex Jones show. Continue to support InfoWars.com.
[02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:48.020]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:51.020]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:57.020]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.020 --> 02:58:06.020]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.020 --> 02:58:10.020]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:10.020 --> 02:58:14.020]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:20.020]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:25.020]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:34.020]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.020 --> 02:58:43.020]  We're going to keep fighting in the InfoWars. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:43.020 --> 02:58:52.020]  Thank you, sir, for calling InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:58:52.020 --> 02:58:58.020]  Yours and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:58:58.020 --> 02:59:06.020]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week,
[02:59:06.020 --> 02:59:10.020]  the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:15.020]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[02:59:15.020 --> 02:59:22.020]  And I want you to know that love is right back at you. And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support,
[02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:29.020]  because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win. And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun.
[02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:36.020]  But that's not what's important. The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[02:59:36.020 --> 02:59:41.020]  This is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[02:59:41.020 --> 03:00:07.020]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:27.020]  In 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:41.020]  Let's go back again. No Alex today, but you've got me for the hour.
[03:00:41.020 --> 03:00:51.020]  Okay, so it's me, Matt Bracken, and I'll be on for the hour. Later we'll be taking some phone calls, but there's a lot to talk about first.
[03:00:51.020 --> 03:01:02.020]  What can you add to the clown world debates? Got a little bit of a feedback thing going on here.
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:09.020]  Alright, clown world debates. Part one is in the can. Part two is coming up.
[03:01:09.020 --> 03:01:22.020]  And it's...
[03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:29.020]  Right now! I'm standing up against those that are destroying this country as we speak.
[03:01:29.020 --> 03:01:37.020]  And why am I fired up? Because this is war. Absolute, unabated, total war against our nation.
[03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:49.020]  We bring life. We bring death. We are men. We are women. We are the humans. We are the planet. We are God's creation. We are the future. Not you! Death! Death!
[03:01:49.020 --> 03:01:53.020]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:01:53.020 --> 03:01:55.020]  We don't share death.
[03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:59.020]  Defending the Republic from enemies, porn, and domestic.
[03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:28.020]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:35.020]  Info Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:02:35.020 --> 03:02:41.020]  Who is the geopolitical threat to the United States? Just give me one more to answer, Congressman Delaney.
[03:02:41.020 --> 03:02:42.020]  Can you repeat the question?
[03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:45.020]  Greatest geopolitical threat to the United States right now, Congressman Delaney.
[03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:52.020]  Well, the biggest geopolitical challenge is China, but the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons.
[03:02:52.020 --> 03:02:54.020]  So those are different questions.
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:56.020]  Totally get it. Go ahead, Governor Inslee.
[03:02:56.020 --> 03:03:00.020]  The greatest threat to the security of the United States is Donald Trump.
[03:03:00.020 --> 03:03:03.020]  Congresswoman Gabbard.
[03:03:03.020 --> 03:03:07.020]  The greatest geopolitical threat.
[03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:13.020]  The greatest threat that we face is the fact that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
[03:03:13.020 --> 03:03:16.020]  Two threats. Economic threat, China.
[03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:21.020]  But our major threat right now is what's going on in the Middle East with Iran if we don't get together.
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:26.020]  Try to keep it slimmer than what we've been going here. One or two words.
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:30.020]  Our existential threat is climate change. We have to confront it before it's too late.
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:33.020]  Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
[03:03:33.020 --> 03:03:35.020]  Secretary Castro.
[03:03:35.020 --> 03:03:37.020]  China and climate change.
[03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:39.020]  Congressman Ryan.
[03:03:39.020 --> 03:03:43.020]  China without a question, they're wiping us around the world economically.
[03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:45.020]  And Mr. Mayor.
[03:03:45.020 --> 03:03:50.020]  Russia because they're trying to undermine our democracy and they've been doing a pretty damn good job of it and we need to stop them.
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:54.020]  All right. Well, let me give 30 seconds.
[03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:56.020]  Senator Klobuchar.
[03:03:56.020 --> 03:03:58.020]  Iron range. I'm curious.
[03:03:58.020 --> 03:04:00.020]  Gun confiscation, right?
[03:04:00.020 --> 03:04:04.020]  If the government is buying back, how do you not have that conversation?
[03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:08.020]  Well, that's not confiscation. You would give them the offer to buy back their gun.
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:16.020]  But I'll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state?
[03:04:16.020 --> 03:04:21.020]  These proposals don't do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapon ban.
[03:04:21.020 --> 03:04:27.020]  When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed.
[03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:33.020]  And then now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started a literally a national shift.
[03:04:33.020 --> 03:04:41.020]  You know why? It's just like with gay marriage. When kids talk to their parents and their grandparents, they say, I don't understand why we can't put these sensible things in place.
[03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:46.020]  They listen and if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds, it's the best thing.
[03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:58.020]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[03:04:58.020 --> 03:05:06.020]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[03:05:06.020 --> 03:05:10.020]  That's not backed by some billionaire. That's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[03:05:10.020 --> 03:05:19.020]  It is completely independent of all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[03:05:19.020 --> 03:05:28.020]  That in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[03:05:28.020 --> 03:05:39.020]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:47.020]  And the Info Wars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[03:05:47.020 --> 03:06:13.020]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[03:06:17.020 --> 03:06:25.020]  Okay, this time I'm going to make it work. Working mistake on my part. Sorry about that at the top of the hour.
[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:35.020]  Well, there's a lot of news this week. I think I ran for the time being is on the back burner and people are thinking maybe it's just going to settle down and go away.
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:42.020]  But there's some news that I don't know if you would exactly say it's being suppressed, but it sure isn't being publicized.
[03:06:42.020 --> 03:06:52.020]  And earlier in June around June 11th, explosives were found in London like tons linked to Iran.
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:07:03.020]  But you have to almost search around for this news. And in the last couple of days, another half ton of demolitions linked to Iran was found in Paris, France.
[03:07:03.020 --> 03:07:07.020]  Folks, I don't need to tell you what this can do.
[03:07:07.020 --> 03:07:17.020]  If you're old enough to remember the troubles in northern Ireland, that low intensity civil war had been going on since the late 60s.
[03:07:17.020 --> 03:07:28.020]  And it ended when the IRA essentially forced the British government to the negotiating table by putting car bombs in downtown London.
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:36.020]  And what a car bomb does in a business district, never mind civilian casualties.
[03:07:36.020 --> 03:07:41.020]  It's a mega million dollar, nearly a billion dollar hit to a financial district.
[03:07:41.020 --> 03:07:46.020]  If you have a car bomb going off, say on the London equivalent of Wall Street.
[03:07:46.020 --> 03:07:52.020]  All those window walls, thousands of glass panels implode.
[03:07:52.020 --> 03:07:56.020]  The offices are unusable for days or weeks.
[03:07:56.020 --> 03:08:01.020]  So this is a huge financial hit aside from any civilian casualties.
[03:08:01.020 --> 03:08:07.020]  And my theory is, and this is going back to the Iran story.
[03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:17.020]  As long as the mullahs are negotiating directly with Trump, if Trump is the other player, power player, they lose because we don't need their oil.
[03:08:17.020 --> 03:08:21.020]  Essentially, we don't have to guard the Straits of Hormuz.
[03:08:21.020 --> 03:08:29.020]  If we want to step back from being the world's policemen and ensuring freedom of the seas, we can do so.
[03:08:29.020 --> 03:08:39.020]  If you ever played the game of risk, just owning North America puts you in a very strong position when the rest of the world is going at each other.
[03:08:39.020 --> 03:08:54.020]  So in order for the Iranian mullahs to put pressure on Trump to reopen negotiations to close, to end the sanctions or lift the sanctions which are choking Iran,
[03:08:54.020 --> 03:08:59.020]  the Iranians have to make a credible threat of closing the Straits of Hormuz.
[03:08:59.020 --> 03:09:11.020]  When they did it in the 80s by dropping sea mines right in the Persian Gulf, we wound up giving them a bloody lip and eye in Operation Praying Manus in 1988.
[03:09:11.020 --> 03:09:18.020]  What they learned from that is, if we go against the USA again, we're going to need better weapons and different weapons.
[03:09:18.020 --> 03:09:33.020]  That's where they've now invested in thousands of truck-launched anti-ship missiles that are arrayed for hundreds of miles in that arc around the Straits of Hormuz.
[03:09:33.020 --> 03:09:45.020]  If that doesn't work, and that's enough to bring the Western world to its knees, but if we go all out, if we attack Iran directly and this goes into a big war,
[03:09:45.020 --> 03:09:51.020]  the other big weapons they're going to have are these car bombs going off all over Western capitals.
[03:09:51.020 --> 03:10:05.020]  So if we have found tons of explosives in London and at least a half ton in Paris linked to Iran, the way that terror cells work is they're independent.
[03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:07.020]  They're not going to know about any other cells.
[03:10:07.020 --> 03:10:16.020]  If you found one cell, you can bet there's five or ten more that have not been discovered, that don't know of the existence of the other cells.
[03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:18.020]  That's the way it works.
[03:10:18.020 --> 03:10:27.020]  And if we get into a shooting match with Iran, they're not going to just be checkmated like they were with Operation Praying Manus,
[03:10:27.020 --> 03:10:33.020]  where they roll out the sea mines, we sink half their navy, and they're out of moves.
[03:10:33.020 --> 03:10:42.020]  If this happens again, they're going to be able to attack Israel and many Western capitals directly with ballistic missiles.
[03:10:42.020 --> 03:10:51.020]  Remember, Iran and Iraq already had the experience of a missile war, where for years they were launching scud missiles at each other's cities.
[03:10:51.020 --> 03:10:55.020]  So this is not like a new concept to the Iranians.
[03:10:55.020 --> 03:11:04.020]  What they learned from the 80s and the tanker war is next time, have better weapons and a lot of them.
[03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:06.020]  And that's why I think they shot down the drone.
[03:11:06.020 --> 03:11:16.020]  It was almost comparable to the Francis Gary Powers U-2 shootdown in, I think it was 1959 or 60,
[03:11:16.020 --> 03:11:24.020]  where we had been flying straight over the Soviet Union, confident that they had no missiles which could reach up and shoot down a U-2.
[03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:31.020]  As soon as they had that missile, they demonstrated that we were no longer able to just fly over the USSR.
[03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:37.020]  Now, whether our global hawk was over Iranian airspace or not is debatable.
[03:11:37.020 --> 03:11:47.020]  Certainly, it looks like the Iranians did recover big parts of that global hawk if the video is legit and it looks legit to me.
[03:11:47.020 --> 03:11:57.020]  So I wouldn't necessarily trust either government about whether it was in international waters or Iranian waters.
[03:11:57.020 --> 03:12:04.020]  And sometimes those are debatable because Iran might point to some little rock on the Persian Gulf and say,
[03:12:04.020 --> 03:12:12.020]  we draw the territorial limit around this little rock, which the Americans and the Saudis don't recognize as Iranian territory.
[03:12:12.020 --> 03:12:20.020]  So anytime you get into a who's territory, was it dispute, then you have to back up and say, okay, who's drawing the map?
[03:12:20.020 --> 03:12:28.020]  But in any event, we're now in our forces in the Middle East are in range of very heavy-duty Iranian weaponry.
[03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:38.020]  And not only that, it looks like they've got terror cells armed with pretty large quantities of explosives already in Western capitals.
[03:12:38.020 --> 03:12:44.020]  And never mind the fact that hundreds or thousands of civilians could be killed.
[03:12:44.020 --> 03:12:53.020]  Just setting off a bomb in a financial district is a multi-billion dollar hit because you can essentially shut down Wall Street.
[03:12:53.020 --> 03:12:55.020]  You don't need to fly an airplane into a building.
[03:12:55.020 --> 03:13:01.020]  Just putting off a car bomb between buildings knocks out all those window walls.
[03:13:01.020 --> 03:13:06.020]  That's what the side of a modern building is today, glass window walls.
[03:13:06.020 --> 03:13:12.020]  So we have got to really think seriously this time about attacking Iran.
[03:13:12.020 --> 03:13:16.020]  And I'm pretty glad that President Trump didn't go for the bait.
[03:13:16.020 --> 03:13:26.020]  I think that clearly that was what their intention was, was to cause us to ratchet up to doing a strike that would cause deaths, casualties,
[03:13:26.020 --> 03:13:36.020]  gain Iran, world sympathy, and then they go back and ratchet the next one, start firing some missiles at Saudi Arabia or other countries or American bases.
[03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:42.020]  So for now, I think that Trump has very wisely sidestepped that issue.
[03:13:42.020 --> 03:13:47.020]  The fact is, we are succeeding just with strangling them with economic sanctions.
[03:13:47.020 --> 03:13:59.020]  So there's really no need to cause hundreds of Iranian deaths over an unmanned global hawk, even if it is something like $150 million.
[03:13:59.020 --> 03:14:08.020]  Shame on us for sticking a $150 million platform into disputed territory where the Iranians could shoot it down.
[03:14:08.020 --> 03:14:13.020]  And supposedly we've attacked them with cyber warfare and retaliation.
[03:14:13.020 --> 03:14:20.020]  They claim it did nothing. Our side says that their surface to air missiles have been knocked out.
[03:14:20.020 --> 03:14:22.020]  Who knows the truth of that?
[03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:27.020]  All right, at least for now though, it looks like we're not going directly to war with Iran.
[03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:32.020]  But I want people to stop gloating and beating war drums.
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:39.020]  I heard Sean Hannity talking about how we can just whip Iran all from the air, no boots on the grounds.
[03:14:39.020 --> 03:14:44.020]  That's the whole purpose of them having these truck-based anti-ship missiles.
[03:14:44.020 --> 03:14:51.020]  To get rid of those things hidden in caves all over southern Iran, we would need to send boots on the ground,
[03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:56.020]  or they could just keep launching them for days, weeks, or months, closing the Straits of Hormuz.
[03:14:56.020 --> 03:15:04.020]  So folks need to really be aware of the very deep and involved chess match that's here.
[03:15:04.020 --> 03:15:12.020]  They learned from 1988, and I think we learned the wrong lessons that we can just slap Iran around anytime we want.
[03:15:12.020 --> 03:15:20.020]  I don't think that we can, not without them closing the Straits of Hormuz, which will wreck our western economies and Asian economies,
[03:15:20.020 --> 03:15:24.020]  as well as starting massive terror attacks in our capitals.
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:34.020]  Anyway, when we come back, I'm going to switch gears, and we're going to talk about social media censorship going into the 2020 elections.
[03:15:34.020 --> 03:15:39.020]  If you thought that the Russians buying Facebook ads was bad, what a joke.
[03:15:39.020 --> 03:15:44.020]  Just look at what Google and Facebook have been doing and are planning to do.
[03:15:44.020 --> 03:15:54.020]  Alright, we'll be back in a couple minutes with that.
[03:16:15.020 --> 03:16:19.020]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[03:16:19.020 --> 03:16:21.020]  Not a security IPO or note.
[03:16:21.020 --> 03:16:31.020]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[03:16:46.020 --> 03:16:52.020]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[03:16:52.020 --> 03:16:56.020]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:16:56.020 --> 03:17:01.020]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[03:17:22.020 --> 03:17:27.020]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.020 --> 03:17:29.020]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:17:29.020 --> 03:17:32.020]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.020 --> 03:17:37.020]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.020 --> 03:17:39.020]  I can help you too.
[03:17:39.020 --> 03:17:42.020]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[03:17:54.020 --> 03:17:57.020]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:17:57.020 --> 03:18:02.020]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talk to a lot of people here in New York City
[03:18:02.020 --> 03:18:06.020]  and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.020 --> 03:18:15.020]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:18:15.020 --> 03:18:19.020]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:21.020]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.020 --> 03:18:23.020]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.020 --> 03:18:29.020]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.020 --> 03:18:34.020]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.020 --> 03:18:43.020]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.020 --> 03:18:52.020]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:54.020]  Thank you, sir, for calling.

[03:19:53.020 --> 03:20:21.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:21.020 --> 03:20:33.020]  Okay, we're back in this segment. I'd like to talk more about social media censorship. And it's really not just social media. You know, we're a capitalist free market country.
[03:20:33.020 --> 03:20:43.020]  So we think, well, hey, you know, Google, it's a private industry. But Google would not have ever existed without the federal government subsidizing it, getting it off the ground.
[03:20:43.020 --> 03:20:52.020]  And now it's a leviathan that has more power than standard oil or or the, you know, the railroad monopolies could have ever dreamed of.
[03:20:52.020 --> 03:21:03.020]  You know, this is in the in the early 20th century, monopolies that weren't as powerful as Google were broken up. That's why anti trust law was was created.
[03:21:03.020 --> 03:21:16.020]  But today, we see it that it's grown. It's grown so strong and so powerful that I think that congressmen are afraid of it. Not only are do they get funding from Facebook and Google.
[03:21:16.020 --> 03:21:23.020]  But I think they're, they're actually terrified of what they know about these congressmen.
[03:21:23.020 --> 03:21:40.020]  It's virtually its own FBI now or its own NSA. When you've been scooping up everybody's phone calls and video feeds, hell, you've got you've got listening devices in your room that are recording your conversations, you know, Alexa, Siri, etc.
[03:21:40.020 --> 03:21:52.020]  You know, who knows what they're hearing and storing away. And even if they're not, people are going to be afraid that it's going to happen, that that their private sins are going to be revealed.
[03:21:52.020 --> 03:22:02.020]  And there's just, there's just no way at this point, I think the Congress can put this genie back in the bottle. I don't think that it's going to be.
[03:22:02.020 --> 03:22:19.020]  There's going to be any anti trust legislation before the 2020 election. And that means we're really fighting an uphill battle. You know, we're on a we're on a very slanted playing field, where all of the search results take you away from
[03:22:19.020 --> 03:22:35.020]  conservative sites and towards, you know, liberal propaganda. Somebody who, who is on the front line of this battle, who's, who's got a small but very important website called Vlad Tepes blog.
[03:22:35.020 --> 03:22:50.020]  Vlad is, is a linchpin where, from all over the world, videos and other stories are collated and translated. It doesn't do any good to translate something weeks after the fact.
[03:22:50.020 --> 03:23:06.020]  If there's a news story, for example, in Italy, did you know that there are there is a German NGO ship flagged today to I believe Denmark, that's been floating around the Mediterranean trying to land.
[03:23:06.020 --> 03:23:24.020]  And the Italian President, Prime Minister Salvini has said, hell no, you can just go on to Germany. We don't care. Well, when Salvini makes these statements, the translations are put up almost the same day is in within the same news cycle.
[03:23:24.020 --> 03:23:37.020]  That's Vlad Tepes blogs doing. Anyway, I'd like to bring him on because he's really got his, his finger on the pulse of social media censorship, and what we can do about it, you know, what tools we have available.
[03:23:37.020 --> 03:23:39.020]  Are you there, Vlad?
[03:23:39.020 --> 03:23:58.020]  Yes, thank you so much for this opportunity. I gotta say, it's quite an honor to be on the show with you. Can I just say, before we get into the social media thing, I'm with a kind of a team of volunteers, including myself, but we're part of a team of maybe 20 of
[03:23:58.020 --> 03:24:13.020]  us that speak different languages that translate subtitle and edit. I work with the Baron over at Gates of Vienna, who oversees all the translation, make sure that they all work and they make sense, and a bunch of very dedicated translators that both translate stuff
[03:24:13.020 --> 03:24:29.020]  that people send in via my daily readers comments or that they find themselves. It's important. And we've, we've been, we've been covering stories that the Western world either ignored or lied about, especially anything to do with conservative or non leftist leader, like Victor
[03:24:29.020 --> 03:24:43.020]  and Hungry, we translate all of its speeches that concern our issues, because the New York Times and these other papers literally lie about what he said and who he is, and we translate his stuff, no editorializing, you can judge for yourself.
[03:24:43.020 --> 03:24:49.020]  And so yes, I think it's important work and, and thank you for pointing that out.
[03:24:49.020 --> 03:25:06.020]  Yeah, and this the translation work is really important because one of the goals of our social media social justice warrior propagandists is to isolate us and make us think that, you know, that Trump is an is an individual isolated lunatic case at the
[03:25:06.020 --> 03:25:22.020]  rest of the world is is tilting towards globalism, when really the rest of the world is now in a, in a national populist uprising. And our own English based media won't tell the truth about it. So you have to go to original sources.
[03:25:22.020 --> 03:25:25.020]  And that means rapid translation.
[03:25:25.020 --> 03:25:38.020]  But that's it. You have to go to original sources. And of course, because like my YouTube channel, which had 30,000 subscribers that YouTube even admitted to and millions and millions of views tip, tens of millions of views.
[03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:54.020]  And YouTube suddenly like I get one email from YouTube every six months about some issue and would meant it would be nothing, right? Nothing would happen. And then all of a sudden, over the course of three or four days, I started getting 151220 emails a day for several days,
[03:25:54.020 --> 03:26:07.020]  complaining about videos that have been there for years. And they were totally innocuous. It was not a copyright issue was, you know, whatever community standards, but they were just innocuous. There are nothing videos. And then they just knocked my channel off the air.
[03:26:07.020 --> 03:26:18.020]  Now, that was, you know, the beginning of the big purge that we're seeing now. And of course, with the revelations that we're seeing about Google, which of course owns YouTube, it's beginning to make sense as to what's going on.
[03:26:18.020 --> 03:26:28.020]  So I mean, there's a couple of things I'd like to talk about solutions that that your listeners can actually do to solve problems, a couple of which they don't know they have yet. We're going to get into that.
[03:26:28.020 --> 03:26:46.020]  But I'd also like to talk about other other ways of doing social media because alternatives have to have to happen. And because these centralized platforms like like YouTube and Twitter and so on, either they become corrupt and very, very leftist,
[03:26:46.020 --> 03:26:55.020]  or leftist and corrupt organizations that are solitary and leftist in nature will put pressure on them to see to it that they can no longer do what they do.
[03:26:55.020 --> 03:27:05.020]  But YouTube and these organizations have been cheating us for a long time in subtle ways, not really notifying our subscribers that we have product out or not suggesting us or whatever.
[03:27:05.020 --> 03:27:17.020]  Right. But now they're out and out. I have to say, I'm kind of grateful. They're actually showing their sort of Soviet like face now and saying we won't let you guys participate in this at all because we don't like your content.
[03:27:17.020 --> 03:27:21.020]  And in a way, I find that refreshing compared to how it's been for the last couple of years.
[03:27:21.020 --> 03:27:37.020]  Right. Kudos to Project Veritas for these exposés. And it shows not only how Soviet like the Google and Facebook are, but that our mainstream media is not even covering the story.
[03:27:37.020 --> 03:27:46.020]  I mean, the mainstream media is completely ignoring the Project Veritas exposé on Google's anti-conservative bias.
[03:27:46.020 --> 03:27:57.020]  If the Pulitzer Prize was a real thing, the Project Veritas would have won it every year for the last, I don't know how many years, but there's nobody even that comes second place.
[03:27:57.020 --> 03:28:01.020]  Right. It's like Project Veritas and then 11. You know what I mean?
[03:28:01.020 --> 03:28:11.020]  Can you imagine? And YouTube took down YouTube, which is a subsidiary of Google, took down the Project Veritas Google video based on privacy concerns.
[03:28:11.020 --> 03:28:20.020]  Back when 60 Minutes was a thing, you know, doing secret undercover videos, that was like the mark of the true champion and hero.
[03:28:20.020 --> 03:28:29.020]  Now, mainstream media and social media are all for privacy when it comes to keeping the secrets of big social media.
[03:28:29.020 --> 03:28:37.020]  Well, I have to say that at least once a day I write on my website that selective enforcement is the first tool that the dollar carries.
[03:28:37.020 --> 03:28:42.020]  The first tool of a buyer, right? We're going to be back. We're going to a break now.
[03:28:42.020 --> 03:29:11.020]  We're going to be back in a couple minutes and take up the conversation right on the other side with Vlad Tepes.
[03:29:12.020 --> 03:29:17.020]  It's 4.5 to 5 star customer reviews on Amazon.com or Walmart.com.

[03:29:54.020 --> 03:30:04.020]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this. We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have, do their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[03:30:04.020 --> 03:30:15.020]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year. We need to be provisioned and you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[03:30:15.020 --> 03:30:26.020]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin. I'm bloody and then I'm up politically. I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[03:30:26.020 --> 03:30:32.020]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds. I need gas. I need ammo politically now.
[03:30:32.020 --> 03:30:39.020]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable. We're unstoppable together.
[03:30:39.020 --> 03:30:46.020]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy. I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us.
[03:30:46.020 --> 03:30:53.020]  And I will never back down. You have my commitment. This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[03:30:53.020 --> 03:31:00.020]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the maximum alert. We wouldn't be here without you. I thank you for your support and your help.
[03:31:00.020 --> 03:31:10.020]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at infowarstore.com.
[03:31:10.020 --> 03:31:16.020]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists. We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[03:31:49.020 --> 03:31:54.020]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night. We're not going to back down.
[03:31:54.020 --> 03:32:04.020]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[03:32:04.020 --> 03:32:18.020]  The false claim that you purposely said kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false. It's a smear. Somebody sends you something that's encrypted. You don't even open it.
[03:32:18.020 --> 03:32:29.020]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you. This is Kafkaesque. This is bizarre. But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say,
[03:32:29.020 --> 03:32:38.020]  Jones sent kiddie porn is really outrageous. I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[03:32:38.020 --> 03:32:48.020]  But I went to wear the big boys. Where's the Wall Street Journal? Where's Associated Press? When are they going to report that they made a mistake? And what they said about you was inaccurate.
[03:32:48.020 --> 03:33:01.020]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Infowars with your dollars.
[03:33:18.020 --> 03:33:28.020]  It's Alex Jones, and now your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:28.020 --> 03:33:57.020]  When we went to break up, I was talking to Vlad Tepes, obviously a synonym, a nom de guerre. A lot of the people that Vlad works with are in denied or semi-denied areas. And what I mean by that is they're in places where the police come and knock on the door if you make posts that they consider Islamophobic, for example.
[03:33:57.020 --> 03:34:17.020]  And really what it comes down to is the powers that be in a lot of the Western world, they're invested in this replacement population. They may not know that they're being used as foot soldiers in this struggle, but that's what it comes down to.
[03:34:17.020 --> 03:34:32.020]  The big obstacle to globalism is intelligent, free people who understand history. There's not a single low IQ third world country that's free and prosperous.
[03:34:32.020 --> 03:34:47.020]  Because in every one of these countries, you're going to always get some type of a strong man, an Idi Amin, who's going to come to power promising everybody free bread and circuses. The dumber the better.
[03:34:47.020 --> 03:34:56.020]  The dumber the poorer, the better. And I don't care if you're in Italy, Canada, the United States, the process is the same.
[03:34:56.020 --> 03:35:13.020]  It's the George Soros backed globalists, which essentially to me are just communists using a new tactic. In the 20th century, they tried exporting Bolshevism by force using spies and subterfuge.
[03:35:13.020 --> 03:35:24.020]  Then they used the Gramscian long march through the institutions, which was extremely successful. And now our universities just churn out little Marxists.
[03:35:24.020 --> 03:35:37.020]  And the other, the new tactic is straight up population replacement, just sending in hordes of people who are going to vote for socialism, because their understanding is at a very low level.
[03:35:37.020 --> 03:35:48.020]  And if somebody says, I'll give you lots of free stuff, that's where the vote goes. That's why the Democrats absolutely are going to do nothing to secure the border.
[03:35:48.020 --> 03:36:06.020]  They want the border wide open, because that's how it's all going to work. So when we were when we left, Vlad was talking about some of the solutions to the present social media censorship and other tactics that we can employ so that we can still continue to communicate,
[03:36:06.020 --> 03:36:17.020]  even as the as the matrix is tightened around us. So go ahead, Vlad, with what we were talking about ideas for countering the censorship.
[03:36:17.020 --> 03:36:30.020]  So there's two, I like to address two possible set solutions that address slightly different problem. They have the the technical oligarchs, the Googles and the twitters and so on.
[03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:38.020]  Let's begin with, let's begin with how we can deal with that. Well, there's a difference between a distributed system and a centralized system.
[03:36:38.020 --> 03:36:48.020]  In terms of the internet, please make it sound more complicated than it is. But really, it's pretty simple. Like in a city, if you turn your tap on, all the water comes from municipal water, the centralized source, right?
[03:36:48.020 --> 03:36:59.020]  Ideally, what you want is a distributed source where everybody is sharing and everybody else's thing. There's no central things. You can't really, you can't cut any particular person off.
[03:36:59.020 --> 03:37:09.020]  Right. So the way to do that is by an old technology called bit torrenting. Bit torrenting for those people, I'm sure that none of your listeners do it.
[03:37:09.020 --> 03:37:19.020]  But I'm sure some of all of your listeners know somebody that might download a TV show or a movie from a site without necessarily going to a store.
[03:37:19.020 --> 03:37:32.020]  Well, this is the technology used to deliver that is called bit torrenting. And what happens is it's kind of like everybody's like imagine, you know, 500 people all photocopying a couple of pages of a phone book and making and giving
[03:37:32.020 --> 03:37:44.020]  there a couple of pages to whoever doesn't have it. So with a minimum number of copies, each person gets a whole phone book rather than one person copying the phone book and giving a copy to each person, which would be clumsy.
[03:37:44.020 --> 03:37:57.020]  But it keeps that person in control. See what I'm saying? So I'm sure this will, it'll make sense after people think about it a bit. But the idea is that you have the minimum number of internet transactions between peers, everybody who's equal in the system.
[03:37:57.020 --> 03:38:02.020]  Right. Okay. So that's, that's what it is doing. That's what this he does.
[03:38:02.020 --> 03:38:14.020]  Yeah, I'm not clear on that. That's what bit you that's definitely bit you says that they do that. And in some ways they definitely do. They're the videos are coming to your browser and being assembled from a torrent. That's for sure.
[03:38:14.020 --> 03:38:22.020]  True. Right. So it should is an alternative. And it's a good one. Right. And it's reliable. It's been up for years. And it's good. Right.
[03:38:22.020 --> 03:38:38.020]  There's, there's a bunch of other ones that deserve mentioned, even though they're not mature platforms yet. One is bit.tube. Now, bit.tube is undergoing some transformation. They're trying to improve it and they're trying to create a sense a decentralized thing, which will be like
[03:38:38.020 --> 03:38:50.020]  Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and all that. And it'll all be based around the hub of crypto, cryptocurrencies so that you'll actually be earning cryptocurrency by using the platform rather than paying to use it.
[03:38:50.020 --> 03:39:03.020]  It'll pay you. We're not talking about a lot here, though, but it's enough to keep the thing going because some percentage of the crypto you generate goes back to the people who founded it. It sounds more complicated than it is.
[03:39:03.020 --> 03:39:14.020]  But the main thing is it's a decentralized platform which can't be censored because there's no central node. Right. And another one that's quite good is bit.tube. And these are not mature platforms.
[03:39:14.020 --> 03:39:22.020]  D, like the letter D, is in Delta. D is in Delta. Yeah. So D.tube.
[03:39:22.020 --> 03:39:35.020]  D.tube. And in fact, there, it's a bit of a procedure to sign up. People might get frustrated. It's okay. It's worth it. You just have to sort of, as the lady Macbeth said, screw your courage to the sticking place and make the decision to go through it.
[03:39:35.020 --> 03:39:50.020]  And the next thing you know, you've got a channel where you can upload your videos and they're, they can't be taken down because they're all. I noticed, I noticed that last week when Black Pigeon speaks, who I can't recommend his channel enough.
[03:39:50.020 --> 03:40:00.020]  When he was taken down for about a day until the public outcry, he has said that he is now putting his videos up on BitShoot 24 hours before YouTube.
[03:40:00.020 --> 03:40:08.020]  And what he's trying to do is get people to go to BitShoot first and cause like a migration that way.
[03:40:08.020 --> 03:40:19.020]  Well, that's what has to happen. People are going to have to abandon these traditional platforms because they, they're no longer what they were. And that brings me to, I'd like to take a slightly different angle on these platforms than other people do.
[03:40:19.020 --> 03:40:31.020]  I mean, virtually everybody else. I think there's an article that I'd like to draw people attention to. It's on, not the well-known site, but the author of the site is one of the best internet security people in the world.
[03:40:31.020 --> 03:40:40.020]  And he's, shall I say, he's a friend of ours, all of ours. He keeps a lot of sites that we all read up and say, and this site is called Free Speech Defense.
[03:40:40.020 --> 03:40:50.020]  And it's an article he wrote in 2016 where he proves how Google was manipulating search results back then. And the reason I think this is so important.
[03:40:50.020 --> 03:41:00.020]  I keep this article back in my mind all the time is because I think the way to get Google and these other agencies is by fraud, like charge them with fraud because they're committing fraud.
[03:41:00.020 --> 03:41:09.020]  What they do is they have their own rules about how they operate. They say, okay, well, when you do a search, search results will be based on the frequency and authority of the results.
[03:41:09.020 --> 03:41:18.020]  And, you know, you can read it yourself. You can read the article. But Google has a very rational set of rules as to how a search will yield results.
[03:41:18.020 --> 03:41:25.020]  And they're good. And it's exactly if it worked the way they said it would work, then we should all trust it and use it, which we did for a long time.
[03:41:25.020 --> 03:41:33.020]  But what happened, of course, is they, probably a guy named Matt Cutts, who's a Google VP and he's a master of search engine manipulation,
[03:41:33.020 --> 03:41:39.020]  who also coincidentally worked in the Obama White House for a while while he was VP of Google Go Figure.
[03:41:39.020 --> 03:41:48.020]  But they started manipulating the search results in a way to give results they want you to see rather than what you are looking for based on Google's own rules.
[03:41:48.020 --> 03:41:57.020]  So I think the way to go after these guys is to charge them with fraud. And I mean, on a huge scale, I'm talking about the biggest fraud case in the history of the world.
[03:41:57.020 --> 03:42:06.020]  Because they are, and here's, Matt, Matt. Maybe that might happen. It might happen in the U.S. justice system under Attorney General Barr, I can't say.
[03:42:06.020 --> 03:42:15.020]  But I think that Congress is afraid. I think people are too afraid. I think we've passed a tipping point. We've just got 40 seconds till the next break.
[03:42:15.020 --> 03:42:23.020]  But I think personally that we have passed a tipping point where the tech giants are so powerful that they're untouchable.
[03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:32.020]  And the most important thing was that James O'Keeffe blew their cover with the latest undercover videos, really proving their bias.
[03:42:32.020 --> 03:42:40.020]  And getting them flat out saying, we can't have another Trump situation. We can't let another 2016 happen.
[03:42:40.020 --> 03:42:53.020]  They have far more power, and now they've demonstrated their desire to change the result, like they did in the pro-life versus abortion election.
[03:43:10.020 --> 03:43:20.020]  This size and scale of this public reach, it is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure
[03:43:20.020 --> 03:43:28.020]  that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting infowars.
[03:43:28.020 --> 03:43:37.020]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[03:43:37.020 --> 03:43:45.020]  The ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.020 --> 03:43:53.020]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment, and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:53.020 --> 03:44:09.020]  Serving with Infowars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily, our break room at the Infowars headquarters is stock full of high quality, Infowars store, Patriot blend coffee.
[03:44:09.020 --> 03:44:26.020]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup. A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[03:44:26.020 --> 03:44:36.020]  There has never been a more important time to support Infowars. So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[03:44:36.020 --> 03:44:54.020]  Order now at the Infowars store. Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot blend coffee delivered right to your door at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:54.020 --> 03:45:06.020]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[03:45:06.020 --> 03:45:16.020]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[03:45:16.020 --> 03:45:27.020]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, Infowars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[03:45:27.020 --> 03:45:35.020]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks, we've gone through so much because of your support.
[03:45:35.020 --> 03:45:47.020]  You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault. So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:47.020 --> 03:45:54.020]  It's your fight. Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue because we could be shut down.
[03:45:54.020 --> 03:46:07.020]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this. And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Infowars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[03:46:07.020 --> 03:46:15.020]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it, okay? But you move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get $20,000.
[03:46:15.020 --> 03:46:21.020]  That doesn't pay for all the infrastructure, the bandwidth, the lawyers, the crew. So we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars of product.
[03:46:21.020 --> 03:46:29.020]  I want to expand, not contract. And for six months, we've not just made a standstill. The enemy's been winning. And I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[03:46:29.020 --> 03:46:38.020]  I like to be expanding. I like to be winning. I like to be fighting. And we are winning the Info War. That's why we're so hated. But we need to be retreaded. We need to be tuned up. We need to be fixed up.
[03:46:38.020 --> 03:46:45.020]  We never have time to get into drive up. We got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to silence us. Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[03:46:45.020 --> 03:46:52.020]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else. I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the Chai Comm Show.
[03:46:52.020 --> 03:47:19.020]  Go to inforwarstore.com.
[03:47:22.020 --> 03:47:41.020]  The place is where you used to break. It was an inside joke. By the world connected. Your little protest. So merrily rejected. It was an inside joke.
[03:47:41.020 --> 03:47:56.020]  All right. Last segment with Matt Bracken and Vlad Tepes of Vlad Tepes blog. You know, people sometimes complain to me about the inconvenience of using alternative social media.
[03:47:56.020 --> 03:48:16.020]  And I just have to shake my head. You know that obviously the tech tyrants, they try to keep it as much of a monopoly or at least like a cartel as possible. They don't, for example, allow you to put up a button to share one gap or mines.
[03:48:16.020 --> 03:48:38.020]  You can only have a button to share on approved good comrades social media like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. But what I do, and so this is my little effort, it takes a second of effort to actually copy and paste a URL into GAB or Freezoxy or other social media.
[03:48:38.020 --> 03:48:56.020]  I call it parallel posting. So instead of just putting, I've been banned on Twitter forever. I've been banned for the next 29 days on Facebook for a post I made three years ago, just a short statement about Islam, my opinion, they went back three years,
[03:48:56.020 --> 03:49:10.020]  harvested a comment and used it as an excuse to kick me off for another 30 days. I only stay on to sort of like test their censorship, but spread it around. Don't just post your video to YouTube.
[03:49:10.020 --> 03:49:25.020]  Post it to BitShoot. Post it to DTube, to BitTube. If you have all of these open in your browser, you copy the URL, you can do all the work, boom, boom, boom. Now you've tripled or quadrupled your output without much effort.
[03:49:25.020 --> 03:49:41.020]  And your reach, your network is going to be that much more extensive. Maybe not everybody will see you on Facebook, they might catch you on GAB, Freezoxy, Parler, Mines. Post as much as you can everywhere that you can.
[03:49:41.020 --> 03:50:01.020]  Now back in the Soviet Union, some is that you might have gotten a fifth generation of carbon copy, really a blurry copy of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, or on every street corner, you could get a slick, full-color copy of Pravda and his vestia.
[03:50:01.020 --> 03:50:13.020]  You know, if all you care about is something slick and convenient, you're just going to be lapping up the propaganda. If you want to be a freedom fighter for truth, you might have to make a little bit more effort.
[03:50:13.020 --> 03:50:30.020]  And yes, that includes supporting the Infowars Store because this is one of the main channels. This is it. This is how we keep the frequency open and it takes money. So support the Infowars Store and keep free speech rolling.
[03:50:30.020 --> 03:50:38.020]  All right, Vlad, let's come back now with more suggestions for getting around big social media.
[03:50:38.020 --> 03:50:52.020]  Okay, so now let's cut to the technical stuff, how you can bypass. So there's also another state censorship thing where various, Australia, and it looks like now there's a breaking story on jihad watch.
[03:50:52.020 --> 03:51:03.020]  If you go to the top post at jihadwatch.org right now, more censorship, extensive new blocks of jihad watch by internet providers in Europe and Israel and I believe other sites also.
[03:51:03.020 --> 03:51:15.020]  So where states and or ISPs decide to block certain sites for their users, and we know this happened in Australia, and I believe this is also happening in the UK.
[03:51:15.020 --> 03:51:27.020]  So the way around that is two ways. One is get a VPN. Now, frankly, everybody should have one. A virtual private network actually allows you to convince the internet that your computer is somewhere else.
[03:51:27.020 --> 03:51:36.020]  So that if you're in an area where they're blocking a certain website, you just say, okay, well, I'm in Germany or I'm in the United States, and then you'll see it.
[03:51:36.020 --> 03:51:49.020]  Okay, so get a VPN, but or and or you can read an article that's up on my site by tepis blog on how to get around these blocks by changing your DNS.
[03:51:49.020 --> 03:52:04.020]  It's actually not that difficult. And I have super clear step by step instructions, as well as a video on how to do it on all your devices, your Apple or a PC or your phone, if your phone's Android or whatever.
[03:52:04.020 --> 03:52:15.020]  So way to do it is in short form, you go to your control panel, you look for your internet settings, you look for DNS, and you change them to public DNS settings.
[03:52:15.020 --> 03:52:28.020]  And I give the numbers in the article. Obviously, it'd be sort of goofy to make mention here, no one's going to remember it, but you put in different DNS numbers and then suddenly they the ISP cannot block you.
[03:52:28.020 --> 03:52:35.020]  I do that changes free by the way, I was just reminded by somebody who's listening and knows this stuff really well.
[03:52:35.020 --> 03:52:48.020]  The DNS changes free and it gets you past because what happens when you sign up for the ISP, an internet service provider will give you certain DNS numbers and then they can control what you see.
[03:52:48.020 --> 03:52:58.020]  They control the flow of traffic through that DNS, but you are not obliged to use it. So you switch to these public DNS numbers, all blockages are gone.
[03:52:58.020 --> 03:53:09.020]  And it doesn't have the effect of a VPN because you can't trick your nation into thinking you're somewhere else. So it's more security with a VPN.
[03:53:09.020 --> 03:53:17.020]  But for the moment at least, you can change your DNS settings to public DNS numbers and boom, you can see any site you want.
[03:53:17.020 --> 03:53:39.020]  I want to mention to the American audience, if you've got great internet where you are and none of this is pertaining to you, please bear with us because this is like Radio Free Europe or Voice of America back in the Cold War days, Cold War days broadcasting into Russia or China.
[03:53:39.020 --> 03:53:52.020]  There are people around the world listening to Infowars that are writing this stuff down. This is critical information because they are behind a kind of a Google curtain now.
[03:53:52.020 --> 03:54:03.020]  They are behind a social media curtain. Obviously, it's the worst in China, but they are arresting people in the United Kingdom and in Germany from posts that they make on Facebook.
[03:54:03.020 --> 03:54:20.020]  So people have to be super careful and protect themselves. These countries aren't free the way we think of them anymore. So bear with us because this Infowars today is like Radio Free Europe broadcasting to the censored and unfree world.
[03:54:20.020 --> 03:54:23.020]  Go ahead, Vlad. We've got three minutes.
[03:54:23.020 --> 03:54:41.020]  The police have been showing up at people's door in the UK for liking a joke or a post on Twitter. It's going full Soviet. The difference between the Soviet Union and some parts, some aspects and some places in the Western world like the UK are now just a function of
[03:54:41.020 --> 03:55:01.020]  not ideologically different, right? Between the brainwashing of children, whether it's sex or gender related. Of course, Islam, it's ludicrous. They're talking about now finding parents if you pull your kids out of Islamic indoctrination classes in schools.
[03:55:01.020 --> 03:55:15.020]  I mean, the schools are becoming political indoctrination centers beginning to become. It's terrifying. And the free flow of information, there's no free people without the ability to make your own decisions and you can't make your own decisions if you can't get all the information.
[03:55:15.020 --> 03:55:27.020]  And information is now being very, very carefully managed. I think it's an obligation on all of us to use all of these things possible. You used the word Samistat earlier, one of my favorite concepts.
[03:55:27.020 --> 03:55:37.020]  The original Samistat, people would leave notes and books and libraries. It was incredibly clandestine, very dangerous to do and everybody had to do a lot of work and take a lot of risk.
[03:55:37.020 --> 03:55:47.020]  All we have to do is use alternative platforms. We just have to understand the evolution of these technologies and we have to do a little bit, a little bit of frustration and work to get our message out there.
[03:55:47.020 --> 03:55:57.020]  I won't be stopped. We do these videos, I do between one and five news videos every single day because they matter and then they can be embedded in all these different sites.
[03:55:57.020 --> 03:56:11.020]  The trick is, like I say, the rest, the obligation on the rest of us is use public DNS, get a VPN, understand how these companies are defrauding us and stand up and fight back and covertly or overtly.
[03:56:11.020 --> 03:56:27.020]  Whether we can or we can't, we have to do it. And while you can, consider buying the actual dead tree version of books like my books or Diana Wests and others because there's going to be coming a time when they're just going to be mass deleted.
[03:56:27.020 --> 03:56:42.020]  I mean, Jihad Watch is a super important website and it's being suppressed everywhere. But Robert Spencer, not to be confused with the other Spencer, Robert Spencer is a prolific author. He has, you know, a dozen amazing, amazing books.
[03:56:42.020 --> 03:56:57.020]  Well, you can support the author and get the message in a form that can never be corrupted or deleted. If you buy the actual, you know, real book, the printed book, then no matter what happens down the road, you'll at least be in a position to share it with friends.
[03:56:57.020 --> 03:57:09.020]  You know, even as the internet suppression increases, because people are going to be afraid to open up a website if they're afraid, you know, the police are going to come or they might lose their job.
[03:57:09.020 --> 03:57:16.020]  I mean, literally, you can, in the UK, you can lose your job over what you posted on the internet. And that's what's coming.
[03:57:16.020 --> 03:57:29.020]  Well, thank you, Vlad Tepes. And I recommend everybody, you know, frequent his website because it's an essential hub to show how the national populism message is spreading all around the world.
[03:57:29.020 --> 03:57:39.020]  And Vlad Tepes blog is an essential link and it's really a hub for that message. This is Matt Bracken and I'll see you next Thursday.
[03:58:00.020 --> 03:58:12.020]  Let's meet the candidates. All Star, Beto, Root. Oh my gosh, Corey Booker, the amazing, oh, Pocahontas, Joe Biden.
[03:58:12.020 --> 03:58:29.020]  Swallowswell says who's new gun owners, yay, Bernie, Ben Best, Liza, Sonya, Yuga, Camila Harris, and so many more. It's The Greatest Show on Earth at infowars.com forward slash show Wednesday and Thursday night.
[03:58:29.020 --> 03:58:44.020]  The Greatest Comedy Show on Earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs. June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:58:44.020 --> 03:58:47.020]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:58:47.020 --> 03:58:56.020]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:58:56.020 --> 03:59:05.020]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:59:05.020 --> 03:59:13.020]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.020 --> 03:59:19.020]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.020 --> 03:59:27.020]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80. But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[03:59:27.020 --> 03:59:33.020]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.020 --> 03:59:41.020]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:41.020 --> 03:59:51.020]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
