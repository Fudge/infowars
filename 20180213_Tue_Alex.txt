[00:00.000 --> 00:29.840]  As usual, I have an overflowing cornucopia of critical,
[00:29.840 --> 00:36.080]  news, incredible clips, amazing guest in studio guest you name it. But the first thing we need
[00:36.080 --> 00:43.360]  to just point out here is this is CNBC's headline. AI will be billions of times smarter than humans
[00:43.360 --> 00:47.120]  and man needs to merge with it. Experts say at the World Government Summit
[00:47.840 --> 00:55.360]  hosted in Dubai with CNBC and that the agreement, the consensus is humanity's over
[00:55.360 --> 01:00.160]  and then we need to decide how we're going to merge with machines. That is the total
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.520]  globalist takeover plan and I've been warning you about for 20 plus years that the media attacks
[01:05.520 --> 01:12.320]  me for daily. They try to ban us for but there are the facts, ladies and gentlemen. Meanwhile,
[01:12.320 --> 01:20.080]  who could get over this headline? Vatican, China is the best example of church's social doctrine,
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.920]  Beijing defends human dignity, Bishop says, and the Pope's gone on to second that.
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.720]  Conservative Catholics are expressing shock at Pope Francis' zeal and embracing with his
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.600]  authoritarian government of China. Think about that. China has killed more of its people than
[01:35.600 --> 01:41.760]  anybody else in history. Everybody puts down the Chinese being used on the railroad and Western
[01:41.760 --> 01:49.280]  expansion. It's true, Chinese merchants would bring with Chinese in slave cages and sign contracts
[01:49.280 --> 01:57.040]  with companies to let the women be prostitutes until they died. You name it and today they sell
[01:57.040 --> 02:04.560]  Buddhists, Christians, organs. It's a total totalitarian regime but the Pope says it's great.
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.080]  Now that's just two articles. So world government's here, world government summit.
[02:10.080 --> 02:16.480]  We're going to get rid of you. Communism's great. The Vatican's totally captured by the globalist.
[02:16.480 --> 02:22.000]  Just think about how insane, I told you there'd be a Pope 10 years ago that would endorse communism
[02:22.880 --> 02:29.200]  and say China is the best to its people. It's all about a sick joke. It's like he's got 200 foot
[02:29.200 --> 02:33.280]  walls but he says let more Islamists stand and let them rape and kill everybody and meanwhile
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.640]  his deputy's a pedophile and all this other stuff happens and this is some sick people.
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.760]  Meanwhile, Obama's artist portrays white girl beheaded by empowered black woman.
[02:43.760 --> 02:56.000]  Imagine if Trump had a painter, had a portrait here who on the side jobs knowingly painted images
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.960]  of empowered black women. There's several images of these cutting women's heads off. In fact the
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.640]  article we have only has one of them but you can pull up. Here it is. The royalty of the black woman
[03:08.640 --> 03:18.400]  is only expressed by chopping white women's heads off and I also paint sperm all over the paintings.
[03:18.400 --> 03:24.800]  I'm not kidding. You can't make this up. So that's the type of mental illness we've got operating here
[03:26.080 --> 03:31.120]  and the type of true anti-human degeneracy being pushed by the globalist to cause total divide
[03:31.120 --> 03:36.480]  and conquer. Meanwhile, Yellowstone eruptions, supervolcano under strain, experts find magma
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.000]  chamber pressure increasing and that is going to dial into some other big stories we've got along
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.920]  those lines. Bill Gates is calling for censorship against the internet. What he calls hate speech
[03:47.920 --> 03:53.520]  and so is the head of Unilever telling YouTube and others if you don't start censoring libertarians
[03:53.520 --> 03:57.840]  and conservatives we're going to pull our money. Doesn't mean don't run our ads on their shows.
[03:58.880 --> 04:05.120]  Just get rid of them period. So the authoritarianism is truly metastasizing as humanity awakens from
[04:05.120 --> 04:10.320]  slumber to this serious threat. Speaking of that nationalism sweeps Costa Rica. Christian preacher
[04:10.320 --> 04:15.280]  shocks presidential election. We're going to be getting into that versus the hell on earth that
[04:15.280 --> 04:22.880]  is Venezuela as that descends from anarchy into total and complete barbarism and also North
[04:22.880 --> 04:28.960]  Korea threatens more electromagnetic pulse attacks on the west and I've gotten a lot of
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.400]  shocking contacts for our military contacts but what they're being briefed on what they're being
[04:32.400 --> 04:38.160]  told about the end of March into early April the fact that I think North Korea may test more
[04:38.160 --> 04:46.640]  missiles or even attack Japan or Seoul South Korea after the games so that is definitely
[04:46.640 --> 04:52.000]  being put out there by the Pentagon for anybody that will listen so it's all coming up in an
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.480]  incredibly important transmission oh and some other key little goodies there they're going to ban
[04:56.480 --> 05:03.440]  best friends in public schools I want to tell you about an exciting new product we have available

[05:59.120 --> 06:16.880]  today
[06:16.880 --> 06:32.720]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:32.720 --> 06:39.440]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday the 13th day already of February
[06:39.440 --> 06:43.040]  2018 we're going to be live here for the next four hours and there's the war room
[06:43.040 --> 06:48.880]  with Owen shroyer and roger stone will be in studio coming up today as well again thank you so much
[06:48.880 --> 06:57.520]  for joining us coming up the pope has said that communist china embodies human dignity and taking
[06:57.520 --> 07:04.240]  care of little people that's like saying at all fitler embodies jews living long healthy lives
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.720]  but it's all about breaking your will totally confusing you and demoralizing you the globalist
[07:10.720 --> 07:17.200]  with their doctrine of communism have totally captured the Vatican using child sex rings and
[07:17.200 --> 07:22.160]  blackmail which is all that in the news meanwhile obama's artist portrays white girl beheaded by
[07:22.160 --> 07:26.400]  empowered black woman it doesn't just show that that she painted hundreds of these paintings
[07:26.400 --> 07:32.320]  or this individual has showing that the royalty of a black woman is to kill white people is the
[07:32.320 --> 07:42.960]  quote to show the total embodiment of this is critical again our article only posted a few
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.760]  of these we go to the wrap now they've got a whole bunch of these with the evil white women
[07:48.480 --> 07:56.160]  having their heads chopped off so that is all going to be coming up in the next segment when
[07:56.160 --> 08:00.080]  i line all that up and get that ready to show you i want to show you the full horror of this
[08:00.080 --> 08:06.960]  uh again imagine if president trump or anybody else had a personally hired to be their painter
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.080]  and who paints images of white people murdering black people but this is all about hyping up
[08:14.080 --> 08:19.520]  the total racism and total racial division knowing that it was whites and westerners
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.200]  and christians that tried to end slavery globally so we have that guilt complex we will submit then
[08:25.200 --> 08:30.960]  to people being trained to openly kill us so this is the total hollywood war that's why they've
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.720]  got black panther coming out a germany afghan migrant killed woman in front of her kids because
[08:36.720 --> 08:44.800]  she converted to christianity sessions invokes anglo-american heritage of sheriff's office they
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.360]  they call it some type of nazi code word that's in the supreme court rulings and states like
[08:49.360 --> 08:56.960]  saying judaeo christian because the old testament's judaic the new testament is is the new testament
[08:56.960 --> 09:03.520]  it is it is uh that uh that's what it's called injurious prudence that's where it came from
[09:04.400 --> 09:10.000]  just like saying the romantic languages come out of rome it's just a simple scientific word a term
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.480]  but see they don't care because it's all about waging war on reality waging war on communication
[09:20.480 --> 09:23.680]  now continuing here ladies and gentlemen that's just some of what's coming up
[09:24.480 --> 09:28.800]  we're also as i mentioned earlier going to get into uh open calls for world government at the
[09:28.800 --> 09:35.360]  world government summit but again we're coaxing crazy world government does not exist at all
[09:35.360 --> 09:41.920]  but the first thing i want to air is a little special report the illusion of globalism is
[09:41.920 --> 09:47.360]  beginning to fade i want to air that report the illusion of globalism is beginning to phase before
[09:47.360 --> 09:52.720]  we run through all of this incredibly important information uh for you here today and i have
[09:52.720 --> 09:59.200]  huge news on the north korean front as well but first here's this report the illusion of globalism
[09:59.200 --> 10:05.680]  is beginning to fade and once you've taken your blinders off or you could reverse that and said
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.440]  taking the sunglasses uh uh that the establishment doesn't want you to wear and put them on like
[10:11.440 --> 10:18.960]  they live you then see for yourself that you've been lied to over and over again by so-called
[10:18.960 --> 10:24.160]  mainstream media that's simply bought and paid for by multinational interests that have conquered
[10:24.160 --> 10:31.120]  this country and it doesn't mean that when you support info wars or president trump or nationalism
[10:31.120 --> 10:37.840]  or pre-market capitalism that you think you're perfect or you think we're perfect but we know
[10:37.840 --> 10:44.080]  it works a thousand times better and is what builds big open free wealthy societies now that
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.280]  creates the byproduct of decadence so that's certainly a real issue but globalists like
[10:49.280 --> 10:56.800]  george soros that have been openly bragging that they are funding trying to keep the uh u in control
[10:56.800 --> 11:04.560]  of countries that never voted to enter it like the uk the fact that he's so brazen and so out in
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.720]  the open only will accelerate the planetary awakening to their tyranny with another 280
[11:10.720 --> 11:17.360]  north koreans crossing the border soon all eyes will be on one member of the delegation kim jung
[11:17.360 --> 11:24.880]  un sister kim yo jung will become the first member of the kim ruling family to set foot in the country
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.800]  it's the sister of kim jung un the bloodthirsty dictator who's constantly threatening a nuke
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.880]  the us and all this and so they're there as part of a quote peace delegation because trumps put
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.080]  pressure on them for the first time ever a member of the ruling communist royal house
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.240]  the communism is always royal it's no form of royalty it's the first time they come to the
[11:44.240 --> 11:53.680]  table because they understand the trouble they're in nbc abc cbs is cnn all praised her and said
[11:53.680 --> 11:58.880]  she was glaring at pence and and liberals said oh we hope she attacks pence and oh she's so sexy
[11:58.880 --> 12:05.040]  oh she's so beautiful and then when it blew up in their face they began to remove the video
[12:05.840 --> 12:11.440]  look at this kim jung un sister stealing the show at the winter olympics oh oh my gosh
[12:11.440 --> 12:18.320]  gosh they keep more than half their population in slave camps and they admit that they quote
[12:18.320 --> 12:23.920]  take babies like you take a chicken's eggs at birth so they're not loyal to the family millions
[12:23.920 --> 12:29.360]  die every couple years uh they torture people to death like no one's ever seen in our media i
[12:29.360 --> 12:36.640]  remember lester holt kid we traveled about four hours east of beyond yang to visit a ski resort
[12:36.640 --> 12:41.920]  that has significance in the recent talks we've been watching between the north and south over the
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.800]  winter olympics this we're told is a place where athletes from the north and south will be training
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.640]  together we were also invited here i would suspect because it is not what people expect to see
[12:52.640 --> 12:59.680]  in north korea a modern ski resort it's got patriotic music and videos playing from a screen
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.640]  here and a lot of families out enjoying themselves we spoke into some of those families people
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.000]  expressing a sense of optimism that the two countries are speaking together a sense of pride
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.920]  that they will be competing together in the winter olympics and also some expressing a sense of
[13:15.920 --> 13:22.000]  greater security given a chance to ratchet down some of the tensions now you could not support
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.800]  a worse regime living on the planet stalin and hitler were as bad or worse per capita even kill
[13:28.800 --> 13:35.040]  more people but but probably not even as psychotically ridiculous i mean the north koreans
[13:35.040 --> 13:43.040]  are are are under total slavery if you are receiving this transition you are the resistance
[13:45.200 --> 13:50.080]  you know i attempted fate last week i talked about how i hadn't had really a fever or been sick
[13:50.080 --> 13:54.000]  other than allergies in about eight years and so sure enough i got a fever last night
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.080]  um and it's gone away but i am if you watch me on television you can see i'm sweating a little bit
[14:02.080 --> 14:06.800]  i bundled up last night let the fever go up to about 103 and that's what fevers do they get rid of
[14:06.800 --> 14:10.720]  bacteria viruses whatever the issues are and so i'm pretty much out of the woods thank god
[14:10.720 --> 14:17.040]  compared to everybody else's had but uh that's tempted fate for you um you know some of these
[14:17.040 --> 14:22.800]  stories i've got here are so big that i really don't even feel like i'm doing a good enough
[14:22.800 --> 14:29.200]  job just mentioning these bombshell reports but they all tie together and we're going to
[14:29.200 --> 14:35.280]  break it all down here today but let me just roll some of the footage i mentioned uh of what they
[14:35.280 --> 14:45.120]  want banned and that is when pence wasn't cheering the north koreans uh and then when uh the north
[14:45.120 --> 14:51.120]  korean dictator's sister wasn't cheering the americans and our leptis media like whoopee goldberg
[14:51.120 --> 14:58.400]  and everybody else uh have said how dare pence do this and just groveled but see there she is not
[14:58.400 --> 15:02.880]  not clapping when he was clapping uh there actually for the japanese so pence was clapping
[15:02.880 --> 15:06.640]  for the japanese there because i've seen the water shot japanese presidents holding up his
[15:06.640 --> 15:12.160]  japanese flag and so that's how they're acting but our media only ran with pence not clapping to
[15:12.160 --> 15:18.080]  say oh see how horrible pence is uh i mean the north koreans are a complete cult of evil complete
[15:18.080 --> 15:24.800]  narcissistic mental patient evil uh suppressing their own population so there's the footage uh that
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.120]  nbc has been so desperate to pull uh every people saw but we have a right to show it we have a right
[15:29.120 --> 15:34.640]  to document it we have a right to detail it uh under classic fair use to analyze what's really
[15:34.640 --> 15:40.080]  happening all right when we come back i'm going to get into how they're planning to demoralize

[15:46.240 --> 15:51.440]  how cool it is and we'll also get to that vice piece i mentioned uh where uh they have these

[19:58.480 --> 20:14.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:14.400 --> 20:32.320]  the alex jones show because there is a war on or your mind
[20:45.040 --> 20:58.160]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen and all of this ties together all the things we're facing
[20:58.160 --> 21:07.760]  all the different things we're dealing with and the big question is can humans deal with the
[21:07.760 --> 21:12.240]  technology and the systems that we have and the systems that we're developing
[21:12.240 --> 21:18.000]  because if you look at what the social engineers are doing and what their internal white papers
[21:19.680 --> 21:30.800]  admit that they are up to it is a admitted diabolical plan to bring in a one world government
[21:32.480 --> 21:39.040]  to dumb the public down and to make life so unhappy and so miserable that we accept plugging in
[21:39.040 --> 21:45.120]  to virtual reality and basically give up our consciousness and agree to be merged with machines
[21:45.120 --> 21:50.080]  believing that we're going to be given eternal life but really you're being executed when you give
[21:50.080 --> 21:55.040]  your body up and the ai computer will just be able to basically fool you
[21:59.120 --> 22:03.680]  and fool your loved ones and fool others that are conversing with it that it really is
[22:03.680 --> 22:11.680]  is the person that's gone on to merge with their silicon gods this is the admitted plan
[22:12.320 --> 22:18.080]  and they've got all these viral videos out of boston dynamics robots opening doors for each other
[22:19.120 --> 22:25.760]  and rachel phalan's written about that today for info wars dot com but the real plan being
[22:25.760 --> 22:31.040]  pushed by the world government summit in dubai this year is that humans will have to merge
[22:31.040 --> 22:37.680]  with machines and that you will not be given a choice and that humans as we know it are over
[22:38.400 --> 22:45.280]  and again that decision has been made to do that to you and your family
[22:46.880 --> 22:52.240]  and to make the world so ugly and so out of control they turn everything upside down they
[22:52.240 --> 22:56.320]  have hollywood attacking the family they have hollywood attacking the relationships of men and
[22:56.320 --> 23:02.720]  women they have the social engineers uh the jesuit pope uh francis who got into power again using
[23:02.720 --> 23:07.680]  blackmail against the other pope uh for reported pedophilia within the catholic church his deputy
[23:07.680 --> 23:13.120]  gets busted trafficking a hundred children he says last week shut it down don't talk about it
[23:13.120 --> 23:17.920]  i mean these are monsters ladies and gentlemen he comes out and says china is the best example
[23:17.920 --> 23:24.400]  of church's social doctrine nobody mentioned this three times today it's so big pope francis zeal
[23:24.400 --> 23:29.600]  and embracing a totalitarian government of china by first agreeing to replacing underground church
[23:29.600 --> 23:34.560]  leaders with state chosen hacks and now where they top vatican official saying those who best
[23:34.560 --> 23:41.280]  realized the social doctor of the church are the chinese and the chinese communists have done amazing
[23:41.280 --> 23:48.480]  jobs for the church that's how they plan on making it so ugly you'll go ahead and merge with ai and
[23:48.480 --> 23:54.720]  then what did shan parker talk about last year the former head of facebook what did other executives
[23:54.720 --> 24:01.040]  at facebook this year come out and say we did this to make you alone to lower your iq and to
[24:01.040 --> 24:06.960]  make you depressed and we have bots and fake people that nudge and control you socially into the
[24:06.960 --> 24:10.960]  world view we want for control and we admit this is immoral and bad
[24:10.960 --> 24:25.520]  and that's why here's nbc new york i have another one here cbs news new york no more best friends
[24:26.960 --> 24:32.160]  some schools consider banning best friends it goes on to say this is all happening it's just
[24:32.160 --> 24:34.480]  happening in europe happening all over it's a global movement
[24:34.480 --> 24:42.240]  rumor do have first started in prince george's south london school yeah tabasco institute
[24:42.240 --> 24:48.320]  the push for breakup best friends is catching on says clinical psychologist dr barbara greenberg
[24:48.320 --> 24:52.960]  yeah don't want to have people you actually count on just kind of have a bunch of friends you don't
[24:52.960 --> 24:56.800]  really know there has been a movement in some america schools and european schools to ban the
[24:56.800 --> 25:04.080]  phrase best friend oh see banning words it's not just nazi words greenberg said the idea
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.960]  banning the phrase best friends is a very intriguing social experiment
[25:12.240 --> 25:14.240]  oh you're in a social experiment see
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.720]  they want you totally alone they want your soul they want you under the screen sickness
[25:23.440 --> 25:29.840]  totally alone disassociative like a sociopath or a psychopath that artificially unable to
[25:29.840 --> 25:34.160]  communicate or interface with other people or to ever really just pay attention to what people
[25:34.160 --> 25:39.680]  are saying the attention spans are now less than a goldfish in the western world that's on record
[25:40.240 --> 25:47.440]  people can't remember stuff 10 seconds to the next 10 seconds prisoners designed by the psych
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.400]  warfare chiefs with tv in the last 70 years lowering the attention span
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.600]  so that people came to put two and two together and so you can have all the liberal leaders and
[25:59.600 --> 26:06.160]  all the different national black leaders and people calling for race war and have president obama's
[26:07.280 --> 26:12.160]  painter who did his portrait showing women's white women's heads cut off and saying it's
[26:12.160 --> 26:19.520]  part of the black royalty a black royalty of a black woman to have an arrogant insolent face
[26:19.520 --> 26:26.320]  with white women's heads cut off that's what he paints this is the total mental illness
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.720]  we're going to cover that again as i said coming up in the next segment with the vice
[26:30.720 --> 26:34.880]  clips about vacationing away from whites and then it's like whites aren't human they shouldn't
[26:34.880 --> 26:39.920]  know how to travel or live where are they getting this from the universities from the big banks
[26:39.920 --> 26:47.200]  with their agenda to totally make society and culture dysfunctional and then he's trying to
[26:47.200 --> 26:52.240]  counter it democrat corporation pressures youtube to censor content or else including info wars
[26:52.240 --> 26:59.760]  and that ties into bill gates says that they need to censor off the quote hate news when this is
[26:59.760 --> 27:08.320]  pro love news exposing the globalists and trying to fight for our humanity now we're going to go
[27:08.320 --> 27:11.520]  to break and when i come back we're going to get into the screen sickness we're going to get into
[27:11.520 --> 27:17.440]  the ai takeover we're going to get into how we can stop it by waking people up across the board
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.560]  and another way you could stop it is spreading the videos and the articles from this show they're
[27:22.560 --> 27:26.560]  fighting everywhere they can to stop you i got a whole bunch of messages here and i'll show you
[27:26.560 --> 27:30.800]  some coming up where people said that they no longer get our youtube feed and their subscription
[27:30.800 --> 27:34.800]  they don't get the facebook feed and their subscription they got to go to the site to find
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.440]  it every day they got to go to facebook my own page or youtube to find it and that's all part of
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.640]  the incremental censorship that internal documents and hidden cameras from project veritas have shown
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.320]  so again we know what they don't want getting out let's get it out and we also need your financial

[34:32.560 --> 34:40.000]  i can not be come on get down with the same this is like i can not come on get down with the same
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.560]  you know it do we if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[34:46.560 --> 35:04.160]  the admitted plan is a scientific breakaway ai civilization that is destabilizing
[35:05.040 --> 35:14.560]  the current human-based civilization ahead of the ai takeover now
[35:14.560 --> 35:20.160]  i've been retrospective quite a bit lately and i've been thinking about what have i not done
[35:20.160 --> 35:28.000]  a good job on and it's going back to in game that i made 11 years ago and other reports
[35:28.000 --> 35:35.440]  where we laid out exactly the plan word for word what is in cnbc today from dubai at the
[35:35.440 --> 35:44.800]  world government summit with top world leaders and top tech company ejects and top futurists
[35:44.800 --> 35:52.400]  saying humanity will be obsolete within 30 years we will merge with machines and everyone else will
[35:52.400 --> 36:03.440]  be exterminated now that is the plan oh but just last year the new york times said what is globalism
[36:03.440 --> 36:09.600]  the thing alex jones made up and it was a huge article saying globalism doesn't exist and jones
[36:09.600 --> 36:17.680]  is insane that's the mind trick where they're building a giant breakaway civilization i've
[36:17.680 --> 36:25.280]  probably read uh five hundred a five i don't i don't know the articles that are white papers
[36:25.280 --> 36:31.200]  written by them i've read a bunch of books they've written on it and it's the most satanic
[36:31.200 --> 36:35.520]  crap you ever read by these executives are like i will become a god and everyone else will bow
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.240]  before me and if you don't accept ai you'll i'll step on you like a bug and we're gonna blast off of
[36:40.240 --> 36:45.040]  the corners of the universe and take over and it's gonna be unspeakably great and i'm gonna
[36:45.040 --> 36:50.160]  and it's just crazy i think you read about the executives half their kids like i said end up in
[36:50.160 --> 36:54.880]  prison or committing suicide they're totally dysfunctional and crazy i'd been around some
[36:54.880 --> 37:01.360]  of them before they're clearly on some type of high-tech drugs and i mean the these people
[37:01.360 --> 37:08.000]  shouldn't be charting our course and all i'm saying is they admit the attack on the family
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.120]  all the race war crap all of it is to demoralize us and to make a future very bleak so that we
[37:17.120 --> 37:24.000]  all just give into video games tv hollywood our smartphones which they admit disassociate us from
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.720]  friends and family disassociate us from neighbors and if you just joined us i'm reading from australia
[37:30.720 --> 37:37.200]  to germany to the united states but like it's a wonderful experiment getting rid of best friends
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.320]  and maybe friends period they don't want you to have people you count on a husband or wife a best
[37:42.320 --> 37:46.720]  friend you've known since high school they don't want you to have those commitments they want you
[37:46.720 --> 37:53.840]  totally alone that's what they said they funded the whole free love thing in the 60s that's that's
[37:53.840 --> 37:58.720]  in all the white papers from the 50s uh again from the tavis talk institute and others they said
[37:58.720 --> 38:03.600]  we're gonna push free love so that people don't stay together and don't even care about their kids
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.520]  so the state can take control of the family and it doesn't mean i'm sitting here like some goody
[38:07.520 --> 38:13.600]  two shoes going you're gonna go to hell son of you have sex with that girl and look i grew up in
[38:13.600 --> 38:20.240]  all this i'm not a hypocrite and i ended up having a family and having children despite the system
[38:20.240 --> 38:26.320]  designed to keep me from doing that or to have me we actually with my children but it worked as hard
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.360]  as it could to try to stop that and still works to try to stop that and they admit their whole
[38:31.360 --> 38:36.400]  plan is you can't have a family you can't have church you can't have god member at the state of
[38:36.400 --> 38:42.560]  the union msnbc cnn they all had pundits going well what is that you don't get that anymore that's a
[38:42.560 --> 38:52.880]  bygone era yeah there's uh dw a big german news hello big brother how china controls its citizens
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.240]  their social media and if you don't behave you get banned from it and then you have a global
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.560]  score and when i mean global it's not a worldwide score it's global in all of china which now makes
[39:02.560 --> 39:09.840]  it global uh a 360 overview where that ties into all your real credit everything and if you behave well
[39:09.840 --> 39:17.120]  well then you get more little little chits in your in your in your video game it's the gulag
[39:17.120 --> 39:24.000]  archipelago meets the digital gulag and what does max keiser put it you merge a casino with
[39:24.000 --> 39:31.680]  a gulag casino gulag social credit system which blacklist citizens we first reported on that
[39:31.680 --> 39:40.720]  it's all over the news in 2018 we first reported on that paul washington did four years ago and
[39:40.720 --> 39:45.520]  they banned that article on facebook and twitter i mean they were so scared of that and if you want
[39:45.520 --> 39:51.200]  to know again why they're so scared of us we will simply go to white papers where they're getting
[39:51.200 --> 39:57.120]  it ironed out getting it ready before they roll it out ubiquitously we'll go in during beta and go
[39:57.120 --> 40:02.560]  hey this really sounds bad do you think this is a good idea they don't want your input socially
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.040]  they want to just roll out everywhere and then suddenly all the tv's are watching and listening
[40:07.040 --> 40:10.720]  to you and suddenly your kid's got a smartphone lowering their iq and they don't care about you

[40:22.000 --> 40:25.920]  you're already down with the sickness
[40:28.480 --> 40:33.360]  so when you look at facebook twitter google they're all using the chinese model and it's all
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.000]  i have bill gates today and the head of unilever saying shut down conservative media
[40:41.120 --> 40:44.400]  and then that's supposed to control you what you say and what you do or you'll be banned
[40:44.400 --> 40:49.040]  off those platforms but then pretty soon you're banned no matter what you do because it's all
[40:49.040 --> 40:55.520]  about total control to where you can't even say best friend the idea of banning the phrase best
[40:55.520 --> 41:00.960]  friend is very intriguing social experiment it's like a fun thing oh we're banning best friends
[41:00.960 --> 41:08.720]  we're not in a cult or anything oh let me show you this i mentioned it here it is obama's artist
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.320]  portrays white girl be headed by empowered black woman in four wars dot com this is the portrait
[41:14.320 --> 41:19.120]  artist for obama who he supposedly real good friends with this just marks the latest in every form
[41:19.120 --> 41:25.600]  of leftist art being supercharged with racial hatred talk about butchering a white woman uh
[41:25.600 --> 41:31.760]  i'll just butcher the name cayenne wiley uh it's like kai wiley the artist behind the new
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.800]  portrait of president obama portrayed the beheading of a white girl by a black woman 2012 with it she
[41:36.800 --> 41:43.920]  does a bunch of these or he does a bunch of these the art piece at judith beheading holo ferns
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.560]  places a woman of color specifically a black woman in the position of power and majesty
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.720]  this is so important because of the racism and sexism that women of color have historically and
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.000]  continue to face today now that's why everybody's trying to get out of africa and get over here as
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.240]  soon as possible i know everything's so horrible and here's another one here she is beheading
[42:04.240 --> 42:09.680]  here she is beheading the redhead and just look at the arrogant face they painted on this woman

[42:14.960 --> 42:19.680]  and then chopping the evil white woman's head off and then white women just grovel and beg oh
[42:19.680 --> 42:24.240]  you're right we're bad but again remember what would happen just think about it if
[42:27.360 --> 42:33.040]  trump or anybody else had someone that did their paintings and had big public events obama
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.960]  unveils it worships this guy who again most of his paintings have little sperm painted everywhere

[47:50.640 --> 47:56.160]  all right uh getting back into the open attempts to destabilize our civilization
[47:56.160 --> 48:02.160]  in the words of the world government forum world government summit that cnbc is reporting on
[48:03.120 --> 48:09.360]  there is a destabilization happening of our planet in a massive massive massive way
[48:11.360 --> 48:15.520]  so the establishment can control things and and and build the world they want
[48:15.520 --> 48:20.480]  and greedily have all the advanced technology have the life extension have it all for themselves
[48:20.480 --> 48:27.440]  and not have any pesky republics or pesky constitutional democracies getting the way of that
[48:28.880 --> 48:33.200]  and so the average man's an expert on football an expert on acting cool and acting powerful
[48:33.200 --> 48:37.920]  the average woman is an expert you know playing the victim or fighting with her female comrades
[48:38.960 --> 48:45.520]  and it's it's just a wrecked society so we have obama's portrait artist talking about the royalty
[48:45.520 --> 48:52.240]  of a black woman showing supremacy by killing white people and severing their heads which
[48:52.240 --> 48:59.760]  i'll assure you is going on in africa uh black on black so it is it is bizarre that the west has
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.120]  this idea of itself is bad we then take the position that we're inherently evil but everyone else
[49:05.120 --> 49:11.760]  who's not white is inherently good and then we wonder we have some video of this of why people
[49:11.760 --> 49:18.160]  like president obama would pick a portrait artist and have a big press conference when it's known
[49:18.160 --> 49:25.200]  going back to 2012 that he painted a series of paintings showing white women having their heads
[49:25.200 --> 49:32.080]  cut off as an act of racial superiority and supremacy imagine if we should photoshop this
[49:32.880 --> 49:38.960]  with the head of obama or excuse me the head of trump and then it's the head of obama in the hand
[49:38.960 --> 49:44.560]  i want to do that right now not that i want trump to cut obama's head off i want to put it side by
[49:44.560 --> 49:50.880]  side and say you know with a shot of obama with the portrait unveiling yesterday a screenshot
[49:51.440 --> 49:59.680]  saying obama's artists obama's portrait artist paints black women murdering white women and then
[49:59.680 --> 50:06.240]  next to it have that and then say imagine if trump did something like that and have trump's head on the
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.840]  woman with obama's head in his hand now i don't want any violence against president obama turn
[50:11.840 --> 50:17.600]  him into a martyr god no i'm saying i want to illustrate and and they'll probably attack us
[50:17.600 --> 50:22.720]  and no one media matters and that nazi collaborator george soros they'll clip just the image i'm
[50:22.720 --> 50:29.120]  predicting this they will clip just the image of trump's head on the black woman cutting the white
[50:29.120 --> 50:34.960]  woman's head off but we'll reverse the heads we'll show obama no we'll show michelle obama's head
[50:34.960 --> 50:41.440]  getting cut off and we'll show trump doing it or malania doing it that's even better we'll have
[50:41.440 --> 50:46.720]  malania cutting michelle's head off and again i don't want that to happen i'm totally against this
[50:46.720 --> 50:52.720]  but this is who the president the former president for elected by white people in record numbers the
[50:52.720 --> 50:58.080]  same white demographic that elected trump just want change and freedom and getting along they sit
[50:58.080 --> 51:04.880]  there think about this let's put that back on screen please imagine this this particular photo
[51:04.880 --> 51:09.600]  right here with the black lady cutting the redhead's head off imagine if you stuck malania trump's
[51:09.600 --> 51:18.320]  head on that black woman and then stuck michelle obama's head in the hand can you i mean it'd be
[51:18.320 --> 51:27.360]  civil war it'd be the end of the world so to cause debate i want to get the entire graphics
[51:27.360 --> 51:32.640]  department on this right now and again people get what i want we're going to show the screenshot of
[51:32.640 --> 51:36.640]  what i'm about to put on screen for tv viewers obama yes they had the unveiling of this
[51:40.400 --> 51:46.720]  and then you'll say here is the artist that obama had to his portrait who paints paintings like this
[51:47.600 --> 51:51.920]  showing black women cutting white women's heads off as part of black empowerment's what he says
[51:51.920 --> 51:58.640]  part of the royalty and say imagine if the roles were reversed like this and show the image of
[51:58.640 --> 52:09.120]  malania trump cutting the head off of michael obama excuse me michelle obama imagine that again
[52:09.120 --> 52:15.120]  that that is and i don't want that but i have to do that at info wars to illustrate but see they'll
[52:15.120 --> 52:19.760]  say oh we're censoring that hate image we're censoring that we're gonna say we're gonna kill
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.600]  you we're gonna push all this we're gonna engage in all this behavior but you can't even point out
[52:25.600 --> 52:31.040]  what we're doing is hypocritical because that's how they operate with the censorship it is incredible
[52:32.160 --> 52:36.640]  now speaking of that this is a vice program that aired last wednesday i happen to see it
[52:37.600 --> 52:42.160]  and send it over i'm glad it was big national news story about this weekend but uh we would
[52:42.160 --> 52:45.520]  have had this story first it's not a big deal it's just now it's a big national news story
[52:45.520 --> 52:50.480]  and i'm glad uh but but i guess i dropped the ball uh but now today we're gonna get to it
[52:50.480 --> 52:55.760]  this is just three minutes out of vice we're gonna analyze and give critique to no whites allowed
[52:57.680 --> 53:01.920]  now a lot of universities already have segregation again and then days a week where
[53:01.920 --> 53:05.440]  whites aren't allowed or whites aren't allowed on this area or that area and it's usually run by
[53:05.440 --> 53:10.960]  white women but uh this is the hypocrisy the racism the bizarreness the mental illness in my view
[53:11.600 --> 53:15.120]  these women in Costa Rica bitching about the country that helps them have this much money to
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.120]  go do retreats and they're there uh saying that whites don't deserve to have passports
[53:19.120 --> 53:23.120]  whites are inherently evil here's some excerpts of that right now
[53:24.720 --> 53:31.200]  Alexis Bromley is from Nebraska she needed a break from white people in Omaha it's very
[53:31.200 --> 53:36.960]  segregated it's hard in Nebraska because it's a red state and so you just don't know who you
[53:36.960 --> 53:42.480]  interact with on a daily basis if they believe that you're lesser if you're inferior and how that
[53:42.480 --> 53:48.240]  in turn can affect me so she decided to go on a women of color healing retreat in Costa Rica
[53:48.240 --> 53:55.920]  my blackness is bold my blackness is uninhibited my blackness is strength this retreat is one of
[53:55.920 --> 54:00.080]  more than a dozen black-owned travel groups marketing trips specifically to people who
[54:00.080 --> 54:06.240]  look like Alexis yeah not every woman can afford to go to Costa Rica what can we do for the racism
[54:06.240 --> 54:10.240]  they experience for women who can't afford to be part of your retreat i think that it's important
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.960]  for people in the united states black and poc people to start forming their own spaces there
[54:14.960 --> 54:22.400]  what having white people on this trip ruin it i don't think we will be as open and as honest as we
[54:22.960 --> 54:29.440]  are with the group that we're in now yeah for black we knew that racism has been around but it's
[54:29.440 --> 54:35.120]  a bit more in our face now it's made me have to pivot my interactions with people and like by the
[54:35.120 --> 54:42.480]  way let's hit pause for a moment please they're pushing this like it's normal and like it's a
[54:42.480 --> 54:46.800]  good thing and you've got women going i don't want to be around white so they may think i'm
[54:46.800 --> 54:53.120]  inferior the colleges and the media have created a total mental illness where no amount of white
[54:53.120 --> 54:58.160]  groveling and laying on their bellies will ever make these spoiled women who are out there lavishing
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.720]  themselves uh you know when half the people on the planet can't even have a vacation once in their
[55:02.720 --> 55:08.320]  life totally bitching about how whites are inherently evil when it's white people that
[55:08.320 --> 55:14.560]  began to end slavery worldwide and less than two percent of white people in the united states at
[55:14.560 --> 55:24.640]  the end of slavery in 1868 ever had slaves two percent of whites had slaves from 1868 backward
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.320]  most of the white people in america came after that more than double quite frankly and you always
[55:32.320 --> 55:35.760]  read about eastern europeans getting beaten up or killed in different cities because they're white
[55:35.760 --> 55:40.080]  because they own slaves each europeans had no connection anything it's just total mental
[55:40.080 --> 55:47.440]  patient land let's continue with this quacky behavior i can't trust you on friendship level
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.680]  family level any level if you actually are supporting someone that you know that's that's
[55:51.680 --> 55:56.000]  true racism right there you feel like you've increasingly lost the ability to see any shot at
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.640]  a relationship with white people every time i have a conversation with them i just pick up on
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.720]  certain things that they say whatever i pick up on the microaggression the passive aggressiveness
[56:04.720 --> 56:09.600]  i pick up on it so i decided one day to just eliminate white people for my personal life
[56:09.600 --> 56:15.840]  and ever since then my life has been way all right pause again you know she decided to eliminate
[56:15.840 --> 56:22.000]  white people and that's her right to do it but but i mean here's the deal you're you're trying to
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.840]  give everybody a serious tip on their shoulder that's going to ruin their lives and and and
[56:27.840 --> 56:32.240]  folks this is the globalist answer to bring everybody down no one will be able to stand up
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.960]  against ai no one will stand up against any of this because humanity will be so turned against
[56:36.960 --> 56:41.520]  itself this is psychological warfare let's continue i feel like white people shouldn't even have
[56:41.520 --> 56:47.040]  passports because they've done enough that especially white americans leave them in the united states
[56:47.040 --> 56:51.440]  they do not need to come here they do not they should be even able to travel they need to stay
[56:51.440 --> 56:55.120]  in the united states but do a white person who's doing their best to be the best white person
[56:55.120 --> 57:02.880]  they can be i have no choice for a white person my tip to white people is to let us have our space
[57:02.880 --> 57:08.400]  let us have our room and go hang out with other white people we're okay you know you've done
[57:08.400 --> 57:14.000]  enough damage 20 minutes down the road andrea and a business partner have quietly invested nearly
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.880]  a hundred thousand dollars to build up their own private retreat space this is where we'll have
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.760]  the workshops i love how most these women look they're about 80 percent white to start building
[57:23.760 --> 57:28.880]  your own black nation out in the middle of history then they learn they leased it from a white person

[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:08.400]  you are funding the information war in 2018 you are listening to an info wars dot com front line
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.200]  report if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:29.280]  from deep in the heart of fema region six austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.400]  all right we've got clips from the senate intelligence committee today with the total
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:43.600]  hysteria by mark warner about how trump is a russian agent because he won't endorse the
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.480]  fake russia gate narrative and then won't say that bot stole the election for him when you have all
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.480]  the globalists and their bots a hundred thousand times than they ever heard about with the russians
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.400]  that's coming up but to illustrate if you just joined us the technocracy means a rule by
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:09.040]  technological elites using computers and technology to carry out an authoritarian system
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.600]  that's the definition technocracies an authoritarian system of technocrats ruling over you and
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.880]  they're everything to do is to demoralize to dumb down to sabotage to confuse because if humanity
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:31.520]  ever gets together about big goals like life extension like ending war like expanding
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:39.760]  so if we ever get together if we ever come together and understand what the globalists have done
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.600]  and realize they've walled us off to a certain extent and have their breakaway civilization
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:49.680]  it's game over but that's why they're trying to ban humans in the military they're trying to sabotage
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:55.760]  it with all the uh trans movement and all the rest of it that's why they're trying to ban football
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:03.040]  because you can't have something where you're put at risk because if a plant doesn't have rain on it
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.840]  and wind on it and doesn't have any atmosphere on it it's like bubble boy first time you run into a
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:14.880]  microbe you die and so they want you totally domesticated totally alone not allowed to
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.520]  have any friends and they admit even in bloomberg a few years ago that okay a bunch of countries
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:26.720]  in europe now have unelected leaders called technocrats so they're very brazen about it but
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.760]  where are the apologies where are the oh alex shows was right when cnbc reports world government
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:37.280]  summit in dubei they've decided to phase out humans and merge with machines that's what world leaders
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.800]  agreed to that's what the future is say it's where we're going and to not be overtaken by machines
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.720]  you've got to merge with it right now put that smartphone in your head you know if you're not
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:55.520]  falling maybe in the background without the audio roll that sickness video we put together
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:00.240]  come down with the sickness where it shows people walking in the middle of streets
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.320]  getting hit by cars falling into fountains with their smartphones just staring at them
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:13.120]  totally plugged in and then the numbers show it lower iq less friends no real human interaction
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.200]  because it's like a video game you're playing where you're constantly trying to get your friends to
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.680]  click on your video and to pay attention to it but none of it even matters because nobody's even
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:28.960]  really living and then shan parker says oh we designed this to enslave you and steve jobs wouldn't
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:35.360]  let his children have iPhones bill gates wouldn't let his son touch a computer or or any type of
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.360]  ipad or or anything till 13 and then it was very limited but they push it on your kids in
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:44.480]  preschool
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:51.040]  everything is about self-destructive behavior everything is about controlling you
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.240]  but meanwhile you've got
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:06.160]  barack obama and the white house portrait here portrait master he hired who's a well-known
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.520]  black supremacist who says that we need to kill white people need to show everything killed to
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:18.480]  show the the royalty of blacks and black women and their power over whites i'm showing images
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.120]  of this imagine if anybody else hired somebody to do something like this instead they're looking
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:34.240]  for phantom racism instead they're looking for phantom garbage like this and see Mcbrane put
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.520]  together a little piece for watching on tv where we took the real portrait event
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:47.440]  and or or nathan did one of the graphics people and put this together showing a hammer and sickle
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:56.400]  and a pentagram and once they've done that you're saying oh well you altered it no
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.600]  is it satanic to show black women cutting white people's heads off and saying someone is inherently
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.480]  evil just because of the way they look or what group they come from that's the opposite of what
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.600]  martin luther king said everybody thought michelle obama looked great in her painting she doesn't
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:18.240]  look like like a man there she looks she looks like a woman but let's roll like i planned earlier
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.720]  since i mentioned that uh the the they live piece we're going to do it last segment then last
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.520]  segment then last segment we're going to do it now uh as we plan to do because then you've got they
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:34.560]  live uh where if you sit there and you actually think about what they're doing you just consciously
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:40.080]  put the glasses on you can understand the larger paradigm and the larger program of what they've
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:45.040]  got planned for you and your family now that said you've got this
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:55.120]  racist hired to do the painting and it's not even a news issue it's not even a news item
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:03.840]  but then sessions invokes anglo-american heritage of the america's sheriffs and the media flips
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.040]  out saying its code word for racism despite the fact the supreme court everybody else constantly
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.440]  uses that quote just like saying judo christian because the old testament's jewish the new testament
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:21.680]  is the new testament christian judo christian it's like saying french and spanish and italian
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:31.360]  are romantic languages meaning rom romantic languages but again people think the word homosexual
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:39.360]  heterosexual is hurtful they think the word um caucasoid they think the word negroid is evil
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.920]  words that are just scientific terms caucasoid means from the caucas mountains the other
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.560]  scientific terms have nothing racist about them they're just simply scientific words but if they
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:58.560]  can get you to hate any type of science they've got control of you and this is their plan so sessions
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.120]  invokes this and i'm not even defending sessions these but he's rolled over to the globalist this
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:09.040]  is something routinely done because we have the magna carta 1215 we have locals getting control
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.680]  and not just having dukes and urls and and lords who had total control of your life wanted sex with
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:23.200]  your wife wanted to kill you it was up to them and so in comes the magna carta and the anglo
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:29.840]  american heritage when they say anglo they mean the anglo saxon slash american heritage
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.080]  of due process of juries of constables of sheriffs elected by the people instead of a king
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.920]  it's the world process that led to the renaissance away from that in this compendium so let's go
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:48.720]  ahead and play that clip so i want to close by reiterating my deep appreciation for frown thanks
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:56.160]  to the many women of law enforcement to me personally that you've given to me uh and i want to thank
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:04.320]  every sheriff in america since our founding the independently elected sheriff has been the people's
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.360]  protector uh who keeps law enforcement close to and accountable to people through the elected
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:20.080]  process the office of sheriff is a critical part of the anglo american heritage of law enforcement
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:28.160]  we must never erode this historic office i know this you know this we want to be partners we don't
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:34.800]  want to be bosses we want to strengthen you and help you be more effective in your work so that's
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:39.680]  a very federalist speech the federal government is here the federal system you think it was being

[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.560]  idiot they think it wastes time trying to educate us or get us on the right path so they just
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:47.840]  engage in every evil imaginable and see us as animals of course they're already animals so
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:53.280]  they're trying to turn us into what they are and i've got a whole stack of news on this front
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.640]  coming up the next segment european politicians want to admit the west is in a state of war
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.720]  says security analysts on national check television well that's because they understand
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:11.440]  you're in a state of war and they've engineered the war to bring down europe and they won't tell you
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:18.720]  that that's the plan so even people that are somewhat awake they think the other side doesn't
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:26.560]  know they're fully conscious that's the issue and then as i mentioned mark warner hypes russian
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:32.480]  hysteria and i know i'm sick of the russian stuff too but it's a real fight they're using this to
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.920]  censor the internet to censor info wars to censor you now millions of people have gotten letters
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:45.520]  from twitter saying you're a russian agent better watch it that's a very aggressive act
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.440]  and they have all these big corporations saying we're going to censor everybody
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:55.440]  that is a big existential threat to all of our freedom we need congressional hearings we need
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.000]  demonstrations out front google and all these places we need to get aggressive
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.080]  they're running around trying to stop me being able to publish a book with neil Strauss
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:14.240]  this is what they do these are horrible people these are the bad guys these are the chinese
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.040]  tanks coming in to crush the pro free speech rallies in tianaman square in 1989 but now
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:25.040]  they claim we are the bad guys our speech is the tanks their tanks is the freedom
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.360]  that's their upside down world so that's coming up
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:36.080]  but right now let's go to your phone calls we've got kevin and fairy and jay and george and andre
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:45.760]  and victor and josh and loy and cj and sam and so many let's go to sam in oklahoma he wants to
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.880]  talk about the articles on worldnetdaily.com it's an info wars.com link to it you have to
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:57.840]  read the quotes the pope said communist china defines dignity and humanity and catholicism
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.920]  so communist chinese mass murder killing christians killing buddhists
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.160]  the communist pope says this defines it i mean is that not the sickest joke you ever heard sam
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:18.000]  yes alex the news in china and the news in costa rica about the cult down there really go together
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.560]  uh i also noticed that earlier in the week you brought up that the european union was
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:30.240]  originally called the treaty of roam starting in 1952 that's a various student a correct observation
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.400]  as far as china back in the 1950s cardinal beyer informed alberto revera teaching him in
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:48.160]  roam as a young jesuit acolyte that the catholic church controlled china from right there in roam and
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:54.720]  now we're seeing that after uh decades of masking that uh there's a final union between the state
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:00.800]  church and the communist party well i used to read that and hear that i think it was crazy
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:08.560]  20 years ago and now undoubtedly the the roman church is a hundred percent at the top global
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:15.920]  is run now and is antithetical to any christian belief system whatsoever i mean the pope has
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:22.880]  put out public statements saying communist china is the example for us all now if that doesn't
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.920]  tell you we got issue i mean they sell political dissidents organs it's hell on earth
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.240]  anything else sir yes alex i absolutely agree with that the book of revelation talks about
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:44.320]  the beast and the false prophet and now with this turnover and the jesuit pope taking over
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.000]  there are actually two popes which could fulfill that uh prophecy about the beast and the false
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.720]  prophet if we look at the book of revelation it really talks a lot about the mother of harlots
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.760]  as the roman church and this is why cults spin off from places where romanism is very strong
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.280]  like in the banana republics in costa rica i have preached in costa rica myself and what i found
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:14.080]  was secularism is very strong secularism also which is kind of the religion of europe at this point
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.840]  is a harlot daughter of the catholic church and it's something that they've done intentionally
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.280]  oh there's no doubt that leftist took over the catholic church and i'm not saying it
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:29.280]  had done problems before and now completely run it and but the methodist church all of it
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.760]  i've been to some of these churches and it's like take money up for billa melinda gates and i mean
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:40.480]  it's just like what and they're taking the crosses out of the churches it's it's crazy it's very very
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:48.240]  sad sam but this pope this pope is is completely uncloaked i mean i'd surprise he doesn't pull
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.280]  his skin off and he's got horns and a tail i mean he's that he might say satanism is the
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:59.600]  greatest form of christianity because when you say that communist china is the ultimate
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:06.080]  form of christianity that is insane thank you for calling sam let's talk to victor in florida victor
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:13.840]  you're calling go ahead yes uh hi alex all right so first i want to start off by mentioning
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.160]  two things before i go into the the main thing here first i just want to mention if people
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:28.480]  just go and try the products they will be ordering all the time i've ordered several
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:35.120]  of the products over and over because it's amazing in particular silver bullet i as soon as i start

[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.760]  fund the whole operation because a very small percentage of people buy products and a very
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.480]  small percentage of them buy a lot of the products so thank you but yes we set out to whatever the
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:45.920]  very best in the industry is get it private label it or redevelop it and discount it and so that's
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.160]  what we do so thank you so much we want this stuff to really work well for people obviously so they
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.920]  keep buying it again but when you uh when you mentioned the uh the silver bullet colloidal
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.320]  silver it's got thousands of reviews a 98 percent review it is our highest reviewed product because
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.400]  it is from the top lab in the country discounted high quality colloidal silver and it's not a
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.880]  silver bullet but the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet uh so god bless you

[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.960]  call then i'll go back to your calls after i cover it trump channels ran paul during military
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:50.080]  meetings and they've released some transcripts of what he's saying and it's absolutely dead on
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.160]  so i'm going to read some of those transcripts coming up here in a moment and then tie that into
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:00.080]  this and again i just go off the facts never been to russia not arousal file i know the globalists
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:06.480]  put the marxist in there and put the whole lininistic system in there in 1917 just like they're
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.680]  trying to do here very same globalist grandchildren today are doing this to us dutch foreign minister
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:16.240]  resides at remitting lie about putin meeting he's been caught they can timestamp and prove
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:23.120]  that he never met with putin and made it up that putin said he wanted a greater russia
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:33.040]  so there you go they even had people in georgia try to remerge with russia they're like no no no
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:40.800]  thanks we don't want that so it's it's just crazy that's right dutch foreign minister resides
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.720]  the line about putin meeting this is what they're supposed to do because they're all globalists
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:51.840]  selling their countries out russia's not selling russia out that's why the globalists hate him and
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.800]  it's the same thing trump doesn't want to do that but he's surrounded by people that won't carry out
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:00.160]  his directives we're talking about that in a moment but finishing up here with a
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:07.440]  interesting caller victor in florida uh go ahead sir okay so yeah so i um i just also want to
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:13.920]  mention to you i know that you guys are going to expand so um just in my personal uh journey
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:21.280]  into being awakened because at one point in time um i i i was actually a libtard you know and
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:27.040]  that i was awakened my brother actually which is a former marine i used to listen to you and i
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.400]  you know used to think oh you know he's just he's just brainwashed but i then i realized i was the
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:38.720]  one that was brainwashed and what i'm trying to get at is i would i couldn't sleep at night and i
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:45.120]  would stay up watching all these videos um with you on there and just different things on youtube
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:51.120]  you know and i couldn't fall asleep so i hope that when you expand you put a show sometime
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:56.640]  at that late night time because then it's live and people get to see you know people that are
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:01.920]  i totally agree and again it's about putting an infrastructure um it's about getting people
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.600]  hired that can run live shows six about four or five people run a show we got like seven or eight
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.560]  right now because we're training everybody on my show but we've got the new crews and then another
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.920]  wave of crews are going to come in after that but within three or four months we're going to be ready
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:20.880]  and i totally agree a lot of people want you know to have us uh you at least up till midnight every
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.800]  night and i like coast to coast we wouldn't be competition against them they have like 60 percent
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.640]  of the stations at night we're not trying to go into that market that's not what we're targeting
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:33.040]  i go on george's show all the time it's just that i just don't see that we can break into a market
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:39.040]  they totally dominate uh you know basically midnight till four a.m so that's not really our
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:44.560]  target area we might go to one a.m and then come back at six i think i i just think that kind of
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.560]  one to six that five hours is an area uh that we're not going to do uh but uh we may just have
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.600]  kind of somebody that picks the best things of the day and kind of for those hours there's that
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:01.040]  but you're absolutely right up until midnight or one o'clock central 11 o'clock you know specific
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.640]  we really need to do that and you're absolutely right here's the issue and i'm having a meeting
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:13.200]  about this today with with our reporters and they're all great people we get sent classified stuff all
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:19.280]  the time and when i get sent classified stuff hey i got a double check it's classified that that takes
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:29.040]  some work okay then i have to decide is this illegal what people are doing and if it is illegal
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:35.200]  i have to then call the fbi which i mean we do quite often and i'll contact the person that
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.280]  sends me the info and say you know i've got to go to the fbi with us uh is that what you want are
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.240]  you going to contact them a lot of times they go i'll contact them uh i mean we're running a real
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:53.360]  news organization here so what's killing me is actually trying to drink the great lake uh of
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:38:04.800]  information with a little pixie straw that's what's frustrating that's what's hard that's what really
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.840]  makes me want to pull my hair out because we can't let me tell you you could have a thousand
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:17.200]  analysts trying to get the intel we've got and doing knowing what to do with it i mean i've had
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.560]  a lot of stuff go on i'll just leave it that just the last week where it's
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:37.520]  it's like a james bond movie but it's not fun and it's because they know the military's listening
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.600]  and the globalists are obsessed with this show because they know their own people are listening
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.080]  the general public kind of tunes and it goes oh is this real is this not the establishment tunes in
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:53.440]  and the white house listens a lot of the stuff and
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:03.440]  my problem is i have reporters come to me they go look we got this guy inside this organization
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:11.760]  he says this this and that and he's he's sending us this and i look at it and i just know that it's
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.840]  a time bomb and that you're not it's very questionable whether you're even supposed to have that information
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.840]  especially when it's private it's one thing if it's government you can argue whistleblower
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:30.640]  protection when it's private stuff it just goes in a shredder and i'm like delete it delete it
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.960]  delete it delete it and it's not like i'm even covering stuff up i can't deal with it okay and
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.280]  i've had the experiences where i don't go with my gut and i go go ahead and run with that and then
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:47.760]  it creates situations where this whole operation can be shut down we don't even need more information
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.880]  at this point we don't need more secret intel or more wiki leaks or more we and and and we do
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:59.040]  want all that and people should send us their information it's just then i go through the
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.640]  process of people like well why aren't we going to cover this well because there's certain things
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:10.480]  like attorney client privilege there's certain things like national security there's certain
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:16.080]  things like with great power comes great responsibilities all i'm trying to get at and
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.800]  migrate frustration is i know a lot of stuff other people don't know and i don't mean bs intelligence
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:27.600]  which is mainly just echo chamber propaganda some of the most propagandized grips or intelligence
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:32.320]  agencies and militaries and corporations i mean real information because i have other sources
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:37.280]  and i can add it to a whole spectrum of analysis and other data points that nexus in and a human
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.560]  algorithm we are supercomputers and then you have a prime approximation of that being an accurate
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:51.680]  data point that we could then talk about it's just no we're not bitching or complaining
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:58.480]  we're trying to serve you as best we can because we're serving each other and i like in it to growing
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:04.720]  up we're reading a book when i was a kid i forget the name of the book my grandma was reading it to
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.400]  me my mom's mom it's the story of a little mexican farmer a kid that lived outside a big
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.680]  volcano and he grew up a teenager the volcano never had smoke coming out of it and then one
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:22.080]  day it woke up and a week later it exploded and covered his whole farm with lava and he barely
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:29.840]  escaped it was a story of just the volcano the volcano started in his coffee field that's right
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.720]  then just suddenly built up and then blew up the point is is that it's the same thing with
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:40.560]  this north korea situation we're sitting here with this time bomb and for whatever reason i'm like oh
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:48.080]  the deputy director of the cia wants me to know that north korea is planning to strike
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.800]  japan at the end of march early april
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.440]  and then what is the point of telling me that well people just want you to know and you can
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.640]  say it if you want you know it becomes like uh and then these are real sources telling me this
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:10.480]  this is real and then at the certain point i'm i can't even figure this out anymore so all i know
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:16.080]  is it's like we're growing up next to a volcano that hasn't erupted it's just a mountain we climb
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:20.400]  around on and then one day it's got hot lava shooting out the top of it and then it explodes like
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:26.320]  mount st helens so that's where we all are and we're it's all above our pay grade anybody that
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:32.080]  thinks they're in control is a liar stuff's crazy you hear what i'm saying victor yeah and and that's
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:38.240]  actually one of i kind of wanted to talk about um remember the uh that nuke that went missing
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:47.440]  out of nowhere out of a bay yes mine at my not uh yeah yeah so i was wondering if hold on we'll come

[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:22.160]  so there you go now i want to get into this report here trump's channels ran paul during
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:26.480]  military meetings i mentioned last segment then back to your calls but right now let's
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.040]  finish up with victor in florida victor sorry you got caught off again go ahead and finish your point
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:38.560]  no problem so yes i just wanted to mention that that milk that went missing i feel i feel it in
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:46.160]  my gut that they the globalists are kind of holding on to that as a last-ditch effort and and and i
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:52.400]  think that if they end up using it i mean i mean this is it would be obviously so tragic
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:59.760]  but they will blame it i think on north korea or russia you know as a you know and i think that
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:08.960]  that could potentially be the next huge false flag because it you know they need i totally agree
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:14.400]  with you i think there's nothing the globalists won't do including uh you know detonating a cruise
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.520]  missile nuke they've stolen don't forget off of the air force base in west texas they had a
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.320]  bunch of hidden nuke shop there we had high level sources and that was a four or five years ago they
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.560]  got caught smuggling a mountain hiding them somewhere that all blew up huge and the day
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:34.000]  after we reported it lindsay graham said you know that a nuke might blow up charleston so
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:42.000]  that was real that those reports we got were real from the base that was a standoff with a security
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.960]  from the base and the top general had to come down and sign off left the 18 wheelers with the
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.520]  nukes the secret nukes roll on on the highway there is a lot of craziness going on god bless
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:58.240]  you victor great points let's get to this article then back to your calls to get daniel's article
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:02.720]  on news wars dot com and info wars dot com and people that attack trump saying he's this big
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:07.680]  hawk he's very pragmatic if somebody's threatening the u.s. he'll stand up to him but he was against
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:15.440]  the first uh the second gulf ward 2003 trump channels ran paul during military meetings
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:23.520]  president growing more libertarian as uh the battle with a swamp intensifies president trump
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:29.280]  sounds a lot like rand paul or even his father ron paul during military meetings by asking generals
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:34.000]  why they won't bring the troops home which is why he wants to have the parade yeah bring some
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.280]  troops home then then have the parade and declare the military is now back under us control not
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.800]  under globalist control as it was becoming that's another reason to have the parade this according
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:50.240]  to a source in the washington post which tried to smear the president as impulsive yet reading
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.120]  deeper into the article reveals the president leans libertarian when it comes to foreign policy
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.000]  more so than previously known well i think was actually known but yes this confirms it more
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.200]  the problem is is the washington post is such fake news who knows but this is the kind of
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:09.200]  stuff he said before so i didn't believe it for one thing the president wonders why the us is in
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:15.040]  somalia of all places he has repeatedly pressed madis and McMaster in stark terms to express
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:20.240]  and explain why us troops are in somalia somalia can't we just pull out he has asked according to us
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:25.760]  officials and trump questions us involvement in afghanistan which is now the country's longest
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:31.440]  war in a meeting with his top national security aides the president re frustrated quote you guys
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.840]  want me to send troops everywhere trump said according to officials in the situation remaining
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:42.560]  what's the justification won't you just love these leaks sir we're doing to prevent a bomb
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:47.760]  going off in time square madis replied the response anger trump insisted madis could
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:52.080]  make the same argument about almost any country on the planet according to washington post
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:58.480]  madis told trump to embrace the status quo of wartime president like the previous two administrations
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:05.760]  sounds like madis needs to go if the public wanted expanded wars in somalia in afghanistan
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.240]  two countries with vast majority of americans have never been to they would have given hillary a
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:16.880]  landslide win i am barring people from those countries which the president's done remember
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:21.440]  the u.s airstrike on a syrian airfield that made trump appear aggressive that strike was the most
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:25.600]  limited military option presented trump according to the new york times and it effectively neutered
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:30.560]  trump's enemies at the time who were presenting him and pressuring him to go to war well this is
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:37.680]  an endorsement of the strike it did kill a syrian pilot it is worth uh pointing out that the attack
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.960]  left the runway unharmed meaning that the airbase was left operational for syria to continue strikes
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:49.760]  on isis it's as if trump wanted to appear he would wage war while maintaining some other strength
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:55.600]  of senator rand paul powerful little article by kit daniels let's get it out to everybody
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:03.280]  because that's dead on to what trump's all about and that's what he's dealing with ladies and
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:07.760]  gentlemen that's why the globalists are so upset because they want to use the u.s as an engine of
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:15.520]  global domination let's go ahead and go to loyde in washington you're on the air thanks for holding

[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:29.440]  by the way there's the big firestorm as the national portrait gallery artists hired by
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:34.560]  obama is well known for being a black supremacist that calls for black women to be royal and to
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:39.840]  assess their royalty by chopping white women's heads off and he paints all of that those articles
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.560]  are up on info wars dot com we can throw that up on screen for tb viewers so i know it sounds
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:52.880]  completely uh and totally unbelievable but now uh there is a new controversy and i remember reading
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:01:00.240]  about this a year ago when he was chosen and this has been in the mainstream news uh obama
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:06.240]  portrait shock president covered in sperm uh this artist is obsessed with sperm all of his paintings
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:11.680]  have sperm swimming all over everything so i've told kit to take the question mark off it's admittedly
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:17.760]  that he paints sperm everywhere and the word is him and obama are really good friends and so here's
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:27.280]  a giant sperm swimming across the president's head uh he also um shows the president has six
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:35.200]  fingers uh in the national portrait so there is the sperm the head of the sperm but this is a gmo
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:41.280]  sperm it wouldn't even have a tailor be able to swim so uh these are fully formed sperm that he has
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:48.000]  you can see the sperm uh he they're swimming as well so that is in your face that is you see what
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.800]  doesn't make sense it's so degenerate it's a religion of degeneracy it's what globalism is it's
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:02:02.960]  what satanism is so there you go president obama covered in sperm in new national portrait
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:10.560]  and it's all part of the joke in your face because they don't want upright strength they want
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:14.880]  that everything be a ritual of abomination
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:25.200]  jay in toronto thanks for holding your own the year go ahead hey alex i'll make it quick i know you
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.880]  have uh your you're awesome go ahead i want to say first off i think you should shake
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.320]  when the hand i saw the video where they were spitting on him and i don't know how he kept
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:42.080]  his composure and how he didn't react that's just amazing i would never have been able to do that so
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:48.480]  as one guy i think you got to shake his head for doing that um moving on i wanted to say that
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:53.520]  you know last week you had a guest on who was talking about the situation where america has an
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:03.040]  option between china and pakistan or russia and india and different global alliances it's it's
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:10.000]  it's it's it's russia with india with japan with the us with the uk versus the other alliance
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:17.440]  yes but i want to say that um you know so i'm south asian i'm a thief so i come from um that region
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:23.840]  of the world and india is not a safe place for christians um one of the most dangerous places
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:30.960]  for christians is actually india the prime minister of india modi he himself imposed a law where it's
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:37.760]  illegal to change religions into christianity so if you're a hindu and your lower caste hindu
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:43.920]  you cannot convert christianity unless you get permission so it's uh you know like and i understand
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.640]  you know the enemy of my enemy becomes my friend no i understand india's got its own problems but
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:52.640]  i mean and but haven't you had like a hundred and something million hindus have been killed by
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:58.960]  islamists in the last 1400 years right well there's been a lot of problems with islam coming in but
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:04.080]  then again there's also been problems with buddhism and sorry hindu's attacking buddhists so what
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:09.920]  happened was afghanistan was initially buddhist that's why the taliban had destroyed the buddhist
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:15.120]  sculptures that were that's right um what happened was and describe briefly then who the
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:20.560]  Sikhs are and how they had to basically become militarized just to survive yeah so and again
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:24.160]  like this isn't about specific religions it's about the leaders of that time of those religions
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:28.640]  let's just clarify you know i don't know sure i understand religion right um so what happened
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:35.120]  was when hindus made the buddhist switch over to hinduism they were kind of resenting that and
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:41.520]  afghanistan became hinduism once more and then when islam came they then used that religion as a
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:46.640]  form of conquering india and at that point the muslims are coming into india and they're forcefully
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:50.880]  converting muslims or sorry hindus into islam i had to put you on hold and get your number you
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.360]  should come on as a guest at the top of this i know it's really complex that's amazing jay but we
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:05:02.240]  gotta get his number introducing cell force by info wars life cell force focuses on mitochondria
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:08.320]  efficiency and protection mitochondria produce over 95 percent of your energy they are your body's
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:14.560]  cellular engines cell force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:19.760]  much like a cellular engine overhaul because when your mitochondria don't run at 100 percent
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:25.920]  efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen species top scientists agree that aging
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:33.200]  is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species the antioxidants
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:38.880]  found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market the stronger the antioxidant
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:44.240]  the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals

[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:14.560]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:23.360]  we all know and we've discussed this at length in recent years we've also seen the rise of nations
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.560]  who view themselves at least as competitors if not as adversaries of the united states
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:38.720]  they began to use utilize new asymmetric weapons to undercut our democratic institutions
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:44.480]  to steal our most sensitive intellectual property let me start with russia
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:51.280]  obviously certain questions remain with respect to the true extent of the russian interference
[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:56.800]  in the 2016 elections and we'll work through these continue work through these in a bipartisan
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:04.880]  way on this committee however i think you'll find a broad bipartisan consensus on this committee
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:11.360]  on a number of critical issues first that russia engaged in a coordinated attack
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:18.000]  undermine our democracy second that effort included targeting of state and local elections
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:25.920]  electoral activities in 21 states and third the russian effort in a new area
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:32.560]  utilized our social media platforms to push and spread misinformation at an unprecedented scale
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:39.760]  now we've had more than a year to get our act together and address the threat posed by russia
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:48.560]  and implement a strategy to deter further attacks but i believe unfortunately we still don't have
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:55.760]  a comprehensive plan two weeks ago director palm pale publicly stated he had as every expectation
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:03.200]  that russia will try to influence our upcoming elections secretary of state tillerson just last
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:09.920]  week said that we're already seeing russian efforts the medal in the 2018 elections but i believe in
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:17.120]  many ways we're no better prepared than we were in 2016 make no mistake this threat did not begin
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:22.800]  in 2016 and it certainly didn't end with the election what we are seeing is a continuous
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:28.560]  assault by russia to target and undermine our democratic institutions and they're going to
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:36.720]  keep coming at us despite all this the president inconveniently continues to deny the threat posed
[02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:44.480]  by russia he didn't increase sanctions on russia when he had a chance to do so he hasn't even tweeted
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:53.040]  a single concern this threat i believe demands a whole of government response and that response
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:59.360]  needs to start with leadership at the top at the same time other threat story institutions
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:05.280]  come from right here at home there have been some aided and abetted by russian internet
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:10.720]  bots and trolls who've attacked the basic integrity of the fbi and the justice department
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:16.880]  this is a dangerous trend this campaign of innuendo and misinformation
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:23.920]  shall arm all of us regardless of our partisan affiliation now let me explain something about
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:31.040]  senator warner here he is a snake in the grass because that entire three-minute question
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:36.960]  mon you know monologue whatever you want to say that he went on there was 100 percent
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:42.720]  so that democrat media could use that for clips and play it on tonight's shows
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:46.240]  and as i'm listening i'm saying hey crew was that the statement he made earlier and they're
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:51.760]  saying yes that was a statement and they're already telling me npr is using it cnn is using it and so
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.000]  i remember watching that warner when mark warner was saying that and i went to the war room twitter
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.240]  account and i actually tweeted out i was like i was like you watch the only reason why warner made
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:05.920]  that statement was so that democrat media could use it later and say look russia's clearly tampering
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:12.080]  our election they all agree even though trump's name was never even brought up and then jim schiato
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:18.160]  from cnn totally misrepresents what warner didn't said and what dan coat said during the questioning
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:22.560]  but we'll get more into that later with roger stone in the meantime we are joined by gavin
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:29.520]  mcginnis and i think i think that we've got something very strange to talk about here gavin a strange
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:35.200]  portrait of barack and michelle obama i'm not sure which one is worse i guess we could just start
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:43.200]  there which one of the obama portraits is worse the obama one is worse because of the context
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:48.480]  we're never going to see that michelle obama one anywhere but when you're your son your grandson
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.760]  looks up presidential portraits you'll see the little little little all the same and then some
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:59.680]  guy in a bunch of leaves and the reason obama did that is because it's an f u to traditionalism
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:05.840]  and america in general so he's not about america he's about obama and i think this presidential
[02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:13.040]  portrait perfectly sums up that megalomania uh gavin first of all let me compliment you on your
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:20.880]  official proud boys pocket protector it's it's a great look i love it i love it two dollars
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:26.720]  fifty on our merch at our merch store you know uh it's actually funny this obama portrait it gets
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:32.160]  even stranger and stranger so you have the artist that did the depiction of black women
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:36.560]  decapitating white women and you can tell it's totally a racially motivated thing just by the
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:41.520]  the artwork and then you've got the other thing i could even believe that when i came in here and
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:48.880]  you saw alex jones reporting on how this artist likes to put semen on his uh on his artwork i mean
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:53.360]  and then there's the other thing about obama being in the weeds it's almost the perfect
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.880]  representation of his presidency in the weeds is like a saying it's like you're in the weed
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:01.200]  you're far behind you don't know what you're doing you're clueless you're hopeless that was obama
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:06.560]  that that was barack obama i mean the portrait is actually rather rather stunning as far as
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:11.600]  his accuracy is concerned well i think they have to be seen in some context obama looks like he's
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:17.360]  taking a dump and michelle looks like she's smelling it i mean uh it smells like shift too
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:22.560]  it does smell like shift but more of that later this there's so many layers of allegory here
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.440]  and if kandy wiley did this portrait to make us talk about him then he did a great job i think
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:33.360]  it's fascinating that the guy's a complete fraud he's a fairly good painter from the early the
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:38.880]  mid aughts who discovered he could just send pictures down to china and they will paint them
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:44.880]  meticulously and do the photorealism so around 2010 his paintings get about 40 percent better
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:50.000]  overnight because he opened up a sweatshop in beijing where they do all this work and i think
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.520]  he does this firms because he gets back like you can see even on this uh obama one the leaves are
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:01.120]  repeated because he's just used a photoshop pattern and and copied it with the stamp tool
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.240]  and then he sends this photoshop collage the chinese recreated perfectly and i bet when it
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:10.960]  comes back he feels kind of guilty he goes i'm one of the highest paid artists of my generation
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.160]  i'm just going to add some squiggly sperms just to sort of make me feel better about the fact that
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:24.480]  this is a complete ripoff there's the uh the pictures on info wars dot com obama portrait
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:30.400]  shock president covered in sperm i thought at first i thought maybe this was a reference to
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.240]  maybe perhaps some homosexuality tendencies that he might have i didn't realize this was like a
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:40.960]  thing that the artist does but i mean it's a meme i guess yeah sub theme of his work some subtext
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:47.200]  there is really weird well he's really into hot guys because he's gay and he's his his background
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.400]  is painting super hot black thugs and then painting them in sort of a napoleon thing
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:58.880]  so he's got chinese people depicting black guys doing white history it's like hamilton
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:04.160]  all over again so much of this recent black culture seems to be about fantasizing that
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:11.120]  that uh european history is their history and they crossed the swiss alps and and you know they they
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:16.240]  discovered america they were the founding fathers and and i don't mind that per se but i just mind
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:21.440]  that you have a problem with whites i love including blacks but now you're determined to sort of
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:26.640]  exclude whites out of some sort of i believe racist animosity you know it's funny you mentioned
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:33.120]  that when i was in uh london i took in hamilton uh and i actually enjoyed it but i had no idea
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:38.880]  thomas jefferson was black no idea and i don't care that you made thomas jefferson black i care
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:45.200]  that you mind that thomas jefferson was white why why are you so put off why can you not
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:50.240]  read american history if it's a bunch of as they say dead white men what's the matter with dead white
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:57.360]  men well they founded this country to begin with i like some of my favorite guys are dead white guys
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:02.800]  yeah you better watch out you're you know you're you're talking kind of kind of racist stuff now
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:08.240]  there you you can't be glorifying white people that's why we need to hire black artists that
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.760]  depict white women being beheaded by black women and then also as just kind of an aside like to
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:18.800]  put sperm in their art that's just what that's just it that's just art to me it's one thing if
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:21.840]  you're going to be obsessed with affirmative action it's another thing if you're going to be
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:28.000]  lazy about it and there's there's probably millions of old black dudes who smoke a pipe
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:33.680]  who can do photorealism who would do a traditional uh presidential portrait you could add a little
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.120]  twist you could even be wearing sunglasses i don't know but no you had to go all out and
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:46.240]  get a gay racist to make fun of all the other presidential portraits because you don't like

[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:40.560]  well you just never know you never know what's going on here at info wars it's so crazy alex
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:46.080]  jones might be walking around the corner seeing what you're researching with the most breaking news
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:51.120]  as we are visited live by gavin mcginnis you know one of the things that's not being reported on
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:57.120]  that happened as far as the portrait reveal yesterday was the fact that all other portraits
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.400]  revealed at least from my knowledge and i just did a brief look into history roger you were
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:08.080]  confirming this as far as your memory concerned uh as well they're always done at the white house
[02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:14.320]  they always do the portrait reveal at the white house yes but for obama they did it at the
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:19.040]  smithsonian so i'm wondering why didn't the obamas have the portrait reveals at the white house is
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.320]  that because oh well obviously the trumps and the obamas probably don't get along considering
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:28.160]  obama was illegally spying on him is because malania had the white house uh exercise from the
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:32.560]  demons the obamas left behind and she didn't want the obamas back is because the obamas didn't want
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:36.480]  to go back because they know they're being looked into for for all this potential treason
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:40.160]  they probably that's probably i think you hit it malania probably didn't want to reinfect the
[02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:44.960]  place yeah she already had an exercise she want those demons coming back that could be it what do
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:49.200]  you think gavin i mean i you know you're pretty creative artistic guy i mean you've got the pocket
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:53.120]  protector on you've got the glasses i mean i'd assume you can make art just by looking at you
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:58.560]  that's what i do um but but i think that you know the michelle obama portrait i mean that was just
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:03.600]  a total hack job i mean who drew that they don't know how to shade i mean it's like well it doesn't
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:10.080]  even look like her i mean what shello michelle obama is so hideous that she looks disproportioned
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:15.040]  in real life sometimes when you see her just a photograph of her it looks like a bad drawing
[02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:20.880]  well that might be for a reason it's possible those giant crocodile hands and that hideous face
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:26.800]  in those bizarre proportions it's possible those are all completely accurate well you know it's
[02:22:26.800 --> 02:22:32.240]  funny that she she chose an artist who is a self-described social justice warrior artist
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:37.520]  and that she represents the perfect kind of black that liberals love they don't love real deal
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:41.680]  blacks that you know are working class and are busting their ass that love america they like
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:47.680]  quirky ones that have like funny frames and some blonde tips and listen to npr and and will do
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:54.240]  tricks when you tell them to it really it the the the people they chose the black gay intellectual
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:59.120]  who who outsources his work and the social justice warrior woman they really represent
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:04.240]  the kind of black people that white people want not really authentic blacks but sort of
[02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:10.640]  pet negroes if you will well careful careful there go back to the uh can you guys go back to
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.120]  the michelle portrait real quick you know they they're making it a depiction like she's uh propping
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:19.920]  up her elbow on her or her arm on her knee other people think she might be propping it up on uh
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:24.080]  on her third arm if you know what i mean but maybe the problem is that the the uh the artist
[02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:28.240]  actually drew a woman maybe maybe that was the problem the artist actually drew a woman
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:33.520]  and then on the other side actually if you if you notice look at obama's left hand in the
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.960]  portrait if you actually zoom in on obama's left hand it looks like the artist made him
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:44.720]  with six fingers it just gets weirder and weirder look at this oh and you just saying that just
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:50.960]  got a poor little asian fourteen-year-old thrashed with ten lashes he's being camed right now for
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:55.040]  failing to do his job you just got him kicked out of the sweatshop way to go i'm sorry i didn't
[02:23:55.040 --> 02:24:03.920]  know that the what i that was part of the chinese photoshop job no no uh cahende does the photoshop
[02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:09.680]  the chinese have to sit there for a hundred hours meticulously painting it so they can have enough
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:15.120]  ramen to not starve to death if you look at his face it's a little odd i could be wrong but i
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:20.000]  i think he has the bottom third of richard nixon's face isn't that nixon's face across the bottom
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.680]  well the jolly those jolly we're told nixon was the worst guy on earth because he dared to record
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:32.000]  someone it turns out obama was spying on absolutely everyone aren't nixon and obama kindred spirits
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.880]  in that sense well other than the fact that what nixon did pales in comparison in terms of the
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:43.120]  scope of what obama did remember at least nixon's was a private job six misguided individuals break
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:48.560]  into the watergate never play a bug that works obama uses the entire authority and power of the
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:54.640]  state to spy on the republican candidate for president sweeping in its illegality i want
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:25:00.320]  exactly and we'll never stop hearing about nixon they just crowbarred the pentagon papers
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:04.720]  into that movie the post yeah and made it all about nixon even though he wasn't even mentioned
[02:25:04.720 --> 02:25:11.440]  them once that wasn't his problem and no one is going to do a movie in 20 30 years about how obama
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:17.120]  was far worse than nixon the double standards from these people is just shocking sometimes well in
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.800]  fact their timing is really bad because on the one hand they're celebrating the fact that the post
[02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:28.000]  in the new york times courageously published classified information when we want at the same
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:34.800]  time to send julie and assange for to jail for publishing classified information it's what journalists
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:42.080]  do even the obama administration concluded that if you prosecuted assange you'd have to prosecute
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:46.000]  every journalist in america and every major newspaper well liberals have double standards
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.160]  roger wow i didn't even realize that thank you for enlightening me on that pretty amazing i i want
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:55.760]  to get both of your opinions on something here as we uh as we close the segment though why what
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:02.000]  happened with this portrait was this an intentional move from obama did he say look i want you to
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.880]  make this an abomination i want you to make this as corky as possible i want you to make me stick
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:10.800]  out do whatever you got to do just you know go ahead and put your little sperm on there do the
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.960]  little six finger deal whatever you got to do and uh it was like okay so that was the deal you
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.840]  know he obviously knew that this artist drew depictions of black women de uh decapitating
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:25.920]  white women or did the artist kind of take it upon himself to make it all about him was this
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:30.880]  an artist move to say oh i'm gonna make this about me i'm gonna make it corky i'm gonna put my little
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.560]  you know foot footnote on this and everything what what do you think was the deal here roger was
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:38.160]  this more an obama call or did the artist take it into his own hands oh and i don't think you're
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.520]  getting it you're just not getting it this is hip don't you see that it's hip the obamas are i'm
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:49.680]  sorry i didn't realize what do you think gavin kahende wiley's never done anything but this
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:56.480]  he his first paintings were gorgeous hunk gay thugs or thugs that he was attracted to
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:00.480]  with this floral arrangement behind them with patterns behind them i'm here in new york
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:05.040]  where the man is a god you go to the brooklyn museum and the whole lobby just kahende wiley
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:10.480]  kahende wiley he's royalty here so there's no way you commission a portrait from wiley
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.240]  and not know that you're going to be subsumed by the background that's that's the way this
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:21.280]  guy's paint this guy paints and i think he chose wiley by the way because they were both abandoned
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:27.440]  by their african fathers and they both worship africa and put it way before america with their
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.880]  african prince all over the place so barack obama and his love for the third world and
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:38.560]  wiley's obsession with africa are both intertangled they both show that when you abandon a child
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:44.320]  he will prefer the east to the west and that painting symbolize that this painting says
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.840]  i want to separate myself from all the other presidents and subsequently separate myself
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:55.040]  from america i'm not like you i'm better that's really a subject here i'm better
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:00.640]  i have a feeling that that portrait isn't going to be around long i don't know it's just a weird
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:05.040]  feeling i have that that portrait isn't going to be around long i think that it might be scrubbed
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:10.400]  just like obama's legacy as you know the portraits of nixon and agdo are both put in storage i have
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:15.920]  feeling this one may be ultimately headed to the same place storage and incinerator if obama is
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.720]  ultimately prosecuted because the real question of the day as you know is what did the president
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:26.800]  know about the spying on donald trump and when did he know it because no person is above the law is
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:31.520]  that obama pointing at his six finger gaven is that what we just saw there is that hold on that's
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:36.240]  only how bad they are at all this like they're bad at choosing an artist they get a guy who wants to
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:40.640]  decapitate white people they didn't even google him first and then they do this russia collusion
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.680]  crap they're so half-assed about it leaving a paper trail everywhere they go we got anthony weiner
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:51.360]  leaving his computer open in front of a prostitute like not only these people want to be macchiavalean
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:57.920]  but they're more like lost children are trying to have a man's house with hear that that's the sound

[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:46.640]  a dollar fifty a buck fifty one dollar fifty cents that's how much i'd pay for obama's portrait
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:52.240]  oh and you're overpaying you think this is garbage i mean this is just pop culture garbage
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:57.040]  a dollar fifty gavin what is that overpriced a dollar fifty for obama's portrait
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:03.760]  uh yeah i think that's a little rich i mean a roll of toilet paper costs you know
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:08.880]  a buck well the problem with buying art is more useful than this you got to have this up in your
[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:14.240]  house you have to look at it every day and it's just going to make you mad well you're you've got
[02:34:14.240 --> 02:34:18.640]  you know get off my lawn with gab mcginnis that's the name of your show obama's permanently implanted
[02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:25.680]  on your lawn now yeah he really is he's permanently entrenched it just it's it's just i did my whole
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:31.520]  show on it by the way for tonight because the whole thing just sums up all of this animosity
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:36.720]  all this needless racism all this needless division that goes on in the states just and
[02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:41.680]  that the amount of the lack of gratitude the lack of reverence for america and tradition
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:48.640]  and it just shows what this sjw culture has done to the country it's made us hate each other when
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:54.560]  this country was founded on the notion of everyone being about meritocracy i don't care where you're
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:58.560]  from i don't care if you're black if you're white let's work hard and i'll come together but no they
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:05.200]  have to get these sjw's in there needling it china pushes back to the civil rights pre-civil rights
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:10.000]  era where there was hatred everywhere that's what they want that's where they thrive yeah and the
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:15.120]  lack of class too guys if you could actually zoom in on that picture that gabin has pulled up or
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:19.680]  find a similar picture because i want to get roger stone's take on this obviously roger you are a
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:26.480]  fashion critique if you will and you like to dabble in best dressed lists people know about this
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:32.560]  i'd like to know your comments first of all to me i'm not sure what uh michelle uh obama is wearing
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:38.720]  at this event but uh since when do uh female wear females wear navy togas is that a is
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:43.440]  that a thing i'm missing the other thing that occurred to me is that if they had put obama
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:49.600]  in a leaf colored suit or look like a talking heads album cover which they probably thought about
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:55.760]  at least briefly i want to get guys can we get uh can we get michelle obama from that day on
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:00.720]  she's wearing like a navy toga it's a real hideous look and then and then roger what about the suit
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:05.120]  that the uh that the the i've already forgotten the male artist's name he's not i don't even need
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:11.680]  henday wiley henday henday who who who who day who day wiley henday who day uh what did you think
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:18.080]  about his suit roger uh oh there's the navy toga what is that yeah that's odd i didn't see the
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:24.400]  artist's suit so i'm not yet in a position to put him on the worst dress list guys let's get um
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:29.200]  henday who day can we get who day on the uh you know you know michelle obama looks like
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:35.760]  that dress looks like she was having an affair and then the uh the the husband she was having an
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:41.440]  affair with the husband the wife came home and she threw her she was brand new behind the carpet
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:45.920]  and then the the woman found out threw all her clothes in the garbage and then she had to run
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:50.880]  out of the house with the the curtain as her clothes and she just sort of wrapped around
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:56.160]  herself like braveheart and was running through the streets trying to get shelter so go back one
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:01.040]  was that the artist on the left yeah that that was him okay so he borrowed that suit from spiked
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:08.720]  jones not spiked jones the movie producer spiked jones and the city slickers 1940 that's for that
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:15.840]  that's hideous boy today's man i think well i'll tell you i think international maybe the international
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:20.480]  male catalog i just can't believe that they they put this portrait out there didn't they
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:25.520]  realized they just gave us a platform to make fun of barack obama for at least the next week
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.560]  month years even i mean this portrait is just a total abomination it's the most memeable portrait
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:34.800]  that you've ever seen uh we're gonna be we've got a ton of memes that we're gonna be covering on the
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:40.000]  war room later with myself and roger stone i mean it's just hilarious um i want to take some calls
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.200]  with uh with gavin as well but gavin just final words on the uh the uh portrait if uh if we are
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:51.360]  willing to call it that you know long ago i sat down i prayed and i said lord please make my
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:58.400]  enemies look ridiculous and he's overdone it slow god slow down i'm getting tired of winning i
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:04.800]  didn't mean that ridiculous dial it down a notch sir yeah he didn't want to have obama on his lawn
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:08.960]  permanently the name of the show is get off my lawn you just gave him a punchline for the rest of his
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.920]  uh for the rest of his show there it is roger yep spiked jones see it's the same suit that suits
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:18.000]  actually maybe a little better looking i can't tell it's not in color but at least that one doesn't
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:25.600]  seem to be oh oh boy oh goodness that's like from the nightmare before christmas what uh hinde hude
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:30.880]  has on the nightmare before christmas hinde hude with from the nightmare before christmas all right
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.840]  let's take a phone call we've got roger stone we got gavin mcginnis on uh let's go to fernie well
[02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:39.760]  what do you have to say about the uh portrait you have a question for gavin for roger stone what's
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:46.480]  on your mind uh looks like i'm gonna need to contact hinde and obama for my next hot dog party
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:51.520]  since there you can get sixty eight thousand dollars worth of succulent hot dogs with obama
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:58.080]  yeah oh i thought of a new name too for uh for shift you can call them baffo shift
[02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:07.200]  for instead of uh for baffo met because you know they like to lie and uh that's terrible i kind of
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:12.640]  like shift for brains as a yeah that's much better new appellation i still like piece of shift
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:21.040]  did did you see tucker carlson destroy the other half of the dynamic duo of dumb congressman
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:28.400]  eric swallow last night stunning piece of work just destroyed him what else on your mind fernie um i
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:34.640]  originally called for the uh the ai and like uh the singularity and trying to like slow the slow
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:41.440]  process of ending biology or ending sciences um as uh as a means to an end to get us to believe in
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.720]  you know the fake singularity because the real singularity you know i i can feel it it's crazy
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:52.000]  so but you're talking about more the technological aspect and not the aspect of the social justice
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:59.760]  warriors now forming the lgbtq f yz h w two niner two four plus exclamation point nine qc
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:06.480]  that's a part of it too um i actually did like a small youtube video um if you go to f
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:13.360]  e r n y space 1337 on youtube like so they get into the school is right they break up the families
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:19.760]  there's no friends there's no identity then there's no language no words um then they start banning
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:26.960]  the words and then all of a sudden you have to you have to speak in this code where you you can only
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:30.720]  speak certain words and say yeah now they're saying you can't say best friend they already don't
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.200]  want you to say merry christmas it's all this stuff you know i i don't know and i actually just
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:39.200]  thought of something else that i i kind of have to actually go off on a on a different direction
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:43.280]  now because i just thought of this while we have gabin on hey gabin were some of the members of the
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:48.320]  proud boys under attack at washington university was that were those proud boys i saw in that video
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:54.560]  yeah they got smashed in the back of the head they had bat batons baton yeah they tried to sneak
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:41:01.360]  up on it too and mace and so they came right at these boys this was the the washington division
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:07.200]  and they started as their want to do fighting back and you've never seen people more stunned
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:11.760]  and you know what else is funny about it too as they're getting pounded for pepper spraying someone
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:15.920]  one guy's like this he got the back of his head open up this other guy's just nailing them all
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.560]  every time they get punched they go flying back because literally this is your first punch
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:27.360]  baby's first punch and and and then as this is happening there's this little girl she's maybe
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:32.160]  like five i shouldn't say little girl but small woman and she's doing that thing that that these
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:36.000]  overly empowered feminists do where they think they can just take over the world and they go
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.640]  hey hey hey what's going on here what are you doing what are you doing and you're like lady
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:45.680]  you're going up to a giant man who's in a fist fight and you're talking like you're his kindergarten
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:51.680]  teacher what are you doing here get out of here these women think they can beat up men and they're
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:57.280]  going to get killed well that was the crazy thing about it is how i mean they pepper spray
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:01.920]  and then they get hit back and they're like what what are you doing me how dare you how dare you
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:07.440]  gather i really believe those in a nutshell they have this thin veneer of hubris and when you
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:16.720]  just go pluk like that they go what are you doing stop stop we have police police after police oh police
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:23.760]  get me a cop salt that's the salt they always say that yeah i'm my recent trip across florida i had

[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:15.680]  your labor out there getting shouted down getting pushed around and even getting spit on so uh

[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:34.720]  gears to him i have uh a request and a question but first i just wanted to say you know around my
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:40.720]  house at 8 p.m. it's tucker time that's because i sit the family around the tv we watch tucker
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:48.880]  carlson as he takes on all the libtards like adam shithead and eric swallows wealth but i gotta say
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:56.560]  whenever he mentions ellis jones's name it's always in a negative it's always a tinfoil hat
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:01.520]  or conspiracy theory or something like that i'm really getting annoyed with it because
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:08.000]  tucker carlson um believe it or not should think out shones because if it wasn't for him having him
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:13.280]  on uh that time a couple years ago for about an for an hour long yeah he was in studio here
[02:51:13.920 --> 02:51:18.080]  yeah yeah people would not know tucker and he would not be in the position he's in
[02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:23.520]  and i know he's listening because he goes on and he repeats a lot of stuff that that he hears on here
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:29.040]  so tucker if you're if you're gonna say his name say be positive or just keep his name out of your
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:35.120]  mouth because because people like me are getting tired of it now uh roger storm first a request
[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:41.680]  because i know you have the president's ear please have him lift the uh the ban on cubans coming
[02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:46.880]  into our country i think we need to do everything we can to undermine communism in this hemisphere
[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:53.280]  it would go a long way for diplomacy certainly for the uh current cubans living here we need
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:59.200]  all the good cubans we have here my wife is a beautiful smart cuban who escaped uh through
[02:51:59.200 --> 02:52:04.160]  Venezuela and is very thankful to be here but she has many of family members who would love
[02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:08.400]  to trade places with a bunch of the socialists here so any you know people out there who want to
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:13.040]  vote bernie sanders i say we just trade and let them trade spots with them no that's actually i've
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:17.120]  actually literally suggested that before trump offer you know say hey if you want to leave the
[02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:20.720]  country okay here pick your country we'll send you there but actually i want to hear roger uh let's
[02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:25.600]  let roger respond to not only uh the tucker carlson points but if you wanted to comment as well on
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:30.240]  the cuban let's take him one at a time but the irony of this of course is i happen to know this
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:36.800]  for an absolute fact tucker carlson really likes alex jones and he respects him uh so i don't think
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:45.440]  he says these things with any animosity uh that said i think the brass at fox have a general order
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:51.520]  that no one is allowed to go on info wars why they view us as competition even though we don't
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:57.680]  view them as competition we view them as comrades in the greater fight for freedom as for your cuba
[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:04.720]  point i am also married to a beautiful accomplished cuban woman i couldn't agree with you more okay
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:09.280]  that's great but i i'm i believe i've probably caught every episode and i certainly saw you on
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:14.640]  there you had a great appearance on there but and whenever he mentions alex jones it's always
[02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:19.520]  tin foil hat conspiracy theory well and i'll just say to it to me it's like the same thing that happened
[02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:27.840]  to uh matt gates when he got set up on cnn by jake tapper who matt gates just unloads a litany of facts
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:32.880]  about the the clinton paid for dossier and everything and then jake tapper says yeah well
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:37.920]  you went on the alex jones show as if that somehow discounts all the facts that he just laid out and
[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:41.280]  matt gates was like look i don't agree with alex on everything but hey he's got an audience he's a
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:46.080]  real person why can't i talk to him yeah i guess you when you go on cnn does that mean you agree
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:51.840]  with everything that jake tapper or wolf blitzer said of course not we're a news network here we
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:56.800]  have guests that we don't agree with on everything but they're interesting they're newsworthy and
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:00.880]  they have a point of view which is why we bring them here i guess i would say this to you josh if
[02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:05.280]  if fox or tucker or anyone and i have no beef with tucker or matt gates if they want to talk
[02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:08.160]  trash on enforce because i don't think they believe it at the end of the day i think they agree with
[02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:13.040]  the things we say and they probably like us but if that's what they do or that's what they have
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:18.720]  to do or whatever the case is then that's fine because that only draws more people to us at the
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:22.800]  end of the day because we're not getting involved with infighting with tucker or fox or matt gates
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:26.800]  or anyone we we like what they do and we will support them as long as they support america i
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:34.000]  mean that's how i feel about it uh look tucker has been so devastating in his handling of both adam
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:41.120]  schiff uh and eric swalwell as in don't swalwell that it's covered in schiff uh that you you've
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:44.800]  got it you got to love it you just got to all right josh thank you so much for the call i got
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:55.280]  to move on though let's go to cj in rhode island go ahead cj uh thank you um so today i really do
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:02.960]  want to get into the subjects the overturning of the presidential election i think they're
[02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:10.640]  gonna arrest trump's president white house aids uh i do have a lead on the assassination of president
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:17.040]  trump and before you say i'm sure you do just hear me out uh and i think when they do overturn the
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:23.360]  presidential election i think obama's gonna run for a third term in that new election when i have
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:33.280]  to be honest cj you're sounding crazy to me well i mean you can think that if you want but well uh i
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:38.560]  think you were on track there but for the last point i wrote a piece for him for wars a couple
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:44.960]  weeks ago where i basically said the establishment has plan a plan b plan c and plan d plan a was the
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:51.760]  electoral college in the recount it failed plan b is the russian collusion delusion it's failing
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:59.200]  plan c is the 25th amendment plan d uh we there was probably another plan on there too with the
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.760]  me too movement as well i think that was another plan well that good point yeah so uh but the point
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:09.440]  of course is that we have had two presidents deposed one in a violent coup one in a peaceful
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:17.600]  but legal coup uh and you cannot underestimate the deep enmity that the political establishment
[02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:22.880]  and the elites of both parties have for donald trump and their resolve to do exactly what you say
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:28.000]  to undo what they couldn't do at the ballot box undo the results of the last election and i'll just
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.400]  say this to you cj and we'll let you finish it off i was saying it sounded crazy having obama
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.960]  for a third term i i don't see that ever happening at all maybe trying to put hillary in there or
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.280]  electing someone else but my thing with the assassination is and i don't know what lead you
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:46.880]  you claim you have a lead on that uh i do believe that there was a lead and that they have text
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:53.280]  messages perhaps even from fbi agents talking about a political assassination or the assassination of
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:58.080]  trump and those aren't even on the burner phones or the ham radios that these people were using
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.800]  to communicate as well so that's my thing i think trump has an ace card in that if they do try to
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:07.760]  assassinate trump they already know who's going to be guilty because they have the text uh go ahead
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:16.480]  cj well the obama third term think he said he wanted to run in december 2016 he went on the ax wells
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:21.600]  radio program and said obama also didn't say you build a business i mean since when do you
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:26.320]  believe a word obama says well also there's a minor there is that you need a constitutional change
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:31.440]  even for him to run which is why he would just insert michelle oh wait a minute she's not hasn't
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:36.000]  been in the u.s citizen long enough to be eligible oh problem there funny how that were thank you for

[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:10.640]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
[03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:13.600]  you're listening to alex jones
[03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:23.200]  i think what shocks me roger it bothers me but it doesn't bother me as much sometimes i guess it
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:29.360]  depends on the day but it shocks me that you have two networks that are completely devoted to just
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:35.920]  lying about trump slandering trump hating trump and that's msn bc and cnn i mean that's all you get
[03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:39.920]  all day and so it shocks me when you have those two networks that that's all they do and you
[03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:44.960]  can't even go there without getting some sort of tripe garbage just made up to to make trump
[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:51.040]  look better even nice trump but then you've got the abc's you know the cbs's the mbc's they pepper in
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:54.560]  their anti-trump propaganda as well and i know we're going to be covering these clips on the
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:59.920]  war room coming up from three to six p.m central with uh with with uh yourself and i but i mean
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:05.200]  has there ever been a time obviously the media you know we know about operation mockingbird we
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:10.960]  know about media being politicized but has there ever been a time in your career covering politics
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:16.480]  and being involved in politics where one side of the media has not just been slanted but just
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:22.000]  been completely fake i mean just lying just will go on air every day and it's like a competition
[03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:26.560]  between cnn and msnbc who can tell the most egregious lie about trump that day yeah no these
[03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:33.440]  are grotesque fabrications that's what you're seeing on msnbc if you watch msnbc uh and i watched
[03:01:33.440 --> 03:01:38.720]  this clip with joy reed i think we're going to play it on the war room later it looks like a saturday
[03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:44.560]  night light spoof nobody could really be this stupid nobody can really be this uninformed that
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:49.840]  right and they just and they just lie again and again joy reed wrote roger stone urged
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:56.240]  donald trump to end the republican party's long time opposition to russia no i didn't i never said
[03:01:56.240 --> 03:02:01.840]  i never said anything of the kind joy why would you write that i called on her to to uh to correct
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:06.800]  that she declined well and and this is the other thing too we're going to play the tucker carlson
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:11.680]  with eric swalwell on the war room later swalwell says something in that interview that i find
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:19.440]  shocking he says well you know cuz tucker's like look it's been a year and a half why don't you
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:25.680]  have any evidence at least in this republican memo you know we have something where we can put names
[03:02:25.680 --> 03:02:30.720]  to dates to circumstances to say this is how we came up with this situation in this scenario
[03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:34.240]  they still have nothing to prove any collusion with russia or trump or anything like that
[03:02:34.880 --> 03:02:40.320]  but then swalwell says well tucker if the republicans would let us get on with this
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:44.480]  investigation we could interview some of the witnesses and suspects i think we could get
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:50.080]  some information he's talking about you who would they not interviewed they have threatened
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:56.400]  the only person who's pled the fifth refused to be interviewed are the officials from fusion gps
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:02.560]  yes their guys michael caputo went answered every question i went i answered every question we
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:08.320]  weren't pleading the fifth they have full access to anyone they want when when the bbc asked me
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:13.200]  about this when i said on the bbc there's no evidence they say well muhler's got the evidence
[03:03:13.200 --> 03:03:19.680]  no he doesn't he's got nothing he's got zero that's why we're back to the termination of
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:25.520]  komi and flinn as procedural issues on which they're going to try to trip the president up
[03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:31.120]  but that's why i'm just so shocked by this that somebody like eric swalwell an actual democrat
[03:03:31.120 --> 03:03:37.920]  an actual representative of this government goes on a television show tucker carlson gets
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:44.880]  watched by millions of people and says well if the republicans would cooperate and let us interview
[03:03:44.880 --> 03:03:50.640]  the witnesses and interview the suspects we get down to it and i'm just like you that piece of shift
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:54.880]  knows that they've interviewed everybody and i know when he's in there he's thinking i just
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:59.600]  want to interview roger stone i know that he's russian i know he's got the details he just won't
[03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:05.360]  tell me well i was in there for four hours under oath uh every republican member on the committee
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:10.160]  lined up to shake my hands when it was over and they also questioned you and their questions were
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:16.000]  were some of them were they were all uh very tightly written and they were all constructive but
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:20.320]  they were the appropriate questions like for example mr stone do you know if anybody in the
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:25.840]  trump campaign who colluded coordinated or conspired with the russians to affect the outcome of the
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:32.880]  election no congressman i do not and again the democrats smashed the servers the democrats
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:40.720]  deleted the emails fusion gps won't cooperate and eric swalwell knows all of that or he has to be
[03:04:40.720 --> 03:04:46.960]  the most incompetent boob in the history of politics or both probably both roger stone
[03:04:46.960 --> 03:04:51.840]  oh insurer sign off paul joseph wasin takes over till the war room at three o'clock central right

[03:06:05.520 --> 03:06:14.160]  host paul joseph watson we're live it is the fourth hour of the alex joneshow on this february
[03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:20.800]  13th edition at the bottom of the hour we're going to talk to sticks hexan hammer 666 that's his
[03:06:20.800 --> 03:06:25.520]  moniker that's what he goes by he's been on the show before he's a youtube commentator and we're
[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:32.320]  going to talk about youtube censorship once again because last week the wall street journal which
[03:06:32.320 --> 03:06:38.320]  of course previously attacked basically framed smear pewdiepie a meek mild mannered swede who
[03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:45.120]  plays video games as a nazi and basically impugned all independent creators on youtube as part of
[03:06:45.120 --> 03:06:51.360]  the alt right the far right to demonizers they were out again last week with another hit piece
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:57.520]  in which they were lobbying youtube to censor more and more people the headline of that article was
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:07:04.640]  how youtube drives people to the internet's darkest corners so they tried to set it up as again a big
[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:10.880]  hit piece against anyone who dares challenge the legacy media monopoly a couple of days later
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:15.840]  you had the ceo of news corp come out of course news corp owns the wall street journal
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:22.480]  robert tompson he came out in an article and he called on facebook and google to censor
[03:07:22.480 --> 03:07:29.360]  the to tackle quote misinformation and the reason he gave for this in his own words was we
[03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:33.840]  wrote an article about this for him for wars dot com the reason he gave for this was quote
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:41.040]  because the potential returns for our journalism get that the potential returns for our journalism
[03:07:41.040 --> 03:07:48.160]  would be far higher in a less chaotic less debased digital environment so he's brazenly
[03:07:48.160 --> 03:07:54.160]  admitting the agenda behind censoring alternative voices aside from the political aspect is because
[03:07:54.160 --> 03:08:00.160]  it would make them more money he brazenly admitted it in an interview with afp nobody picked up on
[03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:05.840]  that apart from us and so you have news corp through all its subsidiary media outlets and they're
[03:08:05.840 --> 03:08:14.080]  not alone in doing this lobbying youtube lobbying facebook lobbying google to censor quote fake news
[03:08:14.080 --> 03:08:19.120]  who's on their list of fake news well what a surprise it's bright bar is daily caller it's
[03:08:19.120 --> 03:08:25.680]  info wars dot com these aren't fake news sites these are conservative news sites and we can't
[03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:31.600]  have alternative voices can we we must silence those because they want a monopoly in terms of
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:37.920]  controlling the narrative and they want to make more money it's very very simple of course you had
[03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:44.640]  senator mark warner of course come out last week and basically call on again lobby youtube to change
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:51.520]  its algorithm so they demo conservative viewpoints conservative opinions and the basically the only
[03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:58.480]  reason he gave was because there were negative videos about hillary clinton well boohoo i mean
[03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:03.120]  it that couldn't be anything to do with the fact that you know she was the most corrupt and inherently
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:09.600]  unlikeable presidential candidate in us history no no no it must have been a conspiracy that those
[03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:15.520]  videos which trashed hillary clinton got promoted or did well on youtube i mean they were buried
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:21.520]  under all the preferred partners that youtube has you know jimmy kimmel can get up and talk about
[03:09:21.520 --> 03:09:26.720]  gun control the day after a massacre if an independent creator tries to do it just to
[03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:32.320]  raise money for some of the victims they get censored because youtube says he can't monetize
[03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:38.160]  tragedies oh but jimmy kimmel can monetize tragedies if he's shilling for gun control
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:43.520]  now the reason senator mark warner gave was because there were negative videos about hillary
[03:09:43.520 --> 03:09:49.360]  clinton most notably to do with hillary's health well gee what could he be referring to maybe the
[03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:55.520]  info wars video that we put out in i think it was august 2016 about hillary's bizarre behavior which
[03:09:55.520 --> 03:09:59.760]  got over six million views by the end of it he couldn't possibly be talking about that could he
[03:09:59.760 --> 03:10:05.920]  be no so when we talk about hillary's health that's fake news that's conspiracy that's post
[03:10:05.920 --> 03:10:13.840]  truth world oh but cnn and msnbc can laboriously talk about donald trump's ill health donald trump
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:20.320]  being mentally deranged for weeks on end that can then be completely debunked disproven
[03:10:20.320 --> 03:10:25.840]  by a physician who by the way was also obama's physician and they will still talk about it
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:31.600]  as if it's a real news story after it's been debunked but if we talk about hillary clinton's
[03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:37.680]  health all that's fake news and it's a threat not only to democracy they had a buzzfeed article
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:44.800]  yesterday which said fake news bearing in mind fake news was a contrived moral panic a hoax
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:49.280]  created by the establishment because they were so panicked at the fact that they were losing the
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:53.920]  ability to manufacture consent but there was a buzzfeed article yesterday where they said
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:11:00.960]  fake news is not only a threat to democracy it was a threat to western civilization so their
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:06.960]  opinions their metropolitan elitist bubble control of the narrative being threatened
[03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:13.760]  is a threat to western civilization no it's a threat to you and your agenda failing that's
[03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:18.720]  what it's all about and that's why you're trying to censor us so you got senators calling for it
[03:11:18.720 --> 03:11:25.360]  you have the mainstream legacy media news corp wall street journal lobbying for youtube lobbying
[03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:31.520]  for google and facebook to demote conservative voices conservative content on the internet
[03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:37.920]  to make it not appear in your feed and as matt drudge warned years ago on this show when those
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:43.040]  social media environments become internet ghettos that's where all the content is that's where it
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:48.960]  gets monopolized then that's the battlefield you have to be on it now you see the wall street
[03:11:48.960 --> 03:11:53.600]  journal article from last week so there's this huge lobbying campaign they're going to resurrect
[03:11:53.600 --> 03:12:00.560]  this fake news hoax even though it collapsed basically at the start of last year remember the
[03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:07.280]  big washington post expose where they use bias left-wing outlets to compile their fake news list
[03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:13.840]  we have google if you ever noticed now on google you search for a topic the top results are always
[03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:21.120]  snopes.com snopes.com is the most biased far left organization imaginable the furthest you
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:28.240]  could possibly imagine from non-partisan from neutral the furthest possible they've got scandal
[03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:34.080]  on top of scandal coming out of that news outlet if you can call it that they put out debunking
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:38.400]  articles i mean i'll give you an example there was a quote by somebody close to hillary clinton
[03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:43.040]  last year during the election we wrote about this where he was saying something about the
[03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:48.640]  establishment controlling the narrative snopes.com took that quote which was a direct quote which
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:53.600]  we wrote up and put it in an article and they basically came out and said oh no he didn't mean
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:13:00.480]  to say this he meant to say something completely different and so they made up a quote for this
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:05.040]  globalist basically they contacted him and he said no that's not what i meant this is actually
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:10.240]  what i meant and they just invented a completely new quote and said oh this debunks you because
[03:13:10.240 --> 03:13:16.240]  now he's saying this was the original quote accurate was it genuine yes but they just completely
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:22.400]  made up their own fake news to try and debunk our fake news the most biased far left organization
[03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:27.840]  you can imagine people have gone through the roster of their employees far far left these
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:33.680]  are not neutral people yet now they're the ones in charge of filtering all this quote fake news
[03:13:33.680 --> 03:13:40.240]  and that's exactly why you're seeing snopes.com at the top of google search results on basically every
[03:13:40.800 --> 03:13:46.880]  hot button political topic right now they're trying to game the internet to mass social
[03:13:46.880 --> 03:13:52.720]  engineer to mass manipulate the population before the 2018 midterms this is coming down hard
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:58.640]  hard now in relation to this salon.com which is also lobbying google lobbying facebook to
[03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:04.160]  censor what they call toxic news outlets given that this is that you know an organization
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:11.040]  that literally gave a platform to a pedophile on several occasions now they're lecturing google
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:16.560]  and facebook about which toxic publications should be censored salon.com is actually introduced
[03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:21.760]  something on their website where if you go on their website and you're using an ad blocker
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:27.120]  a tweet about this earlier it pops up with a pop up ad and says we've noticed you're using an ad
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:32.160]  blocker now it gives you the option if you want to view salon.com why anyone would want to I
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:37.200]  don't know but this is just shows their desperation you have to either disable the ad blocker to
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:45.200]  continue to the website or you have to allow salon.com to use your cpu computing power in the
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:52.160]  background to mine bitcoin for them who in their right mind would do have you ever had like a pop
[03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:57.360]  up ad or a pop up video that plays when you're trying to read the news on a website or it just
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:02.800]  completely overwhelms your processing power if you've got like 10 tabs open at once that's annoying
[03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:08.480]  there's nothing more annoying than that now salon.com is forcing its readers if they've got an ad
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:14.720]  blocker into this program where their computer in the background was a way to mine bitcoin for
[03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:20.640]  salon.com because salon.com is going out of business there was an article in the new york
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:25.760]  post last year salon struggling to pay its rent they're basically getting kicked out of their
[03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:30.800]  new york office is almost they're not getting enough advertising money so now they're making
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:37.200]  their readers mine bitcoin for them hogging all their cpu space how annoying is that and now
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:43.760]  they're lobbying youtube go google facebook to censor alternative independent voices

[03:23:29.520 --> 03:23:37.680]  know basically the entire lifetime of our existence but now openly lobbying google to demotors openly
[03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:44.000]  lobbying youtube to have them have their algorithm demotors so our videos don't show up when people
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:49.600]  search for certain hot news topics on all these mainstream media channels which are by the way
[03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:56.000]  completely pathetic and failing nobody's interested there was an mtv news video last week which i
[03:23:56.000 --> 03:24:01.920]  highlighted on twitter this is mtv right fairly big company you would imagine via common all that
[03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:10.000]  it had like 200 views i get 200 views on a video 10 seconds after uploading it this video had been
[03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:15.600]  up a week it had 200 views you look on the comments you look on the downvotes they're getting completely
[03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:21.920]  decimated by the strength of their arguments because they have no arguments left their only
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:28.000]  argument for the past five plus years is to call everyone else a racist when you do that when you
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:32.720]  don't develop your own arguments you lose the strength like a muscle that you don't use it goes
[03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:37.440]  flaccid it goes weak that's all they've had for the best part of five years plus now they have no
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:42.960]  arguments left they're just saying oh let's just censor those people who oppose us ideologically
[03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:49.360]  and that's exactly what's happening now it's salon dot com lobbying youtube and facebook
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:55.760]  and google and twitter to do exactly that to silence alternative voices simply because
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:01.440]  they can't afford to pay the bills because they don't resonate with anyone you give a platform
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:06.400]  to a pedophile for god's sake you're not going to resonate with a lot of people not a great pr look
[03:25:06.400 --> 03:25:12.160]  is it salon dot com absolutely incredible they're going out of business they can't even afford their
[03:25:12.160 --> 03:25:17.360]  rent they're getting turfed out now they got an article up called pioneers of fake news can
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:22.960]  world net daily be saved where again they brag about how facebook and google are now demoting
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:28.480]  these websites simply because they're conservative they go through the entire list the usual suspects
[03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:33.760]  bright bottom four wars daily caller these are not fake news websites there are actual fake news
[03:25:33.760 --> 03:25:39.840]  websites they just happen to call fake news websites every single website right of center
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:46.880]  oh gee isn't that a coincidence let's move on now to some more global news this is up on info
[03:25:46.880 --> 03:25:52.880]  wars dot com criminologist says italian teen butchered by nigerian migrant could have been eaten
[03:25:53.680 --> 03:25:57.520]  some cultures are better than others now of course we had this story a couple of weeks back
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:26:03.040]  this happened in january an 18 year old italian girl was murdered and dismembered by a nigerian
[03:26:03.040 --> 03:26:07.520]  migrant who by the way was living in italy on an expired visa was about to be deported
[03:26:08.240 --> 03:26:13.120]  then now saying she could also have been the victim of cannibalism that coming from a top
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:18.640]  professor and criminologist who said that the murder bears the hallmarks of quote methods that
[03:26:18.640 --> 03:26:25.520]  the nigerian mafia applies systematically in nigeria and elsewhere so they're saying because
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:31.680]  parts of her body including parts of her genitals in her heart were not found that this could have
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:38.320]  been some kind of nigerian mafia cannibalist ritual he says it's an ancestral right that
[03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:44.560]  goes back to ancient times and that the victim this 18 year old girl may have been partially eaten
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:50.000]  even the defense lawyer for one of these accomplices alleged to have been involved in
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:55.840]  covering up this murder or at least disposing of the body also suggested that the murder could
[03:26:55.840 --> 03:27:00.640]  have been part of a voodoo style ritual we've seen that in even in america where the victim is
[03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:06.240]  dismembered in order to obtain spiritual power so this could have been part of some bizarre ritual
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:11.200]  not just a straightforward murder they're saying that the girl was basically hit with a blunt
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:17.440]  object she collapsed she died so this wasn't a drug overdose as some claimed and given all that
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:22.160]  given what's happening in it italy and some of those ports where they're having an onrush of
[03:27:22.160 --> 03:27:28.240]  migrants from greece and other areas from libya of course is it any surprise that with the upcoming
[03:27:28.240 --> 03:27:34.880]  italian election 65 percent of italians under the age of 35 are against mass migration they've
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:40.640]  got an election on march the fourth the guy who's tipped to win it or at least enter into a coalition
[03:27:40.640 --> 03:27:46.240]  with another conservative party silvia burlescon his party the guy who's tipped to win it and go
[03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:53.760]  into a coalition matto salvini he's promised to deport 500 000 illegal immigrants and secure the
[03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:59.600]  country's borders so is it any surprise that he's in pole position to win given what's happening
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:05.200]  in italy you actually had a revenge shooting in italy as well last week where somebody went out
[03:28:05.200 --> 03:28:10.240]  and tried to assassinate tried to shoot at people who he thought were involved in the murder and the
[03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:16.240]  butchering of this girl of course that was the big media story like racist shooting targets black
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:22.640]  italians or whatever they didn't even focus on what motivated that so that's the radicalization
[03:28:22.640 --> 03:28:28.480]  process now because italy is being overwhelmed you're now getting reprisal attacks against migrants
[03:28:28.480 --> 03:28:33.040]  many of whom are going to be innocent of doing anything so it's all escalating in a horrible
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:38.400]  direction and that is why it looks like italy is about to install a government that's going to
[03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:43.440]  actually do something about it we'll be back with our guest dick texan hammer in the next segment

[03:33:27.840 --> 03:33:33.280]  we're live it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show and i'm joined by my guest for his
[03:33:33.280 --> 03:33:38.720]  second appearance on the show it's one of my favorite youtube commentators now his real name
[03:33:38.720 --> 03:33:43.200]  is quite difficult to pronounce or remember so we're going to ignore that and just call him by
[03:33:43.200 --> 03:33:49.200]  his moniker which is how everyone knows him which is sticks hex and hammer 666 sticks welcome back
[03:33:50.240 --> 03:33:55.760]  thank you for having me on now we're here to talk about youtube censorship once again
[03:33:56.800 --> 03:34:00.560]  now basically across the board and i talked about this just before the break we got these
[03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:05.680]  leftist media establishments these legacy media establishments they've lost the argument their
[03:34:05.680 --> 03:34:11.120]  articles get completely decimated in comment sections you know if they even dare have comment
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:16.640]  sections at all so instead of reevaluating these arguments to see why they're no longer
[03:34:16.640 --> 03:34:23.040]  resonating with people they've decided instead to simply lobby for the censorship of opposing
[03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:29.360]  voices we saw this with a fake news panic back at the end of 2016 that kind of got extinguished
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:35.360]  they're now trying to bring it back i talked about an article um out of salon where they're lobbying
[03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:40.960]  facebook google youtube to censor quote fake news websites you check the list of fake news
[03:34:40.960 --> 03:34:46.000]  websites oh look it's every conservative news website on the internet what a coincidence
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:51.680]  that is right so we had this wall street journal article last week now they already attacked pewdie
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:55.680]  pie they already attacked independent content creators it was called in we can flash this
[03:34:55.680 --> 03:35:01.120]  flash this article up on screen how youtube drives people to the internet's darkest corners
[03:35:02.720 --> 03:35:09.760]  so they frame it in this dark kind of foreboding context this is not the first time they've gone
[03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:16.000]  after independent youtubers sticks what was the purpose behind this latest wall street journal
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:22.240]  hit piece break it down well this was apparently the same individual who also was writing about
[03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:27.840]  pewdie pie beforehand he's going off to the new york times so these groups they tend to share
[03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:33.280]  their talent so-called i thought it was funny though in reading it it doesn't even really
[03:35:33.280 --> 03:35:38.800]  mention why you know you're fake news or i'm fake news or bp earth watch or anyone else it just
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:44.080]  simply states that we are i think that the hope generally is that the sort of people who take
[03:35:44.080 --> 03:35:47.520]  the wall street journal of the new york times or whatever seriously they're not going to look too
[03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:51.680]  deeply into it they're not part of youtube culture they don't understand you know that there is
[03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:56.480]  independent analysis they don't necessarily even care about that sort of thing because they've been
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:01.440]  taught that because somebody makes millions and millions of dollars wearing a suit and being on
[03:36:01.440 --> 03:36:07.440]  cable that makes them trustworthy anybody else it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where they are
[03:36:08.160 --> 03:36:14.080]  they automatically cannot be trusted i would say that the anti-warfront therefore is very much like
[03:36:14.080 --> 03:36:19.120]  anti-censorship movement it's very much like independent commentary in general the new rise
[03:36:19.120 --> 03:36:23.280]  of blood sports and they're terrified because they're losing money they're losing audience to
[03:36:23.280 --> 03:36:30.640]  people like you and i and they're they're really bad at youtube let's face it it boils down to
[03:36:30.640 --> 03:36:36.160]  it takes a lot of hard work to actually establish a beachhead on youtube it takes skill it takes
[03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:40.640]  experience to know what kind of headlines to use to know what kind of thumbnails to use
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:46.240]  to know what content to talk about they absolutely suck it across the board i mentioned just before
[03:36:46.240 --> 03:36:51.120]  the break it was an mtv news video from like a couple of weeks ago it had been up a couple of
[03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:57.520]  weeks it had 200 views i mean for god's sake i upload a video i get 200 views in like 10 seconds
[03:36:57.520 --> 03:37:02.960]  and that's why they hate us i mean there was a new york times article last year where i joked
[03:37:02.960 --> 03:37:08.080]  oh youtube is becoming a safe space for right wingers and that seems to be the point where
[03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:13.120]  they really started freaking out about it now we've got this entire contrived moral panic
[03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:19.920]  we had mark warner a senator again last week calling for youtube to change its algorithm
[03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:26.400]  because there were negative videos about hillary clinton god forbid do you think sticks that that's
[03:37:26.400 --> 03:37:30.560]  got anything to do with the fact that she was the most corrupt and unlikable presidential
[03:37:30.560 --> 03:37:37.280]  candidate in history or is it a big conspiracy that youtube needs to fix oh it goes beyond just
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:42.000]  hillary clinton it goes to the establishment at large she's just one part of it a big part
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:47.360]  one of the worst slimyest most outdated crazy parts but it goes well beyond her it's nancy
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:53.360]  polosi chuck schumer it's the john mccain's and people within the republican party too and it's
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:58.960]  also it's not just us it's also people in foreign countries as well definitely it would go to the
[03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:04.000]  establishments that we see in western europe angela merkel would probably be a number one on there
[03:38:04.720 --> 03:38:10.560]  maybe maybe the the macrons and other individuals within france within the uk all over the world
[03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:16.160]  we've got people who want us to die for their money who don't want us to speak freely and and
[03:38:16.160 --> 03:38:21.600]  who quite frankly i think lack the talent necessary to really make it in the online world where it
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:28.640]  isn't just about having a capteeth and a hair plug and a mega corporation a multinational
[03:38:28.640 --> 03:38:33.120]  of billions of dollars behind you it actually requires some degree of talent some degree of
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:38.720]  originality that's something that they never had to have they haven't had that since the 1940s or
[03:38:38.720 --> 03:38:45.040]  50s for the most part well yes it's harder to make a good youtube video that resonates with people
[03:38:45.040 --> 03:38:50.160]  than it is to put out a snarky tweet as a verified liberal which is what they seem to think is is
[03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:54.560]  important it's not really that important anymore it's not really resonating with the younger
[03:38:54.560 --> 03:38:59.840]  generation so i mean that the older cliche you know get good they don't seem to grasp that so they
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:05.120]  want to artificially push everyone else down to lift themselves up which is why we have now youtube
[03:39:05.120 --> 03:39:10.640]  announcing oh we're going to put you know mainstream content at the top of search results on any
[03:39:10.640 --> 03:39:16.880]  hot break in news topic so they're starting to introduce this algorithm which punishes interesting
[03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:22.800]  people and rewards boring people like the people who work for the wall street journal now the CEO
[03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:28.000]  of news corp came out last week again robert tomsen which by the way owns the wall street journal
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:33.360]  of course he called on google and facebook to send a quote misinformation that was his word
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:38.880]  because in his own words i'll read this quote here the potential returns for our journalism
[03:39:38.880 --> 03:39:44.400]  get that again the potential returns for our journalism would be far higher in a less chaotic
[03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:50.240]  less debased digital environment so sticks does that sound like they genuinely want to eradicate
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:56.160]  misinformation or does it sound like they want to make more money by eliminating their competition
[03:39:56.880 --> 03:40:02.160]  they only want to eliminate misinformation that goes against their misinformation they want to be
[03:40:02.160 --> 03:40:08.640]  the only ones who are allowed to make propaganda and spread fake news uh ultimately these groups
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:13.440]  though they've they've coalesced together to the point at which even some groups that are kind of
[03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:18.880]  conservative in form and function are working for the establishment they're really part of
[03:40:18.880 --> 03:40:24.800]  the same group and it's it's ultimately about attacking two groups of people totally independent
[03:40:24.800 --> 03:40:29.520]  content creators and off hook groups that are totally independent you might they might be
[03:40:29.520 --> 03:40:34.400]  businesses like info wars is a business but it's independent it doesn't take its marching orders
[03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:39.840]  from some group that's it's a multinational multi-billion dollar firm then you've got individuals
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:44.800]  who do their own independent analysis as well both of those are grave threats to them otherwise they
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:50.080]  wouldn't be attacking them in the wall street journal is one of the worst of all it's literally
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:55.360]  it should get the award when donald trump didn't give them the the number one award for fake news
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:41:02.320]  it was almost a little bit of a letdown to tell the truth it's absolutely incredible some of these
[03:41:02.320 --> 03:41:07.120]  social justice outfits tend to do actually quite well on facebook in terms of views from what i've
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:13.280]  seen recently but again they're getting completely owned and decimated in the comments this trend is
[03:41:13.280 --> 03:41:18.960]  really increased intensified from my perspective over the past six months definitely where you go
[03:41:18.960 --> 03:41:23.920]  on a viral video that's gone viral because it's absolutely incredibly stupid like for example
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:29.280]  there was a there was a vice show about a black girl a black supremacist basically saying white
[03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:34.320]  people shouldn't be able to you know have passports or travel because she's a racist and vice is
[03:41:34.320 --> 03:41:38.560]  giving her a platform because essentially they're a racist news outlet you go on the youtube you
[03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:44.880]  go on the facebook video thumbs down to infinity getting trashed in the comments they're losing
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:48.960]  the argument so they're having to censor alternative and what is this stuff sticks
[03:41:48.960 --> 03:41:54.400]  in the final minute of this segment why are they censoring 1930s music what's going on there
[03:41:55.760 --> 03:42:00.800]  apparently they feel threatened by it and it's branched out well beyond just political commentary
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:05.520]  you'll look rotten tomatoes which is just entertainment has nothing to do with politics
[03:42:05.520 --> 03:42:10.080]  they're doing exactly the same thing the little people don't have the right to speak unless they're
[03:42:10.080 --> 03:42:13.680]  speaking in a certain way it's sort of like you have the right to vote you have the right to vote
[03:42:13.680 --> 03:42:19.440]  jaw for hitler or something along those lines it's not even really that much of a surprise because
[03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:24.800]  it boils down to money but it has become a problem ultimately i think they fail in the long term
[03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:31.120]  short term they have certainly the upper hand over people like us we have less money all right
[03:42:31.120 --> 03:42:35.920]  we're going to continue sticks in the next segment this is the alex joneshow live breaking news at

[03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:45.920]  again another contrived moral panic over that eventually be used to censor and punish other

[03:47:00.400 --> 03:47:22.240]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph watson
[03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:30.480]  we're back with stick texan hammer 666 we're talking about youtube censorship we're talking
[03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:36.160]  about fake news now most people don't remember the back in december 2016 the washington post had
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:42.640]  to basically retract their list of fake news websites because it was based on a list compiled by a
[03:47:42.640 --> 03:47:50.160]  this far left biased organization prop or not it was not an impartial summary of fake news and
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:56.080]  they've used this buzzword they've used this post truth world moniker ever since the election
[03:47:56.080 --> 03:48:01.920]  again because they're in a blind panic that they no longer have the power to control the narrative
[03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:06.960]  in fact there was a buzzfeed article sticks yesterday um and this was by charlie wasel who's
[03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:11.600]  not a not a bad guy but then he tried to mis characterize what i said about it on twitter
[03:48:11.600 --> 03:48:16.800]  i invite him to come on the show and talk about it and imagine my shock no response whatsoever
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:22.800]  but he talked to a senior government employee who's tasked with studying misinformation who
[03:48:22.800 --> 03:48:28.480]  told him that quote they're expecting for the future a situation where misinformation is
[03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:35.120]  quote a direct threat to the foundations of our current civilization now that no that doesn't
[03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:40.880]  sound hysterical at all he's saying that information which disagrees with the prevailing
[03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:47.840]  establishment narrative is a threat to civilization do you think it sticks it's actually just a threat
[03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:54.400]  to their metropolitan globalist elite narrative control system is that maybe more likely the
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:49:00.080]  scenario we've got here yeah well globalist misinformation is a threat to civilization
[03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:05.200]  they're trying constantly to destroy liberty they're trying constantly to destroy you know
[03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:11.680]  anything that advances progress in the realm of human thinking the idea maybe 20 or 30 years
[03:49:11.680 --> 03:49:16.720]  ago of this many people having this large an audience speaking instantaneously across the
[03:49:16.720 --> 03:49:22.880]  internet was uh it wasn't even in people's wildest dreams they really are are envious i think of the
[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:27.360]  fact that individuals that really didn't have anything to begin with have capitalized upon
[03:49:27.360 --> 03:49:31.920]  that sometimes have millions of fans they want in they want their slice of the pie they want their
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:36.960]  money and so if they can propagandize buzzfeed it would be hard to think of a group other than the
[03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:41.840]  wall street journal or the new york times a few of these groups that's less honest than buzzfeed
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:45.840]  they get away with it only because they have their own audience but i mean honestly their
[03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:50.480]  audience ultimately is small compared to like info wars they've got a very small audience
[03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:56.400]  it's very funny to see them complain because oftentimes these groups they're in decline
[03:49:56.400 --> 03:50:01.200]  they're not even growing they're losing their fans they're not really able to branch out onto
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:07.120]  youtube cnn's had problems mtv news all of these old juggernauts of the legacy media they have
[03:50:07.120 --> 03:50:14.000]  problems really dealing with the tech era and a little bit richer buzzfeed to accuse me of fake
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:19.280]  news given that they were behind the biggest fake news story of last year the trump pgate dossier
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:24.000]  which other organizations who hate a trump didn't even run with because they knew it was phony
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:28.880]  but that's what they're saying now they're still on this jag about fake news oh by the way my youtube
[03:50:28.880 --> 03:50:33.600]  channel the past 11 videos have been demonetized i think that's a new record for me personally i'm
[03:50:33.600 --> 03:50:38.800]  going for 12 with this video so we'll see if that happens but we've seen another contrived moral
[03:50:38.800 --> 03:50:44.720]  panic sticks in terms of youtube on top of the you know extremist content panic which is prank
[03:50:44.720 --> 03:50:50.080]  videos you know we've had prank videos on youtube for 10 years or more you know people have been
[03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:55.600]  doing stupid things logan paul's been an idiot for quite a while now it's not a great revelation
[03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:02.000]  that's been happening on youtube basically since its inception but now suddenly sticks prank videos
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:08.160]  are this huge societal problem and youtube has announced more measures to punish harmful content
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:14.560]  they say as a result tell us about that yeah they've uh all of this stuff's been on youtube
[03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:20.800]  since day one bum fights turrets guy there were people videos literally of people just swearing
[03:51:20.800 --> 03:51:27.360]  and doing crazy stuff like jackass we remember jackass from the 1990s it's really no different
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:32.240]  it's no different than maybe howard stern when he was still being edgy the difference is this
[03:51:32.240 --> 03:51:38.960]  time it's not being made by an individual or a show a small group a very centralized system
[03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:43.600]  they're not the ones making the edgy content now the edgy content is being made by a million
[03:51:43.600 --> 03:51:48.400]  different individuals oh well it becomes a lot harder to stop it that's ultimately why they're
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:53.760]  worried it's the same moral argument for a different generation it's the same boring individuals
[03:51:53.760 --> 03:51:59.360]  making that stupid argument it's just that it's directed now at you know literally a large proportion
[03:51:59.360 --> 03:52:04.720]  of the entire youtube base i can remember when i first got to youtube a lot of the content a lot
[03:52:04.720 --> 03:52:10.080]  of the viral content was really out there grind core videos whose titles would make your toes curl
[03:52:10.080 --> 03:52:14.240]  and that was that was a big thing at the time hundreds of thousands of people which was a lot
[03:52:14.240 --> 03:52:20.480]  back then in 2007 would pile on to these videos to sort of be titillated by these weird weird titles
[03:52:20.480 --> 03:52:27.760]  and these weird images and this strange music that at the time was novel imagine if the same logic
[03:52:27.760 --> 03:52:34.160]  used today by the moralists was applied back in the 90s of the 2000s they would be saying you
[03:52:34.160 --> 03:52:39.520]  would have the left saying no we can't have jackass we can't have heavy metal we can't have this pop
[03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:44.640]  band is too out there too risque for us it's too cis normative and it would be terrible i mean we
[03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:50.000]  wouldn't have culture at all there wouldn't be anything fun no fun music no fun videos no fun
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:54.240]  independent content if people want to maintain that they've got to start fighting back against the
[03:52:54.240 --> 03:53:02.720]  censorship everything is flipped i mean the left truly are the new puritans completely if two people
[03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:07.840]  make a complaint about an advertisement or whatever in this country it gets shut down it gets banned
[03:53:07.840 --> 03:53:12.320]  it's incredible how sensitive they are final question now and we'll tell people how they can
[03:53:12.320 --> 03:53:18.880]  find your channel is the cut is the common refrain you know youtube's a private company it can censor
[03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:24.560]  who it likes how do you respond to that sticks well then a private company should be able to deny
[03:53:24.560 --> 03:53:29.280]  service of any kind to any person that would cause so many problems it wouldn't be pragmatic for our
[03:53:29.280 --> 03:53:34.080]  civilization if they're if they're pretending that they want to maintain western civilization
[03:53:34.080 --> 03:53:38.560]  maintain order people should be nice and tolerant well then you've got to tolerate viewpoints that
[03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:44.400]  you find offensive most of those being censored or who are worried about being censored ultimately
[03:53:44.400 --> 03:53:48.320]  at the end of the day they're not your end and they're not going to start a new nazi party
[03:53:48.320 --> 03:53:53.280]  they're not jackboots they're not trying to crush skulls they're simply trying to tell a bad joke or
[03:53:53.280 --> 03:53:58.000]  do something that's you know funny to them and it's kind of out there and crude but that's been
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:03.760]  happening for a million years and if you applied the same morality that's being applied to these
[03:54:03.760 --> 03:54:08.560]  sort of individuals today to something from 20 years ago the same would be the case it would
[03:54:08.560 --> 03:54:14.080]  ultimately be a fool's errand to try to police morality in 10 years from now the stuff that
[03:54:14.080 --> 03:54:20.320]  they're calling edgy probably won't be considered edgy so you don't think they were at a point now
[03:54:20.320 --> 03:54:25.680]  where google is such a monopoly that it needs some kind of regulation there needs to be incorporated
[03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:31.520]  in some kind of new telecommunications act simply to protect freedom of speech given that it's
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:36.960]  reached a point it's grown so much that google basically is the internet for a lot of people
[03:54:36.960 --> 03:54:43.280]  at this point you don't think we should go to that level of actual regulation i i'm i'm hesitant
[03:54:43.280 --> 03:54:47.520]  to say that i think that something needs to be done i prefer a constitutional amendment that
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:52.640]  doesn't just apply to google or the big tech firms it applies to all tech firms so that it's even
[03:54:52.640 --> 03:54:58.080]  handed it allows competition to continue failing that though at least temporarily we may you're
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:03.120]  right we may have no other choice but to relegate google and some of these other big firms facebook
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:06.400]  probably not because it's dying anyway and you know a couple years to now no one will care who
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:11.200]  zuckerberg is he'll be like homeless uh other than that though twitter and youtube certainly is the
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:17.520]  big ones they they might need to be relegated to public utility status all right we'll wrap it up
