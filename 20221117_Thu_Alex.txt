[00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.698]  It's Thursday, November 17, 2022.
[00:00:06.698 --> 00:00:09.342]  There are so many giant developments.
[00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:16.592]  We're about to hit them all now.
[00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:17.733]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.255]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.606]  There is huge financial news, massive political news, ultra-massive medical news from around the world.
[00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:43.353]  The deep state is having to start World War III, having egg on their face now with the supposed Russian missile fired into Poland.
[00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:46.455]  It is all coming up today with several
[00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.529]  Big, important, informative guest as well.
[00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:54.412]  I'll tell you about next segment, but the first thing I want to start drilling into is
[00:00:56.072 --> 00:01:13.758]  The UN official plan going back to when it was founded in 1946-47, officially in 47, at the Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco, was to get rid of borders and merge countries so there's no culture that has its own culture and its own independence.
[00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:20.600]  And then by the 70s they developed a plan called Replacement Migration to encourage the first world not to have children.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.521]  And then replace them with third world populations that were more easily managed and controlled who never had any history of freedom.
[00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:34.662]  The globalists are in competition with the Western Christian ideal of the Renaissance and upward mobility.
[00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:39.063]  They want you to own nothing and have nothing and like it as they say.
[00:01:39.063 --> 00:01:46.444]  You don't have air conditioning or a car but you don't have heating in the winter but Klaus Schwab has five private jets and that's okay because he's Klaus Schwab.
[00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:49.005]  Well now yesterday, this is really taking the internet by storm,
[00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.362]  We covered it yesterday, but I'm going to get back into it today.
[00:01:51.362 --> 00:01:55.984]  Chuckie Schumer said we need totally open borders because people in America aren't having enough kids.
[00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:57.945]  We've got to replace those that are dying.
[00:01:57.945 --> 00:01:59.286]  Well, I have the official U.N.
[00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.928]  replacement migration plans from just two years ago.
[00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:06.750]  But if you talk about it, you get taken off the Internet because the ADL is God and says that's not allowed.
[00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.831]  Here's Chuckie Schumer yesterday.
[00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:12.945]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers.
[00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:19.969]  We have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to.
[00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:26.933]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers, and all of them.
[00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:35.319]  Because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:46.888]  All right, so here's a brief supercut, there's hours of this, of the Deep Staters and their minions saying you're not allowed to talk about bringing in foreigners to replace a dying population.
[00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:49.391]  Here's that supercut, we'll be right back to watch the full broadcast.
[00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:59.582]  It seems harder and harder to ignore that the echoes of replacement theory and other racially motivated views are increasingly coming out into the open.
[00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:02.664]  In a few years, we're going to be a majority brown country.
[00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:04.986]  White people will not be the majority in the country anymore.
[00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:12.653]  This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a minority of the generation at some point.
[00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:12.853]  As of 2007,
[00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:18.536]  Every year, babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority.
[00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:20.897]  In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.
[00:03:20.897 --> 00:03:25.879]  As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which is coming.
[00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.560]  Demographics is destiny.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.021]  Demographics is destiny.
[00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:30.921]  Demographics is destiny, right?
[00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:32.042]  The country is changing.
[00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:37.469]  I've been saying it here, other people have been saying it here for years now, even before Donald Trump.
[00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.912]  The demographics is destiny.
[00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:47.701]  The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.
[00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:50.365]  So we live in a country where the demographics are changing, it's becoming less white.
[00:03:51.318 --> 00:03:51.799]  Correct.
[00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:52.059]  Okay.
[00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:58.043]  You'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic nominee for president.
[00:03:58.043 --> 00:03:59.123]  It's changing.
[00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:04.287]  It's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of the demographics, because of the population growth.
[00:04:04.287 --> 00:04:11.952]  The growth in Texas has been almost entirely driven by non-white population growth, mostly by Hispanic and Latino population growth.
[00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:16.254]  The idea that, you know, whites will not be the majority
[00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:20.941]  I mean, that's, it's an exciting transformation of the country.
[00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:25.769]  It's an exciting evolution and, you know, progress of our country in many different ways.
[00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:28.012]  The white population is declining.
[00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:31.676]  It was always on the upswing.
[00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:35.637]  So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.
[00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:42.999]  It speaks to how that population will, the demographics, will weigh in politically.
[00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:55.643]  I believe anybody who echoes the replacement name is to blame, not for this particular crime, but it's for no purpose, no purpose, except profit and or political benefit.
[00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:56.823]  And it's wrong.
[00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:57.904]  It's just simply wrong.
[00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:03.098]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:05:03.098 --> 00:05:04.379]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.862]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:09.123]  Why can't we do this here?
[00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:11.666]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:17.531]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:19.513]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[00:05:19.513 --> 00:05:21.415]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:23.336]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:33.926]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[00:05:33.926 --> 00:05:38.070]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.973]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.995]  Communications are the reason why we didn't win.
[00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:47.077]  Well, that's why InfoWars.com is so damn important.
[00:05:47.077 --> 00:05:50.399]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:52.640]  People need to get behind InfoWars.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.903]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[00:05:57.903 --> 00:06:00.445]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:16.017]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.017 --> 00:06:17.738]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:19.399]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:24.542]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:28.904]  And it's the Thursday, November 17th edition.
[00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:37.128]  One of the top, long track record of being extremely accurate economists will be joining us.
[00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:54.069]  Coming up in the third hour, Martin Armstrong, Matt Baker, who's an incredible citizen activist, one of the most powerful speeches at city councils and state legislatures, is going to be popping in and joining us as the model of taking the info war peacefully to the enemy.
[00:06:54.069 --> 00:07:01.852]  We'll also be opening the phones up today and Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room, 3 p.m.
[00:07:01.852 --> 00:07:02.272]  with the great
[00:07:03.254 --> 00:07:06.335]  Owen Schroyer, of course we're here every weekday, 11 a.m.
[00:07:06.335 --> 00:07:06.815]  to 3 p.m.
[00:07:06.815 --> 00:07:20.697]  Central, preceding the incredibly impacting, smart analysis of Harrison Smith and his crew and guests as well with American Journal, 8 a.m.
[00:07:20.697 --> 00:07:21.337]  to 11 a.m.
[00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:21.937]  Central.
[00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:27.338]  Okay.
[00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:28.438]  Let's just do this.
[00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:32.479]  Let me first explain to your TV viewer, not a radio listener, I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:39.996]  While we have a dystopic image of Washington, D.C., an artist's rendering of what D.C.
[00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:50.320]  would look like a few years after it was depopulated by a hydrogen bomb going off over it, an airburst attack.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:08:01.964]  Because that's where this country and where this world is going in the time of insanity that is accelerating and spiraling out of control in Ukraine and that proxy war with NATO, the U.S.
[00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:02.504]  against Russia.
[00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:07.289]  We have the Associated Press doing a retraction yesterday.
[00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:09.150]  We have Reuters doing a retraction.
[00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.490]  We have a bunch of publications doing retractions.
[00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:19.913]  We have Polish government ministers and mayors in the town that got hit and the rest of them coming out and saying, look, it's a Ukrainian missile.
[00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:31.117]  And they've now looked at the trajectory and even Poland admits, I've got the articles right here, that it was shot over 100 miles off course in the wrong direction and not even shot at Russian aircraft.
[00:08:32.498 --> 00:08:47.448]  And probably a provocation by Zelensky, who immediately said it was Russian, and still says it's Russian, and says he won't back down, it's Russian, and then the Secretary of Defense comes out here and says, well it doesn't matter who shot it, it's still Russia's fault.
[00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:55.254]  Because they started the war, but they didn't really start the war, the globalists overthrew the elected government, almost nine years ago there, and we all know what happened since then.
[00:08:56.522 --> 00:09:03.166]  If the Russians were on our doorstep like the West is on their doorstep, I would expect we would be in a war with that proxy state as well.
[00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:04.286]  But they're not in Mexico.
[00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:05.807]  They're not in Canada.
[00:09:05.807 --> 00:09:08.348]  They're over there defending their country.
[00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:12.231]  All Chinese troops are trained and confirmed in Mexico and in Canada.
[00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:20.095]  So that's a real threat setting up their own secret intelligence bases and public police stations across the United States and the rest of the world.
[00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:25.023]  So Polish politician blames Ukraine for missile provocation.
[00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:30.289]  Associated Press issues correction to its fake report which could have kicked off World War III.
[00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:32.131]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:35.775]  But Zelensky is doubling down, saying it was a Russian missile.
[00:09:37.637 --> 00:09:38.598]  Makes a great point.
[00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:47.249]  Going to war over a hoax almost happened yesterday would be consistent with the reasons America got into nearly every other modern war.
[00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:51.274]  World War I, the Lusitania to the Gulf of Tonkin, to the USS Liberty.
[00:09:51.274 --> 00:09:57.021]  Sailor survived that one, busting the scam, but watching friends die.
[00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:16.784]  Cernovich went on to ask, if Alex Jones has to pay $1.5 billion, they're now saying, for questioning Sandy Hook, the judge found me guilty, the jury was just told to decide how guilty, well, what does the mainstream media and Zelensky pay for trying to start World War III on purpose, lying to us?
[00:10:18.376 --> 00:10:20.098]  And again, that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:20.098 --> 00:10:21.279]  They think you're stupid.
[00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.200]  They think you're mindless.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.080]  They think you're idiots.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:33.050]  They think, oh, well, if Jones is found guilty of all these horrible things I didn't do, the judge said I was guilty, jury was told to find out how guilty and how much money, he must be about to go off the air.
[00:10:34.076 --> 00:10:36.037]  Because you can't pay 1.4 million.
[00:10:36.037 --> 00:10:37.519]  There's things called appeals.
[00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:38.960]  We don't have that money.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.701]  There's things called bankruptcy.
[00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:59.214]  But they want to convince you we're going off the air so you give up and don't spread the word about the broadcast when we are the most influential and the most effective we've ever been because we have accurately predicted what would happen up until this point and now what is about to happen in the near and mid and long-term future that is very, very bad if we don't stop it.
[00:11:01.533 --> 00:11:04.255]  There's that whole area.
[00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:13.340]  And then there's this huge stack that is so critical and so important that I'm going to hit, starting here in a moment and into the next segment.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.661]  Chuckie Schumer really captured the attention of the Internet.
[00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:23.685]  It's really the top story out there, just from my perusal of a lot of sites and platforms, that Schumer came out and said that
[00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:32.569]  We need to replace the dying American population that's not having enough children with foreigners.
[00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:33.769]  You use the term replace.
[00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:37.532]  Well, that's an official UN plan, the replacement system.
[00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:46.317]  If you talk about it to show the documents, the ADL calls for you to be taken off air, censored, or put in prison in some speeches.
[00:11:46.317 --> 00:11:53.341]  It's being promoted by the globalists, not just here, but in Europe as well, to bring in permanent underclasses.
[00:11:53.341 --> 00:11:55.823]  We've got all the SPLC reports and the rest of it.
[00:11:56.937 --> 00:12:03.700]  But then meanwhile we have the left all cheering, saying white people are inherently evil and inherently bad and need to be replaced.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:16.567]  So it's just anti-white racism, because the left sees the world as 90% non-white, and so a ruling class of white people can then play racial politics and try to play brown people off against what's left of white people.
[00:12:16.567 --> 00:12:18.848]  It is called divide and conquer, plain and simple.
[00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:21.149]  That is all coming up.
[00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:24.271]  Also, Republicans, it's official, because now the Washington Post says so,
[00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.153]  Win back control of the House with narrow majority.
[00:12:28.153 --> 00:12:31.734]  McConnell re-elected Senate GOP leader not going anywhere.
[00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:35.877]  Nancy Pelosi announced future plans for GOP wins the House.
[00:12:35.877 --> 00:12:38.458]  House Republicans launch Hunter Biden probe.
[00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:41.640]  Alleged president played active role in Sun's business dealings.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.861]  Well, it's in all the damn emails and videos and audio recordings.
[00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:48.523]  They were directly under the command of the head of Chinese intelligence.
[00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:50.224]  That's all confirmed.
[00:12:50.224 --> 00:12:53.046]  House Republicans allege Biden directly involved in business dealings with Sun.
[00:12:53.826 --> 00:12:59.467]  Hunter, now they'll also allege that the sky is blue and the birds fly in the air and say, tweet, tweet, tweet.
[00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:01.587]  So we're going to be going over all of that today.
[00:13:01.587 --> 00:13:13.049]  And then more incredible announcements out of the G20 meeting of world government, world taxes, world surveillance, carbon taxes, vaccine passports, just incredible.
[00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:22.311]  But then even on their own Twitter and Instagram sites run by the WEF, the ADL comes in and says, now this doesn't exist.
[00:13:24.087 --> 00:13:24.928]  They actually run it.
[00:13:24.928 --> 00:13:29.553]  And they put an announcement up saying there's no world government and there's no new world order.
[00:13:29.553 --> 00:13:31.456]  So simultaneously, that's 1984.
[00:13:31.456 --> 00:13:33.478]  World government's good.
[00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:34.339]  It's going to run your life.
[00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:35.661]  It's going to totally take control of you.
[00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:36.221]  You'll own nothing.
[00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:38.044]  You'll have nothing.
[00:13:38.044 --> 00:13:39.165]  And you're going to be replaced.
[00:13:39.165 --> 00:13:40.446]  But if you don't like it,
[00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.732]  We're going to replace you faster and shut your bank account off.
[00:13:44.732 --> 00:13:45.812]  Absolutely insane.
[00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:48.593]  I've got a bunch of key clubs and information on that front.
[00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:57.975]  And speaking of censorship, we all saw when Google, parent company of YouTube, brought down a Kanye West drink champs interview.
[00:13:57.975 --> 00:14:04.057]  Well, now they're going on to Google servers and into people's servers that they think is their private Google
[00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:05.727]  I think?
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:36.565]  This is the next level of big tech total censorship while they want everything on the cloud so they can delete everything in real time in a high-tech version of Joe Stalin, famously airbrushing out political opposition that he'd had killed or sent to the gulags from newspapers and from other publications.
[00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:40.866]  So that's all coming up today and so much more.
[00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:43.952]  And as I said, I'll also be taking phone calls.
[00:14:43.952 --> 00:14:52.604]  Please don't forget, Christmas is almost here and you should do your Christmas shopping earlier and get great products that enrich yourself, your immune system, and your overall.
[00:14:53.590 --> 00:15:01.433]  Lifestyle and you should do your Christmas shopping now because I can tell you we're going to keep the giant sale going for at least a few more weeks until everything sells out.
[00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:02.473]  It's the Mega Blowout.
[00:15:02.473 --> 00:15:09.315]  Black Friday comes early sale up to 60% off at InfoWarsTore.com with promo code 1776 at checkout.
[00:15:09.315 --> 00:15:20.899]  And despite the fact we're going to sell out of Vitamin Mineral Fusion, X3, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Vitamin D3 Gummies with Zinc, Vazobeats, Alpha Power, Brain Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra,
[00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:24.742]  Ultra 12, the highest quality B12 you can find anywhere, take it out of the tongue.
[00:15:24.742 --> 00:15:29.466]  Despite the fact it's all selling out very quickly, we're going to keep it on sale until it sells out.
[00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:32.148]  It'll be months until more comes in, but we need the funds now.
[00:15:32.148 --> 00:15:38.913]  And I appreciate the viewers and the listeners and all of your incredible support to take advantage of these big sales while these products last.
[00:15:38.913 --> 00:15:40.915]  We'll continue mega sales right through Christmas, but
[00:15:41.095 --> 00:15:42.296]  Almost everything will be gone.
[00:15:42.296 --> 00:15:43.877]  You won't be able to get it at those prices.
[00:15:43.877 --> 00:15:50.942]  So now is the time to act, to support the broadcast, boost your immune system, have a better life, be healthier, and also not battle crowds and the rest of it.
[00:15:50.942 --> 00:15:56.887]  Support the broadcast, do your Christmas shopping, give friends and family the great products from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:07.803]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:16:07.803 --> 00:16:19.012]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:19.732]  I think?
[00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:40.792]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.053]  Black Friday comes early.
[00:16:42.053 --> 00:16:50.319]  Use promo code 1776 and get up to 60% off on these best-selling products at infowarestore.com.
[00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:51.259]  Biggest sale of the year.
[00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:52.920]  Promo code 1776.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.041]  Up to 60% off.
[00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:59.745]  Take action now and empower your body.
[00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:04.308]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:08.924]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:14.929]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:18.471]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:19.311]  It's game over.
[00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:25.015]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[00:17:25.015 --> 00:17:29.617]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[00:17:29.617 --> 00:17:35.761]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:48.227]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsTore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[00:17:48.227 --> 00:17:54.330]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.151]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:10.927]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:18:10.927 --> 00:18:12.828]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:18:12.828 --> 00:18:14.288]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:15.789]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:17.530]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.791]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:20.172]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:18:20.592 --> 00:18:25.436]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:18:25.436 --> 00:18:27.838]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:29.860]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:36.806]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:42.829]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:51.774]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:18:51.774 --> 00:18:57.937]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:05.689]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:19:05.689 --> 00:19:12.093]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:17.237]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:19:17.237 --> 00:19:18.938]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:19:18.938 --> 00:19:20.138]  Yes, I've persevered.
[00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:25.342]  But the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:19:26.062 --> 00:19:31.506]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:19:31.506 --> 00:19:35.648]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:19:35.648 --> 00:19:45.054]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:19:45.054 --> 00:19:46.415]  God bless you all.
[00:19:46.415 --> 00:19:47.456]  I salute you.
[00:19:47.456 --> 00:19:48.376]  I thank you.
[00:19:48.376 --> 00:19:53.900]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.902]  The fight is my fight.
[00:19:55.902 --> 00:19:56.523]  It's your fight.
[00:19:56.523 --> 00:19:57.264]  It's our fight.
[00:19:57.264 --> 00:19:58.045]  God bless you all.
[00:20:15.865 --> 00:20:21.927]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to bore you with all the attacks that we're under, not just publicly, but behind the scenes.
[00:20:21.927 --> 00:20:27.509]  But your prayers and support of this broadcast are so critical.
[00:20:27.509 --> 00:20:34.971]  And the tactics they're using against Infowars, they're planning to use against you and your family under their world government plan we'll be getting to next segment.
[00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:36.752]  But imagine the mind control.
[00:20:37.717 --> 00:20:57.486]  The arrogant brainwashing, they think we're so stupid, that I could play you hours, you've all seen it, of every leftist talk show and mainline talk show in America, ABC, NBC, CBS, NPR, Washington Post, your local newspaper, saying white people are inherently evil.
[00:20:57.486 --> 00:21:07.091]  And all this asinine garbage run by the deep state, run by Hollywood, and then saying it's so good that white people will soon disappear, that will create virtue.
[00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:11.890]  Well, Hitler said that certain groups didn't have virtue and deserved to die.
[00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.450]  That's what the left's basically saying today.
[00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.670]  In fact, we all need to die.
[00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.451]  There's too many of us.
[00:21:15.451 --> 00:21:16.691]  Support the babies.
[00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:19.011]  Sterilize people under transgenderism.
[00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:25.853]  Push, not just government sponsored, but government forced and bullied euthanasia.
[00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:27.073]  Forced suicide.
[00:21:27.073 --> 00:21:29.354]  Government murder.
[00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:31.634]  So they're the bad guys.
[00:21:31.634 --> 00:21:35.675]  And they wrap themselves in this leftist liberal mantle of holier than thou.
[00:21:37.731 --> 00:21:46.855]  And countless newscasts, countless ADL and Southern Primary Law Center press conferences, that if people talk about replacement migration, they are Nazis.
[00:21:46.855 --> 00:21:50.657]  But it's an official UN plan since they got founded in the late 40s.
[00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:52.837]  It's in documents since then, over and over again.
[00:21:52.837 --> 00:21:55.299]  I'll show you some in a moment.
[00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:58.320]  But this clip has gone viral of Chuckie Schumer
[00:21:59.522 --> 00:22:06.609]  Saying we need to replace Americans that aren't reproducing with third world populations, a permanent underclass.
[00:22:06.609 --> 00:22:12.175]  They control who they say will then vote Democrat and keep them in power.
[00:22:12.175 --> 00:22:14.397]  The globalists in the EU are using the same tactics.
[00:22:14.397 --> 00:22:15.559]  So here's Chuckie Schumer yesterday.
[00:22:16.914 --> 00:22:20.875]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers.
[00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:27.916]  We have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to.
[00:22:27.916 --> 00:22:34.878]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers, and all of them.
[00:22:34.878 --> 00:22:43.240]  Because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[00:22:44.682 --> 00:22:47.844]  And advertise all this free stuff if you get to Europe or the United States.
[00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:54.669]  But then citizens, like David Icke, if they criticize forced injections, he can't travel to Europe.
[00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:56.191]  And similar things here.
[00:22:56.191 --> 00:22:57.031]  You can't travel.
[00:22:57.031 --> 00:22:58.973]  You can't leave your house if they say you can't.
[00:22:58.973 --> 00:23:03.436]  But everybody else can just come on, come on, come on, come on.
[00:23:03.436 --> 00:23:05.137]  So let's show some of the documents.
[00:23:05.137 --> 00:23:05.898]  Great replacement.
[00:23:05.898 --> 00:23:10.701]  Schumer calls for blanking amnesty of millions of illegals to offset declining US population.
[00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:13.804]  It has all the videos, all the links, and the UN documents.
[00:23:15.137 --> 00:23:16.619]  Therefore, you revealed U.N.
[00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:18.922]  plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:23:18.922 --> 00:23:19.683]  That's their number.
[00:23:19.683 --> 00:23:20.064]  That's from 2018.
[00:23:20.064 --> 00:23:25.371]  We were the first to really break this big, but it was out of the public consciousness.
[00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:28.475]  And national media attackers have said we were evil and we were bad.
[00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:31.319]  It wasn't true, but they never actually fact-checked the documents.
[00:23:32.352 --> 00:23:33.893]  And here are the documents.
[00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:37.474]  The UN is pushing the Dangerous Replacement Migration Conspiracy Theory.
[00:23:37.474 --> 00:23:40.376]  But it's good when they actually push it as a reality.
[00:23:40.376 --> 00:23:42.937]  Here's one of the documents from the year 2000.
[00:23:42.937 --> 00:23:46.599]  Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations.
[00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:49.640]  You can read the whole report for yourself.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.341]  And it goes on and on.
[00:23:51.341 --> 00:23:54.822]  Southern Poverty Law Center, The Racist Great Replacement Theory Explained.
[00:23:54.822 --> 00:23:55.463]  Doesn't exist.
[00:23:55.463 --> 00:23:56.743]  It's white supremacist.
[00:23:56.743 --> 00:23:58.224]  You're totally insane if you talk about it.
[00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:06.160]  There's another executive summary from the UN pushing it with their framework for replacement migration.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.342]  It's their word.
[00:24:07.342 --> 00:24:08.823]  It's their name.
[00:24:08.823 --> 00:24:17.073]  And then the mind control is so great, you're not supposed to talk about it when they do it in your face.
[00:24:17.073 --> 00:24:19.215]  Here's the UN document yet again.
[00:24:19.215 --> 00:24:20.357]  I suggest everybody go read it.
[00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:41.716]  But also, if you criticize forced injections or lockdowns, the ADL says you're a white supremacist and gives Albert Bourla, the head of Pfizer, who forced this deadly Joseph Mingela shot on us, probably have the Nuremberg Code, literally Joseph Mingela 2.0, but you're a Nazi if you don't let us inside your body to control what you're doing.
[00:24:41.716 --> 00:24:46.139]  This is an invasion of our bodies, an invasion of our sovereignty, a total takeover.
[00:24:46.139 --> 00:24:46.680]  But don't worry.
[00:24:47.677 --> 00:25:05.531]  FDX gave more than 30 million dollars running its own fake studies to then create fake studies so they could try to ban hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and more and the ADL backed them up too and said you're anti-semitic if you talk about any type of alternate treatment.
[00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.171]  You don't like open borders.
[00:25:08.171 --> 00:25:12.716]  If you question elections, if you question forced injections, you are a Nazi.
[00:25:12.716 --> 00:25:19.064]  That's the official Joe Biden battle plan from June of 2021 as well.
[00:25:19.064 --> 00:25:20.065]  But they've got a problem.
[00:25:20.065 --> 00:25:27.753]  Even NBC News admits anti-vaxxers were right in that the shots are causing a hundred times plus, not a hundred percent, one hundred
[00:25:28.874 --> 00:25:36.381]  Times increase in heart attacks, myocarditis, and then here's a whole other report on that as well.
[00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:51.215]  But it's okay because the UN has all these propaganda commercials that I'm going to air when we come back, telling you how fashionable and how incredibly cool it is for everybody to be under this and to live under these systems.
[00:25:52.998 --> 00:25:54.218]  This is all UN directed.
[00:25:54.218 --> 00:26:06.863]  I remember in 2017, there was a big NBC headline, there was a Reuters headline as well, that both showed George Soros with the head of the UN Replacement Migration Program.
[00:26:08.035 --> 00:26:24.967]  The refugee program saying, oh, we give multi-thousand euro, multi-thousand dollar cards without any names on it to people to get them out of their countries in the Middle East and Africa and poor areas of Asia, Latin America, into Europe, into the United States.
[00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:30.892]  And then we've massed them at UN refugee centers near the border and then flood the borders.
[00:26:30.892 --> 00:26:35.235]  Meanwhile, here in the US, we already have open borders, but it will supercharge that flooding.
[00:26:36.482 --> 00:26:49.370]  It'll turbocharge it if they get rid of Title 42, which Biden says he is, where the government won't even have the power if you are a convicted felon, a pedophile, an arsonist, a murderer, to deport you.
[00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:55.975]  No power to deport, basically, period, beyond castrating what's left of ICE.
[00:26:55.975 --> 00:26:57.456]  And then ICE will be used to keep us in.
[00:26:59.625 --> 00:27:04.032]  And it is a domestic control system with the TSA they've already announced to be on the streets of America.
[00:27:04.032 --> 00:27:11.825]  But everybody else can come to the country, you just can't get out of the country unless you are a good little globalist.
[00:27:11.825 --> 00:27:13.287]  So that's all coming up.
[00:27:14.306 --> 00:27:18.747]  In the next segment, straight ahead, Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:27:36.292 --> 00:27:39.094]  Weird written instructions like he's a dog.
[00:27:39.094 --> 00:27:39.814]  You will walk.
[00:27:39.814 --> 00:27:40.535]  You will sit.
[00:27:40.535 --> 00:27:41.215]  You will talk.
[00:27:41.215 --> 00:27:41.855]  You will read.
[00:27:41.855 --> 00:27:42.516]  You will get up.
[00:27:42.516 --> 00:27:43.997]  You will walk to the left.
[00:27:43.997 --> 00:27:55.684]  And Biden mumbles over all of these, showing the true puppet behavior we're dealing with in another video of the new puppet prime minister in the UK with the puppet leader Trudeau calling Zelensky up.
[00:27:55.684 --> 00:27:57.605]  They look like two schoolgirls.
[00:27:57.605 --> 00:27:59.246]  So they're giggling and snickering.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.720]  Well, they do it.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.921]  And we're going to get back into FTX.
[00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:11.882]  They now have the chapter bankruptcy trustee that ran the Enron takeover has now taken over FTX.
[00:28:11.882 --> 00:28:14.903]  And he says it's worse than even Enron.
[00:28:14.903 --> 00:28:18.143]  He's never seen anything this bad.
[00:28:18.143 --> 00:28:21.684]  Total fraud, total money laundering, total scam.
[00:28:21.684 --> 00:28:25.925]  But don't worry, it'll all get swept under the rug, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:27.085 --> 00:28:29.427]  So, that's who these people are.
[00:28:29.427 --> 00:28:37.273]  They lie to you with the elections they steal, and with the PCR tests that are a fraud, and with the central banks, and with the hijacking of cryptocurrencies.
[00:28:37.273 --> 00:28:40.256]  Everything they do is just a lawless criminal operation.
[00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:47.081]  But, it was the internet that exposed Sam Bankman fried, and fried their big operation.
[00:28:47.081 --> 00:28:53.987]  We'll continue to fry everything these criminals are up to, and that's why they're so upset, and that's why they're so scared.

[00:29:31.856 --> 00:29:32.996]  Again, organic.
[00:29:32.996 --> 00:29:34.557]  Vitamin C.

[00:29:35.838 --> 00:29:37.559]  This is the Linus Pauling formula.
[00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.299]  You want it.
[00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:39.720]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.761]  And the list goes on and on.

[00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:55.235]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[00:29:55.235 --> 00:29:58.238]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[00:29:59.147 --> 00:30:07.712]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[00:30:07.712 --> 00:30:17.337]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[00:30:17.337 --> 00:30:18.998]  And that's the problem.
[00:30:18.998 --> 00:30:21.759]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:24.541]  They illegally changed state elections.
[00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:30.964]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[00:30:30.964 --> 00:30:32.985]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[00:30:32.985 --> 00:30:37.247]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[00:30:37.247 --> 00:30:52.354]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[00:30:53.515 --> 00:30:55.218]  Shouldn't be run the way they are.
[00:30:55.218 --> 00:30:56.601]  We're not election deniers.
[00:30:56.601 --> 00:30:57.943]  We're election realists.
[00:31:01.952 --> 00:31:04.793]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[00:31:04.793 --> 00:31:06.833]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:08.834]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[00:31:08.834 --> 00:31:10.895]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[00:31:10.895 --> 00:31:12.635]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[00:31:12.635 --> 00:31:15.016]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.

[00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:20.437]  And you constantly forget.
[00:31:20.437 --> 00:31:22.378]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[00:31:23.058 --> 00:31:26.280]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[00:31:59.457 --> 00:32:01.698]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[00:32:01.698 --> 00:32:05.701]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[00:32:05.701 --> 00:32:07.022]  There's a solution.
[00:32:07.022 --> 00:32:08.022]  The Wellness Company.
[00:32:08.022 --> 00:32:11.304]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:18.529]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:44.840]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[00:32:45.942 --> 00:32:46.423]  I think so.
[00:33:23.625 --> 00:33:28.867]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:37.012]  So, a few weeks ago, the mouth of the New World Order, Atlantic Monthly Magazine, um, that old Jeffrey Epstein crew,
[00:33:38.888 --> 00:33:45.151]  They came out and said, we want amnesty from making you wear a mask and trying to inject you in lockdowns.
[00:33:45.151 --> 00:33:45.871]  We're sorry.
[00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:46.912]  Please don't attack us.
[00:33:46.912 --> 00:33:48.092]  Don't sue us.
[00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:48.893]  Don't criticize us.
[00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.934]  They know we've reached critical mass.
[00:33:50.934 --> 00:33:54.195]  The organizations, the movements, the scientists, the doctors, all the evidence is coming out.
[00:33:54.195 --> 00:33:55.496]  They killed us on purpose.
[00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:56.356]  They created the virus.
[00:33:56.356 --> 00:33:56.876]  They released it.
[00:33:56.876 --> 00:34:01.919]  The shots grow nanoparticles in the body that create all these blood clots, basically mad cow disease.
[00:34:02.899 --> 00:34:03.520]  We're good to go.
[00:34:21.841 --> 00:34:27.505]  Just a few hours, the little nanoparticles need to be in your hot body to live and spread, they die.
[00:34:27.505 --> 00:34:33.169]  So most folks got dead shots because of the incompetency of the system and their minions.
[00:34:33.169 --> 00:34:35.330]  So that worked against them, so the kill rate was much lower.
[00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.072]  Still off the charts bad.
[00:34:38.072 --> 00:34:45.177]  Meanwhile, they're running TV ads in the US and TV ads in Europe and everywhere.
[00:34:45.177 --> 00:34:48.098]  And I was in a hotel room
[00:34:49.136 --> 00:35:05.920]  A few weeks ago at the Texas coast with my wife and five-year-old taking a few days off and I said okay let's let's let her watch some children's cartoons let's see what's on so we were watching on some cartoon channel on old Bugs Bunny show but when it went to break
[00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:13.033]  It was Elmo saying you need to take your shot or you'll die.
[00:35:13.033 --> 00:35:15.035]  Which you're not supposed to target children with advertising.
[00:35:15.035 --> 00:35:16.456]  It's lying to them.
[00:35:16.456 --> 00:35:21.200]  It's saying once you take the shot it's safe and you'll be protected.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.882]  So that's Elmo targeting children.
[00:35:23.882 --> 00:35:36.713]  And the ads are out there we've already covered them but it was just sitting there in a hotel room by the beach watching a puppet tell your children to take a poison
[00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.771]  Joseph Mingala.
[00:35:39.771 --> 00:35:43.732]  Death Shot was just next level.
[00:35:43.732 --> 00:35:45.552]  And it's going on.
[00:35:45.552 --> 00:35:46.532]  It's going on everywhere.
[00:35:46.532 --> 00:35:48.453]  In fact, they found the ads.
[00:35:48.453 --> 00:35:49.373]  Once you got audio, let me know.
[00:35:49.373 --> 00:35:53.354]  We'll actually play it since I mentioned it.
[00:35:53.354 --> 00:35:57.215]  It's a great job just within seconds of me mentioning something, finding something.
[00:35:57.215 --> 00:35:59.556]  So I'm sitting there watching them target my daughters.
[00:35:59.556 --> 00:36:00.416]  We turn the TV off.
[00:36:00.416 --> 00:36:06.858]  We're like, my God, can't watch an old Warner Brothers show with Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny because the ads are weaponized pure evil.
[00:36:07.947 --> 00:36:09.768]  During the breaks.
[00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:11.368]  This is just everywhere.
[00:36:11.368 --> 00:36:20.933]  And so we're the only country in the world that's saying, mandated for schools, five and up, six months and old, authorized, when it erases your immune system and does all this.
[00:36:20.933 --> 00:36:35.539]  But then meanwhile, we have the UN running ads targeting women, with a woman kind of dressed up in a vampire outfit, with a vial of the so-called COVID vaccine, the spike protein replicating nanotech,
[00:36:37.077 --> 00:36:50.308]  And she's in her little Vogue outfit with the quote, COVID-19 vaccine, saying how sexy and cool and what a luxury it is to have a heart attack or get microcarditis or have your ovaries destroyed.
[00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:52.510]  Of course, they don't tell you that.
[00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.994]  They say, let's make the vaccine accessible for everyone, not just the rich.
[00:36:56.994 --> 00:37:00.397]  So they're making it like a Diamonds Forever commercial.
[00:37:00.397 --> 00:37:04.180]  We've got another ad out of Canada, Canadian child vaccine ad.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:26.157]  And it shows children as these dirty little spit creatures that are spreading germs and disease, and even though they don't get sick from COVID, they're monsters if you haven't erased their immune system and given them this deadly shot, because they're gonna make you sick, these little criminals, these little dirty monsters, if you don't shoot them up with this.
[00:37:26.157 --> 00:37:28.158]  So absolutely, truly sickening.
[00:37:28.158 --> 00:37:32.222]  Let's go ahead and air these propaganda Joseph Mingala advertisements back-to-back.
[00:37:38.416 --> 00:37:42.919]  By the way, this comes as Pfizer just raised the price of the shot to create the scarcity idea.
[00:37:42.919 --> 00:37:44.459]  Artificial scarcity over 100 times.
[00:38:08.652 --> 00:38:13.256]  Look at that evil child.
[00:38:13.256 --> 00:38:18.239]  You think they're nice, but they're disease carriers.
[00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:21.302]  We gotta control them now.
[00:38:21.302 --> 00:38:23.543]  Give them the shot.
[00:38:23.543 --> 00:38:26.085]  Give them the slow death.
[00:38:26.085 --> 00:38:26.986]  Give them the future.
[00:38:26.986 --> 00:38:27.526]  What a loving,
[00:38:33.854 --> 00:38:35.716]  Loving system.
[00:38:35.716 --> 00:38:41.743]  And there's so many mystery chemicals and weird nanotech toxins in the shots.
[00:38:41.743 --> 00:38:48.650]  Turns out by the company Jeffrey Epstein created and ran with secret genomic manipulation, what could go wrong?
[00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.816]  Toxic vaccine ingredient SM-102 created by Epstein's genome project.
[00:38:55.643 --> 00:38:56.224]  Isn't that liberal?
[00:38:56.224 --> 00:38:56.764]  Isn't that loving?
[00:38:56.764 --> 00:38:59.187]  And then like all these ads for the black community.
[00:38:59.187 --> 00:39:00.128]  I got the vaccine.
[00:39:00.128 --> 00:39:01.410]  You got the vaccine.
[00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:07.056]  You need to get the vaccine so we'll be protected.
[00:39:07.056 --> 00:39:10.320]  Here's the Elmo ad and then we'll play the Run DMC ad.
[00:39:13.788 --> 00:39:17.630]  Daddy has super-duper bandages, just like Elmo!
[00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:22.292]  You were super-duper today, getting your COVID vaccine, Elmo.
[00:39:22.292 --> 00:39:24.693]  Yeah, there was a little pinch, but it was okay.
[00:39:24.693 --> 00:39:29.116]  Elmo was really glad to have Daddy and Baby David there with him.
[00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:31.957]  Baby David, where are you?
[00:39:31.957 --> 00:39:35.759]  I had a lot of questions about Elmo getting the COVID vaccine.
[00:39:35.759 --> 00:39:37.019]  Was it safe?
[00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:39.080]  Was it the right decision?
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.322]  I talked to our pediatrician so I could make the right choice.
[00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:53.058]  I learned that Elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep himself, our friends, neighbors, and everyone else healthy and enjoying the things they love.
[00:39:53.058 --> 00:39:53.598]  Oh, Daddy!
[00:39:53.598 --> 00:39:56.741]  Elmo and baby David have a question.
[00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:58.362]  Can we have a hug?
[00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:00.584]  Oh, come here, son.
[00:40:00.584 --> 00:40:01.885]  Elmo loves you, Daddy.
[00:40:01.885 --> 00:40:04.087]  I love you, too.
[00:40:04.087 --> 00:40:07.690]  It's okay to have questions about COVID vaccines for your kids.
[00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.193]  Get the latest facts by speaking to your pediatrician or healthcare provider.
[00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:14.044]  You got the vaccine.
[00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.306]  They got the vaccine.
[00:40:15.306 --> 00:40:17.269]  We got the vaccine.
[00:40:17.269 --> 00:40:18.891]  We can get back to normal.
[00:40:18.891 --> 00:40:20.093]  Let me inform you.
[00:40:20.093 --> 00:40:22.156]  Let's all get the vaccine.
[00:40:22.156 --> 00:40:24.820]  It's about community immunity.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.302]  I'm talking unity for you and me.
[00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:29.962]  Doc says it's good, trust me, it's good.
[00:40:29.962 --> 00:40:32.583]  Now let's all get the vaccine.
[00:40:32.583 --> 00:40:34.003]  There is none higher.
[00:40:34.003 --> 00:40:36.504]  DMC, I will inspire.
[00:40:36.504 --> 00:40:38.864]  Time for us to trust and not debate.
[00:40:38.864 --> 00:40:41.045]  The vaccine, believe it's safe to take.
[00:40:41.045 --> 00:40:43.785]  9 out of 10 people won't get sick.
[00:40:43.785 --> 00:40:46.346]  That's 90% effective and legit.
[00:40:46.346 --> 00:40:48.906]  This COVID thing is real and it will find you.
[00:40:48.906 --> 00:40:51.467]  It's killing our people, let me remind you.
[00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:52.927]  Back in the days, back
[00:40:55.782 --> 00:40:59.244]  And then they created a bunch of other ads with Romney and Seaworth's like...
[00:41:19.212 --> 00:41:25.136]  The Nazis want to kill us with eugenics too, and Tuskegee as well, but I'm not going to let them fool you!
[00:41:25.136 --> 00:41:29.379]  You stop the Nazis and the white supremacists, take the shot, and we're going to win!
[00:41:29.379 --> 00:41:31.041]  I mean, seriously.
[00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:36.204]  Meanwhile, it's the literal globalists running the attack that are doing it.
[00:41:36.204 --> 00:41:38.586]  It's just insane.
[00:41:38.586 --> 00:41:44.831]  If you don't let them Joseph Mengele you and take over your body and give you illegal experimental shots and bully you or force you into it, you're a Nazi.
[00:41:47.418 --> 00:41:51.640]  By the way, the crew did a great job finding the Elmo ad, but that's not the Elmo ad I saw.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.301]  In fact, I meant to tell you guys this at the time, but I didn't.
[00:41:54.301 --> 00:41:55.681]  Go search the Elmo ads.
[00:41:55.681 --> 00:41:58.543]  It's an ad with an older black man, the grandpa.
[00:41:58.543 --> 00:42:00.704]  And he goes, I didn't trust it.
[00:42:00.704 --> 00:42:03.625]  People lied to me and told me it wasn't good.
[00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:08.867]  But then I checked the facts with a pediatrician and learned it totally protects you and is totally safe.
[00:42:08.867 --> 00:42:11.968]  So now I gave it to my granddaughter and she's safe.
[00:42:11.968 --> 00:42:12.769]  All lies.
[00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:13.989]  Doesn't protect you.
[00:42:13.989 --> 00:42:14.890]  Experimental.
[00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:15.210]  Alive.
[00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:26.877]  I heard people lying out there, but I went and I talked to the pediatrician that's bought off and paid off a criminal piece of garbage, and they told me it's safe.
[00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:30.519]  Now, my granddaughter had a heart attack and is dead now, but that's okay.
[00:42:30.519 --> 00:42:33.401]  Of course, he didn't say that.
[00:42:33.401 --> 00:42:34.982]  Elmo's like, that's right!
[00:42:34.982 --> 00:42:36.643]  Give it to your granddaughter!
[00:42:36.643 --> 00:42:37.083]  It's good!
[00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:42.871]  Man, oh man.
[00:42:42.871 --> 00:42:49.058]  Alright, world government, digital currency, all out in the open, huge developments on that front.
[00:42:49.058 --> 00:42:50.159]  Man, these people are evil.
[00:42:50.159 --> 00:42:51.400]  They are depopulating us.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.863]  That's their goal, that's their mission, and they're following through with it.
[00:42:54.863 --> 00:42:56.125]  You are targeted for death.
[00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:01.691]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:43:01.691 --> 00:43:02.972]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:43:02.972 --> 00:43:06.457]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[00:43:06.457 --> 00:43:07.738]  Why can't we do this here?
[00:43:07.738 --> 00:43:10.282]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[00:43:10.282 --> 00:43:16.149]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:18.111]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:20.032]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[00:43:20.032 --> 00:43:21.954]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[00:43:21.954 --> 00:43:32.524]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[00:43:32.524 --> 00:43:36.687]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[00:43:36.687 --> 00:43:39.570]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.752]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[00:43:41.992 --> 00:43:45.675]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[00:43:45.675 --> 00:43:48.998]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[00:43:48.998 --> 00:43:51.240]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.504]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[00:43:56.504 --> 00:43:59.046]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[00:44:00.868 --> 00:44:05.773]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:12.158]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:44:12.158 --> 00:44:17.283]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:44:17.283 --> 00:44:19.005]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:44:19.005 --> 00:44:20.286]  Yes, I've persevered.
[00:44:20.286 --> 00:44:25.431]  But the listeners and viewers who've supported Infowars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:44:26.131 --> 00:44:31.576]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:44:31.576 --> 00:44:35.899]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:44:35.899 --> 00:44:45.127]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:44:45.127 --> 00:44:46.488]  God bless you all.
[00:44:46.488 --> 00:44:47.528]  I salute you.
[00:44:47.528 --> 00:44:48.609]  I thank you.
[00:44:48.609 --> 00:44:53.994]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:44:54.634 --> 00:44:55.957]  The fight is my fight.
[00:44:55.957 --> 00:44:56.598]  It's your fight.
[00:44:56.598 --> 00:44:57.320]  It's our fight.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.121]  God bless you all.
[00:45:00.885 --> 00:45:05.769]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:12.174]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:45:12.174 --> 00:45:17.318]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:45:17.318 --> 00:45:19.020]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:25.445]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:45:26.145 --> 00:45:31.587]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:45:31.587 --> 00:45:35.549]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:44.913]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:45:44.913 --> 00:45:46.494]  God bless you all.
[00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:47.434]  I salute you.
[00:45:47.434 --> 00:45:48.174]  I thank you.
[00:45:48.174 --> 00:45:53.977]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:45:54.617 --> 00:45:55.979]  The fight is my fight.
[00:45:55.979 --> 00:45:56.600]  It's your fight.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.341]  It's our fight.
[00:45:57.341 --> 00:45:58.122]  God bless you all.
[00:46:09.889 --> 00:46:14.772]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:18.314]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[00:46:18.314 --> 00:46:19.154]  It's game over.
[00:46:19.154 --> 00:46:24.858]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[00:46:24.858 --> 00:46:29.460]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:35.604]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[00:46:36.084 --> 00:46:48.072]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[00:46:48.072 --> 00:46:54.176]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:54.176 --> 00:46:55.997]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:06.749]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:34.667 --> 00:47:39.949]  When I get up here on air and I explain these people want to depopulate you, they want to kill you, they've all said it themselves.
[00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:42.090]  And I wish this wasn't the case.
[00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.291]  I wish this wasn't real.
[00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:52.074]  But I have serious discussions with my father, my mother, my wife, and my older children on a weekly basis.
[00:47:53.228 --> 00:48:07.653]  About do they stand with me staying on air and trying to stop this and believing in you and betting on you that we can mobilize and organize and let the globalists know we're aware of your plans, we understand your operations, and you're going to be held accountable when you do this.
[00:48:07.653 --> 00:48:10.094]  Now, I wasn't just saying that this last few years.
[00:48:10.094 --> 00:48:13.475]  I said it before they launched the COVID attack.
[00:48:13.475 --> 00:48:21.318]  And I specifically said they're going to release a new hybrid virus, a chimeric virus, out of China that will be the pretext for testing their world government
[00:48:22.346 --> 00:48:22.826]  Thank you.
[00:48:41.892 --> 00:48:43.093]  So I want to explain something.
[00:48:43.093 --> 00:48:54.419]  They are locked and loaded to release super weapons and kill the majority of us if they think they can organize it and have us stay in our houses and basically slowly die.
[00:48:54.419 --> 00:48:56.180]  Guaranteed.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:05.525]  And I don't care if you're an FBI agent, I don't care if you're a federal judge, I don't care if you're a talk show host, I don't care if you're a school teacher, a factory worker, a farmer, an auto mechanic.
[00:49:06.818 --> 00:49:17.081]  A masseuse, a psychologist, you are not immune from the New World Order and this attack, and you better take it serious.
[00:49:17.081 --> 00:49:35.667]  Now, the Bilderberg Group, the Club of Rome, the UN, the Rand Corporation, the Rockefeller Foundation, they've all written countless white papers that we've covered it on air and made films about, in some cases decades ago, about how they're going to roll this out.
[00:49:38.359 --> 00:49:40.920]  And how they're going to carry this out against us.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:47.223]  So that's how I was able to predict we'd get to this point is because they're following a plan.
[00:49:47.223 --> 00:49:53.965]  And they treat us like we're dumb animals, but they're noticing we're not dumb animals.
[00:49:53.965 --> 00:50:01.989]  And so they are very specific how they would use a virus to bring in a world ID under a vaccine passport.
[00:50:01.989 --> 00:50:04.950]  That would be the foundation or the platform or the skeleton
[00:50:06.696 --> 00:50:20.186]  Of the global social credit score that tracks and controls everything you do, the global carbon tax, and once they bankrupt everybody, the universal basic income to fully control you and make sure you're not self-sufficient.
[00:50:20.186 --> 00:50:31.875]  And so I don't have one clip, I don't have five clips, I have dozens of clips the last 48 hours of world leaders saying, we're rolling out a global carbon tax based on the
[00:50:34.451 --> 00:50:36.792]  Vaccine passport and a social credit score.
[00:50:36.792 --> 00:50:38.212]  It's all the same thing.
[00:50:38.212 --> 00:50:44.555]  And it is hell on earth that they are deploying.
[00:50:44.555 --> 00:50:45.975]  So I want to go through some of these clips.
[00:50:45.975 --> 00:50:51.998]  But remember, while they're announcing these at their quote, global government summit, look on screen.
[00:50:51.998 --> 00:50:57.160]  The ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center that run the big tech companies response are saying it doesn't exist.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:57.580]  Look out.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.681]  If you share this, you can get in trouble.
[00:51:00.681 --> 00:51:03.302]  There is no emerging totalitarian world government.
[00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:17.669]  So they're announcing world government, they're announcing you'll have to have this ID or this face scan to buy or sell, and you'll have to behave the way they want you to or you won't have the right to even leave your house, but that's not authoritarian.
[00:51:17.669 --> 00:51:18.429]  No, you're right.
[00:51:18.429 --> 00:51:22.870]  That's totalitarian.
[00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:24.870]  Which means maximum control.
[00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:28.451]  Even worse than authoritarian.
[00:51:28.451 --> 00:51:29.492]  So here's some of the headlines.
[00:51:29.492 --> 00:51:34.893]  The Bank of England has officially announced you will have a digital ID to buy and sell on new digital currencies.
[00:51:36.687 --> 00:51:53.360]  Now I'm going to play a clip of the head of the IMF in a moment, saying, oh, the central banks will lose power if they don't bring out the digital central bank currencies.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:52:03.528]  And here is, in Indonesia, the individual that runs the government banking system and the health minister, both on stage, talking about it.
[00:52:03.528 --> 00:52:03.849]  Here it is.
[00:52:05.441 --> 00:52:12.044]  So let's have a digital health certificate acknowledged by WHO.
[00:52:12.044 --> 00:52:17.827]  If you have been vaccinated or tested properly, then you can move around.
[00:52:17.827 --> 00:52:29.873]  So for the next pandemic, instead of stopping the movement of the people 100%, which clogged the economy globally, you know, you can still provide some movement of the people.
[00:52:29.873 --> 00:52:31.074]  Indonesia has achieved
[00:52:32.114 --> 00:52:46.603]  G20 country has agreed to have this digital certificate using WHO standard and we will submit into the next World Health Assembly in Geneva as the revision to international health regulation.
[00:52:46.603 --> 00:52:54.748]  So hopefully for the next pandemic, we can still see some movement of the people, some movement of the goods and movement of the economy.
[00:52:55.734 --> 00:53:03.196]  So this has already been announced and prepared and is ready and is all set up, but now they're telling the general public, the slaves, what's happening.
[00:53:03.196 --> 00:53:11.399]  Here is European Central Bank head Christine Legrand explaining that this is all about power and control.
[00:53:11.399 --> 00:53:11.699]  Here it is.
[00:53:13.086 --> 00:53:14.226]  Where do we stand?
[00:53:14.226 --> 00:53:15.167]  We central bankers.
[00:53:15.167 --> 00:53:21.648]  We have been operating as a monetary anchor in relation to the commercial banks and the private money.
[00:53:21.648 --> 00:53:32.652]  If we are not in that game, if we are not involved in experimenting, in innovating in terms of digital central bank money, we risk losing the role of
[00:53:34.554 --> 00:53:34.894]  Thank you.
[00:53:45.518 --> 00:53:49.801]  Was not there, and that precipitated crisis after crisis.
[00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:53.983]  That certainly was the case at the time of the free banking in the 19th century.
[00:53:53.983 --> 00:53:55.964]  Do we want to go back to those days?
[00:53:55.964 --> 00:53:56.685]  Probably not.
[00:53:56.685 --> 00:54:08.832]  I would say certainly not from our vantage point, as a result of which we have to respond to the demand for those digital payments in order to maintain the role of anchor that we have been playing regularly.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:16.464]  That's Christine Lagarde, head of the European Union Central Bank, former head of the IMF, all the same group.
[00:54:16.464 --> 00:54:17.825]  They're the ones instituting the crisis.
[00:54:17.825 --> 00:54:19.406]  They're the ones that ran the FTX.
[00:54:19.406 --> 00:54:21.027]  They're the ones creating the crises.
[00:54:21.027 --> 00:54:24.309]  But she says, give us more power and we'll stop future crises.
[00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:25.950]  That's called being held hostage.
[00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.211]  Now, here's Catherine Austen Fitts.
[00:54:28.211 --> 00:54:28.872]  She used to run.
[00:54:31.223 --> 00:54:38.305]  The HUD Department for the Clintons, and as a major whistleblower, explaining what a European Central Bank or U.S.
[00:54:38.305 --> 00:54:40.606]  Central Bank digital currency is.
[00:54:40.606 --> 00:54:42.927]  What is a CBDC?
[00:54:42.927 --> 00:54:43.427]  Here she is.
[00:54:43.427 --> 00:54:48.448]  These central bank digital currencies, how do they work?
[00:54:48.448 --> 00:54:54.470]  So, it's a digital currency and an all-digital system that can be controlled centrally.
[00:54:55.692 --> 00:55:05.081]  So for example, we saw during COVID-19, there were rules saying you couldn't travel more than a certain amount of miles from your house, right?
[00:55:05.081 --> 00:55:07.623]  So there's certain behaviors you couldn't do.
[00:55:07.623 --> 00:55:19.455]  This is a digital system where the central bankers, in very centralized ways, can make rules about what you can and cannot do with your money, and they can enforce the rules with total surveillance.
[00:55:20.658 --> 00:55:23.520]  So, this is not a currency.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.303]  You know, so it's called Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC, but it's not a currency.
[00:55:28.303 --> 00:55:29.984]  It's a control system.
[00:55:29.984 --> 00:55:39.190]  Final question I have for you, before I attack our next guest here, is the moment that you say something that's true that goes against the narrative, people that go, yeah, well, who's this person?
[00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.190]  You know, what's her background?
[00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:41.171]  What's his background?
[00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:48.416]  Could you maybe share with us just a brief, kind of succinct self-bio so people out there know that you are in fact a credible source?
[00:55:49.452 --> 00:55:55.157]  So I have an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
[00:55:55.157 --> 00:55:57.479]  I was on Wall Street for 11 years.
[00:55:57.479 --> 00:56:01.922]  I was a managing director and partner of the Board of Directors of Dillon Reed & Company.
[00:56:01.922 --> 00:56:06.105]  I then became Assistant Secretary of Housing in the first Bush administration.
[00:56:06.105 --> 00:56:16.434]  I tried to stop the housing bubble and as a result got into 11-year litigation with the Department of Justice, upon which I learned a great deal about enforcement in the courts in America.
[00:56:17.234 --> 00:56:25.617]  And then I started the Solari report, Disgusted with Corporate Media, and I published something, we published many things.
[00:56:25.617 --> 00:56:29.038]  You can find it at solari.com and solariinvestmentadvice.com.
[00:56:29.038 --> 00:56:31.639]  So she's a great lady, but the point is, this has all been announced.
[00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:32.799]  This is all happening.
[00:56:32.799 --> 00:56:34.660]  We just showed you them saying it.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.081]  We'll control when you can move around, where you can go, what you can do.
[00:56:38.081 --> 00:56:39.041]  It isn't coming.
[00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:40.462]  It's here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:42.574 --> 00:56:46.295]  Banking giants and New York Fed start 12-week digital dollar pilot.
[00:56:46.295 --> 00:56:47.656]  Reuters.
[00:56:47.656 --> 00:56:48.856]  Not coming.
[00:56:48.856 --> 00:56:56.498]  It's here where they surveil and control everything you do and decide where you can spend money and where you can't.
[00:56:56.498 --> 00:56:59.759]  They're already debanking millions of patriots and conservatives.
[00:56:59.759 --> 00:57:01.200]  People say, well I better grovel to them.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:01.920]  No.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.720]  They get this in place.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.081]  Hell on earth will ensue.
[00:57:06.755 --> 00:57:15.499]  And the Bible says at some point they will take over, but it's our job to oppose it and fight it now, or God is not going to recognize us at the Great White Throne Judgment.
[00:57:15.499 --> 00:57:18.080]  If you don't fight this now, you're on their team.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:22.823]  If you don't speak out now, if you don't say no to this now, you are on their team.
[00:57:22.823 --> 00:57:24.964]  Better choose a side right now.
[00:57:26.124 --> 00:57:27.666]  I'm not scared of the New World Order.
[00:57:27.666 --> 00:57:29.047]  I'm not scared of nuclear war.
[00:57:29.047 --> 00:57:31.389]  I'm not scared of their bio-weapons or death.
[00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:35.473]  I am scared of one thing, and that's not being on Team God.
[00:57:35.473 --> 00:57:37.455]  There's Team Freedom and there's Team Demon.
[00:57:37.455 --> 00:57:38.957]  Folks, God's watching.
[00:57:38.957 --> 00:57:44.542]  You better get that lightening up your spine and get connected to the Holy Ghost now.
[00:57:44.542 --> 00:57:46.204]  Alright, second hour straight ahead.
[00:57:52.912 --> 00:57:57.257]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:57:57.257 --> 00:58:08.468]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:58:09.389 --> 00:58:21.153]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[00:58:21.153 --> 00:58:28.356]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.
[00:58:28.356 --> 00:58:30.237]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[00:58:30.237 --> 00:58:31.157]  Black Friday comes early.
[00:58:31.497 --> 00:58:36.602]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:06.687]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[00:59:06.687 --> 00:59:19.437]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[00:59:20.097 --> 00:59:31.625]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:39.810]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:47.996]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[00:59:52.307 --> 00:59:56.472]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.472 --> 00:59:58.434]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:17.518]  The third difference which we see in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the fact that the winners take it all.
[01:00:17.518 --> 01:00:24.842]  Contrary to the previous industrial revolutions, it's very difficult to copy.
[01:00:24.842 --> 01:00:26.343]  So if you are a first mover,
[01:00:28.649 --> 01:00:30.471]  You are the winners.
[01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:38.639]  And this will determine global competition on a national, but also on a business level to a large extent.
[01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:45.266]  And I hope in a not too hostile way in the coming years.
[01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.128]  It really is true in a social Darwinistic
[01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:48.790]  I don't know.
[01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:05.134]  That really they've all been given ample warning and deserve what they get.
[01:01:05.134 --> 01:01:11.797]  And that's why the globalists target adults with deadly shots and assisted suicide and all the rest of it.
[01:01:11.797 --> 01:01:21.881]  Because metaphysically in the natural law of the universe, if you can get somebody to hurt themselves out of their free will, even if you pretty much trick them, you still got to give them a hint.
[01:01:24.286 --> 01:01:27.929]  It doesn't come back on you metaphysically as bad.
[01:01:27.929 --> 01:01:50.965]  And what will happen to politics in your country in 20 years when somebody in San Francisco or in Beijing knows the entire medical and personal history of every politician, every judge, and every journalist in your country, including all those sexual escapades,
[01:01:52.006 --> 01:01:56.968]  All their mental weaknesses and all their corrupt dealings.
[01:01:56.968 --> 01:02:00.689]  Will it still be an independent country?
[01:02:00.689 --> 01:02:03.671]  Or will it become a data colony?
[01:02:03.671 --> 01:02:09.753]  When you have enough data, you don't need to send soldiers in order to control a country.
[01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:15.482]  So they're definitely involved in a spiritual alchemy, and they understand the laws of the universe.
[01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:23.372]  But when they cross the Rubicon, trying to euthanize children, trying to sterilize children, trying to wreck the brains of children...
[01:02:29.122 --> 01:02:33.524]  That God will not put up with and will destroy us.
[01:02:33.524 --> 01:02:40.066]  Originally it was pericarditis and I was then told just before Christmas actually it's perimyocarditis.
[01:02:40.066 --> 01:02:45.088]  So it's actually worse because I've got pericarditis and myocarditis damage.
[01:02:45.088 --> 01:02:49.570]  So I have scarring on three parts of my heart and still the lining of muscle of my heart.
[01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:51.931]  I've got the inflammation which constricts it.
[01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:53.672]  So that's when my heart rate goes up.
[01:02:53.672 --> 01:02:56.353]  That's what's constricting my heart and stopping me from breathing.
[01:02:56.893 --> 01:03:00.654]  And the other team we're fighting knows that.
[01:03:00.654 --> 01:03:16.499]  And that's why they try to get us to go along and sanction the killing of children, whether it be abortion or assisted suicide or transgenderism as a form of genetic suicide for the people that actually get sterilized.
[01:03:16.499 --> 01:03:20.501]  And so they're trying to get us to lower our shields.
[01:03:21.656 --> 01:03:22.997]  Ourselves.
[01:03:22.997 --> 01:03:26.158]  The depopulationists dream.
[01:03:26.158 --> 01:03:30.100]  A 3D printed suicide machine.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.302]  Or in other words, a modern day gas chamber.
[01:03:33.302 --> 01:03:39.544]  The Sarko capsule, a high tech death machine explicitly built for killing yourself, was just 3D printed.
[01:03:39.544 --> 01:03:46.688]  The Sarko capsule is being touted by depopulationists as a way to efficiently and effortlessly kill oneself.
[01:03:47.668 --> 01:03:52.210]  Amir Farsood has applied for medically assisted dying, known as MAID.
[01:03:52.210 --> 01:04:02.734]  He lives in constant agony due to a back injury, but has started the process for end of life because his rooming house is up for sale and he can't find anywhere else to live that he can afford.
[01:04:02.734 --> 01:04:08.396]  Once inside the pod, the user will have to start the fatal process themselves.
[01:04:08.396 --> 01:04:11.758]  They will have to press a button which will reduce internal oxygen levels.
[01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:18.563]  The pod, which is biodegradable, can then be detached to be used as a coffin.
[01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:31.134]  When a Canadian veteran picked up the phone and called Veterans Affairs Canada to get treatment for his combat-related PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, he expected help getting better and getting his life back.
[01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:37.259]  Instead, he got an unexpected and unwanted offer to help him end it through medically assisted death.
[01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:39.731]  This is all being done by design.
[01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:43.154]  Well, the globalists say they're destroying the country by design.
[01:04:43.154 --> 01:04:46.156]  This is a pro-death, pro-tyranny cult.
[01:04:59.488 --> 01:05:07.714]  It's November 2022, and that means our historic biggest sale of the year is now live at nfowarstore.com.
[01:05:07.714 --> 01:05:16.721]  Up to 60% off on our best-selling products when you use promo code 1776 or 1776 at checkout.

[01:05:35.852 --> 01:05:37.593]  This is the Linus Pauling formula.
[01:05:37.593 --> 01:05:40.775]  You want it, InfoWarStore.com, and the list goes on and on.
[01:05:41.075 --> 01:05:52.840]  DNA Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, Super Mel Vitality, Physic Magnesium, all of it from 40 to 60% off when you use promo code 1776 at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.241]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:58.243]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[01:06:04.981 --> 01:06:07.463]  Coming at you live!
[01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.383]  Woo!
[01:06:08.383 --> 01:06:10.685]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:06:10.685 --> 01:06:13.166]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:14.687]  It's Alex Jones. 50,000!
[01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:59.279]  What if I told you they were lying?
[01:06:59.279 --> 01:07:01.541]  What would they do?
[01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:02.862]  They'd come after me.
[01:07:02.862 --> 01:07:06.366]  Because they're coming after you.
[01:07:06.366 --> 01:07:10.790]  Our friends from Langley are back again.
[01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:17.336]  50,000!
[01:07:17.336 --> 01:07:21.100]  But if we know what's going on, we are unstoppable.
[01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:26.262]  All right, Matt Baker's a great guy.
[01:07:26.262 --> 01:07:28.143]  I've met him, hung out with him several times.
[01:07:28.143 --> 01:07:34.044]  He's been here to the studios and he's got some of the very best viral rants at city council meetings.
[01:07:34.044 --> 01:07:35.065]  He was just in Maricopa County.
[01:07:35.065 --> 01:07:40.526]  We're going to be talking to him coming up here in just a moment.
[01:07:40.526 --> 01:07:47.107]  He'll be riding shotgun with us as we cover news throughout the hour.
[01:07:47.107 --> 01:07:49.088]  But let me just get this out right now.
[01:07:50.438 --> 01:07:57.664]  We are in a toe-to-toe war with the globalists, with the New World Order, right now.
[01:07:57.664 --> 01:08:01.207]  And we can't take these people on without your support.
[01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:09.674]  I'm trying to find today's live show plug because I wrote some notes on it a little bit earlier, and of course, because I did that, I can't find it.
[01:08:09.674 --> 01:08:11.956]  Here it is.
[01:08:11.956 --> 01:08:12.837]  Because this is important.
[01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:16.257]  We are not funded by the New World Order.
[01:08:16.257 --> 01:08:18.037]  We are not funded by the globalists.
[01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:20.919]  We are funded by, we the people, that means you.
[01:08:20.919 --> 01:08:34.023]  And if we're going to stop World War III, that'll turn our whole country and our world into this image of a nuked DC, then we've got to mobilize and support and magnify the voices of truth out there.
[01:08:34.023 --> 01:08:38.505]  So, I announced Monday
[01:08:40.259 --> 01:08:46.042]  That we're going to extend the big sale that's going, the big mega sale, blowout sales, sellout sale.
[01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:50.465]  We're going to extend that until all the products sell out.
[01:08:52.739 --> 01:09:05.284]  Because we've got to get the funds in now to pay our legal and to stay on air and to do our appeals and not let them take us off air so we don't just roll over and die so they can have their big fake victory.
[01:09:05.284 --> 01:09:10.347]  Info Wars is in your hands as viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[01:09:10.347 --> 01:09:17.890]  If you financially support us and get great products that empower yourself and your life, if you make that decision, then we're unstoppable.
[01:09:18.871 --> 01:09:20.932]  But here's the good news.
[01:09:20.932 --> 01:09:28.756]  Everything is on sale 50-60% off with promo code 1776 at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:09:28.756 --> 01:09:30.837]  Here's the problem.
[01:09:30.837 --> 01:09:34.319]  We've already sold out of our super high quality coffee.
[01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:35.280]  We just sold out of X3.
[01:09:36.684 --> 01:09:39.128]  We're about to sell out of Brain Force Plus.
[01:09:39.128 --> 01:09:43.274]  We have got most of these products about to sell out.
[01:09:43.274 --> 01:09:47.500]  Now I can sit there and keep them a few months at full price and bring in money, but we need the funds now.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.862]  Plus, I want you to get these products.
[01:09:48.862 --> 01:09:52.327]  So a lot of these won't come in for months and months and months, but we got to have the funds now.
[01:09:52.928 --> 01:09:54.269]  Some of these products we're making 10-15% on.
[01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:57.150]  Some we're making 30% on.
[01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:59.771]  Most products are marked up four or five times.
[01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:00.351]  Ours aren't like that.
[01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:03.153]  When they're at full price, they're marked up 100 and something percent.

[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.041]  Vitamin D3 Gummies with
[01:10:36.963 --> 01:10:37.744]  We're good to go.
[01:10:58.024 --> 01:11:00.145]  All right, let's shift gears now to the power of the people.
[01:11:28.527 --> 01:11:46.840]  Whether it's a school board, or whether it's a city council, or whether it's a state legislature, or whether it's a demonstration in Washington, the most effective place for the average person to get past the censors and to reach tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, or tens of millions of people, as Matt Baker's done, is to go to these events.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.242]  That's why in the last year and a half, the FBI went to the school boards and said,
[01:11:52.372 --> 01:11:58.356]  In a secret document, we want to come intimidate people not to come to these events because it's hurting us too politically.
[01:11:58.356 --> 01:12:11.886]  If conservatives or populists or nationalists ever figure it out and actually go take back peacefully their counties, their cities, their states, their school boards, their zoning boards are key.
[01:12:11.886 --> 01:12:13.648]  That's where it's in the 2030s coming through.
[01:12:15.288 --> 01:12:26.716]  If that happens, and if people realize how easy it is to take over your local governments because what we're promoting is common sense and popular and based on common sense, it's game over!
[01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:36.432]  And so if you go to your city council, and maybe a thousand people are there, and maybe ten thousand see it on a local TV station, that's a big win.
[01:12:36.432 --> 01:12:40.174]  But most people that go give a good speech reach a hundred thousand.
[01:12:40.174 --> 01:12:47.359]  And a lot of people, every day, I can't even keep track of it, I'll see dozens of videos, I've been looking, of a half million here, two million there, a million here, three hundred thousand there.
[01:12:47.879 --> 01:13:01.745]  With people just going black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, gay, straight, saying I don't want forced masks, I don't want forced injections, I don't want open borders, I don't want devalued dollars, I don't want fentanyl, I don't want the new world order, I don't want Klaus Schwab, I don't want election fraud.
[01:13:04.022 --> 01:13:08.286]  When you simply do that, everybody else already feels like you.
[01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:10.788]  They get mobilized, they get inspired.
[01:13:10.788 --> 01:13:22.559]  And the weakest link in the New World Order's defense, the missing patch of scales on smog's belly, where we can get the truth, the sword into his heart, is local governments.
[01:13:22.559 --> 01:13:26.282]  What the globalists teach their people, think global, act local.
[01:13:26.282 --> 01:13:29.205]  Well, we should think local, think individual.
[01:13:30.094 --> 01:13:34.018]  And think humanity and we should take over the local now.
[01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:37.061]  That's their cheek in the armor.
[01:13:37.061 --> 01:13:40.484]  And so we've got some of the greatest hits of Matt Baker coming up.
[01:13:40.484 --> 01:13:47.430]  But as we go to break, I want to go ahead and play a clip of him in front of the Maricopa board.
[01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:48.591]  They're talking about election fraud.
[01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:48.892]  Here it is.
[01:13:51.087 --> 01:13:52.428]  Good morning.
[01:13:52.428 --> 01:14:01.634]  Once again, the eyes of the world are upon Maricopa County for another botched election.
[01:14:01.634 --> 01:14:06.238]  Am I here to accuse you of stealing the vote?
[01:14:06.238 --> 01:14:09.020]  Heavens no, for that would make me a terrorist, wouldn't it?
[01:14:10.595 --> 01:14:29.786]  Let me ask you, if you took your life savings to a bank, and the teller put them in a machine, and the machine kicked out one out of four of your bills, and the teller said, don't worry, we'll put them in box three over here, and we'll let you know how many were in there later.
[01:14:29.786 --> 01:14:35.629]  We'll send them off to a separate location, and someone will be sure to get back to you and tell you how much money you have.
[01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:36.790]  Would you be okay with that?
[01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:41.637]  No, you would not be okay with that.
[01:14:41.637 --> 01:14:43.818]  Now ask yourself the question.
[01:14:43.818 --> 01:14:46.040]  Which is more valuable?
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.902]  Your vote or your money?
[01:14:48.902 --> 01:14:52.365]  Now ask a lobbyist that same question.
[01:14:52.365 --> 01:14:55.087]  Now ask a campaign manager that question.
[01:14:55.087 --> 01:14:59.370]  Now ask Mark Zuckerberg that question.
[01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.191]  Which is more valuable?
[01:15:01.191 --> 01:15:02.632]  Your money or your vote?
[01:15:03.673 --> 01:15:05.134]  Or your country?
[01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:06.356]  Or this world?
[01:15:06.356 --> 01:15:13.402]  Or the corruption that is taking over every single county in this nation?
[01:15:13.402 --> 01:15:26.133]  And then you look into your own soul and you look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you are the cancer that is tearing this nation apart!
[01:15:26.133 --> 01:15:26.993]  Good day!
[01:15:28.146 --> 01:15:29.167]  Thank you.
[01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:33.430]  Our next speaker... And that is the truth, and that is the spirit of liberty.
[01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:39.455]  Matt Baker, underscored, unhinged on Instagram, at VanDot Video, slave to liberty.
[01:15:39.455 --> 01:15:43.519]  Matt Baker and some of his greatest hits, when we come back on the other side.
[01:15:43.519 --> 01:15:45.220]  Again, Matt Baker's our guest.
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:47.202]  We should all be Matt Baker.
[01:15:47.202 --> 01:15:49.324]  They call him the Alex Jones of dreadlocks.
[01:15:49.324 --> 01:15:50.885]  He does look like my brother or something.
[01:15:50.885 --> 01:15:53.647]  If I grew dreadlocks out, if I could, I'd look like Matt Baker.
[01:15:53.647 --> 01:15:54.328]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:00.194 --> 01:16:00.894]  We're good to go.

[01:16:30.029 --> 01:16:31.550]  The Vitamin C Zinc.

[01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:34.252]  Vitamin C.

[01:16:54.913 --> 01:16:57.917]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[01:16:58.962 --> 01:17:10.450]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:14.913]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:17:14.913 --> 01:17:18.876]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:17:18.876 --> 01:17:22.518]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:23.599]  You see, the sun
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:25.400]  We're good to
[01:17:49.005 --> 01:17:52.771]  At InfoWarsTore.com with promo code 1776.
[01:17:52.771 --> 01:17:53.472]  Don't wait!
[01:17:53.472 --> 01:17:57.758]  Support the InfoWar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:07.405]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:18:07.405 --> 01:18:17.050]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we, we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[01:18:17.050 --> 01:18:18.711]  And that's the problem.
[01:18:18.711 --> 01:18:21.472]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:18:21.472 --> 01:18:24.254]  They illegally changed state elections.
[01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:30.676]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:18:30.676 --> 01:18:32.697]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:18:32.697 --> 01:18:36.958]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:52.063]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[01:18:53.244 --> 01:18:54.925]  Shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:18:54.925 --> 01:18:56.306]  We're not election deniers.
[01:18:56.306 --> 01:18:59.128]  We're election realists.
[01:18:59.128 --> 01:19:05.192]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:19:05.192 --> 01:19:08.295]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:14.299]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:19:14.299 --> 01:19:17.840]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.680]  It's game over.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:24.382]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:19:24.382 --> 01:19:28.984]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:19:28.984 --> 01:19:35.126]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:47.589]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsTore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:19:47.589 --> 01:19:53.710]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:55.511]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[01:19:59.918 --> 01:20:04.540]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:09.083]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:13.705]  So here's Matt Baker.
[01:20:25.658 --> 01:20:30.261]  Well over a year and a half ago, confronting the vaccine tyrants.
[01:20:30.261 --> 01:20:33.163]  Remember back then it seemed like the lockdown would never end and they were invincible.
[01:20:33.163 --> 01:20:34.364]  Now they're asking for amnesty.
[01:20:34.364 --> 01:20:38.607]  But we're not giving them amnesty until they all face Nuremberg Trial 2.0.
[01:20:38.607 --> 01:20:39.007]  Here it is.
[01:20:39.007 --> 01:20:39.788]  We'll go to Matt himself.
[01:20:45.996 --> 01:20:46.917]  That's the wind.
[01:20:46.917 --> 01:20:48.719]  That's the wind of time.
[01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.061]  That's the wind of history.
[01:20:51.061 --> 01:20:58.188]  That's the wind blowing through your ancestors' bones, begging you to do the right thing.
[01:20:58.188 --> 01:21:00.450]  Sir, can you please state your name for the audio record?
[01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:05.095]  That is the wind that Matt Baker is calling upon from Ocean Beach.
[01:21:11.286 --> 01:21:25.092]  The wind that is blowing through the black people, through the white people, through the Chinese people, through the Mexican-Americans, through the people that built this building with their bare hands to raise up this nation!
[01:21:25.092 --> 01:21:32.675]  They are begging you and they are blowing through your veins and they should be putting a tingle up the spine of your back!
[01:21:33.135 --> 01:21:35.938]  And they should be begging you to do the right thing!
[01:21:35.938 --> 01:21:38.481]  You're about to open a pit of hell!
[01:21:38.481 --> 01:21:42.706]  You do not get a vaccine passport put on us!
[01:21:42.706 --> 01:21:48.012]  You know as the population who's in control, you know that the people
[01:21:48.012 --> 01:21:53.094]  For the politicians, once you get a power, you will never relinquish it.
[01:21:53.094 --> 01:22:05.699]  Do you think that the four feet of marble that holds you above, high in this chamber, will help you from the fate of humanity which you are unleashing?
[01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:08.360]  NO!
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.801]  IT WON'T!
[01:22:09.801 --> 01:22:14.264]  YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WILL BE SUBJECTED!
[01:22:14.264 --> 01:22:18.987]  THEY WILL BE ASKED, HOW MANY VACCINES HAVE YOU HAD?
[01:22:18.987 --> 01:22:21.569]  HAVE YOU BEEN A GOOD LITTLE NAZI?
[01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:23.750]  HEIL FAUCI!
[01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:24.671]  HEIL FAUCI!
[01:22:24.671 --> 01:22:26.592]  HEIL FAUCI!
[01:22:26.592 --> 01:22:28.654]  HEIL FAUCI!
[01:22:29.834 --> 01:22:35.655]  There has been a lot of talk about the Nuremberg Code!
[01:22:35.655 --> 01:22:38.356]  Well, I brought you a copy!
[01:22:38.356 --> 01:22:42.936]  You are all in violation of Section 1!
[01:22:42.936 --> 01:22:44.217]  Yes, you, Dr. Wilton!
[01:22:44.217 --> 01:22:49.257]  You are in violation of the Nuremberg Code!
[01:22:49.257 --> 01:22:51.538]  Which is international law!
[01:22:51.538 --> 01:22:54.838]  And the definition is... Sir, your time has expired.
[01:22:54.838 --> 01:22:58.159]  The definition shall not be... Sir, your time has expired.
[01:22:58.319 --> 01:23:01.100]  First, all of this is coercion!
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.621]  The vaccine passport is coercion!
[01:23:03.621 --> 01:23:07.142]  And the penalty for violating the Nuremberg Code is... Death!
[01:23:07.142 --> 01:23:08.043]  Please take a seat.
[01:23:08.043 --> 01:23:08.703]  Please take a seat.
[01:23:18.803 --> 01:23:21.425]  Matt Baker joins us for the rest of the hour.
[01:23:21.425 --> 01:23:23.426]  Matt, I tell you, what a time to be alive.
[01:23:23.426 --> 01:23:25.708]  Absolute Nuremberg violation.
[01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:29.910]  The ADL is giving an award to Pfizer for their Joseph Mingala activity.
[01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:33.473]  They just created the official Joseph Mingala Appreciation Award.
[01:23:33.473 --> 01:23:34.554]  I mean, it's not even a joke.
[01:23:34.554 --> 01:23:35.955]  These people are sick.
[01:23:35.955 --> 01:23:39.497]  Matt Baker, your view on the Stone Election, the whole world, with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:40.117]  God bless you, brother.
[01:23:40.117 --> 01:23:40.918]  You're a real inspiration.
[01:23:45.962 --> 01:23:46.622]  Are we up?
[01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:47.363]  Yes, sir, you're up.
[01:23:47.363 --> 01:23:49.864]  So just what do you want to tackle first?
[01:23:49.864 --> 01:23:52.266]  I felt like I was going out to a break there.
[01:23:52.266 --> 01:23:53.847]  No, no, I'm bad about that.
[01:23:53.847 --> 01:23:55.608]  I'm bad about that.
[01:23:55.608 --> 01:23:58.710]  The winds of change are with us, brother.
[01:23:58.710 --> 01:23:59.770]  Well, they are.
[01:23:59.770 --> 01:24:05.334]  You know, I went to this other school board, no, city council meeting, that is.
[01:24:05.334 --> 01:24:07.075]  The Board of Supervisors, that is.
[01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:12.198]  I want to know, who is it that creates the talking points for the Board of Supervisors?
[01:24:13.678 --> 01:24:21.803]  The Board of Supervisors out here in Arizona is almost an exact clone replica of the Board of Supervisors that is in San Diego.
[01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:23.944]  They have the same exact talking points.
[01:24:23.944 --> 01:24:26.005]  They have the same exact agendas.
[01:24:26.005 --> 01:24:27.747]  They're all New World Order agendas.
[01:24:27.747 --> 01:24:29.628]  Oh, it's all Agenda 2030, Agenda 21.
[01:24:29.628 --> 01:24:30.828]  It's all implemented by Davos.
[01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:36.653]  Yeah, I want to know who it is that's giving these guys their talking points.
[01:24:36.653 --> 01:24:45.021]  You need to go to your local board of supervisors and find out what they're up to, because I can guarantee you it's not good.
[01:24:45.021 --> 01:24:48.564]  These people pass every single thing that's on their agenda.
[01:24:48.564 --> 01:24:53.449]  They'll have a supposedly right-leaning person and a supposedly left-leaning person.
[01:24:53.929 --> 01:25:01.798]  And they'll put things on the agenda and literally every single thing they put on the agenda, they go, okay, anybody against?
[01:25:01.798 --> 01:25:02.258]  No?
[01:25:02.258 --> 01:25:02.699]  Okay.
[01:25:02.699 --> 01:25:06.863]  And the agenda passes literally to a T every single time.
[01:25:06.863 --> 01:25:11.709]  It just goes, just a train of tyranny that just rolls right through all of our towns.
[01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:14.672]  And we don't even know, we don't even realize what's going on with it.
[01:25:15.172 --> 01:25:22.896]  You know, I think we should get some biodegradable bullets, you know, because that would be really helpful in this situation.
[01:25:22.896 --> 01:25:25.057]  You know, I'm just kidding.
[01:25:25.057 --> 01:25:28.419]  Well, expanding on that, what you get is a central issue.
[01:25:28.419 --> 01:25:33.102]  Whether we're in Australia or the US or Canada or Europe, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:33.102 --> 01:25:36.864]  It's the same New World Order agenda, the same talking points, the same program.
[01:25:38.519 --> 01:25:39.180]  It is, man.
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.200]  And you gotta get out there.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.181]  You gotta be part of it.
[01:25:41.181 --> 01:25:44.164]  You can't listen to people who say, there's nothing we can do.
[01:25:44.164 --> 01:25:50.389]  You know, look at the ripple effect that just a person like I cause, or Alex Stein.
[01:25:50.389 --> 01:25:52.390]  You know, I gotta give props to Alex Stein.
[01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:53.511]  He's so hardworking.
[01:25:53.511 --> 01:25:57.595]  He kind of inspired me to continue on and to find
[01:25:58.255 --> 01:25:58.955]  Thank you so much.
[01:26:15.672 --> 01:26:16.013]  And that's
[01:26:34.054 --> 01:26:46.247]  It's like Klaus Schwab is penetrating your cabinet, and what you need to do is put a little friction and don't lubricate it for good old Klaus Schwab and the New World Order.
[01:26:46.247 --> 01:26:52.314]  We need to stop these people at every point, at every place, everywhere, every time.
[01:26:52.994 --> 01:26:54.295]  And all the time.
[01:26:54.295 --> 01:26:55.836]  And that's what we have to do.
[01:26:55.836 --> 01:27:02.461]  And if I and Alex Stein can make these giant ripples, just imagine if there was thousands of us or millions of us.
[01:27:02.461 --> 01:27:11.107]  If every single person on planet Earth would just simply gain that warrior spirit and just everyone just said, nope, we're not doing that.
[01:27:11.107 --> 01:27:13.368]  All in unison, all at the same time.
[01:27:13.368 --> 01:27:15.670]  We wouldn't even be having this conversation.
[01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:20.073]  We'd be down at the river, having a beer and looking at the fish jump.
[01:27:20.473 --> 01:27:28.116]  But no, we're not because everybody wants to be a slave and they want to give in and they want to relax and they want to say there's nothing we can do.
[01:27:28.116 --> 01:27:29.076]  Trust the plan.
[01:27:29.076 --> 01:27:30.377]  Well, don't trust the plan.
[01:27:30.377 --> 01:27:31.717]  You are the plan.
[01:27:31.717 --> 01:27:32.918]  You are the plan.
[01:27:32.918 --> 01:27:34.238]  You are the motion.
[01:27:34.238 --> 01:27:35.999]  You need to move.
[01:27:35.999 --> 01:27:37.340]  Get off your ass.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:40.921]  Go out there and engage the system.
[01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:47.374]  Everything they do is about getting the individual to not engage to believe your back is broken.
[01:27:47.374 --> 01:27:49.816]  We've gotten Pentagon documents that's hijacked by the globalists.
[01:27:49.816 --> 01:27:54.000]  It's all about breaking the individual's will and making you think you don't have power.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.241]  But because we do have the power.
[01:27:56.798 --> 01:27:58.059]  We absolutely do.
[01:27:58.059 --> 01:27:59.119]  We have the power!
[01:27:59.119 --> 01:28:00.600]  Humanity has the power!
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:04.643]  And if anyone has put that out there, it is you, the great Alex Jones.
[01:28:04.643 --> 01:28:06.644]  I love you, man.
[01:28:06.644 --> 01:28:09.166]  When I saw you in studio, I gave you that big hug.
[01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:12.948]  And afterwards, I was like, man, I should have shook his hand because he's a Texan.
[01:28:12.948 --> 01:28:13.868]  But you know what?
[01:28:13.868 --> 01:28:14.589]  I just love you so much.
[01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:15.609]  Hey, I was happy to get the hug.
[01:28:15.609 --> 01:28:16.690]  I was running from meeting to meeting.
[01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:17.951]  Wish we could have gone and hung out, man.
[01:28:18.579 --> 01:28:23.921]  I just work like... You know, everyone's like, man, he's just under the gun.
[01:28:23.921 --> 01:28:24.902]  People don't realize.
[01:28:24.902 --> 01:28:27.943]  I mean, Alex is really in it to win it.
[01:28:27.943 --> 01:28:30.604]  He is on the ship.
[01:28:30.604 --> 01:28:32.125]  He is that Moby Dick.
[01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:34.866]  He is the Jonah going out for that whale.
[01:28:34.866 --> 01:28:37.347]  He is not going down without a fight.
[01:28:37.347 --> 01:28:42.229]  He's going to stay on board and man this ship, hopefully to a brighter horizon.
[01:28:42.389 --> 01:28:42.850]  Absolutely.
[01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:43.371]  Stay right there.
[01:28:43.371 --> 01:28:49.321]  Let's talk about the election fraud, Ukraine, the war, the world government, all of it with Matt Baker, Trade Head.
[01:28:49.321 --> 01:28:51.684]  Listen, I don't worry about me because I know we're all under attack.
[01:28:51.684 --> 01:28:53.548]  I mean, we're all in deep trouble.
[01:28:59.073 --> 01:29:01.534]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:29:01.534 --> 01:29:02.834]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:29:02.834 --> 01:29:06.295]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:29:06.295 --> 01:29:07.576]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:10.116]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:29:10.116 --> 01:29:15.978]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[01:29:16.138 --> 01:29:17.960]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.862]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[01:29:19.862 --> 01:29:21.783]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[01:29:21.783 --> 01:29:32.373]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[01:29:32.373 --> 01:29:36.117]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[01:29:36.517 --> 01:29:39.399]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[01:29:39.399 --> 01:29:41.841]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[01:29:41.841 --> 01:29:45.523]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:48.865]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[01:29:48.865 --> 01:29:51.087]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[01:29:51.087 --> 01:29:56.350]  This alternative media that we worked so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:58.892]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[01:30:03.154 --> 01:30:07.496]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[01:30:07.496 --> 01:30:19.100]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:25.483]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalists
[01:30:25.703 --> 01:30:26.483]  I think so.
[01:30:59.613 --> 01:31:01.834]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:31:01.834 --> 01:31:05.856]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[01:31:05.856 --> 01:31:07.157]  There's a solution.
[01:31:07.157 --> 01:31:08.157]  The Wellness Company.
[01:31:08.157 --> 01:31:18.662]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer and I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[01:31:18.922 --> 01:31:44.995]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[01:31:45.999 --> 01:31:46.239]  Thank you.
[01:31:59.249 --> 01:32:00.810]  Look around you.
[01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:05.833]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[01:32:05.833 --> 01:32:09.735]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[01:32:09.735 --> 01:32:19.060]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:24.723]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:32:24.723 --> 01:32:28.325]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:32:29.165 --> 01:32:32.270]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:38.580]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:39.861]  It's unsustainable.
[01:32:39.861 --> 01:32:41.083]  So please, visit.
[01:32:42.162 --> 01:32:52.270]  SaveinfoWars.com SaveinfoWars.com where you can make straight donations 5, 10, 50, 100 dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:55.252]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[01:32:55.252 --> 01:32:56.573]  Thank you for your support.
[01:32:56.573 --> 01:32:57.674]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[01:32:57.674 --> 01:33:04.420]  SaveinfoWars.com Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.701]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.852 --> 01:33:21.614]  Matt Baker and the winds of change.
[01:33:21.614 --> 01:33:24.076]  The tyrants know the winds of change are here.
[01:33:24.076 --> 01:33:29.141]  So they're trying to circumvent that with their Great Reset and their New World Order.
[01:33:29.141 --> 01:33:36.767]  I just asked Matt during the break, coming up the next segment, if he had five minutes to address people on national TV or State of the Union, what would he say?
[01:33:36.767 --> 01:33:38.689]  It's going to be two minutes at the City Council.
[01:33:38.689 --> 01:33:39.770]  He's going to think about that.
[01:33:39.770 --> 01:33:43.433]  He's going to give us that analysis or rant or however it comes out next segment.
[01:33:43.433 --> 01:33:43.693]  But Matt,
[01:33:44.614 --> 01:33:49.257]  With the stolen election, with them claiming missile attacks by Russia, they admit are frauds.
[01:33:49.257 --> 01:33:50.118]  All of this.
[01:33:50.118 --> 01:33:51.619]  The system gets more and more desperate.
[01:33:51.619 --> 01:33:55.001]  You've got Sean Penn giving his Oscar to Zelensky as a joke.
[01:33:55.001 --> 01:33:59.705]  You've got Trudeau and the new puppet prime minister of England, like little schoolgirls, calling up Zelensky.
[01:33:59.705 --> 01:34:03.207]  I mean, it's just the whole thing just reeks of failure.
[01:34:03.207 --> 01:34:04.348]  These people really are a joke.
[01:34:06.084 --> 01:34:08.587]  Let me ask you a question, Alex.
[01:34:08.587 --> 01:34:19.603]  Do you think that the war in Ukraine, do you think that Russia is really fighting with Ukraine in the West or do you believe that it is part of the global
[01:34:20.546 --> 01:34:21.707]  We're good to go.
[01:34:37.919 --> 01:34:54.128]  Russia's pipeline because they've shut down our pipeline and basically you can just slit the throat of all of this infrastructure and blame it on the conflict or do you actually believe that Vladimir Putin is in an existential battle for the life of Russia?
[01:34:54.878 --> 01:35:00.643]  Well, there's no doubt that the globalists precipitated this in the last nine years and pushed Russia in this position.
[01:35:00.643 --> 01:35:06.608]  I know Putin's involved with the globalists at many levels, but I think this Slavic civil war has been going on for hundreds of years.
[01:35:06.608 --> 01:35:13.855]  I think it's very, very real at the end of the day, but it's definitely being used as a smokescreen for the Great Reset in the words of the globalists themselves.
[01:35:15.698 --> 01:35:16.258]  Exactly.
[01:35:16.258 --> 01:35:26.962]  Because, you know, back to Klaus Schwab, he says, well, young global leaders like Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Trudeau.
[01:35:26.962 --> 01:35:29.103]  So, I mean, they're said in the same sentence.
[01:35:29.103 --> 01:35:31.224]  And you see what's going on in the world.
[01:35:31.224 --> 01:35:34.545]  And you basically see what the narratives are on the TV.
[01:35:34.545 --> 01:35:36.486]  And they're being, you know, created by
[01:35:37.583 --> 01:35:40.524]  Trudeau and Vladimir Putin.
[01:35:40.524 --> 01:35:46.405]  And Klaus Schwab's just behind the scenes, you know, petting his cat like a supervillain.
[01:35:46.405 --> 01:35:54.147]  It makes you wonder, you know, who's actually, you know, is there any real people on the board?
[01:35:54.147 --> 01:35:56.107]  Or are they all being part of the game?
[01:35:56.107 --> 01:35:57.888]  I mean, I know you've said before,
[01:35:58.428 --> 01:35:58.808]  We're good to go.
[01:36:13.118 --> 01:36:15.039]  Having a threat for a nuclear war?
[01:36:15.039 --> 01:36:17.420]  Or is nuclear war just going to happen whether they want to or not?
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:19.161]  Well, I think that's a very good question to ask.
[01:36:19.161 --> 01:36:21.202]  If you pull back, you've got three predator stakes.
[01:36:21.202 --> 01:36:24.624]  The Anglo-American establishment, the Russians, and the Communist Chinese.
[01:36:24.624 --> 01:36:31.428]  And so they all agree at certain levels for power and control and technocracy, but they're also fighting with each other over the ring of power.
[01:36:31.428 --> 01:36:34.870]  So I think it's both.
[01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:35.370]  Right.
[01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:40.873]  And it kind of brings me to Trump, because I know... Oh yeah, what's your take on Trump announcing the Santa Sola?
[01:36:42.697 --> 01:36:48.098]  Well, you know, obviously, unlike everyone else, I've really liked what DeSantis has been doing.
[01:36:48.098 --> 01:36:52.959]  And, you know, like you say, judging a tree by its fruits.
[01:36:52.959 --> 01:36:55.160]  I like the fruit that's coming off DeSantis.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:05.042]  But, you know, apparently behind the scenes, there's a lot of weird stuff going on with him that, you know, makes you wonder if he's not also a plant or someone there to take the wind out of Trump's sails.
[01:37:05.749 --> 01:37:10.031]  But I just wonder, you know, I really would like to back Trump.
[01:37:10.031 --> 01:37:11.211]  I backed him.
[01:37:11.211 --> 01:37:12.752]  I voted for him twice.
[01:37:12.752 --> 01:37:17.834]  But like you said, I mean, this whole vaccine thing really is kind of a deal breaker.
[01:37:17.834 --> 01:37:19.855]  And it's like, I want to know.
[01:37:19.855 --> 01:37:22.356]  I really want Trump to come out and just say,
[01:37:23.096 --> 01:37:24.176]  I was tricked.
[01:37:24.176 --> 01:37:30.558]  Because when he says it's his idea, he loves it, it's the greatest thing in the world, and he keeps going on with that.
[01:37:30.558 --> 01:37:38.159]  When Q people try to say that the pandemic never would have ended if we didn't have the vaccine, well that's not true.
[01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:48.202]  If you just acted like Florida and said we're not doing a lockdown, we're not doing mask mandates, then it would have ended with the simple just say no campaign like Chris Sky had going on.
[01:37:48.202 --> 01:37:49.822]  And even when they had the vaccine,
[01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:51.263]  That didn't count.
[01:37:51.263 --> 01:37:52.704]  They're like, well, you need two vaccines.
[01:37:52.704 --> 01:37:54.225]  We need two vaccines and a mask.
[01:37:54.225 --> 01:37:55.747]  You need two vaccines and two masks.
[01:37:55.747 --> 01:37:57.248]  You get a booster, you need a mask.
[01:37:57.248 --> 01:38:00.671]  So it's basically whatever they say it is, it is.
[01:38:00.671 --> 01:38:03.893]  And then you're allowed to move, like they say.
[01:38:03.893 --> 01:38:06.095]  You're allowed to move.
[01:38:06.095 --> 01:38:08.837]  Ooh, that makes my blood boil when they say stuff like that.
[01:38:08.837 --> 01:38:09.798]  So let me ask you this.
[01:38:09.798 --> 01:38:11.880]  Gut level, do you think humanity is winning right now?
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.341]  Or is the anti-human force winning?
[01:38:13.341 --> 01:38:15.243]  And what do you see coming in the near future?
[01:38:17.462 --> 01:38:22.025]  Well, I definitely see that we are in the battle of the yin and yang right now.
[01:38:22.025 --> 01:38:28.388]  And obviously, as the evil does rise, you know, the Lord lifts up his hand, as you always say.
[01:38:28.388 --> 01:38:34.171]  I feel like the reign of tyranny is bringing the mushrooms and the mycelia of the liberty
[01:38:35.091 --> 01:38:35.792]  Caps.
[01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:37.513]  We're popping up and we're growing.
[01:38:37.513 --> 01:38:41.797]  Like, I wouldn't exist if it wasn't for all this tyranny coming along, you know?
[01:38:41.797 --> 01:38:43.318]  I was just going about my life.
[01:38:43.318 --> 01:38:47.442]  Like, I didn't want to be, you know, I wasn't in this to be a freedom fighter.
[01:38:47.442 --> 01:38:52.266]  It's just, you look around, you look at the world, and you're just amazed that nobody else wants to stand up.
[01:38:52.266 --> 01:38:59.472]  And it's like, so it's like, if I have to be the one to say the Emperor's not wearing any clothes, and then everyone's like, oh yeah, I was gonna say that.
[01:38:59.472 --> 01:39:00.994]  It's like, well, just fucking say it.
[01:39:00.994 --> 01:39:01.334]  Sorry.
[01:39:03.476 --> 01:39:06.157]  It's the Wizard of Oz, Toto.
[01:39:06.157 --> 01:39:09.139]  We've all got to be Toto and pull back the curtain.
[01:39:09.139 --> 01:39:10.280]  So are we winning?
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:13.782]  I mean, we're alive and you're on the air and I'm on the air.
[01:39:13.782 --> 01:39:16.404]  So I think we can never take anything for granted.
[01:39:16.404 --> 01:39:17.785]  And there's more of us every day.
[01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:24.369]  The more they try to censor, there's all these new amazing people of every race, color and creed popping up to support Liberty.
[01:39:24.369 --> 01:39:24.809]  It's beautiful.
[01:39:26.144 --> 01:39:32.750]  Yeah, I think every breath we take is a victory, because we know where the New World Order wants us.
[01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:36.954]  They want us in these biodegradable death chamber coffins, you know?
[01:39:36.954 --> 01:39:39.936]  You gotta love their little acronyms.
[01:39:39.936 --> 01:39:40.677]  MADE.
[01:39:40.677 --> 01:39:43.580]  Medically assisted suicide death.
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:44.280]  MADE.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:49.305]  And you can be in a biodegradable coffin, and then you can biodegradably help the world.
[01:39:49.305 --> 01:39:52.648]  And it's like, man, I just want to biodegrade them.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:57.664]  Oh, there's too many of us, but they have to stay.
[01:39:57.664 --> 01:39:58.966]  They have to be in charge.
[01:39:58.966 --> 01:39:59.887]  They're the guardians.
[01:39:59.887 --> 01:40:02.350]  They're going to save us by killing us.
[01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:06.195]  Yeah, I've got a great idea for all the global warming people.
[01:40:06.195 --> 01:40:08.078]  You know, it's not a new idea.
[01:40:08.078 --> 01:40:09.580]  I think it's probably been done before.
[01:40:10.601 --> 01:40:14.104]  I say we build a megalith, let's say a pyramid.
[01:40:14.104 --> 01:40:24.733]  We build it down in South America and everybody can kill themselves and they'll get their little name, you know, carved into the pyramid and that will be the pyramid of life.
[01:40:24.733 --> 01:40:27.815]  And they can just all, you know, say they killed themselves for the earth.
[01:40:27.815 --> 01:40:28.776]  You know, it's a great idea.
[01:40:28.776 --> 01:40:34.061]  And they'll be carved in there for all time on their beautiful pyramid of death.
[01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:35.642]  Like I said, it's not a new idea.
[01:40:36.634 --> 01:40:43.439]  Like I say, instead of rambling, yeah, every breath you take is a victory.
[01:40:43.439 --> 01:40:46.201]  Every word you speak is a victory.
[01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:49.024]  Every moment of life is a victory.
[01:40:49.024 --> 01:40:51.105]  And is it the victory we want to see?
[01:40:51.105 --> 01:41:02.914]  Obviously, you know, you and I would love to be living in a lot freer world, but it's that yin and yang, and we're here to be the liberty, and they're here to be the tyranny, and as long as we're here, we're winning.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.082]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:06.082 --> 01:41:10.630]  And we've had so much freedom for so long and allowed this evil to grow because we weren't valuing freedom.
[01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:12.854]  We're now going through the process of valuing freedom again.
[01:41:14.358 --> 01:41:15.639]  Yeah, true man.
[01:41:15.639 --> 01:41:19.843]  It's like the average American has just had it too good, too long.
[01:41:19.843 --> 01:41:26.249]  They just really can't get it through their skull that there's a possibility of tyranny happening in America.
[01:41:26.249 --> 01:41:27.910]  They really just don't get it.
[01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:28.931]  They just can't see it.
[01:41:28.931 --> 01:41:30.393]  They just can't see it coming.
[01:41:30.393 --> 01:41:33.255]  It's like literally a knife about to chop their neck.
[01:41:33.255 --> 01:41:34.957]  And it's like, no, that can't happen.
[01:41:34.957 --> 01:41:35.737]  I'm in America.
[01:41:35.737 --> 01:41:36.518]  That doesn't happen.
[01:41:36.518 --> 01:41:37.579]  And it's like, I think
[01:41:38.234 --> 01:41:54.380]  So it's time for everybody to realize and live in the real world and watch what's going on and listen to these globalists like Alex does and realize and take them at their word when they say, well, there's too many people on the planet.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:56.341]  Why don't you take my vaccine?
[01:41:56.341 --> 01:42:04.344]  And people can actually listen to Bill Gates and think he has your best interest at heart when he literally says he wants you gone.
[01:42:05.024 --> 01:42:07.247]  And he's got a vaccine for you?
[01:42:07.247 --> 01:42:14.735]  I mean, people have got to be just so silly, so stupid, so mind-controlled.
[01:42:14.735 --> 01:42:16.437]  It's just amazing.
[01:42:16.437 --> 01:42:18.800]  Let me shift topics here for one second.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:19.501]  Talking about
[01:42:20.041 --> 01:42:24.305]  Raising liberty, and the fact that you're here, and the fact that I'm here.
[01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:36.534]  Frank Cavanaugh, Michael Grange, who you're playing his song, we're actually creating this thing called the American Liberty Awards, and we're going to celebrate all of those liberty warriors out there.
[01:42:36.534 --> 01:42:45.542]  For example, there is an award called the Alex Jones Lifetime Achievement Award, and there is a Owen Schroer Man on the Street Award.
[01:42:45.862 --> 01:42:47.143]  Hold on, stay there.
[01:42:47.143 --> 01:42:55.252]  I want to hear about this and I want to get your five minutes live, not suppressed, not being screamed at, not being told to shut up by these city councils.
[01:42:55.252 --> 01:42:56.794]  Your address to the world, Matt Beggar.
[01:42:59.155 --> 01:43:06.897]  I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:43:06.897 --> 01:43:11.358]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously.
[01:43:11.358 --> 01:43:14.959]  It's election month, Alex.
[01:43:14.959 --> 01:43:16.520]  It's not election day.
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.200]  And that's the problem.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.961]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:23.722]  They illegally changed state elections.
[01:43:24.622 --> 01:43:30.164]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:43:30.164 --> 01:43:32.184]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:43:32.184 --> 01:43:36.445]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:43:36.445 --> 01:43:51.549]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections
[01:43:52.309 --> 01:43:54.410]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:58.472]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[01:43:58.472 --> 01:44:19.100]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:32.730]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:41.596]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:44:41.596 --> 01:44:47.841]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:49.522]  So, continue to do it.
[01:44:49.522 --> 01:44:51.724]  Go to places like Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:51.724 --> 01:44:53.826]  Go to the places like Save Infowars.
[01:44:53.826 --> 01:44:59.570]  Continue to keep Infowars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:00.531]  By the will of God!
[01:45:01.775 --> 01:45:11.244]  And by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent media.
[01:45:11.244 --> 01:45:12.865]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[01:45:12.865 --> 01:45:20.092]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[01:45:20.552 --> 01:45:24.996]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[01:45:24.996 --> 01:45:26.277]  And I need your support.
[01:45:26.277 --> 01:45:33.904]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:45:35.726 --> 01:45:38.028]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[01:46:03.147 --> 01:46:10.595]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:46:10.595 --> 01:46:12.497]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:13.959]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:46:13.959 --> 01:46:15.460]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:17.202]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:46:17.202 --> 01:46:18.443]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:46:18.443 --> 01:46:19.845]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:46:20.265 --> 01:46:25.110]  I studied The Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:46:25.110 --> 01:46:27.512]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:46:27.512 --> 01:46:29.534]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:46:29.534 --> 01:46:36.562]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to The Globalist agenda.
[01:46:37.102 --> 01:46:42.506]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:46:42.506 --> 01:46:51.433]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:46:51.433 --> 01:47:00.020]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.925]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:12.322 --> 01:47:12.523]  Yeah.
[01:47:26.032 --> 01:47:29.173]  Matt Baker's our guest here, final segment of this hour.
[01:47:29.173 --> 01:47:39.696]  And then we've got The Economist joining us, who predicted so many other big events, and he's saying a lot of critical things about the economy and the future of America.
[01:47:39.696 --> 01:47:41.776]  Martin Armstrong is really hard to get on.
[01:47:41.776 --> 01:47:44.837]  He's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:47:44.837 --> 01:47:46.357]  But Matt Baker, you got cut off.
[01:47:46.357 --> 01:47:55.300]  I want you to have your five minutes or longer here, if you're addressing the world, where you're not having people yell at you, or city councils, or legislators trying to shut you down, or school boards.
[01:47:56.016 --> 01:47:57.837]  But you were getting the Liberty Awards.
[01:47:57.837 --> 01:48:01.319]  I mean, I agree that we shouldn't lionize patriots.
[01:48:01.319 --> 01:48:03.840]  We should just support them because they're a representation of us.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.141]  But we should celebrate victory and liberty.
[01:48:06.141 --> 01:48:08.282]  So I didn't want to interrupt you, but we had to take that hard break.
[01:48:08.282 --> 01:48:10.563]  Go ahead.
[01:48:10.563 --> 01:48:11.984]  Well, I mean, I don't know.
[01:48:11.984 --> 01:48:13.624]  I think we should lionize them.
[01:48:13.624 --> 01:48:18.747]  You know, people have asked, and I've had arguments with people like, is Chris Sky a hero?
[01:48:18.747 --> 01:48:20.368]  Is Alex Jones a hero?
[01:48:20.368 --> 01:48:24.990]  I'm sorry to say you might not want to hear it, but the fact is you're a hero, Alex.
[01:48:25.907 --> 01:48:27.440]  And in this world...
[01:48:28.965 --> 01:48:31.126]  We need heroes.
[01:48:31.126 --> 01:48:36.049]  Well, there's no doubt the globalists target populist leaders that they see as folk heroes.
[01:48:36.049 --> 01:48:37.930]  All I'm saying is, this is the right thing to do.
[01:48:37.930 --> 01:48:41.231]  I don't see it as heroic to try to survive and fight tyranny, but I hear you.
[01:48:41.231 --> 01:48:44.613]  In a world of asleep people, those that are awake, I guess, are heroes.
[01:48:44.613 --> 01:48:52.397]  All I'm saying is, is that, you know, the military that lose their jobs, or firefighters not taking the shot, they're a hero for what they've done.
[01:48:52.397 --> 01:48:54.378]  I mean, I get what you're saying.
[01:48:54.378 --> 01:48:57.680]  But when the enemy attacks our leaders, we should rally behind them.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.420]  I think that's what you're saying.
[01:48:59.943 --> 01:49:06.586]  Yeah, I just simply think that, you know, people who make the greatest Liberty Song of the year should be out there.
[01:49:06.586 --> 01:49:09.368]  We should say, man, this guy really kicked ass, you know?
[01:49:09.368 --> 01:49:12.689]  This is the greatest Liberty Comedian of this year.
[01:49:12.689 --> 01:49:14.870]  This is the greatest man on the street.
[01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:19.392]  This is the greatest person who stood in front of the tank at Tiananmen Square.
[01:49:19.392 --> 01:49:22.474]  Even if the person's dead, we can give them a posthumous Liberty Award.
[01:49:22.474 --> 01:49:22.754]  Oh, no, I agree.
[01:49:22.754 --> 01:49:26.996]  The person at Tiananmen Square who reportedly did get tortured to death, that's a real hero right there.
[01:49:28.024 --> 01:49:29.585]  Julian Assange.
[01:49:29.585 --> 01:49:34.749]  Julian Assange is a nine-year solitary confinement platinum hero.
[01:49:34.749 --> 01:49:36.410]  He is a hero.
[01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.871]  Exactly.
[01:49:36.871 --> 01:49:37.731]  Here's the thing, Matt.
[01:49:37.731 --> 01:49:43.016]  I don't want to put myself in that category and I don't want to get in the category of being a political prisoner or being killed.
[01:49:43.016 --> 01:49:44.156]  Then I'll be a hero.
[01:49:44.156 --> 01:49:47.119]  I'm just doing what I need to do now because I hate tyranny.
[01:49:47.119 --> 01:49:48.940]  But exactly.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:53.323]  But let me say, brother, people like you who are inspired to take action are my heroes.
[01:49:53.323 --> 01:49:53.884]  But continue.
[01:49:55.034 --> 01:49:56.255]  Well, I'm sorry, Alex.
[01:49:56.255 --> 01:49:58.336]  You're just not going to beat me on this point.
[01:49:58.336 --> 01:49:59.016]  You're a hero.
[01:49:59.016 --> 01:49:59.637]  Sorry, that's it.
[01:49:59.637 --> 01:50:01.458]  It's just the way it is.
[01:50:01.458 --> 01:50:03.819]  I know you don't like it, but it's the reality.
[01:50:03.819 --> 01:50:11.224]  Anyway, instead of making sports heroes, or some girl who takes her top off and dances around being your hero,
[01:50:11.904 --> 01:50:16.548]  You know, or politicians like Nancy Pelosi is your hero?
[01:50:16.548 --> 01:50:20.251]  No, we need to get our priorities straight.
[01:50:20.251 --> 01:50:23.733]  We need to realize what is good.
[01:50:23.733 --> 01:50:30.539]  And at this point in the game, you know, our greatest people are the ones that are willing to say no, that are willing to stand up.
[01:50:30.959 --> 01:50:35.681]  That are willing to hold back the mind control that we're all under.
[01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:40.563]  We are under such heavy mind control as a species.
[01:50:40.563 --> 01:50:44.745]  We have to have people that are capable of breaking it.
[01:50:44.745 --> 01:50:47.546]  We have to say this person can see through the matrix.
[01:50:47.546 --> 01:50:48.306]  No, I totally agree.
[01:50:48.306 --> 01:50:51.808]  We should have also awards for people that break their conditioning.
[01:50:51.808 --> 01:50:54.949]  Like they broke the mind control, they broke the conditioning award.
[01:50:54.949 --> 01:50:57.690]  That should be the biggest award is someone new that broke free.
[01:50:59.179 --> 01:50:59.819]  Absolutely.
[01:50:59.819 --> 01:51:01.660]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:06.803]  You know, like, what's her name, the Democrat lady who just switched over?
[01:51:06.803 --> 01:51:08.523]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:51:08.523 --> 01:51:09.664]  Exactly, Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:51:09.664 --> 01:51:10.504]  Sorry, I forgot her name.
[01:51:10.504 --> 01:51:11.385]  She's awesome.
[01:51:11.385 --> 01:51:14.806]  You know, the waking up from the mind control.
[01:51:14.806 --> 01:51:15.747]  We have to realize
[01:51:16.625 --> 01:51:18.266]  Everything is mind control.
[01:51:18.266 --> 01:51:20.587]  The currency is thought.
[01:51:20.587 --> 01:51:25.230]  The currency, constantly they talk about money, power, control, votes.
[01:51:25.230 --> 01:51:26.510]  It's all the same thing.
[01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:27.591]  It's all control.
[01:51:27.591 --> 01:51:30.332]  It's all the currency of mind.
[01:51:30.332 --> 01:51:33.334]  And when they're controlling your mind, they own you.
[01:51:33.334 --> 01:51:45.500]  And so, they can pay you money to own you and make you work, or they can convince you through propaganda to own you, or they can pay someone... And freedom is the currency of human success and empowerment.
[01:51:46.514 --> 01:51:47.336]  Exactly.
[01:51:47.336 --> 01:51:48.598]  Liberty Coin.
[01:51:48.598 --> 01:51:53.505]  I know you don't want to do it, but honestly, I wish there was not just the silver dollars.
[01:51:53.505 --> 01:51:56.730]  I know you hate crypto, and I do too, but... No, I don't hate crypto.
[01:51:56.730 --> 01:51:58.233]  It's a great technology.
[01:51:58.233 --> 01:52:00.076]  It's just, it's so dangerous because it gets manipulated.
[01:52:01.004 --> 01:52:04.647]  Yeah, I just wish there was an actual Liberty-based coin.
[01:52:04.647 --> 01:52:07.449]  Like, actually, you make, let's say, a million.
[01:52:07.449 --> 01:52:08.389]  No, I totally agree.
[01:52:08.389 --> 01:52:12.252]  Let's get into that in the last five minute little segment the next hour before Armstrong joins us.
[01:52:12.252 --> 01:52:14.694]  But now we're coming down to six minutes to break.
[01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:25.301]  So, Matt Baker, if you're not being interrupted by the city councils or county commissions, and you've got five, six minutes to really tell folks your treatise, your magnum opus, you've got the floor.
[01:52:25.301 --> 01:52:26.282]  No pressure.
[01:52:26.282 --> 01:52:27.563]  Okay, here we go.
[01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:40.412]  People of Earth, humans, humanity, please listen.
[01:52:40.412 --> 01:52:42.513]  Please listen.
[01:52:42.513 --> 01:52:44.374]  We're on the edge.
[01:52:44.374 --> 01:52:54.659]  We're on the precipice of a very, very dark, deep, long nightmare controlled by robots.
[01:52:54.659 --> 01:52:55.619]  I'm not making it up.
[01:52:55.619 --> 01:52:56.540]  You know it's true.
[01:52:57.984 --> 01:53:01.445]  They're trying to control every single thought in your head.
[01:53:01.445 --> 01:53:04.145]  They're trying to control every place you go.
[01:53:04.145 --> 01:53:09.186]  They want to control every cell in your body.
[01:53:09.186 --> 01:53:11.087]  You're a human.
[01:53:11.087 --> 01:53:13.387]  And by that, you are with us.
[01:53:13.387 --> 01:53:15.308]  You are one of us.
[01:53:15.308 --> 01:53:16.908]  You must stop.
[01:53:16.908 --> 01:53:18.688]  You must force.
[01:53:18.688 --> 01:53:26.790]  You must push this tyranny back deep into the hole
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.942]  Where it came from.
[01:53:29.942 --> 01:53:31.763]  All of the Senators.
[01:53:31.763 --> 01:53:32.723]  All of the people.
[01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:33.684]  All of the children.
[01:53:33.684 --> 01:53:36.306]  I want you to go back in your mind.
[01:53:36.306 --> 01:53:45.051]  I want you to remember what it was like when you held a sparkler and you looked at the American flag and you heard the Star Spangled Banner play.
[01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.573]  And it meant something to you.
[01:53:47.573 --> 01:53:49.254]  Freedom meant something to you.
[01:53:49.254 --> 01:53:52.276]  Your life means something.
[01:53:52.276 --> 01:53:55.038]  Hold it dear.
[01:53:56.733 --> 01:53:58.073]  Hold it near.
[01:53:58.073 --> 01:53:59.654]  Hold your loved ones.
[01:53:59.654 --> 01:54:06.075]  Look into your children's eyes and tell them I am going to create a future you will be free in.
[01:54:06.075 --> 01:54:11.035]  You will find freedom in the future that I am building for you.
[01:54:11.035 --> 01:54:13.196]  I will not give in.
[01:54:13.196 --> 01:54:15.856]  I will not stand down.
[01:54:15.856 --> 01:54:18.737]  I will not give in.
[01:54:18.737 --> 01:54:23.918]  This tyranny will not control my eternal soul.
[01:54:27.208 --> 01:54:29.930]  My heart, my being, my everything?
[01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:31.872]  You're everything.
[01:54:31.872 --> 01:54:34.815]  Our everything.
[01:54:34.815 --> 01:54:37.257]  We are everything.
[01:54:37.257 --> 01:54:39.018]  We are consciousness.
[01:54:39.018 --> 01:54:40.439]  We are strength.
[01:54:40.439 --> 01:54:41.600]  We are being.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.821]  We are alive.
[01:54:42.821 --> 01:54:44.283]  We are creativity.
[01:54:44.283 --> 01:54:45.604]  We are the universe.
[01:54:45.604 --> 01:54:47.245]  We are the magnificent.
[01:54:47.245 --> 01:54:48.867]  We are the thoughts of God.
[01:54:48.867 --> 01:54:50.708]  We are the minds.
[01:54:50.708 --> 01:54:51.989]  We are the spirits of life.
[01:54:53.570 --> 01:54:55.132]  We are beautiful.
[01:54:55.132 --> 01:55:03.520]  Harness everything that has been given to you and use it in this battle for victory.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:06.623]  I'm sorry.
[01:55:06.623 --> 01:55:07.684]  That's all I could say.
[01:55:09.045 --> 01:55:12.626]  Brother, that's so powerful and so beautiful, and you're absolutely right.
[01:55:12.626 --> 01:55:27.310]  We have to know that our interfacing, loving a sunset, or loving our children, or loving our wives, our husbands, loving our family, loving goodness, is communion with God that created the universe, and they want us to hate ourselves and not believe in that and realize that
[01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:32.655]  Our very existence is magic, and our very free will is what God gave us.
[01:55:32.655 --> 01:55:40.803]  And we must come together and realize that, and that if we individually change our hearts and souls, that will at a cellular level change the body politic.
[01:55:40.803 --> 01:55:41.804]  And that's where the answer is.
[01:55:41.804 --> 01:55:51.014]  That's why they dump cultural poison and evil on us, to turn us against each other, because they're afraid of humans that are just millimeters from inheriting this great destiny.
[01:55:53.944 --> 01:55:55.045]  Oh, man.
[01:55:55.045 --> 01:55:58.306]  Yeah, you let me bear it out there, Alex.
[01:55:58.306 --> 01:56:01.028]  You know, I don't write these things down.
[01:56:01.028 --> 01:56:06.450]  I just go off the cuff, and it's a heavy burden to actually try and speak to the entire planet.
[01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:09.091]  But I do what I can, man.
[01:56:09.091 --> 01:56:11.152]  I just want everybody to know you're not alone.
[01:56:11.152 --> 01:56:11.813]  We're out here.
[01:56:11.813 --> 01:56:13.614]  I want you to get up off your couch.
[01:56:13.614 --> 01:56:14.814]  I want you to go to the window.
[01:56:14.814 --> 01:56:19.136]  I want you to say, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[01:56:19.136 --> 01:56:20.837]  That's beautiful.
[01:56:20.837 --> 01:56:21.517]  You're right.
[01:56:21.517 --> 01:56:22.838]  The first step is saying, I'm
[01:56:22.878 --> 01:56:28.002]  I'm independent, I have free will, I love justice, I love beauty, I love freedom, and I'm beautiful.
[01:56:28.002 --> 01:56:44.357]  Whether you have money or don't have money, whether you have a mom or, it doesn't matter, a mom or dad, you are beautiful, God made you, and you're incredible, and don't let them trick you into committing suicide, don't let them trick you into hating yourself, as long as you love God, you are the richest person on earth.
[01:56:44.357 --> 01:56:47.920]  The currency of life, the currency of friendship, the currency of truth,
[01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:50.657]  The currency, it's just the energy.
[01:56:50.657 --> 01:56:57.682]  They try to destroy and bastardize everything that is thought and everything that is the currency.
[01:56:57.682 --> 01:57:00.624]  The true meaning, the true heart.
[01:57:00.624 --> 01:57:02.546]  You know, your word is bond.
[01:57:02.546 --> 01:57:04.708]  You have to have integrity.
[01:57:04.708 --> 01:57:07.310]  Without integrity, you are nothing.
[01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:09.131]  Consciousness is currency.
[01:57:09.131 --> 01:57:12.033]  It is the real currency of the universe.
[01:57:12.033 --> 01:57:12.854]  Exactly.
[01:57:12.854 --> 01:57:13.475]  You said it.
[01:57:13.475 --> 01:57:14.315]  That's it.
[01:57:14.315 --> 01:57:17.338]  E equals currency equals consciousness.
[01:57:17.338 --> 01:57:17.618]  That's it.
[01:57:18.371 --> 01:57:21.874]  And we have together today released the equation to the Holy Spirit.
[01:57:21.874 --> 01:57:22.895]  That is it.
[01:57:22.895 --> 01:57:24.276]  Consciousness is currency.
[01:57:24.276 --> 01:57:25.637]  Consciousness is life.
[01:57:25.637 --> 01:57:27.058]  Consciousness is eternal.
[01:57:27.058 --> 01:57:31.482]  We have released the transmission that will defeat the AI and the whole system.
[01:57:31.482 --> 01:57:34.304]  Currency is consciousness.
[01:57:34.304 --> 01:57:36.266]  Consciousness is currency.
[01:57:36.266 --> 01:57:37.807]  We have everything.
[01:57:37.807 --> 01:57:40.850]  We can build beyond anything we've ever imagined.
[01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:42.531]  I'm on fire with chills.
[01:57:42.531 --> 01:57:45.374]  Final segment with Matt Baker and then The Economist.

[01:58:41.690 --> 01:58:44.091]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[01:58:44.091 --> 01:58:47.092]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[01:58:48.143 --> 01:58:59.632]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:58:59.632 --> 01:59:04.096]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:59:04.096 --> 01:59:08.059]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:59:08.059 --> 01:59:12.503]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:59:12.503 --> 01:59:13.584]  You see, the sun
[01:59:14.244 --> 01:59:14.584]  I think so.
[01:59:38.206 --> 01:59:39.027]  I want you to get up now.
[01:59:39.027 --> 01:59:40.588]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[02:00:06.741 --> 02:00:17.107]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[02:00:17.107 --> 02:00:28.234]  I want you to get up right now, stick your head out of the window, open it, and stick your head out and keep yelling and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL, I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
[02:00:28.234 --> 02:00:31.856]  Just get up from your chairs, right now, go to the window!
[02:00:31.856 --> 02:00:32.476]  Where are you going?
[02:00:32.476 --> 02:00:33.717]  I don't wanna see if anybody's yelling!
[02:00:33.717 --> 02:00:35.398]  Open it, and stick your head out!
[02:00:49.389 --> 02:00:51.430]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:53.411]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:00:53.411 --> 02:00:56.372]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:00:56.372 --> 02:00:58.193]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:00:58.193 --> 02:00:59.674]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:00:59.674 --> 02:01:00.815]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:01:00.815 --> 02:01:04.357]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:01:04.357 --> 02:01:07.739]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:01:07.739 --> 02:01:10.180]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!
[02:01:30.829 --> 02:01:33.271]  Zelensky is a demon incarnate.
[02:01:33.271 --> 02:01:36.514]  He tried to start a nuclear war the last two days, but he failed.
[02:01:36.514 --> 02:01:42.518]  All right, in closing, Matt Baker, really appreciate you, brother.
[02:01:42.518 --> 02:01:45.801]  Anything else you'd like to add to the viewers before Mr. Armstrong joins us?
[02:01:47.710 --> 02:01:51.731]  Um, well, actually, man, you just got me, you got me to go all there.
[02:01:51.731 --> 02:01:58.172]  I mean, I'm literally crying my eyes out over here, barely in the break, dude, hanging on, barely hanging on.
[02:01:58.172 --> 02:02:00.613]  You know, I said it before, I'll say it again.
[02:02:00.613 --> 02:02:09.575]  The amount of anger that you hear in my rants is based on the amount I love the world and I love
[02:02:12.481 --> 02:02:19.228]  I love everybody and I want the world to succeed and that's when I see it being stolen, when I see like a baby's throat being slit.
[02:02:19.228 --> 02:02:28.077]  That's how much I love that baby is how mad I'm getting and that's why I channel this energy which seems like hate or anger.
[02:02:28.077 --> 02:02:34.905]  It's really directly proportional to the amount which I actually love the universe and I love life.
[02:02:35.785 --> 02:02:38.608]  And I want people to realize how precious it really is.
[02:02:38.608 --> 02:02:41.790]  And we just can't let it slip through our fingers, man.
[02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:42.311]  Absolutely.
[02:02:42.311 --> 02:02:45.754]  You're showing your resistance to their evil.
[02:02:45.754 --> 02:02:46.754]  Yeah.
[02:02:46.754 --> 02:02:47.835]  I have a great song.
[02:02:47.835 --> 02:02:50.498]  I wrote it a long time ago, back in the pandemic.
[02:02:50.498 --> 02:02:54.541]  It's a takeoff on Ground Control to Major Tom.
[02:02:54.541 --> 02:02:57.163]  It's Mind Control to Major Scam.
[02:02:57.163 --> 02:03:00.366]  I wish you would play it in your breaks every once in a while.
[02:03:00.366 --> 02:03:00.926]  I haven't heard it.
[02:03:00.926 --> 02:03:01.547]  I'll watch it.
[02:03:01.547 --> 02:03:02.567]  Where do we find it?
[02:03:03.908 --> 02:03:05.049]  It's on band.
[02:03:05.049 --> 02:03:06.890]  I actually sent it to Daria earlier.
[02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:08.391]  You can play it.
[02:03:08.391 --> 02:03:09.571]  She's got the link.
[02:03:09.571 --> 02:03:10.352]  You can do it later.
[02:03:10.352 --> 02:03:10.992]  Whatever, man.
[02:03:10.992 --> 02:03:14.814]  What we'll do is we're live now, but we'll add it in post at the end of the interview.
[02:03:14.814 --> 02:03:18.976]  We'll add... What's the name of the video again?
[02:03:18.976 --> 02:03:20.737]  Mind Control to Major Scam.
[02:03:20.737 --> 02:03:24.940]  I don't know if it comes up as that on there, but Daria has the link.
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:30.763]  We'll add it at the end of this interview, because we're live right now at 103 Central Time, but later today this will be in band.
[02:03:32.202 --> 02:03:37.827]  And beyond anger and beyond being mad as hell, you know, the greatest victory is living a good life.
[02:03:37.827 --> 02:03:39.368]  Like, I like to have fun.
[02:03:39.368 --> 02:03:41.510]  I like to make art.
[02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:43.091]  I like to make music.
[02:03:43.091 --> 02:03:45.453]  You know, I like to create and generate things.
[02:03:45.453 --> 02:03:47.235]  This wall behind me, I built.
[02:03:47.235 --> 02:03:49.757]  I'm sitting in a room that I'm actually working.
[02:03:49.757 --> 02:03:51.058]  I'm on a job site right now.
[02:03:51.058 --> 02:03:52.839]  I'm not in a podcast studio.
[02:03:52.839 --> 02:03:55.582]  I'm literally in the building that I built with my bare hands.
[02:03:56.402 --> 02:04:03.066]  I'm working construction, I'm fighting for freedom, I'm doing music, I'm doing art, I'm getting out, I'm speaking out.
[02:04:03.066 --> 02:04:13.933]  And it started as a joke, but play on words because of the Slave to Liberty logo, but it's becoming a reality that I am a slave to liberty.
[02:04:16.172 --> 02:04:17.213]  I can't stop.
[02:04:17.213 --> 02:04:20.896]  I have to maintain liberty.
[02:04:20.896 --> 02:04:22.237]  I have to maintain freedom.
[02:04:22.237 --> 02:04:24.559]  It's like people become a slave to Jesus Christ.
[02:04:24.559 --> 02:04:25.360]  It sounds strange.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:28.203]  It's like, I'm a slave to Jesus and I've never been happier.
[02:04:29.797 --> 02:04:34.241]  You have to have a meaning in life, and you have to create art.
[02:04:34.241 --> 02:04:37.143]  It's not just about, you know, standing up against them.
[02:04:37.143 --> 02:04:39.806]  It's also about creating our own things.
[02:04:39.806 --> 02:04:40.606]  I totally agree.
[02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:41.967]  We don't just stand against them.
[02:04:41.967 --> 02:04:45.530]  We build the new world, and that is how we win.
[02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:46.491]  Imagine that.
[02:04:46.491 --> 02:04:48.073]  All right, Matt Baker, amazing interview.
[02:04:48.073 --> 02:04:48.873]  Off the charts, good.
[02:04:48.873 --> 02:04:50.635]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:50.635 --> 02:04:51.115]  Thanks, man.
[02:04:51.115 --> 02:04:52.056]  Appreciate it.
[02:04:52.056 --> 02:04:55.138]  All right, we'll give you the latest economic analysis straight ahead.
[02:04:55.138 --> 02:04:55.539]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.594 --> 02:05:06.938]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:05:06.938 --> 02:05:18.568]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:05:18.568 --> 02:05:25.434]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalists' number
[02:05:25.834 --> 02:05:26.414]  We're good to go.
[02:06:02.619 --> 02:06:05.701]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:06:05.701 --> 02:06:06.041]  I'm sick.
[02:06:06.041 --> 02:06:06.681]  Just let me sick.
[02:06:06.681 --> 02:06:12.145]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:06:12.145 --> 02:06:13.846]  It's Chancellor Sattler.
[02:06:13.846 --> 02:06:14.206]  Damn it!
[02:06:14.206 --> 02:06:15.287]  Why?
[02:06:15.287 --> 02:06:21.891]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:06:21.891 --> 02:06:25.054]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen,
[02:06:27.998 --> 02:06:32.662]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:06:32.662 --> 02:06:33.683]  You decided, sir.
[02:06:33.683 --> 02:06:34.623]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:06:34.623 --> 02:06:36.265]  You taught me every television in London!
[02:06:36.265 --> 02:06:38.386]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:06:38.386 --> 02:06:40.188]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:06:40.188 --> 02:06:49.836]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[02:06:49.836 --> 02:06:50.076]  Cameras.
[02:06:50.076 --> 02:06:51.037]  We need cameras.
[02:06:51.037 --> 02:06:52.498]  How did this happen?
[02:06:52.498 --> 02:06:53.258]  Who's to blame?
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:56.885]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:06:56.885 --> 02:06:58.808]  They will be held accountable.
[02:06:58.808 --> 02:07:04.680]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:07:05.876 --> 02:07:07.477]  I know why you did it.
[02:07:07.477 --> 02:07:09.357]  I know you were afraid.
[02:07:09.357 --> 02:07:11.098]  Who wouldn't be?
[02:07:11.098 --> 02:07:11.358]  War?
[02:07:11.358 --> 02:07:11.818]  Terror?
[02:07:11.818 --> 02:07:13.279]  Disease?
[02:07:13.279 --> 02:07:19.722]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:07:19.722 --> 02:07:25.964]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:07:25.964 --> 02:07:32.267]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:07:39.005 --> 02:07:40.688]  There is a war.
[02:07:40.688 --> 02:07:42.570]  It's happening now.
[02:07:42.570 --> 02:07:44.933]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:07:44.933 --> 02:07:47.537]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:07:47.537 --> 02:07:49.440]  We are the resistance.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.002]  We are the Infowar.
[02:08:04.651 --> 02:08:09.523]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:08:09.523 --> 02:08:10.986]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.494 --> 02:08:19.456]  All right, I've been following his work for 20 years.
[02:08:19.456 --> 02:08:23.359]  Martin Armstrong is an economist, an inventor, stock market expert.
[02:08:23.359 --> 02:08:24.420]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio.
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:25.641]  It would take an hour.
[02:08:25.641 --> 02:08:27.683]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:08:27.683 --> 02:08:30.865]  Ask-Socrates.com.
[02:08:30.865 --> 02:08:32.947]  Ask-Socrates.com.
[02:08:32.947 --> 02:08:38.231]  And he has been, for several years, here on air predicting exactly what we're going through now.
[02:08:39.472 --> 02:08:48.559]  So, I would ask him to cut to the chase with what he's predicting is about to happen, and then walk through the mechanics of all of that, because we need to be ready for what is taking place.
[02:08:48.559 --> 02:08:53.582]  A major political realignment, a major economic realignment taking place on the planet.
[02:08:53.582 --> 02:08:58.786]  Klaus Schwab, two days ago, G20 saying, America's power is over.
[02:08:58.786 --> 02:09:02.128]  I mean, they are really setting us up for a fall.
[02:09:02.128 --> 02:09:06.011]  So, Mr. Armstrong, great to have you with us here today.
[02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:07.052]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:09:08.243 --> 02:09:10.543]  Well, thank you for inviting me, Alex.
[02:09:10.543 --> 02:09:13.584]  So, I'm going to try to give you the floor for most of the hour.
[02:09:13.584 --> 02:09:19.045]  You want to give us the big picture first and walk through it, or you want to start with the technicals and give us the answer?
[02:09:19.045 --> 02:09:21.706]  How do you want to start here?
[02:09:21.706 --> 02:09:27.247]  Well, I think that, you know, people have to understand what is actually taking place here.
[02:09:27.247 --> 02:09:33.708]  Because a lot of it is just propaganda that tends to try to distract people.
[02:09:35.278 --> 02:09:44.186]  I mean, for years, you know, I've been basically on the opposite side of Schwab in meetings for a long time.
[02:09:44.186 --> 02:09:57.318]  And the reason these governments are lining up with Schwab is because we have a sovereign debt crisis and that's what's taking place.
[02:10:00.261 --> 02:10:05.666]  We've been borrowing since World War II with no intention of ever paying anything back.
[02:10:05.666 --> 02:10:20.560]  And the real crisis here that is developing is that what Yellen came out and was saying that, oh, maybe the Treasury should step in and start buying long-term debt, etc.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.341]  And the reason
[02:10:22.348 --> 02:10:28.394]  Is that the amount of new debt that came out over COVID exploded.
[02:10:28.394 --> 02:10:32.458]  And now you have this Ukrainian war.
[02:10:32.458 --> 02:10:45.850]  And what she's really concerned about is that we have surpassed the ability of basically the primary dealers to even buy the debt.
[02:10:46.801 --> 02:10:53.206]  And people have to understand that the US government traditionally never sold the debt itself.
[02:10:53.206 --> 02:10:56.989]  It went to the bankers and the bankers are the ones that sold it.
[02:10:56.989 --> 02:11:04.615]  So to be a primary dealer, you have to get on the list and you have to guarantee to buy X amount.
[02:11:04.615 --> 02:11:07.518]  And the problem is, is that as we saw in the UK,
[02:11:10.602 --> 02:11:16.104]  You can't imagine the losses that pension funds have endured.
[02:11:16.104 --> 02:11:23.187]  They've had long-term bonds and the EU was issuing debt negative in 2014.
[02:11:23.187 --> 02:11:28.429]  So all of a sudden you have interest rates soaring to 4%.
[02:11:28.429 --> 02:11:33.690]  The value of those bonds has been collapsing.
[02:11:33.690 --> 02:11:38.212]  So what Yellen was talking about, some people miss
[02:11:40.471 --> 02:11:45.172]  Interpreted it and saying that, oh, she's competing with the Federal Reserve.
[02:11:45.172 --> 02:11:46.873]  And that's not true.
[02:11:46.873 --> 02:11:48.473]  The Fed creates the money.
[02:11:48.473 --> 02:11:50.333]  The Treasury does not.
[02:11:50.333 --> 02:11:56.755]  She was talking about buying in long term debt and swapping it for short term.
[02:11:56.755 --> 02:12:06.257]  In other words, that interest rates have been going up so much that what's happened is, is that the bond market itself has been collapsing.
[02:12:06.934 --> 02:12:10.196]  That was the real problem in the UK.
[02:12:10.196 --> 02:12:14.519]  And so she recognizes a twofold problem here.
[02:12:14.519 --> 02:12:19.042]  One is that as interest rates are going up, nobody wants the long term.
[02:12:19.042 --> 02:12:20.943]  They lose too much money.
[02:12:20.943 --> 02:12:35.073]  And two, you have the primary dealers are choking on the debt, because if they have to buy it to keep their franchise, but can't sell it, then you're looking at taking down the banks, you know, like Goldman and all the primary dealers.
[02:12:35.985 --> 02:12:44.030]  So they were largely complaining and that's why she came out and was talking about swapping the debt.
[02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:53.256]  And what Schwab has been tapping into is that these governments know that the jig is up.
[02:12:53.256 --> 02:12:55.497]  If they can't sell the long-term debt,
[02:12:56.491 --> 02:13:02.953]  You know, they can no longer continue to fund their appropriations.
[02:13:02.953 --> 02:13:07.655]  And so what you're looking at is a real debt crisis.
[02:13:07.655 --> 02:13:14.818]  And they've been using this Ukrainian war, they needed distraction.
[02:13:14.818 --> 02:13:16.958]  I mean, COVID was one.
[02:13:16.958 --> 02:13:24.441]  But honestly, they ended up, you know, exploding the debt all around the world.
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:28.443]  And now they can't really fund it.
[02:13:28.443 --> 02:13:34.967]  And as interest rates go up, the interest expenditures on the government explode.
[02:13:34.967 --> 02:13:41.993]  So, you know, people have to understand that, you know, Keynesian economics was formed in the Great Depression.
[02:13:41.993 --> 02:13:47.497]  And when, you know, he came up with that idea, the United States had a balanced budget.
[02:13:48.607 --> 02:14:08.208]  So you know he basically said that's when the government should enter a deficit because the demand in the private sector is contracting and to ease the economy the government spending should increase to compensate for the contraction in the private.
[02:14:08.208 --> 02:14:09.589]  Now the problem was once you
[02:14:11.443 --> 02:14:15.524]  I mean, they took one sentence from Keynes and ignored the rest of it.
[02:14:15.524 --> 02:14:20.325]  Keynes also said, you know, you can stimulate the economy by lowering
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:44.984]  Taxes, you know, they, you know, they go into convulsions if you ever suggest such a thing.
[02:14:44.984 --> 02:14:46.264]  I mean, how dare we?
[02:14:46.264 --> 02:14:48.205]  We always need more.
[02:14:48.205 --> 02:15:04.374]  And so, you know, for 40 some years, I've been dealing with governments and our political system, I think, is collapsing largely because nobody will ever address anything long term.
[02:15:05.894 --> 02:15:12.401]  When I've been in meetings and I said, listen, we can't continue this borrowing indefinitely.
[02:15:12.401 --> 02:15:19.429]  And they would respond, yes, but we're different with the government thinking that somebody will always buy their debt.
[02:15:19.429 --> 02:15:23.173]  And secondly, that they've always said, well,
[02:15:24.051 --> 02:15:27.354]  You know, you're talking about something that may hit in 20 years.
[02:15:27.354 --> 02:15:28.735]  I won't be here then.
[02:15:28.735 --> 02:15:30.536]  So that would be somebody else's problem.
[02:15:30.536 --> 02:15:31.116]  All right, stand there.
[02:15:31.116 --> 02:15:32.077]  We got to go to break.
[02:15:32.077 --> 02:15:35.460]  Martin Armstrong, famous economist, amazing at predicting things.
[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:38.722]  We've seen senators and House members say, though, we have unlimited money.
[02:15:38.722 --> 02:15:39.963]  Government can never run out of money.
[02:15:39.963 --> 02:15:41.945]  But we're now coming to that point.
[02:15:41.945 --> 02:15:43.126]  How does this thing break?
[02:15:43.126 --> 02:15:45.828]  What do you see unfolding when you talk about
[02:15:46.897 --> 02:15:49.866]  The end of America, the end of the dollar and more with Martin Armstrong.
[02:15:49.866 --> 02:15:50.447]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:15:50.447 --> 02:15:51.290]  Stay with us.
[02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:52.293]  InfoWars.com.
[02:15:52.293 --> 02:15:53.636]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:53.636 --> 02:15:54.739]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:15:58.183 --> 02:16:09.672]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:16:09.672 --> 02:16:14.116]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:16:14.116 --> 02:16:18.079]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:16:18.079 --> 02:16:21.582]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:16:21.582 --> 02:16:22.823]  You see, the sun
[02:16:24.324 --> 02:16:24.684]  We're good to go!
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.961]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:55.343]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[02:16:55.343 --> 02:16:56.663]  This family that is InfoWars.
[02:17:12.731 --> 02:17:28.943]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[02:17:28.943 --> 02:17:38.050]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[02:17:39.324 --> 02:17:41.025]  I don't take the credit.
[02:17:41.025 --> 02:17:42.726]  I give you the credit.
[02:17:42.726 --> 02:17:45.348]  And now, InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[02:17:45.348 --> 02:17:46.950]  It isn't going to give up.
[02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:48.791]  Without your support, we could be shut down.
[02:17:48.791 --> 02:17:52.073]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[02:17:52.073 --> 02:17:58.037]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[02:17:58.037 --> 02:18:04.002]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:18:05.313 --> 02:18:15.682]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:18:15.682 --> 02:18:28.433]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:18:29.093 --> 02:18:40.599]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:18:40.599 --> 02:18:48.803]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[02:18:48.803 --> 02:18:56.967]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[02:18:58.124 --> 02:19:09.435]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:19:09.435 --> 02:19:11.337]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:19:11.337 --> 02:19:12.799]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:19:12.799 --> 02:19:14.320]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.042]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:19:16.042 --> 02:19:17.283]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:19:17.283 --> 02:19:18.685]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:19:19.105 --> 02:19:23.950]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:26.332]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:19:26.332 --> 02:19:28.354]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:19:28.354 --> 02:19:35.301]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:19:35.942 --> 02:19:41.346]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:19:41.346 --> 02:19:50.272]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:19:50.272 --> 02:19:58.998]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:19:58.998 --> 02:20:04.902]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.271 --> 02:20:09.476]  Yeah.
[02:20:14.985 --> 02:20:15.625]  All right.
[02:20:15.625 --> 02:20:17.846]  One of the top economists out there.
[02:20:17.846 --> 02:20:19.686]  We spent a whole hour about his bio.
[02:20:19.686 --> 02:20:20.766]  I'm not going to do it.
[02:20:20.766 --> 02:20:21.546]  It's Martin Armstrong.
[02:20:21.546 --> 02:20:25.407]  He has predicted everything that's happened in the last 25, 30 years.
[02:20:25.407 --> 02:20:27.048]  And he's here making some really scary predictions.
[02:20:27.048 --> 02:20:30.028]  We're coming to an end of a cycle, an end of a system.
[02:20:30.028 --> 02:20:33.429]  I have the head of the European Central Bank saying, we're coming to an end.
[02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:34.209]  It's collapsing.
[02:20:34.209 --> 02:20:40.170]  We've got to move to a new digital currency that controls every facet of our lives and creates a new Ponzi scheme with carbon taxes.
[02:20:40.170 --> 02:20:42.591]  So you're getting into all the technicals last segment.
[02:20:43.456 --> 02:20:54.582]  We need to drill back into those, Martin, but big picture, how would you describe the world economy, the different players, the different groups, and where we're at, and what are you predicting is about to happen?
[02:20:54.582 --> 02:21:09.351]  Well, what they've been doing is we have, we have, I would say, another little group that really have the White House in control, and they're the climate change people.
[02:21:10.297 --> 02:21:22.397]  And they are the ones that are really, I'm not sure if they're just completely insane or they actually know what they're doing, but trying to shut down fossils.
[02:21:23.348 --> 02:21:30.710]  fuels on a global scale without alternatives already in place is really insane.
[02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:33.590]  And this is causing the civil unrest to rise.
[02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:37.851]  And we're seeing that outside the United States first.
[02:21:37.851 --> 02:21:43.172]  Eventually, we'll get to the United States, but we're looking at probably a lot more civil unrest next year.
[02:21:43.172 --> 02:21:50.214]  And we have to understand that energy is priced in dollars.
[02:21:50.214 --> 02:21:52.394]  So as the dollar has been going up,
[02:21:53.289 --> 02:21:56.894]  Uh, their energy costs have exploded.
[02:21:56.894 --> 02:22:03.843]  And this is why you're seeing civil unrest in everywhere from Asia and Sri Lanka to Pakistan.
[02:22:03.843 --> 02:22:08.890]  You know, it's just spreading and it will continue.
[02:22:10.302 --> 02:22:13.443]  Thanks also, you know, to the COVID lockdowns, etc.
[02:22:13.443 --> 02:22:21.685]  I mean, we just had a conference in Orlando last week, and like three of our staff, they wouldn't even let into the country.
[02:22:21.685 --> 02:22:26.626]  You know, they're stranded off in Dubai.
[02:22:26.626 --> 02:22:31.127]  But it's just, you know, this is what's happening.
[02:22:31.127 --> 02:22:33.287]  The economic system
[02:22:33.943 --> 02:22:40.229]  That we've been under with these people and the central banks are no longer able to really control anything.
[02:22:42.637 --> 02:22:53.420]  Raising interest rates to stop inflation only makes more inflation, because this type of inflation is based upon shortages.
[02:22:53.420 --> 02:23:08.764]  The COVID nonsense, lockdown, everything that we had as far as the supply chain, and as a result... By the way, just to interrupt you, the head of the European Central Bank just said yesterday they're losing control.
[02:23:08.764 --> 02:23:11.625]  To have a central bank head saying they're losing control,
[02:23:12.756 --> 02:23:16.158]  That's got to be a terrifying statement.
[02:23:16.158 --> 02:23:16.999]  Yes.
[02:23:16.999 --> 02:23:19.340]  You know, this is what we saw in London.
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:24.524]  OK, that the long term debt, nobody wants it.
[02:23:24.524 --> 02:23:28.947]  You've wiped out all the pension funds in Europe.
[02:23:28.947 --> 02:23:30.248]  They're broke.
[02:23:30.248 --> 02:23:30.708]  All right.
[02:23:30.708 --> 02:23:34.951]  You took interest rates to negative in 2014.
[02:23:34.951 --> 02:23:40.855]  And then you also had a law saying that pension funds had to be secure and had to buy government debt.
[02:23:41.539 --> 02:23:44.841]  I mean, they need 8% to break even.
[02:23:44.841 --> 02:23:48.864]  We have, you know, as you know, you know, we're probably the largest in the world.
[02:23:48.864 --> 02:23:55.529]  We have clients with portfolios of over a trillion dollars and we get requests.
[02:23:55.529 --> 02:23:59.312]  Can you create a green portfolio that they just break even?
[02:23:59.312 --> 02:24:07.278]  Because they have to have green investments politically to satisfy the politicians, but they lose money on everything.
[02:24:08.064 --> 02:24:11.745]  I mean, it's an absolute insane world that we're looking at.
[02:24:11.745 --> 02:24:12.705]  And that's the SEGs.
[02:24:12.705 --> 02:24:15.606]  Explain SEGs.
[02:24:15.606 --> 02:24:20.887]  Well, basically, there's nothing that they can actually make money on.
[02:24:20.887 --> 02:24:25.368]  I mean, you just look at Germany.
[02:24:25.368 --> 02:24:32.149]  I mean, these people are so climate insane that they don't even want nuclear power.
[02:24:33.334 --> 02:24:44.883]  I mean, I think the former head of Greenpeace came out and said to AOC, I mean, how are people going to get their food into the into cities, horse and buggy?
[02:24:44.883 --> 02:24:48.805]  I mean, it's gotten really insane with these people.
[02:24:48.805 --> 02:24:58.693]  And they are looking at it, saying that they have to destroy as much of our energy capacity to produce.
[02:24:59.858 --> 02:25:03.739]  In case the other side gets back in, they won't be able to rebuild it.
[02:25:03.739 --> 02:25:05.480]  And that's really what they're trying to do.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:11.401]  Quantify that, that's so huge, because they have all the energy heads saying, we're in transition, we're destroying the old system.
[02:25:11.401 --> 02:25:13.382]  You said, quote, so the other side can't get in.
[02:25:13.382 --> 02:25:14.042]  That is so key.
[02:25:14.042 --> 02:25:16.063]  Elaborate on that.
[02:25:16.063 --> 02:25:24.345]  Yeah, I mean, if you destroy most of your capacity, your ability to produce energy,
[02:25:25.228 --> 02:25:26.029]  All right.
[02:25:26.029 --> 02:25:26.990]  That's what they want.
[02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:30.915]  They don't want us to be able to go ever go back to fossil fuels.
[02:25:30.915 --> 02:25:38.844]  This is really why the West is using Ukraine as cannon fodder against Russia.
[02:25:38.844 --> 02:25:40.886]  Russia is the biggest energy producer.
[02:25:40.886 --> 02:25:42.708]  50% of their GDP is all energy.
[02:25:45.504 --> 02:25:49.728]  It's why the U.S., you know, basically took out their pipeline.
[02:25:49.728 --> 02:25:53.511]  If you go back to Syria, why did Obama wanted to go into Syria?
[02:25:53.511 --> 02:26:00.858]  Because Qatar wanted to put a pipeline through Syria to cut off the supply from Russia, and he refused.
[02:26:00.858 --> 02:26:07.665]  And so right away he wanted to go in and say, oh, they abused their people, but he lost.
[02:26:07.665 --> 02:26:11.048]  And we, you know, Americans are getting tired of these endless wars.
[02:26:13.395 --> 02:26:20.500]  I was actually, went to Mar-a-Lago to see Trump back in March of 2020.
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:27.685]  And I've met many heads of state, but I will say this for all the people that don't like Trump.
[02:26:27.685 --> 02:26:30.947]  I was actually impressed for the first time.
[02:26:30.947 --> 02:26:38.233]  He was a world leader and he actually said that he wanted to pull the troops out of Afghanistan.
[02:26:38.965 --> 02:26:46.008]  Because he was sick and tired of writing letters to their parents and saying their son died for God and country.
[02:26:46.008 --> 02:26:50.390]  And he said, point blank, he says, what are we there for?
[02:26:50.390 --> 02:26:53.172]  They've been fighting over borders for a thousand years.
[02:26:53.172 --> 02:26:55.373]  What difference are we going to make?
[02:26:55.373 --> 02:27:00.435]  That's why Bolton came out and oh, he has to be, he's terrible president, blah, blah, blah.
[02:27:00.435 --> 02:27:04.777]  But he was the first head of state of any country that I ever encountered.
[02:27:05.783 --> 02:27:10.866]  Whoever was concerned about the people that actually died on the battlefield.
[02:27:10.866 --> 02:27:16.730]  I mean, they all want, oh, look, this is a war we have to defeat Russia, we should push them out.
[02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:18.651]  How many lives is that going to cost?
[02:27:18.651 --> 02:27:27.056]  How many children will be, you know, lose their fathers and grow up as, you know, without, you know... Martin, I totally agree.
[02:27:27.056 --> 02:27:27.857]  We got to go to break again.
[02:27:27.857 --> 02:27:28.837]  A long segment is coming up.
[02:27:28.837 --> 02:27:32.800]  But just quantify, how would you describe the world economy right now?
[02:27:35.194 --> 02:27:42.156]  Basically, we're collapsing and I don't think you'll see the dollar remain as a viable currency after 2028.
[02:27:42.156 --> 02:27:45.476]  Well, you talk about they're destabilizing things.
[02:27:45.476 --> 02:27:49.837]  Schwab brags they're destabilizing things on purpose to bring in what?
[02:27:49.837 --> 02:27:51.998]  But doesn't he know he's getting the blame now?
[02:27:51.998 --> 02:27:54.478]  He thinks he can do this collapse and not get the blame.
[02:27:54.478 --> 02:27:57.739]  Do you think things are going well for the WEF?
[02:27:57.739 --> 02:28:02.860]  No, look, I mean, Schwab, I can tell you that he is a control freak.
[02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:10.389]  This is why everything he is proposing is absolute control.
[02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:14.353]  Chips and people and all sorts of crazy ideas.
[02:28:14.353 --> 02:28:21.902]  He's an academic, and every academic I've ever encountered are Marxists.
[02:28:24.301 --> 02:28:30.803]  His view is Marxism would have succeeded had they also had Europe and the United States.
[02:28:30.803 --> 02:28:33.603]  So this is what they're pushing here.
[02:28:33.603 --> 02:28:35.544]  A one world government.
[02:28:35.544 --> 02:28:39.045]  They think the UN can basically then control everybody.
[02:28:39.045 --> 02:28:40.665]  I mean, it's going to fail.
[02:28:40.665 --> 02:28:43.386]  Our computer shows that it's going to absolutely fail.
[02:28:44.006 --> 02:28:44.487]  Absolutely.
[02:28:44.487 --> 02:28:51.014]  If he is an admitted Marxist, an ultra-rich Marxist, who believes we were all robots, then his utopia would work.
[02:28:51.014 --> 02:28:52.916]  Another bureaucrat control freak.
[02:28:52.916 --> 02:28:53.997]  Martin Armstrong is our guest.
[02:28:53.997 --> 02:28:54.378]  Stay with us.
[02:28:58.163 --> 02:29:00.644]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[02:29:00.644 --> 02:29:01.925]  Why is this taking so long?
[02:29:01.925 --> 02:29:05.406]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[02:29:05.406 --> 02:29:06.727]  Why can't we do this here?
[02:29:06.727 --> 02:29:09.208]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[02:29:09.208 --> 02:29:15.071]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[02:29:15.231 --> 02:29:17.051]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[02:29:17.051 --> 02:29:18.972]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[02:29:18.972 --> 02:29:20.892]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[02:29:20.892 --> 02:29:31.474]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[02:29:31.474 --> 02:29:35.615]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[02:29:35.615 --> 02:29:38.496]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[02:29:38.496 --> 02:29:40.676]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[02:29:40.936 --> 02:29:44.617]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[02:29:44.617 --> 02:29:47.958]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[02:29:47.958 --> 02:29:50.178]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[02:29:50.178 --> 02:29:55.440]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:58.501]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[02:29:58.501 --> 02:30:04.582]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:30:04.582 --> 02:30:07.683]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[02:30:08.797 --> 02:30:13.699]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:30:13.699 --> 02:30:17.221]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[02:30:17.221 --> 02:30:18.082]  It's game over.
[02:30:18.082 --> 02:30:23.785]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:30:23.785 --> 02:30:28.367]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:30:28.367 --> 02:30:34.530]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[02:30:35.010 --> 02:30:46.984]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsTore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[02:30:46.984 --> 02:30:53.111]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:53.111 --> 02:30:54.933]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[02:30:58.331 --> 02:31:06.876]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:31:06.876 --> 02:31:16.501]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[02:31:16.501 --> 02:31:18.182]  And that's the problem.
[02:31:18.182 --> 02:31:20.943]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:31:20.943 --> 02:31:23.705]  They illegally changed state elections.
[02:31:24.605 --> 02:31:30.148]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:31:30.148 --> 02:31:32.169]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:31:32.169 --> 02:31:36.430]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:31:36.430 --> 02:31:51.537]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[02:31:52.257 --> 02:31:55.019]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalists.
[02:32:04.759 --> 02:32:11.161]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[02:32:11.161 --> 02:32:16.302]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:32:16.302 --> 02:32:18.002]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:32:18.002 --> 02:32:24.424]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we have this success.
[02:32:25.144 --> 02:32:30.586]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[02:32:30.586 --> 02:32:34.728]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:32:34.728 --> 02:32:44.072]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:32:44.072 --> 02:32:45.473]  God bless you all.
[02:32:45.473 --> 02:32:46.533]  I salute you.
[02:32:46.533 --> 02:32:47.453]  I thank you.
[02:32:47.453 --> 02:32:52.976]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[02:32:53.656 --> 02:32:54.977]  The fight is my fight.
[02:32:54.977 --> 02:32:55.598]  It's your fight.
[02:32:55.598 --> 02:32:56.359]  It's our fight.
[02:32:56.359 --> 02:32:57.119]  God bless you all.
[02:33:15.591 --> 02:33:21.874]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:33:21.874 --> 02:33:30.317]  Martin Armstrong has been joining us for decades.
[02:33:30.317 --> 02:33:33.778]  He is probably the most accurate predictor of the future.
[02:33:33.778 --> 02:33:38.440]  He's giving you all the details and facts and background, but how does this break?
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.861]  I mean, what are the different scenarios?
[02:33:40.861 --> 02:33:41.922]  What should the public know?
[02:33:42.642 --> 02:33:47.404]  When we've got the head of the European Central Bank saying, we've lost power, everything's collapsing.
[02:33:47.404 --> 02:33:51.486]  You've got Schwab laughing, saying once it all collapses, they'll be able to reorder it.
[02:33:51.486 --> 02:33:53.086]  But he's getting the blame.
[02:33:53.086 --> 02:33:54.187]  He thought that wouldn't happen.
[02:33:54.187 --> 02:33:58.708]  He thought they would collapse things and then use the crisis to get control themselves.
[02:33:58.708 --> 02:33:59.949]  I don't see it going that way.
[02:33:59.949 --> 02:34:04.731]  So looking out over the horizon, short term, mid term, long term, what does Martin Armstrong see?
[02:34:06.981 --> 02:34:12.924]  Well, we see a tremendous rise in civil unrest globally next year.
[02:34:12.924 --> 02:34:19.647]  And it is, as I said, Schwab is an academic.
[02:34:19.647 --> 02:34:24.049]  He actually has a bust of Lenin on his bookshelf.
[02:34:24.049 --> 02:34:29.531]  You know, this is what he believes.
[02:34:29.531 --> 02:34:35.614]  And everybody that he has there is largely on that same agenda.
[02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:38.741]  It's not going to work.
[02:34:38.741 --> 02:34:50.364]  I mean, the primary reason that communism failed is because it attempted to make everybody just drones.
[02:34:50.364 --> 02:34:56.646]  I was called in by China to help them actually become capitalists.
[02:34:56.646 --> 02:34:59.587]  And it was a very interesting experience.
[02:34:59.587 --> 02:35:05.229]  I went there and effectively they, I had to explain
[02:35:06.526 --> 02:35:09.128]  Very fundamental economic principles.
[02:35:09.128 --> 02:35:14.991]  I mean, they wanted to know, like, why one tea was selling at a different price someplace else.
[02:35:14.991 --> 02:35:19.093]  And I said, first, you have transportation costs.
[02:35:19.093 --> 02:35:21.054]  And they were like, oh, wow, really?
[02:35:21.054 --> 02:35:26.197]  I said, then somebody will pay more for something that they prefer over another.
[02:35:27.071 --> 02:35:44.041]  So, you know, this is why communism fell, because basically if a tea was priced at $1 here and $1 all within the other side of the country, but it cost $10 to get it there, that's why communism collapsed.
[02:35:44.041 --> 02:35:48.524]  And you have these people like Schwab who just are
[02:35:49.913 --> 02:35:50.493]  I don't know.
[02:35:50.493 --> 02:35:55.577]  I mean, they're brain dead or what, but they keep trying.
[02:35:55.577 --> 02:35:58.319]  You make statements like you'll own nothing and like it.
[02:35:58.319 --> 02:36:01.080]  And exactly the point you make.
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:03.562]  Well, why is T20 dollars here and ten dollars here?
[02:36:03.562 --> 02:36:06.524]  Because the shipping costs and where it's got to go is more.
[02:36:06.524 --> 02:36:08.385]  They don't even understand basic things.
[02:36:08.385 --> 02:36:10.287]  It is the dumbest ideology.
[02:36:10.287 --> 02:36:13.549]  Why does it keep taking over then?
[02:36:13.549 --> 02:36:15.890]  Because, you know, I don't know.
[02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:16.771]  I mean, it's.
[02:36:18.283 --> 02:36:22.165]  Schwab and I have been on opposite sides for decades.
[02:36:22.165 --> 02:36:30.328]  I mean, Marcus Vetter came and did the movie on me, The Forecaster, and it was funded by a German TV station.
[02:36:30.328 --> 02:36:34.509]  Schwab then called him and said, hey, I want you to do a movie on us.
[02:36:34.509 --> 02:36:38.031]  So Marcus filmed, it's called The Forum, on
[02:36:39.326 --> 02:36:43.047]  I mean, whatever I've done, he then tries to copy.
[02:36:43.047 --> 02:36:48.069]  It's just, it has been a war for decades between us.
[02:36:48.069 --> 02:36:51.209]  We started our first World Economic Conference in 1985.
[02:36:51.209 --> 02:36:54.891]  He started his first World Economic Forum in 1987.
[02:36:54.891 --> 02:37:00.232]  It's just, you know, we're on opposite sides.
[02:37:00.232 --> 02:37:02.253]  I mean, Nigel Farage came to ours in 2019.
[02:37:03.954 --> 02:37:05.716]  And he said, of course I'm here.
[02:37:05.716 --> 02:37:11.281]  He says, you know, basically Armstrong is the alternative to Davos.
[02:37:11.281 --> 02:37:16.846]  I mean, this has been a longstanding war between the two of us for a long time.
[02:37:16.846 --> 02:37:18.927]  He's just an academic.
[02:37:18.927 --> 02:37:20.569]  Does he know how much trouble he's in?
[02:37:20.569 --> 02:37:23.311]  Because he's probably more hated than Bill Gates right now.
[02:37:23.311 --> 02:37:25.954]  I mean, he is hated as much as Hitler right now.
[02:37:27.645 --> 02:37:38.671]  Yeah, look, I mean, this is the problem and he has used his influence to buy time with these politicians.
[02:37:40.154 --> 02:37:42.576]  And most look at what we have out there.
[02:37:42.576 --> 02:37:51.081]  I mean, you've got Trudeau in Canada, you've got who they call, you know, Mrs. Head down in New Zealand.
[02:37:51.081 --> 02:37:58.045]  I mean, all these people, he's training them to stick them in there in these various different governments.
[02:37:58.045 --> 02:38:00.666]  It is horrible, absolutely horrible.
[02:38:00.666 --> 02:38:01.307]  But, uh,
[02:38:02.866 --> 02:38:07.250]  Not a, you know, it's a debate as to who is the worst world leader.
[02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:09.812]  I mean, look at Biden.
[02:38:09.812 --> 02:38:14.035]  He's senile and he just reads whatever the cue cards basically say.
[02:38:14.035 --> 02:38:19.139]  And it's who's, you know, the real president is who's writing the cue cards.
[02:38:19.139 --> 02:38:20.880]  So what should we look for next?
[02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:23.102]  Because you've been predicting major upheaval.
[02:38:23.102 --> 02:38:23.762]  It's now happening.
[02:38:23.762 --> 02:38:25.904]  What are you predicting comes next?
[02:38:25.904 --> 02:38:28.586]  Well, I think we're going to start seeing a lot of civil unrest.
[02:38:29.432 --> 02:38:38.176]  I mean, I mean, I think this is the longest time it has ever taken to even say who won an election.
[02:38:38.176 --> 02:38:44.758]  I mean, we've always known that night or maybe the day after, not a week later.
[02:38:44.758 --> 02:38:50.641]  My own staff could have wrote a program, you know, in less than 30 days that everybody can vote.
[02:38:50.641 --> 02:38:56.583]  I mean, if we can buy on Amazon safely, why can't we vote on a computer safely?
[02:38:56.583 --> 02:38:59.024]  What's with all these paper ballots all of a sudden?
[02:38:59.801 --> 02:39:07.326]  I mean, I know people in Canada that were getting ballots, mail-in ballots, and they're not even American.
[02:39:07.326 --> 02:39:16.792]  Pennsylvania got caught over, you know, sending out 200,000 mail-in ballots, and they weren't even verified as to if they were American or not.
[02:39:16.792 --> 02:39:17.653]  Let's switch gears.
[02:39:17.653 --> 02:39:21.175]  You've been really on the Ukraine crisis with Russia.
[02:39:21.175 --> 02:39:25.658]  This news, a false flag with a missile attempt, blew up in their face, pun intended.
[02:39:25.658 --> 02:39:26.879]  What do you see happening there?
[02:39:30.771 --> 02:39:33.634]  Ukraine, I know very well.
[02:39:33.634 --> 02:39:39.159]  We actually have had employees from Donetsk as well as from Kiev.
[02:39:39.159 --> 02:39:44.363]  And I can tell you that you can't even bring a Russian bottle of vodka to dinner in Kiev.
[02:39:44.363 --> 02:39:46.245]  It's an insult.
[02:39:46.245 --> 02:39:50.849]  It goes back very long time, the hatred in that area.
[02:39:50.849 --> 02:39:52.851]  There is no resolution.
[02:39:52.851 --> 02:39:53.571]  Zelensky is
[02:39:55.553 --> 02:39:57.574]  Nothing but propaganda, basically.
[02:39:57.574 --> 02:40:00.216]  I mean, he puts out all this stuff.
[02:40:00.216 --> 02:40:11.326]  Adelaide University has just come out and confirmed that vast majority of all these pro-Ukrainian comments all over the place are
[02:40:12.246 --> 02:40:13.166]  We're good to go.
[02:40:41.969 --> 02:40:53.124]  This whole thing, I mean, you know, he's refusing to keep saying that it's all nothing but, oh, it's Russia, Russia, Russia.
[02:40:53.124 --> 02:40:57.509]  And he wants to get, you know, he's trying desperately to create World War III.
[02:40:58.504 --> 02:41:00.545]  I mean, he's a very dangerous man.
[02:41:00.545 --> 02:41:04.487]  And it's unbelievable.
[02:41:04.487 --> 02:41:08.209]  But, you know, we should not be supporting Ukraine whatsoever.
[02:41:08.209 --> 02:41:10.750]  I agree with Henry Kissinger.
[02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:11.491]  Don't ask.
[02:41:14.012 --> 02:41:22.916]  Historically Russian territory and I'm talking about back to the days of the Tsar and that's why you have Russian people living there.
[02:41:32.671 --> 02:41:43.727]  All I can hope for is that the West wakes up and knocks off this insane proxy war, which is basically what it is.
[02:41:46.112 --> 02:41:57.017]  But unfortunately, I think we're going into World War Three and it's probably going to hit after or in 2025 going into maybe 27.
[02:41:57.017 --> 02:42:01.839]  And because we do the same thing with Taiwan.
[02:42:01.839 --> 02:42:08.001]  You sent Pelosi over there just before the Communist Convention.
[02:42:08.001 --> 02:42:10.783]  I mean, that's like, yes, you better give, you know,
[02:42:13.261 --> 02:42:17.930]  I mean, why would you do that just ahead of that?
[02:42:17.930 --> 02:42:19.633]  Of course that supported him.
[02:42:20.994 --> 02:42:31.742]  You know, I don't know who's making these decisions in Washington, but they seem to be intentionally trying to make the world far worse rather than better.
[02:42:31.742 --> 02:42:32.242]  Exactly.
[02:42:32.242 --> 02:42:32.763]  Stay there.
[02:42:32.763 --> 02:42:33.884]  Stay there.
[02:42:33.884 --> 02:42:35.905]  Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com.
[02:42:35.905 --> 02:42:38.828]  I want you to cover any other big topics you want.
[02:42:38.828 --> 02:42:42.050]  I've got a lot of questions, but you're smarter than I am about economics, what's happening.
[02:42:42.050 --> 02:42:45.913]  What is your advice to the American people, people of the world, about the time and place we're in right now?
[02:42:45.913 --> 02:42:46.694]  Final segment.
[02:42:47.074 --> 02:42:50.456]  Our special guest, Mr. Armstrong, then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:42:50.456 --> 02:42:58.441]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:58.441 --> 02:43:00.903]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[02:43:00.903 --> 02:43:02.184]  Why is this taking so long?
[02:43:02.184 --> 02:43:05.666]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[02:43:05.666 --> 02:43:06.947]  Why can't we do this here?
[02:43:06.947 --> 02:43:09.488]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[02:43:09.488 --> 02:43:15.352]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[02:43:15.492 --> 02:43:17.313]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[02:43:17.313 --> 02:43:19.214]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[02:43:19.214 --> 02:43:21.156]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[02:43:21.156 --> 02:43:31.743]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[02:43:31.743 --> 02:43:35.886]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[02:43:35.886 --> 02:43:38.767]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[02:43:38.767 --> 02:43:40.949]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[02:43:41.189 --> 02:43:44.873]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[02:43:44.873 --> 02:43:48.217]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[02:43:48.217 --> 02:43:50.439]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[02:43:50.439 --> 02:43:55.725]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[02:43:55.725 --> 02:43:58.768]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[02:43:58.768 --> 02:43:59.729]  By the will of God.
[02:44:00.976 --> 02:44:10.425]  And by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent media.
[02:44:10.425 --> 02:44:12.046]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[02:44:12.046 --> 02:44:19.273]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[02:44:19.733 --> 02:44:24.196]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[02:44:24.196 --> 02:44:25.457]  And I need your support.
[02:44:25.457 --> 02:44:33.083]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:44:34.924 --> 02:44:41.768]  And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL that gives him go for direct Alex Jones Legal Defense Fund.
[02:44:41.768 --> 02:44:46.310]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[02:44:46.310 --> 02:44:50.532]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[02:44:50.532 --> 02:44:58.676]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[02:44:58.676 --> 02:45:00.157]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[02:45:00.897 --> 02:45:04.899]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[02:45:04.899 --> 02:45:05.839]  There's a solution.
[02:45:05.839 --> 02:45:07.220]  The Wellness Company.
[02:45:07.220 --> 02:45:17.724]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer, and I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[02:45:17.984 --> 02:45:44.061]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[02:45:45.041 --> 02:45:45.282]  Thank you.
[02:45:58.271 --> 02:46:09.759]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:14.222]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:46:14.222 --> 02:46:18.185]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:46:18.185 --> 02:46:22.628]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:46:22.628 --> 02:46:23.689]  You see, the sun
[02:46:24.409 --> 02:46:24.889]  We're good to go!
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:49.101]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:18.846 --> 02:47:22.188]  The plot to seize Russia.
[02:47:22.188 --> 02:47:23.308]  The top economist.
[02:47:23.308 --> 02:47:25.089]  I mean, I've been following this stuff for 30 years.
[02:47:25.089 --> 02:47:25.729]  Had him on for 20.
[02:47:25.729 --> 02:47:28.190]  Only a couple times here, should get him on more often.
[02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:29.191]  He's hard to get on.
[02:47:29.191 --> 02:47:31.132]  Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com.
[02:47:32.179 --> 02:47:39.665]  During the break I said, Mr. Armstrong, condense all your predictions and warnings into this segment and can we stop World War III?
[02:47:39.665 --> 02:47:41.427]  And he said, probably not.
[02:47:41.427 --> 02:47:42.548]  They need it.
[02:47:42.548 --> 02:47:45.350]  The globalists need it as a smoke screen for the Great Reset.
[02:47:45.350 --> 02:47:51.375]  So, sir, give us that knowledge and talk about your new book and where this is all going.
[02:47:51.375 --> 02:47:57.641]  Well, their theory is to create a new Brenton Woods.
[02:47:58.690 --> 02:48:03.193]  And to get out of all the debt, they will default on it.
[02:48:03.193 --> 02:48:07.416]  And that's why Schwab is saying, you'll own nothing and be happy.
[02:48:07.416 --> 02:48:11.700]  He's trying to make it sound that you're the one in trouble, not them.
[02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:16.283]  And that they will relieve you of all your debts.
[02:48:16.283 --> 02:48:19.165]  And they're being generous and helping you.
[02:48:19.165 --> 02:48:22.367]  When in fact, it's their debts that they're going to default on.
[02:48:22.367 --> 02:48:24.789]  But that wipes out all the pension funds.
[02:48:24.789 --> 02:48:25.930]  Social Security is 100% U.S.
[02:48:25.930 --> 02:48:26.490]  government debt.
[02:48:28.689 --> 02:48:41.041]  And so they think that using the war, that that will be the justification to create another Bretton Woods after World War II.
[02:48:41.041 --> 02:48:44.044]  And then they get to re-establish everything.
[02:48:44.044 --> 02:48:51.051]  And for 40 years in governments that I've been talking to, their view is that they are not the problem, we are.
[02:48:51.787 --> 02:48:59.432]  And that if you found a $100 bill on the parking lot, you cheated them out of their $50, you know, their share.
[02:48:59.432 --> 02:49:06.217]  It's, you know, they never consider anything whatsoever about, you know, themselves.
[02:49:06.217 --> 02:49:09.299]  As I've said, there's no mirrors in Washington.
[02:49:09.299 --> 02:49:11.260]  So it's always about us.
[02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:14.282]  And we do not comply with what they want to do.
[02:49:14.282 --> 02:49:16.424]  And that's why they want the digital currencies.
[02:49:17.367 --> 02:49:20.289]  Because if I gave you $100, that's fine.
[02:49:20.289 --> 02:49:22.210]  They don't know where I got it from.
[02:49:22.210 --> 02:49:28.715]  But if it's a digital currency, they know where I even got it from and can follow it all the way down the line.
[02:49:28.715 --> 02:49:36.740]  So I mean, this is all getting to be, you know, very draconian, but I mean, this is their objective.
[02:49:37.575 --> 02:49:40.956]  And that's what Schwab is really saying with the Great Reset.
[02:49:40.956 --> 02:49:49.499]  And he has sold this idea to governments as a whole as their way to escape from the debt crisis.
[02:49:49.499 --> 02:49:52.300]  And it's just going to be a complete mess.
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:56.281]  And then he thinks he can recreate things.
[02:49:56.281 --> 02:49:58.182]  And you can't.
[02:49:58.182 --> 02:50:04.504]  I mean, the reason we became the biggest in the world was because we did foreign exchange.
[02:50:05.290 --> 02:50:05.691]  All right.
[02:50:05.691 --> 02:50:08.614]  We were the first ever to do anything like that.
[02:50:08.614 --> 02:50:18.745]  And when we were going to open an office in 1985, I had lunch with one of the top bankers in Switzerland.
[02:50:18.745 --> 02:50:23.751]  And I had a list of foreign names, European advisors, whatever.
[02:50:23.751 --> 02:50:25.653]  And he said, name one
[02:50:26.833 --> 02:50:29.995]  European analysts, and I was embarrassed because I couldn't.
[02:50:29.995 --> 02:50:32.236]  And he said, there are none.
[02:50:32.236 --> 02:50:41.102]  Because after World War Two, every politician used the rise in the currency from zero as proof that he did a good job.
[02:50:41.102 --> 02:50:45.725]  So no bank analysts would ever come out and say, oh, the Deutsche Mark is going to go down.
[02:50:45.725 --> 02:50:47.926]  That was, you know, political.
[02:50:47.926 --> 02:50:52.589]  So we became the biggest and he says, because you don't care if the dollar goes up or down.
[02:50:52.589 --> 02:50:54.050]  I said, it's just a trade to me.
[02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:54.590]  That's it.
[02:50:56.098 --> 02:50:58.319]  So that's how we became so big.
[02:50:58.319 --> 02:51:04.843]  It was just simply our, you know, foreign exchange was our, you know, our real forte.
[02:51:04.843 --> 02:51:10.487]  And you have to understand that that's why all the governments called us in for this, that, the other thing.
[02:51:10.487 --> 02:51:17.592]  I mean, it was, you know, I got called in for the, for creating the G5 back in 85, the 87 crash.
[02:51:17.592 --> 02:51:20.633]  You know, they, I was friends with Margaret Thatcher.
[02:51:20.633 --> 02:51:22.555]  She kept pounding out of the Euro.
[02:51:23.562 --> 02:51:27.424]  When they tried to get it in, that blew up and Soros became famous.
[02:51:27.424 --> 02:51:35.989]  I mean, all these things I've been in the middle of, and it's always been foreign exchange has been the primary issue.
[02:51:35.989 --> 02:51:38.750]  And when they were creating the euro, they came to us.
[02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:42.092]  I told them if they don't consolidate the debts, it's going to collapse.
[02:51:42.984 --> 02:51:46.727]  And they said, look, we just have to get the euro in first, and we'll worry about the next thing.
[02:51:46.727 --> 02:51:49.249]  And now they admit, so what's the first to collapse?
[02:51:49.249 --> 02:51:50.050]  Is it the euro?
[02:51:50.050 --> 02:51:50.710]  Is it China?
[02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:52.192]  Because the ruble's way up.
[02:51:52.192 --> 02:51:55.034]  I mean, what's the most, is it the dollar?
[02:51:55.034 --> 02:51:56.195]  I mean, how do you see this?
[02:51:56.195 --> 02:52:02.960]  I know it's hard to make a prediction, but... The dollar's the last to fall, because it's going to be like World War I and II.
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:04.922]  All the money comes here.
[02:52:04.922 --> 02:52:05.242]  All right?
[02:52:05.242 --> 02:52:09.786]  Because Europe's, you know, you got tanks going down the streets, blowing up things.
[02:52:09.786 --> 02:52:12.408]  That's what the strength in the dollar has been.
[02:52:13.554 --> 02:52:16.775]  It's been capital inflows, a U.S.
[02:52:16.775 --> 02:52:18.676]  share market as well.
[02:52:18.676 --> 02:52:23.098]  I mean, pay attention to the Dow versus, for example, the Nasdaq.
[02:52:23.098 --> 02:52:25.119]  Nasdaq is retail domestic.
[02:52:25.119 --> 02:52:29.641]  The Dow is the big money from international.
[02:52:29.641 --> 02:52:37.384]  It's like when the Japanese came over buying real estate, you know, what do they, they bought all the trophies, you know, Rockefeller Center, et cetera.
[02:52:37.384 --> 02:52:40.145]  They don't buy mom and pop houses down the street from you.
[02:52:41.408 --> 02:52:46.071]  So it's, you know, the Dow represents big international capital.
[02:52:46.071 --> 02:52:52.354]  And first you have the concentration of capital into the United States from Europe and Asia.
[02:52:52.354 --> 02:53:00.039]  And then eventually, you know, as all these countries start defaulting on their debt, they're going to turn and say, well, the U.S.
[02:53:00.039 --> 02:53:01.820]  has got to be next.
[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:02.440]  So the U.S.
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:03.881]  will be the last to fall.
[02:53:05.148 --> 02:53:19.493]  And that's why they got Biden in there, because he'll sign basically anything that... And as you said, they're getting ready for the Euro to be the first big one to drop, but they want a big bailout with their Marshall Fund 2.0.
[02:53:21.625 --> 02:53:22.846]  Pretty much, yes.
[02:53:22.846 --> 02:53:31.653]  I mean, you have Zelensky over there who's telling, he got Biden mad, he's basically saying he wants the U.S.
[02:53:31.653 --> 02:53:33.895]  to cover all their pensions.
[02:53:33.895 --> 02:53:35.937]  We don't even cover ours.
[02:53:35.937 --> 02:53:41.521]  I mean, it's, you know, the whole thing is falling apart.
[02:53:41.521 --> 02:53:44.524]  How does FTX going belly up tie to this?
[02:53:47.054 --> 02:53:53.636]  They, you know, they were basically funding, they were the second largest donator to the Democrats.
[02:53:53.636 --> 02:53:58.717]  He was basically funding the fake studies for COVID.
[02:53:58.717 --> 02:54:07.359]  And, you know, he just bought his way into the Democrats and thinking that he could, you know, buy protection.
[02:54:07.359 --> 02:54:13.000]  But, you know, they lost so much with the collapse in digital currencies that
[02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:15.901]  You know, it's, you know, there it goes.
[02:54:15.901 --> 02:54:21.322]  I mean, and you're getting a contagion now in other areas.
[02:54:21.322 --> 02:54:29.464]  So the good old fashioned things is basically, you know, cash, some medals, things of that nature, and you keep them in your drawer for right now.
[02:54:29.464 --> 02:54:31.585]  But U.S.
[02:54:31.585 --> 02:54:36.746]  dollars, I should point out that 70% of the dollars circulate outside the country.
[02:54:37.335 --> 02:54:38.096]  Because the U.S.
[02:54:38.096 --> 02:54:43.780]  has been the only country that doesn't cancel its currency, whereas Britain cancels it.
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:46.283]  You have a 10-pound note from 20 years ago.
[02:54:46.283 --> 02:54:47.744]  They're worthless.
[02:54:47.744 --> 02:54:49.385]  The same thing in Europe.
[02:54:49.385 --> 02:54:52.047]  I mean, they cancel currencies routinely.
[02:54:52.047 --> 02:54:58.453]  Canada passed a law and he canceled all the high currencies in January.
[02:54:58.453 --> 02:55:01.235]  So this is, you know, the U.S.
[02:55:01.235 --> 02:55:04.478]  is, the dollar has been the reserve currency.
[02:55:05.629 --> 02:55:09.633]  And it's also been used primarily outside the country.
[02:55:09.633 --> 02:55:12.515]  I mean, dollars are circulating tremendously in Russia.
[02:55:12.515 --> 02:55:23.224]  So in closing, and I really appreciate your time, other big predictions, politically in America, the war in Russia, just quick synopses if you can.
[02:55:23.224 --> 02:55:26.427]  Well, you know, this is an election that nobody's going to accept.
[02:55:28.275 --> 02:55:36.202]  Our computer warned that it was probably the most corrupt election, I think, in American history.
[02:55:36.202 --> 02:55:40.926]  But it really calls into question what's going to happen in 2024.
[02:55:40.926 --> 02:55:48.572]  And I'm not necessarily sure we're even going to have a viable election at that point.
[02:55:50.319 --> 02:55:57.986]  Like Stalin said, you know, anybody can vote whoever they want, but it's those that count are the ones that decide the election.
[02:55:57.986 --> 02:56:00.929]  And, you know, he wasn't so far off.
[02:56:00.929 --> 02:56:05.894]  You know, you have to understand that we're probably still in a very steep recession.
[02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:10.672]  Interest rates are still going to rise into next year.
[02:56:10.672 --> 02:56:13.695]  So you're looking at mortgage rates going up.
[02:56:13.695 --> 02:56:16.858]  I wouldn't pay off mortgages if you have them at low rates.
[02:56:16.858 --> 02:56:22.002]  I would, you know, basically keep it because that's the risk you've sold to somebody else.
[02:56:22.002 --> 02:56:32.692]  And I would definitely make sure you have a supply of some food because the supply chain has been really seriously disrupted.
[02:56:35.049 --> 02:56:47.282]  Energy, I mean, you should have at least some sort of a backup if possible, because these people are trying to shut down the entire power grids, really, with what they're doing.
[02:56:47.282 --> 02:56:48.603]  And they don't even understand.
[02:56:48.603 --> 02:56:53.589]  I mean, you had Biden, as soon as he came in, the first thing he did was cut off the pipeline from Canada.
[02:56:54.755 --> 02:57:02.399]  Then he outlaws all drilling, yet then he goes over to Saudi Arabia before the election, and please don't cut off anything before the election.
[02:57:02.399 --> 02:57:05.401]  We don't care what you do afterwards.
[02:57:05.401 --> 02:57:08.282]  But, you know, these people are completely insane.
[02:57:08.282 --> 02:57:19.188]  If everybody had electric cars, the power grid, the most conservative estimate I've ever seen, it has to be 400 times larger than what it is now.
[02:57:20.249 --> 02:57:21.730]  Incredibly, incredibly said.
[02:57:21.730 --> 02:57:30.137]  I know you've got to go, but if you could do five more minutes, a two-minute break, I just want you to continue what you're doing now, because I want you to just lay it out, because they are insane.
[02:57:30.137 --> 02:57:31.718]  They're collapsing things.
[02:57:31.718 --> 02:57:34.861]  They admit they want to post it to the rest of the world, but they're going to get the blame.
[02:57:34.861 --> 02:57:39.044]  How do we stop them from completely collapsing things, and then get new leadership and stop this?
[02:57:39.044 --> 02:57:41.106]  Because that's the big question.
[02:57:41.106 --> 02:57:42.467]  Five more minutes with us, Mr. Armstrong.
[02:57:42.467 --> 02:57:43.528]  We'll come right back to you.

[02:58:40.944 --> 02:58:43.325]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[02:58:43.325 --> 02:58:46.327]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[02:58:47.270 --> 02:58:55.797]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:58:55.797 --> 02:59:05.444]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[02:59:05.444 --> 02:59:07.105]  And that's the problem.
[02:59:07.105 --> 02:59:09.868]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:59:09.868 --> 02:59:12.650]  They illegally changed state elections.
[02:59:13.530 --> 02:59:19.072]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:59:19.072 --> 02:59:21.093]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:59:21.093 --> 02:59:25.354]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:59:25.354 --> 02:59:40.459]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[02:59:41.219 --> 02:59:43.321]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:59:43.321 --> 02:59:48.946]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[02:59:48.946 --> 03:00:02.937]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.937 --> 03:00:06.801]  The plot to seize Russia.
[03:00:06.801 --> 03:00:08.142]  We have the author on with us.
[03:00:09.730 --> 03:00:12.533]  Well, basically, I was in the middle of all this stuff, but in order to do the book
[03:00:29.140 --> 03:00:44.414]  I've got a hold of all the declassified documents from the Clinton administration, which effectively I've used throughout the whole book, giving you even the letters, transcripts from phone calls of Yeltsin to Clinton.
[03:00:46.045 --> 03:00:51.210]  Everything they've been saying about Russia and Putin is just basically all a lie.
[03:00:51.210 --> 03:00:58.717]  And what was shocking, even to me, was that when USSR failed in 1991, NATO went to Russia and said, okay, fine, you can join.
[03:01:06.460 --> 03:01:17.929]  And that's why there was a coup against Gorbachev, because the communists there saw that as a surrender of Russia to the United States.
[03:01:17.929 --> 03:01:22.713]  So I think we can probably maybe do another show on that one.
[03:01:22.713 --> 03:01:32.861]  But what I wanted to say before, you know, we shut down is that we're not going to be able to stop these people from basically destroying the world.
[03:01:33.735 --> 03:01:39.720]  But what will happen is that we're looking at separatist movements again.
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:40.741]  So you're looking at
[03:01:41.832 --> 03:01:44.093]  The United States is separating.
[03:01:44.093 --> 03:01:46.954]  This is like the fall of Rome.
[03:01:46.954 --> 03:01:49.896]  And you're going to see Europe separating.
[03:01:49.896 --> 03:01:54.898]  You're already seeing countries, you know, disputing, you know, each other.
[03:01:54.898 --> 03:01:56.919]  And one policy doesn't fit all.
[03:01:56.919 --> 03:01:59.560]  The centralized government fails.
[03:01:59.560 --> 03:02:03.422]  That's why, you know, the USSR, you know, collapsed.
[03:02:03.422 --> 03:02:07.624]  The United States is so polarized politically.
[03:02:08.388 --> 03:02:15.452]  That we're not going to be able to survive as an entire country anymore.
[03:02:15.452 --> 03:02:18.853]  Civilization is created when everybody benefits.
[03:02:18.853 --> 03:02:33.761]  You can't stand up and start calling them names, your deplorables, and it has become so polarized in the country that you've destroyed the very foundation of the United States.
[03:02:36.517 --> 03:02:37.857]  The same thing with Putin.
[03:02:37.857 --> 03:02:39.458]  I mean, they they're out there.
[03:02:39.458 --> 03:02:40.538]  Oh, he's a war criminal.
[03:02:40.538 --> 03:02:44.719]  He says, how do you then negotiate even peace?
[03:02:44.719 --> 03:02:48.200]  I mean, you know, you're you're insulting the head of the state.
[03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:50.101]  He's not even going to the G20.
[03:02:50.101 --> 03:02:55.142]  I can tell you that I have people inside the ICC.
[03:02:55.142 --> 03:02:57.423]  We were very upset.
[03:02:57.423 --> 03:03:00.484]  And the International Criminal Court, they want to indict him.
[03:03:00.484 --> 03:03:02.965]  They've never indicted a head of state.
[03:03:04.634 --> 03:03:06.316]  Uh, for, you know, war crimes.
[03:03:06.316 --> 03:03:07.397]  I mean, this is absurd.
[03:03:07.397 --> 03:03:08.859]  It's all political.
[03:03:08.859 --> 03:03:13.164]  But once you do that, there is no negotiation.
[03:03:13.164 --> 03:03:15.326]  You're not coming back from this.
[03:03:15.326 --> 03:03:20.252]  So, I mean, you're... And they just tried to missile false flags that blew up in their face.
[03:03:21.235 --> 03:03:25.557]  Yeah, I mean, look, this is, this is, you know, we're in the endgame here.
[03:03:25.557 --> 03:03:27.058]  They're desperate.
[03:03:27.058 --> 03:03:34.222]  They're trying to create World War Three to distract us from the default on the sovereign debt default.
[03:03:34.222 --> 03:03:36.583]  I mean, it doesn't work anymore.
[03:03:36.583 --> 03:03:41.426]  This is what, you know, what's collapsing in front of our eyes.
[03:03:41.426 --> 03:03:44.567]  And it's been fiscal mismanagement since World War Two.
[03:03:47.142 --> 03:03:53.946]  You know, and people have to realize that they look at us as basically stupid.
[03:03:53.946 --> 03:03:58.529]  I was in Australia and they were passing the luxury tax.
[03:03:58.529 --> 03:04:06.454]  And the slogan was, we're going to get all those basic rich people who have their French wines, their fur coats and their Ferraris.
[03:04:07.313 --> 03:04:08.334]  And everybody cheered.
[03:04:08.334 --> 03:04:09.235]  Yeah, go get them.
[03:04:09.235 --> 03:04:10.096]  And what was in it?
[03:04:10.096 --> 03:04:11.838]  All electrical products.
[03:04:11.838 --> 03:04:18.044]  You bought a radio, a phone, a radio... It was a tax on the working class.
[03:04:18.044 --> 03:04:23.049]  Yeah, I mean, it's always that way because there aren't that many people.
[03:04:23.049 --> 03:04:25.812]  I mean, it... There aren't a lot of rich people.
[03:04:25.812 --> 03:04:27.314]  All these taxes are on poor people.
[03:04:28.396 --> 03:04:30.376]  Yeah, that's basically what happens.
[03:04:30.376 --> 03:04:41.019]  I mean, there's only 600 and some odd, you know, billionaires in the country, but you need 87,000, you know, armed IRS agents.
[03:04:41.019 --> 03:04:41.459]  All right.
[03:04:41.459 --> 03:04:42.779]  Martin Armstrong, powerful.
[03:04:42.779 --> 03:04:45.320]  You name the time to a full hour on your book on Russia.
[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:46.540]  We really appreciate you.
[03:04:46.540 --> 03:04:48.180]  Armstrong at Economics.com.
[03:04:48.180 --> 03:04:50.101]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:04:50.101 --> 03:04:51.761]  Well, thank you for inviting me.
[03:04:51.761 --> 03:04:53.462]  I'm going to introduce Paul Joseph Watson straight ahead.
[03:04:53.462 --> 03:04:54.122]  Amazing interview.
[03:04:54.122 --> 03:04:54.742]  Thank you, Martin.
[03:04:57.478 --> 03:04:59.700]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:04:59.700 --> 03:05:03.722]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[03:05:03.722 --> 03:05:05.043]  There's a solution.
[03:05:05.043 --> 03:05:06.024]  The Wellness Company.
[03:05:06.024 --> 03:05:09.326]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:05:09.326 --> 03:05:25.858]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online
[03:05:26.338 --> 03:05:26.999]  We're good to go.
[03:06:02.911 --> 03:06:08.774]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:08.774 --> 03:06:12.777]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom is about to take over.
[03:06:12.777 --> 03:06:18.260]  Then in about 55 minutes, Owen Schroer in the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:06:18.260 --> 03:06:19.781]  Central.
[03:06:19.781 --> 03:06:22.882]  What a powerful interview today with Matt Baker and Martin Armstrong.
[03:06:22.882 --> 03:06:24.443]  Two incredible interviews.

[03:09:17.946 --> 03:09:18.286]  And now,
[03:09:19.428 --> 03:09:24.878]  For the balance of the hour, from the United Kingdom, Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[03:09:44.346 --> 03:09:53.945]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:09:56.437 --> 03:09:56.937]  You're live!
[03:09:56.937 --> 03:09:59.219]  It is the Summit News Hour.
[03:09:59.219 --> 03:10:04.083]  A raft of news coming up over the course of the next 50 or so minutes.
[03:10:04.083 --> 03:10:05.564]  We've got new updates.
[03:10:05.564 --> 03:10:15.792]  The fallout from the missile strike blamed on Russia that of course Ukraine and Zelensky immediately came out and tried to escalate into World War 3.
[03:10:15.792 --> 03:10:21.216]  When in fact it was Ukraine all along that had fired the missile and they knew from the very start that it was them.
[03:10:22.705 --> 03:10:26.609]  Zolanski, of course, doubling down and still claiming that it wasn't Ukraine.
[03:10:26.609 --> 03:10:32.494]  Well, he's finally been forced to slink away with his tail between his legs.
[03:10:32.494 --> 03:10:39.541]  We're also going to tell you what some idiot at an auction in New York paid over 41 million dollars for.
[03:10:41.013 --> 03:10:45.817]  Suffice to say, you know, people going through an inflation hell cost of living crisis.
[03:10:45.817 --> 03:10:49.160]  These elitists live in a different world.
[03:10:49.160 --> 03:11:00.571]  I'm going to tell you how the authorities in the United Kingdom are blaming excess deaths, which have of course nothing to do whatsoever with the Covid vaccine, on global warming.
[03:11:01.832 --> 03:11:08.636]  But first, I want to get into the migrant crisis, because of course, as you know, by now I talk about it every single time I host this show.
[03:11:08.636 --> 03:11:15.799]  Over 40,000 illegal boat migrants, the majority of whom aren't coming from countries that are at war.
[03:11:15.799 --> 03:11:18.160]  Four out of ten of them are from Albania.
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:28.225]  The vast majority, young, fighting-age males, they get on a boat from France, they get a taxi service by the UK border force.
[03:11:28.225 --> 03:11:29.086]  Illegal immigrants,
[03:11:29.850 --> 03:11:39.978]  They get on a coach, they get given free cash, they get given free healthcare, when it's virtually impossible to get an appointment during winter with the NHS.
[03:11:39.978 --> 03:11:42.539]  Because it's the envy of the world, apparently.
[03:11:42.539 --> 03:11:49.705]  If you're an illegal immigrant coming on a boat from France, free healthcare, and of course, free hotel accommodation!
[03:11:49.705 --> 03:11:55.249]  Now it started with rinky-dink crappy hotels on the edge of basically S-hole towns,
[03:11:55.951 --> 03:11:58.973]  Then it moved up to four-star accommodation.
[03:11:58.973 --> 03:12:08.198]  Then it moved up to hotels located in prime tourist areas in the middle of towns, giving out free hotel rooms to these legals.
[03:12:08.198 --> 03:12:16.343]  Now they're putting them, or planning to put them, on luxury cruise ships and in five-star hotels.
[03:12:16.343 --> 03:12:19.865]  And these are the problems that are generated by that in the UK.
[03:12:20.839 --> 03:12:22.940]  Headliner of Remix News.
[03:12:22.940 --> 03:12:30.722]  Asylum seeker accused of rape in UK has gone missing after being moved from one migrant hotel to another.
[03:12:30.722 --> 03:12:31.682]  Whoops!
[03:12:31.682 --> 03:12:32.082]  Poof!
[03:12:32.082 --> 03:12:33.603]  He's vanished into thin air.
[03:12:33.603 --> 03:12:39.324]  An asylum seeker who was subject to police bail conditions after being accused of rape.
[03:12:39.324 --> 03:12:42.265]  He raped a boy, by the way.
[03:12:42.265 --> 03:12:45.986]  Bringing his wondrous culture over from his home country.
[03:12:47.037 --> 03:12:53.141]  ...has gone missing after UK authorities failed to securely transfer him from one hotel to another.
[03:12:53.141 --> 03:13:00.206]  This was the 39-year-old suspect who was staying at an asylum centre in London.
[03:13:00.206 --> 03:13:05.330]  An attack took place on October 5th, during which he raped a young boy.
[03:13:05.330 --> 03:13:10.013]  Then, of course, the opposition's shadow Labour MP, Diane Abbott, came out and basically said
[03:13:11.152 --> 03:13:17.558]  The reason he raped the young boy in an asylum centre in London was because people on the right were being mean to migrants.
[03:13:17.558 --> 03:13:20.141]  That was the true culprit of it all.
[03:13:20.141 --> 03:13:24.986]  Well now, after he was transferred to another hotel accommodation in Buckingham, about 125 kilometres away,
[03:13:27.392 --> 03:13:32.375]  The suspect should have been escorted by police to the new hotel, but he wasn't.
[03:13:32.375 --> 03:13:34.197]  He was just told to go there on his own.
[03:13:34.197 --> 03:13:38.459]  A literal rapist set to go to trial.
[03:13:38.459 --> 03:13:40.281]  Now his whereabouts are unknown.
[03:13:40.281 --> 03:13:41.161]  He's gone missing.
[03:13:41.161 --> 03:13:43.122]  No one knows where he is.
[03:13:43.122 --> 03:13:46.785]  Of course, almost every day now on the south coast of England.
[03:13:48.658 --> 03:13:50.439]  Dover and those areas.
[03:13:50.439 --> 03:13:52.921]  We have illegal boat migrants arriving on dinghies.
[03:13:52.921 --> 03:14:11.196]  There are so many coming now that the border force, the charity leftists, refugees, welcome NGOs, can't even rescue them all, can't even intercept them all, and in many cases they just rock up on the shores, get off their dinghies, and run off into the local town.
[03:14:11.196 --> 03:14:12.457]  No one knows who they are.
[03:14:12.457 --> 03:14:13.278]  They could be anyone.
[03:14:13.278 --> 03:14:14.198]  They could be rapists.
[03:14:14.198 --> 03:14:15.059]  They could be criminals.
[03:14:15.059 --> 03:14:16.020]  They could be terrorists.
[03:14:17.156 --> 03:14:33.579]  We recall, of course, before the Paris Massacre and afterwards, the ISIS jihadists that carried out the Paris Massacre bragging in their own publications, we were able to slip into Europe on fake Syrian passports by pretending to be refugees.
[03:14:33.579 --> 03:14:34.639]  This could be happening.
[03:14:34.639 --> 03:14:42.180]  The next massacre could be being planned right now as a result of these people coming in because our border is completely porous.
[03:14:42.180 --> 03:14:44.741]  It's like Swiss cheese.
[03:14:44.741 --> 03:14:46.381]  Now we have rapists going missing.
[03:14:47.341 --> 03:14:59.325]  We have locals in the towns where they come ashore arming themselves with weapons now, whatever weapons they can get their hands on, because in some cases these migrants have broken into their homes.
[03:14:59.325 --> 03:15:02.085]  That doesn't seem to phase refugees welcome activists though.
[03:15:02.085 --> 03:15:04.866]  We have this headline again out of Remix News.
[03:15:04.866 --> 03:15:08.808]  UK refugee charity calls for ban on naming migrant hotels.
[03:15:08.808 --> 03:15:13.469]  Yes, the real problem isn't the migrants themselves hanging around in one case,
[03:15:14.281 --> 03:15:18.344]  A high school in Standish near Wigan filming the P.E.
[03:15:18.344 --> 03:15:24.209]  lessons sexually harassing 12-year-old girls as they walk home from school.
[03:15:24.209 --> 03:15:30.194]  Another migrant in that hotel raping a 37-year-old woman on the street at night.
[03:15:30.194 --> 03:15:31.775]  No, that's not the problem.
[03:15:31.775 --> 03:15:38.180]  The problem is the British public knowing the name of the hotel where these migrants are being held.
[03:15:38.180 --> 03:15:40.302]  Now, the Refugee Council in the UK
[03:15:41.002 --> 03:15:47.271]  ...has called on the government not to disclose the names of those hotels to the general public, citing safety concerns.
[03:15:47.271 --> 03:15:50.395]  So that's the bigger safety concern, not naming the hotels.
[03:15:50.395 --> 03:15:53.039]  Forget about the rapes, forget about the rampant criminality.
[03:15:53.039 --> 03:15:54.681]  Summit.News will be back.
[03:15:57.028 --> 03:15:58.589]  Look around you.
[03:15:58.589 --> 03:16:03.591]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[03:16:03.591 --> 03:16:07.492]  Infowars credibility, my credibility, has never been higher.
[03:16:07.492 --> 03:16:16.836]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[03:16:16.836 --> 03:16:22.478]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[03:16:22.478 --> 03:16:26.080]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:30.042]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[03:16:30.042 --> 03:16:36.327]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[03:16:36.327 --> 03:16:37.608]  It's unsustainable.
[03:16:37.608 --> 03:16:41.911]  So please, visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[03:16:41.911 --> 03:16:50.036]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[03:16:50.036 --> 03:16:53.038]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[03:16:53.038 --> 03:16:54.339]  Thank you for your support.
[03:16:54.339 --> 03:16:55.440]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[03:16:56.741 --> 03:17:05.287]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[03:17:05.287 --> 03:17:14.913]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[03:17:14.913 --> 03:17:16.594]  And that's the problem.
[03:17:16.594 --> 03:17:19.356]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[03:17:19.356 --> 03:17:22.118]  They illegally changed state elections.
[03:17:23.018 --> 03:17:28.560]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:30.580]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[03:17:30.580 --> 03:17:34.821]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:17:34.821 --> 03:17:49.945]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[03:17:51.106 --> 03:17:52.810]  Shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:17:52.810 --> 03:17:54.192]  We're not election deniers.
[03:17:54.192 --> 03:17:56.857]  We're election realists.
[03:17:56.857 --> 03:18:02.827]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company.
[03:18:04.099 --> 03:18:14.487]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[03:18:14.487 --> 03:18:27.238]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[03:18:27.918 --> 03:18:28.678]  We're good to go.
[03:18:57.083 --> 03:19:03.175]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[03:19:03.175 --> 03:19:06.300]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[03:19:07.381 --> 03:19:12.283]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[03:19:12.283 --> 03:19:15.824]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[03:19:15.824 --> 03:19:16.664]  It's game over.
[03:19:16.664 --> 03:19:22.366]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[03:19:22.366 --> 03:19:26.968]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[03:19:26.968 --> 03:19:33.110]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[03:19:33.610 --> 03:19:45.578]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsTore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[03:19:45.578 --> 03:19:51.702]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:51.702 --> 03:19:53.503]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[03:19:57.651 --> 03:20:15.726]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:15.726 --> 03:20:20.771]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:24.924 --> 03:20:29.488]  Now again, I've said it before, I don't really blame these migrants for wanting to come here.
[03:20:29.488 --> 03:20:36.734]  They come from, in many cases, backwards countries rife with criminality, poverty and violence.
[03:20:36.734 --> 03:20:41.078]  But again, the problem is, all of them coming here bar a few.
[03:20:41.078 --> 03:20:52.408]  And the media always, for example, there was a newspaper front cover a couple of weeks ago where they found the one child staying at this migrant processing centre and of course that ends up on the front page.
[03:20:53.183 --> 03:21:03.666]  In fact, the photographers tell you, if you go down to these asylum centres, they could take pictures all day of these fighting-age young men coming into these facilities.
[03:21:03.666 --> 03:21:12.168]  There's no point, because the newspapers don't want to buy those photos of those overwhelmingly 98% young men coming into these facilities.
[03:21:12.168 --> 03:21:17.390]  They want the one photo of the mother and child, and that's what they put on the front cover.
[03:21:17.390 --> 03:21:22.251]  Which is why the British public has a completely skewed perception of all of this.
[03:21:23.399 --> 03:21:36.669]  But again, you get these men, 70, 80, sometimes 150, moving into a migrant centre, sometimes in small villages comprised of less than a thousand population.
[03:21:36.669 --> 03:21:39.672]  And they don't do anything, they just hang around the streets all day.
[03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:42.361]  And it causes problems.
[03:21:42.361 --> 03:21:45.724]  Loitering, harassment, criminality.
[03:21:45.724 --> 03:22:05.940]  And of course if you live in a certain area, and you've known a certain life, for generations in some cases, if you suddenly get 150 young men from Afghanistan, Iran, Albania, moving into a facility around the corner from where you live, that's going to change your village!
[03:22:05.940 --> 03:22:07.801]  It's going to change your town!
[03:22:07.801 --> 03:22:09.763]  It's going to make the streets more dangerous!
[03:22:10.493 --> 03:22:19.319]  In Kilkenny in Ireland, they had a population of 10,000 and 3,000 migrants moved in.
[03:22:19.319 --> 03:22:23.322]  It was plus almost a third in a matter of months.
[03:22:23.322 --> 03:22:27.906]  Now they're complaining to the local newspaper about not feeling safe on the streets.
[03:22:27.906 --> 03:22:30.447]  It happens everywhere.
[03:22:30.447 --> 03:22:38.173]  And this Refugee Council has got the gall to say, make it illegal to name the hotels in which these migrants are being housed.
[03:22:38.846 --> 03:22:48.235]  Because one nutcase in Dover threw a petrol bomb at the outside of a building, didn't kill anyone, didn't hurt anyone, ended up killing himself.
[03:22:48.235 --> 03:22:49.957]  He was mentally ill.
[03:22:49.957 --> 03:22:54.481]  The police came out and said it had nothing to do with political extremism.
[03:22:54.481 --> 03:22:58.345]  But now we can't even know the names of the hotels!
[03:22:58.345 --> 03:23:01.788]  Well, in one case, the hotel owner is refusing the government
[03:23:02.819 --> 03:23:14.286]  The government's offering him a million pounds to have his hotel full of asylum seekers 100% occupancy for at least 12 months.
[03:23:14.286 --> 03:23:20.370]  Bear in mind many of these hotels are on the verge of going out of business because lockdown almost ruined them.
[03:23:20.370 --> 03:23:24.653]  So many of them have to take the money from the government and they get 100% occupancy for 12 months.
[03:23:26.843 --> 03:23:36.329]  There's barely any occupancy at the moment in November, where it's pissing down with rain every day and four degrees Celsius in England.
[03:23:36.329 --> 03:23:38.450]  So why not take the government money?
[03:23:38.450 --> 03:23:43.093]  Well, to his credit, one hotelier in the UK has rejected the offer.
[03:23:43.093 --> 03:23:49.157]  Hotelier refuses one million offer from Home Office to house asylum seekers.
[03:23:49.157 --> 03:23:53.440]  This is Richard Martin, who owns the three-star blazing Donkey Country Hotel in Sandwich, Kent.
[03:23:54.406 --> 03:23:57.688]  He's been offered a million again for 100% occupancy.
[03:23:57.688 --> 03:24:00.630]  He said he couldn't think of anything more absurd.
[03:24:00.630 --> 03:24:04.492]  We spent 30 years building up the business but money doesn't come into it.
[03:24:04.492 --> 03:24:08.254]  He says our reputation would shatter overnight.
[03:24:08.254 --> 03:24:09.275]  And why is that?
[03:24:09.275 --> 03:24:15.358]  Because in some cases they've had migrants stay in these hotels with tourists staying in the same hotels at the same time.
[03:24:15.358 --> 03:24:18.760]  TripAdvisorBucket.com review score plummets.
[03:24:18.760 --> 03:24:23.403]  And of course they get a bad reputation from the local community because this causes crime and violence.
[03:24:24.167 --> 03:24:32.651]  I'm gonna come back to talk more about this, but let's hit this first video first because apparently there's a solution to all this from Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister.
[03:24:32.651 --> 03:24:34.732]  Not really a solution, more of a band-aid.
[03:24:34.732 --> 03:24:36.754]  This is called That Ain't It, Chief.
[03:24:36.754 --> 03:24:37.354]  Let's roll it.
[03:24:37.981 --> 03:24:54.047]  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has unveiled his miraculous solution to the boat migrant crisis, with almost a thousand illegal migrants arriving on British shores every single day, and them being given a free taxi service on shore, free cash, free high-end hotel accommodation and free healthcare.
[03:24:54.047 --> 03:24:57.968]  More migrants arrived today on this boat and just ran off into the local town.
[03:24:58.348 --> 03:25:00.289]  Rishi says he has the answer!
[03:25:00.289 --> 03:25:07.513]  Paying France £63 million so they can increase the number of police officers patrolling beaches in France?
[03:25:07.513 --> 03:25:08.173]  Er, no.
[03:25:08.173 --> 03:25:09.133]  That ain't it, Chief.
[03:25:09.133 --> 03:25:12.475]  We already paid them £54 million last year.
[03:25:12.475 --> 03:25:13.575]  What did that achieve?
[03:25:13.575 --> 03:25:17.617]  What's throwing an extra £7 million at the problem really gonna accomplish?
[03:25:17.617 --> 03:25:20.639]  I mean, yeah, it may stop a few hundred more crossings per day.
[03:25:20.759 --> 03:25:23.561]  But they're still gonna be coming at almost the same rate!
[03:25:23.561 --> 03:25:25.983]  That isn't a solution, it's a band-aid!
[03:25:25.983 --> 03:25:27.845]  Ripped off at a moment's notice.
[03:25:27.845 --> 03:25:34.070]  What motivation does France have for keeping sometimes dangerous, illegal migrants in their country?
[03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:40.995]  They already have massive problems on their own soil caused by runaway mass migration, so why would they want to exacerbate that?
[03:25:40.995 --> 03:25:44.779]  And given that this is what they were confronted with at Dunkirk over the weekend...
[03:25:52.216 --> 03:25:56.661]  Are French police really motivated to have to deal with these individuals?
[03:25:56.661 --> 03:26:02.327]  Or are they more likely to just let them sail off to jolly old England and have us deal with them instead?
[03:26:02.327 --> 03:26:07.272]  France is already demanding Italy accept boatloads of migrants that arrive on Italian territory.
[03:26:07.532 --> 03:26:08.753]  On French ships!
[03:26:08.753 --> 03:26:12.375]  Relying on them to stop boats coming to England is a fool's errand.
[03:26:12.375 --> 03:26:26.664]  The only way to stop the boats from coming is to disincentivise the journeys in the first place by getting out of the European Court of Human Rights and then replacing it with a British Bill of Rights that actually gives us control over our own borders.
[03:26:26.824 --> 03:26:32.866]  Without leaving a loophole to be exploited by malevolent NGOs and human rights campaigners.
[03:26:32.866 --> 03:26:35.447]  Then follow Australia's example.
[03:26:35.447 --> 03:26:40.988]  They held asylum seekers on neutral territory and then processed their claims at a snail's pace.
[03:26:40.988 --> 03:26:41.969]  Result?
[03:26:41.969 --> 03:26:48.571]  Legions of economic migrants who knew they couldn't get immediate access to the country didn't even bother trying.
[03:26:48.571 --> 03:26:51.392]  There's no migrant crisis affecting Australia now.
[03:26:51.392 --> 03:26:52.152]  They solved it.
[03:26:52.532 --> 03:26:54.414]  So let's copy their methods.
[03:26:54.414 --> 03:27:00.021]  Paying the French to ensure our border security is like paying criminals to guard other prisoners.
[03:27:00.021 --> 03:27:02.844]  They're just gonna take the money and let the prisoners out anyway.
[03:27:02.844 --> 03:27:07.209]  And do you really believe that Rishi Sunak is that bothered about mass migration?
[03:27:07.449 --> 03:27:13.135]  He's already planning to introduce a new growth visa which will ensure millions more will arrive anyway.
[03:27:13.135 --> 03:27:19.541]  If that scheme's introduced it'll probably end up making the numbers arriving in boats look like a trickle compared to a deluge.
[03:27:19.541 --> 03:27:24.226]  The Tories have already proven themselves completely untrustworthy when it comes to immigration.
[03:27:24.226 --> 03:27:29.831]  That's why polls show a new party led by Nigel Farage could attract over a quarter of UK voters.
[03:27:30.852 --> 03:27:37.737]  68% of Conservative voters would seriously consider switching their allegiance to a new Farage-led party.
[03:27:37.737 --> 03:27:42.620]  62% said they want, and quote, someone to stand up for ordinary British people.
[03:27:42.620 --> 03:27:48.764]  And as the past decade plus has taught us, that sure as hell isn't gonna be the Conservative Party.
[03:27:51.132 --> 03:28:01.578]  So yeah, we're going to pay France, what, 7 million more than we did last year and apparently that's going to stop these waves of boats because the French really want them in their own country, don't they?
[03:28:01.578 --> 03:28:06.201]  Rejected asylum seeker attacks and injures two French border officers.
[03:28:06.201 --> 03:28:13.365]  A Nigerian national who had been refused asylum in France was arrested on Wednesday for an attack on Border Force agents that left two police officers injured.
[03:28:13.365 --> 03:28:16.727]  They want more of those people on French soil, don't they?
[03:28:16.727 --> 03:28:18.728]  No, they're just going to keep sending them over to us.
[03:28:20.589 --> 03:28:26.275]  Meanwhile, UK to dump migrants in rural areas as bids to fix channel crisis fail.
[03:28:26.275 --> 03:28:37.806]  So basically all the lefty, virtue-signalling, Lib Dem, refugees welcome activists in 98% white countryside areas of England, which is, you know, where I live by the way.
[03:28:39.105 --> 03:28:42.009]  They're now gonna get the diversity they voted for.
[03:28:42.009 --> 03:28:45.934]  No longer will it be concentrated in the major towns and cities.
[03:28:45.934 --> 03:28:53.144]  The multiculturalism and all the benefits of it is gonna spread out into the rural areas and they'll get what they voted for.
[03:28:53.144 --> 03:28:53.624]  We'll be back.
[03:28:53.624 --> 03:28:54.165]  Summit.News.
[03:28:54.165 --> 03:28:54.606]  Don't go away.
[03:28:56.852 --> 03:29:08.342]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[03:29:08.342 --> 03:29:12.786]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:29:12.786 --> 03:29:16.749]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[03:29:16.749 --> 03:29:21.193]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:29:21.193 --> 03:29:22.274]  You see, the sun
[03:29:22.954 --> 03:29:23.294]  I think so.

[03:29:56.807 --> 03:30:08.118]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:30:08.118 --> 03:30:10.020]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:30:10.020 --> 03:30:11.462]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:30:11.462 --> 03:30:12.983]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:30:12.983 --> 03:30:14.685]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:30:14.685 --> 03:30:15.986]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:30:15.986 --> 03:30:17.368]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:30:17.788 --> 03:30:22.634]  I studied the Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:30:22.634 --> 03:30:25.017]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:30:25.017 --> 03:30:27.039]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:30:27.039 --> 03:30:33.987]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the Globalist agenda.
[03:30:34.628 --> 03:30:40.010]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:30:40.010 --> 03:30:48.952]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:30:48.952 --> 03:30:56.775]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[03:30:56.775 --> 03:31:01.336]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[03:31:02.856 --> 03:31:11.984]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[03:31:11.984 --> 03:31:16.368]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[03:31:16.368 --> 03:31:22.073]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[03:31:22.073 --> 03:31:23.574]  And our main tool is free speech.
[03:31:24.195 --> 03:31:24.635]  We're good to go.
[03:32:00.580 --> 03:32:04.921]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[03:32:04.921 --> 03:32:16.125]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:32:17.065 --> 03:32:28.679]  Number one most hate enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[03:32:28.679 --> 03:32:31.882]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are
[03:32:32.483 --> 03:32:33.084]  We're good to go.
[03:32:57.648 --> 03:33:03.554]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:26.812 --> 03:33:35.478]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:35.478 --> 03:33:50.548]  Of course, on Tuesday we had the insane, maniacal, feverish escalation into potential World War III territory, when a supposedly stray missile hit Poland
[03:33:51.371 --> 03:34:00.457]  President Zelensky came out within mere minutes, blaming Russia, with no evidence whatsoever, calling on NATO to act.
[03:34:00.457 --> 03:34:04.880]  Basically calling for a massive escalation, a potential no-fly zone.
[03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:09.903]  Of course, within hours, it was revealed that the missile was actually Ukrainian.
[03:34:09.903 --> 03:34:14.066]  Polish politician blames Ukraine for missile provocation.
[03:34:14.066 --> 03:34:19.009]  This is a former councilman in the area where the missile struck.
[03:34:19.887 --> 03:34:27.730]  He said Ukraine caused a provocation by falsely claiming its own missile was in fact fired by Russia.
[03:34:27.730 --> 03:34:34.193]  Of course they came out afterwards, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, NATO heads, and said, doesn't matter, it's Russia's fault anyway.
[03:34:34.193 --> 03:34:40.255]  Ukraine could literally launch nuclear missiles into Warsaw and they blame Russia.
[03:34:40.255 --> 03:34:44.237]  But Jaroslaw Pakula, this Polish councilman,
[03:34:44.818 --> 03:34:47.800]  We've previously shown staunch support for Ukraine.
[03:34:47.800 --> 03:34:50.583]  He had a Ukraine flag in his Facebook bio.
[03:34:50.583 --> 03:34:53.265]  He was all signed up for the cause.
[03:34:53.265 --> 03:34:58.829]  Got really angry at this and said it was time for Poland to change its entire outlook on the war.
[03:34:58.829 --> 03:35:08.457]  He said the missile accident showed Warsaw needed to send a blunt message to Kiev, or KEEV, rather than telling its own citizens, quote, fairy tales.
[03:35:08.457 --> 03:35:14.262]  Said of course this is a Ukrainian rocket, of course this is a provocation on the part of the Ukrainian authorities.
[03:35:15.464 --> 03:35:19.712]  And I'm gonna get into Zelensky's doubling down in the aftermath of this on the other side.
[03:35:19.712 --> 03:35:22.296]  But first, let's set the scene with this video.
[03:35:22.296 --> 03:35:24.901]  This is called Sheer Madness.
[03:35:24.901 --> 03:35:25.502]  Let's roll it.
[03:35:26.158 --> 03:35:32.839]  You'd think that with a potential escalation into World War 3 on the line, world leaders would be a bit more cautious.
[03:35:32.839 --> 03:35:33.900]  Not Zelensky.
[03:35:33.900 --> 03:35:38.941]  Mere moments after a missile landed in Poland, the Ukrainian president said this.
[03:35:38.941 --> 03:35:41.241]  Terror is not limited to our national borders.
[03:35:41.241 --> 03:35:45.582]  Russian missiles hit Poland to fire missiles at NATO territory.
[03:35:45.582 --> 03:35:48.803]  This is a Russian missile attack on collective security.
[03:35:48.803 --> 03:35:51.083]  This is a very significant escalation.
[03:35:51.083 --> 03:35:52.424]  We must act.
[03:35:52.424 --> 03:35:53.024]  Fact check.
[03:35:53.504 --> 03:35:54.084]  Wrong!
[03:35:54.084 --> 03:35:56.345]  Turns out the missiles were fired by Ukraine.
[03:35:56.345 --> 03:36:01.108]  Missile that struck Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces, evidence suggests.
[03:36:01.108 --> 03:36:01.348]  U.S.
[03:36:01.348 --> 03:36:06.310]  officials say it appears the weapon was launched by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian rocket.
[03:36:06.310 --> 03:36:06.650]  Oh!
[03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:13.073]  Only the most naive idiot would believe Zelensky didn't know the incident in Poland wasn't a Russian attack.
[03:36:13.073 --> 03:36:16.194]  It in fact was an air defense missile fired by Ukraine.
[03:36:16.194 --> 03:36:21.797]  Yet he went public immediately to blame Russia and to call on NATO to take action.
[03:36:21.957 --> 03:36:23.618]  Is there going to be any consequences for that?
[03:36:23.618 --> 03:36:29.080]  Any backlash to knowingly trying to escalate a potential world war on a phony pretext?
[03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:31.482]  Are we all supposed to just forget about it and move on?
[03:36:31.482 --> 03:36:35.864]  Even Biden came out relatively quickly and said it didn't look like a Russian attack.
[03:36:35.864 --> 03:36:36.344]  It's unlikely.
[03:36:37.165 --> 03:36:40.886]  In the minds of the trajectory, that it was fired from Russia.
[03:36:40.886 --> 03:36:47.869]  But of course, only after he asked Congress to approve another 37 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine, all the timing was impeccable.
[03:36:47.869 --> 03:36:58.592]  Of course, it was US officials who originally leaked the information about the missile hitting Poland, despite the fact that NATO had already tracked the missile on radar, so they knew it didn't come from Russia.
[03:36:58.592 --> 03:37:02.173]  The components of the missile also clearly indicated it was Ukrainian.
[03:37:02.173 --> 03:37:06.695]  Yet it was the narrative for hours yesterday that the evil Russians had done it.
[03:37:06.915 --> 03:37:09.716]  Look at these British newspapers from this morning.
[03:37:09.716 --> 03:37:12.777]  Tyrants war on Ukraine, Russian bombs hit Poland.
[03:37:12.777 --> 03:37:15.718]  Putin's war escalates, Russian missiles hit Poland.
[03:37:15.718 --> 03:37:18.979]  No waiting even for a cursory investigation.
[03:37:18.979 --> 03:37:22.660]  Just run with the most feverish propaganda possible.
[03:37:22.660 --> 03:37:24.061]  Sheer madness.
[03:37:24.261 --> 03:37:32.626]  You don't have to be a Kremlin stooge to realise that such baseless provocations are absolute insanity, given what's on the line.
[03:37:32.626 --> 03:37:39.190]  But British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says it doesn't matter that Ukraine fired the missile, Russia's still to blame anyway.
[03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:40.111]  Oh well, who cares?
[03:37:40.111 --> 03:37:45.154]  Let's just shut up, keep sending them billions more, and keep waving our little flags.
[03:37:45.154 --> 03:37:48.636]  With behaviour like this, I'm sure everything's gonna be just fine.
[03:37:51.269 --> 03:38:00.574]  So again, Zelensky came out within minutes, said this is a terrorist attack by Russia, this is a dangerous escalation, NATO needs to act.
[03:38:00.574 --> 03:38:09.298]  And then even after Biden, NATO, Rishi Sunak, Trudeau, all of them came out and basically said no, this wasn't Russia, this was Ukraine.
[03:38:09.298 --> 03:38:13.980]  The next day, Zelensky still won't back down.
[03:38:13.980 --> 03:38:19.123]  Headline out of Information Liberation, Zelensky insists missile that struck Poland was Russian,
[03:38:19.952 --> 03:38:34.276]  Despite NATO, Poland and US all fingering Ukraine, he came out and demanded an investigation, and for Ukraine to be at the forefront of that investigation, still claiming that it had nothing to do with Ukraine.
[03:38:34.276 --> 03:38:43.838]  Again, the irony of him demanding a proper investigation, when within minutes, with no investigation whatsoever, and based on the claims of anonymous US officials,
[03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:46.971]  He said it was Russian with no evidence.
[03:38:46.971 --> 03:38:48.853]  Now he wants an investigation.
[03:38:48.853 --> 03:38:50.614]  That was yesterday.
[03:38:50.614 --> 03:39:01.901]  And it took until today, two days later, for Zelensky to finally start to climb down and backtrack from this narrative.
[03:39:01.901 --> 03:39:06.463]  Zelensky backtracks after urging NATO action for Polish border blasts, reports Zero Hedge.
[03:39:06.463 --> 03:39:11.487]  He said, as of Thursday, Zelensky says he's not sure about what happened.
[03:39:11.487 --> 03:39:13.648]  No, first it was, oh my God, this is Russia.
[03:39:14.716 --> 03:39:17.619]  Then it was, well, it's probably Russia, we need an investigation.
[03:39:17.619 --> 03:39:19.240]  Now it's, oh, I don't know what happened.
[03:39:19.240 --> 03:39:20.721]  And then everyone moves on.
[03:39:20.721 --> 03:39:21.943]  No, you don't get away with that.
[03:39:21.943 --> 03:39:25.085]  You literally tried to escalate it into World War III.
[03:39:25.085 --> 03:39:27.287]  Into NATO attacking Russia.
[03:39:27.287 --> 03:39:27.928]  Oh, sorry.
[03:39:27.928 --> 03:39:29.710]  Whoops, my bad.
[03:39:29.710 --> 03:39:30.851]  Absolute madness.
[03:39:32.461 --> 03:39:36.423]  He said, I don't know 100%, I think the world also doesn't 100% know what happened.
[03:39:36.423 --> 03:39:38.384]  Yeah, we know exactly what happened.
[03:39:38.384 --> 03:39:41.126]  You knew that it was not Russian.
[03:39:41.126 --> 03:39:52.753]  In fact, Ukrainian military officials told the US, this was reported by CNN earlier, they admitted it, that they knew it wasn't Russian immediately.
[03:39:52.753 --> 03:39:54.774]  They knew it was their own air defence missile.
[03:39:56.505 --> 03:40:03.169]  You also had NATO in lifetime on radar tracking the missile and where it came from.
[03:40:03.169 --> 03:40:06.792]  They all knew it wasn't Russian immediately.
[03:40:06.792 --> 03:40:14.757]  And yet it took him two days later merely to get to the point where he says we can't say specifically that this was the air defence of Ukraine.
[03:40:14.757 --> 03:40:18.459]  He's still not admitting it.
[03:40:18.459 --> 03:40:19.840]  Absolute insanity.

[03:40:23.326 --> 03:40:29.130]  AP issues correction to lie that Russian missiles struck Poland, admits Ukraine most likely culprit.
[03:40:29.130 --> 03:40:30.731]  Oh, thanks.
[03:40:30.731 --> 03:40:31.011]  Again.
[03:40:31.011 --> 03:40:37.995]  They fine Alex Jones $50,000,000,000,000 for something he said.
[03:40:37.995 --> 03:40:46.621]  The AP can come out and escalate into World War III, potentially, based on one anonymous US intelligence official.
[03:40:46.621 --> 03:40:50.443]  They get to put out a retraction a couple of days later and say, sorry, whoops, we got that wrong.
[03:40:51.494 --> 03:40:53.976]  Almost World War 3, total nuclear annihilation.
[03:40:53.976 --> 03:40:55.957]  Whoops, sorry!
[03:40:55.957 --> 03:41:02.041]  The Associated Press on Wednesday issued a correction to their false report that blamed Russia for striking Poland.
[03:41:02.041 --> 03:41:13.489]  It says, based on information from senior American intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, Russian missiles had crossed into Poland and killed two people.
[03:41:13.489 --> 03:41:15.731]  That's what they reported.
[03:41:15.731 --> 03:41:17.192]  Subsequent reporting?
[03:41:17.992 --> 03:41:23.235]  Showed that the missiles were Russian made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack.
[03:41:23.235 --> 03:41:23.775]  Oh, thanks.
[03:41:23.775 --> 03:41:24.516]  Two days later.
[03:41:24.516 --> 03:41:35.722]  And as Chris Menehan points out in this article, the AP broke their own rules on reporting to amplify this regime nuclear propaganda.
[03:41:35.722 --> 03:41:38.204]  Nuclear annihilation causing propaganda.
[03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:52.912]  Says, under AP's rules, material from anonymous sources may only be used if the material's information not opinion or speculation, which is precisely what this was, and it was proven wrong within hours.
[03:41:52.912 --> 03:41:59.234]  But again, they just issue a retraction, one sentence, everyone moves on to the next escalation.
[03:42:00.393 --> 03:42:05.557]  Oh, Russia's bombed a Holocaust memorial in Ukraine, in Kiev.
[03:42:05.557 --> 03:42:06.758]  Total BS!
[03:42:06.758 --> 03:42:08.239]  Totally made up.
[03:42:08.239 --> 03:42:10.440]  Jewish journalists visited it the next day.
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:11.881]  It wasn't touched.
[03:42:11.881 --> 03:42:14.683]  Completely unscathed.
[03:42:14.683 --> 03:42:15.684]  Snake Island.
[03:42:15.684 --> 03:42:19.166]  Russia's massacred Ukrainian troops on Snake Island.
[03:42:19.166 --> 03:42:19.807]  BS!
[03:42:19.807 --> 03:42:20.487]  Never happened.
[03:42:20.487 --> 03:42:23.409]  They surrendered.
[03:42:23.409 --> 03:42:24.270]  What was the other one?
[03:42:24.270 --> 03:42:28.093]  Mobile gassing vans from a 2013 YouTube video.
[03:42:31.244 --> 03:42:35.147]  Embarrassing cringe video of Justin and Rishi fawning on phone to Zelensky.
[03:42:35.147 --> 03:42:36.509]  Have you seen this clip?
[03:42:36.509 --> 03:42:38.550]  Talk about cringe.
[03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:39.551]  They're on the phone to him.
[03:42:39.551 --> 03:42:40.812]  You can't even see Zelensky.
[03:42:40.812 --> 03:42:45.336]  They're like, oh, we're so sorry about what happened to you yesterday.
[03:42:45.336 --> 03:42:45.576]  What?
[03:42:45.576 --> 03:42:49.620]  Their own missile got shot off in the wrong direction and killed two Polish people.
[03:42:49.620 --> 03:42:52.642]  Yeah, real tragedy for Ukraine, isn't it?
[03:42:52.642 --> 03:42:54.104]  Summit.News.
[03:42:54.104 --> 03:42:54.544]  We'll be back.
[03:42:56.439 --> 03:42:58.521]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:42:58.521 --> 03:42:59.802]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:42:59.802 --> 03:43:03.287]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:43:03.287 --> 03:43:04.608]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:43:04.608 --> 03:43:07.111]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:43:07.111 --> 03:43:12.958]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[03:43:13.118 --> 03:43:14.939]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:43:14.939 --> 03:43:16.840]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:43:16.840 --> 03:43:18.762]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[03:43:18.762 --> 03:43:29.348]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[03:43:29.348 --> 03:43:33.091]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:43:33.491 --> 03:43:36.392]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:43:36.392 --> 03:43:38.813]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[03:43:38.813 --> 03:43:42.494]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:43:42.494 --> 03:43:45.835]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:43:45.835 --> 03:43:48.055]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[03:43:48.055 --> 03:43:53.337]  This alternative media that we worked so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[03:43:53.337 --> 03:43:56.258]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[03:43:56.258 --> 03:44:02.960]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible,
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:07.424]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[03:44:07.424 --> 03:44:17.455]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible.
[03:44:17.455 --> 03:44:19.377]  It made any resistance to it possible.
[03:44:19.677 --> 03:44:30.500]  ...was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[03:44:30.500 --> 03:44:45.785]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air, and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:44:45.885 --> 03:44:47.307]  So continue to do it.
[03:44:47.307 --> 03:44:49.510]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:51.614]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[03:44:51.614 --> 03:44:56.561]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:45:01.107 --> 03:45:05.449]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[03:45:05.449 --> 03:45:16.654]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:45:17.594 --> 03:45:29.362]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is Infowars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[03:45:29.362 --> 03:45:36.207]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.

[03:46:39.816 --> 03:46:48.023]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.
[03:46:48.023 --> 03:46:56.210]  Come see The Wellness Company and go to onlinehealthnow.com as a conduit to The Wellness Company.
[03:46:57.737 --> 03:47:02.359]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.359 --> 03:47:08.922]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:08.922 --> 03:47:14.344]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:17.694 --> 03:47:22.537]  We still have three videos and I want to get to them all in this final segment.
[03:47:22.537 --> 03:47:27.860]  First though, remember it is the mega blowout sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:27.860 --> 03:47:30.142]  60% off on some of your favorite products.
[03:47:30.142 --> 03:47:31.463]  These are in limited supply.
[03:47:31.463 --> 03:47:33.144]  Many of them sold out.
[03:47:33.144 --> 03:47:35.805]  We still have Brain Force Plus in stock though at 60% off.
[03:47:37.063 --> 03:47:39.205]  Knockout Sleep Support, 50% off.

[03:47:56.736 --> 03:48:00.659]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:48:00.659 --> 03:48:04.361]  Now, of course, the cost of lockdown continues to hit the United Kingdom.
[03:48:04.361 --> 03:48:04.982]  Today we had
[03:48:05.862 --> 03:48:09.905]  A new tax levy imposed on the British public.
[03:48:09.905 --> 03:48:18.650]  Headline out of Breitbart, UK PM Sunak, Chancellor Hunt have declared war on workers with tax hike budgets, says Nigel Farage.
[03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:30.398]  The billions and billions spent on furlough, paying people to sit on their arses at home and do nothing during the entirety of lockdown, which many people now continue to abuse, by the way.
[03:48:30.398 --> 03:48:31.799]  We also had a report the other day
[03:48:33.487 --> 03:48:37.308]  20% of children are still missing from school, even now.
[03:48:37.308 --> 03:48:46.633]  One-fifth of all school children aren't going to school because their parents are so panicked by the fear-mongering, they refuse to let them go to school.
[03:48:46.633 --> 03:48:51.535]  That of course has massive negative impacts on their education, on their future.
[03:48:51.535 --> 03:48:57.698]  But the real cost of lockdown in terms of our pocketbooks is being felt with these massive tax hikes to pay for all this.
[03:48:58.749 --> 03:49:11.374]  Another cost of lockdown is the continuing phenomenon of excess non-Covid deaths, which have been running at alarming highs in the United Kingdom for about nine months now.
[03:49:11.374 --> 03:49:13.515]  Again, these are excess deaths.
[03:49:13.515 --> 03:49:14.575]  Unknown causes.
[03:49:14.575 --> 03:49:15.916]  What a mystery.
[03:49:15.916 --> 03:49:17.716]  Not Covid.
[03:49:17.716 --> 03:49:24.939]  Daily Skeptic reports UK HSA Chief Jenny Harris attempts to blame excess deaths on climate change.
[03:49:25.655 --> 03:49:34.078]  Yeah, we had a few hot days, you see, back in August, and that's why everyone's dropping dead mysteriously, suddenly dying out of nowhere.
[03:49:34.078 --> 03:49:37.419]  Nothing to do with the vaccine, of course.
[03:49:37.419 --> 03:49:46.683]  On the subject of climate change, though, let's go to this video now, because the father of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson got up on GB News
[03:49:47.426 --> 03:49:56.390]  He was talking about the sacrifices that we all had to make in pursuit of the hysteria that is man-made climate change, and he let slip a very revealing truth.
[03:49:56.390 --> 03:49:59.632]  This is called, he said the quiet part out loud.
[03:49:59.632 --> 03:50:00.032]  Here it is.
[03:50:00.032 --> 03:50:04.574]  I think Stanley Johnson just let slip something he should have kept to himself.
[03:50:04.574 --> 03:50:10.517]  During an appearance on GB News, the father of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this.
[03:50:10.517 --> 03:50:13.779]  So it actually means that countries need to divvy up
[03:50:14.259 --> 03:50:14.700]  Excuse me?
[03:50:14.700 --> 03:50:14.800]  What?
[03:50:35.883 --> 03:50:38.144]  Old Stanley just said the quiet part out loud.
[03:50:38.144 --> 03:50:39.105]  You can't go on a plane.
[03:50:39.105 --> 03:50:41.006]  That's part of the national plan.
[03:50:41.006 --> 03:50:46.689]  So it's part of the national plan in preventing climate change and pursuing the net zero agenda.
[03:50:46.689 --> 03:50:50.511]  To stop people from being able to fly on aeroplanes?
[03:50:50.511 --> 03:50:52.832]  Stanley, you weren't supposed to say that bit!
[03:50:53.012 --> 03:50:53.933]  You can't go on a plane.
[03:50:53.933 --> 03:50:55.694]  Talk about a mask-off moment.
[03:50:55.694 --> 03:50:59.036]  Yet another brazen admission about what all this is really about.
[03:50:59.036 --> 03:51:03.919]  Crushing your standards of living and paving the way for de facto climate lockdowns.
[03:51:03.919 --> 03:51:07.461]  Remember, this guy is a poster child for Extinction Rebellion.
[03:51:07.461 --> 03:51:10.423]  For Just Stop Oil, the XR rebrand.
[03:51:10.423 --> 03:51:14.345]  A billionaire-funded movement of privileged upper-middle-class narcissists.
[03:51:14.485 --> 03:51:19.931]  Who have been causing chaos and mayhem for ordinary working class people by blocking roads for weeks.
[03:51:19.931 --> 03:51:23.576]  And chasing social media clout by attacking precious works of art.
[03:51:25.001 --> 03:51:28.303]  Before subjecting us to their posh public hissy fits.
[03:51:28.303 --> 03:51:32.025]  Are you all concerned about the protection of a painting?
[03:51:32.025 --> 03:51:45.213]  Major banks are already creating carbon footprint calculators, which many fear are eventually intended to be rolled into a climate social credit score system, which would block payments for things like flights if you've exceeded your
[03:51:45.333 --> 03:51:47.574]  Carbon allowance for that month.
[03:51:47.574 --> 03:51:48.495]  Computer says no.
[03:51:48.495 --> 03:51:53.437]  Of course, such restrictions won't be applied to multi-millionaire Stanley Johnson and his cronies.
[03:51:53.437 --> 03:51:56.419]  The type who use private jets like you'd use a taxi.
[03:51:56.419 --> 03:52:00.821]  Because they can afford to buy carbon credits, which allow them to bypass it all!
[03:52:00.821 --> 03:52:06.324]  And then they're all heavily invested in the carbon trading mechanism anyway, so it's a win-win for them.
[03:52:06.324 --> 03:52:08.265]  Your annual family holiday, though?
[03:52:08.265 --> 03:52:13.187]  Well, we just did a temperature measurement on the tarmac at Heathrow Airport, and it says hottest day ever!
[03:52:13.187 --> 03:52:14.408]  So say goodbye to that
[03:52:15.628 --> 03:52:25.190]  Now, of course, you'll notice that these climate change activists just stop oil and the like.
[03:52:25.190 --> 03:52:30.111]  They always attack precious, historic works of art that everybody really appreciates and loves.
[03:52:30.111 --> 03:52:35.272]  They very rarely, or never in fact, attack works of modern art.
[03:52:35.272 --> 03:52:36.712]  Which brings us to our next video.
[03:52:36.712 --> 03:52:41.253]  You'll never believe what someone paid 41 million dollars for.
[03:52:41.253 --> 03:52:41.853]  This is called
[03:52:42.967 --> 03:52:44.048]  41 million for this?
[03:52:44.048 --> 03:52:45.089]  Let's roll it.
[03:52:45.089 --> 03:52:51.215]  Some idiot at an auction just paid over 41 million dollars for this.
[03:52:51.215 --> 03:52:54.197]  Cy Twombly's Untitled.
[03:52:54.197 --> 03:52:55.158]  No, I'm not joking.
[03:52:55.158 --> 03:53:06.910]  During an evening auction at Phillips in New York on Tuesday, Cy Twombly's 16-foot-wide Untitled painting from 2005, the second largest from his Bacchus series of swirling canvases,
[03:53:07.330 --> 03:53:11.632]  Sold for 41.6 million dollars, the fool and his money are easily parted.
[03:53:11.632 --> 03:53:26.340]  Imagine being so out of touch, so disgustingly rich, that during a cost of living crisis, runaway inflation chaos, with hundreds of millions of people in the west having to choose between heating and eating this winter, you can afford to do
[03:53:26.340 --> 03:53:28.481]  Listen to how these morons describe it.
[03:53:28.481 --> 03:53:29.522]  The series created between 2003 and 2009.
[03:53:48.474 --> 03:54:01.339]  2008 was inspired by the ancient Greco-Roman deity Bacchus, the god of wine, who in one way reflects the joys that alcohol can bring, while simultaneously imbuing a sense of madness that can be a by-product of alcohol addiction.
[03:54:01.339 --> 03:54:04.800]  Funny that, because the dude who shelled out the cash must have been drunk when he bought it.
[03:54:04.800 --> 03:54:11.383]  Twombly's enchantment by classical antiquity is what informed and energized his artistic practice from start to finish.
[03:54:11.383 --> 03:54:16.845]  To understand Twombly is to understand how his immersion in the fragments and fascinations of Greek and Roman culture
[03:54:17.125 --> 03:54:21.588]  Made his work a living conduit to the enduring forms, figures, and stories of the ancient world.
[03:54:21.588 --> 03:54:24.591]  If Twombly is about something, this is what it is.
[03:54:24.591 --> 03:54:35.819]  I mean, yeah, if some long-winded poncy description makes you feel better about wasting 41 million dollars on a worthless piece of crap that belongs in the skip, you do you.
[03:54:35.819 --> 03:54:38.521]  That kind of language is called obscurantism.
[03:54:38.641 --> 03:54:46.347]  Pretentious modern art people invented it to disguise the fact that modern art is hideously ugly, depressing, and objectively talentless.
[03:54:46.347 --> 03:54:54.293]  Case in point, a Piet Mondrian painting has been hanging upside down for over 75 years and no one even realized.
[03:54:54.293 --> 03:54:55.915]  Gee, I wonder why?
[03:54:55.915 --> 03:54:57.756]  One thing that differentiates an actual
[03:54:57.756 --> 03:54:58.196]  We're good to go.
[03:55:18.575 --> 03:55:35.141]  By 300 return journeys from London to Melbourne in Etihad Airways' Better Than Business residence class, including a private bathroom and an exclusive cabin, technically, you could literally buy the moon, all of it, or you could buy every single ticket at a Coldplay gig.
[03:55:35.141 --> 03:55:37.462]  Alright, the painting's suddenly starting to look like a bargain.
[03:55:40.894 --> 03:55:46.798]  Now, we're not going to have time for the final video because we've only got a couple of minutes, but I'm going to basically explain the story.
[03:55:46.798 --> 03:55:57.286]  Of course, you had the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX over the past few days with the CEO character Sam Bankman Freed.
[03:55:57.286 --> 03:55:59.107]  Very interesting name.
[03:55:59.107 --> 03:56:05.292]  But what went unnoticed amidst all this, somewhat unnoticed by the news media definitely, was his admission
[03:56:05.996 --> 03:56:11.398]  Now bear in mind that these customers within this cryptocurrency platform, they've lost all their money basically.
[03:56:11.398 --> 03:56:14.279]  Now CNN says they're going to be left with nothing.
[03:56:14.279 --> 03:56:23.003]  This guy, Bankman Freed, was the largest donor, second largest, to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.
[03:56:23.003 --> 03:56:28.245]  He's the second largest donor out of all Democratic candidates behind George Soros.
[03:56:28.245 --> 03:56:32.527]  This guy was a major, major player, which is why they're trying to gloss over this.
[03:56:33.340 --> 03:56:37.924]  Of course he's now lost basically all his net worth because of this Ponzi scheme.
[03:56:37.924 --> 03:56:41.046]  Collapsed 94% in a single day.
[03:56:41.046 --> 03:56:49.693]  But of course the true story behind this, the true irony, the true hypocrisy is that Bankman Freed is the quintessential virtue signaller.
[03:56:49.693 --> 03:56:55.578]  He's echoed all the right progressive narratives at every step along the way.
[03:56:55.578 --> 03:57:00.662]  Very interesting though, he came out in an interview with Vox's Kelsey Piper
[03:57:01.309 --> 03:57:16.103]  And admitted that woke virtue signaling is basically one huge fake smokescreen that the elite, the billionaire class, use as a communication tool to show that they're a team player within the regime.
[03:57:16.103 --> 03:57:26.453]  To show that they can basically perform these loyalty oaths to the establishment and then as a result, as a reward, get to enjoy establishment protection.
[03:57:27.327 --> 03:57:35.514]  And he basically came out and said, it's a dumb game we woke Westerners play, where we say all the right shibboleths so everyone likes us.
[03:57:35.514 --> 03:57:38.676]  He admitted that wokery is a complete fraud.
[03:57:38.676 --> 03:57:41.058]  It's a virtue signal for the billionaire class.
[03:57:41.058 --> 03:57:41.959]  War Room is next.
[03:57:41.959 --> 03:57:42.879]  Don't go away, Summit.
[03:57:46.158 --> 03:57:54.705]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[03:57:54.705 --> 03:58:04.334]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[03:58:04.334 --> 03:58:06.015]  And that's the problem.
[03:58:06.015 --> 03:58:08.777]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[03:58:08.777 --> 03:58:11.540]  They illegally changed state elections.
[03:58:12.420 --> 03:58:17.962]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[03:58:17.962 --> 03:58:19.982]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[03:58:19.982 --> 03:58:24.243]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:58:24.243 --> 03:58:39.347]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections
[03:58:40.107 --> 03:58:42.209]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:58:42.209 --> 03:58:46.372]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[03:58:46.372 --> 03:58:51.215]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[03:58:51.215 --> 03:58:57.780]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[03:58:57.780 --> 03:58:58.981]  This family that is InfoWars.
[03:59:00.819 --> 03:59:17.032]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[03:59:17.032 --> 03:59:26.139]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[03:59:27.412 --> 03:59:29.113]  I don't take the credit.
[03:59:29.113 --> 03:59:30.834]  I give you the credit.
[03:59:30.834 --> 03:59:33.435]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[03:59:33.435 --> 03:59:35.055]  It isn't going to give up.
[03:59:35.055 --> 03:59:36.896]  Without your support, we could be shut down.

[03:59:40.158 --> 03:59:47.801]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[03:59:47.801 --> 03:59:53.704]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
