[00:00.000 --> 00:10.400]  It's Thursday, November 17th, 2022, there are so many giant developments, we're about
[00:10.400 --> 00:13.000]  to hit them all now.
[00:13.000 --> 00:19.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:19.000 --> 00:29.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us, there is huge financial news,
[00:29.200 --> 00:35.000]  massive political news, ultra-massive medical news from around the world, the deep state
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.600]  of heaven to start World War III, having egg on their face now with the supposed Russian
[00:40.600 --> 00:48.800]  missile fired into Poland, it is all coming up today with several big important informative
[00:48.800 --> 00:53.560]  guests as well, I'll tell you about next segment, but the first thing I want to start
[00:53.560 --> 01:02.640]  drilling into is the UN official plan going back to when it was founded in 1946, 47, officially
[01:02.640 --> 01:09.800]  in 47, at the Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco, was to get rid of borders and merge countries
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.560]  so there's no culture that has its own culture and its own independence, and then by the
[01:14.560 --> 01:19.920]  70s they developed a plan called replacement migration to encourage the first world not
[01:19.920 --> 01:24.480]  to have children and then replace them with third world populations that were more easily
[01:24.480 --> 01:29.800]  managed and controlled who never had any history of freedom, the globalist competition with
[01:29.800 --> 01:35.520]  the western Christian ideal of the Renaissance and upward mobility, they want you to own
[01:35.520 --> 01:40.320]  nothing and have nothing and like it as they say, you don't have air conditioning or a
[01:40.320 --> 01:44.520]  car but you don't have heating in the winter but Klaus Schwab has five private jets and
[01:44.520 --> 01:48.480]  that's okay because he's Klaus Schwab, well now yesterday, this is really taking the internet
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.200]  by storm, we covered it yesterday, we'll get back into it today, Chuck E. Schumer said
[01:52.200 --> 01:56.040]  we need totally open borders because people in America aren't having enough kids, we've
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.040]  got to replace those that are dying, well I have the official UN replacement migration
[02:00.040 --> 02:04.080]  plans from just two years ago, but if you talk about it, you get taken off the internet
[02:04.080 --> 02:09.000]  because the ADL is God and says that's not allowed, here's Chuck E. Schumer yesterday.
[02:09.000 --> 02:16.120]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers, we have a population that is not reproducing
[02:16.120 --> 02:21.240]  it on its own with the same level that it used to, the only way we're going to have
[02:21.240 --> 02:26.520]  a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all
[02:26.520 --> 02:30.800]  of them because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but get a path to citizenship
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.680]  for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[02:35.680 --> 02:41.000]  Alright, so here's a brief supercut, there's hours of this, the deep staters and there
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.360]  are many in saying you're not allowed to talk about bringing in foreigners who replace
[02:45.360 --> 02:50.080]  a dying population, here's that supercut, we'll be right back to watch the full broadcast.
[02:50.080 --> 02:55.040]  It seems harder and harder to ignore that the echoes of replacement theory and other
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.600]  racially motivated views are increasingly coming out into the open.
[02:59.600 --> 03:03.800]  In a few years we're going to be a majority brown country, white people will not be the
[03:03.800 --> 03:05.040]  majority in the country anymore.
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.240]  This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a
[03:10.240 --> 03:12.680]  minority of the generation at some point.
[03:12.680 --> 03:18.160]  Because of 2007, every year babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority.
[03:18.160 --> 03:20.920]  In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.
[03:20.920 --> 03:25.120]  As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which
[03:25.120 --> 03:26.120]  is coming.
[03:26.120 --> 03:30.920]  Demographics is destiny, demographics is destiny, demographics is destiny, right?
[03:30.920 --> 03:32.120]  The country is changing.
[03:32.120 --> 03:36.360]  I've been saying it here, other people have been saying it here for years now, even before
[03:36.360 --> 03:39.920]  Donald Trump, that demographics is destiny.
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.920]  The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the
[03:43.920 --> 03:47.760]  number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.720]  So we live in a country where the demographics are changing, it's becoming less white?
[03:50.720 --> 03:51.720]  Correct.
[03:51.720 --> 03:56.600]  Okay, you'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic
[03:56.600 --> 03:58.120]  nominee for president.
[03:58.120 --> 04:03.080]  It's changing, it's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of demographics,
[04:03.080 --> 04:04.320]  because of the population growth.
[04:04.320 --> 04:09.400]  The growth in Texas has been almost entirely driven by non-white population growth, mostly
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.000]  by Hispanic and Latino population growth.
[04:12.000 --> 04:20.520]  The idea that whites will not be the majority, I mean, it's an exciting transformation of
[04:20.520 --> 04:21.520]  the country.
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.840]  It's an exciting evolution and progress of our country in many different ways.
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.760]  The white population is declining, it was always on the upswing.
[04:31.760 --> 04:35.680]  So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.
[04:35.680 --> 04:42.840]  That speaks to how that population, the demographics, will weigh in politically.
[04:42.840 --> 04:48.320]  I believe anybody who acts as a replacement is to blame, not for this particular crime,
[04:48.320 --> 04:55.080]  but for no purpose, no purpose, except profit and or political benefit.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.080]  And it's wrong.
[04:56.080 --> 04:58.080]  It's just simply wrong.
[04:58.080 --> 05:03.200]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.200]  Why is this taking so long?
[05:04.200 --> 05:07.880]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[05:07.880 --> 05:09.160]  Why can't we do this here?
[05:09.160 --> 05:11.680]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.960]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump
[05:15.960 --> 05:17.760]  or Governor DeSantimonious.
[05:17.760 --> 05:21.640]  They're going to deny us Michigan, they're going to deny us Pennsylvania, they're going
[05:21.640 --> 05:28.400]  to deny us Arizona, and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.960]  where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one of them.
[05:33.960 --> 05:38.040]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[05:38.040 --> 05:41.760]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[05:41.760 --> 05:43.600]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[05:43.600 --> 05:47.240]  That's why infowars.com is so damn important.
[05:47.240 --> 05:50.640]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[05:50.640 --> 05:52.760]  People need to get behind info wars.
[05:52.760 --> 05:57.960]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[05:57.960 --> 06:11.280]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[06:11.280 --> 06:16.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:16.120 --> 06:17.840]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:17.840 --> 06:24.640]  Well, so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.640 --> 06:33.400]  It's the Thursday, November 17th edition, one of the top long track record of being
[06:33.400 --> 06:43.800]  extremely accurate economists will be joining us coming up in the third hour, Martin Armstrong.
[06:43.800 --> 06:47.480]  Matt Baker, who's an incredible citizen activist, one of the most powerful speeches at city
[06:47.480 --> 06:51.000]  councils and state legislatures, is going to be popping in and joining us as the model
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.520]  of taking the info war peacefully to the enemy, but also be opening the phones up today and
[06:55.520 --> 07:02.000]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour ahead of the war room, 3 p.m. with the
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.880]  great Owen Schreuer, of course, we're here every weekday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central,
[07:07.880 --> 07:17.320]  proceeding the incredibly impacting, smart analysis of Harrison Smith and his crew and
[07:17.320 --> 07:27.520]  guest as well with American Journal, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. central, okay.
[07:27.520 --> 07:28.520]  Let's just do this.
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.160]  Let me first explain to your TV viewer, not a radio listener, I'll describe it for radio
[07:32.160 --> 07:33.160]  listeners.
[07:33.160 --> 07:40.080]  While we have a dystopic image of Washington D.C., an artist rendering of what D.C. would
[07:40.080 --> 07:47.640]  look like a few years after it was depopulated by a hydrogen bomb going off over it, an air
[07:47.640 --> 07:54.720]  burst attack, because that's where this country and where this world is going, if the type
[07:54.720 --> 07:59.760]  of insanity that is accelerating and spiraling out of control in Ukraine and that proxy war
[07:59.760 --> 08:04.600]  with NATO, the U.S. against Russia.
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.960]  We have the Associated Press doing a retraction yesterday, we have Reuters doing a retraction,
[08:08.960 --> 08:14.240]  we have a bunch of publications doing retractions, we have Polish government ministers and mayors
[08:14.240 --> 08:18.600]  in the town that got hit and the rest of them coming out and saying, look, it's a Ukrainian
[08:18.600 --> 08:23.160]  missile and they've now looked at the trajectory and even Poland admits, I've got the articles
[08:23.160 --> 08:27.960]  right here, that it was shot over 100 miles off course in the wrong direction and not
[08:27.960 --> 08:32.600]  even shot at Russian aircraft.
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.880]  And probably a provocation by Zelensky who immediately said it was Russian and still
[08:37.880 --> 08:42.000]  says it's Russian and says he won't back down it's Russian and then the Secretary of Defense
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.040]  comes out of your state and says, well, it doesn't matter who shot it, it's still Russia's
[08:45.040 --> 08:49.960]  fault because they started the war, but they didn't really start the war, the globalists
[08:49.960 --> 08:54.800]  overthrew the elected government almost nine years ago there and we all know what happened
[08:54.800 --> 08:55.800]  since then.
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.720]  If the Russians were on our doorstep, like the West is on their doorstep, I would expect
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.400]  we would be in a war with that proxy state as well, but they're not in Mexico, they're
[09:04.400 --> 09:09.560]  not in Canada, they're over there defending their country, while Chinese troops are training
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.080]  confirmed in Mexico and in Canada, so that's a real threat setting up their own secret
[09:15.080 --> 09:21.040]  intelligence bases and public police stations across the United States and the rest of the
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.040]  world.
[09:22.040 --> 09:27.400]  So Polish politician blames Ukraine for missile provocation, Associated Press issues correction
[09:27.400 --> 09:32.240]  to its fake report which could have kicked off World War III, that's up on info wars.com,
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.840]  Zelensky is doubling now saying it was a Russian missile, Cernovich makes a great point, going
[09:38.840 --> 09:44.000]  to war over a hoax almost happened yesterday would be consistent with the reasons America
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.080]  got into nearly every other modern war, World War I, the Lusitania to the Gulf of Tonkin,
[09:50.080 --> 09:56.520]  to the USS Liberty, sailors survived that one, busting the scam, but watching friends
[09:56.520 --> 10:03.600]  die, Cernovich went on to ask if Alex Jones has to pay $1.5 billion they're now saying
[10:03.600 --> 10:07.480]  for questioning Sandy Hook, the judge found me guilty, the jury was just told to decide
[10:07.480 --> 10:14.400]  how guilty, well what does the mainstream media and Zelensky pay for trying to start
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.120]  World War III on purpose lying to us, and again that's how this works ladies and gentlemen,
[10:20.120 --> 10:24.000]  they think you're stupid, they think you're mindless, they think you're idiots, they think
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.160]  oh well if Jones is found guilty of all these horrible things I didn't do, the judge said
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.280]  I was guilty, the jury was told to find out how guilty and how much money, he must be
[10:32.280 --> 10:37.560]  about to go off the air because you can't pay $1.4 billion, there's things called appeals,
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.800]  we don't have that money, there's things called bankruptcy, but they want to convince you
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.320]  we're going off the air so you give up and don't spread the word about the broadcast
[10:45.320 --> 10:49.840]  when we are the most influential and the most effective we've ever been because we have
[10:49.840 --> 10:54.240]  accurately predicted what would happen up until this point and now what is about to
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.840]  happen in the near and mid and long term future that is very, very bad if we don't stop it.
[10:59.840 --> 11:08.760]  So there's that whole area and then there's this huge stack that is so critical and so
[11:08.760 --> 11:13.320]  important that I'm going to hit starting here in a moment and into the next segment.
[11:13.320 --> 11:16.640]  Chuck E. Schumer really captured the attention of the internet, it's really the top story
[11:16.640 --> 11:23.080]  out there just from my perusal, a lot of different sites and platforms that Schumer came out
[11:23.080 --> 11:30.360]  and said that we need to replace the dying American population that's not having enough
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.560]  children with foreigners and he used the term replace, well that's an official UN plan,
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.600]  the replacement system.
[11:37.600 --> 11:40.720]  If you talk about it to show the documents, the ADL calls for you to be taken off air
[11:40.720 --> 11:48.000]  or censored or put in prison in some speeches when it's being promoted by the globalist
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.400]  not just here but in Europe as well to bring in permanent underclasses.
[11:53.400 --> 11:58.000]  We've got all the SPLC reports and the rest of it but then meanwhile we have the left
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.640]  all cheering saying white people are inherently evil and inherently bad and need to be replaced
[12:03.640 --> 12:09.120]  so it's just anti-white racism because the left sees the world as 90% non-white and so
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.240]  a ruling class of white people can then play racial politics and try to play brown people
[12:14.240 --> 12:19.040]  off against what's left of white people, it is called divide and conquer, plain and simple,
[12:19.040 --> 12:21.400]  that is all coming up.
[12:21.400 --> 12:26.720]  Also Republicans as officials, now the Washington Post says so, win back control of the House
[12:26.720 --> 12:32.440]  with narrow majority, McConnell reelected Senate GOP leader not going anywhere, Nancy
[12:32.440 --> 12:37.600]  Pelosi announced future plans for GOP wins the House, House Republicans launch Hunter
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.920]  Biden probe, alleged president played active role in Sun's business dealings, well it's
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.640]  in all the damn emails and videos and audio recordings, they were directly under the command
[12:46.640 --> 12:51.360]  of the head of Chinese intelligence, that's all confirmed, House Republicans alleged Biden
[12:51.360 --> 12:55.360]  directly involved in business dealings with Sun Hunter, now they'll also alleged that
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.760]  the sky is blue and the birds flying in the air and say tweet, tweet, tweet, so we're
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.680]  going to be going over all of that today and then more incredible announcements out of
[13:04.680 --> 13:10.080]  the G20 meeting of world government, world taxes, world surveillance, carbon taxes, vaccine
[13:10.080 --> 13:17.240]  passports just incredible, but then even on their own Twitter and Instagram sites run
[13:17.240 --> 13:25.360]  by the WEF, the ADL comes in and says now this doesn't exist, they actually run it and
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.280]  they put an announcement up saying there's no world government and there's no new world
[13:29.280 --> 13:34.040]  order, so simultaneously that's 1984, world government's good, it's going to run your
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.120]  life, it's going to totally take control of you, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing
[13:38.120 --> 13:42.080]  and you're going to be replaced, but if you don't like it, we're going to replace you
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.480]  faster and shut your bank account off, absolutely insane, I've got a bunch of key clubs and
[13:47.480 --> 13:52.680]  information along that front and speaking of censorship, we all saw when Google parent
[13:52.680 --> 13:58.680]  company of YouTube brought down a Kanye West drink champs interview, well now they're going
[13:58.680 --> 14:06.320]  on to Google servers and into people's servers that they think is their private Google account
[14:06.320 --> 14:13.720]  and they are erasing it off of your own, what you think are your own private servers, little
[14:13.720 --> 14:20.000]  deletes Kanye West interview video of personal Google drives, this is the next level of big
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.800]  tech total censorship, they want everything on the cloud so they can delete everything
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.240]  in real time in a high tech version of Joe Stalin famously airbrushing out political
[14:30.240 --> 14:36.640]  opposition that he had killed or sent to the gulags from newspapers and from other publications,
[14:36.640 --> 14:43.560]  so that's all coming up today and so much more and as I said I'll also be taking phone
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.280]  calls, please don't forget Christmas is almost here and you should do your Christmas shopping

[17:05.720 --> 17:11.360]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[17:11.360 --> 17:15.000]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.400]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and
[17:19.400 --> 17:25.440]  all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.760]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[17:39.000 --> 17:44.000]  products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family,

[17:48.240 --> 17:54.440]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarsstore.com.
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.720]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[17:59.720 --> 18:05.600]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.960]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.840]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[18:14.840 --> 18:15.840]  to speak freely.
[18:15.840 --> 18:18.960]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next or they're going to go for Steve Bannon
[18:18.960 --> 18:20.480]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[18:20.480 --> 18:24.800]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all
[18:24.800 --> 18:29.000]  of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.400]  your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the
[18:32.400 --> 18:36.520]  planet not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist
[18:36.520 --> 18:37.520]  agenda.
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.200]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[18:41.200 --> 18:42.880]  because of your past support.
[18:42.880 --> 18:46.680]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[18:46.680 --> 18:51.080]  free double your efforts of visiting infowarsstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.080]  on air.
[18:52.080 --> 18:57.520]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is infowarsstore.com and I thank you all for
[18:57.520 --> 18:58.520]  your support.
[18:58.520 --> 19:05.560]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[19:05.560 --> 19:12.120]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America but the world.
[19:12.120 --> 19:17.640]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war but I don't
[19:17.640 --> 19:18.640]  deserve the credit.
[19:18.640 --> 19:23.560]  Yes, I've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support Info Wars are the real
[19:23.560 --> 19:26.120]  reason we've had the success.
[19:26.120 --> 19:30.520]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever
[19:30.520 --> 19:31.520]  had.
[19:31.520 --> 19:38.240]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[19:38.240 --> 19:42.200]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[19:42.200 --> 19:45.040]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[19:45.040 --> 19:50.720]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[19:50.720 --> 19:54.600]  now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[19:54.600 --> 20:01.360]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[20:01.360 --> 20:11.360]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.360 --> 20:20.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to bore you with all the attacks that we're under,
[20:20.320 --> 20:25.040]  not just publicly but behind the scenes but your prayers and support of this broadcast
[20:25.040 --> 20:30.560]  are so critical and the tactics they're using in Info Wars, they're planning to use against
[20:30.560 --> 20:35.160]  you and your family under their world government plan, we'll be getting to next segment but
[20:35.160 --> 20:41.520]  imagine the mind control, the arrogant brainwashing, they think we're so stupid that I can play
[20:41.520 --> 20:47.280]  you hours, you've all seen it, of every leftist talk show and mainline talk show in America,
[20:47.280 --> 20:54.680]  ABC, NBC, CBS, NPR, Washington Post, your local newspaper saying white people are inherently
[20:54.680 --> 20:57.560]  evil.
[20:57.560 --> 21:02.880]  And all this asinine garbage run by the deep state, run by Hollywood and then saying it's
[21:02.880 --> 21:07.480]  so good that white people will soon disappear, that will create virtue.
[21:07.480 --> 21:12.080]  Well, Hitler said that certain groups didn't have virtue and deserve to die, that's what
[21:12.080 --> 21:15.560]  the left's basically saying today, in fact we all need to die, there's too many of us,
[21:15.560 --> 21:20.760]  support the babies, sterilize people under transgenderism, push not just government
[21:20.760 --> 21:29.640]  sponsor but government forced and bullied euthanasia, forced suicide, government murder, so they're
[21:29.640 --> 21:37.800]  the bad guys and they wrap themselves in this leftist liberal mantle of holier than them
[21:37.800 --> 21:42.960]  and countless newscasts, countless ADL and Southern Barbara Law Center press conferences
[21:42.960 --> 21:48.720]  that if people talk about replacement migration, they are Nazis, but it's an official UN plan
[21:48.720 --> 21:52.680]  since they got founded in the late 40s, it's in documents since then, over and over again
[21:52.680 --> 21:59.960]  I'll show you some in a moment, but this clip has gone viral of Chuck E. Schumer saying
[21:59.960 --> 22:05.520]  we need to replace Americans that aren't reproducing with third world populations, a permanent
[22:05.520 --> 22:12.160]  underclass, they control who they say will then vote Democrat and keep them in power.
[22:12.160 --> 22:16.960]  The globalists in the EU are using the same tactics, so here's Chuck E. Schumer yesterday.
[22:16.960 --> 22:24.120]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers, we have a population that is not reproducing
[22:24.120 --> 22:27.960]  it on its own with the same level that it used to.
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.800]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants,
[22:32.800 --> 22:37.400]  the dreamers and all of them, because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but
[22:37.400 --> 22:44.720]  get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[22:44.720 --> 22:49.840]  And advertise all this free stuff if you get to Europe or the United States, but then citizens
[22:49.840 --> 22:55.720]  like David Icke if they criticize force injections, he can't travel to Europe and similar things
[22:55.720 --> 23:00.040]  here, you can't travel, you can't leave your house if they say you can't, but everybody
[23:00.040 --> 23:05.240]  else can just come on, come on, come on, come on, so let's show some of the documents.
[23:05.240 --> 23:08.920]  Great replacement Schumer calls for blanket amnesty of millions of illegals to offset
[23:08.920 --> 23:15.200]  declining U.S. population has all the videos, all the links and the U.N. documents there
[23:15.200 --> 23:19.040]  for you revealed U.N. plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[23:19.040 --> 23:20.040]  That's their number.
[23:20.040 --> 23:21.040]  That's from 2018.
[23:21.040 --> 23:25.160]  We were the first to really break this big when it was out of the public consciousness
[23:25.160 --> 23:28.440]  and national media attack, as I said, we were evil and we were bad.
[23:28.440 --> 23:32.400]  It wasn't true, but they never actually fact checked the documents.
[23:32.400 --> 23:33.920]  And here are the documents.
[23:33.920 --> 23:37.960]  The U.N. is pushing the dangerous replacement migration conspiracy theory, but it's good
[23:37.960 --> 23:40.480]  when they actually push it as a reality.
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.680]  Here's one of the documents from the year 2000, population division, department of economic
[23:44.680 --> 23:49.760]  and social affairs, United Nations, you can read the whole report for yourself and it
[23:49.760 --> 23:51.480]  goes on and on.
[23:51.480 --> 23:55.440]  Southern Poverty Law Center, the race is great replacement theory explained, doesn't exist,
[23:55.440 --> 23:59.800]  it's white supremacist, you're totally insane if you talk about it.
[23:59.800 --> 24:05.080]  There's another executive summary from the U.N. pushing it with their framework for replacement
[24:05.080 --> 24:06.240]  migration.
[24:06.240 --> 24:13.240]  It's their word, it's their name, and then the mind control is so great you're not supposed
[24:13.240 --> 24:16.720]  to talk about it when they do it in your face.
[24:16.720 --> 24:21.680]  And here's the U.N. document, yet again, I suggest everybody go read it.
[24:21.680 --> 24:26.040]  But also, if you criticize forced injections or lockdowns, the ADL says, you're a white
[24:26.040 --> 24:31.720]  supremacist and gives Albert Borla, the head of Pfizer, who forced this deadly Joseph Mingola
[24:31.720 --> 24:37.120]  shot on us, but we have the Nuremberg Code, literally Joseph Mingola 2.0, but you're a
[24:37.120 --> 24:41.840]  Nazi if you don't let us inside your body to control what you're doing.
[24:41.840 --> 24:46.160]  This is an invasion of our bodies, an invasion of our sovereignty, a total takeover.
[24:46.160 --> 24:54.720]  But don't worry, FTX gave more than $30 million running its own fake studies to then create
[24:54.720 --> 25:00.720]  fake studies so they could try to ban hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and more, and the ADL backed
[25:00.720 --> 25:07.360]  them up too and said, you're anti-Semitic if you talk about any type of alternate treatment.
[25:07.360 --> 25:10.960]  You don't like open borders, if you question elections, if you question forced injections,
[25:10.960 --> 25:19.160]  you are a Nazi, and that's the official Joe Biden battle plan from June of 2021 as well.
[25:19.160 --> 25:23.320]  But they've got a problem, even NBC News admits, anti-vaxxers were right, and the shots are
[25:23.320 --> 25:33.320]  causing a 100 times plus, not 100%, 100 times increase in heart attacks, myocarditis, and
[25:33.320 --> 25:36.480]  then here's a whole other report on that as well.
[25:36.480 --> 25:41.320]  But it's okay because the UN has all these propaganda commercials that I'm going to air
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.360]  when we come back, telling you how fashionable and how incredibly cool it is for everybody
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.440]  to be under this and to live under these systems.
[25:51.440 --> 25:58.560]  So this is all UN directed, I remember in 2017 there was a big NBC headline, there was
[25:58.560 --> 26:05.000]  a Reuters headline as well that both showed George Soros with the head of the UN replacement
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.240]  migration program, the refugee program, saying, oh, we give multi-thousand euro, multi-thousand
[26:13.240 --> 26:19.560]  dollar cards without any names on it, to people to get them out of their countries in the Middle
[26:19.560 --> 26:25.040]  East and Africa and poor areas of Asia, Latin America, into Europe, into the United States,
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.000]  and then we've masked them at UN refugee centers near the border and then flood the borders.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.040]  Meanwhile, here in the US, we already have open borders, but it will supercharge that
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.040]  flooding.
[26:36.040 --> 26:42.480]  It'll turbocharge it if they get rid of Title 42, which Biden says he is, where the government
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.240]  won't even have the power if you are a convicted felon, a pedophile, an arsonist, a murderer
[26:48.240 --> 26:54.640]  to deport you, no power to deport, basically, period, beyond castrating what's left of
[26:54.640 --> 26:55.640]  ICE.
[26:55.640 --> 27:01.480]  And then ICE will be used to keep us in, and it's a domestic control system with a TSA
[27:01.480 --> 27:05.880]  they've already announced to be on the streets of America, but everybody else can come to
[27:05.880 --> 27:11.840]  the country, you just can't get out of the country unless you are a good little globalist.
[27:11.840 --> 27:18.560]  So that's all coming up in the next segment, straight ahead, infowars.com, tomorrow's news
[27:18.560 --> 27:19.560]  today.
[27:19.560 --> 27:25.360]  We've also got a lot of shocking new video of Biden beyond brain dead, beyond dementia,
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.400]  not knowing where he's at, world leaders like Turkey's leader trying to talk to him,
[27:29.400 --> 27:35.040]  he came and talked to him, Erdogan looks completely perplexed, also new photos on infowars.com,
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.600]  but Biden's weird written instructions like he's a dog, you will walk, you will sit, you
[27:40.600 --> 27:44.960]  will talk, you will read, you will get up, you will walk to the left, and Biden mumbles
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.920]  over all of these, showing the true puppet behavior we're dealing with at another video
[27:49.920 --> 27:54.920]  of the new puppet prime minister in the UK with the puppet leader Trudeau, Hollings
[27:54.920 --> 28:00.360]  Zalinsky up, they look like two schoolgirls, so they're giggling and snickering while they
[28:00.360 --> 28:01.360]  do it.
[28:01.360 --> 28:07.680]  And then we're going to get back into FTX, they now have the chapter bankruptcy trustee
[28:07.680 --> 28:13.960]  that ran the Enron takeover, has now taken over FTX and he says it's worse than even
[28:13.960 --> 28:21.800]  Enron, he's never seen anything this bad, total fraud, total money-ondering, total scam,
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.120]  but don't worry it'll all get swept under the rug, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.920]  So that's who these people are, they lie to you with the elections they steal, and with
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.400]  the PCR tests that are a fraud, and with the central banks, and with the hijacking of cryptocurrencies,
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.520]  everything you do is just a lawless criminal operation, but it was the internet that exposed
[28:43.520 --> 28:49.840]  Sam Bankman fried, and fried their big operation will continue to fry everything these criminals
[28:49.840 --> 28:54.080]  are up to, and that's why they're so upset, and that's why they're so scared.
[28:54.080 --> 29:07.720]  It's November 2022 and that means our historic biggest sale of the year is now live at infowarstore.com.

[29:56.160 --> 29:58.640]  system plus it keeps us on air, I win-win.
[29:58.640 --> 30:05.720]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day counting
[30:05.720 --> 30:12.560]  these mail-in ballots, and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[30:12.560 --> 30:19.200]  when we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day, and that's the problem.
[30:19.200 --> 30:25.760]  And everything changed after COVID-19, they illegally changed state elections, mailing
[30:25.760 --> 30:30.760]  ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[30:30.760 --> 30:35.400]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election, we're in a serious country when we have elections
[30:35.400 --> 30:39.920]  that can be stolen like this, and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[30:39.920 --> 30:45.640]  stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and
[30:45.640 --> 30:51.600]  the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact
[30:51.600 --> 30:55.320]  that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[30:55.320 --> 31:01.840]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[31:01.840 --> 31:06.920]  I'm pointing my finger at you, and I'm also pointing it right back at myself.

[31:19.480 --> 31:23.160]  constantly forget, and when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.

[32:54.120 --> 33:23.760]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[33:23.760 --> 33:29.040]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:29.040 --> 33:35.640]  So a few weeks ago, the mouth of the New World Order, Atlantic Monthly Magazine, I'm
[33:35.640 --> 33:42.280]  that old Jeffrey Epstein crew, they came out and said, we want amnesty from making you
[33:42.280 --> 33:45.280]  wear a mask and trying to inject you in lockdowns.
[33:45.280 --> 33:49.520]  We're sorry, please don't attack us, don't sue us, don't criticize us, they know we've
[33:49.520 --> 33:53.960]  reached critical mass, the organizations, the movements, the scientists, the doctors,
[33:53.960 --> 33:54.960]  all the evidence is coming out.
[33:54.960 --> 33:55.960]  They killed us on purpose.
[33:55.960 --> 33:56.960]  They created the virus.
[33:56.960 --> 33:57.960]  They released it.
[33:57.960 --> 34:01.320]  The shots grow nanoparticles in the body that create all these blood clots, basically mad
[34:01.320 --> 34:06.920]  cow disease, inhuman, spongiform, encephalophathy, but a more advanced, more deadly type that
[34:06.920 --> 34:07.920]  progresses much quicker.
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.000]  I mean, they've hit us with just total devastation.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.960]  I'm sure half the folks who've taken the shot will be dead in a few years.
[34:14.960 --> 34:17.160]  Already massive numbers are dead.
[34:17.160 --> 34:22.880]  The only saving races, if you don't keep it at 87 degrees or lower, in just a few hours,
[34:22.880 --> 34:26.600]  the little nanoparticles need to be in your hot body to live and spread.
[34:26.600 --> 34:27.600]  They die.
[34:27.600 --> 34:33.240]  So most folks got dead shots because of the incompetency of the system and their minions.
[34:33.240 --> 34:34.240]  So that worked against them.
[34:34.240 --> 34:37.480]  So the kill rate was much lower, still off the charts bad.
[34:37.480 --> 34:45.320]  Meanwhile, they're running TV ads in the US and TV ads in Europe and everywhere.
[34:45.320 --> 34:52.120]  And I was in a hotel room a few weeks ago at the Texas coast with my wife and five-year-old
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.560]  taking a few days off, and I said, okay, let's let her watch some children's cartoons.
[34:56.560 --> 34:58.560]  Let's see what's on.
[34:58.560 --> 35:04.920]  So we were watching on some cartoon channel, an old Bugs Bunny show.
[35:04.920 --> 35:13.080]  But when it went to break, it was Elmo saying, you need to take your shot or you'll die,
[35:13.080 --> 35:15.120]  which you're not supposed to target children with advertising.
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.280]  It's lying to them that saying, once you take the shot, it's safe and you'll be protected.
[35:21.280 --> 35:24.760]  So that's Elmo targeting children, and the ads are out there.
[35:24.760 --> 35:25.760]  We've already covered them.
[35:25.760 --> 35:35.520]  But it was just sitting there in a hotel room by the beach, watching a puppet tell your
[35:35.520 --> 35:43.840]  children to take a poison, Joseph Mingala, death shot was just next level.
[35:43.840 --> 35:46.520]  And it's going on, it's going on everywhere.
[35:46.520 --> 35:48.520]  In fact, they found the ads.
[35:48.520 --> 35:49.520]  Once you got audio, let me know.
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.920]  We'll actually play it since I mentioned it.
[35:51.920 --> 35:57.280]  It's a great job just within seconds to be mentioning something, finding something.
[35:57.280 --> 35:59.600]  So I'm sitting there watching them target my daughters.
[35:59.600 --> 36:00.600]  We turn the TV off.
[36:00.600 --> 36:03.680]  We're like, my God, can't even watch an old Warner Brothers show with your 70s salmon
[36:03.680 --> 36:09.880]  Bugs Bunny because the ads are weaponized, pure evil during the breaks.
[36:09.880 --> 36:11.440]  This is just everywhere.
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.880]  And so we're the only country in the world that's saying mandated for schools, five and
[36:15.880 --> 36:21.000]  up, six months and old authorized when it erases your immune system and does all this.
[36:21.000 --> 36:27.000]  But then meanwhile, we have the UN running ads targeting women where the woman kind of
[36:27.000 --> 36:33.280]  dressed up in a vampire outfit with a vial of the so-called COVID vaccine, the spike
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.240]  protein replicating nanotech.
[36:37.240 --> 36:43.920]  And she's in her little Vogue outfit with the quote COVID-19 vaccine, saying how sexy
[36:43.920 --> 36:49.280]  and cool and what a luxury it is to have a heart attack or get microcarditis or have
[36:49.280 --> 36:50.280]  your ovaries destroyed.
[36:50.280 --> 36:55.160]  Of course, they don't tell you that they say, let's make the vaccine accessible for everyone,
[36:55.160 --> 36:56.160]  not just the rich.
[36:56.160 --> 36:59.520]  So they're making it like a diamonds forever commercial.
[36:59.520 --> 37:06.080]  We've got another ad out of Canada, Canadian child vaccine ad, and it shows children as
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.600]  these dirty little spit creatures that are spreading germs and disease.
[37:10.600 --> 37:15.040]  And even though they don't get sick from COVID, their monsters, if you haven't erased their
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.880]  immune system and given them this deadly shot, because they're going to make you sick.
[37:19.880 --> 37:23.400]  These little criminals, these little dirty monsters.
[37:23.400 --> 37:26.200]  If you don't shoot them up with this.
[37:26.200 --> 37:28.240]  So absolutely, truly sickening.
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.120]  Let's go ahead and air these propaganda Joseph Mingola advertisements back to back.
[37:34.120 --> 37:37.760]  She's gonna make you sick.
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.720]  Oh, so sexy.
[37:42.720 --> 37:45.120]  Oh, everybody wants to.
[37:45.120 --> 37:46.120]  So cool.
[37:46.120 --> 37:47.120]  Oh, rub it on your lip.
[37:47.120 --> 37:48.120]  So sexual.
[37:48.120 --> 37:49.120]  Very salic.
[37:49.120 --> 37:50.120]  Such a luxury.
[37:50.120 --> 38:03.120]  By the way, this comes as Pfizer just raised the price of the shot to create a scarcity
[38:03.120 --> 38:13.680]  idea. Artificial scarcity over 100 times. Look at that evil child. You think they're
[38:13.680 --> 38:23.640]  nice but they're disease carriers. We've got to control them now. Give them the shot.
[38:23.640 --> 38:35.920]  Give them the slow death. Give them the future. What a loving, loving system. And there's
[38:35.920 --> 38:42.880]  so many mystery chemicals and weird nanotech toxins in the shots. Turns out by the company
[38:42.880 --> 38:49.000]  Jeffrey Epstein created and ran with secret genomic manipulation. What could go wrong?
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.720]  Vaccine ingredient SM 102 created by Epstein's genome project. That liberal, that loving
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.560]  and then like all these ads for the black community. I got the vaccine. You got the
[39:00.560 --> 39:08.200]  vaccine. You to get the vaccine. So we'll be protected. Here's the Elmo ad and then
[39:08.200 --> 39:18.720]  we'll play the run DMC ad. Daddy has super duper bandages just like Elmo. You were super
[39:18.720 --> 39:25.160]  duper today getting your COVID vaccine, Elmo. There was a little pinch but it was okay.
[39:25.160 --> 39:33.240]  I was really glad to have daddy and baby David there with him. I had a lot of questions
[39:33.240 --> 39:39.480]  about Elmo getting the COVID vaccine. Was it safe? Was it the right decision? I talked
[39:39.480 --> 39:45.800]  to our pediatrician so I could make the right choice. I learned that Elmo getting vaccinated
[39:45.800 --> 39:51.720]  is the best way to keep himself, our friends, neighbors and everyone else healthy and enjoying
[39:51.720 --> 39:58.920]  the things they love. Oh, come on, baby. David have a question. Can we have a hug? Oh, come
[39:58.920 --> 40:05.560]  here, son. Elmo loves you, daddy. I love you too. It's okay to have questions about
[40:05.560 --> 40:10.280]  COVID vaccines for your kids. Get the latest facts by speaking to your pediatrician or
[40:10.280 --> 40:11.400]  healthcare provider.
[40:11.400 --> 40:29.320]  You got the vaccine. We got the vaccine. We got the vaccine. We can get back the norm.
[40:29.320 --> 40:37.320]  Let me inform you. Let's all get the vaccine. It's about community. I'm talking unity for
[40:37.320 --> 40:41.320]  you and me. If Doc says it's good to trust me, it's good. Now let's all get the vaccine.
[40:41.320 --> 40:46.920]  Nine out of 10 people won't get sick. That's 90% effective and legit. Just call everything
[40:46.920 --> 40:52.680]  that's real and it will find you. It's killing our people. Let me remind you. Back in the days,
[40:52.680 --> 40:57.960]  back in the days, they were slowly old smallpox. Back in the days, measles and mumps man. Back
[40:57.960 --> 41:03.160]  in the days, but because of the vaccines, none of those days. Vaccines, they work to trigger
[41:03.160 --> 41:07.080]  immunity. We'll give you trust, Kiki. We'll give you samples too. We're gonna kill you.
[41:07.080 --> 41:15.640]  We're gonna abort you and murder you too. Vaccine before it's too late for real.
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.880]  And then they created a bunch of other ads with RumDMC where it's like, the Nazis want
[41:19.880 --> 41:25.000]  to kill us with eugenics too and to ski as well, but I'm not gonna not let them fool you.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.640]  You stop the Nazis and the white supremacists. Take the shot and we're gonna win. I mean,
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.440]  seriously. Meanwhile, it's the literal globalist running the attack that are doing it.
[41:34.440 --> 41:41.080]  It's just insane. If you don't let them Joseph mingle with you and take over your body and give
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.840]  you illegal experimental shots and bully you or force you into it, you're a Nazi.
[41:47.240 --> 41:51.880]  By the way, the crew did a great job finding the LMO ad, but that's not the LMO ad I saw.
[41:51.880 --> 41:55.800]  But I meant to tell you guys this at the time, but I didn't. Go search the LMO ads. It's an
[41:55.800 --> 42:01.640]  ad with an older black man, the grandpa. And he goes, I didn't trust it. People lied to me
[42:01.640 --> 42:06.840]  and told me it wasn't good. But then I checked the facts with a pediatrician and learned it totally
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.600]  protects you and is totally safe. So now I gave it to my granddaughter and she's safe. All lies
[42:12.600 --> 42:19.320]  doesn't protect you experimental alive. They're like, I heard people lying out there, but I went
[42:19.320 --> 42:25.080]  and I talked to the pediatrician that's bought off and paid off and a criminal piece of garbage.
[42:25.080 --> 42:29.960]  And they told me it's safe. Now, my granddaughter had a heart attack and is dead now, but that's
[42:29.960 --> 42:36.440]  okay. Of course, he didn't say that. No, I was like, that's right. Give it to your granddaughter.
[42:36.440 --> 42:45.880]  It's good. Man. Oh man. All right, world government, digital currency, all out in the open, huge
[42:45.880 --> 42:51.640]  developments on that front. Man, these people are evil. They are depopulating us. That's their
[42:51.640 --> 42:56.040]  goal. That's their mission. And they're following through with it. You are targeted for death.
[42:56.040 --> 43:03.480]  Alex, why is this taking so long? Why is this taking so long? In France,
[43:03.480 --> 43:07.880]  they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day. Why can't we do this here? The
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.240]  answer is fraud and corruption. If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.360]  nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis. They're going to deny us Michigan. They're going
[43:18.360 --> 43:25.000]  to deny us Pennsylvania. They're going to deny us Arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.320]  without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every
[43:31.320 --> 43:37.560]  single one of them. So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system. Tucker Carlson said
[43:37.560 --> 43:41.400]  this better last night than anything else. Communications are the reason why we didn't
[43:41.400 --> 43:47.640]  well. That's why infowars.com is so damn important. That's why they're so desperate to take you off
[43:47.640 --> 43:54.120]  the air, Alex. People need to get behind info wars. This alternative media that we work so hard
[43:54.120 --> 43:59.000]  to bring you is vitally important. We need more of this communications, not less.
[44:00.600 --> 44:07.240]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere
[44:07.960 --> 44:13.240]  to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world. We are engaging the
[44:13.240 --> 44:19.240]  globalist at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've
[44:19.240 --> 44:24.840]  persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you have the
[44:24.840 --> 44:31.400]  success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war you've ever had.
[44:31.400 --> 44:38.360]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today it's more important than
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.840]  ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been
[44:42.840 --> 44:49.640]  carrying out and to intensify it. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to
[44:49.640 --> 44:54.680]  intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening. The
[44:54.680 --> 44:58.040]  fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[45:00.600 --> 45:07.240]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere
[45:07.240 --> 45:13.240]  to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world. We are engaging the
[45:13.240 --> 45:19.240]  globalist at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've
[45:19.240 --> 45:24.760]  persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you've had the
[45:24.760 --> 45:31.400]  success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war you've ever had.
[45:31.400 --> 45:38.360]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than
[45:38.360 --> 45:42.840]  ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been
[45:42.840 --> 45:49.400]  carrying out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you and I beg you
[45:49.400 --> 45:54.520]  to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[45:54.520 --> 45:58.040]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[45:58.040 --> 46:04.120]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[46:05.400 --> 46:12.520]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[46:12.520 --> 46:18.360]  with silencing us. They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed. It's
[46:18.360 --> 46:24.040]  came over and all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[46:24.040 --> 46:29.720]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech. That's why when
[46:29.720 --> 46:35.320]  you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com it changes the
[46:35.320 --> 46:41.160]  world and that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products that empower you and your
[46:41.160 --> 46:46.440]  body and your immune system and that of your family you're also empowering the tip of the spear in
[46:46.440 --> 46:52.520]  the fight against the globalist. The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts
[46:52.520 --> 46:55.960]  at infowars.com. God bless and thank you all for your support.
[47:22.520 --> 47:37.800]  When I get up here on air and I explain these people want to depopulate you they want to kill
[47:37.800 --> 47:43.000]  you they've all said it themselves and I wish this wasn't the case I wish this wasn't real
[47:44.120 --> 47:49.800]  but I have serious discussions with my father my mother my wife and my older children
[47:49.800 --> 47:57.400]  on a weekly basis about do they stand with me staying on air and trying to stop this
[47:57.400 --> 48:01.720]  and believing in you and betting on you that we can mobilize and organize and let the globalists
[48:01.720 --> 48:05.400]  know we're aware of your plans we understand your operations and you're going to be held
[48:05.400 --> 48:11.240]  accountable when you do this. Now I wasn't just saying that this last few years I said it before
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.280]  they launched the COVID attack and I specifically said they're going to release a new hybrid virus
[48:16.280 --> 48:21.240]  a chimeric virus out of China that'll be the pretext for testing their world government
[48:22.360 --> 48:28.520]  medical biomedical tyranny control grid and then once they think that's successful if it is
[48:28.520 --> 48:33.640]  successful and it's not been totally successful they've had some big problems if it is successful
[48:33.640 --> 48:39.400]  we have passed the test that we will accept a real attack that's 50 times worse than what you just saw
[48:39.400 --> 48:46.680]  so I want to explain something they they are locked and loaded to release super weapons
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.560]  and kill the majority of us if they think they can organize it and have us stay in our houses
[48:51.560 --> 48:58.280]  and basically slowly die guarantee and I don't care if you're an FBI agent I don't care if you're a
[48:58.280 --> 49:03.240]  federal judge I don't care if you're a talk show host I don't care if you're a school teacher a
[49:03.240 --> 49:12.040]  factory worker a farmer an auto mechanic a masseuse a psychologist you are not immune from the new
[49:12.040 --> 49:21.240]  world order in this attack and you better take it serious now the Bilderberg group the club of Rome
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.680]  the UN the rain corporation the Rockefeller Foundation they've all written countless white
[49:26.680 --> 49:34.360]  papers that we've covered it on air and made films about in some cases decades ago about
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.800]  how they're going to roll this out and how they're going to carry this out against us
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.800]  so that's how I was able to predict we'd get to this point is because they're following a plan
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.120]  and they treat us like we're dumb animals but they're noticing we're not dumb animals
[49:50.120 --> 49:57.640]  and so they are very specific how they would use a virus to bring in a world ID
[49:58.760 --> 50:04.920]  under a vaccine passport that would be the foundation or the platform or the skeleton
[50:06.440 --> 50:10.520]  of the global social credit score that tracks controls everything you do the global carbon
[50:10.520 --> 50:17.080]  tax and that once they bankrupt everybody the universal basic income to fully control you
[50:17.080 --> 50:22.040]  and make sure you're not self-sufficient and so I don't have one clip I don't have five clips
[50:22.040 --> 50:29.480]  I have dozens of clips the last 48 hours of world leaders saying we're rolling out a global
[50:29.480 --> 50:38.040]  carbon tax based on the vaccine passport and a social credit score it's all the same thing
[50:38.040 --> 50:45.960]  and it is hell on earth that they are deploying so I want to go through some of these clips but
[50:45.960 --> 50:50.680]  remember while they're announcing these that they're quote global government summit look on screen
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.040]  the adl southern probably law center that run the big tech companies response are saying it
[50:56.040 --> 51:02.600]  doesn't exist look out if you share this you can get in trouble there is no emerging totalitarian
[51:02.600 --> 51:09.880]  world government so they're announcing world government they're announcing you'll have to have
[51:09.880 --> 51:14.200]  this ID or this face scan to buy or sell and you'll have to behave the way they want you to or you
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.920]  won't have the right to even leave your house but that's not authoritarian no you're right that's
[51:18.920 --> 51:25.960]  totalitarian which means maximum control even worse than authoritarian
[51:28.200 --> 51:31.480]  so here's some of the headlines the bank of england is officially announced
[51:32.120 --> 51:37.560]  you will have a digital id to buy and sell and new digital currencies now i'm going to play a clip
[51:37.560 --> 51:46.600]  of the head of the imf in a moment saying oh the central banks will lose power if they don't bring
[51:46.600 --> 51:57.720]  out the digital central bank currencies and here is in indonesia the individual that runs
[51:57.720 --> 52:03.800]  the government banking system and the health minister both on stage talking about it here it is
[52:03.800 --> 52:13.800]  so let's have a digital health certificate acknowledged by who if you have been vaccinated
[52:13.800 --> 52:20.680]  or tested properly then you can move around so for the next pandemic instead of stopping the
[52:20.680 --> 52:28.360]  movement of the people 100 with clock the economy globally you know you can still provide some
[52:28.360 --> 52:36.360]  movement of the people indonesia has achieved g20 country has agreed to have this digital certificate
[52:36.360 --> 52:43.640]  using who standard and we will submit into the next the world health assembly in janiva as the
[52:43.640 --> 52:50.040]  revision to international health regulation so hopefully for the next pandemic we can still
[52:50.040 --> 52:55.960]  see some movement of the people some movement of the goods and movement of the economy so this
[52:55.960 --> 53:00.600]  has already been announced and prepared and is ready and is all set up but now they're telling
[53:00.600 --> 53:07.080]  the general public the slaves what's happening here is european central bank had christine look grand
[53:09.240 --> 53:14.040]  explaining that this is all about power and control here it is where do we stand
[53:14.040 --> 53:19.720]  we central bankers we have been operating as a monetary anchor in relation to the commercial
[53:19.720 --> 53:25.720]  banks and the private money if we are not in that game if we are not involved in experimenting
[53:25.720 --> 53:35.320]  in innovating in terms of digital central bank money we risk losing the role of anchor that we
[53:35.320 --> 53:42.360]  have played for many many decades and we have historical examples of period where the central
[53:42.360 --> 53:50.200]  bank monetary anchor was not there and that precipitated crisis after crisis that certainly
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.160]  was the case at the time of the free banking in the 19th century do we want to go back to those
[53:55.160 --> 54:00.680]  days probably not i would say certainly not from our vantage point as a result of which we have to
[54:00.680 --> 54:06.280]  respond to the demand for those digital payment in order to maintain the role of anchor that we
[54:06.280 --> 54:12.040]  have been playing regularly that's christine legard head of the european union central bank
[54:12.040 --> 54:18.120]  former head of the imf all the same group they're the ones instituting the crisis they're the ones
[54:18.120 --> 54:22.680]  that ran the fdx they're the ones creating the crises but she says give us more power and we'll
[54:22.680 --> 54:28.840]  stop future crises that's called being held hostage now here's catherine austin fits he used to run
[54:31.080 --> 54:36.600]  the head the HUD department for the clinton's and is a major whistleblower explaining what a
[54:36.600 --> 54:44.440]  european central bank or us central bank digital currency is what is a cb dc here she is the central
[54:44.440 --> 54:53.080]  bank digital currencies how do they work so it's a digital currency and an all digital system that
[54:53.080 --> 55:00.120]  can be controlled centrally so for example we saw during covet nineteen there were rules saying you
[55:00.120 --> 55:05.560]  couldn't travel more than a certain amount of miles from your house right so there's certain
[55:05.560 --> 55:12.280]  behaviors you couldn't do this is a digital system where the central bankers and in very
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.160]  centralized ways can make rules about what you can and cannot do with your money and they can
[55:17.160 --> 55:24.440]  enforce the rules with total surveillance so this is not a currency you know so it's called
[55:24.440 --> 55:30.120]  it's central bank digital currency cb dc but it's not a currency it's a control system final
[55:30.120 --> 55:35.320]  question i have for you uh before i attack our next guest here is the moment that you say something
[55:35.320 --> 55:39.400]  that's true that goes against the narrative people to go yeah well who's this person you know what's
[55:39.400 --> 55:43.640]  her background what's his background could you maybe share with us just a brief kind of succinct
[55:44.200 --> 55:51.160]  self bio so people out there know that you are in fact a credible source so i was uh i have an
[55:51.160 --> 55:57.720]  mba from the warren school at the university of pennsylvania i was on wall street for 11 years i was
[55:57.720 --> 56:02.440]  a managing director and partner at the border directors of dillon reed company i then became
[56:02.440 --> 56:08.520]  assistant secretary of housing in the first bush administration i tried to stop the housing bubble
[56:08.520 --> 56:13.880]  and as a result got into 11 year litigation with the department of justice upon which i learned a
[56:13.880 --> 56:19.800]  great deal about enforcement the courts in america and then i started the salieri report uh
[56:20.520 --> 56:25.800]  disgusted with corporate media and i published something uh we published many things you can
[56:25.800 --> 56:30.600]  find it at salieri dot com and salieri investment so she's a great lady but the point is this has
[56:30.600 --> 56:35.560]  all been announced this is all happening we just showed you them saying we'll control when you can
[56:35.560 --> 56:40.440]  move around where you can go what you can do it isn't coming it's here ladies and gentlemen

[57:00.840 --> 57:07.880]  to them no they get this in place hell on earth will will ensue and the bible says at some point
[57:07.880 --> 57:13.000]  they will take over but it's our job to oppose it and fight it now or god is not going to recognize

[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.080]  the third difference which we see in the force industry revolution
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:21.160]  is the fact that the winners take it all contrary to the previous industrial revolutions
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:31.960]  it's very difficult to copy so if you are first move you are the winners and this will determine
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:39.480]  global competition on a national but on the on the business level to a large extent and i hope
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:47.080]  in a not too hostile way in the coming years it really is true in a social Darwinistic
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:55.400]  fashion that is we present all this that's very accurate and documented and the general public
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:01.960]  does not rally and awaken and say no and bring the perpetrators to justice that really they've
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.320]  all been given ample warning and deserve what they get and that's why the globalist target
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:13.560]  adults with deadly shots and assisted suicide and all the rest of it because metaphysically in
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.120]  the natural law of the universe if you can get somebody to hurt themselves out of their free
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:25.080]  will even if you pretty much trick them you still gotta give them a hint then it doesn't come back
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:33.000]  on you metaphysically as bad and what will happen to politics in your country in 20 years
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.440]  is when somebody in San Francisco or in Beijing knows the entire medical and personal history
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.640]  of every politician every judge and every journalist in your country including all
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.800]  those sexual escapades all their mental weaknesses and all their corrupt dealings
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:04.200]  will it still be an independent country or will it become a data colony when you have
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:11.320]  enough data you don't need to send soldiers in order to control a country so they're definitely
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:16.600]  involved in a spiritual alchemy and they understand the laws of the universe but when they cross the
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:22.760]  rubicon of trying to euthanize children trying to sterilize children trying to wreck the brains
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:32.680]  of children it it commits an interdimensional crime that god will not put up with and will destroy us
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.360]  originally it was pericarditis and i was then told just before christmas actually this is
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.600]  perimarcaditis so it's actually worse because i've got you know pericarditis and the mercaditis
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.400]  damage so i have scarring on three parts of my heart and still the delining the muscle of my heart
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.880]  i've got the information which constricts it that's when my heart rate goes up that's what's
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.880]  constricting my heart and stopping me from breathing and the other team we're finding knows that
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.080]  and that's why they try to get us to go along and sanction the killing of children whether it be
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:13.800]  abortion uh or assisted suicide or transgenderism as a form of genetic suicide for the people that
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:24.680]  actually get sterilized and so they're trying to get us to lower our shields ourselves the depopulationists
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:34.440]  dream a 3d printed suicide machine or in other words a modern day gas chamber the sarco capsule
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:40.040]  a high-tech death machine explicitly built for killing yourself was just 3d printed the sarco
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:46.680]  capsule is being touted by depopulationists as a way to efficiently and effortlessly kill oneself
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.560]  amir farsud has applied for medically assisted dying known as maid he lives in constant agony
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.760]  due to a back injury but has started the process for end of life because his rooming house is up

[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:10.360]  will have to start the fatal process themselves they will have to press a button which will reduce
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:18.600]  internal oxygen levels the pod which is biodegradable can then be detached to be used as a coffin when a
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.480]  canadian veteran picked up the phone and called veterans affairs canada to get treatment for his
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.960]  combat related ptsd and a traumatic brain injury he expected help getting better and getting his
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:36.920]  life back instead he got an unexpected and unwanted offer to help him end it through medically assisted
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.880]  death this is all being done by design well the globalists say they're destroying the country

[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:29.640]  three nine all right let's shift gears now to the power of the people whether it's a school board
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.560]  or whether it's a city council or whether it's a state legislature or whether it's a demonstration
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.520]  in washington the most effective place for the average person to get past the sensors
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.920]  and to reach tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands if not millions or tens of millions of
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:48.280]  people as matt baker's done is to go to these events that's why in the last year and a half
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:54.600]  the fbi went to the school boards and said call us in a secret document we want to come intimidate
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.000]  people not to come to these events because it's hurting us too politically if conservatives
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.640]  or populist or nationalist ever figure it out and actually go take back peacefully their counties
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:13.080]  their cities their states their school boards their zoning boards are key that's where janitor 2030 is
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:20.440]  coming through if that happens and if people realize how easy it is to take over your local
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:25.640]  governments because what we're promoting is common sense and popular and and based on common sense
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:32.040]  it's game over and so if you go to your city council and maybe a thousand people are there or
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.480]  and and maybe ten thousand see it on the local tv station that's a big win but most people that go
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:42.200]  give a good speech reach a hundred thousand and a lot of people every day i can keep track of it
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.280]  i'll see dozens of videos like i've been looking of a half million here two million there a million
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.240]  here three hundred thousand there with people just going black white ispanic asian old young gay
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.720]  straight saying i don't want force mask i don't want force injections i don't want open borders
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.480]  i don't want the value dollars i don't want fentanyl i don't want the new world order i don't
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:07.080]  want claus Schwab i don't want election fraud when you simply do that everybody else already
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:12.760]  feels like you they get mobilized they get inspired and the weakest link in the new world
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:19.240]  order's offense the the missing patch of scales on smog's belly where we can get the truth the
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.800]  sword into his heart is local governments while the globalists teach their people
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:31.720]  think global act local well we should think local think individual and think humanity and we should
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:38.520]  take over the local now that's their cheek in the armor and so we've got some of the greatest hits
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.840]  of matt baker coming up but as we go to break i want to go ahead and play a clip of him in front
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:54.520]  of the maricopa board they're talking about election fraud here it is good morning once again the eyes

[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:15.800]  called vapors they associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather of course it wasn't the
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:21.960]  cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:30.360]  d3 you see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3 but if you're not getting enough

[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:05.720]  In Arizona I think we watched the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.200]  mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:18.440]  when we we just it's election month Alex it's not election day and that's the problem
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:25.480]  and everything changed after COVID-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:31.000]  ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people well this
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.880]  isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.720]  like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.480]  problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us that
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:54.120]  question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:19:00.360]  they are we're not election deniers we're election realists I am extremely honored
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:07.080]  to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy I am blessed to know that our information
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:14.840]  is so hardcore but the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us they know of the
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:20.760]  truth about their globalist operations is exposed it's game over and all over the planet humanity
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:27.160]  is awakening and peacefully fighting back and our main tool is free speech and the truth we
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.880]  promote using free speech that's why when you share articles and videos from bandot video

[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.240]  remember back then it seemed like the lockdown would never end and they were invincible now
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.880]  they're asking for amnesty we're not giving them amnesty till they all face nirnberg trial
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:48.600]  2.0 here it is we'll go to matt himself that's the wind that's the wind of time
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:57.320]  that's the wind of history that's the wind blowing through your ancestors bones begging you to do
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:10.440]  the right thing sir that is the wind that matt baker is calling upon from ocean beach
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:16.120]  to wind that is blowing through the black people through the white people through the chinese
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:22.120]  people through the mexican americans to the people that built this building with their bare hands
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:29.720]  to raise up this nation they are begging you and they are blowing through your veins and they should
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:35.800]  be putting a tangle up the spine of your back and they should be begging you to do the right thing
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:44.200]  you're about to open a pit of hell you do not get a vaccine passport put on us you know as the
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:50.920]  population who's in control you know that the people or the politicians once you get a power
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:57.640]  you will never relinquish it do you think that the four feet of marble that holds you above
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:05.560]  high in this chamber will help you from the fate of humanity which you are unleashing
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:16.520]  no it won't your children and your children's children will be subjugated and will be asked
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:25.400]  how many vaccines have you had? Have you been a good little Nazi? Hail Fauci! Hail Fauci!
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:34.360]  Hail Fauci! Hail Fauci! There's been a lot of talk about the Nuremberg Code! Well I brought to
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:44.680]  a copy you are all in violation of section one yes you doctor will done you are in violation
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:56.120]  of the Nuremberg Code which is international law and the the definition is the definition we shall
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:05.240]  not be first all of this is coercion the vaccine passport is coercion and the penalty for violating
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:15.800]  the Nuremberg Code is violating the orientation the meeting please take a seat please take a seat
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.720]  Matt Baker joins us the rest of the hour Matt I tell you what a time to be alive absolute
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.800]  Nuremberg violation the ADLC will be an award to Pfizer for their Joseph Mingola activity
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.440]  they should create the official Joseph Mingola appreciation award I mean it's not even a joke
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:39.000]  these people are sick Matt Baker your view on the stone election the whole world with the rest
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:47.480]  of the hour God bless you brother your real inspiration are we up yes sir you're up so
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.760]  so just what do you want to tackle first I felt like I was going out to a break there so no no
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:59.720]  I'm bad about that I'm bad about that the winds of change are with us brother well they are you
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:06.440]  know I went to this other school board no city council meeting that is the board of supervisors
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:12.520]  that is I want to know who is it that creates the talking points for the board of supervisors because
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:19.720]  the board of supervisors out here in Arizona is almost an exact clone replica of the board of
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:25.160]  supervisors that is in San Diego they have the same exact talking points they have the same exact
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:31.000]  agendas they're all new world order it's all agenda 23 into 21 and it's all implemented by the by
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.800]  Davos yeah I want to know who it is that's giving these guys their talking points you need to go
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:43.640]  to your local board of supervisors and find out what they're up to because it can guarantee you
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.480]  it's not good these people pass every single thing that's on their agenda they'll have a
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:55.080]  supposedly right leaning person and a supposedly left leaning person and they'll put things on the
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:02.520]  agenda and literally every single thing they put on the agenda they go okay anybody against no okay
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:09.240]  and the agenda passes literally to a T every single time it just goes just a train of tyranny
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:13.880]  that just rolls right through all of our towns and we don't even know we don't even realize what's
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:20.040]  going on with it you know I think we should get some biodegradable bullets you know because that
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:26.440]  that would be really helpful in this situation you know I'm just kidding well expanding on that
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:32.520]  what you get is a central issue whether whether we're in Australia or the US or Canada or Europe
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.840]  it doesn't matter it's the same new world order agenda the same talking points the same program
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.600]  it is man and you got to get out there you got to be part of it you can't listen to people who say
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.720]  there's nothing we can do you know look at look at the ripple effect that just a person like
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:53.960]  I cause or Alex Stein you know I got to give props to Alex Stein he's so hard working he kind of
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:26:02.680]  inspired me to to continue on and to find avenues and things that you can do be like a lightning rod
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.040]  for the things that are happening and changing so you become the path of least resistance
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:13.960]  and you raise your hand up and lightning strikes you God moves through you because you're the path
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:20.040]  of least resistance and that's what needs to happen and while we are channeling that energy
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.680]  and while we are becoming the path of least resistance we need to use that energy to resist
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:33.080]  the new world order we have to put friction on what they're doing I was joking with Owen the other
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:40.760]  day that it's like Klaus Schwab is penetrating your cabinet and what you need to do is put a little
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:47.080]  friction and don't lubricate it for good old Klaus Schwab in the new world order we need to stop
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:54.520]  these people at every point at every place everywhere every time and all the time and that's
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:59.880]  what we have to do and if I and Alex Stein can make these giant ripples just imagine if there
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:06.280]  was thousands of us or millions of us if every single person on planet earth would just simply
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.880]  gain that warrior spirit and just everyone just said nope we're not doing that all in unison
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.440]  all at the same time this we wouldn't even be having this conversation we'd be down at the
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:23.480]  river having a beer and looking at the fish jump but no we're not because everybody wants to be
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.320]  a slave and they want to give in and they want to relax and they want to say there's nothing
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:33.080]  we can do trust the plan well don't trust the plan you are the plan you are the plan you are
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:43.480]  the motion you need to move get off your ass go out there and engage the system everything they do
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:47.640]  is about getting the individual to not engage to believe your back is broken we've gotten
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:52.040]  pentagon documents that's hijacked by the globalist it's all about breaking the individual's will
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.960]  and making you think you don't have power but because we do have the power we absolutely do
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:03.880]  we have the power humanity has the power and if anyone has put that out there it is you the great
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.800]  alex johnson i love you man i uh when i saw you in studio i gave you that big hug and uh

[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.800]  on board and man this ship hopefully to a brighter horizon absolutely stay right there let's talk about
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:49.000]  the election fraud ukraine the war the world government all of it with matt banker trade

[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.960]  paper ballots and they're done in a day why can't we do this here the answer is fraud and corruption
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:14.600]  if we don't fix the system it doesn't matter whether republican nominees donald trump or

[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:24.200]  matt maker and the winds of change the tyrants know the winds of change are here that's why they're
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:30.760]  trying to circumvent that with a great reset with a new world order i just asked matt during the break
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:35.480]  coming up the next segment if he had five minutes to address people on national tv or state of the
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:39.640]  union what would he say it's gonna two minutes in the city council please don't think about that
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.880]  he's gonna give us that analysis or rant or however it comes out next segment but but matt
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.520]  with the stolen election with them claiming missile attacks by russia they met her frauds
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.880]  all of this the system gets more and more desperate you've got
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.520]  chan pin giving us oscar does elen's key is a joke you've got kordeaux and the new puppet
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.760]  promissory of england like little schoolgirls calling up as elen's key i mean it's just the
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:08.440]  whole thing just reeks of failure these people really are a joke let me ask you a question alex
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:15.000]  do you think that uh the war in ukraine do you think that russia is really fighting with the
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.360]  ukraine in the west or do you believe that it is part of the global reset where they're actually
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:27.080]  using it as a smoke screen for shutting off pipelines and different things like that they
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:32.840]  basically have the cover to say oh this pipeline got shut down and then then they can shut down a
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:38.280]  pipeline and america be like oh russia shut down a pipeline then well we have to bomb russia's
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.000]  pipeline because they've shut down our pipeline and basically you can just slit the throat of all
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.520]  of this infrastructure and blame it on the conflict or do you actually believe that um
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:56.440]  latimer putin is in an existential battle for the life of russia well there's no doubt that the
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.760]  global has precipitated this in the last nine years and push russia in this position i know
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.560]  putin's involved with the global so many levels but i think the slovak civil war has been going on
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.040]  for hundreds of years i think it's very very real at the end of the day but it's definitely being
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.800]  used as a smoke screen for the great reset in the words of the globalists themselves
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:23.320]  exactly because when you know back to claus schwaab he says um well uh young global leaders like
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:29.720]  vladimir putin and vladimir sotodo so i mean they're said in the same sentence and you see what's
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:35.320]  going on in the world and you basically see what the narratives are on the tv and they're been
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:43.000]  you know created by truto and vladimir putin and claus schwaab's just behind the scenes
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:49.720]  you know petting his cat like a super villain it's uh it makes you wonder you know uh who's
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:55.640]  actually you know is there any real people on the on the board or are they all being part of the
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.840]  game i mean i know you've said before you know you start thinking everything's a conspiracy but
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.920]  you know at a certain point when you see all these players and they're all part of the world
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.720]  economic forum i mean you do start scratching your head and start wondering you know how much of this
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:15.880]  is is actually going on like are we really having a threat for a nuclear war or is nuclear war just
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:19.800]  going to happen whether they want well i think that's a very good question to ask if you pull back
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.640]  you've got three predator stakes the anglo-american establishment the russians and the communist
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.360]  chinese and so they all agree at certain levels for power and control and technocracy but they're
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:34.840]  also fighting with each other over the ring of power so i think it's it's it's both right
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:39.240]  right and it kind of brings me to trump because i know um oh yeah what's your take on trump
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:46.040]  announcing disdain us all of it well you know obviously i i'm like everyone else i've really
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:53.160]  liked what disantis has been doing and you know like you say judging a tree by its fruits i like
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.400]  the fruit that's coming off disantis but you know that apparently behind the scenes there's a lot of
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.520]  weird stuff going on with him that you know makes you wonder if he's not also a plant or someone
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:09.240]  there to take the wind out of trump's sails but um i just wonder you know i i really would like to
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:15.480]  back trump i i backed him i voted for him twice but like you said i mean this whole vaccine thing
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:21.640]  really is kind of a deal breaker and it's like uh i want to know i really want trump to come out
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:28.040]  and just say i was tricked because when he says it's his idea he loves it it's the greatest thing
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:34.360]  in the world and when he keeps going on with that when q people try to say that the pandemic never
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:38.920]  would have ended if we didn't have the vaccine well that's not true if if you just acted like
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.720]  florid and said we're not doing a lockdown we're not doing mask mandates then it would have ended
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:49.160]  with the simple just say no campaign like chris scott had going on and even when they had the
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:54.120]  vaccine that didn't count they're like well you need two vaccines we need two vaccines and a mask
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.040]  you need two vaccines and two masks you get a boost you need a mask so it's basically whatever
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:05.000]  they say it is it is and then you're allowed to move like they say you're allowed to move
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.520]  who that makes my blood boil when they say stuff so let me ask you this who got leveled you think
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:14.600]  humanity's winning right now or is the anti-human force winning and what do you see coming in the
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:21.880]  near future who well i definitely see that we are in the the battle of the yin and yang right now
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:28.200]  and obviously as the evil does rise uh you know the lord lifts up the standard as you always say
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:34.120]  i feel like the reign of tyranny is bringing the mushrooms and the mycilia of the liberty
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.040]  caps we're popping up and we're growing like i wouldn't exist if it wasn't for all this
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:45.080]  tyranny coming along you know i i was just going about my life like i i didn't want to be you know
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:49.560]  i wasn't in this to be a freedom fighter it's just you look around you look at the world and
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.280]  and you're just amazed that nobody else wants to stand up and it's like so it's like if i have to
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:58.760]  be the one to say uh the emperor is not wearing any clothes and then everyone's like oh yeah who's
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:04.360]  gonna say that it's like well just fucking say it sorry you know but you're right i mean it's a
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:10.600]  wizard of Oz toto we've all got to be toto and pull back to curtain so are we winning i mean we're
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:16.280]  alive and and you're on the air and i'm on the air so i think um we can never take anything for grand
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.880]  and there's more of us every day the more they try to censor there's always new amazing uh people
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:28.120]  of every race color and creed popping up to support liberty it's beautiful yeah i i think every breath
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:33.720]  we take is a victory because we know where the the new world order wants us they want us in these
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:40.520]  biodegradable death chamber coffins you know you got to love their little acronisms made
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:47.400]  medically assisted suicide death made and you can be in a biodegradable coffin and then you can
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:55.000]  biodegradably help the world and it's like man i just want to biodegrad them oh no but oh no oh
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.800]  there's too many of us but they have to stay they have to be in charge they're the guardians
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:05.640]  they're gonna save us by killing us yeah i've got a great idea for all the uh the global warming
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:11.240]  people you know it's it's it's not a new idea i think it's probably been done before i say
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:17.400]  we build a megalith let's say a pyramid we build it down in south america and everybody can kill
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.000]  themselves and they'll get their little uh name you know carved into the pyramid and that will be
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.880]  the pyramid of life and they can just all you know say they killed themselves for the earth you know
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.320]  it's a great idea and uh they'll be carved in there for for all time on their beautiful pyramid
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:40.360]  of death like i said it's it's not a new idea uh like i said instead of rambling uh yeah every breath
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:48.760]  you take is a victory every word you speak is a victory every moment of life is a victory
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:54.520]  and is it the victory we want to see obviously you know you and i would love to be living in a lot
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.720]  for your world but it's that yin and yang and we're here to uh to be the liberty and they're here
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:06.680]  to be the tyranny and as long as we're here we're winning you're absolutely right and we've had so
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.680]  much freedom for so long and allowed this evil to grow because we weren't valuing freedom we're
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:16.920]  down going to the process of valuing freedom again yeah it's true man it's like uh the average
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.360]  american has just had it too good too long they just really can't get it through their skull
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:28.120]  that there's a possibility of tyranny happening in america they really just don't get it they just
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.080]  can't see it they just can't see it coming it's like literally a knife about to chop their neck
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.000]  and it's like no that can't happen i'm in america that doesn't happen and it's like
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:44.200]  so it's time for everybody to realize and and live in the real world and and watch what's going on
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:51.240]  and listen to these globalists like alex does and realize and take them at their work when they say
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.160]  well there's too many people on the planet why don't you take my vaccine and people can actually
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:03.720]  listen to bill gates and think he has your best interest at heart when he literally says he wants
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:12.520]  you gone and he's got a vaccine for you i mean people have got to be just so uh so silly so stupid
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:18.680]  so mind controlled the the it's just amazing let me let me shift topics here for one second
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:24.520]  talking about raising liberty and the fact that you're here and the fact that i'm here um frank
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:29.160]  have an arm michael grade so you're playing his song we're actually creating this thing called
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:36.120]  the american liberty awards and we're going to celebrate all of those liberty um warriors out
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:42.760]  there for example there is an award called the alex jones lifetime achievement award and there is a
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:47.960]  owens shroyer man on the street award and uh we're gonna stay there i want to hear about this and i
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:53.560]  want to get your five minutes live not suppressed not being screamed at not being told to shut up by
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:43:00.600]  these city councils your address the world mad beggar in arizona i think we watched the election
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:08.600]  be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:15.720]  for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's not election
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:23.000]  day and that's the problem and everything changed after covet nineteen they illegally changed state
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:30.040]  elections mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:34.680]  well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.360]  can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.120]  and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:52.600]  us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections um
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:57.080]  shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.880]  the tip of the spear throughout this entire process the only thing that made any republican
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.480]  victories tonight possible the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.760]  the only thing that made any uh opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:20.760]  shutdowns and and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible it made any resistance
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:27.160]  to it possible was people continuing to support info wars despite the massive lawfare being waged
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:33.640]  against info wars despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against info wars the ordinary
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.400]  people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier and wiser

[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:34.920]  all right and then we've got the economist joining us who predicted so many other big
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:39.560]  events and he's saying a lot of critical things about the economy in the future of america
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.360]  martin armstrong is really hard to get on he's going to be joining us coming up in the next
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.680]  hour but but matt beggar you got cut off i want you to have your five minutes or longer here if
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.000]  you're addressed the world where you're not having people yell at you or city councils or
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.480]  legislatures trying to shut you down or school boards but but you you were getting the liberty
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:02.200]  awards i mean i agree that we shouldn't lionize patriots we should just support them because
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.600]  they're a representation of us but we should celebrate victory and liberty so i didn't want
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:12.280]  to interrupt you but we had to take that hard break go ahead well i mean i don't know i think
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.480]  we should lionize them you know people have asked and i've had arguments with people like is chris
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:24.200]  sky a hero is alex jones a hero i'm sorry to say you might not want to hear it but the fact is you're
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:32.760]  a hero alex and uh in this world we need heroes and uh well there's no doubt the globalist target
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.880]  populist leaders that they see as folk heroes all i'm saying is this is the right thing to do i
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.040]  don't see it as heroic to try to survive and fight tyranny but i hear you in a world of a sleep
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:48.040]  people those that are awake i guess are heroes all i'm saying is is that you know the military that
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:53.320]  lose their jobs or firefighters not taking the shot they're a hero for what they've done i mean i i
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.720]  get what you're saying but when the enemy attacks our leaders we should rally behind them i think
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:03.640]  that's what you're saying yeah i just simply think that you know let's you know people who make the
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:08.680]  greatest liberty song of the year should be out there we should say man this guy really kicked us
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.680]  you know this is the greatest liberty cut comedian of this year this is the greatest man on the street
[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:20.200]  this is the greatest person who stood in front of the tank at tenement square even if the person's
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:24.680]  dead we can give them a possible no i agree the person at tenement square who reportedly did get
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:31.560]  tortured to death that's a real hero right there julina saansh you know julina saansh is a nine
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:37.960]  year solitary confinement platinum hero he is a hero exactly here's the thing matt i don't want to
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:42.120]  put myself in that category and i don't want to get the category being a political prisoner being
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:47.640]  killed then i'll be a hero i'm just doing what i need to do now because i hate tyranny but exactly
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:53.320]  but but but let me say brother people like you who are inspired to take action are my heroes but
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:58.200]  continue well i'm sorry alex i'm just i'm just you're just not going to beat me on this point
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.840]  you're a hero sorry that's it and just this is the way it is i know you don't like it but it's
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:09.560]  a reality anyway instead of making sports heroes or you know some girl who takes her top off and
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:18.040]  dances around being your hero you know or politicians like nancy pelosi is your hero no we need to get
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:25.800]  our priorities straight we need to realize what is good and at this point in the game you know
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:31.240]  our greatest people are the ones that are willing to say no they're willing to stand up that are
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:38.680]  willing to hold back the mind control that we're all under we are under such heavy mind control
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:46.120]  as a species we have to have people that are capable of breaking it we have to say this person
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.840]  can see through the matrix no tell me we should have also awards for people that break their
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:55.320]  conditioning like they broke the mind control they broke the conditioning award that should be the
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:01.960]  biggest award is someone new that broke free absolutely i i think that's a great idea you know
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:07.720]  like uh what's her name that uh the democrat lady who uh just switched over so she never no longer
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:13.800]  exactly talsy cavern sorry i forgot her name she's awesome you know the uh the the waking up from
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:21.480]  the mind control we have to realize everything is mind control the currency is thought the currency
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:27.400]  constantly they talk about money power control votes it's all the same thing it's all control
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:34.040]  it's all the currency of mind and when they're controlling your mind they own you and so they
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:39.720]  can pay you money to own you and make you work or they can convince you through propaganda
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:45.400]  to own you or they can pay someone and freedom is the currency of human success and empowerment
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:52.120]  exactly liberty coin i know you don't want to do it but honestly i wish there was not just the
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:57.080]  silver dollars i i know you hate crypto and i do too but no i don't hate crypto it's a great
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:01.960]  technology it's just it's so dangerous because it gets manipulated yeah i just wish there was
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:08.360]  an actual liberty-based coin like actually you make let's say a million i totally agree let's
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:12.040]  get into that in the last five minute little segment the next hour before armstrong joins us
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.600]  but now we're coming down to six minutes to break so matt beggar if you're not being interrupted
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.360]  by the city councils or county commissions and you've got five six minutes to really

[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.920]  our interfacing loving a sunset or loving our children or loving our wives or husbands loving
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:24.680]  our family loving goodness is communion with god the creative universe and they want us to hate
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:30.680]  ourselves and not believe in that and realize that our very existence is magic and our very free
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:36.600]  will is what god gave us and we must come together and realize that and that if we individually change
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:41.080]  our hearts and souls that will at a cellular level change the body politic and that's where
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.880]  the answer is that's why they dump cultural poison and evil on us to turn us against each other
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:51.000]  because they're afraid of humans that are just millimeters from inheriting this great destiny

[02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:37.400]  You told me every television in London cruelty and injustice
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:43.840]  And where once you had the freedom to object to the thing can speak as you saw fit
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.560]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:53.060]  How did this happen who's to blame
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:58.360]  Certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:04.560]  But again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:05.600]  I
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:12.320]  Know why you did it. I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease

[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:25.360]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high Chancellor Adam Sattler
[02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:35.800]  He promised you border. He promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:41.520]  There is a war it's happening now
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:46.600]  It will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:54.920]  We are the resistance. We are the info war
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:10.680]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex Jones
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:14.840]  All right, I've been following his work for 20 years
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:20.360]  Martin Armstrong is an economist and a dinner stock market expert. I'm not gonna go over his whole bio
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:28.200]  We take an hour Armstrong economics dot com ask dot dash
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:37.880]  Socrates dot com ask dash socrates dot com and he has been for several years here on air predicting exactly what we're going through now
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:43.640]  So I would ask him to cut to the chase with what he's predicting is about to happen and then walk through the mechanics of all of that
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:50.200]  Because we need to be ready for what is taking place a major political realignment a major economic realignment
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.640]  Taking place on the planet a Klaus Schwab two days ago
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:09:00.280]  G20 saying America's power is over. I mean they are really setting us up for a fall
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:05.800]  So mr. Armstrong great to have you with us here today. Thank you so much for joining us
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:07.800]  Well, thank you for inviting me Alex
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.800]  So I'm gonna try to give you the floor for most of the hour
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:13.800]  You want to give us the big picture first and walk through it or you want to start with the
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:17.720]  The technicals and give us the answer. How do you want to start here?
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:24.440]  Well, I think that you know people have to understand what is actually taking place here
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:31.160]  Because a lot of it is just propaganda that that tends to try to distract people
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:36.120]  Um, I mean for years, you know, I've been basically on the opposite side of
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:41.080]  of Schwab and in meetings for a long time and
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:49.480]  The reason people are these governments are are lining up with Schwab is because we have a
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.200]  A sovereign debt crisis and that's what's taking place
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.080]  Now
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:01.960]  Um, we've been borrowing since world war two with no intention of ever paying anything back
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:06.600]  And the real crisis here that is developing
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:14.920]  Is that what Yellen came out and was saying that oh, maybe the Treasury should step in and start buying
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.560]  Long-term debt etc
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.080]  And the reason
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:23.080]  Is that the amount of new debt that came out over cove?
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.320]  It exploded and now you have this ukrainian war
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.480]  And what she's really concerned about
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.520]  Is that we have surpassed the
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.120]  ability of
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:42.440]  Basically and the primary dealers to even buy the debt
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.280]  And people have to understand that the u.s. Government
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:49.720]  Traditionally never sold the debt itself
[02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:52.760]  It went to the bankers and the bankers of the ones that sold it
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:54.760]  so
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:00.360]  To be a primary dealer you have to get on the list and you have to guarantee to buy x amount
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.760]  And the problem is is that as we saw in uk
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:14.760]  You know, you can't imagine the losses that pension funds have have endured that, you know, they've had long-term bonds
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.760]  and
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:18.760]  You know, they've had long-term bonds
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.720]  And you know the eu was issuing debt negative in 2014
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.880]  So all of a sudden you have interest rates soaring to four percent
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:32.840]  The value of those bonds is just it has been collapsing
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.240]  so
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:38.120]  What yellen was talking about some people miss
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:46.040]  Interpreted it and saying that oh, she's competing with the federal reserve and that's not true
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:49.640]  The fed creates the money the treasury does not
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:52.280]  she was talking about
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:56.120]  Buying in long-term debt and swapping it for short term
[02:11:56.600 --> 02:12:00.120]  In other words that interest rates have been going up so much
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:06.200]  That what's happened is is that the bond market itself has been collapsing
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:09.240]  That was the real problem in the uk
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:12.040]  And so she recognizes
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:18.520]  a two-fold problem here one is that as interest rates are going up nobody wants the long term
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:20.840]  They lose too much money
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:23.480]  And two you have the primary dealers
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:28.360]  Are choking on the debt because if they have to buy it to keep their franchise
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:35.000]  But can't sell it then you're looking at taking down the banks that you know let goldman and all the primary dealers
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:42.360]  So they were largely complaining and that's why she came out and was talking about swapping the debt
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:46.600]  And what Schwab has been tapping into
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.040]  is that these governments know that
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:55.480]  The jig is up if they can't sell the long-term debt
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.480]  You know they can no longer continue to fund
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.720]  of their
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.600]  Relations and so what you're looking at is a real debt crisis
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:09.640]  And they've been using this
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.440]  uh, ukrainian war
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:16.280]  They they needed distraction. I mean covet was one
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:21.320]  But honestly they ended up, uh, you know exploding the debt
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:24.760]  Uh all around the world
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:27.560]  And now they can't really fund it
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:33.960]  And as interest rates go up the interest expenditures on the government explode
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:40.920]  So, you know people have to understand that you know Keynesian economics was formed in the great depression
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:47.480]  And when you know he came up with an idea the united states had a balanced budget
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.720]  so, you know
[02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:55.480]  He basically said that's when the government should enter a deficit
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.880]  Because the demand in the private sector is contracting
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:07.240]  And to ease the economy the government spending should increase the compensate for the contraction in private
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:10.040]  Now the problem was once you
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:18.520]  Uh told the government that gee they can actually spend you know, you know in and go into deficit
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:23.160]  Our politicians have done it year after year after year
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.000]  So in all fairness, I mean they they never really
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.480]  They took one
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:37.160]  Sentence from Keynes and ignore the rest of it. Keynes also said, you know, you can stimulate the economy by lowering
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:44.760]  Uh taxes, you know, they you know, they go into convulsions if if you ever suggest such a thing
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:49.240]  I mean how dare we we always need more and uh, so
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:54.200]  You know for 40 some years. I've been dealing with governments and
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:59.560]  Our political system, I think is collapsing
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:04.360]  Largely because nobody will ever address anything long term
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:09.720]  When I've been in meetings and I said listen, we can't continue this borrowing
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:12.120]  indefinitely
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:15.800]  And they would respond. Yes, but we're different. We're the government
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.840]  Uh thinking that somebody will always buy their debt and secondly that
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:23.880]  They've always said well
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:30.440]  You know, you're talking about something that may hit in 20 years. I won't be here then so that would be somebody else's problem
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:35.000]  Uh, stay there. We gotta go to break martin armstrong famous economists amazing at predicting things
[02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:38.120]  We've seen senators and house members say though, we have unlimited money
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.920]  Government can never run out of money, but we're now coming to that point. How does this thing break?
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.720]  What do you see unfolding and when you talk about?
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:49.720]  The end of america the end of the dollar and more with martin armstrong
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:54.760]  Alex Jones stay with us info wars.com tomorrow's news today armstrong economics.com
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.040]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:09.080]  Believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapers
[02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:13.560]  They associated these poisonous vapers with cold weather
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:17.960]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.960]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.200]  You see the sun
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:28.040]  Via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:32.040]  But if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:36.680]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:41.640]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin d3

[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:09.160]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories. We've broken together
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:11.480]  This family that is info wars
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:18.840]  Think about how info wars is cited by joe rogan and tucker carlson and balcenaro and other foreign leaders
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.160]  like nigel farage
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.160]  as being the main impetus
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:27.720]  Towards firing up their main base to defeat the new world order
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:31.800]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:37.960]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.840]  I don't take the credit

[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:39.560]  for covet post covet vaccine injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary care

[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:01.560]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:09.000]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:14.040]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:18.680]  So they're going to go from michael indel next or are they going to go for steve bannon or are they going to go for tucker carlson
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:21.640]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:25.880]  And I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a modern paul revere
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.160]  But I couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.320]  Not just america where public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda
[02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:40.840]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars has been because of your past support
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:44.680]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now the critical juncture of the battle

[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:09.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[02:20:14.600 --> 02:20:17.320]  All right one of the top economists out there
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:21.480]  We spent the whole hour about his bio. I'm not gonna do it. It's martin armstrong
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:24.680]  He has predicted everything that's happened the last 25 30 years
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:28.520]  And he's here making some really scary predictions. We're coming to an end of a cycle
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.800]  An end of a system. I have the head of the european central bank saying
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:35.960]  We're coming to an end. It's collapsing. We've got to move to a new digital currency
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:40.120]  That controls every facet of our lives and creates a new ponzi scheme with carbon taxes
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:42.520]  So you're getting into all the technicals last segment
[02:20:43.320 --> 02:20:46.520]  We need to drill back into those martin, but big picture
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:52.600]  How would you describe the world economy the different players and different groups and where we're at and what are you predicting is about to happen?
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:54.600]  Well
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:57.640]  What they've been doing is we have
[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.880]  We have an I would say another little
[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:04.280]  group that
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:09.320]  Or really have the white house in control and they're the climate change people
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:14.440]  And they are the ones that are really I'm not sure
[02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:19.160]  If they're just completely insane or they actually know what they're doing
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:28.200]  But trying to shut down fossil fuels on a global scale without alternatives already in place
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:33.400]  Is really insane and this is causing the civil unrest to rise
[02:21:33.960 --> 02:21:37.160]  And we're seeing that outside the united states first
[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:43.160]  Eventually it will get to the united states, but we're looking at probably a lot more civil unrest next year
[02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:45.880]  and we have to understand that
[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:52.360]  Our energy is priced in dollars. So as the dollar has been going up
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.040]  Uh, their energy costs have exploded
[02:21:56.760 --> 02:22:03.640]  And this is why you're seeing civil unrest in and everywhere from asia and shirlanka to pakistan
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:08.840]  Um, you know, it's it's just spreading and it will continue
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:17.000]  Uh, thanks also, you know to the covet lockdowns, etc. I mean, we just had a conference in uh in orlando
[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:21.560]  Last week and like three of our staff that wouldn't even let into the country
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:24.360]  It you know, they're stranded off in in
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:26.520]  dubai
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:28.520]  but it's just
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:30.520]  You know, this is what's happening
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.240]  The economic system
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:40.120]  Um, that we've been under with these people and the central banks are no longer able to really control anything
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:42.520]  um
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.080]  Raising interest rates to stop inflation
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:52.680]  Only makes more inflation because we're this type of an of inflation is is based upon shortages
[02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:55.400]  the covet nonsense lockdown
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:56.840]  um
[02:22:56.840 --> 02:23:00.680]  Everything that we had as far as the the supply chain
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:07.080]  Uh, and as a result, you know, by the way, this interrupts you look ahead of the european sort of bank just said yesterday
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:11.560]  They're losing control to have a central bank head saying we're losing control
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.520]  That's got to be a terrifying statement
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:21.400]  Yes, you know, this is what we saw in london. Okay that the long term
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.440]  debt nobody wants it
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.440]  you've wiped out
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:29.400]  All the pension funds in europe they're broke
[02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:33.240]  All right, you you took an interest rates to negative in
[02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:40.760]  2014 and then you also had a law saying that pension funds had to be secure and had to buy government debt
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:43.960]  I mean, they need eight percent to break even
[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:49.080]  We have, you know, as you know, you know, we're probably the largest in the world. We have
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:55.000]  clients with portfolios over a trillion dollars and we get requests
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:01.800]  Can you create a green portfolio that they just break even because they have to have green investments?
[02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:07.240]  Politically to satisfy the politicians, but they lose money on on everything
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:13.560]  I mean, it's it's an absolute insane world that we're we're looking at the scegs explain scegs
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:18.440]  Well, basically there's nothing that they can
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:22.920]  Actually make money on i mean it's uh, you
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:27.560]  You just look at germany. I mean these people are so climate
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:30.040]  insane
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:32.040]  They don't even want nuclear power
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:38.600]  I mean, uh, I think the the former head of greenpeace came out and said to aoc
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:41.880]  I mean, how are people going to get their food into the into?
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.840]  Cities horse and buggy. I mean it's gotten really insane with these people and
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:51.720]  They are looking at it
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:55.880]  Uh, saying that they have to destroy as much of our energy
[02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  Uh capacity to produce
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:05.080]  In case the other side gets back in they won't be able to rebuild it and that's really what they're trying to do
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.640]  Quantify that that's so huge because they have all the energy heads saying we're a transition
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.680]  We're destroying the old system you said quotes so the other side can't get in that is so key elaborate on that
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:18.680]  Yeah, I mean if you destroy
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:24.280]  Why most of your capacity to your ability to produce energy?
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:30.360]  All right, that's what they want. They don't want us to be able to go ever go back to fossil fuels
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:32.760]  This is really why
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.960]  Um, the west is using ukraine as cannon fodder against russia
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:40.680]  Russia's the biggest energy producer
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:44.840]  50 percent of their gdp is all is all energy
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:48.760]  It's why the u.s. You know basically took out their pipeline
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:56.520]  If you go back to syria, why did obama wanted to go into syria because katar wanted to put a pipeline through syria
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:02.120]  To cut off the supply from russia and he refused and so right away
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:06.680]  He wanted to go in and say oh they abused their people, but he lost
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:11.160]  And we you know americans are getting tired of these endless wars
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.280]  Uh, I was actually
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.640]  Went to marlar go to see trump back in march of 2020
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:23.080]  And I've met many heads of state
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:29.640]  But I will say this for all the people that don't like trump. I was actually impressed for the first time
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:38.200]  He was a world leader and he actually said that he wanted to pull the troops out of afghanistan
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:45.160]  Because he was sick and tired of writing letters to their parents and saying their son died for god in country
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.560]  And he said
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:54.600]  Point blank. He says what are we there for? They've been fighting over borders for a thousand years. What difference are we going to make?
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:59.880]  That's why bolton came out and all he has to be he's terrible president blah blah blah
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.760]  But he was the first head of state of any country that I ever encountered
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:09.400]  Whoever was concerned about the people that actually died on the battlefield
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:15.880]  Um, I mean they all want oh look. This is a war. We have to defeat russia. We should push them out
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:19.880]  How many lives is that going to cost how many children will be?
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:25.480]  You know lose their fathers and grow up as you know without you know
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:30.120]  Martin I totally agree and we got to go to break again a long second. What's coming up, but just quantify
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:34.040]  How would you describe the world economy right now?
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:39.240]  Basically, we're we're collapsing and I don't think you'll see the dollar remain
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:42.520]  Uh as a viable currency after 2028
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:48.040]  Well, you talk about they're destabilizing things swab brags. They're destabilizing things on purpose
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:51.560]  To bring in what but doesn't he know he's getting the blame now?
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:56.200]  He thinks he can do this collapse and not get the blame. Do you think things are going well for the wef?
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:02.840]  No, look, I mean Schwab I can tell you that he is a control freak
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:09.160]  This is why everything he is proposing is absolute control
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:13.160]  All right chips and people and all sorts of crazy ideas
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:20.040]  You know he look he's an academic and every academic I've ever you know encountered
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:22.840]  uh or marxists and
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:30.200]  And his view is marxism would have succeeded had they also had Europe and the united states
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.560]  So this is what they're they're pushing here
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:38.920]  One world government they think the u.n. Can basically then control everybody
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:43.320]  I mean, it's going to fail our computer shows that it's going to absolutely fail
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:47.160]  Absolutely, he isn't admitted marxist an ultra rich marxist
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:54.360]  Who believes we were all robots then his utopia would work another bureaucrat control freak martin armstrong's our guest stay with us
[02:28:57.960 --> 02:29:02.360]  Alex why is this taking so long? Why is this taking so long in france?
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:06.520]  They can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day. Why can't we do this here?
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.760]  The answer is fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:15.000]  It doesn't matter whether the republican nominees donald trump or governor de sanctimonious
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.840]  They're going to deny us michigan. They're going to deny us pennsylvania
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:25.640]  They're going to deny us arizona and I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:31.320]  Where I believe there is an america first majority in every single one of them
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:38.040]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system tucker cross and said this better last night than anything else
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:44.440]  Communications are the reason why we did well. That's why info wars.com is so damn important
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:49.880]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air. Alex people need to get behind info wars
[02:29:50.040 --> 02:29:55.240]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:59.800]  We need more of this communications. Not less. I am extremely honored
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:03.080]  To be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:07.640]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:12.760]  But the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us
[02:30:12.760 --> 02:30:16.600]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations as exposed
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:23.000]  It's came over and all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back
[02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:27.720]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech
[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:33.480]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man dot video or info wars.com or news wars.com
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:39.320]  It changes the world and that's why when you go to info wars store.com and get amazing products that empower you
[02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:43.080]  And your body and your immune system and out of your family. You're also
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:49.240]  Empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist the fight starts at info wars.com
[02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:54.920]  And the support of the fight starts at info wars store.com. God bless and thank you all for your support
[02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:00.760]  In arizona, I think we watched the election be
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:06.120]  Stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots
[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:14.280]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month
[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:23.640]  Alex, it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covid 19. They illegally changed state elections
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:29.720]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:32.040]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election
[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:37.400]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this and I believe that
[02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:42.200]  Just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that
[02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:48.600]  And it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity
[02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:51.480]  And question the the fact that elections
[02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:57.080]  Um shouldn't be run the way they are. We're not election deniers. We're election realists
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:03.800]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist
[02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:06.520]  I have come from nowhere
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:10.360]  To the very heights of politics not just in america but in the world
[02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:15.640]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:18.120]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:24.280]  I've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars are the real reason you've had the success
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:29.960]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order. You've ever had
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:36.200]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:42.360]  It's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:44.840]  And to intensify them. God bless you all
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:51.640]  I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target
[02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:57.080]  And this street is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all
[02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:04.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:21.560]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:24.920]  Armstrong economics.com
[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:31.240]  Martin Armstrong has joined us for decades. He is probably the most accurate predictor in the future
[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:37.400]  He's giving you all the the tales and facts and background, but how does this break? I mean, what are the different scenarios?
[02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:42.680]  What should the public know when we've got the head of the european central bank saying we've lost power?
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:48.280]  Everything's collapsing. Uh, you've got Schwab laughing saying once it all collapses, they'll be able to reorder it
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:52.520]  But he's getting the blame. He thought that wouldn't happen. He thought they would collapse things and then
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:57.000]  Use the crisis to get control themselves. I don't see it going that way
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:02.120]  So looking out over the horizon short term midterm long term. What does martin armstrong see?
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:06.680]  Well, we see a tremendous rise in
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:10.840]  civil unrest globally next year and
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:13.720]  it is
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:15.880]  You know, as I said Schwab is an academic
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:21.080]  He actually has a bust of Lenin on his on his bookshelf
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:24.120]  You know, this is what
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:29.480]  um, you know, this is what what he believes and and
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:35.560]  Everybody that he has there is is largely on that same agenda
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:39.160]  Uh, it's not going to work. I mean the
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:48.520]  The primary reason that communism failed is because it it attempted to make everybody just drones
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:51.240]  um, I was called in
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:59.000]  Um by china to help them actually become capitalist and it was a very interesting experience
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:02.680]  I went there and uh, effectively they
[02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:05.880]  I had to explain
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:14.200]  Very fundamental economic principles. I mean, they wanted to know like why one tea was selling at a different price someplace else
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.360]  And uh, I said first you have transportation costs
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:26.200]  And they were like, oh wow, really? I said then somebody will pay more for something that they prefer over another
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:28.120]  so
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:33.880]  You know, this is why communism fell because basically if a tea was priced at one dollar
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:39.640]  Here and a one dollar all within the other side of the country, but it cost ten dollars to get it there
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:44.040]  uh, that's why communism collapsed it and
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:48.760]  And you have these people like schwab who just are are
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:53.720]  I don't know. I mean, is there a brain dead or what but uh,
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:58.840]  They keep trying to make statements like you'll own nothing and like it and exactly
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:05.480]  The the point you make well, why is t twenty dollars here and ten dollars here because the shipping cost and where it's got to go
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:11.640]  Is more they don't even understand basic things. It is the dumbest ideology. Why does it keep taking over then?
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:13.640]  I
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:16.680]  Because you know, I don't know. I mean it's
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:26.600]  Schwab and I have been on opposite sides for decades. I mean marcus vetter came and did the movie on me the forecaster and
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:29.880]  Uh, I was funded by a german tv station
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:33.880]  Schwab then called him and said hey, I want you to do a movie on us
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.360]  So marcus filmed what is called the forum on on
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:43.320]  I mean, whatever I've done. He then tries to copy it's just
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:51.640]  It's it has been a war for for decades between us. We started our first world economic conference 1985
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:55.400]  He started his first world economic forum 1987
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:03.160]  Uh, it it's just, you know, we're on opposite sides. I mean Nigel Farage came to ours in 2019
[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:09.560]  And he said of course i'm here. He says, you know, basically armstrong is the alternative to devils
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:15.720]  I mean, that's I mean this has been a long-standing war between the two of us for a long time
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:18.360]  Uh, he's just an academic
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:23.160]  Does he know how much trouble he's in because he's probably more headed than bill gates right now
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:25.960]  I mean he is as hate as much as hitler right now
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:31.560]  Yeah, look, I mean this is the problem and he has used
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:33.560]  his influence
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:36.280]  um, and
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:38.600]  To buy time with these politicians
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.920]  And most look at what we have out there. I mean you've got Trudeau in canada. You've got
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:50.600]  um, who they call me, you know, uh, mrs. Head down in in new zealand
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:56.360]  I mean all these people he's training and mystic them in there and these various different governments
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:57.880]  um
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:01.160]  It's horrible. Absolutely horrible, but uh,
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:08.360]  Not a you know, it's a debate as to who is the worst world leader. I mean look at biden
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:14.040]  He's senile and he just reads whatever the cue cards basically say and
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:18.680]  It's who's you know, the real president is who's who's writing the cue cards
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:24.840]  So what should we look for next because you've been predicting major upheaval. It's now happening. What do you predict he comes next?
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:27.960]  Well, I think we're going to start seeing a lot of civil unrest
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:33.880]  I mean, uh, I mean, I think this is the longest time it has ever taken to
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:42.760]  Uh, even say who won an election. I mean, we've always known then that night or maybe the day after not a week later
[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:46.120]  Uh, my own staff could have wrote a program
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:52.760]  You know in less than 30 days that everybody can vote. I mean if we can buy on amazon safely
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:58.920]  Why can't we vote on the on a computer safely? What's with all these paper ballots all of a sudden?
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:05.000]  I mean, I know people in Canada that we're getting ballots mail-in ballots and they're not even american
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:07.160]  um
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.480]  Pennsylvania got caught over, you know sending out 200 000
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:16.440]  Mail-in ballots and they weren't even verified as to if they were american or not
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:23.320]  Let's switch gears. You've been really on the ukraine crisis with russia this news a false flag with a missile attempt
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.840]  Bloop in their face pun intended wet. What do you see happening there?
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:30.600]  It
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:32.600]  ukraine, I know very well
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.240]  uh, we actually have
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:38.280]  had employees from donask as well as from Kiev
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:45.000]  And I can tell you that you can't even bring a russian bottle of vodka to dinner in Kiev. It's an insult
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:50.120]  Uh, it goes back very long, you know time the hatred in that area
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:52.760]  There is no resolution
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:54.760]  Zelensky is
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.240]  Uh, nothing but propaganda basically. I mean he puts out all this stuff
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:06.200]  Adelaide university has just come out and confirmed that vast majority of all these pro
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:08.920]  ukrainian
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000]  Comments all over the place
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:12.520]  are
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:16.520]  Done by ukrainian bots. Uh, he is losing the war
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:19.160]  That's really what this is about
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.840]  my info from uh over there from the ukrainian side said that 300 000
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:30.200]  Soldiers have been injured and 100 000 ukrainian soldiers are dead
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:33.480]  Uh, and he keeps trying to pretend that
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.600]  You know, he's winning russia's going to fail and all this other kind of stuff
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  this latest
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.400]  Missile thing. I mean
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:50.200]  You know, he's refusing to it to keep saying that it's it's it's all nothing but
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:54.120]  Oh, it's russia russia russia. He and he wants to get
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:57.640]  You know, he's trying desperately to create world war three
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:01.400]  I mean, he's a very dangerous man. Uh, and
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:08.120]  Uh, it's it's unbelievable. But you know, we should not be supporting ukraine whatsoever
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:12.840]  Uh, I agree with henry kissinger. Yeah, don't ask is
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:16.120]  Historically russian territory
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:22.840]  And i'm talking about back to the bays of the czar and that's why you have russian people living there
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.280]  How do you see this ending because even there's secret us talks now?
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:28.840]  Uh, ukraine is trying to false flag
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:31.240]  What what what comes next?
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.600]  All I can hope for is that the west wakes up and
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:38.600]  And knocks off this
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.640]  Um insane, you know proxy war, which is basically what it is
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:45.960]  um
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:51.720]  But unfortunately, I think we're going into world war three and it's probably going to hit after
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:55.800]  or in 2025 going into maybe 27
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:59.720]  and because we do the same thing with, uh,
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:01.720]  taiwan
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:04.920]  He sent policy over there just before the
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:11.400]  The the communist convention. I mean, that's like yes, you better give you know, uh
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:14.600]  She you know absolute control
[02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:19.640]  I mean, why would you do that just ahead of that? Of course that that supported him
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:25.400]  Uh, you know, it's I don't know who's making these decisions in washington
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:31.320]  But they seem to be intentionally trying to make the world far worse than rather than better
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:38.360]  Exactly stay there stay there martin armstrong armstrong economics.com. I want to try to you cover any other big topics you want
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:41.560]  I've got a lot of questions, but you're smarter than about economics. What's happening?
[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:46.600]  What is your advice to the american people of the world about the time and place we're in right now final segment

[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:11.000]  Why can't we do this here? The answer is fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system

[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:09.160]  Believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:13.640]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:21.080]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people what was killing people was a lack of vitamin
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:23.640]  D3 you see the sun
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:28.120]  Via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:32.120]  But if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:36.760]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things that start replicating and taking your body over

[02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:13.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:20.680]  The plot to seize russia
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:25.880]  The top economist i mean i've been following this stuff for 30 years at a mom for 20
[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:31.160]  Only a couple times here should get him one more option. He's hard to get on martin armstrong armstrong economics.com
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:33.640]  During the break i said
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:34.840]  Mr. Armstrong
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:40.840]  Condense all your predictions and warnings into this segment and can we stop world war three and he said probably not
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:45.240]  They need it the globalist need it as a smoke screen with a great research
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:51.480]  So sir give us that knowledge and talk about your new book and and and where this is all going. Well
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:57.640]  Their theory is is to create a new brinton woods
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:05.000]  And to get out of all the debt they will default on it and that's why schwaab is saying
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:07.480]  You'll own nothing and be happy
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:11.640]  He's trying to make it sound that you're the one in trouble not them
[02:48:11.640 --> 02:48:15.480]  And that they will relieve you of all your debts
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:24.200]  And they're being generous in helping you when in fact it's their debts that they're going to default on but that wipes out all the pension funds
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:27.480]  So security is a hundred percent u.s. government debt
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:30.600]  and so
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:32.280]  They think that
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:36.200]  using the war that that will be the justification
[02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:40.200]  To create another britain woods after world war two
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:42.200]  And then they get to reestablish
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:47.400]  Everything and for 40 years in governments that i've been talking to
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:50.920]  Their view is that they are not the problem we are
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:58.120]  And that if you found a hundred dollar bill on the parking lot you cheated them out of their 50 dollars, you know their share
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:05.720]  Uh, it's you know, they never consider anything whatsoever about you know themselves
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:14.040]  That you know, as i've said, there's no mirrors in washington. So it's always about us and we do not comply with what they want to do
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:16.360]  And that's why they want the digital currencies
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.800]  Because if i gave you a hundred dollars, that's fine. They don't know where i got it from
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:27.560]  But if it's a digital currency, they know where i even got it from and can follow it all the way down the line
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:30.920]  So, i mean, this is all getting to be
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:33.000]  um
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:36.680]  You know very draconian, but i mean this is their objective
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:43.800]  And that's what schwab is really saying with the great reset and he has sold this idea to governments
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:45.800]  as a whole
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:48.520]  as their way to escape from the debt crisis
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:55.080]  And it's just going to be a complete mess and then he thinks he can recreate things
[02:49:55.720 --> 02:49:56.920]  Uh, and
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:58.920]  You can't i mean
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:04.520]  Uh, the reason we became the biggest in the world was because we did foreign exchange
[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:12.760]  All right, we were the first ever to do anything like that and when we were going to open an office in 1985 i had you know, um
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:15.480]  Launched with one of the top
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:18.040]  bankers of uh in switzerland
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:20.600]  And i had a list of you of
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:23.640]  Farm and foreign names, you know european advisors, whatever
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:26.360]  and he said name one
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:35.240]  European analyst and i was embarrassed because i couldn't and he said there are none because after world war two every politician used
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:40.360]  The the rise in the currency from zero to prove that he did a good job
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:47.160]  So no bank analysts would ever come out and say oh the dutch mark's going to go down that was you know political
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:52.360]  So we became the biggest and he says because you don't care if the dollar goes up or down
[02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:54.520]  I said it's just a trade to me. That's it
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:59.400]  Um, so that's how we became so big. It was just simply
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:04.040]  Our you know foreign exchange was our you know our real forte
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:10.280]  And you have to understand that that's why all the governments called us in for this that the other thing
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:11.640]  I mean it was
[02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:16.760]  You know, I got called in for the creating the g5 back in 85 87 crash
[02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:22.680]  Uh, you know, they I was friends with margaret thatcher's kept the pound out of their euro
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:27.240]  When they tried to get it in that blew up and soros became famous
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:32.840]  I mean all these things i've been in the middle of and it's always been foreign exchange
[02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:34.920]  It's been the the primary
[02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:38.520]  Issue and when they were creating the euro they came to us
[02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:42.040]  I told them if they don't consolidate the debts, it's going to collapse
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:46.760]  And they said look we just have to get the euro in first and we're worried about the debt
[02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:48.760]  And now they admit so what's the first to collapse?
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:53.480]  Is it the euro? Is it china? Because the rubles weigh up. I mean, what's the most?
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:57.240]  Is it the dollar? I mean, how do you see this? I know it's hard to make a prediction, but
[02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:02.120]  The dollar's to last the fall because it's going to be like world war one and two
[02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:04.760]  All the money comes here
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:09.160]  All right, because you're you know, you got tanks going down the streets blowing up things
[02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:12.360]  That's what the strength in the dollar has been
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:15.080]  Uh, it's been capital inflows
[02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:17.880]  A u.s. share market as well
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:26.040]  I mean pay attention to the dow versus for example the nasdaq nasdaq is retail domestic the dow is
[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:28.520]  Is the big money from international?
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:34.840]  Uh, it's like when the japanese came over buying real estate, you know, what do they they bought all the trophies?
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:40.120]  You know rock a fella center, etc. They don't buy mom and pop houses down the street from you
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:50.040]  Uh, so it's you know the the dow represents big international capital and first you have the concentration of capital into the united states
[02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:52.680]  from europe and asia
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:57.880]  And then eventually, you know as all these countries start defaulting on their debt
[02:52:58.120 --> 02:53:00.840]  They're going to turn and say well the u.s. Has got to be next
[02:53:01.640 --> 02:53:03.640]  So the u.s. Will be the last to fall
[02:53:03.640 --> 02:53:09.960]  And and you know, that's why they got biden in there because he'll sign basically anything that that
[02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:14.120]  And as you said, they're getting ready to the euro to be the first big one to drop
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:17.560]  But they want a big bailout with their with their, uh
[02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:20.680]  Marshall fund 2.0
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:26.040]  Pretty much. Yes. I mean you have zealinski over there who's
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:29.560]  Telling, uh, he was he got biden man
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:35.000]  He's basically saying he wants the u.s. To cover all their pensions. We don't even cover ours
[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:36.600]  um
[02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:40.360]  I mean, it's you know, it's it the whole thing is falling apart
[02:53:40.920 --> 02:53:44.520]  Uh, how does how does ftx going belly up tie to this?
[02:53:46.920 --> 02:53:53.080]  Then you know, they were basically funding they were the second largest donator to to the democrats
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:57.560]  He was basically funding the fake studies, uh for covid
[02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:00.440]  And uh, it you know, it's
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:06.760]  He just bought his way into into the democrats and it's thinking that he could you know buy protection
[02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:11.560]  But you know, they lost so much with the collapse in digital currencies
[02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:13.800]  uh that
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:20.120]  You know, it's you know, there goes. I mean and and you're getting a contagion now in in other areas
[02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:25.320]  Uh, so the the good old fashioned things is basically, you know cash
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:30.280]  So metals things of that nature and you keep them in your drawer for right now, but um
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:32.040]  us dollars
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:36.760]  I should point out that 70 of the dollars circulate outside the country
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:43.640]  Because the u.s. Has been the only country that doesn't cancel cancel its currency whereas britain cancels it
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:49.160]  You have a 10 pound note from from 20 years ago. They're worthless. Uh, the same thing in in europe
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:55.560]  I mean they cancel currencies routinely canada passed the law and he canceled all the high currencies
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:54:58.520]  Uh in january, uh, so
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:04.440]  This is you know, the u.s. Is is the dollar has been the reserve currency
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:12.360]  And it's also been used primarily outside the country. I mean dollars are circulating tremendously in russia
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:15.560]  So in closing and I really appreciate your time other big predictions
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:22.040]  Uh, politically in america the the war in russia. Just just quick quick synopsis again
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:26.440]  Well, it you know, this is an election that nobody's going to accept
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:33.480]  Uh, and it's our computer warned that it was probably the most, you know corrupt collection election
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:35.560]  I think in in american history
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:37.800]  but uh
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:41.400]  It really calls in the question. What's going to happen in 2024?
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:45.640]  And I I'm not necessarily sure we're even going to have a
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:49.320]  A viable election at that point. I mean, it's
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:55.400]  Like stalin said, you know, anybody can vote whoever they want, but it's the those account
[02:55:55.400 --> 02:55:59.800]  They're the ones that decide the election and you know, he wasn't so far off
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:05.800]  Uh, you know, you have to understand that we're probably still in a very steep recession
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:07.880]  um
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:10.600]  Interest rates are still going to rise into next year
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:13.400]  So you're looking at mortgage rates going up
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:16.600]  I wouldn't pay off mortgages if you have them at low rates
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:22.600]  I would you know, basically keep it because that's the risk you've sold to somebody else and um
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:27.800]  I would definitely make sure you have a supply of some food
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:32.680]  Because the supply chain has been really seriously disrupted
[02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:34.840]  um
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:42.440]  Energy, I mean you should have at least some sort of a backup if possible because these people are trying to shut down
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:48.440]  The entire power grids really with with what they're doing and they don't even understand
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:53.560]  I mean, you had biden as soon as he came in the first thing he did was cut off the pipeline from canada
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.000]  Uh, then he outlaws all drilling yet
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.280]  Then he goes over to sort of arabia before the election and please don't cut off anything before the election
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:09.640]  We don't care what you do afterwards. Uh, but you know, these people are completely insane if if everybody had
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:16.760]  Electric cars the power grid the most conservative estimate. I've ever seen it has to be 400
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:19.240]  Times larger than what it is now
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:22.520]  Uh, incredibly incredibly said. I know you've got to go
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:25.000]  But if you could do five more minutes a two minute break

[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:34.280]  They are insane. They're collapsing things. They admit they want to post industrial world, but they're going to get to blame
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:40.360]  How do we stop them from completely collapsing things and they get new leadership and stop this because that's the that's the big question

[02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:55.080]  In arizona, I think we watched the election be uh stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots
[02:58:55.560 --> 02:59:03.240]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we we just it's election month
[02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:12.600]  alex it's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after covet 19 they illegally changed state elections
[02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:18.680]  Uh mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[02:59:18.920 --> 02:59:20.920]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.680]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this
[02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:31.160]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that
[02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:38.760]  And it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the
[02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:41.240]  the fact that elections
[02:59:41.240 --> 02:59:45.960]  Um shouldn't be run the way they are. We're not election deniers. We're election realists
[02:59:48.840 --> 02:59:54.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:00:02.760 --> 03:00:04.760]  The plot to seize russia
[03:00:06.600 --> 03:00:08.600]  We have the author on with us
[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:11.720]  Art and arm strong right now for five more minutes
[03:00:12.280 --> 03:00:19.240]  Talk about your book that is coming out as we speak at arm through economics.com. We available everywhere here very very soon
[03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:21.320]  Tell us about the book
[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:27.880]  Uh, well, basically, uh, I was in the middle of all this stuff, but I in order to do the book
[03:00:28.680 --> 03:00:34.360]  Uh, I've got a hold of all the declassified documents from the clinton administration
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:39.320]  Which effectively I've used throughout the whole book. We're giving you even the letters
[03:00:39.960 --> 03:00:44.360]  Uh transcripts from phone calls of yeltsin to clinton
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:50.280]  Uh, everything they've been saying about russia and poutine is just basically all a lie
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:57.880]  And what what shocking even to me was that in when ussr failed
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:02.760]  In 1991 nato went to russia and said
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:05.400]  Uh, okay fine. You can join
[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:13.000]  And that's why there was a coup against gorbachev because the the communists there saw that as as
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:16.760]  a surrender of russia to the united states
[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:19.400]  uh, so, uh
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:22.760]  I think we can probably maybe do another show on that one, but
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:27.480]  What I wanted to say before, you know, we we shut down is that
[03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:32.840]  We're not going to be able to stop these people from basically destroying the world
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:38.760]  But what will happen is is that we're looking at separatist movements again
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:41.640]  so you're looking at
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:43.480]  United states
[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:48.680]  Separating this is like the fall of rome. Uh, and and you're going to see you're
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:51.400]  Separating you're you're already seeing
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:58.680]  Uh, countries, you know disputing, you know, each other and one policy doesn't fit all the centralized government fails
[03:01:59.400 --> 03:02:01.400]  That's why you know the ussr
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:06.280]  You know collapsed and united states is is so polarized
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:08.280]  politically
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:11.800]  That we can know, you know, we're not going to be able to survive it as a
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:14.760]  Uh an entire country anymore
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:23.480]  The civilization is created when everybody benefits. You can't stand up and start calling them names. You're you're deplorables
[03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:25.800]  and it has become so
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:33.720]  Uh polarized in the country that you've destroyed the very foundation of the united states
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:36.280]  uh, and and
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:43.560]  The same thing with poudin. I mean they they're out there. Oh, he's a war criminal. He says, how do you then negotiate even peace?
[03:02:43.560 --> 03:02:50.040]  I mean, you know, you're you're insulting the head of the state. He's not even going to the g20
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:52.760]  I can tell you that
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:56.200]  I have people inside the icc. We were very upset
[03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:01.880]  And the international criminal court, they want to indict him. They've never indicted a
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:04.680]  head of state
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:08.280]  For you know war crimes. I mean, this is absurd. It's all political
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:11.720]  But once you do that, there is no negotiation
[03:03:11.720 --> 03:03:14.440]  There you're not coming back from this
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:20.200]  So, I mean you're and they just tried to missile false flag to blow up in their face
[03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:26.200]  Yeah, I mean look, this is this is you know, we're in the end game here. They're desperate
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:34.040]  Uh, they're trying to create world war three to distract us from the the fault on the sovereign sovereign debt default
[03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:40.520]  I mean, it doesn't work anymore. This is what you know, what's collapsing in front of our eyes
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:44.520]  And it's been fiscal mismanagement since world war two
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:52.920]  You know and people have to realize that they they look at us as basically stupid
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:57.880]  I was in australia and they were passing the luxury tax
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:04.680]  And the slogan was we're going to get all those basic rich people who have their their french wines
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:11.080]  Their fur coats and their ferrari's and everybody cheered. Yeah, go get them. And what was in it all electrical products
[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:13.640]  You bought a radio a phone
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:16.760]  Radio it was a tax on the working class
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:23.480]  Yeah, I mean, it's always that way because there aren't that many people. I mean it
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:27.320]  There aren't a lot of risk people all these taxes are on poor people
[03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:33.320]  Yeah, that's basically what happens. I mean, there's only 600 some of you know
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:40.840]  A billionaires in the country, but you need 87,000, you know armed irs agents

[03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:21.240]  When in fact it was ukraine all along that fired the missile and they knew from the very start that it was them
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:28.280]  Zelensky of course doubling down and still claiming that it wasn't ukraine. Well, he's finally being forced to
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:31.480]  Slink away with his tail between his legs

[03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:31.800]  Illegal immigrants. They get on a coach. They get given free cash
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:38.440]  They get given free health care when it's virtually impossible to get an appointment during winter with the nhs
[03:11:39.240 --> 03:11:45.480]  Because it's the envy of the world apparently if you're an illegal immigrant coming on on a boat from france free health care
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:48.280]  And of course free hotel accommodation
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:52.280]  Now it started with rinky dink crappy hotels on the edge of
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  Basically s-hole towns
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:57.880]  Then it moved up to four star accommodation
[03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:06.440]  Then it moved up to hotels located in prime tourist areas in the middle of towns giving out free hotel rooms to these legals
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:14.520]  Now they're putting them in or planning to put them on luxury cruise ships and in five star hotels
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:19.400]  And these are the problems that are generated by that in the uk
[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:29.000]  Headliner of remix news asylum seeker accused of rape in uk has gone missing after being moved from one migrant hotel to another
[03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:30.200]  whoops
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:32.200]  Who he's vanished into thin air?
[03:12:33.320 --> 03:12:39.720]  An asylum seeker was subject to police bail conditions after being accused of rape. He raped a boy by the way
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:42.920]  Bringing his wondrous culture over from
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:45.720]  His home country
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:53.000]  Has gone missing after uk authorities failed to securely transfer him from one hotel to another
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:58.760]  This was the 39 year old suspect who was staying at an asylum center in london
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:04.120]  An attack took place on october 5th during which he raped a young boy
[03:13:05.160 --> 03:13:09.960]  Then of course the opposition shadow labor and p dian abut came out and basically said
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:17.320]  The reason he raped the young boy in asylum center in london was because people on the right were being mean to migrants
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:19.400]  That was the true culprit of it all
[03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:26.280]  Well now after he was transferred to another hotel accommodation in buckingham about 125 kilometers away
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:34.120]  The suspect should have been escorted by police to the new hotel, but he wasn't he was just told to go there on his own
[03:13:34.120 --> 03:13:42.280]  A literal rapist set to go to trial now. He's whereabouts are unknown. He's gone missing. No one knows where he is
[03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:46.760]  Of course almost every day now on the south coast of england
[03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:52.840]  Dover in those areas we have illegal boat migrants arriving on dinghies
[03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:59.880]  There are so many coming now that the border force the charity leftist refugees welcome NGOs
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:02.360]  Can't even rescue them all
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:06.520]  Can't even intercept them all and in many cases they just rock up on the shores
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:13.160]  Get off their dinghies and run off into the local town. No one knows who they are. They could be anyone
[03:14:13.160 --> 03:14:15.960]  They could be rapist. They could be criminals. They could be terrorists
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:23.720]  We recall of course before the Paris massacre and afterwards the isis jihadists that carried out the Paris massacre bragging
[03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:30.200]  In their own publications. We were able to slip into europe on fake syrian passports
[03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:34.440]  By pretending to be refugees. This could be happening
[03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:41.880]  The next massacre could be being planned right now as a result of these people coming in because our border is completely porous
[03:14:42.040 --> 03:14:44.040]  It's like swiss cheese
[03:14:44.520 --> 03:14:46.520]  Now we have rapists going missing
[03:14:47.160 --> 03:14:49.640]  We have locals in the towns where they come ashore
[03:14:50.120 --> 03:14:53.720]  Arming themselves with weapons now whatever weapons they can get their hands on
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:57.720]  Because in some cases these migrants have broken into their homes
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:02.760]  That doesn't seem to faze refugees welcome activists though. We have this headline again out of remix news
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:08.600]  UK refugee charity calls for ban on naming migrant hotels. Yes, the real problem
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:12.200]  Isn't the migrants themselves hanging around in one case?
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:15.560]  A high school in standish near wigan
[03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:21.720]  Filming the pe lessons sexually harassing 12 year old girls as they walk home from school
[03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:28.600]  Another migrant in that hotel raping a 37 year old woman on the street at night. No, that's not the problem
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:30.920]  The problem is the british public
[03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:37.720]  Knowing the name of the hotel where these migrants are being held now the refugee council in the uk
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:42.440]  Has called on the government not to disclose the names of those hotels to the general public
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:49.480]  Citing safety concerns. So that's the biggest safety concern not naming the hotels. Forget about the rapes forget about the rapes
[03:15:49.480 --> 03:15:52.680]  Forget about the rampant criminality summit dot news. We'll be back
[03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:56.360]  Look around you
[03:15:56.520 --> 03:16:00.920]  Everything I predicted from the globalist own documents from their own admissions is now happening
[03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:04.760]  Info wars credibility my credibility has never been higher
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:13.400]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[03:16:13.400 --> 03:16:14.520]  Stay on air
[03:16:14.520 --> 03:16:19.560]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:22.120]  So I want to ask all of you today
[03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:24.280]  To help keep me on the air
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:27.560]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations
[03:16:27.720 --> 03:16:33.880]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40 of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:36.920]  It's unsustainable. So please visit

[03:16:52.920 --> 03:16:59.160]  Thank you for your support wouldn't be without you save info wars.com in Arizona. I think we watched the election be
[03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:04.520]  Stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:09.640]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:13.240]  When we we just it's election month Alex
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:22.040]  It's not election day and that's the problem and everything changed after COVID-19. They illegally changed state elections
[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:28.120]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:30.440]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:34.200]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:40.600]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that
[03:17:40.920 --> 03:17:47.000]  And it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity
[03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:49.880]  And question the the fact that elections
[03:17:50.440 --> 03:17:55.400]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are. We're not election deniers. We're election realists
[03:17:56.600 --> 03:17:59.720]  I'm dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:02.760]  to introduce to you the wellness company

[03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:15.800]  healthcare systems this new online

[03:18:56.840 --> 03:18:58.840]  I am extremely honored
[03:18:58.840 --> 03:19:01.640]  To be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy
[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:06.200]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:11.400]  But the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:15.240]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed
[03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:17.640]  It's came over and all over the planet
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:21.560]  humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back
[03:19:22.200 --> 03:19:26.360]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech

[03:19:57.560 --> 03:20:03.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[03:20:03.560 --> 03:20:20.760]  Live from the summit dot news headquarters, it's paul joseph watson
[03:20:24.760 --> 03:20:29.320]  Now again, i've said it before i don't really blame these migrants for wanting to come here
[03:20:29.320 --> 03:20:33.240]  They come from in many cases backwards countries rife with
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:35.880]  Criminality poverty and violence
[03:20:36.520 --> 03:20:38.360]  But again, the problem is
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:42.760]  All of them coming here bar a few and the media always for example
[03:20:42.760 --> 03:20:46.200]  There was a newspaper front cover a couple of weeks ago where they found
[03:20:46.840 --> 03:20:52.360]  The one child staying at this migrant processing center and of course that ends up on the front page
[03:20:53.080 --> 03:20:57.080]  In fact, the photographers tell you if you go down to these asylum centers
[03:20:57.080 --> 03:21:01.960]  They could take pictures all day of these fighting age young men coming into these facilities
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:11.480]  There's no point because the newspapers don't want to buy those photos of those overwhelmingly 98 percent young men coming into these facilities
[03:21:11.480 --> 03:21:16.440]  They want the one photo of the mother and child and that's what they put on the front cover
[03:21:16.680 --> 03:21:21.640]  Which is why the british public has a completely skewed perception of all of this
[03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:27.240]  But again, you get these men 70 80 sometimes 150
[03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:34.440]  Moving into a migrant center sometimes in small villages comprised of less than a thousand population
[03:21:34.760 --> 03:21:38.520]  And they don't do anything. They just hang around the streets all day
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:42.600]  And it causes problems loitering harassment
[03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:48.440]  Criminality and of course if you live in a certain area and you've known a certain life
[03:21:48.440 --> 03:21:57.400]  For generations in some cases, if you suddenly get 150 young men from afghanistan, iran, albania
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:22:01.240]  Moving into a facility around the corner from where you live
[03:22:01.480 --> 03:22:07.800]  That's going to change your village. It's going to change your town. It's going to make the streets more dangerous
[03:22:08.200 --> 03:22:10.200]  In Kilkenny in Ireland
[03:22:10.440 --> 03:22:12.440]  They had a population of 10,000
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:16.600]  And 3,000 migrants moved in
[03:22:16.600 --> 03:22:19.960]  It was plus almost a third in a matter of months
[03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:27.080]  Now the complain into the local newspaper about not feeling safe on the streets. It happens everywhere
[03:22:27.480 --> 03:22:35.480]  And this refugee council has got the gall to say make it illegal to name the hotels in which these migrants are being housed
[03:22:35.960 --> 03:22:37.960]  Because one nutcase in Dover
[03:22:38.600 --> 03:22:44.040]  Through a petrol bomb at the outside of a building didn't kill anyone didn't hurt anyone
[03:22:44.040 --> 03:22:50.680]  Ended up killing himself. He was mentally ill. The police came out and said it had nothing to do with political extremism
[03:22:51.240 --> 03:22:54.200]  But now we can't even know the names of the hotels
[03:22:55.160 --> 03:22:58.760]  Well in one case a hotel owner is refusing the government
[03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:05.960]  The government's offering him a million pounds to have his hotel full of asylum seekers
[03:23:07.160 --> 03:23:09.160]  100 occupancy
[03:23:09.160 --> 03:23:11.160]  For at least 12 months
[03:23:11.160 --> 03:23:16.360]  Bear in mind many of these hotels are on the verge of going out of business because lockdown almost ruined them
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:22.760]  So many of them have to take the money from the government and they get 100 occupancy for 12 months
[03:23:23.480 --> 03:23:31.880]  There's barely any occupancy at the moment in November where it's pissing down with rain every day and four degrees Celsius in England
[03:23:32.920 --> 03:23:34.920]  So why not take the government money?
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:41.560]  Well to his credit one hotelier in the uk has rejected the offer
[03:23:42.680 --> 03:23:47.480]  Hotelier refuses one million offer from home office to house asylum seekers
[03:23:48.840 --> 03:23:53.480]  This is Richard Martin who owns the three-star blazing donkey country hotel in sandwich Kent
[03:23:54.200 --> 03:23:59.960]  He's been offered a million again for 100 occupancy. He said he couldn't think of anything more absurd
[03:23:59.960 --> 03:24:06.680]  We spent 30 years building up the business, but money doesn't come into it. He says our reputation would shatter
[03:24:07.320 --> 03:24:12.920]  overnight and why is that because in some cases they've had migrants staying these hotels with tourists staying
[03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:18.120]  in the same hotels at the same time tripadvisorbooking.com review score plummets
[03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:23.400]  And of course they get a bad reputation from the local community because this causes crime and violence
[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:29.080]  I'm going to come back to talk more about this, but let's hit this first video first because apparently there's a solution to all this
[03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:31.800]  from Rishi Sunak the British prime minister
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:37.320]  Not really a solution more of a bandaid. This is called that ain't it chief. Let's roll it
[03:24:37.880 --> 03:24:45.720]  Prime minister Rishi Sunak has unveiled his miraculous solution to the boat migrant crisis with almost a thousand illegal migrants arriving on
[03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:50.840]  British shores every single day and then being given a free taxi service on shore free cash
[03:24:51.080 --> 03:24:57.960]  free high-end hotel accommodation and free health care more migrants arrived today on this boat and just ran off into the local town
[03:24:57.960 --> 03:25:01.080]  But Rishi says he has the answer paying France
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:06.840]  63 million pounds so they can increase the number of police officers patrolling beaches in France
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:13.400]  Eh, no that ain't it chief. We already paid him 54 million quid last year. What did that achieve?
[03:25:13.480 --> 03:25:17.480]  What's throwing an extra seven million quid at the problem really going to accomplish?
[03:25:17.560 --> 03:25:23.320]  I mean, yeah, it may stop a few hundred more crossings per day, but they're still going to be coming at almost the same rate
[03:25:23.480 --> 03:25:27.560]  That isn't a solution. It's a bandaid ripped off at a moment's notice
[03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:31.480]  What motivation does France have for keeping sometimes dangerous
[03:25:31.800 --> 03:25:38.680]  Illegal migrants in their country. They already have massive problems on their own soil caused by runaway mass migration
[03:25:38.920 --> 03:25:44.680]  So why would they want to exacerbate that and given that this is what they were confronted with at Dunkirk over the weekend?
[03:25:44.680 --> 03:25:52.280]  Or French police really motivated to have to deal with these individuals
[03:25:52.440 --> 03:25:57.960]  Or are they more likely to just let them sail off to jolly old England and have us deal with them instead?
[03:25:57.960 --> 03:26:04.200]  France is already demanding Italy except boatloads of migrants that arrive on Italian territory on French ships
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:08.040]  Relying on them to stop boats coming to England is a fool's errand
[03:26:08.040 --> 03:26:12.200]  The only way to stop the boats from coming to England is to stop them from coming to England
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:18.360]  The only way to stop the boats from coming is to disincentivise the journeys in the first place
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:23.960]  By getting out of the European Court of Human Rights and then replacing it with a British Bill of Rights
[03:26:23.960 --> 03:26:32.680]  That actually gives us control over our own borders without leaving a loophole to be exploited by malevolent NGOs and human rights campaigners
[03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:35.240]  Then follow Australia's example
[03:26:35.240 --> 03:26:40.840]  They held asylum seekers on neutral territory and then processed their claims at a snails pace
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:48.440]  Result? Legions of economic migrants who knew they couldn't get immediate access to the country didn't even bother trying
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:51.240]  There's no migrant crisis affecting Australia now
[03:26:51.240 --> 03:26:54.280]  They solved it so let's copy their methods
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:59.880]  Paying the French to ensure our border security is like paying criminals to guard other prisoners
[03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:02.680]  They're just gonna take the money and let the prisoners out anyway
[03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:07.160]  And do you really believe that Rishi Sunak is that bothered about mass migration?
[03:27:07.160 --> 03:27:13.000]  Given he's already planning to introduce a new growth visa which will ensure millions more will arrive anyway
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:19.480]  If that scheme's introduced it'll probably end up making the numbers arriving in boats look like a trickle compared to a deluge
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:24.120]  The Tories have already proven themselves completely untrustworthy when it comes to immigration
[03:27:24.120 --> 03:27:29.800]  That's why polls show a new party led by Nigel Farage could attract over a quarter of UK voters
[03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:36.360]  38% of conservative voters would seriously consider switching their allegiance to a new Farage-led party
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:42.520]  62% said they want a quote someone to stand up for ordinary British people
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:48.760]  And as the past decade plus has taught us that sure as hell isn't gonna be the conservative party
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:54.920]  So yeah we're gonna pay France what seven million more than we did last year
[03:27:54.920 --> 03:28:00.600]  And apparently that's gonna stop these waves of boats because the French really want them in their own country don't they?
[03:28:01.400 --> 03:28:05.240]  Rejected asylum seeker attacks and injures two French border officers
[03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:13.160]  The Nigerian national who had been refused asylum in France was arrested on Wednesday for an attack on border force agents that left two police officers injured
[03:28:13.160 --> 03:28:16.280]  They want more of those people on French soil, don't they?
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:18.680]  No, they're just gonna keep sending them over to us
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:25.480]  Meanwhile UK to dump migrants in rural areas as bids to fix channel crisis fail
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:31.560]  So basically all the lefty virtue signaling Lib Dem refugees welcome activists in
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:37.800]  98% white countryside areas of England, which is you know where I live by the way
[03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:45.320]  They're now gonna get the diversity they voted for no longer will it be concentrated in the major towns and cities
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:53.000]  The multiculturalism and all the benefits of it is gonna spread out into the rural areas and they'll get what they voted for
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  We'll be back summit on news don't go away
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:29:00.760]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world
[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:07.720]  Believe that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors
[03:29:08.200 --> 03:29:12.280]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather
[03:29:12.600 --> 03:29:16.600]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people
[03:29:16.920 --> 03:29:20.600]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin d3
[03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:26.680]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin d3
[03:29:27.080 --> 03:29:30.680]  But if you're not getting enough sun you will not produce vitamin d3
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:35.320]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over
[03:29:35.720 --> 03:29:40.280]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin d3
[03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:48.120]  And we have the best with our vitamin d3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50% off at infowarstore.com

[03:30:07.960 --> 03:30:12.680]  The first amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away your ability to speak freely

[03:30:17.320 --> 03:30:20.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years
[03:30:20.760 --> 03:30:24.520]  And I knew they were planning all of this and I warned the public as a modern paul revere

[03:33:25.640 --> 03:33:35.400]  Broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom. It's paul joseph watson
[03:33:37.640 --> 03:33:46.200]  Of course on tuesday, we have the insane maniacal feverish escalation into potential world war three territory
[03:33:47.160 --> 03:33:50.520]  When a supposedly stray missile hit poland
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:59.960]  President zolenski came out within mere minutes blaming russia with no evidence whatsoever calling on nato to act
[03:34:00.440 --> 03:34:04.120]  Basically calling for a massive escalation a potential no fly zone
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:09.080]  Of course within hours it was revealed that the missile was actually ukrainian
[03:34:09.800 --> 03:34:12.920]  polish politician blames ukraine for missile provocation
[03:34:13.960 --> 03:34:19.000]  This is a former councilman in the area where the missile struck
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:26.840]  He said ukraine caused a provocation by falsely claiming its own missile was in fact fired by russia
[03:34:27.560 --> 03:34:33.560]  Of course, they came out afterwards prime minister rishi sunak nato heads and said doesn't matter. It's russia's fault anyway
[03:34:34.040 --> 03:34:39.240]  ukraine could literally launch nuclear missiles into warsaw and they blame russia
[03:34:40.120 --> 03:34:42.120]  but jaraslaw pakula
[03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:49.560]  This polish councilman with previously shown staunch support for ukraine. He had a ukraine flag in his facebook bio
[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:52.120]  He was all signed up for the cause
[03:34:53.080 --> 03:34:58.120]  Got really angry at this and said it was time for poland to change its entire outlook on the war
[03:34:58.600 --> 03:35:03.800]  He said the missile accident showed warsaw needed to send a blunt message to kiev or kiev
[03:35:04.360 --> 03:35:07.400]  Rather than telling its own citizens quote fairy tales
[03:35:07.400 --> 03:35:13.560]  Said of course, this is a ukrainian rocket. Of course, this is a provocation on the part of the ukrainian authorities
[03:35:14.440 --> 03:35:19.560]  And i'm going to get into zolenski's doubling down in the aftermath of this on the other side
[03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:21.560]  But first let's set the scene with this video
[03:35:22.120 --> 03:35:25.480]  This is called shia madness. Let's roll it
[03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:32.280]  You'd think that with a potential escalation into world war three on the line world leaders would be a bit more cautious
[03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:38.600]  Not zolenski mere moments after a missile landed in poland the ukrainian president said this
[03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:45.400]  Terror is not limited to our national borders russian missiles hit poland to fire missiles at nato territory
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:53.000]  This is a russian missile attack on collective security. This is a very significant escalation. We must act fact check
[03:35:53.400 --> 03:36:00.840]  Wrong turns out the missiles were fired by ukraine missile that struck poland was fired by ukrainian forces evidence suggests
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:05.960]  US officials say it appears the weapon was launched by ukrainian forces at an incoming russian rocket
[03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:12.760]  Oh, only the most naive idiot would believe zolenski didn't know the incident in poland wasn't a russian attack
[03:36:12.920 --> 03:36:17.160]  And in fact was an air defense missile fired by ukraine. Yeah, he went public
[03:36:17.560 --> 03:36:21.640]  Immediately to blame russia and to call on nato to take action
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:28.920]  There gonna be any consequences for that any backlash to knowingly trying to escalate a potential world war on a phony pretext
[03:36:28.920 --> 03:36:35.560]  We all supposed to just forget about it and move on even biden came out relatively quickly and said it didn't look like a russian attack
[03:36:35.640 --> 03:36:37.080]  It's unlikely
[03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:39.080]  In the minds of the trajectory
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:40.760]  That it was fired from russia
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:47.640]  But of course only after he asked congress to approve another 37 billion in emergency aid to ukraine or the timing was impeccable
[03:36:47.720 --> 03:36:52.920]  Of course, it was us officials who originally leaked the information about the missile hitting poland
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:56.520]  Despite the fact that nato had already tracked the missile on radar
[03:36:56.520 --> 03:37:02.040]  So they knew it didn't come from russia the components of the missile also clearly indicated it was ukrainian
[03:37:02.040 --> 03:37:06.760]  Yet it was the narrative for hours yesterday that the evil russians had done it
[03:37:06.840 --> 03:37:12.600]  Look at these british newspapers from this morning tyrants war on ukraine russian bombs hit poland
[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:18.600]  Putin's war escalates russian missiles hit poland no waiting even for a cursory investigation
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:22.040]  Just run with the most feverish propaganda possible
[03:37:22.040 --> 03:37:30.840]  Sheer madness. You don't have to be a kremlin stooge to realize that such baseless provocations or absolute insanity
[03:37:31.240 --> 03:37:32.440]  Given what's on the line
[03:37:32.440 --> 03:37:38.920]  But british prime minister rishi sunak says it doesn't matter that ukraine fired the missile russia's still to blame anyway
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:46.200]  Oh, well, who cares let's just shut up keep sending them billions more and keep waving our little flags with behavior like this
[03:37:46.280 --> 03:37:48.280]  I'm sure everything's gonna be just fine
[03:37:48.280 --> 03:37:56.040]  So again zolensky came out within minutes said this is a terrorist attack by russia
[03:37:56.440 --> 03:37:59.720]  This is a dangerous escalation nato needs to act
[03:38:00.360 --> 03:38:07.720]  And then even after biden nato rishi sunak trudo all of them came out and basically said no this wasn't russia
[03:38:07.720 --> 03:38:10.200]  This was ukraine the next day
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:13.240]  Zolensky still won't back down
[03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:19.080]  Well headline out of information liberation zolensky insists missile that struck poland was russian
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:26.120]  Despite nato poland and us all fingering ukraine. He came out and demanded an investigation
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:29.800]  And for ukraine to be at the forefront of that investigation
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:33.400]  Still claiming that it had nothing to do with ukraine
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:40.520]  Again the irony of him demanding a proper investigation when within minutes with no investigation whatsoever
[03:38:40.520 --> 03:38:43.880]  And based on the claims of anonymous u.s. Officials
[03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:49.880]  He said it was russian with no evidence now. He wants an investigation that was yesterday
[03:38:50.440 --> 03:38:53.560]  And it took until today two days later
[03:38:54.360 --> 03:38:57.720]  for zolensky to finally start to climb down
[03:38:59.320 --> 03:39:01.320]  And backtrack from this narrative
[03:39:01.640 --> 03:39:06.440]  Zolensky backtracks after urging nato action for polish border blast reports zero hedge
[03:39:06.440 --> 03:39:12.360]  He said as of thursday zolensky says he's not sure about what happened. No first. It was oh my god. This is russia
[03:39:13.080 --> 03:39:17.560]  Then it was well. It's probably russia. We need an investigation now. It's oh, I don't know what happened
[03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:23.240]  And then everyone moves on. No, you don't get away with that. You literally tried to escalate into world war three
[03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:27.560]  Into nato attacking russia. Oh, sorry. Whoops my bad
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:30.280]  absolute madness
[03:39:30.760 --> 03:39:35.160]  He said I don't know 100 percent. I think the world also doesn't 100 percent know what happened
[03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:37.800]  100 percent know what happened. Yeah, we know exactly what happened
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:43.320]  You knew that it was not russian. In fact, ukrainian military officials
[03:39:43.960 --> 03:39:48.120]  Told the u.s. This was reported by cnn earlier. They admitted it
[03:39:48.760 --> 03:39:54.760]  That they knew it wasn't you they knew it wasn't russian immediately. They knew it was their own air defense missile
[03:39:56.360 --> 03:40:02.760]  You also had nato in lifetime on radar tracking the missile and where it came from
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:05.640]  They all knew it wasn't russian immediately
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:08.600]  And yet it took him two days later
[03:40:09.400 --> 03:40:14.360]  Merely to get to the point where he says we can't say specifically that this was the air defense of ukraine
[03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:16.600]  He's still not admitting it
[03:40:18.280 --> 03:40:20.280]  Absolute insanity
[03:40:20.760 --> 03:40:22.760]  information liberation reports
[03:40:23.160 --> 03:40:29.640]  AP issues correction to lie that russian missiles struck poland admits ukraine most likely culprit. Oh, thanks
[03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:32.200]  again
[03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:38.600]  They they they find alex jones 50 grillion dollars for something. He said the ap
[03:40:39.400 --> 03:40:46.120]  Can come out and escalate into world war three potentially based on one anonymous us intelligence official
[03:40:46.440 --> 03:40:50.440]  They get to put out a retraction a couple of days later and say sorry. Whoops. We got that wrong
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:54.520]  Almost world war three total nuclear annihilation. Whoops. Sorry
[03:40:54.520 --> 03:41:02.040]  The associate press on wednesday issued a correction to their false report that blamed russia for striking poland
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:09.560]  Says based on information from a senior american intelligence officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
[03:41:10.280 --> 03:41:14.600]  Russian missiles are crossed into poland and killed two people. That's what they reported
[03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:17.640]  subsequent reporting
[03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:23.000]  Showed that the missiles were russian made and most likely fired by ukraine in defense against a russian attack
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  Oh, thanks two days later
[03:41:25.320 --> 03:41:27.640]  And as chris menahan points out in this article
[03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:35.080]  The ap broke their own rules on reporting to amplify this regime nuclear propaganda
[03:41:35.560 --> 03:41:38.200]  nuclear annihilation causing propaganda
[03:41:39.240 --> 03:41:46.280]  Says under ap's rules material from anonymous sources may only be used if the materials information not opinion or speculation
[03:41:46.920 --> 03:41:51.240]  Which is precisely what this was and it was proven wrong within hours
[03:41:51.240 --> 03:41:59.240]  But again, they just issue a retraction one sentence everyone moves on to the next escalation
[03:42:00.200 --> 03:42:07.640]  Oh russia's bombed a holocaust memorial in ukraine in Kiev total bs totally made up
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:13.080]  Jewish journalists visited it the next day. It wasn't touched completely unscathed
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:21.240]  Snake island russia's massacred ukrainian troops on snake island bs never happened. They surrendered
[03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:29.720]  What was the other one mobile gassing vans from a 2013 youtube video
[03:42:31.080 --> 03:42:37.560]  Embarrassing cringe video of justin and rishi forning on phone to zelensky. Have you seen this clip talk about cringe?
[03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:43.480]  They're on the phone to him. You can't even see zelensky. They're going. Oh, we're so sorry about what happened to you yesterday
[03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:53.960]  What their own missile got shot off in the wrong direction and killed two polish people. Yeah real tragedy for ukraine, isn't it summit dot news we'll be back
[03:42:55.160 --> 03:43:02.360]  Alex, why is this taking so long? Why is this taking so long in france? They can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day
[03:43:02.360 --> 03:43:08.360]  Why can't we do this here? The answer is fraud and corruption if we don't fix the system
[03:43:08.360 --> 03:43:14.360]  It doesn't matter whether republican nominees donald trump or governor de sanctimonious. They're going to deny us michigan
[03:43:14.360 --> 03:43:18.360]  They're going to deny us pennsylvania. They're going to deny us arizona
[03:43:18.360 --> 03:43:26.360]  And i can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where i believe there is an america first majority
[03:43:26.360 --> 03:43:32.360]  In every single one of them so we need to keep fighting for reform of the system
[03:43:32.360 --> 03:43:38.360]  Tucker carlson said this better last night than anything else communications are the reason why we didn't well
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:44.360]  That's why info wars.com is so damn important. That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air
[03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:52.360]  Alex people need to get behind info wars this alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important
[03:43:52.360 --> 03:43:58.360]  We need more of this communications not less the tip of the spear throughout this entire process
[03:43:58.360 --> 03:44:02.360]  The only thing that made any republican victories tonight possible
[03:44:02.360 --> 03:44:06.360]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible
[03:44:06.360 --> 03:44:12.360]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns
[03:44:12.360 --> 03:44:16.360]  And the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible
[03:44:16.360 --> 03:44:22.360]  And that made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support info wars
[03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:26.360]  Despite the massive law fair being waged against info wars
[03:44:26.360 --> 03:44:30.360]  Despite the media defamatory libelist campaign against info wars
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:36.360]  The ordinary people the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier wealthier
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:45.360]  And wiser is what keeps info wars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era in an age of totalitarian oppression
[03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:49.360]  So continue to do it go to places like info wars store dot com
[03:44:49.360 --> 03:44:56.360]  Go to the places like save info wars continue to keep info wars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive
[03:45:00.360 --> 03:45:04.360]  The globalist are in an absolute panic right now
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:14.360]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians
[03:45:14.360 --> 03:45:16.360]  Not just in America but worldwide
[03:45:16.360 --> 03:45:23.360]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is info wars because we know the globalist number
[03:45:23.360 --> 03:45:28.360]  We know their operation we know their modus operandi and we know how to take them down peacefully

[03:46:56.360 --> 03:47:07.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones
[03:47:07.360 --> 03:47:17.360]  You're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson
[03:47:17.360 --> 03:47:26.360]  We still have three videos and I want to get to them all in this final segment first though remember it is the mega blowout sale at infowarstore.com

[03:48:00.360 --> 03:48:09.360]  Now of course the cost of lockdown continues to hit the United Kingdom today we had a new tax levy imposed on the British public
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:18.360]  Headliner of Breitbart UKPM Sonac Chancellor Hunt have declared war on workers with tax hike budgets as Nigel Farage
[03:48:18.360 --> 03:48:26.360]  The billions and billions spent on furlough paying people to sit on their arses at home and do nothing during the entirety of lockdown
[03:48:26.360 --> 03:48:35.360]  Which many people now continue to abuse by the way we also had a report the other day 20% of children are still missing from school
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:43.360]  Even now one fifth of all school children aren't going to school because their parents are so panicked by the fear mongering
[03:48:43.360 --> 03:48:50.360]  They refuse to let them go to school that of course has massive negative impacts on their education on their future
[03:48:50.360 --> 03:48:57.360]  But the real cost of lockdown in terms of our pocket books is being felt with these massive tax hikes to pay for all this
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:49:10.360]  Another cost of lockdown is the continuing phenomenon of excess non-covid deaths which have been running at alarming highs in the United Kingdom for about nine months now
[03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:16.360]  Again these are excess deaths, unknown causes, what a mystery, not Covid
[03:49:16.360 --> 03:49:24.360]  Daily Skeptic reports UK HSA Chief Jenny Harris attempts to blame excess deaths on climate change
[03:49:24.360 --> 03:49:33.360]  Yeah we had a few hot days you see back in August and that's why everyone's dropping dead mysteriously, suddenly dying out of nowhere
[03:49:33.360 --> 03:49:36.360]  Nothing to do with the vaccine of course
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:46.360]  On the subject of climate change though let's go to this video now because the father of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson got up on GB News
[03:49:46.360 --> 03:49:56.360]  He was talking about the sacrifices that we all had to make in pursuit of the hysteria that his man made climate change and he let slip a very revealing truth
[03:49:56.360 --> 03:50:00.360]  This is called he said the quiet poor out loud, here it is
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:04.360]  I think Stanley Johnson just let slip something he should have kept to himself
[03:50:04.360 --> 03:50:10.360]  During an appearance on GB News the father of former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this
[03:50:10.360 --> 03:50:17.360]  So it actually means that countries need to divvy up this carbon budget between them and then they need to divvy up the sectors
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:25.360]  And then they need to have the measures which deal sector by sector with getting the, and if that means actually some of us are told well you can't go on a plane
[03:50:25.360 --> 03:50:28.360]  That's fine, that's part of the national plan
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:29.360]  Excuse me
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:35.360]  And if that means actually some of us are told well you can't go on a plane, that's fine, that's part of the national plan
[03:50:35.360 --> 03:50:38.360]  Whoops, old Stanley just said the quiet part out loud
[03:50:38.360 --> 03:50:41.360]  You can't go on a plane, that's part of the national plan
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:46.360]  So it's part of the national plan in preventing climate change and pursuing the net zero agenda
[03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:50.360]  To stop people from being able to fly on aeroplanes
[03:50:50.360 --> 03:50:53.360]  Stanley you weren't supposed to say that bit
[03:50:53.360 --> 03:50:54.360]  You can't go on a plane
[03:50:54.360 --> 03:50:59.360]  Talk about a mask off moment, yet another brazen admission about what all this is really about
[03:50:59.360 --> 03:51:04.360]  Crushing your standards of living and paving the way for de facto climate lockdowns
[03:51:04.360 --> 03:51:10.360]  This guy is a poster child for Extinction Rebellion but just stop oil, the XR rebrand
[03:51:10.360 --> 03:51:14.360]  A billionaire funded movement of privileged upper middle class narcissists
[03:51:14.360 --> 03:51:20.360]  Who have been causing chaos and mayhem for ordinary working class people by blocking roads for weeks
[03:51:20.360 --> 03:51:24.360]  Chasing social media clout by attacking precious works of art
[03:51:24.360 --> 03:51:28.360]  Before subjecting us to their posh public hissy fits
[03:51:28.360 --> 03:51:32.360]  Are you more concerned about the protection of a painting?
[03:51:32.360 --> 03:51:36.360]  The banks are already creating carbon footprint calculators
[03:51:36.360 --> 03:51:41.360]  Which many fear are eventually intended to be rolled into a climate social credit score system
[03:51:41.360 --> 03:51:46.360]  Which would block payments for things like flights if you've exceeded your carbon allowance
[03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:48.360]  But that month computer says no
[03:51:48.360 --> 03:51:52.360]  Of course such restrictions won't be applied to multi-millionaire Stanley Johnson
[03:51:52.360 --> 03:51:56.360]  And his cronies the type who use private jets like you'd use a taxi
[03:51:56.360 --> 03:52:00.360]  Because they can afford to buy carbon credits which allow them to bypass it all
[03:52:00.360 --> 03:52:04.360]  And then they're all heavily invested in the carbon trading mechanism anyway
[03:52:04.360 --> 03:52:06.360]  So it's a win-win for them
[03:52:06.360 --> 03:52:08.360]  Your annual family holiday though
[03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:13.360]  Well we just did a temperature measurement on the tarmac at Heathrow airport and it says hottest day ever
[03:52:13.360 --> 03:52:17.360]  So say goodbye to that Greek vacation you were looking forward to
[03:52:17.360 --> 03:52:18.360]  You can't go on a plane
[03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:25.360]  Now of course you'll notice that these climate change activists just stop oil and the light
[03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:29.360]  They always attack precious historic works of art that everybody really appreciates and loves
[03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:34.360]  They very rarely or never in fact attack works of modern art
[03:52:34.360 --> 03:52:36.360]  Which brings us to our next video
[03:52:36.360 --> 03:52:40.360]  You'll never believe what someone paid 41 million dollars for
[03:52:40.360 --> 03:52:43.360]  This is called 41 million for this
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:44.360]  Let's roll it
[03:52:44.360 --> 03:52:50.360]  Some idiot at an auction just paid over 41 million dollars for this
[03:52:50.360 --> 03:52:53.360]  Saitwambli is untitled
[03:52:53.360 --> 03:52:54.360]  No I'm not joking
[03:52:54.360 --> 03:52:58.360]  During an evening auction at Phillips in New York on Tuesday
[03:52:58.360 --> 03:53:03.360]  Saitwambli's 16 foot wide untitled painting from 2005
[03:53:03.360 --> 03:53:06.360]  The second largest from his backer series of swirling canvases
[03:53:06.360 --> 03:53:09.360]  Sold for 41.6 million dollars
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:11.360]  The fall and his money are easily parted
[03:53:11.360 --> 03:53:13.360]  Imagine being so out of touch
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:15.360]  So disgustingly rich
[03:53:15.360 --> 03:53:17.360]  That during a cost of living crisis
[03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:19.360]  Runaway inflation chaos
[03:53:19.360 --> 03:53:25.360]  With hundreds of millions of people in the west having to choose between heating and eating this winter
[03:53:25.360 --> 03:53:30.360]  You can afford to dump 41 mil on something that looks like an angry child
[03:53:30.360 --> 03:53:33.360]  With behavioural issues has been let loose with a paintbrush
[03:53:33.360 --> 03:53:35.360]  Listen to how these morons describe it
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:37.360]  Created in 2005
[03:53:37.360 --> 03:53:41.360]  Saitwambli's untitled is swayed with circular applications of red paint
[03:53:41.360 --> 03:53:44.360]  That parades the eye into a cycle of violent spirals
[03:53:44.360 --> 03:53:48.360]  The series created between 2003 and 2008
[03:53:48.360 --> 03:53:51.360]  Was inspired by the ancient Greco-Roman deity Bacchus
[03:53:51.360 --> 03:53:55.360]  The god of wine who in one way reflects the joys that alcohol could bring
[03:53:55.360 --> 03:53:58.360]  While simultaneously imbuing a sense of madness
[03:53:58.360 --> 03:54:00.360]  That can be a byproduct of alcohol addiction
[03:54:00.360 --> 03:54:04.360]  Funny that because the dude who shelled out the cash must have been drunk anymore
[03:54:04.360 --> 03:54:07.360]  Saitwambli's enchantment by classical antiquity
[03:54:07.360 --> 03:54:11.360]  Is what informed and energised his artistic practice from start to finish
[03:54:11.360 --> 03:54:13.360]  To understand Saitwambli is to understand how his immersion
[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:16.360]  In the fragments and fascinations of Greek and Roman culture
[03:54:16.360 --> 03:54:21.360]  Made his work a living conduit to the enduring forms, figures and stories of the ancient world
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:24.360]  If Saitwambli is about something, this is what it is
[03:54:24.360 --> 03:54:27.360]  I mean, yeah, if some long-winded Ponzi description
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:33.360]  Makes you feel better about wasting 41 million dollars on a worthless piece of crap
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:35.360]  That belongs in the skip, you do you
[03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:38.360]  That kind of language is called obscurantism
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:54:44.360]  Pretentious modern art people invented it to disguise the fact that modern art is hideously ugly, depressing
[03:54:44.360 --> 03:54:46.360]  And objectively talentless, case in point
[03:54:46.360 --> 03:54:52.360]  A Pete Mondrian painting has been hanging upside down for over 75 years
[03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:55.360]  And no one even realised, gee, I wonder why
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:54:58.360]  One thing that differentiates an actual masterpiece
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:02.360]  Say Michelangelo's The David or Botticelli's The Birth of Venus
[03:55:02.360 --> 03:55:04.360]  From this visual abortion
[03:55:04.360 --> 03:55:09.360]  Is that even a f***ing toddler could tell you which way up it was supposed to go
[03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:12.360]  But what else could you buy with 40 million dollars
[03:55:12.360 --> 03:55:14.360]  A Falcon 7x private jet
[03:55:14.360 --> 03:55:17.360]  Or you could buy this luxury yacht and get the helicopter with it
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:22.360]  You could buy 300 return journeys from London to Melbourne in Etihad Airways
[03:55:22.360 --> 03:55:24.360]  Better than business residence class
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:26.360]  Including a private bathroom and an exclusive cabin
[03:55:26.360 --> 03:55:30.360]  Technically, you could literally buy the moon, all of it
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:34.360]  Or you could buy every single ticket at a Coldplay gig
[03:55:34.360 --> 03:55:37.360]  Alright, the painting's suddenly starting to look like a bargain
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:42.360]  Now, we're not going to have time for the final video
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:46.360]  Because we've only got a couple of minutes, but I'm going to basically explain the story
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:52.360]  Of course, you had the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX over the past few days
[03:55:52.360 --> 03:55:56.360]  With this CEO character Sam Bankman Freed
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:55:58.360]  Very interesting name
[03:55:58.360 --> 03:56:03.360]  But what went unnoticed, and it's all this, somewhat unnoticed by the news media, definitely
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:05.360]  Was his admission
[03:56:05.360 --> 03:56:09.360]  Now, bear in mind that these customers within this cryptocurrency platform
[03:56:09.360 --> 03:56:13.360]  They've lost all their money, basically now CNN says they're going to be left with nothing
[03:56:13.360 --> 03:56:18.360]  This guy, Bankman Freed, was the largest donor
[03:56:18.360 --> 03:56:22.360]  Second largest to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election
[03:56:22.360 --> 03:56:27.360]  Is the second largest donor out of all Democratic candidates behind George Soros
[03:56:27.360 --> 03:56:32.360]  This guy was a major, major player, which is why they're trying to gloss over this
[03:56:32.360 --> 03:56:37.360]  Of course, he's now lost basically all his net worth because of this Ponzi scheme
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:40.360]  Collapsed 94% in a single day
[03:56:40.360 --> 03:56:44.360]  But of course, the true story behind this, the true irony, the true hypocrisy
[03:56:44.360 --> 03:56:49.360]  Is that Bankman Freed is the quintessential virtue signaler
[03:56:49.360 --> 03:56:54.360]  He's echoed all the right progressive narratives at every step along the way
[03:56:54.360 --> 03:57:00.360]  Very interesting though, he came out in an interview with Vox's Kelsey Piper
[03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:06.360]  And admitted that woke virtue signaling is basically one huge fake smokescreen
[03:57:06.360 --> 03:57:11.360]  That the elite, the billionaire class, uses a communication tool
[03:57:11.360 --> 03:57:15.360]  To show that they're a team player within the regime
[03:57:15.360 --> 03:57:20.360]  To show that they can basically perform these loyalty oaths to the establishment
[03:57:20.360 --> 03:57:26.360]  And then as a result, as a reward, get to enjoy establishment protection
[03:57:26.360 --> 03:57:32.360]  And he basically came out and said, it's a dumb game we woke Westerners play
[03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:35.360]  Where we say all the right shibboleths, so everyone likes us
[03:57:35.360 --> 03:57:38.360]  He admitted that wokeery is a complete fraud
[03:57:38.360 --> 03:57:40.360]  It's a virtue signal for the billionaire class
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:45.360]  War room is next, don't go away, submit, don't use
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:51.360]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen
[03:57:51.360 --> 03:57:54.360]  Day by day counting these mail-in ballots
[03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:59.360]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:03.360]  It's election month, Alex, it's not election day
[03:58:03.360 --> 03:58:05.360]  And that's the problem
[03:58:05.360 --> 03:58:08.360]  And everything changed after COVID-19
[03:58:08.360 --> 03:58:11.360]  They illegally changed state elections
[03:58:11.360 --> 03:58:14.360]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone
[03:58:14.360 --> 03:58:17.360]  And sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[03:58:17.360 --> 03:58:19.360]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election
[03:58:19.360 --> 03:58:23.360]  We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this
[03:58:23.360 --> 03:58:27.360]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020
[03:58:27.360 --> 03:58:29.360]  And I have no problem saying that
[03:58:29.360 --> 03:58:33.360]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us
[03:58:33.360 --> 03:58:36.360]  That question our election integrity
[03:58:36.360 --> 03:58:41.360]  And question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are
[03:58:41.360 --> 03:58:45.360]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists
[03:58:45.360 --> 03:58:50.360]  Think about a world without info wars
[03:58:50.360 --> 03:58:54.360]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests
[03:58:54.360 --> 03:58:57.360]  And callers and stories we've broken together
[03:58:57.360 --> 03:59:00.360]  This family that is info wars
[03:59:00.360 --> 03:59:04.360]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[03:59:04.360 --> 03:59:08.360]  And Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[03:59:08.360 --> 03:59:16.360]  As being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order
[03:59:16.360 --> 03:59:20.360]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[03:59:20.360 --> 03:59:26.360]  Is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show
[03:59:26.360 --> 03:59:28.360]  I don't take the credit
[03:59:28.360 --> 03:59:30.360]  I give you the credit
[03:59:30.360 --> 03:59:33.360]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours
[03:59:33.360 --> 03:59:34.360]  It isn't going to give up
[03:59:34.360 --> 03:59:36.360]  Without your support we can be shut down
