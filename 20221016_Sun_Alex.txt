[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  It's Sunday, October 16, 2022.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  The world is in the greatest crisis that has ever faced. Get ready.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.000]  But where are the clowns?
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  Send in the clowns.
[00:30.000 --> 00:36.000]  Don't bother them.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  Isn't it rich?
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  Isn't it queer?
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  Losing my timing this late in my career?
[01:04.000 --> 01:12.000]  Where are the clowns?
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  There ought to be clowns.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  Don't worry, they're here well.
[01:20.000 --> 01:40.000]  Maybe next year.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  This reminds me of Ezekiel Emanuel and others back when we were riding Obamacare, bragging,
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  oh, we rode it to triple prices and screwed the middle class.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  And make sure we kill everybody at 75. These are quotes.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  It's all one big sick, disgusting club of parasites and sycophants
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  that have been in control of our country for at least 50 years,
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  that are running us into the ground that have nothing but disgusting disdain for us.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  There's so much big news.
[02:23.000 --> 02:29.000]  GZ Ping has been voted in by the Communist Party, not by the people,
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  as dictator for life.
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  No need to even have any more votes anymore every four years or so.
[02:37.000 --> 02:45.000]  He is now supreme dictator for life and says he's putting China on a full war footing to take on
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  the West after being built up by the same criminals that have hijacked and run our country.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  We're going to be getting to some of those interesting clips of the dictator in chief coming up.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Got a lot of world economic forum news, a lot of economic and military news,
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  a ton of censorship and Kanye West and MIA news.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  And yes, if you're tuning in on TV, I did this a few years ago and grew it back out,
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  but I got a haircut yesterday and my wife looked at it and she said,
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  I think it's time for you to give up the ghost and just shave your head.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  So I went to the bathroom and shaved it off and walked out and free turned my daughter out.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  But the media says I'm Lex Luthor, the supervillain, so I might as well go with the look, huh?
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  Mr. Clean, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  Now, I didn't do the best job getting it all, but I'm going to try to shave it a little bit cleaner
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  tomorrow morning. I didn't have any new razors. Once I buzzed it and I had a dull razor,
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  I was trying to get it all chromed up, but don't worry. I'll get that done for everybody.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  But folks don't tune in to see Mugly Mug. They tune in to get the analysis, the information,
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  information you're not going to get really anywhere else.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  And boy, I'm kind of taking a deep breath here because this is going to be a big broadcast.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  They're all big, but this is just insane.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  And we're going to be going over every stinking bit of it today.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  And when I say stinking bit of it, we're going to be covering it all.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  Also, attempts by the left to poo-poo anybody that questions 2020 election fraud,
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  Kerry Lake destroyed, Dana Batch live on CNN when we were playing that.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  Because the Democrats are still saying it's basically illegal to question elections,
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  though they famously are the big ones that question elections.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  And we already see Stacy Abrams in Georgia preparing everyone saying if she loses,
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  the Republicans are stolen it from her. But you can't question an election, but she can.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  So that's all coming up today. And so much more.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  Yesterday, a really important two-hour commercial light transmission.
[04:44.000 --> 04:50.000]  And we knocked it out of the park on World War III and on how they're setting up covid camps
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  for political dissidents. The latest developments there.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  Every cellular function of the body, it has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  Essential means without these things you die. And so much of the food is debased.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  But this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  The only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Finally, back in stock at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  Vitamin Refusion, back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  It's Sunday.
[06:09.000 --> 06:15.000]  We're live. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:15.000 --> 06:23.000]  If you want to stop tyranny, well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting World Live.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:26.000 --> 06:34.000]  Well, as they continue to cancel Kanye West's pop star MIA and anybody else who questions any establishment narrative,
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  folks like Kanye are doubling down, so is MIA.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  The breaking of the dam is happening on the establishment's information control.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  We, the people, are winning Kanye West's latest in-depth interview where he really takes the establishment
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  of the woodshed as posted at infowarstore.com.
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  We're playing some excerpts tonight. Here's the first one.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  But I'm talking about put out my White Lives Matter tee.
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  The White Lives Matter tee, don't say nothing. Don't say Def Con and nothing on it, right?
[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  I'm like, put it out. And he's telling me, like, yo, I want you to visit the Holocaust Museum.
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  And I was like, yo, I want you to visit Planned Parenthood. That's our Holocaust Museum.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  I'm like, yo, I'll put my life on this at this point.
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  Because they've been fucking with me too long. They put the crazy narrative out there.
[07:21.000 --> 07:29.000]  My Jewish trainer, Harley Passionac, whose Lizzo's trainer put it out when I went to the hospital,
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  put it in the press. I got a bunch of friends that went to the hospital. It didn't go to the press.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  They did that just like they did in the documentary on the third episode to say, we love you like the rest y'all.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  We know who your genius like the rest y'all, but sometimes you got to turn the camera off on them.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  So they'll go and get a dude that's supposed to be my friend that's been taping me the whole time
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  and buy this nigga out for $30 million.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.000]  I thought you co-signed that.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  I ain't co-signed it, but you get used to that.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  Paparazzi taking a picture of you. You ain't getting no money off it.
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  You just get used to getting screwed by the Jewish media.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  And I'm saying, y'all don't poke the bear too long.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  When I wore the White Lives Matter tee, they, I have four SoFi stadium shows.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  They cancel my shows. I said it's up.
[08:17.000 --> 08:27.000]  So there's a big frustration in the black entertainment industry going back really 50, 60 years that it is a fact
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  that most of their managers are Jewish. Most of the Hollywood leadership is Jewish.
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  That's a fact. And leftist Jews at that kind of the ADL variety.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  They want to put all the Jews in that category. It's wrong.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  A lot of great Jews, a lot of great Chinese people, a lot of great Mexicans,
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  but there are a lot of bad Mexicans, a lot of bad Germans, a lot of bad Jews, a lot of bad of every group.
[08:46.000 --> 08:55.000]  But I watched the whole interview and he, I mean, he lays out how how how leftist organizations in Hollywood
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  are creating racial division in America to control us.
[08:58.000 --> 09:06.000]  And he's pointing out that, hey, 77% of black people never got born in America
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  because of Planned Parenthood that was set up to target you're a black people.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  Kanye knows what he's talking about.
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  I don't particularly go down the road of him saying it's a Jewish problem.
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  But it's definitely a problem of leftists using racial division and calling everybody else racist
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  when they're using racist terminology.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  I mean, if you turn into the ADL and their meetings and summits,
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  if you just flipped it around and had them wear red armbands with swastikas,
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  you'd think you're here in Hitler. I mean, it is all racial.
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  White people are bad. All white people, but the ADL are bad.
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  And the ADL is going to lead all the brown people in a war against the devil.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  White people and we've got to fire all the white people.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  We've got to kick all the white people out of any positions of power.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  I played a clip of a trilateral commission CFR member last week at the Cato Institute
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  saying we got to shut off U.S. industry because it's a symbol of white power.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  That's pure horse crap.
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  Getting rid of industry and pipelines and factories hurts the average person of every damn color.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  But they said industry and any independence in America is white.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  What?
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  The top nine richest per capita groups for average income is Asians.
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  And that's because the stereotype is true.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  Asians, on average, have higher test scores, work really hard than Hispanics, blacks or whites.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  I mean, it's just a fact. So you sit back and you see all this
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  and you turn on Netflix or Amazon or HBO or anything
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  and almost every narrative is white people are bad.
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  And we all see that.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  And Kanye West sees this and he says, really?
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  Who's telling us to be divided?
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  Who's telling us? It's Hollywood.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  It's the Democratic Party, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  And they hide behind claiming everybody's a racist but them
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  because I don't care whether you're William Jefferson Clinton
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  or whether you're Larry Summers.
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  I don't care if you've got an Irish last name or a German last name
[11:12.000 --> 11:18.000]  or a Chinese last name or a African last name.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  If you're pushing the New World Order and division and control
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  you're part of the problem.
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  And it's true that the ADL is the closest thing to a Nazi organization America has.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  It has power and it has control and it teaches racial division
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  and racial identity.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  Just all the other groups are good and white people are bad except the ADL.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  And that's how corrupt prisons operate,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  not just here but other parts of the world
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  where they'll stick Sunnis and Shiites in a Muslim country
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  in two different parts of the jail.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  Then the warden and the guards play those two groups off against each other for control.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  Even though they're all the same genetic, same people, look almost alike.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  And if you take America, they divide the prisons
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  where you don't really have any Asians in prison much in the Midwest.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  It's black, Hispanic and white.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  Now if you're on the East or West Coast, there are some Asians in there.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  It's whites, Asians, blacks, Hispanics.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  And they all kind of have their own leader that self enforces.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  And if you're white and you go to prison, a real prison,
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  you've got to get with the white supremacists.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  It doesn't mean you're a white supremacist,
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  but you just get beat up and killed if you don't.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Same thing, you're black, you go to prison,
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  and you don't get under the black gang.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  You may not hate white people, maybe you love white people.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  Maybe you're mama's white, whatever.
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  The point is, or you're daddy, you don't join the black gang,
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  you get hurt, you get killed.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  Hispanic gangs, same thing.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  Most of the Hispanic gangs aren't anti-black or white or anybody,
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  the people, the race, the people.
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  And if you don't join that gang, you get hurt or you get killed.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  So that's what the ADL and the Southern Primary Law Center Democratic Party are doing,
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  is they've got an open air prison going.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  They've got all this media to make all the gangs fight with each other.
[13:10.000 --> 13:13.000]  And while we're all busy fighting with each other and hating on each other,
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  and oh, it's all the cops fault.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  Let the Democrats take the cops over, they'll be good.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  No, they won't.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  The cops are a diverse group as well.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  So they're trying to blame the cops and say they're all bad.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  And since the whole Black Lives Matter thing started, I got statistics today,
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  there's a more than doubling the number of police officers killed each year.
[13:31.000 --> 13:36.000]  And there's more than double the crime rate in homicide areas on average,
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  and it's more than triple in black areas.
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  It's mainly black people dying because the police are scared to go into those areas
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  because if they make a mistake or something doesn't look right, they go to jail themselves.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  So this is the designed breakdown of society, and Kanye West is sharp, self-made,
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  and he's pissed.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  And he doesn't like what's happening.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And I think the way that the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center have been so racial
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  to the highest level that you can't say that Kanye West is anti-Semitic.
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  When you have organized groups saying we're good because we're leftist Jews
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  and everybody else is bad, who's white,
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  and then we're going to be like the warden of the prison of everybody fighting with each other,
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  what Kanye West is doing is a revolutionary act.
[14:28.000 --> 14:35.000]  That's why I decry white supremacy, black supremacy, Hispanic conspiracy, any of this stuff.
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  And I decry radical Muslim supremacy, and I decry any type of forced Christian supremacy,
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  where Christians want to make you follow their rules and dominate you.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  I'm an American, I believe in religious freedom, cultural freedom.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  So this is a big topic that needs to be discussed, and I'm going to open the phones up tonight to talk about it.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  I get accused, a lot of these groups are funded by the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL to come out,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  by the white supremacist groups because I try to have unity as secretly working for Israel
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  and all this other crap, and then they go out and attack all Jews claiming all Jews are bad people.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  No, there are Jews who use the Holocaust, and the wrong things Hitler did,
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  when America, who's in the Russians, beat Hitler, you know, we're not Hitler,
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  to then say all their political opposition are Nazis because that's an effective thing
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  because people don't want to be called Nazis.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  Well, at a certain point, you've got to blame the groups calling everybody Nazis for creating racial division
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  and say that that's wrong, and that's what Kanye West is saying and Kanye West is doing.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  I don't so much think it's a Jewish thing, as he's saying, as it's an elitist establishment ruling class
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  using divide and conquer, and that's just those members of Hollywood using that technique.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  But regardless, he's thrown down the gauntlet in a big way.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  We'll come back, cover a lot of the news, give the phone number out, and we'll have a big talk about it tonight.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  Stay with us.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  It's our best seller.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  Essential means, without these things, you die, and so much of the food is debased.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.

[20:09.000 --> 20:29.000]  You've been down too long in the midnight sea. Oh what's becoming of me?
[20:39.000 --> 20:54.000]  There's a lot of power in the racial and cultural division. But we've got to run away from it.
[20:54.000 --> 21:16.000]  Because the people who are using these systems of control, whether they're the KKK and their failures and the joke they are, or whether it's the true organized evil of the ADL using racial control.
[21:16.000 --> 21:26.000]  In the final equation, we will fall as a species if we don't learn to work together. But we can't follow those dividing us and then claiming there are leaders and that they know how to unify us.
[21:26.000 --> 21:40.000]  We have to, through culture and ideas and through the American ideal of the melting pot, truly agree on what a better free society is and celebrate our collective freedoms and justice that we stand for and that we unify behind.
[21:40.000 --> 21:48.000]  And that in every number and every statistic is happening from Brazil to Germany to the United States.
[21:48.000 --> 22:01.000]  The reason they hate Trump is he's got triple the number of black folks voting for him, double the number of Hispanics voting for him and the numbers are growing because Trump actually unifies around justice and prosperity and freedom.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  That's why they're scared. That's why they're scared of us.
[22:05.000 --> 22:12.000]  And that's why I don't fight the racial division of the left by engaging in the racial division against them.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  I take the high road and here's a great example.
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.000]  It doesn't matter what color you are or where you came from or what your religion is.
[22:24.000 --> 22:33.000]  You're being targeted by the globalists for depopulation with these deadly shots that have been proven to be a fraud and a lie.
[22:33.000 --> 22:44.000]  And if we unify around exposing the globalist, the main threat to humanity, we have a real shot at not just survival, but in a future together.
[22:44.000 --> 22:57.000]  But if we let big tech and big media in Hollywood, with Communist China funding and owning four of the six big production houses now,
[22:57.000 --> 23:11.000]  pumping out anti-white, anti-American racial division 24-7, if we don't realize it's a trick and a game and rise above it, they're going to win.
[23:11.000 --> 23:24.000]  And that beautiful people like Dr. Zalink, an amazing Orthodox Jew or ultra-Orthodox that we're calling, understood all this and he brought it up on air and said we shouldn't go along with it.
[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  So there are beautiful people from every group and every organization and every culture.
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.000]  We're all made by God and we need to understand this, but there's a real Holocaust of abortion against our children of every color.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  There's a real Holocaust with these poison shots and that's the reality.
[23:42.000 --> 23:50.000]  And it's Hollywood that's been conscripted by the deep state to discriminate against people that don't want to take an experimental shot
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  or don't want to give it to their children or who don't want therapeutics documented to work being kept from them.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  And that should be one of the main unifying issues we talk about or the right to not be surveilled or the right to not be censured.
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  We should talk about what we agree on and defend it together and then celebrate our collective victories.
[24:09.000 --> 24:22.000]  And that's why they want me on fair because I love you whether you're a Muslim or a Christian or a Jew or an agnostic or black or white or brown or old or young or Chinese or Mexican.
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  It doesn't matter if you love liberty and you love God and you love justice. I'm your brother.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  So look at this.
[24:30.000 --> 24:39.000]  U.S. extends COVID public health emergency despite Biden announcing pandemic over because they're getting ready to do it again.
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.000]  Just in two hours I stay on that emergency Saturday broadcasts archiving them for worse.com.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  And Bill Maher knows the public's awake.
[24:46.000 --> 24:51.000]  Bill Maher COVID overreaction caused huge learning losses and inflation not the pandemic itself.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  Yes, the virus didn't cause 65 extra million people to starve in the last two and a half years.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  The lockdown did.
[24:59.000 --> 25:08.000]  And so this is the smarter rats leaving the sinking ship.
[25:08.000 --> 25:15.000]  And when the rats know they're not going to get away with what they were part of what they did because you went along with it all.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  They're going to run for cover when the lights get turned on.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  So we're winning.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  Look at this one.
[25:21.000 --> 25:31.000]  Biden's HHS and CDC paid screenwriters and comedians to mock the unvaccinated to discriminate against those of us that wanted bodily autonomy.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  That isn't a black thing.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  That isn't a white thing.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  It's not a Hispanic thing.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  It's not an Asian thing.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  It's a human thing.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  And I already told you this was going on.
[25:42.000 --> 25:49.000]  Billions of dollars to pay people to go out and lie and push the shots.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  And paid people to go out and demonize and attack and call for violence.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  As you saw in the late night comedy shows everywhere.
[25:56.000 --> 26:03.000]  About physically attacking people that don't take shots and how we're assaulting people if we don't wear a mask when it was all a fraud and all a lie.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  These are the bullies.
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.000]  So I wish Kanye wouldn't make it a Jewish thing.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  Because it's not just some leftist Jews that are involved in this.
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.000]  And it allows that to be spun into more division by making it about a group of people.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  Instead of all the great Jews and there's so many countless ones out there that are fighting the tyranny as well.
[26:29.000 --> 26:41.000]  In fact, the paradox and Zalinko made this point was it's a over representation of Jews fighting the COVID tyranny and over representation of Jews and media pushing it.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  Well, that's just because these are prominent engaged people.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  And I'm not up here as an apologist for the Jews.
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.000]  My God, the ADL calls for my arrest and it's an absolutely criminal organization, but I don't count them as Jews.
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  I count them as a mafia organization.
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  I don't count La Cosa Nostra and blame Italians.
[26:58.000 --> 27:04.000]  If an Italian mobster shook me down or did something wrong to me, I wouldn't then hate my neighbor that had an Italian last name.
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  It's the same damn thing.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  I oppose the Communist Party of China.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  I don't oppose Chinese people.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  I oppose MS-13. I don't hate Central Americans.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  I oppose the Mexican mafia.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  I don't hate Mexicans.
[27:18.000 --> 27:19.000]  I oppose the KKK.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.000]  That doesn't mean I hate white people from Louisiana.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  And they try to dumb this down and distract us from what's really going on.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  And it's disgusting.
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  Look at this.
[27:32.000 --> 27:41.000]  Our MIA, top story the last three days, dropped from GQ Awards after a tweet defending Alex Jones.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  No one explained something.
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.000]  I'm not knocking Kanye for his frustration and what he's been through and what he's personally seen.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  And he has a right to say what he's saying.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  And I understand he feels pushed around, so he's fighting back hard.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  And I respect him and I back him 100% in his free speech.
[28:00.000 --> 28:12.000]  I'm just saying, when you get the New World Order to trick you to get on their racial or spiritual or historic in-fight,
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  we should promote our worldviews, promote our ideas that are superior, and then people will come to those and we'll win.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  But when you come out and you say, it's the Jews,
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.000]  now you're entering the realm that the controllers want you to be in.
[28:30.000 --> 28:38.000]  Instead of just opposing the agenda and calling for unity, it's not effective.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  It's part of the global's plan.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  I'm not criticizing Kanye.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  I'm just giving Kanye my advice.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  I understand he's pissed.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  He has a right to be.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  And he is right that Hollywood's the tip of the spear creating racism in this country and it's disgusting.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  I salute him for wearing white lives matter as well, because that's the truth.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  We're going to give the number and we'll come back and cover so much news. Stay with us.
[29:24.000 --> 29:33.000]  There's a very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.

[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  And it funds the info war, which is the 360 win.

[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.

[30:51.000 --> 30:54.000]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[30:59.000 --> 31:06.000]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  and people don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[31:26.000 --> 31:33.000]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWareStore.com
[31:33.000 --> 31:36.000]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[31:36.000 --> 31:40.000]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.
[31:40.000 --> 31:47.000]  And despite the fact that it's selling out, X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.

[31:51.000 --> 31:55.000]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.

[32:01.000 --> 32:06.000]  Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  InfoWare's credibility.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  My credibility has never been higher.
[32:10.000 --> 32:19.000]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[32:19.000 --> 32:25.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[32:33.000 --> 32:39.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[32:39.000 --> 32:40.000]  It's unsustainable.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[32:44.000 --> 32:53.000]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[32:53.000 --> 32:54.000]  I'll never give up.
[32:54.000 --> 32:55.000]  I'll never give in.
[32:55.000 --> 32:56.000]  But I could give out.
[32:56.000 --> 32:57.000]  Thank you for your support.
[32:57.000 --> 32:58.000]  Wouldn't be without you.
[32:58.000 --> 33:10.000]  Saveinfowars.com.
[33:28.000 --> 33:41.000]  No more Mr. Nice Guy, folks.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  Man, this is a song that goes well with this show.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  With me.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  And I'm feeling real shot down.
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.000]  And I'm feeling me.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  I'm not feeling shot down.
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  I'm not feeling me.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  All the demonization, all the lies.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  Countless people call me friends, family.
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  How are you taking it?
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  Million-dollar judgment, demonized on every news channel.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  Well, this is an evil corrupt system that's hurting people and doing a lot of bad things.
[34:13.000 --> 34:21.000]  It just launched a bio-weapon attack on us and a poisoned shot starting World War III and getting rid of our borders and shipping in fentanyl and promoting pedophilia.
[34:21.000 --> 34:34.000]  So if these people aren't after me, the Democratic Party, the deep state, the same ones that finance billions of dollars of ridicule and attacks and calls for violence by mainstream media against the American people that don't take poison shots,
[34:34.000 --> 34:40.000]  if I wasn't being attacked by these people, there'd be something wrong with me.
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  So no, I'm not down.
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  I'm not depressed.
[34:43.000 --> 34:44.000]  I'm not defeated.
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  Because I have an incredible audience of activists of every race, color and creed that love justice and God.
[34:51.000 --> 34:55.000]  And I have brothers and sisters watching right now that I know have my back and I've got this amazing crew.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  And I knew the last 30 years, 28 years on air, what my mission was, and I've been led by God.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, but I'm led by God.
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.000]  And I'm doing exactly what I was made by God and born to do.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  And so are you, and we are on the verge of massive human awakening.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  It's already here, and that's why the corrupt system is panicking.
[35:18.000 --> 35:38.000]  But specifically cancer culture and the fact that all these big prominent top hip hop people, black and white, are coming out against the censorship against the New World Order and against the Holocaust of abortion and against the World Economic Forum and endorsing info wars,
[35:38.000 --> 35:43.000]  whether it's MIA or Kanye West, both defended me the last week.
[35:43.000 --> 35:44.000]  They're all in.
[35:44.000 --> 35:51.000]  They know defending Alex Jones is the symbol that they understand we're coming together.
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.000]  That's why Lewis Farrakhan, who is incredibly smart, has an unbelievable amount of energy.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  And who said things I disagree with a lot of things I agree with.
[36:03.000 --> 36:14.000]  That's why we were banned double banned three years ago, the second ban by Facebook and Facebook said Lewis Farrakhan Alex Jones are a special category.
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.000]  They're the only people you're allowed to call for violence against or attack, but no one's allowed to support them or say they're good or you'll be banned.
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  That was actually said all over the news.
[36:26.000 --> 36:35.000]  Because I've gone and met with Lewis Farrakhan, spent 10, 12, 14 hours with him, talked to him about how to end the racism, bring us all together, admit bad things have been done to black people,
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  but also admit that white people are being attacked now and manipulated and that the globalists are playing us off against each other.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  And that's what Kanye West is saying, wearing a white lives matter shirt.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  All lives matter.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Of course, white lives matter and black lives matter.
[36:49.000 --> 36:57.000]  We can let the establishment sit there and use a few bad things black people do or some bad things, a few bad things white people do and then make us all hate each other.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  It's stupid.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  But we're all under attack by the same globalist forces.
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  And that's what Kanye is talking about.
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  And you know, Kanye is probably as smart as I am, probably smarter.
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  So I'm not going to sit there and second guess what he's doing.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  And he just said, look, you jump the shark.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  I'm pissed.
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  This is what's going on.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  And from his experience, I'm not denying what he's saying.
[37:24.000 --> 37:31.000]  I'm simply saying that there are people of every group and organization that want to be in the Big Ten of freedom.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  And that's why you wore a white lives matter shirt, Kanye.
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.000]  And so I believe in your free speech to say what you want.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  I'm simply saying you're right.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  The establishment's using you.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  But the establishment isn't just your Jewish manager.
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.000]  The establishment's people like Piers Morgan and Chris Cuomo and Barack Obama.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  And the list goes on and on right at the top.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  And the whole Queen of England and that whole group way above it all.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  And here's why I raised that.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  If I went along with this, there'd have been 10 news trucks at our offices tomorrow.
[38:08.000 --> 38:15.000]  We've had ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and Chris Cuomo with his news show.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  And Piers Morgan and all of them wanting to come here tomorrow.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  And I told them on Friday, I told my crew, the producer talking to them, I said,
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  I will talk to all of them, but it's live or I'm not going on.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  And guess what?
[38:31.000 --> 38:41.000]  Both Chris Cuomo and both Piers Morgan have live shows with floundering ratings, by the way.
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  But they know if I go on there or Kanye West goes on there or Andrew Tate goes on there.
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.000]  Instead of Piers Morgan's show having a million viewers, it'll have 20 million viewers,
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  like it just did with Andrew Tate.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  And all he did for 30 minutes was attack Andrew and lie about him.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  He needs Andrew Tate.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  Andrew Tate doesn't need him.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Andrew Tate's the most good guy in the world.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  Andrew Tate's successful.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  He's a world champion kickboxer.
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  He's a badass guy.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  They've lied about him.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  But that doesn't matter.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  He attacked him for being friends with me.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  And Andrew Tate wouldn't throw me under the bus.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  And it made him even matter.
[39:18.000 --> 39:24.000]  So I told Piers Morgan, I said, listen, you little chicken shit.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  You come here and you do your show live, punk.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  And you'll have your 50 million viewers you want.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  The biggest show I've ever done on CNN was with me.
[39:33.000 --> 39:34.000]  20 million viewers.
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.000]  There's an average show with 3 million viewers back then.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  I said, you come here and try your crap with me live on air.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  You can have two minutes.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  I got two minutes.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  And I will mop the floor with you.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  Oh, we're not coming then.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  Because the last time he let me live on air with him,
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.000]  I beat the living intellectual snot out of him.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  And I told all these other punks.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  I told them, we're not doing taped interviews like Meg and Kelly did.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  Never again.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  You don't get your taped interviews,
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  so you can edit this stuff out of context and lie about me.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  And of course, they stuck their tails between their legs,
[40:15.000 --> 40:25.000]  and they peed on themselves because they're coward punks.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  Now, I'll do a taped interview with a lot of mainline organizations
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  that are known for credibility.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  I'll go on them, but I will not sit down with liars
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.000]  so they can jump cut edit what I've said and done.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  Here's Morgan hanging around with the pedophile queen.
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  Here's Morgan's a fraud and a coward.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  And I challenge his punk ass to come here and debate me live on air.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  He can have it be his cameras, his old deal,
[40:53.000 --> 40:57.000]  but we're going to have cameras there to document what is said and what is done.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Now, let me give the number out.
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  The awakening's here, and as long as we don't kill each other over what color we are
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  or where we're from during this crisis,
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  as long as we go after the globalists politically and legally and lawfully
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  and expose their new old agenda, they will go down not us.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  Their only hope is to hide that they're the ones behind our pain,
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  they're the ones behind the crises they admit they're organizing,
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  and to expose them, and instead of us all going down,
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  they'll go down and we'll all go up together like Robert F. Kennedy said,
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  a rising tide raises all ships.
[41:30.000 --> 41:40.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex specifically on censorship
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  of what Kanye said and the establishment scared
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  and the collapse of the corporate media and that whole debate.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  It's a big subject area, but that's what we're talking about tonight.
[41:54.000 --> 42:05.000]  877-789-2539, and I welcome Kanye West here and I welcome MIA here,
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  and we can do it live if they want or if they want to sign an agreement
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.000]  that I will give them a final cut and we can do an hour-long talk
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  and I can give it to them and they can do what they want with it because I trust them.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  Not that they agree with me on everything, but I trust them and they can put it out,
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  but they don't need that, I'll just put it out raw,
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.000]  because that's what we do here, is unfiltered raw information
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  and we've changed the world together.
[42:32.000 --> 42:35.000]  You did it by backing us, all of us together, I salute you,
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  and we're coming together, I don't care what damn color your skin is,
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  I want prosperity and justice and freedom and amazing things for you
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  because I know how the universe works.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  When you have an amazing success, I'm going to have an amazing success.
[42:47.000 --> 42:51.000]  These globalist parasites think somebody's got to fail for them to be a success.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  Their age of Satan is coming to an end.
[42:54.000 --> 43:18.000]  We'll come back with your phone call straight ahead, I'm the man in the arena.
[43:24.000 --> 43:27.000]  This is a very best atomic iodine out there.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  It supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[43:33.000 --> 43:40.000]  So X3, despite the fact it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  at infowarstore.com and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.

[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  This family that is info wars.
[45:14.000 --> 45:23.000]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders, like Nigel Farage,
[45:23.000 --> 45:30.000]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[45:30.000 --> 45:40.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.

[47:12.000 --> 47:31.000]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm a friend of thunder. Friend, is it any wonder a lightning strikes me?
[47:31.000 --> 47:44.000]  I fought with the devil. I fought with the devil. Got down on his level. But I never gave in. So he gave it for me.
[47:44.000 --> 48:00.000]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I can spot bad weather. And I'm good at finding shelter in a downed home.
[48:00.000 --> 48:10.000]  I've been sacrificed by brothers. Crucified by lovers. Been through it all my best to repay.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm no stranger to the rain.
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls. I want to cover all the news and information.
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  There's a few important things I want to hit right now that are so critical.
[48:24.000 --> 48:32.000]  I just sent the article to the producer to put on screen. We'll talk about it more next hour, but it illustrates everything I'm talking about.
[48:32.000 --> 48:39.000]  The New York Times came out and said, headline, the new face of white supremacy is Hispanics.
[48:39.000 --> 48:46.000]  See, as soon as Hispanics go, I want property. I want free speech. I want new process. I want right to self-defense.
[48:46.000 --> 48:53.000]  I want right to religion. I don't want to hate white people. Well, oh, you're a white supremacist now.
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.000]  Here, I'll show you the headlines right here on my phone. I sent it to you guys.
[48:58.000 --> 49:01.000]  I'll read it out on there. Overhead shot, please.
[49:01.000 --> 49:11.000]  New York Times lampooned for conspiracy theory that Hispanic Americans could be the new face of white supremacy.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  Let me get that article and that's coming up.
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.000]  But let me talk about the demonization of info wars to understand why the enemy's so upset.
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  It doesn't matter if it's Candace Owens. It doesn't matter if it's Kanye West.
[49:26.000 --> 49:35.000]  It doesn't matter if it's Paul Joseph Watson. It doesn't matter if it's Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or Chris Guy or Kelly to the people.
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.000]  They will tell you that either I'm the person that woke them up the most or first or had a major influence.
[49:41.000 --> 49:49.000]  It's not about credit. The enemy knows what we've done, what you've done supporting us has changed the world.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  And that's why they've now admitted all over national television. I already played it last week.
[49:53.000 --> 49:56.000]  I'm not going to air the new clips. I saw a bunch more this week and people sent me.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  But the Democrat Party law firm that sued Remington out of existence, all the rest of it,
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  saying we don't want money from Alan Jones. We want to shut him down.
[50:06.000 --> 50:12.000]  With their rigged court and rigged judge telling a jury I'm guilty and a billion dollars, it's a joke.
[50:12.000 --> 50:17.000]  But as long as we have the money to fight in bankruptcy and to fight for these appeals, we'll always be on the air.
[50:17.000 --> 50:27.000]  They can't even silence us. And that's why they're so pissed because they know that they'll never get away with what they've done.
[50:27.000 --> 50:35.000]  They know that our credibility is the highest it's ever been, that everything we've talked about is now coming true.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  And so as our credibility explodes, they are in full panic mode.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  We're doing more good a week on air now than we did in the previous five years.
[50:43.000 --> 50:50.000]  It's exponential and I give you the support and I thank you and I really want to appreciate all of you.
[50:50.000 --> 51:02.000]  So, that's why the London Guardian and others want me arrested or fully silenced because they are afraid of populism.
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  Here is Jack Pasobic talking about the phenomenon and then we've got Chris Sky talking about it as well.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  Now we should never give up and I commend them and I say I will never give up.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  Then we'll start going to your phone calls here at us.
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  So, the regime has come for Alex Jones. They always start with Alex Jones when it comes to these things.
[51:20.000 --> 51:30.000]  And the question is, do they really care about what Alex Jones said or do they want to destroy Alex Jones?
[51:30.000 --> 51:42.000]  Now, I think the answer is obvious to anyone with the right thinking mind that they want to take him down because he's a dissident.
[51:42.000 --> 51:49.000]  And the Guardian, by the way, if you go to TheGuardian.com right now, you can see Simon Jenkins.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  What does all Simon have to say this morning?
[51:51.000 --> 52:01.000]  He says, only proper online regulations can stop poisonous conspiracies like Alex Jones or Simon Jenkins.
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.000]  But the question is, who gets to determine this?
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.000]  Who's allowed to define what reasonable freedom of speech is and what these limits are?
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  Well, Simon says that he does, obviously, the government does.
[52:15.000 --> 52:19.000]  Like you saw the founder of Rolling Stone just say on Joe Rogan.
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.000]  It's as simple as this. The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  Most countries don't have that. I think the United States is the only country that has this, right?
[52:27.000 --> 52:32.000]  This enshrined freedom of speech in our highest law.
[52:32.000 --> 52:41.000]  That's what they want to take away, particularly when it comes to online regulations because they know that's the new digital public square.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  That's where people are. That's where people find themselves.
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  So, what do they want to do?
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  They want to take away your ability to speak freely.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  Now, they can lie whenever they want.
[52:51.000 --> 52:58.000]  And I'm not even going to just talk about in generalities like Web of the Master's Destruction or any of these things.
[52:58.000 --> 53:08.000]  But what I will point out is that Rachel Maddow in 2019 lied about one American news and said that they took money from Russia just to blatant lie.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  She had no proof and she knew it was lies, malicious.
[53:12.000 --> 53:19.000]  The courts threw that out because they said Rachel Maddow's show is obviously opinion.
[53:19.000 --> 53:28.000]  And even when she is exaggerating, she cannot be held liable for her opinions and exaggerations.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  It's not hypocrisy, though. It's hierarchy.
[53:33.000 --> 53:40.000]  There's one freedom of speech standard for people like Rachel Maddow and another freedom of speech standard for Alex Jones.
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  That's why you need to see conservative leaders who are so terrified to stand up say,
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  we're not going to allow this crackdown on dissent.
[53:50.000 --> 54:01.000]  We're not going to allow this episode to enshrine online regulations or any speech regulations in our country when it comes to politics.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  We're not doing that and we don't stand for it.
[54:04.000 --> 54:12.000]  We've got loaded calls here, Mike in England, Mr. Anderson in Michigan, Xander in Wisconsin, Rob in Alabama, Hammer, Hardy in Florida,
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  Mike in New York, your calls are coming up.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  The whole next hour of your calls, we're going to go to the call in England first.
[54:17.000 --> 54:20.000]  But let me just point this out that I'll play the Chris Sky clip later.
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  People have really been pointing out that Oxy Cotton killed probably 100,000 people he has to main.
[54:24.000 --> 54:27.000]  The company's own documents show they knew it would and loved it.
[54:27.000 --> 54:33.000]  They paid $665 million for the hundreds of thousands plus dead.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  And here's another meme pointing it out.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  Dick Cheney caused over a million deaths, lied about it.
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  There's no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.000]  There's no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, against us.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  Penalty, million plus deaths, $0.
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  Alex Jones, Sandy Hook was fake.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  Alex Jones, death caused zero penalty, a billion.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  They're telling you right there.
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.000]  But trying to scare you, it's all pie in the sky, it's all smoke and mirrors.
[55:03.000 --> 55:06.000]  But great job, Jack Pesovic.
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  You know, Jack four years ago came to Austin, wanted me to hire him.
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  And I said, Jack, you know, I've already hired Owen Schroyer, who's as smart as you, and it's really hurting bad.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  I said, you're too independent, you're too good.
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  I think you're going to do better working other places than here.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  I said, I just think, and now he is a thoroughbred.
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  He is just absolutely kicking ass and more articulate than I am most of the time.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  So I just feel good to know that over 28 years, I plan to keep going a long time.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  But they think they're going to take me out and shut down the truth.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  It's just started.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  Good luck, New World Order.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  All right, let me talk about this.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  We'll go to break.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  And I promise to come right back to Mike and England and others that are holding.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  We're listed supported.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.000]  Plus we have great products you need.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  And we're running the biggest sell of the year.

[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  You're on the air.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Hi, Alex for taking my call.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I just want to give a word of encouragement and insight.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  You know, the leadership of the country, they take us into wars, whether it's a civil war,
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  national wars, global wars.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  I can't let Kanya off the plantation, if you remember what Lyndon Johnson, his whole thing was
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  to subjugate the black family who had a higher level of morality, you know, stronger families
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  back in the 50s and 60s, early 60s.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  You know, this is design, divide and conquer.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  But because it is led by the leaders, you know, they always take us to war.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  The people don't go to war.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  The leadership puts the people more.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  And the Bible says in 1 Timothy 2, it says, therefore, first of all, that supplications
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  and prayers and intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  all who are an authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all guiliness
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  and reverence.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And I just got the feeling that maybe the church is kind of, we're not praying enough,
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  especially corporately.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  And, you know, it says first and foremost that we pray for the leadership.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  And when have you been in a church or someplace and we're all going to pray?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  And the first thing they do is pray for our leadership.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  And I think just a word of encouragement.
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  I think it would be lovely if you could open every show with prayer.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  I hear you, man.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  You know, I do talk about God.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  I love God.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  And I do hope people pray for our leadership and pray for global awakening.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  I really, really do.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  And I appreciate your call.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  I am specifically opening the phones up about censorship in Kanye West.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  Most of the time we have free-for-alls.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  You call about anything you want.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  But I'm asking you to call in because I want your view on a specific topic.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  And that's what I'm trying to have a debate about here.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  That's the discussion I'm trying to have.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Thank you, Mike, for the call.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  All right.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  I'm going to wait to go back to calls until I come back from break.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Okay.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  And I'm going to move through these callers quickly.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Hell, maybe we shouldn't even give people names.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Maybe I should get the phone board in here.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  And I'll just go to them like I used to.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  Bam, you're on the air.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  Bam, you're on the air.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Bam, you're on the air.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Because that's the way to really roll through calls.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  And we're going to roll through them tonight.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  We're going to come back from break.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And we're going to go bam, bam, bam.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  In fact, I'll take every call on the board during the next segment.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  Okay?
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  That's what we're going to do tonight.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Okay?
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  That's what we're going to do tonight.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Unbelievable what this country and world's turned into.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  We're in so much danger right now.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  The planet is in such a crisis.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And I'm just really concerned because we've been brought up all watching TV.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  And the average person's unconscious.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  And just can't even get out of their unconscious cocoon.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And the call is right.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  We have to reach out to God.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  That's really the answer here.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  That's really what's got to be done.

[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls tonight about what Kanye West pointed out.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  And he said that his manager told him he should go to a Holocaust museum.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  I guess to say he's guilty and he's bad and even though he's an American and wasn't involved with Hitler.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  And I'm not against going to Holocaust Museum.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  It's important to know what Hitler did and oppose it.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  But he's like, hey, the real Holocaust happening now is playing parenthood of our babies, particularly black folks.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  And that's being called anti-semitic.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  I mean, I think what he said on that topic is true.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  We're taking your calls on this subject.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Some say he's just joining us. I'm going to play the short clip again. Here it is.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  But I'm talking about put out my white lives matter to you.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  The white lives matter to you. Don't say nothing.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Don't say Def Con and I know nothing, right?
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  I'm like, put it out.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  And he's telling me, like, yo, I want you to visit the Holocaust Museum.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  And I was like, yo, I want you to visit Planned Parenthood.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  That's our Holocaust Museum.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  I'm like, yo, I put my life on this at this point because they've been for me too long.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  They put they put the crazy narrative out there.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  My Jewish trainer, Harley Pashnak, who's Lizzo's trainer, put it out when I went to the hospital, put it in the press.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  I got a bunch of friends that went to the hospital. It didn't go to the press.
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  They did that just like they did in the documentary on the third episode to say, we love you like the rest y'all.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  We know who your genius like the rest y'all, but sometimes you got to turn the camera off on them.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  So they'll go and get a dude that's supposed to be my friend that's been taping me the whole time and buy this nigga out for $30 million.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  I thought you co-signed that.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  I ain't co-signed it, but you get used to that.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Paparazzi taking a picture of you. You ain't getting no money off it.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  You just get used to getting screwed by the Jewish media.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  And I'm saying, y'all don't poke the bear too long.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  When I wore the white lives matter T, they can I have four so five stadium shows.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  They cancel my shows. I said it's up.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  All right. So we're taking your calls on what Kanye West had to say.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  We're going to go to Aaron in San Francisco, Aaron and then Mike and others.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Aaron, thanks for calling this evening. Go ahead.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  He finally spoke the truth. I'm so happy for Kanye. What a brave man.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  Unlike you, he's richer than you. He's smarter than you.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And he's got bigger balls than you.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Alex Jones exposed.com.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  Finally, the truth is coming out.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Hey, I want a museum for all those people who sacrificed in World War II so the Jews could be free.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Right? What about them?
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Did they get up?
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  Well, sir, I hear a lot of hate in your voice.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  We opened the phones up. We didn't screen your call. You're on air.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  We're playing what Kanye had to say and you're mad at me.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  I mean, is that because I'm not a Nazi or because I don't understand.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Sir, let me ask you, do you have an SS uniform in your closet?
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  You came to talk. See, this is the problem. The ADL's horrible and my enemy and they come after me are terrible.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And so are these white supremacists. I mean, it's bad.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  So, see, you don't want to be with the white supremacists or the ADL. It's the same group, basically.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  Hateful. Won't listen. Doesn't want to come together. Just he comes on. He could talk. He could barely talk.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Kanye's better than me. Kanye West says I help wake him up.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I'm not going to tell you what's happening with me and Kanye behind the scenes. You don't know.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  You don't know he might be on the air in two weeks in studio, do you?
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  So it's about Kanye's better than me. What does that even mean?
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  It's not about me. It's about us and having a free, open society.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  That's the mental illness. That's why I don't go to this issue because it'll either be people saying any criticism of Hollywood is anti-Semitic or Hal Hitler.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I asked him, do you have an SS uniform in your closet? You know he does. He's just as bad as the ADL.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  If you're in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Hey, Alex. I just want to start with saying thanks for waking me up and I hope you're well.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Thank you, bro.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  And it's an honor to talk to you.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Honor to talk to you.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  I can only imagine how much they cut up all these interviews he's doing to make it seem one way, like you said earlier,
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  appearing so it's racist and making it all about that.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  I wonder what he really is like saying in these interviews full length on cut. So I think the only remedy for that is for him to come on the show
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  and be uncensored truly and speak his truth.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Well, he almost came on three years ago. He almost came on two years ago.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  He's talked about his managers and his entourage that literally try to lock him up when he wants to speak his mind.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  And so yes, we're very close to getting Kanye West on the show, brother.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Anything else in the debate and the discussions bigger than Kanye or Alex Jones or anybody.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  I'm just asking about more and more people throughout Hollywood, throughout the media, throughout music are coming out against the power structure.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  That's got to really concern the system.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  And also to the last thing, Candace Owens, I know you're out there, you're probably going to see this somehow or hear about it.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  You should come on and promote your new documentary.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  I've been on Candace's show this year and she invited me back.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Guys, that's a great idea. Let's get Candace Owens on ASAP.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  We can get those big guest on the show. That's a great idea.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  All right, let's talk to another caller.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Hammer Hardy in Florida. Quite the handle. Go ahead, Hammer.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  I'll just try to get right to it.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Although I'm glad Kanye is on the team, I think his wording could be a little better because trying to make it seem as though it's a Jewish conspiracy is really not fair because it's like, what does the average Jewish person have to do with all the stuff going on in the world?
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  I think, for example, the guy that called in the SS uniform and the closet guy, how would he feel if people were constantly telling him all the problems in the world is a white conspiracy?
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Well, exactly. And I'm saying Kanye's shirt, White Lives Matter, is a good way to bring people together.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  But I'm telling you, the unsavory-ness of the Nazis and the ADL, it's two peas in a pod.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  Yeah, yeah. And I mean, it's just, I wish people that and realize, you know, like, especially because I'm black, white and Native American.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And on my mother's side, the wife's side, you know, they come from German Quakers.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  And the German Quakers, people I don't know, since before the United States even broke away from England, they were a part of helping to free black slaves.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  But they're white, and so they get blamed for, you know, slavery in the United States.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And, you know, it's just not fair, and it's also not fair to blame.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Exactly. It's not fair to blame all Muslims for what radical Muslims do. It's not fair to blame white people that a white supremacist went in a mainly black grocery store and killed a bunch of people.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  It's not fair to blame black people because the guy that's like part black ran over folks at a parade.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  But it is good to condemn them and the hatred of why they did it.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  And then to realize the left is pushing 10 times the racial division, the right wing is they're disgusting and I'm sick of them.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  And so is Kanye. And he's right.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  There are a bunch of leftist organizations, including Jewish organizations that are pushing racism and they need to be called out.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Yeah, and I think you should get Judge Joe Brown on to talk about.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Exactly. I want Candace Owens. I want Judge Joe Brown. I want him all this week.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Candace said she'd come on last time I was on her show.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  I know she works really hard, but it's busy, but I want to get her on.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  Great ideas, Hammer.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  All right, up next, Rob in Alabama. Rob, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Hey, I agree with Kanye. Everything he's saying, you know, he's been on the inside circle and a lot of things on the way the media works.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  And he starts categorizing people as one type of thing.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  However, there's we're just under such a multifaceted fact that you can't just blame one group of people to, you know, point out there behind what's going on.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  And we're the ones there.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Well, I think from his experience with Hollywood, he's he's what he sees and I respect that he's saying, leave me alone. So I respect what he's saying.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  I'm just saying that I disagree with with with with going that far, but he's his own man.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  I support his free speech and he shouldn't be penalized or canceled for it.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Yeah, the big thing is they want to try to divide us that anyone who has any voice that way we don't all come together as a whole.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  Because that's that's the number one thing that they're fighting.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Exactly, Rob, we're all being attacked by the poison shots.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  We're all being hit by the chemtrails. We're all being hit by the GMO and he's a stop. God bless you.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  Alexander, Vincent, Aaron, Ray, Miss Shea, your calls are coming in. Bam, bam, bam on the other side.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  And if folks want to call in that a free speech, you're welcome as well.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Or if you're a black supremacist, white supremacist, you're welcome to call in.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  I disagree with you, but you're welcome to call in.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Now, I knew that and for 28 years I've been on air exposed to these people and together we've had a great effect.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  But listen, they're coming after us right now. They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we, the people of you and I together.

[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge yourselves, it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system,
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average, take a few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.

[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  Essential means without these things you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.

[1:19:54.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  Alright, we're talking about free speech in America and we're expelling with Kanye West, I have to say.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  He attempts to silence him. We're going to the Order Your Calls are received.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Xander in Wisconsin, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  Hey, Mr. Jones, can you hear me okay?
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Absolutely, you're on the air right now.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  Okay, regarding the Kanye stuff, in the good book in Revelations, it says specifically, synagogue of Satan.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  I don't think that exactly aligns with the Jewish people because I think Satanism has like grand diversity.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  We're saying using a variety of ways to capture people.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  That's right, Satan's got a camp in every group and organization.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Yes, and I think the elephant in the room that no one really wants to talk about is money addiction and how money addiction plays a role in this.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  There's genetic predispositions that we all know about because of environmental and history factors where Native Americans have trouble with alcohol
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  because they didn't have it in their history as long as Europeans or Serbians and cigarettes because of Turkish influence in the region.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  And I think the Jewish people have a predisposition to money addiction and as you know with everyone has money problems and deals with money as part of living in a society,
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  that it's very easy to have your morals and values become very flexible and then eventually lead to devilish way if you become too self-absorbed with money.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  And granted, there are true believers in the Satanic culture and not in it for money, maybe more for power or for other means,
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  but I think especially in a post-COVID-19 world and the money grab related to it, it's pretty apparent that there's a variety of interest groups in the mix here
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  and we should focus more on solutions.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  Right, and the globalists cut off resources so we don't have enough so they can dictate control. That's why they do it, sorry.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  We were saying we should also focus on solutions, you know, and like with solutions to hate, you can't use more hate or more killing to stop hate,
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  more hate to stop hate, so you have to use love, you know, and we need to find ways to be more, have more fun,
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  make our way of living more enjoyable, which obviously if you look through history, Christianity has yielded the most comfortable
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  and mimicked and copied lifestyle and society around the world just because of the morals and values and freedoms most importantly attached to it.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  And Kanye West talking about this is bringing it to the forefront and also what's happening with you is bringing it to the forefront
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  because I think it's related, you know, locally you look at the comparison between like the Walk of Shaw Christmas Parade case and your case,
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  it's like night and day difference, it's like if I'm living in the same world, you know, it's a total different dimension.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  Total coverage of me found guilty by a judge putting on all this false, they say I sent a listener to pee on a grave,
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  they don't have a witness, they don't have video, they don't even have who did it, they just say a man pee on our grave, Alex sent him, totally made up,
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  but we've got to like bow down and go, oh, billion dollars, somebody pee on your grave, all made up, in my view, I mean there's no evidence,
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  it's just insane, great points, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Texas Skeptics as he disagrees, go ahead Texas Skeptics, go ahead.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Hey Alex, I just want to talk about Kanye and what he's saying, you know, you said there's bad people in all the groups and I agree with you,
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  and I'm a Mexican myself, but the problem that I'm having trouble reconciling is that 2% of America's population control, 98% of the media, 98% of the banks,
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  and they all identify with a certain group, and it's the group Kanye's calling out.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  How do we reconcile that? I'm not a racist, I'm not a Nazi, I grew up with people coming to my school as a Texas student with a tattoo on their arm,
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  telling me what victims they've been, and I believe them, but then you can't question, to find out who rules you, don't you just find out who you can't question?
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Well, I mean, that's why we open the phones up for people to have free space here, and you're bringing up reasonable points here,
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  and the guy that called in earlier, you know, was like, you're covering this up, and I'm here opening the phones up, we're just discussing it,
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  and I think that's why we're having this discussion, it needs to be had.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Anything else, Texas skeptic?
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  George Soros, he affiliates himself with that group, and Hungary calls him a terrorist, that's an entire country.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  I always had a big problem when I would see videos of Hitler, and they wouldn't translate his German speech,
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  and they just said he was a tyrant terrorist, but they would never translate what he was saying,
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  and it was hard for me to reconcile how he could convince millions of people, millions of humans, to hate, because I don't have hate in my heart.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  I have love, I want to defend my country, but what is the common thread in all these places?
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  If you look at the top 20 trending on YouTube, it was always, over the last three years, it was always a cross-dressing mail.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  Well, the CEO of that affiliates with one particular group of people.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Why is that? Why is it this group that all the CEOs have such corruption where they want to put that spirit on our children
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  to look at the top trending on Twitter or YouTube, and it's always a cross-dressing mail?
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  What does that say?
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Well, there's no doubt that Hollywood's satanic, and out of control, and dropped to everybody,
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  and people are really rejecting that, and there's a big resistance to it,
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  and I just say I oppose the evil activity, and support people's free speech should be able to discuss whatever they think is most important.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  All right, a founding member of the original real Black Panther Party, not the black supremacist new one, is Larry Pinckney,
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  and he was just on this a few weeks ago, and I want to invite him back on to talk about this this week for a full hour,
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  and I'm going to hold him over too after this break, but Larry Pinckney got in on the line on this Sunday broadcast,
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  we're so glad he did, author, researcher, just an amazing guy, Larry Pinckney, your take on this.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Well, thank you first of all, my good brother, love you, love the crew, love Daria, love Infowars, love you all.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  All right, you're fighting the good fight, you're fighting the necessary fight.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Let me say this, the bottom line is divide and conquer.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  We, when I say we, I mean collectively across the board, whether people like or dislike how somebody says something,
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  they need to get some common sense.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Listen, understand what the substance is of what is being said, you know, to attack Kanye West,
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  and oh well, Kanye is, you know, this is absurd, it's ludicrous, it's ridiculous.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  The bottom line, you know, it's like when Joe Biden, you know, Mr, you ain't black if you don't vote for me.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  All right, I mean, come on now, let's be real.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  The bottom line is that Kanye is speaking from his heart.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  He might not say the words that he would, you know, that we would say or I would say,
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  but stop, we need to stop being pimped by the political parasite who pimping the pain of the people.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Hold on, Larry, stay there.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  I'm going to give you the floor for like five minutes when we come back at other callers.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  But I totally agree with what he's saying is, and let's just be honest,
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  it's a bunch of old rich, weird white people mainly using race to control everybody and Kanye's calling BS.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  That's right. That's right.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Absolutely.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  All right, stay there, Larry Pinkney.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  And Larry, give us your website real quick for people to check it out before we go to break.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Okay, it's blackactivistwg.org, blackactivistwg.org.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  All right, Larry, don't hang up.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  We're coming back to you in a few minutes and we'll go to everybody else too.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  Got loaded phone lines.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Owen Schroder is coming up at six o'clock.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I'm sure this discussion will continue with Sunday Live and that's coming up six to 8 p.m. Central.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Please stay with us.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  You need to experience it.
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  Don't wait.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  You'll be impressed.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  I'm going to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  It's unsustainable.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  So please, visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  SaveInfoWars.com where you can make straight donations, 5, 10, 50, 100 dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  I'll never give up.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  I'll never give in.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  But I could give out.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  Thank you for your support.
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  Wouldn't be without you.
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  Think about a world without info wars.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  This family that is info wars.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  I don't take the credit.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  I give you the credit.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  It isn't going to give up.
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  We are drugged out.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  We are following other people's opinions.
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  We are controlled by the media.
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  Today it all changes.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  It is a choice.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  Just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  So we keep on saying, I hate you.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  I hate you.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  You fuck you.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  You fuck you.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Now we all know Steve Jobs' phones.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  They say Trump's crazy.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  They say I'm crazy.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  But I'm here to show love.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  It's a bigger plan.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  And I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  All right.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  We got loaded phone lines.
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  Owen Shroyer is coming up in 30 minutes.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  He'll continue with your calls.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  We're talking to Larry Pinkney here.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  But Kanye Warrant of White Lives Matter search beautiful because we should say all lives
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  matter.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  They call that white supremacist.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  So he gets that he's battling the Democratic Party, the new world order that is as Nazi
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  as you're going to get.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  That's how they flip the script.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  And so I back his free speech.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  I question particularly going after one group or whatever.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  But I understand his point about Hollywood and the rest of it and people's anger about
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  managers and things.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  But I totally back his free speech.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  That's why we're having a debate.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  But Larry, before I went to break, you were making the point that it's about how the establishment,
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  the very people that are trying to create racial division, many of the groups involved
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  in that are the most homogeneous organizations, whether it's Jewish folks in Hollywood or
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  whether it's China that's super homogeneous, a very close genetic group who then pump racial
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  division in America and are funding that.
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  So we're learning about the divide and conquer.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  I think Kanye's really giving us a great service with that.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  What do you think?
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Absolutely.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  The bottom line is we need to stop going for the ghost.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  H.R. Brown used to say, stop going for the ghost.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  We get pimped and used and we go for what the mainstream media says.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  The mainstream media is neoliberal fascist propaganda.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  We know that.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  Stop it.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  Just stop it.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  The bottom line is that black, white, brown, red, yellow people, all right?
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  Citizens of this republic need to pull together.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Stop going for the ghost.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  And we can all criticize one another.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  None of us is perfect.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  But we know the bottom line.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  We know what Kanye and others are trying to say.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  And yes, our lives matter, which means what?
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  It means that white lives also matter, all right?
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  If anybody disagrees with that, then they are racist.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  Then they are fascists.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  All lives matter, all right?
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  And you know, I'm not trying to be on Hollywood.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  I despise Hollywood.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  I have bought for many, many years and paid serious prices for it.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  And we'll continue to do so, God willing.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  So all of us, black, white, brown, red, yellow, all right?
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  We are together in this.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And don't let the so-called mainstream, because they're not mainstream.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  They're mainstream.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  They're nothing more than, you know, politicals for the Democrat Party.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  All right?
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  And I'm not leaving out the Rhino Republicans.
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  We need to hold them accountable too, but all in due time.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  So let's keep our perspective.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  Let's keep our perspective.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  Look at this overall.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  The media treats us like we're little children.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  Big tech treats us like we're little children.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Like we're in a romper room, kindergarten.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Well, we're not.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  And we're on the verge of a Holocaust.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  Not a nuclear war, something worse.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  A nuclear global Holocaust.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  So we need to say, no, stop this, pull back.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  Let's get some common sense.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And Larry, let me back you up here.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  I've got an article right here I was already going to cover.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  So it's an image.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  This is confirming the news.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  Colorado State University treats people like children.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  If they get upset by free speech, they have play-doh and toys
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  and little foot-told tables like their kids, and they sit there
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  and they treat them like their babies.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  It says, if you or someone you know are affected by a free speech event on campus,
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  here are some resources, and it's a bunch of leftist organizations to call
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  because they're affected by the evil of free speech.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  This is the total demonization of communication
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  because the satanic left is losing.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  It's the demonization, my good brother, of that.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  But it's also the demonization, if you will, my brother, of humanity.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  It's the demonization of humanity.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  And we must stop it.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  Stop it with all their decadent, you know, disgusting aspects.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Stop it.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  We've had enough.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Enough is enough.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  Go ahead, sir, finish up.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Well, no, I'm done.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  I'm done.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  I don't want to take up too much time.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  We love you.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  We'll talk to you soon.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  I'm glad you got in.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  I'm going to get to everybody now.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Wow.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Thank you, sir.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  All right.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Glad you got in.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Love you, Larry.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Let's go to Joel in Australia.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  Joel, you're on the here.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Welcome.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  Yes, I can, sir.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Go ahead.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  So I just wanted to ask you, why do you think they are creating racial division in the USA?
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  And how does this benefit the globalists?
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  What's the point of the racial division?
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  Well, then we don't care about all being spot on, all being censored, all being poisoned,
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  all being injected, all being locked down.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  And so we think the problem is our neighbors black or our neighbors white.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  It's just as big a diversionary action than the media can act as the arbiter or the referee
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  in the crisis.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And you know exactly when they started this idea with the racial division, the globalist
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  because I've read John P. Holdren's, et cetera, document.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  Well, let me give a overview, sir.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  What do you think?
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Well, I think they're doing everything they can to actually create division in all the
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  unnecessary areas.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  You and I both know there's no such thing as a race.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  I'm African, descended.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  I don't give a damn.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  I am just a human.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And also they're going to create division and also gender, which is unnecessary to create
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  division and gender.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  They're going to not just create transgenderism, but make men and women fight against one another.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  That's it.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  It's all on record psychological warfare.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  I agree.
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  So what's your view on Kanye's comments?
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  I think what Kanye has done is actually really good.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  Kanye West is always a controversial musical figure.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  And I think what he's actually done is actually really good and really controversial and really
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  impactful.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  He didn't write all lives matter.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  He wrote white lives matter.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  White lives matter.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  It's more impactful and more interesting and more grabbing.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  And I think Kanye West did a great job with that.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  He's very interesting.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  Well, yeah, he said that because you're not supposed to say it.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  When all the lives matter, you got to say the group is being targeted.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  And again, the globalists are doing it to make us kill each other.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Not because they care about black people or white people.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  They want power and control.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Yes, absolutely.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  And absolutely.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  We all do everything they can to actually make our lives a living hell in any way possible.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  And what Kanye West did was actually quite exceptional.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  I did enjoy it.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  I saw it immediately.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  And I saw his interview as well.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  He seems to be very sincere.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  He's not doing it for dishonesty.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Unfortunately for us, we've more evidence to just Elon Musk.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  It's not really as honest as we once thought.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  But I think Kanye West is a very honest man with this one.
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  All right.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  God bless you.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  I agree with you.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  Thank you, Joe.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  Thank you for calling for Pennsylvania.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  Liam, thank you for calling.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Go ahead.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Hey, Leah.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Alex Jones, you're a great inspiration to me.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  I pray for you.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  We pray for you every day.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  And for our country, I like that you fight for our freedom.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  My name's Liam.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  I'm your soldier.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  I just want to say that all lives matter in your life matter.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  Alex Jones.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  Well, Liam, that's awesome.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  And I think you got some great parents.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  What do you think about the world today?
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  I think it's getting more cruel by a second and it's changed a lot.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  I agree.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  What else would you like to impart to people?
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  I just want to say that Kanye West wants to prove a point that all lives matter.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  All right.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  Well, I got to say, you know, you're not reading out the script because I asked you a really
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  serious question.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  And you have a perfect answer, a totally true answer that most 50-year-old adults couldn't
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  give.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  Like, you know, what's wrong with the world today and where the world's getting so cruel.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  And then that's really, that is the problem.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  We need to be less cruel and more loving.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  You're right.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  God bless you, Alex Jones.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  Well, you got a smart, you got a smart 10-year-old son there, brother.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  We do.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  We do.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  I'm balling it right now.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  And you guys touch this all the time, all of you.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Well, you touch us.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  You're the only reason I can stand against these enemies.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  Now, give me my word, I won't back down.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  I will not give up, brother.

[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  but we're on hundreds of radio stations and they're trying to cancel us.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  It didn't work because we were still on those stations, we were leaving even more now, over 400.

[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  And let's talk to Aaron in California.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  Go ahead.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  You're going to tell us, you're going to explain Kanye's feelings to us.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  Go ahead.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  Thanks, man.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  I love you, Larry Pink.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  You've been awesome.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  A X2 brain force that changed my life.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  Thank you.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  Hey, yeah.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Thank you, man.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Important call because what I want to do is explain why Kanye thinks black people are the people of the Bible.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  And I want to say, you know, straight from the front.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  I don't like really how he's approaching it.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  Like I approach it from a place of love.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  Anyone who thinks they're Jew, you know, then live your life in accordance to God's law.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  If you're asking how to do, if you're a black Hebrew, let's be brothers and God.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  We share that with Christians as well as a black Hebrew.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  I still believe in worshiping Christ.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  But why do we think that?
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  Why does Kanye think that blacks are the people of the Bible?
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  You know, everyone's heard of black Jesus and his bronze skin, the burnt bronze.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  But also, you know, Psalms is written by a black woman.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  She says it in Psalms.
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  If you Google Egyptian pictures of Hebrew slaves and you see the actual pictures that are hieroglyphics, those slaves are black.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  You know, Alex, you're right.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  First chairman, the Bible about 10 times said Jesus had bronze, dark bronze skin.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  So, you know, the Renaissance moved kind of through Western Europe and stopped kind of in Eastern Europe.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  And if you look at some of the oldest pictures of like black Madonna, which is baby Jesus and Mary, they're all black.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  And so our faith just says, you know, hey, at the time of Christ and after Christ, we rebelled and we fell to Rome,
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  and moved out of Israel, fled to North Africa and suffered under Deuteronomy 28, the curse, through the North Atlantic slave trade.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  And, you know, so that's what he's trying to say, I think, and is not doing it really eloquently.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  But my thing is, the reason why they want him to stop that is because if we as blacks really know our true identity and we live our purpose and our potential,
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  then they can't corner us into this black culture of being rappers and basketball players and making money off of black culture.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  And so we would actually live up to our true potential and live our true...
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  No, I totally agree. I think Kanye is tired of Hollywood claiming they own black people.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  Just like Biden's saying, you vote for me or you're not black.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. So, you know, I truly think, you know, he does think we're the people of the Bible.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  There's some scripture to back that.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Aaron, I can talk to you for 10 hours. You're an amazing caller. You've got to get to the next person.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  That's the only downside is we've got to get to the next person.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vincent and Georgia. Go ahead.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Hey, Alex. Listen, Kanye is fed up with the Jewish powers of Hollywood.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  That's why he said Gefcom 3. He is doing or saying the same identical thing that Lewis Farrakhan and Michael Jackson was talking about.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  They talked about the powers, the elitist powers of the Jewish people.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  Not the Jewish people. Overall, no. Michael Jackson wrote...
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  But when Farrakhan calls the Jewish mafia?
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  But listen, Alex, Michael Jackson, let's talk about him for one moment.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  He wrote that song, They Don't Really Care About Us.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  In that song, part of those lyrics was, Sue Me, Julie, You Don't Like Me, Cock Me.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  He used a strange term and they told Michael, look, you cannot put out this album with those lyrics.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  Michael had to change it. And the reason why he put it out there like that,
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  he was fed up with the powers that be. You use the word, Alex.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  The Jewish people are very homogenized people. They are very homogenized, period.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  I don't know if you've noticed or not, but the Jewish people, overall, down through his centuries, were kicked out of many Jewish,
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  I mean, many European countries.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  The word's homogeneous. I said homogenized wrong word, but homogeneous.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Yes, they were kicked out, many European countries. Why? Because the Jewish people,
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  they always rose to the top of the heap of the economic system in whatever country that they went into.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  And that's one of the reasons, just one of the reasons why Adolf Hitler went against the Jews,
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  because they basically controlled the economy of Germany at that time.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  These people were at the very, very top of the heap.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  So it was easy, Alex, for, and I'm not saying that Hitler was, he was just completely wrong, period.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  But I'm just saying that he was going to bring them down because they were at the top and they were controlling everything.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  We'll do more discussion of this, and Owen's coming up, so I'm going to put you on hold, in case you've got more to say with Owen.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  We'll put Vincent on hold, because I'm going to cut him off, but I've got to go to the next person.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  I promise to. In fact, all these callers probably just hold over, because Owen will have two hours, plus almost no breaks.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  I mean, we're talking 50-something minutes an hour of no breaks, so we can do that.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Who's up next here? The order these calls came in.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Ray in Kentucky. Ray here on the air. Go ahead.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  All right. Let me take you off speaker. Alex.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  All right. So this time I wrote down a couple bullet points.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  What Kanye said, it kind of moved me because he's tapping into the truth on handling and slavery.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  I think that's important for people to pay attention to because of dominance and how it's a bad thing.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  But we must remember that Hollywood has satanically spellbound everybody.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  They're under something evil, and we got to wake up from it.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  We're doing that now. You're helping.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  Now, following the money is a good thing. We know who the players are now.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  I would like to put the point out there that the Jewish people are not nearly 2%.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  According to the Conversos, right? They bred everywhere, and that was a big thing.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  There's hybrids everywhere. Nothing against them, but the dominance and the control has to stop.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  So I'm jumping around a little, so follow me.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  Dr. Tony Martin at a Wellesley College, he's a professor there.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  He goes into the whole subject of the history of the slave ships and that they were ran and owned by Conversos.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  These people that were Jewish blood, but hybrids.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Also, the meaning of celebrity is glorified slave.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  Kanye touched on that when he said that he had handlers and people pushing him around.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  I'm not cutting you off. I'm going to put you on hold. I was going to come back to you.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  We're getting a little preview of each caller for the next show.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  Let's go ahead. Just have free speech here, folks.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Let's go ahead and take another caller here.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jack in California. Jack, go ahead.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  I just wanted to mention, starting from the beginning, whatever Kanye came out about his Republican views and how the media just immediately disowned him,
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  then eventually it led to his divorce, probably, I would say.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  The Kardashians had ties to the Clintons and probably the entire Democratic Party.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  The main point of this is why is the government giving billions of dollars to Israel every year?
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  Do you think that has some connection to the overwhelming Democratic majority in the media and just the reaction to Kanye speaking out about these views?
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  I'm just having a debate about free speech and over discussion.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  I think China is the main issue. We'll be covering that tomorrow on The Weekly Show.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  I'm just having a debate here because I don't want this stuff to be discussed and let everybody have free reign here to say what you believe.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  So, anything else, Jack?
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  I just wanted to thank you. I'm a huge fan. Have a good one.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Thank you. Here's what I'm going to do.

[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  I think it was important to do this. I'm glad we did.

[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  It's all there. Harrison Smith, 8 to 11 a.m.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  8 a.m. to 11 a.m.

[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  It is critical to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this.
