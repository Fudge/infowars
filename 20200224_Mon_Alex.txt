[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:30.000 --> 00:47.000]  ["Pomp and Circumstance"]
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, towns and cities are now quarantined across northern Italy and across South Korea
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  as the world discovers the shocking truth.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  The coronavirus is killing a lot of people, including healthy people, including young people,
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  and when old folks get it, there is an extremely high death rate.
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  Stock markets around the world are plunging right now.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  As the true nature of it begins to come out and as the cover-up becomes clear,
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  Dow drops 800 points as coronavirus cases outside of China surge.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  That's CNBC. You can see the CNBC numbers there on the markets.
[01:28.000 --> 01:38.000]  The S&P is down 102, the NASDAQ down 344, the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 924,
[01:38.000 --> 01:50.000]  the FTSE down 247, the Nikai 92 plus, the HSI down 487, Shanghai down 8.44.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  They're propping it up. The VIX down 6.49, and the DAX down 544.
[01:57.000 --> 02:06.000]  So you could say a long overdue correction, but the reason it's happening is obvious and incontrovertible.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  Government's covered up the true nature of the virus. It's now admitted that it's man-made.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  It's now admitted that the prestigious Indian Institute a month ago that came out and said,
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  we've scanned and it's totally man-made. You can see the insertion points.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  It's a commie road. It's a bunch of different families of viruses.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  No way this existed in nature. And it's got the stitches on it.
[02:28.000 --> 02:34.000]  Literal injection points, like Frankenstein does, where the arms and legs are sewn on.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  There are stitches across the cranium. Somebody else's brain has been put in.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  I mean, that's a silly analogy, but that's what it is.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  And now that it's been covered up, and now that that cover-up has been exposed,
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  this is going to get totally insane.
[02:50.000 --> 02:59.000]  Yes, Harvey Weinstein has been convicted. Yes, Owen Schreuer and his security team got assaulted by a mob of drooling zombies.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  I mean, you talk about escapees from a lunatic asylum.
[03:03.000 --> 03:12.000]  I've seen footage inside real lunatic asylums and these people act more insane and more violent than they do.
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  And you're like, oh, that's just a few of them. No. Almost all of them were incontinent.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  A lot of them had piss running down their legs. It was a nightmare yesterday in Austin.
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  But we're going to get to that later because this is all just too important.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  By the way, mainstream media has been wanting a global collapse.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  And it looks like this is the perfect plan for Xi Jinping to crack down on the riots he had,
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.000]  not just in Taiwan, but in the mainland, and as a way to export this towards the West
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  and give him a face-saving cover for the Chinese economy that lost the war with the United States.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  So now this is the blowback. We have forecast that.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  And that's what all the smart money is on right now.
[03:57.000 --> 04:09.000]  And of course, has been absolutely the cutting edge, the tip of the spear, and has been the most accurate forecasting operation, period, with the best guest,
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  the author of the U.S. Weapons Treaty and Law, top experts, top engineers, top scientists, top journalists.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  And we have just honed in on exactly where it came from.
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  Who did it now? Dr. Francis Boyle and others have laid it all out.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  So this is just an incredible time to be alive.
[04:30.000 --> 04:39.000]  And there's a whole other subject. You know, they're selling out of food in South Korea, in Italy and other areas.
[04:39.000 --> 04:46.000]  And now I just got word, so I was 30 seconds late getting on air from our big national food supplier.
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  I warned everybody it wasn't a gimmick. I told you it had gone up to 14 days.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  Now it's three weeks to delivery and everybody else is sold out.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  You name it. They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what they are.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  And there's several big articles up on infowars.com that break this down.
[05:47.000 --> 05:58.000]  UK teen fine at her house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman, order to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[06:18.000 --> 06:30.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.000 --> 06:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[06:42.000 --> 06:54.000]  The stock market is down almost 1,000 points on the Dow Jones industrial average right now on the coronavirus explosion news.
[06:54.000 --> 07:04.000]  So all the different mainstream media outlets that have been hoping that the coronavirus kills the global market to hurt populism and hurt President Trump.
[07:04.000 --> 07:13.000]  Well, it looks like you're going to get your wish. Remember Bill Maher last year twice said we need a stock market collapse.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  We need a quote crash was what he said a crash.
[07:17.000 --> 07:24.000]  Not just a plunge like we're seeing but a crash that means going down more than half.
[07:24.000 --> 07:31.000]  We see a crash to teach these people not to support Trump and to bring America to heal.
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  Talk about an elitist scumbag. Absolutely incredible.
[07:36.000 --> 07:42.000]  And now MSNBC hopes a global financial crisis will help Democrats win in 2020.
[07:42.000 --> 07:53.000]  Here's an article up on info wars.com Saturday and here's just one of the host licking her lips hoping for this.
[07:53.000 --> 08:05.000]  So if the stock market were to tumble this year, if we don't get near the 3% GDP growth that this administration has been talking about for years, these are all things that Dems can run on.
[08:05.000 --> 08:14.000]  They go on for another 10 minutes talking about it. Talk about cold blooded talk about tone deaf. If you're a Democrat watching that boy, I hope the economy crashes.
[08:14.000 --> 08:24.000]  We get rid of Trump. Do you actually think like that? Yes, because the average Democrat does not work or they're a tenured professor or government employee.
[08:24.000 --> 08:33.000]  So if they can hurt the free market economy and then turn people against the nation was Trump, they'll do it in a heartbeat.
[08:33.000 --> 08:43.000]  In fact, that's what Cloward and Pivens all about. Just one of the communist plans by a U.S. university that was adopted by the Democrats back in the 80s publicly.
[08:43.000 --> 08:55.000]  They said we want to overload the economy with migrants and with welfare and with people having all sorts of rights that don't exist like to have a comfort pony or that's a real thing or a comfort pelican.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  That's a real thing on the airplane with you.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  China doesn't even have any environmental standards or regulations. How do you compete with that? You can't.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  So they bring down free societies using our openness and our freedom against us.
[09:09.000 --> 09:22.000]  So this coronavirus is now confirmed to be much more lethal than they were previously saying and it is causing major, major jitters around the planet.
[09:22.000 --> 09:32.000]  Here's just some of the headlines. Coronavirus pandemic goes global. South Korea warns of watershed moment as Italy quarantines 12 towns, cancels, Venice, Carnival.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  And they're saying much higher death rate than previously reported. China has been covering up the death rate.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  Of course, they have coronavirus store shelves empty as panic buying hits Italy.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  People in several regions of Italy have reacted to the coronavirus spreading throughout the country by panic buying, leading some store shelves empty.
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.000]  The reporting massive deaths government officials are.
[09:56.000 --> 10:16.000]  I ran, then I ran came out and said no, that that was not true, but then they had to reverse themselves still yet again and admit that okay, there is a big problem.
[10:16.000 --> 10:26.000]  Coronavirus explodes across the planet. Italy rushes to contain Europe's first major virus outbreak, walking down most of North Italy.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  Coronavirus since global stock markets until spin amid rising pandemic concerns.
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  Kramer on market surge. Coronavirus impact on companies could be more severe than thought.
[10:39.000 --> 10:50.000]  U.S. Treasury yields tumble. Curve inversion deepens as coronavirus spreads Reuters lab monkeys infected with coronavirus in desperate bid to find vaccine.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  Don't worry Bill and Linda Gates already have one patented and ready.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  And don't worry the North Carolina University gave it to the chai comms.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  Five years ago the exact same kind of virus it's all on record complete smoking gun.
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.000]  Well, then why would you hand that out? Obama did that five years ago.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  You know that when it gets released, you don't know who to blame.
[11:13.000 --> 11:22.000]  Big controversies over that in even the scientist publication and other major journals, scientific journals back in 2015.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  Why the hell are you doing this? Why the hell are you giving out mouse pox that can be engineered to kill up to 98% of people that run into it?
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Why is that being done?
[11:32.000 --> 11:45.000]  Because they want to depopulate the planet. They want to have a major global reset to blame global stock market crashes on the pandemic and not on the fiat systems of the globalist banksters.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  We've been saying that for over a month and now that's beginning to come into view.
[11:49.000 --> 11:58.000]  I don't believe this is going to be the big one, but this is the beta test for a future mass depopulation event that I think will kill over a billion people.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  Bring in a world planetary government the name of stopping the next outbreak.
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  Then they'll have a decade after that another mass color that I believe will kill about 7 billion people.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  And so there'll be almost no one left.
[12:10.000 --> 12:16.000]  That is the official UN below moon negates plan is 500 million tops humans on planet Earth.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  Continuing lab monkeys infected with coronavirus to in desperate bid to find a vaccine.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  Sure, right. Moscow targets.
[12:28.000 --> 12:34.000]  Chinese with raids amid virus fears.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  We're going to get to that next segment.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  Could the 2020 Tokyo Olympics be a victim of C O V I D 19 no longer the who non virus.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  You notice they just moved on to the number.
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  Iran denies cover up after lawmaker contradicts official coronavirus figures says 50 dad.
[12:51.000 --> 13:00.000]  The city has been annihilated South Korea's coronavirus epicenter is a virtual ghost town.
[13:00.000 --> 13:10.000]  Distressed coronavirus Brits are in a bad way in prison hospital as worried son begs Trump to rescue them.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  The coronavirus outbreak just took some very bizarre new turns.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  I'm going to get to that after the break.
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  The CDC is covering up the real numbers fewer than 600 people officially tested for coronavirus in entire U.S.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Massive cover up underway.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  It's up on info wars dot com.
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  Hundreds of animals dropped dead in China after Beijing poisoned by virus disinfectant.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  How do we know it's not something else doing it?
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  We just know this is big folks.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  New York Post don't buy China's story.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  The coronavirus may have been leaked from a lab.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  Yeah, who reported that first?
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  We know it was made in the lab.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  We don't know that leaked or was let out on purpose.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  That's the only question.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  Coronavirus deaths outside China's spike is World Health Organization team visits Wuhan.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  Mike Adams with the latest will be joining us.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  Dr. Boyle teaches on Monday and Tuesdays.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  This is a big emergency.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  I appreciate him.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  I think he should probably just skip the class, but I get it.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Professor will be here with us Wednesday.
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  We've got a bunch of other expert guests coming on as well.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  But he's a leading expert has been absolutely on like a precision guided munition.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  So that's all going to be coming up.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  I had to open the phones up and take your calls on this situation as well.
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.000]  But the panic and the stock market is because they covered up how serious it was.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  And now that creates real uncertainty.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  We'll be watching it all today here live right through the war room.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  6pm tonight may have a special report to continue to track this as it all unfolds.
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  The Dow Jones industrial average is almost a thousand points down at 975 points point or two.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  We're going to break.
[14:49.000 --> 14:57.000]  I got word right before I went live that our main supplier at infowarstore.com, who is the biggest company, my patriot.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  They just dropped ship from info wars.
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  Their inner system against the fastest at info wars full spectrum of food, highest quality.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  It was first seven to 14 days.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  And now they've had to up it.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  We told you this was going to happen three weeks.
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.000]  Now they have the food, but they're running 24 hours a day after three factories.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  And they cannot guarantee it will be packaged and shipped out to you before three weeks.
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  We got your orders in before 10am this morning.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  You get it in seven to 14 days.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  Seven to 14 days.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Seven to 14 days.
[15:36.000 --> 15:46.000]  But now it's three weeks because of the fact that there's such a giant massive surge in food ordering.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  And all the others have sold out and governments and institutions are buying it up.
[15:49.000 --> 15:55.000]  Now is the time to get your storeable food as the highest quality at infowarstore.com with Ready Hour.
[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  I'm here with Scott Yousseam, founder of OMG Tax.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments sometimes in the same day.
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.000]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.000 --> 16:26.000]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[16:32.000 --> 16:43.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.
[16:43.000 --> 16:57.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112.
[16:57.000 --> 17:05.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:08.000 --> 17:17.000]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[17:22.000 --> 17:29.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:35.000 --> 17:40.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:40.000 --> 17:47.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:51.000 --> 18:06.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:21.000 --> 18:28.000]  This is a fact because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[18:36.000 --> 18:46.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[18:46.000 --> 18:54.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God.
[18:54.000 --> 18:59.000]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long.
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.000]  But man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over everybody.
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  About two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers,
[19:18.000 --> 19:25.000]  20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowars.com.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally,
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things. People say, why are you doing this? What's happening?
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet.
[19:41.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[19:49.000 --> 19:55.000]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[19:55.000 --> 20:12.000]  Silence.
[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[20:30.000 --> 20:36.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:36.000 --> 20:44.000]  Careful what you wish for, MSNBC, CNN and HBO.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  That's ridiculous to me.
[20:46.000 --> 20:54.000]  Can I ask about the economy because this economy is going pretty well. We have to, what? Why is that funny?
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  Well, it is going well for now.
[20:56.000 --> 21:03.000]  For now, right. That's my question. I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  And by the way, I'm hoping for it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy.
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  So please bring on the recession. Sorry if that hurts people.
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  Well, right now the stock market on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is being held by the Plunge Protection Team,
[21:18.000 --> 21:25.000]  the Office of Open Markets at 977 points, but they may decide to let it go down further.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  It's obviously being artificially held at that point.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  The CHICOMS have held their stock market as well. There's a lot of international coordination going on.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  So here's MSNBC just on Friday, wishing for the same thing.
[21:38.000 --> 21:46.000]  So if the stock market were to tumble this year, if we don't get near the 3% GDP growth that this administration has been talking about for years,
[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  all things that Dems can run on and they pose a problem.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  Pose a problem for old Trump. So we told you it was lab-made.
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.000]  We told you the response was a crackdown on Taiwan and the Chinese people revolting at Xi Jinping, dictator for life.
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.000]  And we said that it's more deadly than the mainstream media is telling you.
[22:10.000 --> 22:18.000]  Usually they hype up things that aren't as deadly like SARS as the end of the world, whereas the action by government says this is the end of the world,
[22:18.000 --> 22:26.000]  but then they're telling you everything is fine at the same time.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  And that's the suspicious combination.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  Now, I want to drill back into the coronavirus and some of the bizarre new twists that have been pointed out by Michael Schneider.
[22:38.000 --> 22:51.000]  And then I want to get into what's happening in Germany and what's happening in Italy and what's happening in England and what's happening in South Korea
[22:51.000 --> 22:58.000]  and some of the mass roundups and arrests that are taking place for something that they're telling us is not that deadly.
[22:58.000 --> 23:07.000]  But now the numbers are coming out. We know that it is indeed killing healthy young people and it is killing a high number of those that are infected.
[23:07.000 --> 23:17.000]  And that's why there's so much concern that coming out of places like Italy, they're saying it's killing a lot more people than the numbers the Chai comms have been giving us.
[23:17.000 --> 23:23.000]  Well, you can't believe a word that comes out of the Chai comms mouth, but I want to go back a month ago.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  I could have 10 storeable foods company sponsors. A lot of folks do.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  You listen to some of the other national hosts, they'll have three or four.
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.000]  I've been on there 25 years. People need high quality storeable food.
[23:37.000 --> 23:45.000]  I learned early on a lot of these big companies aren't the best or the small ones aren't the best or they're okay when there's not an emergency, but they're bad when there is an emergency.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  So I've got my finger on the pulse of things, my ear to the ground.
[23:49.000 --> 24:02.000]  And I know that all the other big companies sold out to government or big corporations a month ago and they're just taking your money and then scrambling and trying to find food so they can get it to you.
[24:02.000 --> 24:11.000]  We don't do that. That's why my Patriot started 12 years ago. I've had him as a sponsor 11 years because they tell me exactly what's going on.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  We've turned their factory, one of their factories repeatedly. I'm friends with that Red Hawk, the founder.
[24:16.000 --> 24:23.000]  He called right before we went on air and he said, listen, it's panicked buying at this point. Everybody else is sold out.
[24:23.000 --> 24:41.000]  We have enough food to go for another two or three weeks and then fulfill it out for a month. But we may have to make the announcement in the next couple of weeks at this rate maybe even sooner that we have to stop taking orders because they're not going to take orders when they don't have food.
[24:41.000 --> 24:59.000]  Well, I got a call during the break and took it and they said, okay, if it's locked in, it's guaranteed at three weeks. But we're going to have to tell folks now four weeks now and it may, we may at this rate just say, I mean, if it keeps happening in two or three days,
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  they may just have to say no more orders. I mean, they're not going to lie to you and take your order when they don't have food. They have the food. They have to package it.
[25:06.000 --> 25:18.000]  They've got three factories going 24 hours a day. They're exhausted because they are a quality outfit. That's why we have them. But to be quality is hard. Believe me, I know.
[25:18.000 --> 25:24.000]  A lot of times we're sold out of supplements because we just can't get the very cleanest, very best. Sometimes you can't get an ingredient anymore. You have to change the formula.
[25:24.000 --> 25:35.000]  So I understand what they're going through. So I'm not happy about this, that we're having record food sales right now because it shows how serious this is.
[25:35.000 --> 25:45.000]  So I said to them, I said, give me two hours for people that get in their orders to get it in three weeks because three weeks is a little long out there.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  They want to make sure that you're happy. It's kind of like doctors that under promise over deliver. I mean, that's really what's going on.
[25:50.000 --> 25:57.000]  They were saying seven to 14 days is seven days. It was being shipped out, but they wanted to have that cushion because things are so crazy.
[25:57.000 --> 26:05.000]  Well, now stuff's shipping out within about 14 days. So they say three weeks just to be, you know, super careful under promise over deliver.
[26:05.000 --> 26:12.000]  But he's like, actually, it is three weeks now and it's going to be four weeks. So just tell them four weeks.
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.000]  I said, can I have one hour to tell the listeners that they can get it in and get it within three weeks? I said, yeah, but that's it.
[26:19.000 --> 26:29.000]  And he said, well, maybe you should just tell him that in a couple of days we may have to stop taking orders. I mean, it's exponential right now in fullwarstore.com.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  It is my patriots. They're full calendar, full deal. You go right to the front of the line as your order comes in, boom, boom, boom.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  We're partnered with them. They are in our system interface. They're people and we have all the contracts with them.
[26:41.000 --> 26:49.000]  They actually were partners literally in business. And so you order from us. You're ordering from my Patriot. You're getting it in line as your order comes in.
[26:49.000 --> 27:01.000]  And you're getting the absolute truth here. But this is crazy. They're getting more orders of food in an hour than they were getting in a week before.
[27:01.000 --> 27:09.000]  You understand that? And we are getting triple the orders we were getting at the peak, which was last week.
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  And when I told you the food orders are only going up, that's not a gimmick that you to order food. The store shelves are selling out all over the place.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  Governments are digging in. They've got emergency centers set up that we told you a month ago exactly where they were. People didn't believe it.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  Boom. It turns out it's accurate because we have Homeland Security sources. Of course it was accurate. Everything I do is about being accurate.
[27:31.000 --> 27:41.000]  Infowarsstore.com. And I would get your storeable foods. I would get stock up on vitamins and minerals. DNA Force Plus is so good for your immune system.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  Regrows mitochondria. Makes the telomeres last longer. So good. X2, X3 is so good. Winter sun is so important.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  Vitamin D3, except that's sold out. The ultimate fish oil is amazing. It has high D3 in it.
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  And that stuff you already need that makes your life so much better for you and your children, for you and your neighbors, for you and your family.
[28:02.000 --> 28:11.000]  But it also funds the Info War. But with all that's going on, we still have the Super Blue and Super Silver with the Nano Silver toothpaste.
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.000]  Still at 50% off, even though it's going to sell out at current rates in less than a week and more isn't coming in for about a month.
[28:18.000 --> 28:27.000]  But we're just going to keep it at 50% off because it does help your body to have that Nano Silver in the mouth. Also the immune guard is almost sold out in the two smaller sizes.
[28:27.000 --> 28:37.000]  You can gargle that. You can even swallow it. It's super high quality. The Super Silver wound gel is patented the strongest gel that the FDA has approved for over-the-counter sale.
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  They use it in hospitals. Do not ingest it. It's poisonous. But it's for the surface. Creates a barrier. Infowarsstore.com.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  But I got to tell you, this has got me, I'm still going to CPAC. I'm going to be covering the virus a lot while I'm there.
[28:52.000 --> 29:21.000]  I'm not putting my children on any airplanes. I can tell you that right now. We'll be right back.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  I am blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:31.000 --> 29:58.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:58.000 --> 30:08.000]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements. Ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[30:08.000 --> 30:19.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other key co-factors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[30:19.000 --> 30:35.000]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue. It is back in stock. You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[30:35.000 --> 30:43.000]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.

[31:14.000 --> 31:29.000]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it. That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep. We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona SARS family.
[31:29.000 --> 31:43.000]  A virus. We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles. That will be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles. Great to have period, really good for your gums, really great for your teeth. We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[31:43.000 --> 31:58.000]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the US that's in only a security documents and everything because we get the best stuff. There's a lot of patriots. There's not just bad guys coming after us. There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals. It's very exciting.
[31:58.000 --> 32:16.000]  Across the western world, from high school to college sports to even the Olympics, men, biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events. This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away.
[32:16.000 --> 32:29.000]  All in the name of the liberalism and openness and that every day I have stacks of news articles just like today. UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[32:29.000 --> 32:41.000]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[32:41.000 --> 32:56.000]  That's the thought police. If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail. This is tyranny. These people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti human takeover.
[32:56.000 --> 33:12.000]  Resistance speak out against it.
[33:26.000 --> 33:36.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  This economy is going pretty well. We have to, what? Why is that funny?
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  It is going well for now.
[33:43.000 --> 33:57.000]  For now, right. That's my question. I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point and by the way, I'm hoping for it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy. So please bring on the recession.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  Sorry if that hurts people.
[33:59.000 --> 34:14.000]  So if the stock market were to tumble this year, if we don't get near the 3% GDP growth that this administration has been talking about for years, these are all things that Dems can run on and they pose a problem.
[34:14.000 --> 34:25.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Adams has been the most intrepid on target reporter in the last five, six weeks on the coronavirus. He's been dead on.
[34:25.000 --> 34:41.000]  He's been totally vindicated. And for that, he's been blackballed and even more punished, put deeper into the black hole that is the phantom zone that we've all been committed to.
[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  And I'm not a victim. I'm not complaining about that.
[34:45.000 --> 35:00.000]  The forebears were targeted and attacked for standing up. But America and the world should be really pissed right now that journalists and organizations that have scientists and researchers and the author of the U.S.
[35:00.000 --> 35:11.000]  Biological Weapons Treaty that became world law on saying here's the university it came from. Here's when it was sold. Here is the blueprints for it and it's confirmed and no one else is covering it.
[35:11.000 --> 35:19.000]  It's starting to come out that it's manmade. It's starting to come out that it's killing a lot more people. It's starting to come out that it's taking the stock market.
[35:19.000 --> 35:27.000]  Massively here's Reuters dow drops more than 900 points as coronavirus cases outside of China search.
[35:27.000 --> 35:33.000]  We know what this is. This is the answer to nationalism. This is the answer to Trump.
[35:33.000 --> 35:45.000]  This is the answer to a good economy in the West and China's fake overblown economy that had people rebelling inside China and without in Taiwan, a cover for Xi Jinping to then export.
[35:45.000 --> 35:53.000]  The U.N. three weeks ago was saying shoot people at checkpoints, weld their door shut. You're doing a great job.
[35:53.000 --> 36:03.000]  But when Trump said maybe we should stop flights from these cities in China, the U.N. said this is bigoted and horrible. And so we flew them here.
[36:03.000 --> 36:10.000]  Think about the death of logic right there. Think about the death of logic right there.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  So I have another update that we're going to Mike Adams. This just came to me from Matt Redhawk and my patriot that powers in four store.com.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  He runs it. He runs the terrible food area on it. That's just a portal to order from him.
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  Info wars life selects verbal food and the entire line of ready our their entire spectrum of food.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  With the rise of coronavirus trouble brewing constantly in other nations and more danger is constantly growing overseas.
[36:36.000 --> 36:44.000]  We have been officially notified by our vendor that food prices are on the rise. I forgot that part drew to dramatically increased levels of demand.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  Thanks to our focus on long term contracts provide our customers were able to hold on these prices for a little bit longer.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  It's already getting more difficult to order storeable food nationwide.
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  Our supplier is facing a 10 to 15 increase on every option of emergency food available.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  We can't hold out on raising these prices forever.
[37:02.000 --> 37:06.000]  Eventually even need to increase with the demand.
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  That's how it works right now.
[37:08.000 --> 37:15.000]  You should get your three weeks or your six months or four months while you still can.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  While other suppliers aren't even able to ship at all due to demand because they don't have the food.
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  It's also important to secure a clean filtered water supply.
[37:24.000 --> 37:34.000]  As the debris and dust settle in, having an election pure water filtration system can be one of the key parts of a proper survival plan at info wars store.com.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  Those that know what's coming are using today to prepare.
[37:37.000 --> 37:41.000]  Don't be forced to rely and wait for others for survival.
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.000]  Get one of our emergency storeable food options and water filtration systems today at info wars store.com.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  That's the lowest prices you're going to find anywhere.
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.000]  Now, they have the food, but they have three factories going 24 seven to ship it out.
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.000]  And they told me before I went live, they said, hey, it's now three weeks.
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  I get another call, not the segment last segment during the break.
[38:06.000 --> 38:11.000]  And they said, uh, tell folks actually they got the order and right now it's okay, but it's going to go into four weeks.
[38:11.000 --> 38:20.000]  And we may have to tell people in days a week that, okay, we were no more orders for now because they won't take orders that they don't have.
[38:20.000 --> 38:21.000]  They have the food.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  It may get to a point where, you know, they they because they're debating it saying, okay, we don't have food.
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.000]  But soon as we get it, we'll get it to you and you can, you know, six weeks out, but they're they have the food right now.
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.000]  But you need to get your orders in an info or store.com. It's great to have with all things happening in the world.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  Last 25 years, super high quality, tastes great, specialty diets, all of it.
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  But to me, this isn't just a plug.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  It's not just a way of life being prepared with firearms and the rest of it having friends and family take care of each other.
[38:49.000 --> 38:56.000]  It's knowing it's a war on the nation states and clearly tailored to bring down the world economy, which it looks like it may do now.
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  So you want to know how the globalists would strike back when nationalists and patriots are winning everywhere.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  You're now seeing it.
[39:01.000 --> 39:08.000]  Mike Adams of naturalnews.com stores shelves empty in Italy, northern Italy now under martial law areas of Europe.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  It's coming out much higher kill rates.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  This is causing a panic and stuff coming out of Iran.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  Please, we've got four minutes to break.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  Give us a synopsis and come back and break it all down into tail.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  All right, CDC says there are now 53 cases in the United States.
[39:23.000 --> 39:32.000]  We have reliable information that tells us that that's only one 20th of the total number of infections that are known to the CDC in the United States.
[39:32.000 --> 39:43.000]  Remember, as we reported yesterday on your show on the Sunday edition, the CDC is testing flow chart actually prohibits testing of Americans who have been infected by other Americans domestically.
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.000]  So there is no way by definition the CDC can detect community outbreaks.
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  And that's why they're saying they have no evidence of community outbreaks.
[39:51.000 --> 40:01.000]  So 25 of those 53 people were infected on that plane, that chartered plane that flew infected patients back to the United States along with non-infected patients.
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  And they separated those people with basically a plastic tarp and duct tape, which is insane.
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  And of course, that has made Trump furious justifiably.
[40:10.000 --> 40:21.000]  So the CDC is still releasing people after 14 days in quarantine in the United States, even though we now know that some patients can have a 27 day incubation period.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  We also have news out of China that patients are being released from hospitals.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  They're being labeled cured even when they're not fully recovered.
[40:29.000 --> 40:39.000]  They're still able to spread the disease, but they're being kicked out of the hospitals and sent back into the populations in Wuhan and other regions so that they can make more hospital beds available.
[40:39.000 --> 40:49.000]  And this reminds me of what's happened with the Travis Air Force Base in California, trying to export up to 50 infected patients to that Fairview Developmental Community Center.
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  I've posted full details on that today.
[40:52.000 --> 41:04.000]  That center has no biocontainment facilities, no training for handling biological weapons or BSL-4 pathogens, and it's just miles from Anaheim and Los Angeles.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  It would obviously result in a massive immediate outbreak, an uncontained spread in the Los Angeles area.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  You have to wonder, why is the U.S. Air Force trying to do that?
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  We have armed roadblocks in Italy now.
[41:18.000 --> 41:27.000]  So if you've ever wondered what a quarantine might look like if it comes to your city in the United States eventually, just look at Italy right now.
[41:27.000 --> 41:38.000]  I think 12 towns are quarantined and they have armed submachine gun toting military police who are on the roads and saying you can't come or go through this town.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  You get a three-month prison sentence if you get caught trying to go around one of those roadblocks.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  And overnight the shelves are stripped bare in Italy and Korea.
[41:49.000 --> 41:56.000]  We've seen it in Hong Kong, we've seen it in Singapore, to some extent in other nations as well, such as around Tokyo and Japan.
[41:56.000 --> 42:02.000]  But by the time the masses realize that they have to prepare, it's already too late, folks.
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  So if you don't prepare ahead of time, it's over. You can't get it.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  Because the day the masses wake up and realize this, it's over.
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.000]  I mean, right now, I know, Alex, that your store is running at about capacity.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  We are at total capacity. We are oversold. We can barely catch up.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  Well, we can't catch up. We're way behind.
[42:20.000 --> 42:27.000]  And it's because just our own people knowing about this has completely swamped our supply lines.
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  And I'm sure with my Patriot Supplies, you said, what, three to four weeks now is the wait time.
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  Wait till the masses wake up. The supply lines will be so swamped that you won't be able to get anything at that point.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  Absolutely. I mean, look, I know what I'm going to do today before I go to CPAC.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  I'm going to the store, not just the extra my Patriot I've ordered. I'm ordering more from them myself.
[42:46.000 --> 42:51.000]  I do get a better discount. I'm going to go and buy more food because I'm going to buy more ammo.
[42:51.000 --> 43:17.000]  You can tell 2020 is crazy. We all need to be self-sufficient. Stay with us.

[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy. They're trying to start wars. They're trying to overthrow the president.
[44:08.000 --> 44:15.000]  They're trying to silence free speech. They're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[44:15.000 --> 44:24.000]  We, the people, have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[45:24.000 --> 45:31.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[45:31.000 --> 45:43.000]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen. And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.

[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  They're going to ship. They're going to just ship in 10 to 14 days. We're helping people prepare.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  It's just something you cover.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  Absolutely. You like to eat daily. And so we're just backing that up. It's the best insurance out there.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[46:45.000 --> 46:54.000]  It's normal to sit on top of horrible food and guns. All our forebears did it. We've got food. We've got guns. We've got Jesus. We know how to use it.
[46:54.000 --> 47:16.000]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex. It's real simple. Noah prepared.
[47:24.000 --> 47:32.000]  Again, I always follow my gut. Well, as I got older, I learned to always follow it because it's never wrong.
[47:32.000 --> 47:44.000]  But it can know something bad's coming, but it can misjudge what the bad thing is. That's the thing about intuition or the spirit, is that it knows what's going on beyond the veil.
[47:44.000 --> 47:52.000]  You're only trying to interpret it, and then you can get it wrong. But ever since this virus thing got announced five weeks ago, I've had a really bad feeling.
[47:52.000 --> 48:02.000]  Now, we know it's more deadly than the Chai comms first said. Well, they lie in sesame. But we were thinking maybe it's something else they're doing, or a binary weapon, or it's just a power grab.
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.000]  Well, yeah, they're not letting a good crisis go to waste. And they did buy it from a North Carolina university, and that's all admitted.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  Five years ago, Obama allowed that. What a scandal.
[48:12.000 --> 48:23.000]  But the quarantining and the freaking out over it, is it a global drill? As governments worry about a global stock market crash, is it meant to give them an excuse to have a correction now?
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  Because it's the concerted effort worldwide by these governments, except for the U.S.
[48:28.000 --> 48:39.000]  There's a lot of pieces that point towards this targeting Trump and nationalists, and we even have globalist models where they said a decade ago and a few years ago,
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.000]  oh, there'll be global pandemics. That'll help bring in world government and global migrant flows, which the UN organizes.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  Then when the crisis happens, they manage it and take control globally.
[48:51.000 --> 48:57.000]  So they admit they want to use global financial crises, global pandemic and global migrant waves, as well as war.
[48:57.000 --> 49:04.000]  But those four things total, they usually mentioned the first three, but war as well, to submit their central control.
[49:04.000 --> 49:11.000]  So that's why this is happening. The question is, is it the big power grab that's got me feeling really concerned and got you concerned?
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.000]  Or is it that the virus is really super deadly and it's out of control? Or is it both?
[49:17.000 --> 49:25.000]  Mike Adams, smartguynaturalnews.com. You've been on the cutting edge of this, along with Dr. Boyle and our others.
[49:25.000 --> 49:28.000]  That's what we have on us, folks, that have great track records.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  The mainstream media knows all this, too. They've just been covering it up.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  What's going to happen to them as it comes out, as it is now, that it's man-made and they covered it up?
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  That's just more discrediting to them. But meanwhile, we're censored.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  Well, this is really a fourth turning type of event here, where you have widespread loss of any remaining faith in institutions,
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  especially the institution of government and public health ministries in Japan, for example,
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  that let thousands of potentially infected people walk off a cruise ship into the Tokyo airport.
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  So we are seeing totally incompetent government at one level, but then completely deceptive government at another level.
[50:05.000 --> 50:12.000]  For example, today, we had a lawmaker this morning, USA Time, in Iran, say that there were 50 deaths in Iran.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  Immediately, the government of Iran came out and said, no, that's not true. There aren't 50 deaths.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  There are only, I think, what do they say, 12 or something in that range?
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  Well, the local lawmaker knows more than the central government. He knows.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  And by the way, this confirms what I had said actually on your show yesterday.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  I confirmed that there were rumors of 20 confirmed deaths in a hospital there now.
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  Well, let me just say, I mean, I talked to somebody who is actually in real operations in the CIA,
[50:38.000 --> 50:44.000]  not just some bureaucrat pencil pusher, and they said, look, it's really hitting Iran bad and it's really bad in Europe.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  And that's the intel they're getting from sources in Europe is, no, this thing's really deadly.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  I probably should have announced that at the start of the show.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  Here's how to do the math on this. If you think that the death rate is 2%,
[50:55.000 --> 51:04.000]  which is what the WHO is telling us, then 50 deaths in Iran would equate to, like, 2,500 infected people.
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  But that's two weeks ago or three weeks ago because it takes two to three weeks to die.
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  So in other words, Iran had, let's say, 2,500 infections two weeks ago.
[51:13.000 --> 51:19.000]  And since it's doubling every week, Iran has about 10,000 infections right now today.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  That's how you really work the math on this.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  And if Iran has 10,000 infections, it's already all over the Middle East.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  It's spreading to nearby nations. It just hasn't been diagnosed yet.
[51:29.000 --> 51:34.000]  And I think a similar situation, though not as severe, is happening in America.
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  I keep hammering this. There's going to be a day when the CDC comes out and says, well, we have to admit it.
[51:39.000 --> 51:45.000]  We've got 100 infections in Seattle or 100 infections in Honolulu, whatever the city might be.
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.000]  When that day comes, when they can no longer cover it up, it's already weeks too late.
[51:50.000 --> 51:57.000]  Because by that time, you've got infected people, asymptomatic carriers who have spread it to thousands of other people.
[51:57.000 --> 52:03.000]  Remember this one woman who went to church in South Korea spread it to, what, 600 people or something?
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  And that's just because they have more of a free reporting system there.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  So does Italy. It's not communist China, so the news got out.
[52:09.000 --> 52:15.000]  So clearly, it's super communicable, spreads really easy, and has a higher kill rate.
[52:15.000 --> 52:19.000]  Now do you think the Landsat study that was at what, 15% or so death rate, is that accurate?
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Or do we have any numbers to give us an idea?
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  Well, my best take right now is that if you get good medical care, if you're among the first to be infected,
[52:27.000 --> 52:35.000]  your death rate might only be 2% or 3% because you're getting good hospital care, intravenous fluids, antiviral drugs, things that work.
[52:35.000 --> 52:42.000]  But if you're in a situation where the hospitals are overrun, then the death rate skyrockets to 15% to 17%.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  That's my best guess currently based on the information. It's subject to change.
[52:46.000 --> 52:52.000]  But you see, we only have about a quarter of a million free hospital beds in the United States across the whole country.
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.000]  And almost none of those are isolation beds. So they can't really be used for this.
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.000]  The number of isolation beds is so small that even Travis Air Force Base has already run out of isolation.
[53:02.000 --> 53:10.000]  I want to talk about how bad the current evidence shows it mathematically could be, but let's just back up for a minute.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  Why would the UN, I know I keep repeating the same thing, thousands of news things to cover, literally, but I want to go back to this.
[53:16.000 --> 53:24.000]  Why would the UN and all these governments praise China, shooty women at the head,
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.000]  and welding people into their homes and burning bodies and mobile cremation vans.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  And then Trump goes, maybe three weeks ago we should block flies from China.
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  And they go, how dare you use xenophobe demon? The head of the UN says.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  So that's what you were saying even earlier. They're incubating in China and then sending in here to attack us.
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  Why the hell would the UN and China lockstep say you better take our people? What the hell is going on here?
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.000]  That's pretty obvious, like 12 monkeys where the dude's trying to get on an airplane with a bio weapon.
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  Absolutely. I'm glad you raised this point because I wanted to address it anyway.
[53:59.000 --> 54:06.000]  The WHO is a front for communist China. The WHO has been infiltrated and taken over by the communists.
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.000]  And the WHO is covering for China. They sent a mission of people there to investigate China.
[54:11.000 --> 54:16.000]  And all they came out with was positive stories about what a great job China is doing.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  China is covering this up and they have been from the very beginning.
[54:19.000 --> 54:26.000]  They've placed the world health at risk because of their inability to tell the truth about what was happening domestically.
[54:26.000 --> 54:33.000]  And by the way, now on any given day in China, get this, if you're a citizen in China, last week you were at gunpoint,
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.000]  marched home and welded shut in your apartment building and told you can't leave.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  Today you're marched at gunpoint back to the factory.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  They're told you have to work to keep the economy running.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  Hey, tomorrow you might be marched back home at gunpoint.
[54:47.000 --> 54:53.000]  I mean, it's just military control, gunpoint, mandatory, everything, and it's insane.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  There's no consistent policy. There's no truth telling.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  And the WHO is covering that up.
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  And the WHO, in my opinion, is involved in criminal negligence over this.
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  Those people should be arrested in the world court for covering this up and placing the entire world at risk.
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.000]  It's that bad. The WHO is a criminal organization, in my opinion, in their handling of this situation.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  They're lying to everybody.
[55:17.000 --> 55:25.000]  Now, let's talk about this, and then hopefully you can do a couple more segments, and then we've got Joel Scowles in the World of First Brief joining us.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  Yes, obviously, we sell high quality, swarable food.
[55:28.000 --> 55:38.000]  But to me, it's a big story, just like DrudgeReport.com is linked to the article in the video from Info Wars about the store shelves in Italy being empty in northern Italy and martial law.
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  The fact that government's been buying up all the swarable food except from our company, literally, that's why I went and gots the best folks while we're still operating.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  That's our strategic plan, is to bring you the best.
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  Plus, it works for us to have who's got the best ratings and has the food on hand to actually get it to you.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  You know, win-win, not fly-by-night.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  We want a long-term relationship with you. We want a pro-human future.
[55:56.000 --> 56:06.000]  But it's huge to me to know that government and corporations has been buying up all the swarable food for five weeks, and it's all basically gone.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  And now, even some store shelves in the U.S. around military bases, we've confirmed, are empty with the military buying it up.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  So they know something big's coming. That, to me, is a big bellwether.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Well, it's huge, and it's going to be more than just the food.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  It's going to be the medicine of vitamin C, of course.
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.000]  Most vitamin C is produced in China, and vitamin C, intravenous therapy, is already showing promise.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  That may be the cure for this, is to go to a clinic, get intravenous vitamin C.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  Most people are deficient in vitamin C every day.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  But again, most of it comes out of China.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  Most of it's actually GMO, not that that's relevant in this life-saving situation.
[56:39.000 --> 56:47.000]  By the way, I'm not a big medical type guy, but I have gotten intermediate vitamin C to detoxify my cell.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  I did it a few years ago. Amazing.
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  People should find reputable places, and you really should do it.
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  Well, yeah. And also, we're about to publish a story about a Chinese herbal formula from Chinese medicine
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  that's being used by a hospital in Beijing having great success from the world of Chinese medicine.
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.000]  We've talked about certain spices and herbs and nutrients that are very potent antivirals.
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  I mean, elderberry extract is one that everybody knows about, or they should.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Dandelion root is antiviral, okay?
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  There are antivirals all over the natural world.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  People should be thinking, along with food, yeah, you got to eat,
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  but you might want to start getting some of this natural medicine before everybody else.
[57:23.000 --> 57:30.000]  Let's talk briefly about what's known to boost immune systems out there with mycadems.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  Then we'll talk about what's coming next.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  If this is bad, as it looks like it may be, what will the U.S. look like in a month?
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  When does it peak in China? When does it peak here?
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  Mycadems is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, second hour coming up, newswords.com.
[57:43.000 --> 58:12.000]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  Now, the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them,
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time,
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  they do what they're going to say they're going to do,
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[58:26.000 --> 58:29.000]  Now, they were saying seven to ten days before shipping, because they've got the food,
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  but they've got to package it record-level orders.
[58:31.000 --> 58:36.000]  Now, it's 10 to 14, because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  So, get your orders at an infowarstore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first,
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  they're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well.
[58:43.000 --> 59:12.000]  So, get prepared, infowarstore.com with Swarble Foods.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  The Spirit of Resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  And so, it's very simple.
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  If you don't want to be slaves, and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  I want to attack.
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  I want to go after the globalists.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you
[59:36.000 --> 59:40.000]  and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[59:40.000 --> 59:45.000]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I've got for us, for myself and my family, for your family,
[59:45.000 --> 59:50.000]  because we're in this together, infowarstore.com.
[59:50.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  You know, I don't feel guilty being pre-positioned for what you see happening right now.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  Even mainstream media actually.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  How is Jones pre-positioned for these crises?
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Well, I mean, I've got an instant access shotgun safe right by my bed in every bedroom I sleep in.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Sometimes I wake my wife up snoring.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  I've got a gun safe in each room right there.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  And I'm not living in fear.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  I'm actually living the opposite.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  You're breaking my house.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  You're dead.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  I'm pre-positioned.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  And of course, I want to have a food sponsor that's high quality and delivers and people like,
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  because I want you to like it.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Just like, I want to like it.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I want to steer you in a good direction.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  If you asked me if you were new in town, hey, what's a great steakhouse?
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  I'd tell you the good steakhouse, because I want you to steer me right, too.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  That's just common sense.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  But I'll tell you, selfishly, for myself and my family, I want to know,
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  because Mike Adams is one of the top expert herbologists, his wife's an expert in it.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  He's a top publisher in it.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  What I can do to dose myself.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  I'm already doing the I&I.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  I'm already doing the DNA force, the CoQ10, the PQQ, all that.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  I get my children elderberry.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  I'm already getting a lot of vitamin C.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  I like to eat orange peel.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  I eat orange.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  What else can I do?
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  What else can folks do to boost their immunity out there?
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Well, there are just a huge number of things.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Look at these exotic spices, for example, curries, and they contain curcumin,
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  which is one of the phytochemicals found in turmeric root.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  This is, if you look at the research out there, it's very clear that this can help.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  I mean, I got to be careful from a regulatory point of view what I can say on the show.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  You can't tell folks that you need oxygen to live or you need water to live,
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  or that turmeric's great.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  It's insane.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I'm about to publish a story probably tomorrow that shows there's a chart of research.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  They looked at, after the SARS pandemic or epidemic a few years ago,
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  they looked at all the functional foods.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  This is research out of China and Taiwan.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  All the functional foods and which molecules had had the biggest effect
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  at preventing the biological activity of SARS virus, which is a coronavirus back then.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  And it's very clear.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I mean, there's a chart.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  You can see which foods worked and which foods didn't work.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Basically, the foods that worked are really these pungent, exotic spices.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  You talk about Lebanese food and Indian food and Afghan food.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Middle Eastern food is loaded with these spices.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Really, the people in the Middle East, if they would stick to their ethnic food,
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  they would really have more resistance from this.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  But when they're eating the Western diet,
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  when you start eating processed carbohydrates and high fructose corn syrup
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  white bread and all this garbage that people live on in America, for the most part,
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  and now it's exported to the Philippines and Taiwan and South America and everywhere,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  it's insane.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  I remember when I lived in South America, the people in Ecuador,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  they loved to eat American processed foods
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  and the grocery stores were being taken over by processed American foods.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  That was insane.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  I told them, eat your local food, your local cuisine,
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  because that's what has kept you healthy this entire time.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Now, of course, obesity and heart disease and diabetes is skyrocketing
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  and those are co-factors with this coronavirus epidemic.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  If you already have heart disease or already have respiratory disease
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  or low vitamin D, you have maybe tuberculosis, you have respiratory problems,
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  you are far more likely to die.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  So it's about having overall health and you can achieve that through food
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  and through just fresh herbs and fruits and vegetables and supplements and superfoods.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  It's really incredibly easy to achieve a much higher state of health.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  But Alex, it's not that...
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  See, I think anybody can get prepared to survive this from a health point of view.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  The real question is, can we survive the economic collapse?
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Stay there.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  That was my next question.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  Our final segment with Mike Adams is, any way you slice it, it's a man-made virus.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  That's incredible.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Okay, we're vindicated.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  So what?
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Who cares about being vindicated if your kids get sick or you die or things like that happen?
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  So yeah, why the giant response?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Who's it really aimed at?
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  The media celebrating it might hurt our economy and hurt Trump.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  How do they get away with that?
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  We know they're discredited, but they've trained us to just do the most hateful, destructive things
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  and then they never get in trouble.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  I mean, if I was on air saying, I want the American economy to tank
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  and I think this country sucks, I would expect to be off air because no one would be listening.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  But instead, they just force shovel this at us and then a minority of people,
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I got to say it, mainly weirdo white people, that's what's at Bernie rallies, buy into it.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  And boy, that's another story on inforwars.com.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  We haven't gotten to how the Bernie people attacked us yesterday.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  That's why listeners to info wars need to be prepared.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  And infowarstore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier.
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  We have high quality, storable foods ready to ship and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  along with ultra 12 at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Knowledge is knowing how to fix a carburetor, how to roof a house or how to kick somebody's ass.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  But what is wisdom?
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Wisdom is when you can look at thousands of points of data and have enough experience
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  and enough connection to God.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  That's really what it is.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  It's discernment to then know through the fog like radar what's happening.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  And so I could go over a thousand points.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  I know you're all seeing it as well.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  A million points. It's indescribable.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Gut level.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  It's really just subconscious level.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Hundreds of times more powerful than the conscious brain.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  There's a spirit riding in that cockpit as well.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  That's the deep interface.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  This is the big move 2020.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  The move on the economy, the move on nationalists, the move for a police state crackdown,
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  which again, not what the left says the average cop is bad.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  Ending due process, martial law, that's a police state.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  And the globalists want that. And the left wants that.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  We went to a burning rally yesterday.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And I had women come up and say, hug and then hit me.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  But from up close, they've been trained to do it down low.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  And then they'd elbow me.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  And they'd come in and say, oh, you know, your security's assaulting me.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  And then I left and Owen was put in the free speech area 200 yards away.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  The police were nice, but they said, hey, go over there.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  They all came over and attacked Owen and split one of the security guys.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  He's a great guy.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Lives here in the U.S. now.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  He's an Austrian military and a patriot split in between the eyes, three stitches.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  And we're just attacking everyone and trying to hit Owen.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  And he got some of those little punches in and they go, hug, hug, hug.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  And there's video of this on inforwars.com.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Paul Watson wrote about it.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  It's on thenationalfall.com.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  When they get in close and they start elbowing you, they start kneeing you,
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  they start spitting on you.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And they usually, and I'm not doing this to be funny, folks, the men walk over
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and they go, they go, and then they'll start saying, I like kids.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  I like kids.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I like kids.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  And there's a lot of videos when they try to lick me.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  And that can be in New York.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  I can be in Austin.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  And they come over and they say, I want the children.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  I like children.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  And you think, oh, that's just a few of the nutcases.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  No, 90% of them look like they escaped from a mental institution.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  So that footage is coming up next segment.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  We had to beep it.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  It sounds like beep, beep, beep, beep.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Because that's also all they do is cuss.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  But giant fat women who never worked a day in their life screaming,
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  they want to live in Venezuela.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  The reason I raised that, Mike Adams, you talk about, hey, the virus
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  killing you is not the issue on average of your healthy.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  It's the hysteria.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  And what's already hit Europe and whatever governments are doing,
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  whether it's totally real or hyped up, we know it's manmade,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  is the cultural time bomb.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  Because to watch probably 20,000, 30,000 people.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  It wasn't as big as our gun rally in Virginia, but it was big.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Pour out of the sewers like roaches pouring out.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  And I'm not being mean here, but everybody wants to make things racial.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  They were almost all white people that look like they escaped
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  from a mental institution and some Hispanics who act like they
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  escaped from mental institutions.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  And I'm like, and they're all like, we're going to kill you.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Yes, we're taking over.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Forget undercover veritas.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  We have video where I'm like, do you want to kill us?
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Yes, I'm going to kill you women.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Big fat women that couldn't fight their way.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but I can take on 200 of them to give
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  them swords, give me a sword.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  I mean, they were a joke.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  And I didn't feel powerful seeing how dehumanized they were.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  It was actually a frightening horde of people that acted
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  and looked like zombies.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  What the hell is going on, Mike Adams?
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Well, you bring up a really important point.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  The mental health collision with the coronavirus pandemic
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  and the quarantines.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  I saw a haunting video last night.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  You probably won't be able to find this easily.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  It was in Chinese.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  And it was just a video filmed in Wuhan of all the apartment
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  buildings at night in the background and the screams,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  the haunting blood curdling screams from people,
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  the mental anguish people losing their minds.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  I will.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  Yeah, we've got the link, but it's in Chinese.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  But it's just, it's like a scene out of the horrors of hell.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  It's like a hellscape from a dystopian sci-fi movie.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  It's unreal.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  And it made me fearful for what this is going to do to mental
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  health as this spreads from city to city to city.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  And you just nailed it.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  When you take these deranged lunatic, violent leftists who
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  are already mentally ill, I mean, they're already gone.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  And you add a quarantine to that.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  What's going to happen to their state of mental health?
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  What are they then willing to do in terms of violence or looting
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  or murder or killing or rape or pedophilia or all the things
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  that they do almost on everyday basis?
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Anyway, add the coronavirus to that.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  You start looking at the downfall of society.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  And the thing is, it's easy to see where this is going if you
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  just do the math.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  For example, yesterday, Mad Mike Hughes, the Flat Earth
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  rocket builder guy, you know, he died yesterday.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  Sadly, I always admire people who are inventors who are willing
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  to build things and think big.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  I mean, I think he's wrong about his conclusions,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  but he's willing to do something.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  I admire that in people.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  He died because at launch, the parachute came off of his rocket.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Now, for the next minute of flight, everything would have
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  seemed fine.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  You feel weightless after the acceleration's over.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  You're on a parabolic drift back down to the earth, you know.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  And there's no problem until you impact the ground and then
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  you're dead.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Well, this is where we are with the coronavirus.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  The parachute's gone.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  This is out of containment.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  We are now on a rocket ship where the economy is going to crash
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  and burn.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Anybody can see it if you can do the math, but most people are
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  just saying, well, I don't feel any problems yet.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  It feels weightless.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Everything's fine here.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  It's because they're just not thinking ahead two months or
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  three months.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  I think the one thing that sets us apart, Alex, and why we are
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  preppers and why your audience is preppers is because we can
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  think ahead.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  You know, the average leftist out there doesn't think about, oh,
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  what would happen if we elect Bernie Sanders?
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  What would happen if we have communism?
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  They can't plan ahead at all.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  They live in the now and they don't have any cerebral cortex
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  function to plan ahead.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And their domestication, their softness, their weakness is
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  like a shield.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I mean, I know I'm soft compared to my, you know, say my dad's
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  dad, it was, you know, farmer could do everything.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  That's why hearing Bloomberg make fun of farmers.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Like, you have any idea what farmers do?
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Electricity and digging wells and fixing things and
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  birthing calves and, you know, working when you're sick and
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  bailing the hay.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I mean, it was just like, you just stick a seed in the ground
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  compared to those type of folks and people I still know in my
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  family that our farmers that have a job in town at the power
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  plant and still run a farm and still run cattle to pay all the
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  bills.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And then I hear him talking crap about and then I compare that
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  to those Bernie people.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  I didn't feel powerful seeing the Bernie people looking like a
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  bunch of brain dead slums.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  It made me feel weak that we've allowed ourselves to fall to
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  this level.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  You feel sad for humanity, but you also realize that when
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  those unprepared people panic, they turn incredibly dangerous
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  locust.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Absolutely.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Oh, hey, good.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  They are like human locusts at that point.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Just, just going across the city, stripping everything bare,
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  raiding your home, looting, pillaging, everything they can do
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  because they did not prepare because they were never informed.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  The media lied to them.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And they believe they're supposed to get everything free.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  Well, of course, of course, Alex, you're wrong for preparing.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  You've hoarded supplies that belong to the community.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Don't you know that?
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  How dare you?
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  What are you?
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  You think you're special?
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Why?
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Because I have epigenetic instincts to be prepared like my
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  forebears did as a, as just a, not even a leader, just a
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  competent person would do that because we're competent.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  We're bad.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Well, that's it.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  I'm, I'm done with the show, Alex.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I'm not going to be on with people who take other people's stuff
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  in advance.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  That's it.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  That's, that's the end of it.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  No more preparing.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  It's so horrible.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  It's so bad.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  Bernie Sanders for president.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Exactly.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Mike Adams, you're going to be, you're going to be co-hosting the
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  show Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday with Alan Keys.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  I'm going to be popping in live from CPAC with breaking news.
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  I'm almost not going to go to CPAC, but we already worked with
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  some folks to get some really big ballrooms and have some big
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  events.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And it's important for free speech to get the president's
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  attention.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  But this is all coronavirus now, obviously with the economy and
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  the rest of it.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  But I'm going to feel really good knowing that you're going to be
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  here co-hosting the first hour and a half of the show.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  Then your colleague, who you helped bring on air again, and
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  a good job doing that, Alan Keys, who's host over at brightdion.com.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  You're a great independent media site.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  He'll be hosting the second half and then we'll have the first hour.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Francis Boyle on Wednesday.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  Francis Boyle on Wednesday.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  I'll be interviewing him in the second hour.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  And he's got big news, but he's so dedicated to his students.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  I'm not saying he's wrong.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  I mean, in this crisis, I'd say, hey students, here's your, you know,
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  the props coming in or one of the other students is going to teach
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  the next two days, but he's dedicated.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  He's committed to it.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  He's got all these other professors that mail it in, so he'll be with you
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  Wednesday at 11.30.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  All right, Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Thank you so much, sir.

[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  before purchasing. Not an offer to buy or sell the security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  Keith Bansomer powers the great line of high-quality, durable food we have available
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  at readyhourandmfourstore.com.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  And yes, we're selling durable food here, but concerns me is we're a month into this
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  You've never seen anything like this.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  Never, never like this and sustained.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  It started 27 days ago and it kind of went hyper and it doesn't fall off.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  Even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  The semis are rolling, the chips are in, we're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  Orders that are getting in today, they're going to ship.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  They're going to just ship in 10 to 14 days. We're helping people prepare.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  It's just something you cover.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Absolutely. You like to eat daily and so we're just backing that up.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  It's the best insurance out there.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  It's normal to sit on top of durable food and guns. All our forebears did it.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  We've got food, we've got guns, we've got Jesus, we know how to use it.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex. It's real simple.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  NOAA prepared.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Coronavirus deals a major blow to German car factories in China.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  They're reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  That's how major this is.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band.video and infowars.com today.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  OK, got a big announcement here to make.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  And then we're going to get into the frothing viciousness of Bernie Sanders supporters
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  and just how devastated they look.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  Everyone knows what a mental patient looks like.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  There's an archetypal bozo hair, crazy gibbering, making weird faces, violent.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  It was frightening and really depressing.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  And I'm going to just be honest, I'm a tough guy.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  At least I think I am.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  I had nightmares last night about the Bernie people because there were little sick knots
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  of young college students who were all professional managing the mental patients.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  And you can see the looks in their eyes like they knew they were part of a scum operation,
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  that they were hurting a bunch of lunatics.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  So I'm going to get to it in a minute.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  I'm freaked out.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  You've got to go to a burning event.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  You've got to smell it.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  You've got to see it.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  A large percentage of them had pissed their pants.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  That's a thing in these weird leftist things is they like to crap on themselves and stuff.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  I mean, it was disgusting, man.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  There were adults wearing diapers.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  I don't mean old people that had medical problems.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  You just can't describe it.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  I kept being like, I'm smelling crap.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  And I was like, these people are crapping themselves.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  And I'm not like some germaphobe country club, goody two shoes person.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  I mean, I can go in a gas station bathroom if I need to and not give a crap.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  But this is like gas station bathroom to the two or three levels up.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  There's like a spiritual gas station bathroom and the vacantness and the mental illness.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  And it was just like, because you see a mentally ill person.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  It's disturbing in the grocery store line.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  Imagine being surrounded by 25,000 of them that want to kill you.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Just briefly, you heard Mike Adams.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  He said, wait till the general public figures out what's happened with coronavirus and tries to buy food.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  It'll all be gone.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  That's what happened.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  I just talked to my Patriot supply.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  That's why they're up to four weeks now to deliver.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  They said, fine, you can tell your audience three weeks for another hour or so.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  And that's coming up here in a minute, but three to four weeks to get it.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  M4warstore.com.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  They run the whole system.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  They've got it.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  They've still got food.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Get yours in today.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  And it supports the M4 with all this craziness.
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  It's time to have storable food.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Okay.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Let's go ahead and go to this report.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  It's on m4wars.com.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  If you're a radio listener and dare to look at these goblins, but journalist attacked by violent Bernie Bros.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  in Austin, Texas.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  Here's the video.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  What's going on?
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  Bernie Sanders is going to run the Democrats.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  Bernie Sanders let the Democrats deal with election in 2016.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  We got reached over and punched him in the head.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  We're going to find that guy legally.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  Bernie Sanders allowed the Democrats to steal the election from him in 2016.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  And he's going to let the Democrats steal the election from him again.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  When Bernie Sanders let the Democrats steal the election from him in 2016, he said nothing.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  Now, again, we've been inside their grips for hours, but the police told us, okay, he's getting ready to be here.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  I left you to the show.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  They said, go back behind there.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  It's a free speech.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  So he's 200 yards away from even the event and they come to attacking and it's about to start.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And they had American flags up and Texas flags.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  They go, he's not a communist.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Here they come.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  These goblins attacked.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  Bernie Sanders let Hillary Clinton win the election.
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Bernie Sanders is going to let Michael Blumann steal the election.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.400]  Three health care, make Dr. Sleeves.
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:15.000]  Three health care, make Dr. Sleeves.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.400]  You see the Marty Security saying,
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:19.200]  if you're going to protest, stay back there, which we were.
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:23.000]  But even to their own minions, now they link arms and attack.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.200]  Three health care, make Dr. Sleeves.
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:28.100]  They start grabbing you, hugging you, humping you.
[1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:30.400]  That woman's breath was reportedly horrible.
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:32.100]  Thirty Sanders is a fraud.
[1:25:32.100 --> 1:25:33.500]  The poor security guys.
[1:25:33.500 --> 1:25:34.500]  They're all a bunch of army vets.
[1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:36.700]  The poor guys got put up with this.
[1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:39.200]  Thirty Sanders is a fraud.
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:43.600]  F***ing Sanders let Hillary Clinton steal the election in 2016.
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:46.800]  And he's going to elect Mike Bloomberg doing it again.
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:52.100]  F***ing Sanders let the Democrats steal the election in 2016.
[1:25:52.100 --> 1:25:54.600]  Easy, bro. Easy, easy, easy.
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:59.300]  That guy did a left hook over and punched the security guy right in between the eyes.
[1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:00.200]  And I'll give it to him.
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:02.600]  Big guy comes over, just punches the security guy right in the face.
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:04.500]  But we didn't do anything.
[1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:07.000]  Nice and sturdy guy, blood pouring out of his face.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.100]  But that's who these commies are, folks.
[1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:12.200]  Another radical communist.
[1:26:12.200 --> 1:26:15.000]  Another radical communist Bernie supporter.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.400]  Look at how crazy you guys are.
[1:26:17.400 --> 1:26:19.800]  Look at how crazy you are.
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:22.400]  Look at how crazy these people are.
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:24.300]  Look at the radical commies out here.
[1:26:24.300 --> 1:26:28.500]  Now this guy starts licking and grabbing.
[1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:29.900]  Saying weird stuff.
[1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:31.900]  Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:36.000]  I mean, if you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.100]  They all are like, art typal.
[1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:41.500]  If you wanted to make a movie about mental patients,
[1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:44.500]  you would just go to a Bernie rally and just every person would be perfect.
[1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:47.000]  Let's steal the election in 2016.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:48.300]  F***ing Sanders let the Democrats steal the election in 2016.
[1:26:48.300 --> 1:26:52.500]  This poor security guy with his face spoiled out and is full of his job.
[1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.000]  It's against the law. It's against the law.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.500]  One more.
[1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:57.800]  Can you cite the section?
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:26:59.500]  There's a guy that punched the guy in the face.
[1:26:59.500 --> 1:27:02.400]  They didn't know what happened. He didn't make a big deal about it.
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:04.900]  We didn't know he was bleeding for about a minute.
[1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:10.400]  This is when the goblin women attack.
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:12.300]  Now a bunch of fat goblin women,
[1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:15.300]  who should go spend a month in Venezuela and they lose some weight.
[1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:18.300]  No food there.
[1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:20.400]  Here come our world rulers.
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:21.900]  The goblins.
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:23.400]  Welcome to every county in this country.
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:25.900]  Shut up! Shut up!
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:28.900]  Shut up! Shut up!
[1:27:28.900 --> 1:27:31.500]  And they go, hug, hug me for squeezing you and hitting you.
[1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:33.300]  Shut up! Hug! Hug!
[1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:34.600]  Bernie Sanders has been out!
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:37.400]  Yo, let's hug them. Watch the hugging starts.
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:39.300]  Then they go, don't assault me.
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:46.300]  Bernie Sanders let the Democrats steal the election in 2016.
[1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.300]  And they're going to steal it from him again.
[1:27:48.300 --> 1:27:49.800]  F***ing Sanders!
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:51.300]  Go! Go!
[1:27:51.300 --> 1:27:53.300]  Go the f***ing way!
[1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:54.600]  Go the f***ing way!
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:57.300]  Go the f***ing way!
[1:27:57.300 --> 1:27:58.200]  Don't touch me.
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:00.500]  Don't get close to me, mother f***er.
[1:28:00.500 --> 1:28:02.100]  You're not close to me, really?
[1:28:02.100 --> 1:28:05.400]  So she runs over, bounces her 300 pounds into him.
[1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:07.100]  She's about five feet tall, 300 pounds.
[1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:08.100]  F*** off.
[1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:09.100]  F*** off!
[1:28:09.100 --> 1:28:10.100]  And then she starts attacking.
[1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:11.100]  F*** you!
[1:28:11.100 --> 1:28:12.100]  Kneeling elbowing.
[1:28:12.100 --> 1:28:14.100]  You! F*** you!
[1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:16.100]  Go! Go!
[1:28:16.100 --> 1:28:18.100]  Back the f*** up!
[1:28:18.100 --> 1:28:19.600]  Back the f*** up!
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:21.600]  Back the f*** up!
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:23.400]  Top 20, 20.
[1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:25.100]  Top 20, 20.
[1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:26.600]  Top 20, 20.
[1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:29.100]  So that's how America works now.
[1:28:29.100 --> 1:28:31.600]  People that can't even wipe their ass,
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:33.900]  it's a just physically attack whoever they want,
[1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:37.200]  led by a big, fat, dirty communist.
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:38.900]  So that's what America's turned into.
[1:28:38.900 --> 1:28:39.700]  That's what it is.
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:41.200]  And we were restrained.
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:42.900]  Because we're not violent, dirty communists.
[1:28:42.900 --> 1:28:44.800]  But let me tell you, you dirty communists,
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:46.700]  you get your physical war going?
[1:28:46.700 --> 1:28:47.900]  Ha!
[1:28:47.900 --> 1:28:49.200]  Ha, ha, ha.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:53.200]  You're not going to last 10 seconds, you big, fat, dumbasses.
[1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:54.200]  Hello, patriots.
[1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:55.700]  My name is Todd Savage,
[1:28:55.700 --> 1:28:58.200]  founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[1:28:58.200 --> 1:29:00.700]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out-left sanctuary state,
[1:29:00.700 --> 1:29:03.200]  until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:05.700]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead
[1:29:05.700 --> 1:29:08.700]  where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children
[1:29:08.700 --> 1:29:11.200]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[1:29:11.200 --> 1:29:12.700]  If you're ready to flee the city
[1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:14.700]  to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,
[1:29:14.700 --> 1:29:16.700]  our BlackRifle Real Estate team is here to help.

[1:30:23.700 --> 1:30:24.700]  and it's fresh.
[1:30:24.700 --> 1:30:27.700]  That's why you have to wait 10 to 14 days for it to get delivered.
[1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:28.700]  Not because they don't have the food,
[1:30:28.700 --> 1:30:30.200]  but because they've got to package it,
[1:30:30.200 --> 1:30:33.200]  and their factories are going 24 hours a day.
[1:30:33.200 --> 1:30:36.200]  High-quality fresh food, the best package systems,
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:38.200]  tastes great, protects you and your family,
[1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:39.700]  and funds the InfoWare.

[1:30:51.700 --> 1:31:20.700]  you are the resistance.
[1:31:21.700 --> 1:31:23.700]  It is back in stock.
[1:31:23.700 --> 1:31:25.700]  You can get them both individually
[1:31:25.700 --> 1:31:28.700]  for 40% off right now
[1:31:28.700 --> 1:31:32.700]  and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[1:31:32.700 --> 1:31:34.700]  This makes your life so much better
[1:31:34.700 --> 1:31:37.700]  when you have a good multivitamin mineral
[1:31:37.700 --> 1:31:40.700]  that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[1:31:40.700 --> 1:31:42.700]  And of course, vitamin B12
[1:31:42.700 --> 1:31:45.700]  is the bedrock foundation of energy,
[1:31:45.700 --> 1:31:48.700]  stamina, libido, just everything.
[1:31:48.700 --> 1:31:49.700]  And they're both back in stock,
[1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:52.700]  40% off individually or 50% off
[1:31:52.700 --> 1:32:21.700]  when you get them together at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:23.700 --> 1:32:24.700]  It looks like duct tape,
[1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:25.700]  but it's just a regular stick.
[1:32:25.700 --> 1:32:26.700]  You put it over your mouth,
[1:32:26.700 --> 1:32:27.700]  you go to a Trump rally,
[1:32:27.700 --> 1:32:30.700]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[1:32:30.700 --> 1:32:31.700]  People say, why are you doing this?
[1:32:31.700 --> 1:32:32.700]  What's happening?
[1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:34.700]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[1:32:34.700 --> 1:32:35.700]  Trump won't do anything about it.
[1:32:35.700 --> 1:32:36.700]  And Dr. Pachennick,
[1:32:36.700 --> 1:32:37.700]  let me just ask you what you think,
[1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:39.700]  because I've not launched this yet.
[1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:40.700]  It's brilliant.
[1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:42.700]  You've taken the very element
[1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:44.700]  that they try to repress you with,
[1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:47.700]  that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[1:32:47.700 --> 1:32:50.700]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[1:32:50.700 --> 1:32:53.700]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[1:32:53.700 --> 1:33:22.700]  Silence.
[1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:27.700]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[1:33:27.700 --> 1:33:31.700]  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[1:33:31.700 --> 1:33:32.700]  We are back live.
[1:33:32.700 --> 1:33:35.700]  Joel Scalzen came on, on very short notice,
[1:33:35.700 --> 1:33:36.700]  worldaffairsbrief.com.
[1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:39.700]  He's the editor-in-chief of worldaffairsbrief.com.
[1:33:39.700 --> 1:33:44.700]  He is a former Marine Corps Naval Aviator and Officer,
[1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:45.700]  and he's a best-selling author,
[1:33:45.700 --> 1:33:50.700]  and he's renowned as the top guy for secure homes,
[1:33:50.700 --> 1:33:52.700]  and of course, for secure locations,
[1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:54.700]  and has several books on that subject.
[1:33:54.700 --> 1:33:55.700]  We shell one of them,
[1:33:55.700 --> 1:33:58.700]  a strategic relocation book and a film
[1:33:58.700 --> 1:33:59.700]  that we put together with him.
[1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:00.700]  We should shoot a new one and update it.
[1:34:00.700 --> 1:34:02.700]  He's been too busy to come do it,
[1:34:02.700 --> 1:34:04.700]  and so have I, but we need to get that done.
[1:34:04.700 --> 1:34:06.700]  But I wanted to get him on,
[1:34:06.700 --> 1:34:10.700]  because I do read the worldaffairsbrief
[1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:11.700]  when I get time to do it.
[1:34:11.700 --> 1:34:13.700]  But I just like to get him on,
[1:34:13.700 --> 1:34:15.700]  and hear what he has to say live on air about
[1:34:15.700 --> 1:34:16.700]  what's really behind this,
[1:34:16.700 --> 1:34:19.700]  because gut level is something big,
[1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:21.700]  but is the virus really as deadly as they're saying,
[1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:22.700]  or is it just hype,
[1:34:22.700 --> 1:34:24.700]  or is it a world government drill?
[1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:27.700]  Is Xi Jinping using it to attack the West
[1:34:27.700 --> 1:34:28.700]  and save face over Taiwan,
[1:34:28.700 --> 1:34:31.700]  and the fact that he lost the trade war?
[1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:34.700]  And why is the U.N. praising China
[1:34:34.700 --> 1:34:37.700]  for shooting people dead at checkpoints,
[1:34:37.700 --> 1:34:39.700]  but then saying weeks ago,
[1:34:39.700 --> 1:34:41.700]  we're bad for stopping flights?
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:42.700]  What's really behind it?
[1:34:42.700 --> 1:34:44.700]  Well, now the stock market's down at 1,000 points.
[1:34:44.700 --> 1:34:46.700]  Now, they're talking about Italy,
[1:34:46.700 --> 1:34:48.700]  martial law in the North.
[1:34:48.700 --> 1:34:51.700]  Anyway, you cut this, it's big.
[1:34:51.700 --> 1:34:53.700]  So let's talk to Joel Scowze
[1:34:53.700 --> 1:34:56.700]  and see what he thinks is really going on.
[1:34:56.700 --> 1:34:58.700]  Joel, thanks for joining us.
[1:34:58.700 --> 1:35:00.700]  Well, always a pleasure, Alex.
[1:35:00.700 --> 1:35:03.700]  My personal opinion after studying this
[1:35:03.700 --> 1:35:05.700]  is that this is backlash to China
[1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:09.700]  for purposely developing a weaponized coronavirus.
[1:35:09.700 --> 1:35:13.700]  That doesn't mean that it was in an ultimate weaponized form,
[1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:15.700]  but clearly they were working on it.
[1:35:15.700 --> 1:35:17.700]  I believe the Lancet article said,
[1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.700]  you know, they didn't have good control
[1:35:19.700 --> 1:35:21.700]  over disposal of gloves
[1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:24.700]  and other things in their weapons lab,
[1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:27.700]  and there's a big scavenger community in China
[1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:29.700]  that probably scavenged all these gloves,
[1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:31.700]  sold them to the fish market,
[1:35:31.700 --> 1:35:32.700]  and the meat market there,
[1:35:32.700 --> 1:35:34.700]  and that's where it started to spread.
[1:35:34.700 --> 1:35:39.700]  But it's very clear from the General Hao Ping article
[1:35:39.700 --> 1:35:41.700]  a couple of decades ago
[1:35:41.700 --> 1:35:43.700]  that they were planning on using chemical weapons
[1:35:43.700 --> 1:35:45.700]  to depopulate America.
[1:35:45.700 --> 1:35:48.700]  Long said, even with their nuclear preemptive strike
[1:35:48.700 --> 1:35:51.700]  on military targets, they don't want to hit cities per se.
[1:35:51.700 --> 1:35:53.700]  They want to blackmail the West into submission
[1:35:53.700 --> 1:35:55.700]  so that they can take the land,
[1:35:55.700 --> 1:35:57.700]  have, you know, the economy,
[1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:00.700]  have the grainaries and the other things
[1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:02.700]  which the U.S. provides without, you know,
[1:36:02.700 --> 1:36:04.700]  destroying the infrastructure.
[1:36:04.700 --> 1:36:05.700]  That's right.
[1:36:05.700 --> 1:36:07.700]  Communists always want to exploit and take over a country.
[1:36:07.700 --> 1:36:08.700]  They don't want to destroy it.
[1:36:08.700 --> 1:36:10.700]  They're consummate thieves.
[1:36:10.700 --> 1:36:12.700]  They want it.
[1:36:12.700 --> 1:36:13.700]  That's right.
[1:36:13.700 --> 1:36:16.700]  And so, you know, my first impression when I read that
[1:36:16.700 --> 1:36:18.700]  about China, you know, going to really use
[1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:20.700]  chemical, biological weapons against the U.S.,
[1:36:20.700 --> 1:36:23.700]  I thought, you know, I don't think God's going to allow this.
[1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:26.700]  And it's my personal opinion that this is backlaced,
[1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:28.700]  that this was allowed to leak out.
[1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:32.700]  It's a way for China to pay a heavy price
[1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:35.700]  for the development of these biologic...
[1:36:35.700 --> 1:36:36.700]  But let's be clear.
[1:36:36.700 --> 1:36:37.700]  Not a race-specific bioweapon
[1:36:37.700 --> 1:36:39.700]  or not something released by the U.S.
[1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:41.700]  God did this.
[1:36:41.700 --> 1:36:44.700]  Yeah, I think that the allowance of the release of it
[1:36:44.700 --> 1:36:47.700]  was to stop China's instructor,
[1:36:47.700 --> 1:36:49.700]  make China pay a huge price.
[1:36:49.700 --> 1:36:51.700]  And this is going to have a heavy price right now.
[1:36:51.700 --> 1:36:54.700]  Everything is really closing down in China.
[1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:56.700]  It's ending the Chinese century.
[1:36:56.700 --> 1:36:58.700]  It's ending the Chinese century.
[1:36:58.700 --> 1:37:00.700]  Yeah, now, whether or not the actual Communist Party
[1:37:00.700 --> 1:37:02.700]  will be overthrown, I have my doubts.
[1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:05.700]  They have so much power and so many, you know,
[1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:08.700]  they control all the police, all the law enforcement things.
[1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:10.700]  It's very difficult for people to rebel
[1:37:10.700 --> 1:37:13.700]  and overthrow the communists without any weapons.
[1:37:13.700 --> 1:37:16.700]  But still, it's going to set back their agenda,
[1:37:16.700 --> 1:37:19.700]  including their military agenda for a long time
[1:37:19.700 --> 1:37:22.700]  if this really continues to spread.
[1:37:22.700 --> 1:37:25.700]  Now, already we're seeing,
[1:37:25.700 --> 1:37:28.700]  and that's why the start market is down a thousand points,
[1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:31.700]  we're seeing shortages, supplies right now.
[1:37:31.700 --> 1:37:33.700]  Everything from Walmart is coming out of warehouses.
[1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:36.700]  They're not getting replaced from China.
[1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:38.700]  And so we're going to see, I think,
[1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:40.700]  a major disruption in the automobile industry
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:42.700]  because of so many Chinese parts.
[1:37:42.700 --> 1:37:44.700]  And this is a good thing, Alex,
[1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:46.700]  because it's going to break the dependency
[1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:50.700]  that the U.S. has unwittingly built upon Chinese products,
[1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:52.700]  including your military industrial complex.
[1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:55.700]  And they're going to have to find other sources now.
[1:37:55.700 --> 1:37:58.700]  And so I think this is a real blessing in disguise,
[1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:00.700]  even if it doesn't end up spreading
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:02.700]  to the rest of the world completely.
[1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:05.700]  Now, it is spreading rapidly in Iran,
[1:38:05.700 --> 1:38:08.700]  in Italy, as you have said,
[1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:10.700]  in South Korea, especially,
[1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:13.700]  which is an economic powerhouse,
[1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:15.700]  it's a manufacturing powerhouse for the United States.
[1:38:15.700 --> 1:38:18.700]  That industry is going to start shutting down pretty soon, too,
[1:38:18.700 --> 1:38:22.700]  if this continues to spread.
[1:38:22.700 --> 1:38:25.700]  Looking at this,
[1:38:25.700 --> 1:38:27.700]  gut level,
[1:38:27.700 --> 1:38:31.700]  which, again, is a distort of all the information we have,
[1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:34.700]  do you think it's going to have the effect
[1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:36.700]  of wounding the nation-state economies
[1:38:36.700 --> 1:38:38.700]  as the left has been hoping?
[1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:40.700]  As Bill Maher, a year ago, MSNBC,
[1:38:40.700 --> 1:38:42.700]  this week, last week,
[1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:44.700]  they're openly saying, we hope this hurts Trump.
[1:38:44.700 --> 1:38:46.700]  Separate from will it hurt the economy
[1:38:46.700 --> 1:38:49.700]  is how are they on TV
[1:38:49.700 --> 1:38:51.700]  rooting for a bad economy?
[1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:53.700]  Are they tone deaf,
[1:38:53.700 --> 1:38:55.700]  or I guess their audience, is that stupid?
[1:38:55.700 --> 1:38:58.700]  How do you say things like this?
[1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:00.700]  Well, you know, I've always predicted
[1:39:00.700 --> 1:39:02.700]  that the establishment was going to try to pull down
[1:39:02.700 --> 1:39:04.700]  the economy, not in a collapse,
[1:39:04.700 --> 1:39:07.700]  because that never happens without a destructive war,
[1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:10.700]  but at least a stock market fall,
[1:39:10.700 --> 1:39:12.700]  a burst of the bubble, et cetera,
[1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:14.700]  to demean Trump prior to the election,
[1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:16.700]  because the economy is the strongest point
[1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:18.700]  that Trump's got to run on,
[1:39:18.700 --> 1:39:20.700]  and it's very difficult for them to predict.
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:22.700]  And you've been predicting that for the last year,
[1:39:22.700 --> 1:39:24.700]  that if they failed with impeachment coming up,
[1:39:24.700 --> 1:39:26.700]  that they would do that, and so now here we are.
[1:39:26.700 --> 1:39:29.700]  Yes, but I don't, in December,
[1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:32.700]  when we had this big bank reserve problem,
[1:39:32.700 --> 1:39:34.700]  where they weren't going to meet their minimum reserves
[1:39:34.700 --> 1:39:36.700]  at the end of the year and be subject to millions
[1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:38.700]  of dollars of penalties, the Fed came in
[1:39:38.700 --> 1:39:40.700]  and bailed them out with half a trillion dollars,
[1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:43.700]  direct bailout to the banks.
[1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:46.700]  As big as TARP was essentially supposed to be,
[1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:48.700]  you know, the 800 billion, but they did it.
[1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:50.700]  And what that told me, and that's why I revised
[1:39:50.700 --> 1:39:53.700]  my prediction to say, I think the bubble is so big
[1:39:53.700 --> 1:39:56.700]  and so dangerous, they don't dare pull the plug
[1:39:56.700 --> 1:40:00.700]  on the economy, even at the expense of, you know,
[1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:03.700]  not being able to hit Trump on the economy
[1:40:03.700 --> 1:40:05.700]  because of the danger of the bubble bursting.
[1:40:05.700 --> 1:40:08.700]  No, I agree, and Trump's gone along with the bubble,
[1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:10.700]  and I'm not for bubbles, but once you're in one this big,
[1:40:10.700 --> 1:40:13.700]  there's no exit strategy now, is there?
[1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:15.700]  I mean, this is just going to, this is insane.
[1:40:15.700 --> 1:40:19.700]  They've got to continue to keep this bubble inflated,
[1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:21.700]  and the Fed has incredible power to do that.
[1:40:21.700 --> 1:40:23.700]  If you remember, the TARP bailout was supposed
[1:40:23.700 --> 1:40:26.700]  to be 800 billion dollars, or billion dollars.
[1:40:26.700 --> 1:40:29.700]  In fact, we know now that it was 16 trillion dollars.
[1:40:29.700 --> 1:40:30.700]  That's right.
[1:40:30.700 --> 1:40:33.700]  Now, when you float 16 trillion dollars in the market,
[1:40:33.700 --> 1:40:35.700]  and when you're talking about 100 billion dollars a day
[1:40:35.700 --> 1:40:38.700]  in the repro market that the Fed is helping to fund,
[1:40:38.700 --> 1:40:41.700]  and it's not having a major effect in inflation,
[1:40:41.700 --> 1:40:44.700]  that tells us that the actual dollar market,
[1:40:44.700 --> 1:40:46.700]  the pool of dollars is much, much bigger
[1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:48.700]  than we have ever imagined.
[1:40:48.700 --> 1:40:50.700]  The proof of that is when you float 16 trillion dollars,
[1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:52.700]  and it doesn't have an effect on inflation,
[1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:55.700]  internationally, otherwise it means that the pool is much bigger.
[1:40:55.700 --> 1:40:58.700]  How were they able to escape the Zimbabwe model,
[1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:02.700]  just global coordination, or?
[1:41:02.700 --> 1:41:05.700]  No, it's because of the size of the pool.
[1:41:05.700 --> 1:41:08.700]  In other words, ever since the Bretton Woods Agreement,
[1:41:08.700 --> 1:41:10.700]  that was part of the purpose of backing them with gold,
[1:41:10.700 --> 1:41:13.700]  was to get the rest of the world to accept dollars
[1:41:13.700 --> 1:41:15.700]  and reserve because it was a reserve currency.
[1:41:15.700 --> 1:41:17.700]  And we know the CIA then flooded the world
[1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:20.700]  with counterfeit dollars, I guess, to make it the reserve,
[1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:22.700]  to make sure it was everywhere.
[1:41:22.700 --> 1:41:24.700]  That's right, and they've been doing that for years.
[1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:26.700]  It's like the palette fulls of hundred dollar bills
[1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:32.700]  that went to Iraq, the palette fulls that went to Russia,
[1:41:32.700 --> 1:41:34.700]  for example, the fall of the Soviet Union,
[1:41:34.700 --> 1:41:36.700]  and those things flooded Europe.
[1:41:36.700 --> 1:41:39.700]  There were 50 billion dollars that came out of the mattresses
[1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:41.700]  in Argentina when the banking system
[1:41:41.700 --> 1:41:43.700]  shut down in the year 2000.
[1:41:43.700 --> 1:41:48.700]  50 billion, and every country, people are stockpiling dollars,
[1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:51.700]  and that's why the Fed has almost unlimited ability
[1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:55.700]  to float new money without it showing up as inflation.
[1:41:55.700 --> 1:41:58.700]  Because Zimbabwe, you have a tiny country.
[1:41:58.700 --> 1:42:01.700]  That's why people go, oh, the dollar's about to go down
[1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:02.700]  and all this, no.
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:04.700]  If you went about sinisterly making sure
[1:42:04.700 --> 1:42:06.700]  the global fiat systems under your control,
[1:42:06.700 --> 1:42:08.700]  these master planners have done it.
[1:42:08.700 --> 1:42:10.700]  It seems like Trump knows that in a way he's hijacked it,
[1:42:10.700 --> 1:42:13.700]  or is he not in control of the Fed now?
[1:42:13.700 --> 1:42:15.700]  No, he's not in control of the Fed.
[1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:18.700]  They're very, very independent for him.
[1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:20.700]  He doesn't understand a lot about economics,
[1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:23.700]  and neither does Kudlow, his economic advisor.
[1:42:23.700 --> 1:42:27.700]  Everybody who I've talked about and read about
[1:42:27.700 --> 1:42:30.700]  in economic matters takes the official government statistics
[1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:33.700]  to tell whether or not inflation is high or low.
[1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:36.700]  By the way, Joe Scalzen's uncle was like a high-level FBI guy.
[1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:38.700]  I ran a whole major division,
[1:42:38.700 --> 1:42:41.700]  and he was the guy that pioneered almost 65 years ago.
[1:42:41.700 --> 1:42:44.700]  The whole blueprint we had to even begin the fight against it.
[1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:46.700]  So when he's telling you about the economy
[1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:48.700]  and the shadow government, his family's been
[1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:50.700]  right at the heart of that from the beginning.
[1:42:50.700 --> 1:42:51.700]  So he knows what he's talking about.
[1:42:51.700 --> 1:42:53.700]  We're not just saying we have the answers.
[1:42:53.700 --> 1:42:55.700]  We do have the answers.
[1:42:55.700 --> 1:42:58.700]  Keith Bansomer powers the great line of high-quality
[1:42:58.700 --> 1:43:00.700]  storeable food we have available at readyhour.info
[1:43:00.700 --> 1:43:01.700]  or store.com.
[1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:03.700]  And yes, we're selling storeable food here.
[1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:05.700]  What concerns me is we're a month into this,
[1:43:05.700 --> 1:43:07.700]  and food sales aren't going down.
[1:43:07.700 --> 1:43:08.700]  They're going up.
[1:43:08.700 --> 1:43:09.700]  You've never seen anything like this.
[1:43:09.700 --> 1:43:12.700]  Never, never like this, and sustained.
[1:43:12.700 --> 1:43:15.700]  It started 27 days ago, and it kind of went hyper.
[1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:17.700]  And it doesn't fall off.
[1:43:17.700 --> 1:43:20.700]  And in even recent days, it's further increasing.
[1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:21.700]  The semis are rolling.
[1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:22.700]  The chips are in.
[1:43:22.700 --> 1:43:25.700]  We're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[1:43:25.700 --> 1:43:27.700]  Orders that are getting in today, they're going to ship.
[1:43:27.700 --> 1:43:29.700]  They're going to just ship in 10 to 14 days.
[1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:31.700]  We're helping people prepare.
[1:43:31.700 --> 1:43:33.700]  It's just something you cover.
[1:43:33.700 --> 1:43:34.700]  Absolutely.
[1:43:34.700 --> 1:43:36.700]  You like to eat daily, and so we're just backing that up.
[1:43:36.700 --> 1:43:37.700]  It's the best insurance out there.
[1:43:37.700 --> 1:43:40.700]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now
[1:43:40.700 --> 1:43:41.700]  at today's prices.
[1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:45.700]  It's normal to sit on top storeable food and guns.
[1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:46.700]  All our forebears did it.
[1:43:46.700 --> 1:43:47.700]  We've got food.
[1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:48.700]  We've got guns.
[1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:49.700]  We've got Jesus.
[1:43:49.700 --> 1:43:50.700]  We know how to use it.
[1:43:50.700 --> 1:43:51.700]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:52.700]  It's real simple.
[1:43:52.700 --> 1:43:55.700]  NOAA prepared.
[1:43:55.700 --> 1:43:58.700]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[1:43:58.700 --> 1:44:01.700]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams,
[1:44:01.700 --> 1:44:05.700]  their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[1:44:05.700 --> 1:44:07.700]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[1:44:07.700 --> 1:44:12.700]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third-world countries
[1:44:12.700 --> 1:44:17.700]  and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in
[1:44:17.700 --> 1:44:20.700]  and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services
[1:44:20.700 --> 1:44:22.700]  in a giant clowered and pivot program.
[1:44:22.700 --> 1:44:27.700]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate
[1:44:27.700 --> 1:44:30.700]  to world government inner coronavirus.
[1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:35.700]  This is a critical year, and it's a critical time to stay informed
[1:44:35.700 --> 1:44:39.700]  and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[1:44:39.700 --> 1:44:42.700]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck,
[1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:47.700]  so spread the word about band.video and infowars.com.
[1:44:47.700 --> 1:44:49.700]  That is so important.
[1:44:49.700 --> 1:44:52.700]  You are at the center of the resistance.
[1:44:52.700 --> 1:44:54.700]  You are our only hope.
[1:44:57.700 --> 1:44:58.700]  All right, folks.
[1:44:58.700 --> 1:44:59.700]  Here's the bad news.
[1:44:59.700 --> 1:45:01.700]  We've already sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle
[1:45:01.700 --> 1:45:05.700]  with the patented nanotech silver that's documented to knock out viruses
[1:45:05.700 --> 1:45:07.700]  and bacteria unlike anything else.
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:11.700]  But we do still have it in the three-ounce and the one-ounce for limited time.
[1:45:11.700 --> 1:45:17.700]  The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste,
[1:45:17.700 --> 1:45:20.700]  both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:24.700]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial
[1:45:24.700 --> 1:45:26.700]  and high-quality iodine.
[1:45:26.700 --> 1:45:28.700]  And then, of course, the whitening has the nano silver,
[1:45:28.700 --> 1:45:31.700]  but on top of that, it has the above-secral calcium
[1:45:31.700 --> 1:45:33.700]  that remelanorizes the teeth,
[1:45:33.700 --> 1:45:35.700]  and so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[1:45:35.700 --> 1:45:36.700]  Period.
[1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:39.700]  It has the nano silver, and we still have supplies of it,
[1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:41.700]  though it'll sell out at current rates in about two weeks.
[1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:45.700]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off
[1:45:45.700 --> 1:45:48.700]  so everybody can protect themselves with this high-quality product.
[1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:50.700]  You've never used it before. Get yours today.

[1:46:54.700 --> 1:46:57.700]  Bye, you.
[1:47:24.700 --> 1:47:26.700]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[1:47:26.700 --> 1:47:30.700]  Open the phones up and Nick Fuentes is being banned off the Internet.
[1:47:30.700 --> 1:47:32.700]  He's also going to be popping in.
[1:47:32.700 --> 1:47:35.700]  He's running his own counter event, the CPAC, where he's been restricted.
[1:47:35.700 --> 1:47:40.700]  I'm going to be at CPAC tomorrow through Friday through Saturday
[1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:45.700]  to point out the attacks on free speech and Trump's biggest failing.
[1:47:45.700 --> 1:47:47.700]  I'm going to put on an event.
[1:47:47.700 --> 1:47:49.700]  I'm the main speaker at an event.
[1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:54.700]  National Files putting on an event at the Omni that holds 1,000 people.
[1:47:54.700 --> 1:47:55.700]  It can be free.
[1:47:55.700 --> 1:48:00.700]  We have to RSVP at nationalfile.com to point out that the First Amendment is in crisis
[1:48:00.700 --> 1:48:03.700]  and it's an emergency free speech summit.
[1:48:03.700 --> 1:48:07.700]  But I'm going to also be there talking about the situation with the coronavirus
[1:48:07.700 --> 1:48:12.700]  and we have Mike Adams and Alan Key co-hosting throughout the next four days,
[1:48:12.700 --> 1:48:14.700]  but I'll also be on the show.
[1:48:14.700 --> 1:48:16.700]  We're going to be hosting.
[1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:20.700]  A lot of the time from the war room also in the afternoon and doing special reports.
[1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:23.700]  You'll find it banned on video and in fours.com.
[1:48:23.700 --> 1:48:25.700]  It's only you that have put us in the field.
[1:48:25.700 --> 1:48:29.700]  Now listen, everybody knows I've been selling swirable food for 25 years.
[1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:31.700]  I believe in it.
[1:48:31.700 --> 1:48:34.700]  But it's just like I got a gun safe 15 feet away from me.
[1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:35.700]  Okay.
[1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:38.700]  And I like shooting 50 caliber Barrett's.
[1:48:38.700 --> 1:48:40.700]  I don't have those in case you know,
[1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:42.700]  communist have an armored vehicle and come down the road.
[1:48:42.700 --> 1:48:43.700]  But if they ever did,
[1:48:43.700 --> 1:48:46.700]  we've got an armored vehicle ready, but just having fun folks.
[1:48:46.700 --> 1:48:49.700]  The point is, is that we've got a lot of guns here.
[1:48:49.700 --> 1:48:51.700]  And they're just like I got a bunch of tools,
[1:48:51.700 --> 1:48:54.700]  screwdrivers and air compressors and everything else.
[1:48:54.700 --> 1:48:56.700]  And I've got at my house, you know,
[1:48:56.700 --> 1:48:58.700]  three years of food for my family.
[1:48:58.700 --> 1:49:00.700]  I buy it Christmas for family.
[1:49:00.700 --> 1:49:02.700]  Half year food supplies.
[1:49:02.700 --> 1:49:05.700]  And they're like, wow, we take this camp with us.
[1:49:05.700 --> 1:49:06.700]  It's really great.
[1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:07.700]  Family told me I got some food here.
[1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:10.700]  You bought us 15 years ago and it's still good.
[1:49:10.700 --> 1:49:13.700]  Because even if family won't do the right thing,
[1:49:13.700 --> 1:49:15.700]  I'll do it for them because it's common sense.
[1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:17.700]  The Bible tells us to prepare.
[1:49:17.700 --> 1:49:20.700]  You can go back to the stories of the Bible where they tell the Pharaoh,
[1:49:20.700 --> 1:49:23.700]  you know, you better save an extra seven years of things
[1:49:23.700 --> 1:49:26.700]  because seven years is coming when you're going to have that famine.
[1:49:26.700 --> 1:49:27.700]  It's common sense.
[1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:29.700]  You don't want to be hand to mouth,
[1:49:29.700 --> 1:49:31.700]  like a welfare check, Bernie people.
[1:49:31.700 --> 1:49:33.700]  So infowarstore.com.
[1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:35.700]  My Patriot supply powers infowarstore.com.
[1:49:35.700 --> 1:49:37.700]  It's their store, that area.
[1:49:37.700 --> 1:49:38.700]  So you order from us.
[1:49:38.700 --> 1:49:40.700]  You're ordering from them.
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:41.700]  You get the best prices.
[1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.700]  Go right to the head of the line.
[1:49:43.700 --> 1:49:44.700]  You don't go ahead of the line.
[1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:46.700]  You go right to where you're at the line.
[1:49:46.700 --> 1:49:48.700]  They have the food.
[1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:50.700]  But they're now out to four weeks to guarantee your delivery.
[1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:51.700]  It's really about three weeks or so,
[1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:53.700]  but they want to add a cushion in there.
[1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:55.700]  But it may be five weeks tomorrow.
[1:49:55.700 --> 1:49:57.700]  I mean, that wasn't a gimmick when I was like, hey, it's seven days
[1:49:57.700 --> 1:49:59.700]  and hey, it's 10 days and it's 14 days.
[1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:01.700]  Everybody else is basically sold out.
[1:50:01.700 --> 1:50:02.700]  We're selling old crap.
[1:50:02.700 --> 1:50:03.700]  They're not.
[1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:04.700]  It's fresh. It's good.
[1:50:04.700 --> 1:50:06.700]  But that to me is an indicator of how unprepared people are.
[1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:08.700]  And now the general public is getting scared of the virus.
[1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:10.700]  So some of them are starting to buy.
[1:50:10.700 --> 1:50:13.700]  In fact, I was talking to the owner and the orders we're seeing,
[1:50:13.700 --> 1:50:17.700]  the order they're seeing is all new customers, basically 95%.
[1:50:17.700 --> 1:50:19.700]  So people are finding out nobody else has food.
[1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:23.700]  They're coming to infowarstore.com, which again, I'm not proud.
[1:50:23.700 --> 1:50:24.700]  It's what we do.
[1:50:24.700 --> 1:50:28.700]  We're pre-positioned with the Intel to be ready.
[1:50:28.700 --> 1:50:31.700]  And we try to be as ready as we can.
[1:50:31.700 --> 1:50:34.700]  But for me, I go to that Bernie rally yesterday
[1:50:34.700 --> 1:50:36.700]  and I don't say this for effect.
[1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:38.700]  I don't have a lot of nightmares,
[1:50:38.700 --> 1:50:42.700]  but I went to that Bernie rally last night with 20,000, 30,000 people at it.
[1:50:42.700 --> 1:50:48.700]  And they all look like they'd escaped from a mental institution.
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:50.700]  They all had green teeth.
[1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:53.700]  They all had a lot of them had piss running down their legs.
[1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:55.700]  And they were almost all white and Hispanic.
[1:50:55.700 --> 1:50:59.700]  And I'm just saying an ethnic thing here was very, very frightening.
[1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:01.700]  Lots of footage of my ball spot for it.
[1:51:01.700 --> 1:51:02.700]  I thought I care, but my God.
[1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:05.700]  And we stayed outside the perimeter.
[1:51:05.700 --> 1:51:07.700]  As the police said, they still came and attacked us
[1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:11.700]  and bloodied one of our security people and the police did nothing.
[1:51:11.700 --> 1:51:14.700]  And it's just, you know, that woman attacked me right there.
[1:51:14.700 --> 1:51:15.700]  For no reason.
[1:51:15.700 --> 1:51:18.700]  It's over and elbowed me in the side and laughed about it.
[1:51:18.700 --> 1:51:21.700]  So you have society breaks down from an economic collapse
[1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:24.700]  whenever it comes or an asteroid or a war.
[1:51:24.700 --> 1:51:28.700]  We're not the moral people we were in the 1920s comparatively.
[1:51:28.700 --> 1:51:31.700]  And the models I've looked at show the complete breakdown
[1:51:31.700 --> 1:51:32.700]  of civilization.
[1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:34.700]  That's something Joel Scousen is a real expert on.
[1:51:34.700 --> 1:51:36.700]  I'd like to, if you can do it, I know you're a busy man.
[1:51:36.700 --> 1:51:39.700]  Building secure homes all over the world and consulting people in Europe.
[1:51:39.700 --> 1:51:42.700]  But I'll pay for the gas in the hotel and to get you.
[1:51:42.700 --> 1:51:45.700]  I don't even care about the money, but flying your own private jet.
[1:51:45.700 --> 1:51:48.700]  You know, you pilot yourself famously crash and survive.
[1:51:48.700 --> 1:51:51.700]  Please come here and host for a day without me even.
[1:51:51.700 --> 1:51:54.700]  I mean, I'll be here, but put up graphs and the best strategic reload
[1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.700]  because we need to all start.
[1:51:56.700 --> 1:51:59.700]  I'm, I've been honest with the audience.
[1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:01.700]  My family helped found Texas.
[1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:02.700]  People ask, why do you live in Austin?
[1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:03.700]  Well, my mom's family's from here.
[1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:05.700]  My dad's family's from East Texas.
[1:52:05.700 --> 1:52:06.700]  We've been here.
[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:09.700]  It's turned into the rear end of California as it dumps out.
[1:52:09.700 --> 1:52:11.700]  And I don't mean to be gross, but that's literally what it is.
[1:52:11.700 --> 1:52:13.700]  I need to evacuate here.
[1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:17.700]  And so I've really got to just start the new plan within two to three years
[1:52:17.700 --> 1:52:21.700]  to move myself and whoever wants to go with the crew in an exodus out of here
[1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:23.700]  to dig in for what's coming.
[1:52:23.700 --> 1:52:26.700]  Because I think I see Trump is a speed hump to the globalist,
[1:52:26.700 --> 1:52:30.700]  but the evil, the degradation, the degeneracy, the fallenness of the people.
[1:52:30.700 --> 1:52:32.700]  And I don't say that for some power position.
[1:52:32.700 --> 1:52:36.700]  It makes me feel like a worm that other people are so much weaker than I am.
[1:52:36.700 --> 1:52:40.700]  I just morally, this wave of Satanism, I don't see how it can be defeated
[1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:42.700]  before God comes back.
[1:52:42.700 --> 1:52:44.700]  No, I agree.
[1:52:44.700 --> 1:52:48.700]  It's, this is the biggest threat that we face is the new millennials
[1:52:48.700 --> 1:52:53.700]  are mostly socialists being promoted by our public schools and by the universities.
[1:52:53.700 --> 1:52:59.700]  They're imbued with anti-Trump hysteria and this is going to get very, very bad.
[1:52:59.700 --> 1:53:05.700]  It's very interesting talking about Bernie and his, his lead now after the Nevada caucus
[1:53:05.700 --> 1:53:10.700]  is that the establishment is really pushing hard now to boost Biden in South Carolina
[1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:12.700]  and for Super Tuesday.
[1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:18.700]  They've got to simply keep leveling out Sanders to keep him from getting to a majority position.
[1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:23.700]  And this is their strategy to make sure that there's a brokered convention in July for the Democrats
[1:53:23.700 --> 1:53:25.700]  so that nobody has a majority.
[1:53:25.700 --> 1:53:28.700]  You know, they would still like Hillary Clinton to come in as a white knight,
[1:53:28.700 --> 1:53:31.700]  you know, to save the Democratic Party and unite it.
[1:53:31.700 --> 1:53:35.700]  It may or may not work because, but I'll tell you, if Bernie Sanders wins the nominee,
[1:53:35.700 --> 1:53:37.700]  he's not going to beat Trump.
[1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:39.700]  The even middle class Democrats are not.
[1:53:39.700 --> 1:53:44.700]  No, I agree, but his followers then say they're going to burn America.
[1:53:44.700 --> 1:53:46.700]  Well, you know,
[1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:49.700]  I don't know how to strike a book of matches. Thank God.
[1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:54.700]  Yeah, I don't believe in the social or the Civil War scenario that's being touted about.
[1:53:54.700 --> 1:54:01.700]  The establishment's way more in control and, you know, it would be very difficult to run that.
[1:54:01.700 --> 1:54:03.700]  But it's a very important what you were saying about stored food.
[1:54:03.700 --> 1:54:09.700]  The reason why these food companies are short now is because during the Trump administration,
[1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:13.700]  I mean, this emergency essentials went out of business and had to be re-bought out
[1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:20.700]  and NitroPak, the biggest of the food storage, you know, went down and had to be re-financed, et cetera.
[1:54:20.700 --> 1:54:24.700]  I mean, everybody's supplies were very, very low because nobody's been buying.
[1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:27.700]  And that's why your people are talking about all new customers
[1:54:27.700 --> 1:54:32.700]  because the old survivalist body basically said Trump's going to save us.
[1:54:32.700 --> 1:54:34.700]  And that was a big mistake on their part.
[1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:39.700]  So this is really good for America that they're being concerned about the coronavirus so they get prepared.
[1:54:39.700 --> 1:54:43.700]  People have to be prepared to self-quarantine. They have to be prepared not to go to work.
[1:54:43.700 --> 1:54:46.700]  They've got to have a three-month supply of cash on hand.
[1:54:46.700 --> 1:54:50.700]  They've got to have fuel on hand because you don't want to be going to the store.
[1:54:50.700 --> 1:54:52.700]  You don't want to be having to...
[1:54:52.700 --> 1:54:55.700]  What type of firearm do you like best depending on where you're at?
[1:54:55.700 --> 1:55:00.700]  Like a 12-gauge shotgun and then say something like an M4?
[1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:04.700]  Well, I have all types. I like a shotgun for certain positions.
[1:55:04.700 --> 1:55:08.700]  I mean, it's, you know, in terms of crowd control, that's the best thing.
[1:55:08.700 --> 1:55:13.700]  But I also like long-range rifles as well so that I don't have to let people get close.
[1:55:13.700 --> 1:55:15.700]  What do you like? Remington 700?
[1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:18.700]  Are you running a full semi-auto or what do you got?
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:28.700]  Well, I like the 742 semi-auto by Remington in either a.308 or a, you know, there's a longer range round, etc.
[1:55:28.700 --> 1:55:33.700]  But I also have 5.62 rifles, a variety of those.
[1:55:33.700 --> 1:55:37.700]  I like the 9mm. I like the.40 Smith & Wesson.
[1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:42.700]  I like the MP5 for even up to 100 yards. I can shoot bulls-eye all day with an MP5.
[1:55:42.700 --> 1:55:45.700]  Those things are like a laser beam up to 100 yards. They're so little.
[1:55:45.700 --> 1:55:48.700]  Yes, they are. They're very, very good.
[1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:52.700]  So what I'm saying though is I don't think we're going to get to Civil War,
[1:55:52.700 --> 1:55:57.700]  but I think we're going to have to be prepared for a major economic dislocation because of China.
[1:55:57.700 --> 1:56:04.700]  And if it gets to the United States in large numbers, people are going to have to self-quarantine.
[1:56:04.700 --> 1:56:12.700]  And I mean, don't go to church. You don't let your kids go to school, to public schools, especially where there isn't any control.
[1:56:12.700 --> 1:56:15.700]  Well, that's what I told my wife. She's like, there's even more food now?
[1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:19.700]  It's stacked up in the garage. And I said, yeah, there's a 10% chance this is as bad as they say,
[1:56:19.700 --> 1:56:21.700]  get ready to stay in the house for a month at least.
[1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:26.700]  And she's like, OK, but I mean, it is weird to have those conversations.
[1:56:26.700 --> 1:56:37.700]  Yeah, I was talking to a Singapore doctor and he said that, you know, the only hope on the horizon is that the viruses don't seem to proliferate as well in warmer weather.
[1:56:37.700 --> 1:56:43.700]  And when the humidity rises and he said, that's how the SARS and dying out in the H1N1 died out,
[1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:51.700]  not because of any vaccines or any control mechanisms, but because the weather became hostile to transmission of the virus.
[1:56:51.700 --> 1:56:59.700]  But this coronavirus is as transmissible as the H1N1, which was, though the H1N1 wasn't as deadly as SARS,
[1:56:59.700 --> 1:57:02.700]  it was far more transmissible. And so is this coronavirus.
[1:57:02.700 --> 1:57:09.700]  I don't think this is the full weaponized version, but it's enough to, I think, cause China to have real pause,
[1:57:09.700 --> 1:57:16.700]  because frankly, I have never been convinced that biological weapons can be contained to the country that is attacked.
[1:57:16.700 --> 1:57:21.700]  I think it is. Absolutely. That's why you don't want to use them. That's right.
[1:57:21.700 --> 1:57:28.700]  But countries, including the United States, are still developing bioweapons despite their claim that they have given them up.
[1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:32.700]  This is a lie. Everybody's doing it. Joe Scowles and rollerfirstbrief.com.
[1:57:32.700 --> 1:57:34.700]  Let's do five more minutes with us ahead of our next guest.
[1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:37.700]  I want to ask you whatever you want to talk about for five minutes.
[1:57:37.700 --> 1:57:39.700]  I know you've always got really interesting things to say.
[1:57:39.700 --> 1:57:45.700]  I've got like 10 questions, but I want to see what else you want to get off your chest when we come back.
[1:57:45.700 --> 1:57:50.700]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[1:57:50.700 --> 1:57:55.700]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[1:57:55.700 --> 1:57:59.700]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:08.700]  The revolutionary Olexapure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[1:58:16.700 --> 1:58:19.700]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.

[1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:33.700]  The Breathe and the Ion Cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.

[1:59:08.700 --> 1:59:12.700]  I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.

[1:59:35.700 --> 1:59:39.700]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:59:39.700 --> 1:59:43.700]  That's how we span in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:59:43.700 --> 2:00:08.700]  We're inviting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[2:00:08.700 --> 2:00:15.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:15.700 --> 2:00:17.700]  All right. I got a hundred questions for Joel Scowson.
[2:00:17.700 --> 2:00:20.700]  He'll be back with us again soon, World Affairs Brief Editor.
[2:00:20.700 --> 2:00:25.700]  But in the five minutes we have left, what else is front and center? What's on your radar?
[2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:33.700]  Well, one of the things I'm most concerned about is the direction of our military under these politically correct generals and admirals.
[2:00:33.700 --> 2:00:41.700]  For example, David H. Berger, a new commandant of the Marine Corps, it seems to be obsessed with getting more women into the Marine Corps in combat.
[2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:49.700]  He's obsessed with putting in special education and indoctrination of all Marines to be politically correct.
[2:00:49.700 --> 2:00:55.700]  Does he know that's designed to destroy the human military ahead of the machine?
[2:00:55.700 --> 2:00:58.700]  I think he's a globalist. I think he's a liberal.
[2:00:58.700 --> 2:01:09.700]  Nobody gets promoted to be general admiral unless they go through these commandant staff colleges and the national war colleges where they're indoctrinated incessantly with Georgetown professors who are all globalists.
[2:01:09.700 --> 2:01:17.700]  And you don't get promoted unless you are a globalist. So it doesn't matter if he knows or not, he's in agreement with it and that's what's most bothersome.
[2:01:17.700 --> 2:01:27.700]  But even worse of all, he's promoting the doctrine of more amphibious landings as a way to stop the Russian China from attacking the West.
[2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:40.700]  Can you imagine the stupidity of that? With thousands of miles of coast land, you think that a few brigades of Marines doing amphibious landings on the coast of China or the eastern seaboard of Russia...
[2:01:40.700 --> 2:01:47.700]  Let's explain it. That's like the Poles trying to charge the German military in 1940 and being mowed down when they were on horseback.
[2:01:47.700 --> 2:01:57.700]  I didn't know he was proposing that. Obviously, you cut off supply lines, you use satellites, you use cyber war, you use missiles.
[2:01:57.700 --> 2:02:09.700]  He's saying land, U.S. That is sabotage. Excuse me. You're saying he's a former Marine Corps officer. He is proposing 1940-style amphibious assaults?
[2:02:09.700 --> 2:02:18.700]  That's right. It's incredible and he's talking about downsizing the Marine Corps. We need to downsize in order to be stronger and do more amphibious landings.
[2:02:18.700 --> 2:02:20.700]  I mean, this is just ludicrous.
[2:02:20.700 --> 2:02:26.700]  Again, why does he just say we need horse charges?
[2:02:26.700 --> 2:02:42.700]  Now the military has talked Trump into developing and they've developed a smaller nuclear weapon and they're putting it on top of our missiles in the ballistic missile submarines so that we supposedly...
[2:02:42.700 --> 2:02:48.700]  That's depending on doctrine from ten years ago, that it's not nuclear war if it's small.
[2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:57.700]  That's right and they say that we need to have smaller nuclear weapons to deter Russia from starting a nuclear war so that we don't engage them in a larger...
[2:02:57.700 --> 2:02:59.700]  I mean, this is just ludicrous in the first place.
[2:02:59.700 --> 2:03:10.700]  Which is designed to make them move strategic weapons up but not strategic to move up the smaller tactical nukes. That sounds like a perfect recipe to start a nuclear war.
[2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:20.700]  Well, as Scott Ritter pointed out, a former US Marine Corps officer who was a top weapons inspector for the United Nations, he says, this whole doctrine was not Russian and never has been Russian.
[2:03:20.700 --> 2:03:31.700]  It was manufactured in US think tanks saying that the Russians believe this and he says there's absolutely no evidence that they intend to use smaller tactical new weapons to do limited strikes in America.
[2:03:31.700 --> 2:03:42.700]  That was always the US plan famously with the Davey Crockett had the first tactical nukes in case the Russians tried to come into Germany or Western Europe.
[2:03:42.700 --> 2:03:51.700]  We had those in there in the 1950s and 1960s. Wait, they're teaching right now that the Russian strategic doctrine is tactical nukes?
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:52.700]  That's correct.
[2:03:52.700 --> 2:03:53.700]  Wow.
[2:03:53.700 --> 2:04:01.700]  And this is misinformation to deter the public from believing in the preemptive strike doctrine that both Russian and China adhere to.
[2:04:01.700 --> 2:04:09.700]  Russia, the Pentagon has just released a report, by the way, that China is going to double its nuclear throw weight in nuclear weapons in the next 10 years.
[2:04:09.700 --> 2:04:11.700]  And this goes along with my predictions.
[2:04:11.700 --> 2:04:15.700]  The end of this decade is when we are most vulnerable for a Russian nuclear strike.
[2:04:15.700 --> 2:04:26.700]  And if they're not doubling their nuclear capacity because they intend to only use bio weapons or only use tactical nukes, they intend to do a preemptive nuclear strike on US military bases.
[2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:34.700]  And as you said, Joel, they're not doing tacticals. They're doing supersonic ICBMs.
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:42.700]  That's right. With maneuvering warheads, they're going for the major first strike doctrine and that's what we need to understand.
[2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:47.700]  And our generals are telling Trump, no, they're going tactical. These men are globalist traders.
[2:04:47.700 --> 2:05:13.700]  That's an unbelievable. Thank you, sir, so much. I had no idea it was that bad. Thank you.
[2:05:18.700 --> 2:05:28.700]  That robots can be given rights. You name it. They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[2:05:28.700 --> 2:05:35.700]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what they are.
[2:05:35.700 --> 2:05:43.700]  This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control. And there are several big articles up on infowars.com that break this down.
[2:05:43.700 --> 2:05:53.700]  The UK teen find at her house arrest for asking trans police officers gender UK mother spare jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1000 pound fine.
[2:06:14.700 --> 2:06:31.700]  All right, I engaged in quite a rant a few days ago when the major Israeli newspapers came out and called Nick Fuentes a white nationalist and was praising the fact that he was being de-platformed off the Internet.
[2:06:31.700 --> 2:06:43.700]  Because Nick Fuentes, I would even call him white nationalist, but it's Israel that has race laws on if you're not Jewish, you can't date a Jewish person.
[2:06:43.700 --> 2:06:49.700]  Now, I'm not even against Israel's existence. I know the world's a sophisticated place. I know China is the most homogeneous place in the world.
[2:06:49.700 --> 2:06:53.700]  I mean, I understand that there's a lot of stuff going on in Israel. They can have the laws they want.
[2:06:53.700 --> 2:07:11.700]  And I agree that culture should survive and enclaves of people should be protected. I think that goes for Zulu tribe in Africa and it goes for Jews and it goes for those for people that aren't even a race but a religion say Catholic or Protestant.
[2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:23.700]  But I saw that in Sausage Barrack Cohen, of course, came out the ADL and said, I'm anti-Semitic learned elders as I am. I don't even believe it. Learned elders as I and all this crap.
[2:07:23.700 --> 2:07:33.700]  Total defamation to shut me down and to say, hey, that guy's Hitler shut him up. Very, very dangerous.
[2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:42.700]  So he's got the grouper move, but he points out that turning point USA used to be anti-Trump and used to be never Trump.
[2:07:42.700 --> 2:07:52.700]  And if you're never Trump or you're like a lot of these guys, you get syndicated already on TV, you get left alone on YouTube and Facebook. In fact, you get boosted.
[2:07:52.700 --> 2:08:01.700]  Like Ben Shapiro. And then Ben Shapiro and all these guys perch up there like the lords of the earth when they never want a free market debate.
[2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:06.700]  In fact, if you go to their events like Nick Pointess does is try to ask polite questions, you get drug out by your heels.
[2:08:06.700 --> 2:08:12.700]  But when they go to universities, people like Ben Shapiro and people oppose them.
[2:08:12.700 --> 2:08:23.700]  Well, they say, you know, that well, they have a right to free speech, but that the whole neocon movement has their right to free speech as well.
[2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:34.700]  So none of this is being done from a logical perspective. And you have the never Trumpers teamed up with the left to try to censor everybody.
[2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:43.700]  So that when the world champion US ice skating team from the 80s says they like President Trump, the left says they will be destroyed and be platformed.
[2:08:43.700 --> 2:08:55.700]  It is a pillage the whole country and the whole system to the ground movement.
[2:08:55.700 --> 2:08:57.700]  It's really incredible that we've gotten to this point.
[2:08:57.700 --> 2:09:03.700]  So I decided when I heard all this last week to go ahead and pull the trigger and go to CPAC.
[2:09:03.700 --> 2:09:09.700]  I've never gone to CPAC, the biggest so-called Republican event every year.
[2:09:09.700 --> 2:09:17.700]  I don't try to be in DC or be in LA or be in New York. I tried to be in Texas where I'm born and build something new.
[2:09:17.700 --> 2:09:28.700]  I don't need to go to CPAC to be anointed and be knighted into Ben Shapiro's, you know, club with the gay will Gurka.
[2:09:28.700 --> 2:09:31.700]  But Gorka, excuse me.
[2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:40.700]  But when I heard that National follow is going to have some big events and we're sponsoring part of it and when I heard that other folks were going, I said, you know, I'm going to go because they don't want me there.
[2:09:40.700 --> 2:09:43.700]  I'm going to be there. And of course, I'm not making a big issue about it. I don't care.
[2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:51.700]  CPAC said, well, you can have a ticket, but you're not media. You're not going to be on media row. You could be there.
[2:09:51.700 --> 2:09:54.700]  But, you know, we we decide you don't exist.
[2:09:54.700 --> 2:09:57.700]  They're the people that fought Trump. We got Trump elected.
[2:09:57.700 --> 2:10:05.700]  So I'm going just because they don't want me there. And then I'll have the big hotel down the street, giving a big speech at the army where they used to have CPAC.
[2:10:05.700 --> 2:10:07.700]  And I'll be doing other events that are open and free to the public.
[2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:12.700]  This RSVP to national file.com. There's a link up on info wars.com.
[2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:16.700]  Come to the emergency First Amendment Summit featuring Alex Jones in Washington, DC on Wednesday.
[2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:22.700]  That's a thousand person ballroom. I want to invite Nick Fuentes because I've told the folks I said, I'll come if you get Nick Fuentes.
[2:10:22.700 --> 2:10:26.700]  Yeah, we're talking to him. So hopefully he'll be coming. I am a sponsor of it. I'm not running it.
[2:10:26.700 --> 2:10:29.700]  I'm going to have them again. It's there. We were in so many others.
[2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:35.700]  So he joins us now for the next few segments to get beyond whether you are a griper or not.
[2:10:35.700 --> 2:10:40.700]  The fact is that Trump has failed to stand up against censorship.
[2:10:40.700 --> 2:10:46.700]  And the Justice Department announced last week they're not going to go after big tech for antitrust activity.
[2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:49.700]  So yeah, I'm glad Hillary Clinton's not in.
[2:10:49.700 --> 2:10:54.700]  But man, and I've got my own thing with our audience. We're fighting hard for America.
[2:10:54.700 --> 2:11:02.700]  But it's becoming a bitch slap in the face like Trump's our pimp that he won't stand up against big tech and the incredible crap they're up to.
[2:11:02.700 --> 2:11:04.700]  Nick Fuentes, thanks for coming on with us.
[2:11:04.700 --> 2:11:06.700]  Thanks for having me.
[2:11:06.700 --> 2:11:11.700]  Well, I can ask a lot of questions, but tell me what you're planning. You've got your own event I hear at CPAC.
[2:11:11.700 --> 2:11:20.700]  That's right. So on Friday, this Friday, we're going to be hosting an event called America First PAC, which is the same as CPAC Political Action Conference.
[2:11:20.700 --> 2:11:32.700]  And it's going to be Michelle Malkin, myself and Scott Rear. And hopefully we're going to have an alternative sort of like you guys are having to CPAC for perhaps people that don't fit in line with the never Trump mainstream conservatism.
[2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:34.700]  That's that CPAC.
[2:11:34.700 --> 2:11:39.700]  Well, a lot of people that don't have shows or who aren't popular, they think getting on the stage is like the magic event.
[2:11:39.700 --> 2:11:44.700]  I know folks that have shows that have big audiences, but they get scared in front of a group of 100 people.
[2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:51.700]  But the way that everybody acts about events and then who speaks at their event and who that affiliates them with.
[2:11:51.700 --> 2:12:01.700]  I want to put on an event sometime that has like every crazy group, every mainline group at it to have a real just, hey, first amendment event.
[2:12:01.700 --> 2:12:09.700]  Right. Yeah, exactly. I think that's honestly one of the biggest ways that they gatekeep now the mainstream conservative establishment.
[2:12:09.700 --> 2:12:15.700]  I saw this during the campus tour that happened with Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro during the Groyper Wars.
[2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:22.700]  During the last fall semester for college students, you saw that somebody like Michelle Malkin was a perfect example.
[2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:26.700]  You know, here was somebody who is one of these legendary America first conservatives.
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:34.700]  She's been in the business for something like 25 years and whether you like or don't like real, but she turns it by any semi and has kicked out of her job.
[2:12:34.700 --> 2:12:40.700]  Exactly. Right. Exactly. Right. For simply refusing to disavow me and the Groypers and other young America first conservatives.
[2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:46.700]  Why fires her and tells her you're not allowed to speak anymore. We will not host to it. Your events anymore.
[2:12:46.700 --> 2:12:55.700]  And so increasingly it's being difficult or it's become difficult. Excuse me. It's become difficult for America first real outside dissonant right wing types to organize anywhere.
[2:12:55.700 --> 2:13:01.700]  We can't book spaces. We can't get organizations to green light us. You'll have mobs of anti fuss show up.
[2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:07.700]  So anybody's wearing yellow stars in America. It's real America first conservatives.
[2:13:07.700 --> 2:13:12.700]  That's exactly right. We're the only ones. We're the only ones where they're allowed to discriminate on social media.
[2:13:12.700 --> 2:13:20.700]  We're the only ones you're allowed to discriminate. We can't book a hotel for a conference. You can't book a space on a college campus for a speech.
[2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:27.700]  If you look at like we represent true grassroots populism and what people want.
[2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:32.700]  The fact is we were selling what folks want and we're real. They can't handle that.
[2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:39.700]  That's exactly it. That's the problem is we're becoming too much of a threat as people that are actually challenging what the establishment wants.
[2:13:39.700 --> 2:13:46.700]  And that's exactly it. You know at the end of the day people do want to hear what we have to say. That's why they have to do censorship.
[2:13:46.700 --> 2:13:54.700]  That's why they have to kill us on the payment processors and everywhere else. They have to do that because if they didn't there would be a real mass movement.
[2:13:54.700 --> 2:14:02.700]  And I think that's happening anyway. I think that's happening in spite of everything they're doing. But there's a real mass movement that's growing in response to what we're saying because it's resonating with people.
[2:14:02.700 --> 2:14:10.700]  And I don't want to talk about the ADL because they'll represent Israel or Jews in general but they do represent the globalist.
[2:14:10.700 --> 2:14:18.700]  They came out and said that Ted Cruz is an anti-Semite because he said Bloomberg's buying the media. He spent 500 million. He is buying the media.
[2:14:18.700 --> 2:14:27.700]  Just as he's Jewish they inject the anti-Semitism into it. They're the ones promoting it in the left just like other leftist groups promote racism.
[2:14:27.700 --> 2:14:33.700]  I'm sick of it. I'm so sick of the ADL because it doesn't hurt me to say I'm Hitler. No one believes that.
[2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:44.700]  But the fact that they're trying to do that and they're so disingenuous with that Rosenblatt guy like Dr. Evil mini me guy is just BS man. I'm tired of it.
[2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:55.700]  Yeah I hear you. I saw that Ted Cruz tweet the other day and you know I don't think it's controversial to say that Michael Bloomberg who owns Bloomberg which is a massive mainstream media conglomerate
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:15:04.700]  or massive mainstream media outlet and who's now buying as you said 500 million dollars of commercials and advertisements to say that he's buying the media.
[2:15:04.700 --> 2:15:05.700]  That's an anti-Semite.
[2:15:05.700 --> 2:15:12.700]  But I mean who does Rosenblatt think he is now Ted Cruz who's a Zionist is anti-Jew?
[2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:17.700]  Yeah it's absolutely and that's how it goes though. Everything's anti-Semitic. Everything's playing into a trope.
[2:15:17.700 --> 2:15:24.700]  If you talk about Soros, if you talk about Bloomberg, if you talk about Bezos, any one of these guys all of a sudden it must be some kind of blank.
[2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:26.700]  Is Bezos even Jewish?
[2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:30.700]  I'm not sure I heard that. I believe he's adopted but there's speculation.
[2:15:30.700 --> 2:15:33.700]  He's adopted by a Spanish guy.
[2:15:33.700 --> 2:15:36.700]  Right. I have her speculation though.
[2:15:36.700 --> 2:15:44.700]  Stay there, Groyper. We have the Groyper Patient One with us. Lord of the Groypers.
[2:15:44.700 --> 2:15:46.700]  Uh-uh, do you want some Groyper?
[2:15:46.700 --> 2:16:13.700]  We'll be right back. I love it. infowars.com, newswars.com and we'll tell you where to find this guy too.
[2:16:16.700 --> 2:16:22.700]  That's survivaliscamp.com. Trust your family survival to survivaliscamp.com.
[2:16:46.700 --> 2:16:58.700]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain. The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[2:16:58.700 --> 2:17:03.700]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[2:17:03.700 --> 2:17:11.700]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[2:17:11.700 --> 2:17:19.700]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[2:17:19.700 --> 2:17:30.700]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[2:17:43.700 --> 2:17:45.700]  800-600-3388.
[2:17:45.700 --> 2:17:52.700]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[2:17:53.700 --> 2:18:00.700]  There can no longer be any doubt. This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[2:18:00.700 --> 2:18:09.700]  It's very communicable. It spreads very, very fast. It is killing a lot of people. And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[2:18:09.700 --> 2:18:16.700]  And the White House is now openly challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist, and so is Senator Cotton.
[2:18:16.700 --> 2:18:20.700]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[2:18:20.700 --> 2:18:27.700]  2020 is not a year to play games with. The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[2:18:27.700 --> 2:18:33.700]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here. That's why listeners in the InfoWars need to be prepared.
[2:18:33.700 --> 2:18:39.700]  InfoWarsStore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier.
[2:18:39.700 --> 2:18:46.700]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak. We have high-quality, storeable foods ready to ship.
[2:18:46.700 --> 2:18:53.700]  And vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock along with Ultra-12 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:18:53.700 --> 2:18:58.700]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long.
[2:18:58.700 --> 2:19:04.700]  But man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him, everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[2:19:04.700 --> 2:19:10.700]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[2:19:10.700 --> 2:19:20.700]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, InfoWars.com.
[2:19:20.700 --> 2:19:27.700]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[2:19:27.700 --> 2:19:33.700]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? Will you go? Well, we're being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[2:19:33.700 --> 2:19:36.700]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[2:19:36.700 --> 2:19:44.700]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[2:19:44.700 --> 2:19:52.700]  You have the loudest sound of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[2:20:14.700 --> 2:20:24.700]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:24.700 --> 2:20:34.700]  All right. Lord of the Gropers. No, that's not a group, if you're, that's Lord of the Gropers is here with us.
[2:20:34.700 --> 2:20:44.700]  Nick Fuentes heavily censured, banned off YouTube a bunch of stuff for thought crime. And really what he's being banned for is being mean to Turning Point USA.
[2:20:44.700 --> 2:20:50.700]  And I want to be clear. I don't have some raging heart on to go after Turning Point USA.
[2:20:50.700 --> 2:20:54.700]  But I saw how they called Candace Owens for saying Hitler was a globalist.
[2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:58.700]  He originally launched the EU globalist plan. He had a global plan.
[2:20:58.700 --> 2:21:06.700]  In fact, they would have, I was watching a documentary the other night on mainline TV about the EU being created by Hitler.
[2:21:06.700 --> 2:21:12.700]  It was Nazi conspiracies. They were showing the documents. It was on some discovery channel.
[2:21:12.700 --> 2:21:16.700]  But she says that, oh, Hitler wasn't a nationalist. Don't say nationalist or Hitler.
[2:21:16.700 --> 2:21:20.700]  Hitler was a globalist. You're for Hitler. You're for Hitler. What the hell?
[2:21:20.700 --> 2:21:26.700]  And Turning Point USA threw her out the door. Let's find she's bigger than ever.
[2:21:26.700 --> 2:21:35.700]  But then everybody's just so scared like, oh, don't call me a name when the left has no power except the power we give them, Nick.
[2:21:35.700 --> 2:21:41.700]  That's exactly it. Yep. And Charlie Kirk and Turning Point and Ben Shapiro, those are the people that are pushing that on the right.
[2:21:41.700 --> 2:21:48.700]  I've been saying it for years that and as you just said, the words only have power in so far as we give them power.
[2:21:48.700 --> 2:21:53.700]  If we are to simply ignore them and say, we're going to put America first, we're going to be nationalists.
[2:21:53.700 --> 2:21:59.700]  In spite of being called a white nationalist, Nazi, whatever, then really the left's game would be up.
[2:21:59.700 --> 2:22:07.700]  But I think that that they use those words. I think it betrays the fact that they are basically complicit in the globalist establishment agenda.
[2:22:07.700 --> 2:22:13.700]  I don't think it's indicative even so much of the left of using those words so much as it is. Are you establishment?
[2:22:13.700 --> 2:22:17.700]  Are you a globalist? They fear populism. They fear the true right wing.
[2:22:17.700 --> 2:22:24.700]  They fear social conservatism, people from the heartland, and they use the same words as a left does as a mainstream media.
[2:22:24.700 --> 2:22:26.700]  I'm talking about Charlie Kirk and Turning Point and Ben Shapiro.
[2:22:26.700 --> 2:22:33.700]  Oh, they use the exact same playbook, and the left is exposed and defeated. The threat is the threat from within.
[2:22:33.700 --> 2:22:39.700]  Exactly, exactly. And then that is why they have to use those words, because they know that if we were allowed to go out and do our thing,
[2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:47.700]  and this were to become the real mainstream conservatism, I think they know on some level that if what Donald Trump ran on in 2016,
[2:22:47.700 --> 2:22:53.700]  which was ending foreign wars, protecting our workers with trade, ending immigration, stopping open borders,
[2:22:53.700 --> 2:23:00.700]  if they were to allow that to become the real right wing in the country, if that were to become mainstream, and the GOP would do that after Donald Trump.
[2:23:00.700 --> 2:23:03.700]  We would see the extinction of the Democratic Party.
[2:23:03.700 --> 2:23:08.700]  That's exactly right. The extinction of the Democratic Party and even the globalist element in the Republican Party.
[2:23:08.700 --> 2:23:10.700]  That would be, like, huge for the country.
[2:23:10.700 --> 2:23:14.700]  That's right. They're all battling for their lives, and the Republican Party can split into two different populist arms,
[2:23:14.700 --> 2:23:17.700]  a libertarian and a Republican, or how do you see that happening?
[2:23:17.700 --> 2:23:24.700]  Or, like, maybe a right-wing Christian versus just a mainline conservative? Because you need two parties. How would that split?
[2:23:24.700 --> 2:23:27.700]  Well, I think that increasingly you're seeing splits in both parties.
[2:23:27.700 --> 2:23:31.700]  I think you're seeing on the left there's a divide now between the progressives and the more establishment-
[2:23:31.700 --> 2:23:35.700]  So the left just calls themselves, as you have a Communist Party versus America.
[2:23:35.700 --> 2:23:38.700]  Right. Yeah, that's essentially it. That's essentially it.
[2:23:38.700 --> 2:23:45.700]  It's this globalist element of people that are in favor of open borders and free trade and, you know, some kind of socialized program.
[2:23:45.700 --> 2:23:50.700]  But you're going off what the demographics are, and I'm not poo-pooing that. I think you're right.
[2:23:50.700 --> 2:23:54.700]  But I want to change the whole paradigm, defeat them completely.
[2:23:54.700 --> 2:23:57.700]  The Democrats are all involved in crime, election fraud. They can all be removed.
[2:23:57.700 --> 2:24:00.700]  Without their command and control, their little commie followers go away.
[2:24:00.700 --> 2:24:06.700]  I'm saying if we got real supremacy of Americana, how do you then split that into a two-party system?
[2:24:06.700 --> 2:24:12.700]  Well, it would be difficult to say. You know, people have said that it could line up with something like a workers' party,
[2:24:12.700 --> 2:24:16.700]  like you could have the working and middle class of all the different groups of people.
[2:24:16.700 --> 2:24:19.700]  Exactly, against those that are more assigned to the corporatists.
[2:24:19.700 --> 2:24:24.700]  Right, right, against the elites. And it's difficult to say exactly how it might line up.
[2:24:24.700 --> 2:24:32.700]  So a populist conservative Americana party against those that are more mainline Republican, globalist, or...
[2:24:32.700 --> 2:24:38.700]  Sure, sure. Yeah, I think people that are embodying or inhabiting maybe what Trump represented in 2016,
[2:24:38.700 --> 2:24:41.700]  I'm hoping that that will remain as a faction in the GOP.
[2:24:41.700 --> 2:24:48.700]  You see a lot of senators and congressmen that are much closer to Trump than they are to Mitch McConnell or Mitt Romney or John McCain.
[2:24:48.700 --> 2:24:54.700]  And I think that will be a divide. That'll be a fault line that we'll see probably if Trump leaves office in 2024,
[2:24:54.700 --> 2:24:59.700]  which I'm assuming he'll win in 2020, I think you'll really see that rift grow in the next four years
[2:24:59.700 --> 2:25:04.700]  between people like Nikki Haley and the Neocons and the globalists on one side
[2:25:04.700 --> 2:25:09.700]  and the real right-wing America-first, MAGA-type people that Trump has inspired on the other side.
[2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:14.700]  Well, Nick, I want to invite you and Michelle Monk and I'm going to fly out Friday night so I won't come to your event.
[2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:19.700]  I didn't invite you, but that's fine. I get ice cream in the ultimate Michelle Mountain eleven years ago.
[2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:23.700]  I wanted to forgive me. I probably was out of control when her security guy punched me in the arm.
[2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:26.700]  I hit him back or hit me with his elbow, but I like Michelle. Tell her I said hi,
[2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:31.700]  but I want to invite you because I know an actual fall wants to invite you to our event Wednesday.
[2:25:31.700 --> 2:25:35.700]  You want to come to that at the Army? Absolutely. I would love to go.
[2:25:35.700 --> 2:25:40.700]  They haven't reached out to you? I don't think they have reached out to me yet.
[2:25:40.700 --> 2:25:44.700]  They were asking me like a week ago and I love the guys over there and I even said,
[2:25:44.700 --> 2:25:47.700]  hey, let me sponsor. They were getting a smaller event and I said, hell, for like 20 grand more,
[2:25:47.700 --> 2:25:50.700]  you can get a bigger one. So I'm sponsoring it, but I'm not telling them who to have there.
[2:25:50.700 --> 2:25:53.700]  I said, I want Nick Fuentes and I said, I know they're having an event.
[2:25:53.700 --> 2:25:56.700]  You want to get Michelle Malcolm because I want to, like, people love people coming back.
[2:25:56.700 --> 2:25:59.700]  I like to get up there with her and tell her, I'm sorry. I was mean to you.
[2:25:59.700 --> 2:26:02.700]  You know, she was full of crap saying the Marines didn't throw a puppy off a clip.
[2:26:02.700 --> 2:26:05.700]  They did. It was a real puppy. She said, I lied. It was a robot. Whatever.
[2:26:05.700 --> 2:26:10.700]  It was over the top and almost beat up her security guys. I mean, I'm going to take one of them hit me
[2:26:10.700 --> 2:26:14.700]  and I knocked him, you know, knocked him the next week, but I just want to be friends with her
[2:26:14.700 --> 2:26:16.700]  and it's all stupid. Does that make sense?
[2:26:16.700 --> 2:26:21.700]  Makes sense to me. Yeah, I think we should, you know, put aside maybe past grudges or things like that
[2:26:21.700 --> 2:26:24.700]  because I think we're all on the same page fighting the globalists.
[2:26:24.700 --> 2:26:27.700]  So, but yeah, it sounds like an awesome event. I'd love to come.
[2:26:27.700 --> 2:26:32.700]  I think we're really seeing the consolidation of all the right forces coming together in the past year
[2:26:32.700 --> 2:26:37.700]  and maybe we'll all be gearing up for the election together. So I like the sound of that a lot.
[2:26:37.700 --> 2:26:39.700]  Well, I like the political incorrectness too.
[2:26:39.700 --> 2:26:41.700]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:26:41.700 --> 2:26:43.700]  And you haven't done the things they say you've done, neither have I.
[2:26:43.700 --> 2:26:46.700]  And I'm just, that's why they said, hey, we can speak this venue.
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:50.700]  And I said that venue holds 300 people. I said, get the bigger, bigger venue.
[2:26:50.700 --> 2:26:53.700]  They were going to get the Trump Hotel and that and then that got sold before that.
[2:26:53.700 --> 2:26:57.700]  I said, so again, it's not my event, but I am paying for part of it because I just want to have
[2:26:57.700 --> 2:27:01.700]  where CPAC used to meet in a big ballroom and hey, I'm paying for the drinks.
[2:27:01.700 --> 2:27:05.700]  The lizards are paying them. You have a round of drinks. Everybody's there and some food just because
[2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:09.700]  I want to say, hey, we're important. We love freedom. We love justice.
[2:27:09.700 --> 2:27:11.700]  And we're not just, you know, obsessed with CPAC.
[2:27:11.700 --> 2:27:14.700]  Are you going to go to CPAC or are you banned from that?
[2:27:14.700 --> 2:27:18.700]  I'm actually banned from CPAC officially. I was banned last year.
[2:27:18.700 --> 2:27:21.700]  I tried to get a ticket and I was not able to do that.
[2:27:21.700 --> 2:27:25.700]  I got kicked out actually last year. They tried to kick me out. I ran away.
[2:27:25.700 --> 2:27:28.700]  But this year, I believe I'm on the same blacklist.
[2:27:28.700 --> 2:27:32.700]  The usual suspects are responsible for that, but I'll be there.
[2:27:32.700 --> 2:27:35.700]  I'm going to try to infiltrate and I'll definitely be floating around.
[2:27:35.700 --> 2:27:39.700]  I'm not going to CPAC to try to confront anybody.
[2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:42.700]  I'm going to get mobbed and do a bunch of interviews and have a great time.
[2:27:42.700 --> 2:27:46.700]  I don't need CPAC. You know, we brought Trump in CPAC just, you know,
[2:27:46.700 --> 2:27:49.700]  and the never Trump was climbed on its back after we gave birth to it.
[2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:54.700]  But I told them, I said, I'm coming. I'm going to be nice.
[2:27:54.700 --> 2:27:57.700]  If you want to make it a big issue, we are ready to take it over.
[2:27:57.700 --> 2:28:01.700]  But if they just leave me alone, then it's going to be fine because I don't need CPAC.
[2:28:01.700 --> 2:28:05.700]  But yeah, I guess they were concerned you might talk to Ben Shapiro,
[2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:10.700]  who just be so royal he just can't have a little plebe talk to him or what happened.
[2:28:10.700 --> 2:28:15.700]  Yeah, yeah, I try to confront him at the Turning Point SAS conference back in December.
[2:28:15.700 --> 2:28:21.700]  I guess they don't want me to come to CPAC and be in a position where I might have to talk to Charlie Kirk or Ben Shapiro.
[2:28:21.700 --> 2:28:23.700]  You understand that these people can attack us.
[2:28:23.700 --> 2:28:28.700]  They can snipe at us on Twitter and they can defame us and call us all kinds of nasty names.
[2:28:28.700 --> 2:28:30.700]  But we are not entitled to respond.
[2:28:30.700 --> 2:28:32.700]  They are the elites. They are the establishment.
[2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:34.700]  And, you know, that is our role.
[2:28:34.700 --> 2:28:36.700]  Charlie Shapiro does attack me and they do.
[2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:40.700]  But I mean, I love it because he's so hated by most people. That's a positive.
[2:28:40.700 --> 2:28:43.700]  So if I see Shapiro like, hey, Shapiro, do an interview, he'll probably run away.
[2:28:43.700 --> 2:28:46.700]  I'm not going to give him the chance to like run and say I attacked him.
[2:28:46.700 --> 2:28:51.700]  So he's like, he's such a delicate little flower that, in fact, I'm not going to even talk to Shapiro.
[2:28:51.700 --> 2:28:52.700]  I see him.
[2:28:52.700 --> 2:28:57.700]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:57.700 --> 2:28:59.700]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:28:59.700 --> 2:29:01.700]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:01.700 --> 2:29:07.700]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:07.700 --> 2:29:12.700]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:12.700 --> 2:29:17.700]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:17.700 --> 2:29:20.700]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[2:29:20.700 --> 2:29:25.700]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:25.700 --> 2:29:27.700]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:27.700 --> 2:29:32.700]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:32.700 --> 2:29:36.700]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[2:29:36.700 --> 2:29:37.700]  Get clean.
[2:29:37.700 --> 2:29:52.700]  Call now and learn more 800-506-6740-800-506-6740. That's 800-506-6740.
[2:30:07.700 --> 2:30:10.700]  You can see you get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[2:30:10.700 --> 2:30:12.700]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[2:30:12.700 --> 2:30:15.700]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[2:30:15.700 --> 2:30:21.700]  We have sold out of a 16-ounce immune gargle that has the nano-silver that's patented and documented and even admitted
[2:30:21.700 --> 2:30:24.700]  and documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona SARS family.
[2:30:24.700 --> 2:30:25.700]  A virus.
[2:30:25.700 --> 2:30:27.700]  We're almost sold out of the 1-ounce spray bottles.
[2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:32.700]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're in about a week and a half or so of the super silver 3-ounce bottles.
[2:30:32.700 --> 2:30:33.700]  Great to have, period.
[2:30:33.700 --> 2:30:34.700]  Really good for your gums.
[2:30:34.700 --> 2:30:35.700]  Really great for your teeth.
[2:30:35.700 --> 2:30:37.700]  We also have the super silver and our whitening toothpaste.
[2:30:37.700 --> 2:30:42.700]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company base here in the U.S.
[2:30:42.700 --> 2:30:46.700]  that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[2:30:46.700 --> 2:30:47.700]  There's a lot of patriots.
[2:30:47.700 --> 2:30:49.700]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[2:30:49.700 --> 2:30:52.700]  There's the flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[2:30:52.700 --> 2:30:53.700]  It's very exciting.
[2:30:54.700 --> 2:30:56.700]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[2:30:56.700 --> 2:31:03.700]  Ultra-12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[2:31:03.700 --> 2:31:11.700]  Vitamin mineral fusion is high-quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family,
[2:31:11.700 --> 2:31:14.700]  especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[2:31:14.700 --> 2:31:20.700]  Ultra-12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken subliqually under the tongue.
[2:31:20.700 --> 2:31:21.700]  It is back in stock.
[2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:30.700]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.

[2:32:17.700 --> 2:32:24.700]  Vitamin E and the incredible silver salt formula, infowar's silver cream works triple duty,

[2:33:16.700 --> 2:33:22.700]  Well, there can no longer be any doubt. The coronavirus is man-made, we're all vindicated, they're admitting that now.
[2:33:22.700 --> 2:33:26.700]  It's spreading all over the world and it's got a high kill rate.
[2:33:26.700 --> 2:33:31.700]  It's man-made, it's spreading all over the world, it's got a high kill rate. Wow.
[2:33:31.700 --> 2:33:35.700]  Yeah, we're selling a lot of storable food right now, but not the way I want to sell it.
[2:33:35.700 --> 2:33:40.700]  Governments have bought up almost all the other storable foods from other distributors, we still have it.
[2:33:40.700 --> 2:33:45.700]  We have the biggest distributor in the world, my patriot, they're our partners, they're interfaced with our shopping cart.
[2:33:45.700 --> 2:33:48.700]  You get your order in there, they're the ones taking it, it gets right out to you.
[2:33:48.700 --> 2:33:53.700]  Marshall Law in Northern Italy, store shelves sold out there, they're saying a high death rate.
[2:33:53.700 --> 2:34:01.700]  So it looks like the cover-up is falling apart. If you want to be locked in to get your storable foods, it was seven days, then it was 10 days, then it was 14 days.
[2:34:01.700 --> 2:34:07.700]  This morning, it was three weeks. They called up and said the orders are so off the chart, we've got the storable food,
[2:34:07.700 --> 2:34:15.700]  but we're 24 hours a day at our three factories. It could be four weeks maximum till delivery, it's less than that, but they're putting a little bit of a buffer in there.
[2:34:15.700 --> 2:34:25.700]  You get your orders in now, on your three week, your two month, your four month, your six month, they've got all there at infowarstorb.com.
[2:34:25.700 --> 2:34:39.700]  And then it's insurance that tastes good and is great, and the last 25 years in the big plastic sealed containers packaged inside, you're not going to find food of this quality at a better price anywhere, infowarstorb.com
[2:34:39.700 --> 2:34:49.700]  or call toll-free, triple-eight, two-five-three, three-one-three-nine, and then separately, I'm going to Maryland that it really is the summer of D.C.,
[2:34:49.700 --> 2:34:56.700]  National Harbor, but I'll also be in D.C. because we've printed 2 million of these stickers. Save the First Amendment.
[2:34:56.700 --> 2:34:59.700]  There's 19 other messages, but this is the one we printed the most out.
[2:34:59.700 --> 2:35:09.700]  And everybody that goes to operationwin2020.com and puts in your address gets a free packet of these, 20 of these, can buy them at cost up to 1,000 pieces.
[2:35:09.700 --> 2:35:14.700]  We're going to Trump rallies, we're not taking them over, we're not disrupting. No, it's not how I operate.
[2:35:14.700 --> 2:35:23.700]  I'm going to left this like burning. Silence is powerful. We'll just put it right over our mouths.
[2:35:23.700 --> 2:35:28.700]  Hand out a pack of them, it looks like duct tape, but it doesn't pull out your beard or whatever.
[2:35:28.700 --> 2:35:34.700]  You're a bearded lady, you know, men can have babies now, but you just take it off, put it on, and then have a discussion about it.
[2:35:34.700 --> 2:35:44.700]  It's a great way to do it. And just like Rolling Stone admitted that half the people in the 2016 Trump rallies and ongoing wearing M4 shirts,
[2:35:44.700 --> 2:35:49.700]  that really shook the left up. They went, oh, Trump is Alex Jones, let's get him. That kind of elicited the whole attack.
[2:35:49.700 --> 2:35:56.700]  It's just fine. I love it. But now that you'll have these, we're going to Trump and saying you need to do something now.
[2:35:56.700 --> 2:36:04.700]  And in closing, Nick Fuentes, Nick, now that you've been banned off the internet like I have been, I guess you're still on Twitter for now, at NickJFuentes.
[2:36:04.700 --> 2:36:07.700]  It's always good to promote URLs. Hopefully you've got one of those now.
[2:36:07.700 --> 2:36:11.700]  What do you want to say about Trump, about the reign of terror of the censorship?
[2:36:11.700 --> 2:36:17.700]  Because I see it as his biggest failing and I'm a supporter of Trump, but man, I tell you, I'm not going to lay out and take this.
[2:36:17.700 --> 2:36:24.700]  I completely agree. I think the failure to address tech censorship is hands down the biggest failure of the administration so far.
[2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:32.700]  And especially because I think Donald Trump, maybe more than any other president, relied on the internet and his supporters on the internet,
[2:36:32.700 --> 2:36:38.700]  people like yourself and many other vocal Trump supporters on Twitter or on YouTube or anywhere else to get elected.
[2:36:38.700 --> 2:36:46.700]  And so we saw that since 2016, we all saw the clips from Google and from Facebook and Twitter where they said, we're not going to let this happen again.
[2:36:46.700 --> 2:36:53.700]  We're going to do everything in our power to make sure that we can't allow an outsider, an outsider, an establishment person to get elected president.
[2:36:53.700 --> 2:37:01.700]  We're going to ensure that that doesn't happen by censoring all of his allies, all of his grassroots, popular supporters online.
[2:37:01.700 --> 2:37:05.700]  And that has happened basically unimpeded for the past four years without anything.
[2:37:05.700 --> 2:37:09.700]  I've heard that there's executive orders drafted for this. There's many ways that you could go about this.
[2:37:09.700 --> 2:37:13.700]  There's been legislation proposed in the House and in the Senate.
[2:37:13.700 --> 2:37:18.700]  They talked about maybe antitrust in the Justice Department or even in the Federal Trade Commission.
[2:37:18.700 --> 2:37:27.700]  There's a lot of ways to go about fixing tech censorship and we haven't even initiated any of it, not from the executive, the judicial, the legislative branch.
[2:37:27.700 --> 2:37:29.700]  And Trump doesn't even talk about it anymore.
[2:37:29.700 --> 2:37:35.700]  Last year, I remember Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Milo got banned off of Facebook.
[2:37:35.700 --> 2:37:43.700]  I think this was last May and the president said that something was going to be done about this and he was monitoring the situation infamously.
[2:37:43.700 --> 2:37:45.700]  He said he was monitoring the situation.
[2:37:45.700 --> 2:37:49.700]  And that's really all he's done since 2016. It's just been monitoring.
[2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:57.700]  So I think unless and until he's going to address tech censorship in some capacity, even if he just starts talking about it again, there's a little initiative.
[2:37:57.700 --> 2:38:01.700]  It doesn't have to be a perfect long-term solution right out of the gate.
[2:38:01.700 --> 2:38:09.700]  But as long as there's some initiative and some actual force from the White House on this stuff, I think it's going to be a big problem for him, for his supporters and for him getting reelected.
[2:38:09.700 --> 2:38:11.700]  So it really has been a sad thing.
[2:38:11.700 --> 2:38:15.700]  Well, I mean, Trump thinks he has it sewn up and they're like, sir, don't hurt the economy.
[2:38:15.700 --> 2:38:18.700]  You know, big tech's tied into the NSA, sir.
[2:38:18.700 --> 2:38:20.700]  It's just you can't deal with it. It's too complex.
[2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:22.700]  Well, we're going to come bullhorn the White House.
[2:38:22.700 --> 2:38:25.700]  We're going to come to his events and we're going to say, hey, we love you, Trump.
[2:38:25.700 --> 2:38:31.700]  But stand up against them surveilling us, controlling us, censoring all over Facebook and Twitter.
[2:38:31.700 --> 2:38:32.700]  Photos of his wife get blocked.
[2:38:32.700 --> 2:38:35.700]  If Trump's on Twitter with a race car driver, they block that.
[2:38:35.700 --> 2:38:40.700]  I mean, this is disgusting and un-American and they've lied to Congress about it.
[2:38:40.700 --> 2:38:43.700]  It's now time to take action.
[2:38:43.700 --> 2:38:46.700]  The last closing minute, Nick Pointes, thanks for joining us.
[2:38:46.700 --> 2:38:48.700]  You're going to be covering CPAC.
[2:38:48.700 --> 2:38:50.700]  What else are you doing? You're doing that Friday event.
[2:38:50.700 --> 2:38:51.700]  What else is going on?
[2:38:51.700 --> 2:38:53.700]  Yeah, well, thank you again so much for having me.
[2:38:53.700 --> 2:38:55.700]  Always a pleasure to be on InfoWars with you.
[2:38:55.700 --> 2:39:00.700]  Yes, we're doing AFPAC, which is on Friday and that is in Washington, D.C.
[2:39:00.700 --> 2:39:01.700]  Same week and a CPAC.
[2:39:01.700 --> 2:39:04.700]  And I'm also planning on doing a college tour this spring.
[2:39:04.700 --> 2:39:07.700]  There's some details coming forward soon about that.
[2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:11.700]  And I am launching a new website where you can watch me stream my show,
[2:39:11.700 --> 2:39:13.700]  which will be independent of any platform.
[2:39:13.700 --> 2:39:15.700]  It's going to be totally proprietary.
[2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:17.700]  So be on the lookout for that as well.
[2:39:17.700 --> 2:39:18.700]  That's good.
[2:39:18.700 --> 2:39:22.700]  And you're going to be Wednesday coming to the national follow event at the Omni in D.C.
[2:39:22.700 --> 2:39:23.700]  Absolutely.
[2:39:23.700 --> 2:39:26.700]  Yes, I will make it out there and hopefully I'll see you there.
[2:39:26.700 --> 2:39:27.700]  All right, I'll be there.
[2:39:27.700 --> 2:39:29.700]  Nick Pointes, thank you, sir.
[2:39:29.700 --> 2:39:30.700]  Thanks so much.
[2:39:30.700 --> 2:39:31.700]  Thank you.
[2:39:31.700 --> 2:39:32.700]  Okay.
[2:39:32.700 --> 2:39:35.700]  I've got a bunch of Islamic criminal activity to cover
[2:39:35.700 --> 2:39:40.700]  and some big Harvard professor says 40, 70% of people worldwide
[2:39:40.700 --> 2:39:42.700]  will be affected with coronavirus.
[2:39:42.700 --> 2:39:48.700]  We're going to hit all of that in the next segment, but I got to hit this.
[2:39:48.700 --> 2:39:51.700]  The federal government, state governments, the UN,
[2:39:51.700 --> 2:39:57.700]  major foundations are funding men dressed in demonic clown outfits.
[2:39:57.700 --> 2:40:01.700]  Super scary dudes that would scare you in a parking lot, scare me.
[2:40:01.700 --> 2:40:03.700]  Coming and meeting with your children.
[2:40:03.700 --> 2:40:09.700]  They've got names like, you know, fish pants, kitty litter, flow job.
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:12.700]  Let's put this up on screen if we can.
[2:40:12.700 --> 2:40:15.700]  The color photo even shows the horror more.
[2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:21.700]  MP, that's a member of parliament, invites drag queen called flow job to school
[2:40:21.700 --> 2:40:25.700]  calls complaining parents homophobic.
[2:40:25.700 --> 2:40:28.700]  So we have a goblin like man.
[2:40:28.700 --> 2:40:33.700]  Scarier than hell scarier than the walking phoenix as a joker is going to have
[2:40:33.700 --> 2:40:35.700]  a meeting with your elementary students.
[2:40:35.700 --> 2:40:39.700]  You keep your damn mouth shut when he talks to them about how they can be
[2:40:39.700 --> 2:40:40.700]  another sex.
[2:40:40.700 --> 2:40:42.700]  This is just unbelievable.
[2:40:42.700 --> 2:40:44.700]  And then here's another one.
[2:40:44.700 --> 2:40:51.700]  Up on enforce.com transgender inmate accused of rape in women's prison facility.
[2:40:51.700 --> 2:40:55.700]  This is in the US a transgender inmate who was transferred from a male prison
[2:40:55.700 --> 2:41:00.700]  to a female prison facility is alleged to have raped fellow inmates.
[2:41:00.700 --> 2:41:04.700]  Yes, men are put in prison with women.
[2:41:04.700 --> 2:41:08.700]  Well, if you're a man, you're in a prison for 20 years for armed robbery like this guy.
[2:41:08.700 --> 2:41:12.700]  You just say I'm a woman and now you're in the women's prison.
[2:41:12.700 --> 2:41:16.700]  Andre Patterson as he's known Illinois Department of Corrections.
[2:41:16.700 --> 2:41:23.700]  Now that's what the name Jenna Monroe Monroe was reportedly not welcomed by female
[2:41:23.700 --> 2:41:29.700]  inmates who she was transferred to in Logan women's prison in Lincoln Monroe who the
[2:41:29.700 --> 2:41:31.700]  time.
[2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:34.700]  As described as a turbulent.
[2:41:34.700 --> 2:41:40.700]  Reportedly attempted suicide with a razor required outside medical help before being segregated.
[2:41:40.700 --> 2:41:42.700]  February 10th an anonymous inmate.
[2:41:42.700 --> 2:41:46.700]  Followed Jane Doe lawsuit against several Logan prison employers.
[2:41:46.700 --> 2:41:48.700]  Allegedly.
[2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:56.700]  Punishing her for trying to report sexual assaults by the biological man who is put in the showers,
[2:41:56.700 --> 2:42:01.700]  the bathrooms and jail cells with women and they're saying he's been raping him.
[2:42:01.700 --> 2:42:08.700]  I don't know a multi-time loser armed robber for all sorts of crimes that's got a big old
[2:42:08.700 --> 2:42:12.700]  tallywacker and he's in there with women.
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:16.700]  Remember what the CNN host Chris Cuomo said he said.
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:20.700]  Couple years ago he said in tweets and on TV said.
[2:42:20.700 --> 2:42:24.700]  If you're 11 year old daughter doesn't like seeing a woman's penis in the showers.
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:27.700]  Their parents are bigots.
[2:42:27.700 --> 2:42:32.700]  Talk about 1984 this is what they are raping reality.
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:39.700]  Raping reality and so now men armed robbers are sent to women's prison to have their way
[2:42:39.700 --> 2:42:44.700]  and the prisons reportedly covered up because it's a God it's a transgender.
[2:42:44.700 --> 2:42:49.700]  Hell let him in the bath with let him in the shower with our little girls immediately
[2:42:49.700 --> 2:42:53.700]  not just prisoners and the children over now.
[2:42:53.700 --> 2:42:57.700]  Real stuff man we're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day long
[2:42:57.700 --> 2:43:01.700]  but man I tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over
[2:43:01.700 --> 2:43:06.700]  and everybody I mean I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:10.700]  That said about two months ago I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:16.700]  I lost full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the Democrats
[2:43:16.700 --> 2:43:20.700]  save the Second Amendment defend the First Amendment in full wars dot com
[2:43:20.700 --> 2:43:23.700]  and it looks like duct tape it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth
[2:43:23.700 --> 2:43:27.700]  you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things
[2:43:27.700 --> 2:43:31.700]  people say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well we're being censored
[2:43:31.700 --> 2:43:33.700]  you know Trump won't do anything about it.
[2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:36.700]  And Dr. Bachanik let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet.
[2:43:36.700 --> 2:43:41.700]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence
[2:43:41.700 --> 2:43:46.700]  and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all silence
[2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:50.700]  and you know what's most disturbing to people silence.
[2:43:52.700 --> 2:43:58.700]  Across the western world from high school to college sports to even the Olympics
[2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:04.700]  men biological men are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[2:44:04.700 --> 2:44:07.580]  This is men invading women's spaces
[2:44:07.580 --> 2:44:11.020]  and bullying them and taking their rights away.
[2:44:11.020 --> 2:44:13.740]  All in the name of the liberalism and openness.
[2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:16.260]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles,
[2:44:16.260 --> 2:44:20.100]  just like today UK team find under house arrest
[2:44:20.100 --> 2:44:22.620]  for asking trans police officers gender
[2:44:22.620 --> 2:44:24.180]  and it hurt their feelings.
[2:44:24.180 --> 2:44:28.180]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[2:44:28.180 --> 2:44:31.140]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine
[2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:36.100]  because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[2:44:36.100 --> 2:44:37.780]  That's the thought police.
[2:44:37.780 --> 2:44:40.700]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:42.940]  you get fined and you go to jail.
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:45.740]  This is tyranny, these people are bullies
[2:44:45.740 --> 2:44:47.340]  and it's sick and it's evil
[2:44:47.340 --> 2:44:50.500]  and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[2:44:50.500 --> 2:44:52.180]  Resist it, speak out against it.
[2:44:53.620 --> 2:44:56.180]  Keith Bansomer powers the great line
[2:44:56.180 --> 2:44:58.060]  of high quality, trouble food we have available
[2:44:58.060 --> 2:45:00.100]  at readyhour at infohorsetour.com
[2:45:00.100 --> 2:45:01.940]  and yes, we're selling durable food here.
[2:45:01.940 --> 2:45:04.500]  What concerns me is we're a month into this
[2:45:04.500 --> 2:45:06.500]  and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[2:45:06.500 --> 2:45:08.100]  You've never seen anything like this.
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:10.740]  Never, never like this and sustain.
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:14.060]  It started 27 days ago and it kind of went hyper
[2:45:14.060 --> 2:45:15.860]  and it doesn't fall off.
[2:45:15.860 --> 2:45:19.380]  And in the even recent days, it's further increasing.
[2:45:19.380 --> 2:45:21.300]  The semis are rolling, the chips are in,
[2:45:21.300 --> 2:45:23.860]  we're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[2:45:23.860 --> 2:45:25.420]  Orders that are getting in today,
[2:45:25.420 --> 2:45:26.820]  they're gonna ship, they're gonna just ship
[2:45:26.820 --> 2:45:28.060]  in 10 to 14 days.
[2:45:28.060 --> 2:45:29.780]  We're helping people prepare.
[2:45:29.780 --> 2:45:31.660]  It's just something you cover.
[2:45:31.660 --> 2:45:32.980]  Absolutely, you like to eat daily
[2:45:32.980 --> 2:45:34.620]  and so we're just backing that up.
[2:45:34.620 --> 2:45:36.220]  It's the best insurance out there.
[2:45:36.220 --> 2:45:39.220]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:40.580]  at today's prices.
[2:45:40.580 --> 2:45:44.140]  It's normal to sit on top, storeable food and guns.
[2:45:44.140 --> 2:45:45.340]  All our forebears did it.
[2:45:45.340 --> 2:45:48.260]  We've got food, we've got guns, we've got Jesus,
[2:45:48.260 --> 2:45:49.220]  we know how to use it.
[2:45:49.220 --> 2:45:51.420]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex, it's real simple.
[2:45:51.420 --> 2:45:52.700]  Noah, prepared.
[2:45:52.700 --> 2:45:57.700]  Cobra Commander here, reminding you to not own firearms,
[2:45:57.700 --> 2:46:00.620]  to not take supplements, to not get sunshine,
[2:46:00.620 --> 2:46:03.140]  and to not love Jesus.
[2:46:03.140 --> 2:46:06.060]  And of course, do not get storeable foods
[2:46:06.060 --> 2:46:08.860]  or any other types of colloidal and nano-silver
[2:46:08.860 --> 2:46:11.860]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:46:11.860 --> 2:46:13.740]  Do not do it.
[2:46:13.740 --> 2:46:18.740]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water,
[2:46:18.740 --> 2:46:22.220]  just like the loving kiss of a King Cobra,
[2:46:22.220 --> 2:46:26.420]  pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients
[2:46:26.420 --> 2:46:31.220]  in your body, hug the cobra, love the cobra,
[2:46:31.220 --> 2:46:36.220]  kiss the cobra, but never, never go to infowars.com
[2:46:38.220 --> 2:46:40.740]  or infowarsstore.com.
[2:46:40.740 --> 2:46:43.740]  Do not order those products.
[2:46:43.740 --> 2:46:48.740]  Silence Jones, now!
[2:46:52.740 --> 2:46:53.740]  Ah, s***.
[2:46:56.740 --> 2:46:59.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:09.740 --> 2:47:11.740]  We're trying to find out what happened
[2:47:11.740 --> 2:47:14.740]  to Julian Assan's extradition hearing today.
[2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:16.740]  I was on the phone with the lawyers
[2:47:16.740 --> 2:47:18.740]  and a member of parliament last night,
[2:47:18.740 --> 2:47:20.740]  and I was supposed to call him this morning,
[2:47:20.740 --> 2:47:22.740]  and I forgot with all the virus news.
[2:47:22.740 --> 2:47:24.740]  I mean, that's just too much going on.
[2:47:24.740 --> 2:47:27.740]  That Weinstein convicted on a bunch of counts,
[2:47:27.740 --> 2:47:30.740]  didn't even cover that because the virus is so big.
[2:47:30.740 --> 2:47:32.740]  So I'm looking at hundreds of articles.
[2:47:32.740 --> 2:47:34.740]  You know, I don't just spread these articles out here
[2:47:34.740 --> 2:47:36.740]  to look like, Carl Rove reportedly used to have
[2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:39.740]  like a huge stack of note cards to intimidate people
[2:47:39.740 --> 2:47:41.740]  in debates.
[2:47:41.740 --> 2:47:43.740]  Well, I wouldn't bring those note cards
[2:47:43.740 --> 2:47:45.740]  unless I was going to use them.
[2:47:45.740 --> 2:47:47.740]  I mean, I've looked at all this news, I've covered it,
[2:47:47.740 --> 2:47:50.740]  and it makes my head spin.
[2:47:50.740 --> 2:47:54.740]  But just look at the leftist media covering things up.
[2:47:54.740 --> 2:47:58.740]  Because in Asian societies and Central Asian societies
[2:47:58.740 --> 2:48:00.740]  and Middle Eastern societies,
[2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:03.740]  if a woman is unaccompanied, she's an animal.
[2:48:03.740 --> 2:48:05.740]  I don't agree with that.
[2:48:05.740 --> 2:48:07.740]  But the left defends it and covers up for Islam
[2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:09.740]  and some of these other systems.
[2:48:09.740 --> 2:48:11.740]  Look at this article on infowars.com.
[2:48:11.740 --> 2:48:14.740]  It's from Breitbart.com.
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:16.740]  Boris government.
[2:48:16.740 --> 2:48:17.740]  He's getting worse and worse.
[2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:20.740]  Oh, he did Brexit, but now he's a globalist.
[2:48:20.740 --> 2:48:25.740]  Releasing report on ethnicity of rape gangs,
[2:48:25.740 --> 2:48:28.740]  not public interest,
[2:48:28.740 --> 2:48:30.740]  even though the local police released it,
[2:48:30.740 --> 2:48:34.740]  and it's all Muslim men, almost all from Pakistan.
[2:48:34.740 --> 2:48:37.740]  Kidnapping and raping little girls.
[2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:39.740]  Absolutely incredible.
[2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:40.740]  Here's another one.
[2:48:40.740 --> 2:48:42.740]  We already mentioned this, but it ties together.
[2:48:42.740 --> 2:48:46.740]  Transgender inmate accused of rape in women's facility.
[2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:49.740]  Men, biological men who are armed robbers,
[2:48:49.740 --> 2:48:52.740]  rapists in many cases, this guy, armed robber,
[2:48:52.740 --> 2:48:54.740]  they get put with women and there's reports of rapes
[2:48:54.740 --> 2:48:59.740]  and they go, well, a man can't, a woman can't rape a woman
[2:48:59.740 --> 2:49:03.740]  because it's the definition, it's a legal game.
[2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:05.740]  Here's another one.
[2:49:05.740 --> 2:49:08.740]  Virginia Dems vote to end mandatory reporting
[2:49:08.740 --> 2:49:12.740]  at schools for sexual battery, marijuana, and more.
[2:49:12.740 --> 2:49:14.740]  And basically rape.
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:17.740]  The left's not going to report on rape anymore.
[2:49:17.740 --> 2:49:20.740]  They're just a lawless criminal.
[2:49:20.740 --> 2:49:23.740]  Lawless criminal takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:27.740]  That's all posted to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[2:49:27.740 --> 2:49:29.740]  There's more articles, Bernie's campaign,
[2:49:29.740 --> 2:49:32.740]  funnel millions to companies connected to Bernie's wife.
[2:49:32.740 --> 2:49:35.740]  Bernie's stealing campaign money? No.
[2:49:35.740 --> 2:49:38.740]  Dirty commies? You would trust him.
[2:49:38.740 --> 2:49:41.740]  He loves you.
[2:49:41.740 --> 2:49:46.740]  Here is Bernie Sanders, daughter of Muslim Brotherhood affiliate
[2:49:46.740 --> 2:49:49.740]  appointed as Bernie Virginia campaign coach.
[2:49:49.740 --> 2:49:56.740]  Of course, the anti-Christian, we work with them.
[2:49:56.740 --> 2:49:59.740]  Moving on to other stories.
[2:49:59.740 --> 2:50:03.740]  Harvard professor says 40 to 70% of people worldwide
[2:50:03.740 --> 2:50:05.740]  will be infected with coronavirus.
[2:50:05.740 --> 2:50:10.740]  Harvard epidemiology professor, Mark Lipschick,
[2:50:10.740 --> 2:50:14.740]  says that the coronavirus will not be containable
[2:50:14.740 --> 2:50:18.740]  and that 47% of worldwide will be infected.
[2:50:18.740 --> 2:50:20.740]  The question is, how deadly is it?
[2:50:20.740 --> 2:50:22.740]  And then coming up when we start the next hour,
[2:50:22.740 --> 2:50:24.740]  ahead of Charles Lindsay taking over,
[2:50:24.740 --> 2:50:26.740]  I'll host a couple of segments,
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:29.740]  30 minutes grills Bernie Sanders on communist support
[2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:31.740]  following major victories.
[2:50:31.740 --> 2:50:33.740]  So they want communism, but not yet.
[2:50:33.740 --> 2:50:38.740]  They want people believing in it, but never getting it.
[2:50:38.740 --> 2:50:45.740]  They stare with Anderson Cooper talking about all of this.
[2:50:45.740 --> 2:50:47.740]  So, yeah, is he a populist candidate?
[2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:49.740]  In everything but reality.
[2:50:49.740 --> 2:50:53.740]  ICE subpoenas liberal Oregon cities over dangerous sanctuary laws,
[2:50:53.740 --> 2:50:56.740]  where people that have committed major crimes are left alone.
[2:50:56.740 --> 2:50:59.740]  But that's, again, how the ball bounces.
[2:50:59.740 --> 2:51:04.740]  That's how the whole dirty enchilada operates.
[2:51:04.740 --> 2:51:07.740]  It's how the whole thing works.
[2:51:07.740 --> 2:51:15.740]  Now, I've got more stories here than I could ever cover.
[2:51:15.740 --> 2:51:21.740]  But I'll just say this.
[2:51:21.740 --> 2:51:24.740]  About a year before we got banned off of every major platform,
[2:51:24.740 --> 2:51:29.740]  we had Twitter and Facebook and YouTube all call us
[2:51:29.740 --> 2:51:34.740]  and want us to have meetings off record with members of their teams,
[2:51:34.740 --> 2:51:36.740]  some of them vice president level,
[2:51:36.740 --> 2:51:42.740]  not had some of those meetings before us about advertising and things.
[2:51:42.740 --> 2:51:47.740]  And in those meetings, a couple of which we recorded,
[2:51:47.740 --> 2:51:50.740]  but it was done in a private conversation.
[2:51:50.740 --> 2:51:53.740]  We were talking about wasn't crimes, so we're not going to release it.
[2:51:53.740 --> 2:51:55.740]  I say I'm having a private conversation when it's going to remain private
[2:51:55.740 --> 2:51:59.740]  unless what you're doing is criminal.
[2:51:59.740 --> 2:52:06.740]  They said, we want you to not criticize Islam and talk about the invasion.
[2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:14.740]  We want you to not criticize transgenderism and what's happening in schools.
[2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:19.740]  We want you to not support President Trump.
[2:52:19.740 --> 2:52:23.740]  We're going to come after you.
[2:52:23.740 --> 2:52:29.740]  Well, you learn a lot about people by what they are obsessed with.
[2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:33.740]  They want the most radical form of Islam to run our lives.
[2:52:33.740 --> 2:52:36.740]  It does the most horrible things you can imagine to everybody.
[2:52:36.740 --> 2:52:42.740]  And they want people to be able to sexualize children.
[2:52:42.740 --> 2:52:46.740]  And they don't want us to support President Trump.
[2:52:46.740 --> 2:52:49.740]  That's the litmus test.
[2:52:49.740 --> 2:52:59.740]  And so I've proudly told them to piss up a rope, to go to hell, to go jump in the lake, to go fly a kite.
[2:52:59.740 --> 2:53:03.740]  But then I sit there and I watch Trump, who knows damn well what's going on.
[2:53:03.740 --> 2:53:06.740]  It has battle plans and executive orders written up.
[2:53:06.740 --> 2:53:13.740]  I mean, I had top law firms, three of them write him executive orders and battle plans, different plans.
[2:53:13.740 --> 2:53:19.740]  And I know they got them, they got, when John Kelly found out these were on his desk, he literally had a fit.
[2:53:19.740 --> 2:53:22.740]  That was in the news, like Jones must be destroyed.
[2:53:22.740 --> 2:53:25.740]  And he's banned from the White House because I mean, I had top law firms.
[2:53:25.740 --> 2:53:34.740]  I paid money to have former FCC board members and current ones.
[2:53:34.740 --> 2:53:39.740]  I mean, put together plans for the president.
[2:53:39.740 --> 2:53:43.740]  And they're like, we can't put up with somebody that takes action.
[2:53:43.740 --> 2:53:47.740]  But I don't tell you those stories.
[2:53:47.740 --> 2:53:53.740]  And those pieces of history to try to say, oh, look what I did, I tell you that you have valuable pieces of the puzzle.
[2:53:53.740 --> 2:54:03.740]  Because if this whole globalist thing is scared of a radio TV show at Austin, Texas, and scared of me going, well,
[2:54:03.740 --> 2:54:09.740]  two years ago, I'm sure we've got to get him documents and plans, we've got to get lawyers and top people to explain it to him.
[2:54:09.740 --> 2:54:12.740]  And we know they're violating the law and it's a cartel.
[2:54:12.740 --> 2:54:15.740]  If I just get a plan in the president, he'll act on it.
[2:54:15.740 --> 2:54:20.740]  And sure as the sun came up, he got the plans and talked about them.
[2:54:20.740 --> 2:54:22.740]  And all hell broke loose here, which is fine.
[2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:23.740]  I'm here to take those attacks.
[2:54:23.740 --> 2:54:25.740]  I want to carry out this mission.
[2:54:25.740 --> 2:54:29.740]  I've made the decision to take whatever happens to carry this out.
[2:54:29.740 --> 2:54:32.740]  Doesn't mean I enjoy it though.
[2:54:32.740 --> 2:54:46.740]  And doesn't mean I enjoy watching President Trump once we spent the time and the energy and everything to put it in his hands.
[2:54:46.740 --> 2:54:49.740]  Because no other lawyers had the balls, because they know they'll come after them.
[2:54:49.740 --> 2:54:50.740]  They're all bunch of cowards.
[2:54:50.740 --> 2:55:00.740]  So I paid lawyers, top ones at big law firms, three of them to write this stuff up.
[2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:01.740]  Because we take action here.
[2:55:01.740 --> 2:55:02.740]  We fight.
[2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:03.740]  We fight tyranny.
[2:55:03.740 --> 2:55:04.740]  It's what we do.
[2:55:04.740 --> 2:55:05.740]  We fight.
[2:55:05.740 --> 2:55:07.740]  We fight evil.
[2:55:07.740 --> 2:55:11.740]  Hell, I even wrote up a new appeal of the top lawyer for Roger Stone.
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:18.740]  His other lawyers put in a fake appeal to the wrong court, filed wrong to make sure it failed in my view.
[2:55:18.740 --> 2:55:20.740]  We went and got the transcript wrote for him.
[2:55:20.740 --> 2:55:22.740]  Just doesn't want it.
[2:55:22.740 --> 2:55:24.740]  Still, we fight.
[2:55:24.740 --> 2:55:26.740]  And you keep us in the game.
[2:55:26.740 --> 2:55:32.740]  And that's all I'm asking for from listeners is to keep me in the game, because I know you're fighting.
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:36.740]  I know you care about the truth and you care about justice, but just pulling back from this.
[2:55:36.740 --> 2:55:38.740]  Here's the thing I'm going to get to.
[2:55:38.740 --> 2:55:42.740]  I get caught in like little historical and memory rabbit thrills telling you what's happened.
[2:55:42.740 --> 2:55:43.740]  Because I'm so truthful.
[2:55:43.740 --> 2:55:45.740]  I just kind of go through my memory telling you what's going on.
[2:55:45.740 --> 2:55:47.740]  There's no filter here.
[2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:49.740]  Here's the takeaway.
[2:55:49.740 --> 2:55:52.740]  Here's the big point I want to get to.
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:56:02.740]  If they're so scared of me and are limited resources, they're pretty pathetic and they could be beaten.
[2:56:02.740 --> 2:56:04.740]  In fact, they've been beaten a lot.
[2:56:04.740 --> 2:56:06.740]  But see, it's not just me, is it?
[2:56:06.740 --> 2:56:08.740]  They know it's you.
[2:56:08.740 --> 2:56:18.740]  So when I tell you that you're the ones taking action and that you're the ones changing the world by backing me.
[2:56:18.740 --> 2:56:33.740]  When I go to these events, when I confront the head of Google, when I confront all these globalists, you are the ones putting us in the field.
[2:56:33.740 --> 2:56:35.740]  And it's that simple.
[2:56:35.740 --> 2:56:36.740]  And I just want to be kept from the field.
[2:56:36.740 --> 2:56:42.740]  You know, I don't fear death, but I like it scared looking at my children going, man, someday I'm going to be weak and old.
[2:56:42.740 --> 2:56:43.740]  I'm going to be dead.
[2:56:43.740 --> 2:56:58.740]  I'm like, I better lay down foundations now and I better prepare people now and I better get ready now because that's the real test is putting your energy in now so that after you're gone, you live on for the fight.
[2:56:58.740 --> 2:57:03.740]  Because it's not enough to die in the fight for liberty.
[2:57:03.740 --> 2:57:04.740]  That's easy.
[2:57:04.740 --> 2:57:21.740]  You've got to be smart and make sure you lay down foundations and booby traps for the globalists so your full will is poured into this so they can take your body out, but your spirit still haunts them forever.
[2:57:21.740 --> 2:57:28.740]  And now I'm working on that in my life, pouring my spirit into everything I do.
[2:57:28.740 --> 2:57:36.740]  Pouring it into the sword of truth, pouring it into the army of justice, pouring it into the human future.
[2:57:36.740 --> 2:57:39.740]  And you know, I can actually feel victory in the future.
[2:57:39.740 --> 2:57:59.740]  Thank you very much.
[2:58:09.740 --> 2:58:31.740]  Thank you.
[2:58:31.740 --> 2:58:41.740]  Thank you very much.
[2:59:02.740 --> 2:59:30.740]  Thank you very much.
[2:59:30.740 --> 2:59:50.740]  Thank you very much.
[3:00:00.740 --> 3:00:15.740]  Thank you very much.
[3:00:15.740 --> 3:00:30.740]  My hope is that the new Congress is going to serve as a check to the rhetoric of fear and division and destruction and make sure that we are moving the country in the direction that the people have asked us for.
[3:00:30.740 --> 3:00:46.740]  I want to make sure that here in the United States we understand that there are other countries who take in so many people of the world's most pained people and in the United States we could do better.
[3:00:46.740 --> 3:01:01.740]  Minnesota Democratic Ilhan Omar appeared to criticize her colleagues for taking money from the Jewish lobby. She later apologized in a statement saying anti-Semitism is real and I'm grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.
[3:01:01.740 --> 3:01:19.740]  This apology comes after she issued a pair of tweets over the weekend suggesting that APAC, the pro-Israel lobbying group, has bought the support of her colleagues. This is not, however, the first time that Omar has had to apologize for tweets that some see as having anti-Semitic overtones.
[3:01:19.740 --> 3:01:28.740]  A couple of weeks ago she said she was sorry for this tweet from 2012 in which she said, quote, Israel has hypnotized the world.
[3:01:28.740 --> 3:01:42.740]  I don't think that the Congresswoman is perhaps appreciated the full weight of how it was heard by other people, although I don't believe it was intended in an anti-Semitic way.
[3:01:42.740 --> 3:01:59.740]  You're speaking at a fundraiser for care describing the 9-11 terrorist attack that killed 2,977 people and you said some people did something. What did you mean? In my speech I was talking about how our civil liberties as Muslims was being eroded.
[3:01:59.740 --> 3:02:20.740]  We have to take action when a president is openly violating the oath he took to the Constitution of the United States and the core values we aspire to. As Martin Luther King said, all we say to America is, be true to what you say on paper.
[3:02:20.740 --> 3:02:30.740]  A Daily Mail reported, Ilhan Omar told friends years ago that the man who went on to become her second husband was, in fact, her brother.
[3:02:30.740 --> 3:02:48.740]  Another person from Ilhan's community, Abdi Hakim Osman, is the first person to go on record to speak of how Omar said she wanted to get her brother papers so he could stay in the United States at a time when she was married to her first husband, Ahmed Hersey.
[3:02:48.740 --> 3:03:08.740]  Omar married her first husband, Hersey, in 2002 in a religious ceremony in Minnesota that was not recognized legally. In 2009, she legally married the reportedly openly gay Elmi, suspected of being her brother, in a secret Christian ceremony even though she is a Muslim.
[3:03:08.740 --> 3:03:23.740]  She later divorced Elmi, who had used his status to enroll in college, remarried Hersey legally only to divorce him a year later after having an affair with her congressional aide which led to wrecking that aide's marriage.
[3:03:23.740 --> 3:03:25.740]  Confused? I understand.
[3:03:25.740 --> 3:03:52.740]  Last year, two FBI agents looked into the allegations, but rather than open a full-blown investigation, simply shared their findings with ICE and the Department of Education. As the New York Post reported, if Omar did marry her brother, she could be found guilty of committing marriage fraud, a felony offense punishable with a prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000.
[3:03:52.740 --> 3:03:56.740]  John Bowne reporting.
[3:04:22.740 --> 3:04:51.740]  It's no secret.
[3:04:51.740 --> 3:05:04.740]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.

[3:05:34.740 --> 3:06:03.740]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:06:03.740 --> 3:06:07.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:06:34.740 --> 3:06:41.740]  I'm just going to tell you, I am haunted.
[3:06:41.740 --> 3:06:47.740]  When I say I'm just going to tell you, it's embarrassing for me to say something scares me.
[3:06:47.740 --> 3:07:04.740]  Because a big old mean man coming at me, it actually doesn't scare me. Like, wake something up and I just feel vicious and powerful and I'm ready to win. Or a big job. I don't look at it and think, oh, that's daunting. I kind of like it.
[3:07:04.740 --> 3:07:17.740]  And just running around attacking people and foaming at the mouth and big fat women going, I want communism and they go starve to death in North Korea or Venezuela. They kill them there.
[3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:31.740]  And dudes, all these dudes in dresses going, I love Bernie. I love communism. I'm like, communists kill people like you. They kill you in communist China. It's so aberrant and such a wall of idiocy.
[3:07:31.740 --> 3:07:51.740]  And you're like, well, that's just one mentally ill dude. And then you're there for hours and they're all hateful and stupid and stinking and dumb and gross and disconnected and just godless. Absolutely godless.
[3:07:51.740 --> 3:07:55.740]  And that's all I'm saying.
[3:07:55.740 --> 3:08:02.740]  So there's another big article up on info wars.com turns out 60 minutes has grilled Bernie Sanders.
[3:08:02.740 --> 3:08:14.740]  And this is quite the paradox because they're the ones promoting communism and socialism at the universities. It's the big banks funding that to sabotage people and make them think they've got to go to the government to be successful to ruin their lives.
[3:08:14.740 --> 3:08:27.740]  But then Bernie pops up and is capitalizing on the brainwashed half of millennials, identifying as a communist and socialist. And they go, whoa, whoa, whoa, you're supposed to have Biden who can't even string a sentence together.
[3:08:27.740 --> 3:08:33.740]  You're supposed to have Buddha judge and just all these nobodies.
[3:08:33.740 --> 3:08:43.740]  Bernie Sanders probably had 25,000 people yesterday at that rally. That's real. Hillary can't get 100. She still plans to come at the end and take over the broker convention.
[3:08:43.740 --> 3:08:47.740]  So people ask, well, I thought you're for populism.
[3:08:47.740 --> 3:08:54.740]  I'm not for the mad howl of democracy. The founders warned of you can manipulate the mob to want to take people's rights.
[3:08:54.740 --> 3:09:01.740]  So in a republic where democracy, but little D, we have rules that protect the minority as well.
[3:09:01.740 --> 3:09:14.740]  And Joe Salete is an expert on that. He's coming up. He can talk about it. But I just wanted to play this clip. The whole interviews up from 60 minutes on info wars.com of Anderson Cooper, the Vanderbilt.
[3:09:14.740 --> 3:09:20.740]  The Ford Foundation guy who's been pushing all this and pushing collectivism now.
[3:09:20.740 --> 3:09:31.740]  Looking at the fruit of it, telling him he's bad because he's not the establishment. It's a train wreck. And I predict they can't stop Sanders. They stole it four years ago. They're not going to steal it this time.
[3:09:31.740 --> 3:09:39.740]  And it's going to be spectacular. And I think cities are going to burn over it. I don't support Bernie at all. His supporters are the fruit of the Democratic Party.
[3:09:39.740 --> 3:09:54.740]  But they're mad that this old guy, this old shyster is stealing what they had planned at some future point for a communist takeover with offshore banks running and not a real communist takeover where things are just mismanaged and the country collapses.
[3:09:54.740 --> 3:10:05.740]  They don't want that. They want their synthetic communism. So here's Bernie Sanders on 60 minutes.
[3:10:05.740 --> 3:10:12.740]  Back in the 1980s, Sanders had some positive things to say about the former Soviet Union and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
[3:10:12.740 --> 3:10:14.740]  And everybody was totally convinced.
[3:10:14.740 --> 3:10:20.740]  Here he is explaining why the Cuban people didn't rise up and help the U.S. overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
[3:10:20.740 --> 3:10:24.740]  He educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.
[3:10:24.740 --> 3:10:30.740]  We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba. But you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad.
[3:10:30.740 --> 3:10:36.740]  You know, when Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program.
[3:10:36.740 --> 3:10:41.740]  Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it, there's a lot of dissidents imprisoned in Cuba.
[3:10:41.740 --> 3:10:43.740]  That's right. And we condemn that.
[3:10:43.740 --> 3:10:49.740]  Unlike Donald Trump, let's say I do not think that Kim Jong-un is a good friend.
[3:10:49.740 --> 3:10:52.740]  I don't trade love letters with a murdering dictator.
[3:10:52.740 --> 3:10:56.740]  Vladimir Putin, not a great friend of mine.
[3:10:56.740 --> 3:11:01.740]  Played two more clubs than go to Gerald Salente, but oh, there were some good things.
[3:11:01.740 --> 3:11:05.740]  Yeah, they have more doctors graduated per capita than the other country.
[3:11:05.740 --> 3:11:09.740]  They don't have any medicine, any MRIs, anything in Cuba.
[3:11:09.740 --> 3:11:13.740]  The women, beautiful women will have sex with you for a $5 thing of warmer.
[3:11:13.740 --> 3:11:17.740]  Dudes go there with a suitcase full of warmer to have sex like 100 women.
[3:11:17.740 --> 3:11:22.740]  I mean, they can't produce warmer. They can't make cars.
[3:11:22.740 --> 3:11:26.740]  They don't have enough toilet paper because the commies steal it all.
[3:11:26.740 --> 3:11:29.740]  They don't want you to have things. And he said that.
[3:11:29.740 --> 3:11:33.740]  He goes, you don't need, you don't need 30 types of deodorant.
[3:11:33.740 --> 3:11:37.740]  You don't need, you will need to stand in line.
[3:11:37.740 --> 3:11:41.740]  But to watch the system fight what it's created is just comical.
[3:11:41.740 --> 3:11:43.740]  Here's two more clips.
[3:11:43.740 --> 3:11:45.740]  Just on foreign policy.
[3:11:45.740 --> 3:11:47.740]  You said you believe in diplomacy.
[3:11:47.740 --> 3:11:53.740]  You're concerned Donald Trump is going to get us into an undisturbed war.
[3:11:53.740 --> 3:11:56.740]  Are there situations where you believe military action is?
[3:11:56.740 --> 3:11:58.740]  Absolutely, of course I do.
[3:11:58.740 --> 3:12:00.740]  You know, hopefully it's rare.
[3:12:00.740 --> 3:12:05.740]  If there's a capitalist country or it's Christian, we blow it up.
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:07.740]  We invade with Muslims.
[3:12:07.740 --> 3:12:10.740]  It'll start the clip over.
[3:12:10.740 --> 3:12:12.740]  Just on foreign policy.
[3:12:12.740 --> 3:12:14.740]  You said you believe in diplomacy.
[3:12:14.740 --> 3:12:16.740]  You're concerned Donald Trump is going to get us into an undisturbed war.
[3:12:16.740 --> 3:12:20.740]  Are there situations where you believe military action is?
[3:12:20.740 --> 3:12:22.740]  Absolutely, of course I do.
[3:12:22.740 --> 3:12:25.740]  You know, hopefully it's as rare as possible.
[3:12:25.740 --> 3:12:28.740]  But yeah, we have the best military in the world.
[3:12:28.740 --> 3:12:30.740]  What would your criteria be for military action?
[3:12:30.740 --> 3:12:33.740]  Threats against the American people, to be sure.
[3:12:33.740 --> 3:12:35.740]  Pause again.
[3:12:35.740 --> 3:12:36.740]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[3:12:36.740 --> 3:12:38.740]  America sucks.
[3:12:38.740 --> 3:12:40.740]  He's an admitted communist.
[3:12:40.740 --> 3:12:49.740]  But we've got the best military in the world.
[3:12:49.740 --> 3:12:52.740]  Again, I don't like how our military is used.
[3:12:52.740 --> 3:12:54.740]  But you can't say it's not the best in the world.
[3:12:54.740 --> 3:12:56.740]  So how's it the best, dude?
[3:12:56.740 --> 3:13:03.740]  It's not Cuba where people can't get aspirin dumbass because they can't produce it.
[3:13:03.740 --> 3:13:05.740]  Because all Commies do is run people's lives.
[3:13:05.740 --> 3:13:07.740]  Continue.
[3:13:07.740 --> 3:13:10.740]  Threats against the American people, to be sure.
[3:13:10.740 --> 3:13:12.740]  Threats against our allies.
[3:13:12.740 --> 3:13:14.740]  I believe in orders.
[3:13:14.740 --> 3:13:18.740]  I believe that the United States, everything being equal,
[3:13:18.740 --> 3:13:23.740]  should be working with other countries in alliance, not doing it alone.
[3:13:23.740 --> 3:13:27.740]  If China took military action against Taiwan, is that something you would have?
[3:13:27.740 --> 3:13:31.740]  I mean, I think we have got to make it clear to countries around the world
[3:13:31.740 --> 3:13:36.740]  that we will not sit by and allow invasions to take place.
[3:13:36.740 --> 3:13:38.740]  Would you meet with Kim Jong-un?
[3:13:38.740 --> 3:13:42.740]  Yeah. I mean, I've criticized Trump for everything under the world, under the sun.
[3:13:42.740 --> 3:13:49.740]  But meeting with people who are antagonistic is to me not a bad thing to do.
[3:13:49.740 --> 3:13:53.740]  I think, unfortunately, Trump went into that meeting unprepared.
[3:13:53.740 --> 3:13:56.740]  I think it was a photo opportunity
[3:13:56.740 --> 3:14:02.740]  and did not have the kind of diplomatic work necessary to make it a success.
[3:14:02.740 --> 3:14:08.740]  But I do not have a problem with sitting down with adversaries all over the world.
[3:14:08.740 --> 3:14:13.740]  So Sanders is trying to backtrack.
[3:14:13.740 --> 3:14:17.740]  He's trying to backtrack from everything he said he is and what he stood for.
[3:14:17.740 --> 3:14:19.740]  The man is a complete fraud.
[3:14:19.740 --> 3:14:22.740]  But regardless, the Democratic establishment is blocking him
[3:14:22.740 --> 3:14:24.740]  because they don't own him, they don't run him.
[3:14:24.740 --> 3:14:29.740]  There's no doubt Bernie Sanders, every night when he goes to bed, he's running Bernie Sanders.
[3:14:29.740 --> 3:14:32.740]  I mean, he let Hillary steal the nomination and bow down to that.
[3:14:32.740 --> 3:14:33.740]  But he made that decision.
[3:14:33.740 --> 3:14:36.740]  There's not committees telling Bernie Sanders what to do.
[3:14:36.740 --> 3:14:39.740]  And just like Donald Trump, the system doesn't like it
[3:14:39.740 --> 3:14:43.740]  because Bernie Sanders is his own misguided man.
[3:14:43.740 --> 3:14:44.740]  That's my view.
[3:14:44.740 --> 3:14:47.740]  Gerald Solente, the top friend's forecaster, is going to take over.
[3:14:47.740 --> 3:14:49.740]  Can't wait to eat my lunch and listen to him talk.
[3:14:49.740 --> 3:14:50.740]  And I'll probably be back today.
[3:14:50.740 --> 3:14:53.740]  The war rooms come up on Troyer in about 45 minutes.
[3:14:53.740 --> 3:14:57.740]  Please don't forget we have back in stock the ultimate turmeric formula.
[3:14:57.740 --> 3:14:59.740]  Bodies just got back in yesterday.

[3:17:57.740 --> 3:17:59.740]  But I'll be honest with you.
[3:17:59.740 --> 3:18:01.740]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports
[3:18:01.740 --> 3:18:04.740]  because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[3:18:04.740 --> 3:18:06.740]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[3:18:06.740 --> 3:18:07.740]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[3:18:07.740 --> 3:18:09.740]  But here's the bottom line.
[3:18:09.740 --> 3:18:11.740]  We're barely paying the bills here.

[3:18:58.740 --> 3:19:00.740]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[3:19:00.740 --> 3:19:04.740]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work.

[3:19:17.740 --> 3:19:21.740]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine
[3:19:21.740 --> 3:19:24.740]  because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[3:19:24.740 --> 3:19:26.740]  And people told me about it for years
[3:19:26.740 --> 3:19:28.740]  and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful
[3:19:28.740 --> 3:19:30.740]  that finally I listened to Dr. Grip
[3:19:30.740 --> 3:19:34.740]  like eight years ago and started taking true iodine,
[3:19:34.740 --> 3:19:36.740]  atomic iodine.

[3:20:20.740 --> 3:20:26.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:26.740 --> 3:20:30.740]  Hello, hello.
[3:20:30.740 --> 3:20:32.740]  Great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:32.740 --> 3:20:33.740]  Yep.
[3:20:33.740 --> 3:20:36.740]  And I'm right on board with Alex
[3:20:36.740 --> 3:20:39.740]  and a lot of things that he says about Bernie Sanders.
[3:20:39.740 --> 3:20:42.740]  And in fact, it was our lead story.
[3:20:42.740 --> 3:20:45.740]  In the Weekly Trends Journal,
[3:20:45.740 --> 3:20:48.740]  Sanders has a shot to dump Trump.
[3:20:48.740 --> 3:20:50.740]  And I'm no fan.
[3:20:50.740 --> 3:20:52.740]  I'm no fan actually of any of them.
[3:20:52.740 --> 3:20:54.740]  I'm a political atheist.
[3:20:54.740 --> 3:20:56.740]  A lot of some things I like that Trump does,
[3:20:56.740 --> 3:20:58.740]  other things I don't like.
[3:20:58.740 --> 3:21:00.740]  Sanders is total phony.
[3:21:00.740 --> 3:21:02.740]  I'll give you free education.
[3:21:02.740 --> 3:21:04.740]  I'll give you free healthcare.
[3:21:04.740 --> 3:21:06.740]  You buy two conditions.
[3:21:06.740 --> 3:21:07.740]  You got one free.
[3:21:07.740 --> 3:21:09.740]  That guy's full of baloney
[3:21:09.740 --> 3:21:12.740]  and sucking off the public tit his whole life.
[3:21:12.740 --> 3:21:14.740]  Never had a job.
[3:21:14.740 --> 3:21:15.740]  And he's two-faced.
[3:21:15.740 --> 3:21:18.740]  All these dumb-o-craps believe his crap.
[3:21:18.740 --> 3:21:21.740]  I voted against the Iraq war?
[3:21:21.740 --> 3:21:24.740]  Hey, Bernie boy.
[3:21:24.740 --> 3:21:27.740]  You voted for the Afghan war.
[3:21:27.740 --> 3:21:30.740]  You voted for Bill Clinton's murder
[3:21:30.740 --> 3:21:35.740]  of over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five.
[3:21:35.740 --> 3:21:38.740]  When he puts sanctions on them.
[3:21:38.740 --> 3:21:41.740]  If you, of course, you folks in info wars know that story
[3:21:41.740 --> 3:21:44.740]  with Madeleine, not all that bright.
[3:21:44.740 --> 3:21:48.740]  The U.N. ambassador to the United States
[3:21:48.740 --> 3:21:53.740]  on Leslie Stahl in 60 minutes.
[3:21:53.740 --> 3:21:56.740]  When she was asked if the price of 500,000 Iraqi children
[3:21:56.740 --> 3:21:59.740]  dead was worth the price of sanctions,
[3:21:59.740 --> 3:22:01.740]  she said, yes it is.
[3:22:01.740 --> 3:22:03.740]  That's your Bernie.
[3:22:03.740 --> 3:22:05.740]  BS Bernie.
[3:22:05.740 --> 3:22:06.740]  BS Bernie.
[3:22:06.740 --> 3:22:10.740]  Let's bring those F-35s into the Burlington Air Force.
[3:22:10.740 --> 3:22:11.740]  Airport.
[3:22:11.740 --> 3:22:12.740]  Yep.
[3:22:12.740 --> 3:22:14.740]  Guy's full of baloney.
[3:22:14.740 --> 3:22:17.740]  And you heard him in that interview.
[3:22:17.740 --> 3:22:19.740]  He's no peace candidate.
[3:22:19.740 --> 3:22:21.740]  He's another one of these little boys
[3:22:21.740 --> 3:22:24.740]  too fat to fight that calls for peace
[3:22:24.740 --> 3:22:28.740]  but when he wants to call for war, he calls for it.
[3:22:28.740 --> 3:22:30.740]  Yeah, you heard him.
[3:22:30.740 --> 3:22:33.740]  Any country that we think is going to threaten us
[3:22:33.740 --> 3:22:36.740]  will take pre-emptive measures against Iran
[3:22:36.740 --> 3:22:38.740]  and North Korea.
[3:22:38.740 --> 3:22:42.740]  He said in another interview with the toilet paper
[3:22:42.740 --> 3:22:46.740]  record in New York Times, a phony, phony freak.
[3:22:46.740 --> 3:22:49.740]  And the reason why we called, remember,
[3:22:49.740 --> 3:22:53.740]  we called Trump with the first magazine,
[3:22:53.740 --> 3:22:58.740]  the first magazine in the entire United States,
[3:22:58.740 --> 3:23:01.740]  if not the world, that called Trump a winner
[3:23:01.740 --> 3:23:05.740]  in May of 2016, it's in your Trends Journal.
[3:23:05.740 --> 3:23:08.740]  I call things the way I see them, not the way I like them.
[3:23:08.740 --> 3:23:10.740]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[3:23:10.740 --> 3:23:12.740]  I look at things through the way they are,
[3:23:12.740 --> 3:23:14.740]  not the way I want them to be.
[3:23:14.740 --> 3:23:19.740]  And BS Bernie, he got a shot at the White House
[3:23:19.740 --> 3:23:23.740]  if he doesn't get that heart attack as something else
[3:23:23.740 --> 3:23:27.740]  before the 2020 election.
[3:23:27.740 --> 3:23:30.740]  And the reason why I called him,
[3:23:30.740 --> 3:23:33.740]  I changed the forecast because you'll get at my top trends
[3:23:33.740 --> 3:23:37.740]  of 2020, Trump by default in 2020.
[3:23:37.740 --> 3:23:41.740]  And I said the default of the Democrats
[3:23:41.740 --> 3:23:45.740]  because they don't have anybody good to run against them.
[3:23:45.740 --> 3:23:47.740]  So let's go back to Sanders.
[3:23:47.740 --> 3:23:50.740]  Why did I change it?
[3:23:50.740 --> 3:23:52.740]  We take a global-nomic perspective.
[3:23:52.740 --> 3:23:54.740]  We see what's going on around the world
[3:23:54.740 --> 3:23:57.740]  to make connections between different fields.
[3:23:57.740 --> 3:24:03.740]  A few weeks ago, there was an election in Ireland.
[3:24:03.740 --> 3:24:07.740]  Ireland, I love Ireland, I love the Irish people.
[3:24:07.740 --> 3:24:09.740]  I went to an all-Irish Catholic school.
[3:24:09.740 --> 3:24:12.740]  I was one of three Italian kids there.
[3:24:12.740 --> 3:24:16.740]  I fell in love with Theresa McKelvie in my first communion.
[3:24:16.740 --> 3:24:19.740]  So I love the Irish.
[3:24:19.740 --> 3:24:21.740]  I have a picture of me and her in my zizzy book
[3:24:21.740 --> 3:24:23.740]  when Zizzy gave Honey Boy.
[3:24:23.740 --> 3:24:26.740]  I was holding hands in our first communion.
[3:24:26.740 --> 3:24:28.740]  I love the Irish, and I love going there.
[3:24:28.740 --> 3:24:30.740]  Wonderful people.
[3:24:30.740 --> 3:24:32.740]  They had an election.
[3:24:32.740 --> 3:24:35.740]  Sinn Féin won.
[3:24:35.740 --> 3:24:37.740]  Out of nowhere.
[3:24:37.740 --> 3:24:43.740]  Knocked out established parties that were in control 100 years.
[3:24:43.740 --> 3:24:44.740]  Bloomed away.
[3:24:44.740 --> 3:24:46.740]  Why?
[3:24:46.740 --> 3:24:52.740]  The same reason that Sanders could win.
[3:24:52.740 --> 3:24:59.740]  The young people, the young people, they have no future.
[3:24:59.740 --> 3:25:02.740]  Ireland gives all the breaks to the apples and the Googles
[3:25:02.740 --> 3:25:04.740]  and all the rest.
[3:25:04.740 --> 3:25:10.740]  Like the U.S.S.A., all the money goes to the top.
[3:25:10.740 --> 3:25:13.740]  And I'm not making those numbers up.
[3:25:13.740 --> 3:25:15.740]  You got them.
[3:25:15.740 --> 3:25:18.740]  In the United States, Gates, Bezos, and Buffett
[3:25:18.740 --> 3:25:23.740]  got more dough than half America's population combined.
[3:25:23.740 --> 3:25:29.740]  90% of all the assets in the equity markets controlled by 10%.
[3:25:29.740 --> 3:25:34.740]  Young people, what do they got?
[3:25:34.740 --> 3:25:40.740]  Get out of college with what, 30, 40, $50,000 worth of debt?
[3:25:40.740 --> 3:25:43.740]  When I got out of college, I had $1,500 worth of debt.
[3:25:43.740 --> 3:25:48.740]  And that was a lot of money back then.
[3:25:48.740 --> 3:25:51.740]  1969.
[3:25:51.740 --> 3:25:58.740]  I should have graduated in 1968, but I got left back in the fifth grade.
[3:25:58.740 --> 3:26:00.740]  Miserable nun, may she rot in hell.
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:03.740]  Sister Marie Rose there.
[3:26:03.740 --> 3:26:06.740]  One day, she grabbed me by my little blue tie
[3:26:06.740 --> 3:26:09.740]  and knocked the hell out of me.
[3:26:09.740 --> 3:26:14.740]  I left her in my middle ear and broke my ear drum and then left me back.
[3:26:14.740 --> 3:26:16.740]  I'm just thankful Father Foley was a lady's man.
[3:26:16.740 --> 3:26:18.740]  It could have been a lot worse.
[3:26:18.740 --> 3:26:25.740]  Anyway, going back to $1,500 worth of debt, that was a lot of money.
[3:26:25.740 --> 3:26:29.740]  Now kids are getting out, young people, 40, 50.
[3:26:29.740 --> 3:26:34.740]  I think the average is like $38,000 in debt.
[3:26:34.740 --> 3:26:35.740]  They're going for Sanders.
[3:26:35.740 --> 3:26:37.740]  They got no future.
[3:26:37.740 --> 3:26:42.740]  Before the demo craps and the repulsive kins did away with the antitrust laws,
[3:26:42.740 --> 3:26:46.740]  there was this thing called mom and pop stores, dress shops, men's shops.
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:51.740]  Oh, a thing called drug stores before CVS's and Walgreens took them all over.
[3:26:51.740 --> 3:26:56.740]  Things called stationary stores before the staples.
[3:26:56.740 --> 3:27:01.740]  Things called hardware stores before the Lowe's and the Home Depots.
[3:27:01.740 --> 3:27:04.740]  There was a middle class.
[3:27:04.740 --> 3:27:07.740]  The young people, what are they doing?
[3:27:07.740 --> 3:27:12.740]  They're going to work for Amazon, lifting boxes, doing Lowe's heavy duty work.
[3:27:12.740 --> 3:27:15.740]  And what do they make?
[3:27:15.740 --> 3:27:20.740]  $62.50 a week by the time they pay their taxes and everything else in the hernia.
[3:27:20.740 --> 3:27:22.740]  That's why they're going for Sanders.
[3:27:22.740 --> 3:27:25.740]  The same reason why they won in Ireland.
[3:27:25.740 --> 3:27:27.740]  That's what the people mentioned.
[3:27:27.740 --> 3:27:32.740]  Healthcare, rents, unaffordable housing to buy.
[3:27:32.740 --> 3:27:35.740]  Oh, and homeless.
[3:27:35.740 --> 3:27:37.740]  Homeless.
[3:27:37.740 --> 3:27:39.740]  One of my top trends for 2020.
[3:27:39.740 --> 3:27:42.740]  Homeless and helpless.
[3:27:42.740 --> 3:27:46.740]  That's who voted Sinn Féin in.
[3:27:46.740 --> 3:27:51.740]  And that's who could bring in Sanders.
[3:27:51.740 --> 3:27:53.740]  I'll give you free education.
[3:27:53.740 --> 3:27:56.740]  Yeah.
[3:27:56.740 --> 3:27:58.740]  The people have nothing.
[3:27:58.740 --> 3:28:04.740]  The younger generation, when I was a young guy, every poll that used to come out,
[3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:11.740]  they used to ask, will the future be better than the past or the past better than the future?
[3:28:11.740 --> 3:28:16.740]  And you know what all the polls showed?
[3:28:16.740 --> 3:28:19.740]  The future would be better.
[3:28:19.740 --> 3:28:25.740]  And now it's make America great again, going back to the past.
[3:28:25.740 --> 3:28:31.740]  So the reason Sanders is going to win the nomination,
[3:28:31.740 --> 3:28:38.740]  and he has a shot at the election is because of the youth.
[3:28:38.740 --> 3:28:41.740]  And there are more of them than us.
[3:28:41.740 --> 3:28:43.740]  And there are other reasons as well.
[3:28:43.740 --> 3:28:45.740]  And we come back.
[3:28:45.740 --> 3:28:47.740]  We're going to tell you what they are.
[3:28:47.740 --> 3:28:50.740]  Remember, support info.
[3:28:50.740 --> 3:28:53.740]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[3:28:53.740 --> 3:28:56.740]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[3:28:56.740 --> 3:29:00.740]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker,

[3:35:12.740 --> 3:35:16.740]  Silence.
[3:35:16.740 --> 3:35:34.700]  about 60 million. Oh, 2,000 people died in China. How many people? 1.4 billion? One
[3:35:34.700 --> 3:35:43.260]  country after another, the numbers are tiny. Four sixth biggest outside of China. But this
[3:35:43.260 --> 3:35:50.300]  is really doing a number on the equity markets, which, again, needed to come under some kind
[3:35:50.300 --> 3:36:05.300]  of a correction. And it corrected. What are people doing? They're buying gold. Because
[3:36:05.300 --> 3:36:12.220]  the money has just been flowing in. They've been dumping it out of the thin air. With
[3:36:12.220 --> 3:36:20.860]  the repo markets over 7 trillion pumped in since September. According to the Levy Institute
[3:36:20.860 --> 3:36:34.540]  from 2007 to 2010, they pumped in $29 trillion into the banksters system to prop it up artificially.
[3:36:34.540 --> 3:36:39.460]  So the markets are due for a correction, but this is making it a lot worse because it's
[3:36:39.460 --> 3:36:47.300]  going to hit China very hard. You're looking at car sales in China of 92%. 92%. That's
[3:36:47.300 --> 3:36:59.820]  the world's biggest buyer of automobiles. It's going to hurt. Going back to the election.
[3:36:59.820 --> 3:37:07.460]  It's what used to say in the Clinton administration when he was running for office in 1992. The
[3:37:07.460 --> 3:37:16.140]  campaign theme, it's the economy's stupid. And that's what this is going to be about
[3:37:16.140 --> 3:37:22.780]  again. It's the economy. And Trump is doing very good on the economy. You're seeing the
[3:37:22.780 --> 3:37:33.380]  numbers coming out. Very positive. That could change rapidly and dramatically as we speak.
[3:37:33.380 --> 3:37:47.540]  What is the Dow down now? About 900 points? Gold. Gold spiked up today over $30 an ounce.
[3:37:47.540 --> 3:37:56.500]  Move back down. It's still up about 15 bucks. By the way, as you well know, in our Trends
[3:37:56.500 --> 3:38:02.420]  Journal, we sent the trend alert out and I've been on Alex Jones' show talking about it
[3:38:02.420 --> 3:38:09.420]  with David Knight. Back in June, June 6, we sent out a trend alert. The gold bull run
[3:38:09.420 --> 3:38:20.540]  has begun. Gold back then was over $300 cheaper than it is today. And that's why you subscribe
[3:38:20.540 --> 3:38:25.460]  to the Trends Journal. And that's why I love being on with Alex Jones. Yeah, there it is,
[3:38:25.460 --> 3:38:32.100]  the gold bull run. Because they keep you ahead of the news and on top of the trends. We're
[3:38:32.100 --> 3:38:39.060]  all in this together to bring liberty, love, joy, and beauty to the United States. And
[3:38:39.060 --> 3:38:44.380]  that's why I'm against foreign entanglements. We have no business being in these countries.
[3:38:44.380 --> 3:38:52.820]  Illegally in Syria, illegally in Iraq, destroyed Libya. One place after another, I'm totally
[3:38:52.820 --> 3:38:59.980]  against it. I'm an American. And that's what I look out for. I protect America and all
[3:38:59.980 --> 3:39:06.220]  my life. Foreign country is not my business. You got your own problems, not mine. I believe
[3:39:06.220 --> 3:39:10.980]  in the Founding Fathers, George Washington, no foreign entanglements. So going back to
[3:39:10.980 --> 3:39:18.660]  Sanders, that's what's going to determine the election. How things are doing economically
[3:39:18.660 --> 3:39:31.260]  by election day this year. Going back to the equity markets. Gold. I believe gold spiked
[3:39:31.260 --> 3:39:41.780]  too quickly right now. And it will have a pullback. Probably $100. At least. Bringing
[3:39:41.780 --> 3:39:54.460]  it down to 1550 is still pretty good. And move back up. It may not go down. If it does
[3:39:54.460 --> 3:40:02.140]  not go down and continues to rise, it will spike toward the 2000 mark. And in that gold
[3:40:02.140 --> 3:40:10.500]  bull run forecast, my forecast was the gold had a break over $1,450 an ounce. And then
[3:40:10.500 --> 3:40:17.540]  it would sharply spike above. Remember, gold is $1,332 an ounce when I said that. And that's
[3:40:17.540 --> 3:40:29.140]  exactly what happened. Gold went above $1,450 an ounce. Boom. Here we are today, $1,650.
[3:40:29.140 --> 3:40:36.580]  So the future economically is very shaky. The information is there. Again, we write
[3:40:36.580 --> 3:40:47.300]  about it every week. Over there in Turkey, they just lowered interest rates. Actually,
[3:40:47.300 --> 3:40:52.620]  they have negative interest rates when you can count inflation into it. Euro extends
[3:40:52.620 --> 3:41:02.060]  its fall. Profit warnings hit record in Germany. This is the financial times. I'm going to
[3:41:02.060 --> 3:41:12.060]  be making this stuff up. Germany. Germany is that far away from recession. This is in
[3:41:12.060 --> 3:41:21.660]  Zimbabwe. This is the strongest economy in Europe. European growth in the last quarter
[3:41:21.660 --> 3:41:39.300]  of 2019 was no growth at all. 0.1%. So this coronavirus is hitting at a time of weakness.
[3:41:39.300 --> 3:41:45.100]  If it hit at a time of strength, it would be different. But again, I don't see it being
[3:41:45.100 --> 3:41:58.420]  as big as you're claiming it to be, only going by the numbers. China, again, over 2,000 people
[3:41:58.420 --> 3:42:09.100]  have died. Last year, over 300,000 died from effects of air pollution. Yeah, but we won't
[3:42:09.100 --> 3:42:16.100]  talk about that. And then again, the poisons they put in our food and the air and the water
[3:42:16.100 --> 3:42:22.820]  and everything else. We're not talking about a lot of people here, but it's going to have
[3:42:22.820 --> 3:42:33.060]  an impact, particularly in China and on the global marketplace. So gold is still golden.
[3:42:33.060 --> 3:42:40.180]  Where is this going? We're going to know in a couple of more days. If the markets continue
[3:42:40.180 --> 3:42:51.140]  to decline, greatest depression may escalate. It may happen before 2021. I don't think so.
[3:42:51.140 --> 3:42:57.020]  The evidence is overwhelming. Coronavirus is a manmade bio weapon designed to destroy
[3:42:57.020 --> 3:43:03.100]  nation states, economies and free peoples and usher in a planetary government. This
[3:43:03.100 --> 3:43:08.220]  is how the globalists are striking back. Here's a fortune headline today. Fears of global
[3:43:08.220 --> 3:43:15.020]  coronavirus contagion rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home. And that's just
[3:43:15.020 --> 3:43:22.140]  in one nation. Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China. The reporting
[3:43:22.140 --> 3:43:30.660]  it could cut their sales in half this year. That's how major this is. Everyone needs to
[3:43:30.660 --> 3:43:37.860]  be prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games. Info wars will continue to report the latest
[3:43:37.860 --> 3:43:42.300]  information as it comes out. Regardless of the fact of the establishment will try to
[3:43:42.300 --> 3:43:46.860]  punish us for telling the truth. We need you to step into the plate and help spread the
[3:43:46.860 --> 3:43:53.180]  word about band.video and info wars dot com today. There's roughly only 260 days left
[3:43:53.180 --> 3:43:57.340]  until the 2020 election. And already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen. The
[3:43:57.340 --> 3:44:00.860]  globalists are trying to plunge the economy. They're trying to start wars. They're trying
[3:44:00.860 --> 3:44:04.260]  to overthrow the president. They're trying to silence free speech. They're trying to
[3:44:04.260 --> 3:44:08.620]  trigger riots in the streets. But everything they do is blowing up in their face. We the
[3:44:08.620 --> 3:44:13.380]  people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their
[3:44:13.380 --> 3:44:19.020]  lies and we have to be prepared in case things go south. That's why it's so critical to go

[3:44:51.820 --> 3:44:56.060]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[3:44:56.060 --> 3:45:00.220]  for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best
[3:45:00.220 --> 3:45:03.380]  toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling
[3:45:03.380 --> 3:45:08.660]  me you got to get up there and tell people. And so here I am telling people super silver
[3:45:08.660 --> 3:45:14.340]  whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and
[3:45:14.340 --> 3:45:19.020]  I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference
[3:45:19.020 --> 3:45:23.540]  the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this,
[3:45:23.540 --> 3:45:28.140]  they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after
[3:45:28.140 --> 3:45:33.620]  I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are
[3:45:33.620 --> 3:45:39.220]  happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:52.060]  rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[3:45:52.060 --> 3:45:56.860]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food. But I know for a fact
[3:45:56.860 --> 3:46:01.620]  from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it. Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[3:46:01.620 --> 3:46:05.580]  Follow this pattern over and over again. I've been already for 25 years. I've had storeable
[3:46:05.580 --> 3:46:10.460]  food for a long time and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during
[3:46:10.460 --> 3:46:14.780]  normal times. But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[3:46:14.780 --> 3:46:18.580]  They'll still take your orders. That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot supply
[3:46:18.580 --> 3:46:23.260]  now the biggest most trusted company out there and I became a private label or forum because
[3:46:23.260 --> 3:46:26.380]  they actually have it on hand. They actually give it delivered to you on time. They do
[3:46:26.380 --> 3:46:29.260]  what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over
[3:46:29.260 --> 3:46:33.300]  and over again and they're good people. Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping
[3:46:33.300 --> 3:46:36.580]  because they've got the food, but they got a package at record level orders. Now it's
[3:46:36.580 --> 3:46:41.780]  10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus. So get your orders at an
[3:46:41.780 --> 3:46:45.860]  infowarstore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first, they're in our system, it
[3:46:45.860 --> 3:46:50.300]  goes right to them, then it funds the info as well. So get prepared infowarstore.com with
[3:46:50.300 --> 3:46:55.660]  storeable foods.
[3:46:55.660 --> 3:47:12.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:12.300 --> 3:47:20.140]  Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:20.140 --> 3:47:28.900]  Hello, hello. Great being on the Alex Jones show. And remember, remember, if you want
[3:47:28.900 --> 3:47:36.380]  the truth to prevail, do what you can to support info wars. In info wars, life selects storeable
[3:47:36.380 --> 3:47:44.580]  foods and ask one for you to consider, particularly as Goodbye Rosie, Queen of Coronavirus starts
[3:47:44.580 --> 3:47:50.460]  hitting everywhere. Look at how the government shut down the place. Look what they do. Italy,
[3:47:50.460 --> 3:47:56.500]  you name it, Korea, South Korea, one after another, closing down China. You're going
[3:47:56.500 --> 3:48:02.540]  to want to have storeable foods and with the rise of coronavirus, troubles brewing constantly
[3:48:02.540 --> 3:48:11.100]  in other nations and more danger is constantly growing overseas. So info wars has been officially
[3:48:11.100 --> 3:48:17.540]  notified by their vendors that food prices are on the rise due to dramatically increased
[3:48:17.540 --> 3:48:25.100]  level of demand. And thanks to their focus on long term contracts to provide for our
[3:48:25.100 --> 3:48:32.740]  customers, we're able to hold on to those prices for a little bit longer at info wars.
[3:48:32.740 --> 3:48:37.940]  It's already getting more difficult to order storeable foods nationwide and the suppliers
[3:48:37.940 --> 3:48:46.340]  are facing a 5 to 10% increase on every option of emergency foods available. And they can't
[3:48:46.340 --> 3:48:52.660]  hold out on raising these prices forever. So eventually, even info wars is going to
[3:48:52.660 --> 3:48:58.540]  need to increase the prices with demand. So right now, you should get your order in three
[3:48:58.540 --> 3:49:05.580]  weeks. However, this is getting delayed with each passing minute. So secure your spot now.
[3:49:05.580 --> 3:49:11.660]  Some of the suppliers aren't able to ship at all due to this huge demand. So there you
[3:49:11.660 --> 3:49:18.340]  got it. And this is real because a lot of things is slowing down. And prices are going
[3:49:18.340 --> 3:49:25.940]  up in the food business. So you want to get it now while it's still hot and available
[3:49:25.940 --> 3:49:31.300]  because you can see what the governments do. They shut down whenever they want to me. What's
[3:49:31.300 --> 3:49:39.220]  going on in China in a way they've like 140 million quarantining them 140 million people.
[3:49:39.220 --> 3:49:45.780]  This is this is a test. This is a test. And the doctors that I've spoken to are saying
[3:49:45.780 --> 3:49:51.780]  that the coronavirus is affecting mostly the elderly people that are ill already chronically
[3:49:51.780 --> 3:49:59.500]  ill, not hitting young people. And it's another virus. And again, according to the data, Google
[3:49:59.500 --> 3:50:09.260]  it up. How many people died of the flu last year in the United States? 61,000. And coronavirus.
[3:50:09.260 --> 3:50:13.180]  But you can see what's going to happen. So you're going to want to have on hand what
[3:50:13.180 --> 3:50:18.660]  you need on hand. And again, anything could happen. Things are out of the shelves empty
[3:50:18.660 --> 3:50:23.860]  out when these crises happen. And you can't get what you want. And it's only going to
[3:50:23.860 --> 3:50:28.300]  get worse when this happens again. And it may be something else other than coronavirus.
[3:50:28.300 --> 3:50:32.580]  As I say, I don't want to hear about climate change. You're killing us now with all the
[3:50:32.580 --> 3:50:37.580]  poisons that are pumping into everything. So anything could outbreak at any time. You
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:42.100]  know, why don't we just mention more about the political presidential reality shows,
[3:50:42.100 --> 3:50:52.060]  I call it. You know, I had that big debate right in Las Vegas, Paris, open hotel over
[3:50:52.060 --> 3:50:59.100]  there. It's funny. Last time I was there is about 2000. He's about 2012. I had just come
[3:50:59.100 --> 3:51:06.420]  back from Paris and I had to do a gig in Las Vegas and ended up doing it at that place.
[3:51:06.420 --> 3:51:17.900]  But anyway, the debates. Nothing, nothing serious about all of America's foreign entanglements.
[3:51:17.900 --> 3:51:24.460]  Nothing serious about the war. And that Buttigieg, whatever his name is, that guy is nothing
[3:51:24.460 --> 3:51:33.060]  more to me than a CIA plant. A little boy of nothing. Groom Prime knows how to say the
[3:51:33.060 --> 3:51:42.860]  words poethically. Harvard, boy. Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[3:51:42.860 --> 3:51:51.820]  Yep, he puts on the show. And you read his comments after he lost. Again, a little boy
[3:51:51.820 --> 3:52:02.340]  of nothing. A zero, a zero from nowhere. He did nothing other than lie a lot about what
[3:52:02.340 --> 3:52:08.940]  he did. But people like him because the same reason they liked Obama. He knew how to be
[3:52:08.940 --> 3:52:16.580]  as perfectly. Yeah, as we used to say in a Bronx, BS has its own sound and it farts out
[3:52:16.580 --> 3:52:23.620]  of the Buttigieg boy. He went on to say in a speech delivered soon after media outlets
[3:52:23.620 --> 3:52:32.740]  call the caucuses the Sanders. Buttigieg warned Democrats, quote, take a sober look at what's
[3:52:32.740 --> 3:52:44.340]  at stake before we rush to nominate Senator Sanders. Instead, you should elect me, a guy
[3:52:44.340 --> 3:52:52.180]  that's nothing more than a puppet. Boy in the box. This is the kind of crap he puts
[3:52:52.180 --> 3:52:59.140]  out. Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all, we completely own a private insurance. That would
[3:52:59.140 --> 3:53:06.100]  not be okay with me. Look what happened when Obama gave us Obamacare, those private insurance
[3:53:06.100 --> 3:53:12.380]  companies. They made a lot of dough. It ain't Obamacare. So Obama, I don't care. I want
[3:53:12.380 --> 3:53:16.740]  to make the rich guys richer just like he did with our dough to give it to the banksters.
[3:53:16.740 --> 3:53:22.260]  And again, I'm no Bernie Sanders fan at all. But when they talk about this country becoming
[3:53:22.260 --> 3:53:31.260]  socialist and not capitalist, capitalism is long gone in America. In capitalism, boys
[3:53:31.260 --> 3:53:40.900]  and girls and children of all ages, there's no such thing as too big to fail. We got to
[3:53:40.900 --> 3:53:45.940]  bail out the two bigs. And we heard that guy, Eric Holder, hold this, you know, remember
[3:53:45.940 --> 3:54:00.180]  Obama's attorney general. The banksters were too big to jail. And they still are. From
[3:54:00.180 --> 3:54:05.700]  Saturday's toilet paper record. And they put these stories on Saturday and put them out
[3:54:05.700 --> 3:54:10.500]  in the news because that's the least watched news day and red newspaper day. Oh, anybody's
[3:54:10.500 --> 3:54:22.060]  reading anymore. Wells Fargo to pay $3 billion in fraud action settlement. Fraud action
[3:54:22.060 --> 3:54:30.940]  settlement, $3 billion. Let anybody go to jail. Let any of the banksters go to jail
[3:54:30.940 --> 3:54:40.020]  for screwing millions of people, giving them fake accounts, robbing billions, making the
[3:54:40.020 --> 3:54:53.260]  lives miserable for millions. Who'll go to jail? Nobody. That's why Sanders has a shot
[3:54:53.260 --> 3:55:00.340]  at winning is because of this inequality. And that's what he's playing on. And it's
[3:55:00.340 --> 3:55:07.820]  a smart card to play. You know the story. You go out, you have a couple of drinks. You're
[3:55:07.820 --> 3:55:14.140]  going home 11 o'clock at night, 12 o'clock at night. The dick detectives are out on
[3:55:14.140 --> 3:55:19.580]  the streets. You didn't have your tail light on your tail lights off. Where were you? How
[3:55:19.580 --> 3:55:27.060]  many drinks did you have? Get out of the car, stand on your head, repeat the alphabet backward.
[3:55:27.060 --> 3:55:34.580]  You commit a minor crime. Boom. They bring in a SWAT team. They're all down on us, man.
[3:55:34.580 --> 3:55:43.020]  But screw the people out of billions of billions of dollars. And we give them a two bit fine.
[3:55:43.020 --> 3:55:48.860]  It adds up to nothing. So that's what you do when you forecast trends. You put the
[3:55:48.860 --> 3:55:59.900]  pieces together. I bring that up because it's all tied together. Sanders has a shot. A lot's
[3:55:59.900 --> 3:56:13.380]  going to depend on the economy. And with this coronavirus and things get worse and the global
[3:56:13.380 --> 3:56:19.660]  economy is already in trouble. Matter of fact, today, the IMF, the International Monetary
[3:56:19.660 --> 3:56:31.180]  Fund came out with another report warning about the large corporate debt levels. Yeah.
[3:56:31.180 --> 3:56:38.660]  But although we heard from three Federal Reserve presidents last week, that's indicating they're
[3:56:38.660 --> 3:56:46.900]  not going to raise interest rates this year. I forecast within several months interest rates
[3:56:46.900 --> 3:56:52.700]  in the United States will be at zero to negative percent. They're right around there. They don't
[3:56:52.700 --> 3:56:59.180]  have a lot of room to move. When their last recession hit 2007, interest rates came down
[3:56:59.180 --> 3:57:07.580]  from 5%. Now the overnight's 1.5. Will it be enough to change things? Nope. The worst times
[3:57:07.580 --> 3:57:17.020]  are ahead. The greatest depression. My forecast is 2021. But if things keep getting worse,
[3:57:17.020 --> 3:57:22.300]  maybe sooner rather than later. And again, I want to thank everyone for tuning in today
[3:57:22.300 --> 3:57:27.620]  and remember, support Infowars. Do what you can to keep the truth alive. And if you want
[3:57:27.620 --> 3:57:33.500]  to read history before it happens, see the future in Trends Journal. We'll help you get
[3:57:33.500 --> 3:57:39.980]  there and prepare for a future. All the best. Stay healthy, safe, keeping that high spirit.
[3:57:39.980 --> 3:58:04.980]  See ya.
