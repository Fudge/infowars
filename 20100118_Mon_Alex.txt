[03:42.640 --> 03:46.920]  into the Sunday show that's why callers are so important they alert us to this
[03:46.920 --> 03:52.160]  and said that he tried to go to the gun show and of course it's legal and lawful
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.760]  for individuals to go meet at the gun show to rent their own table they want
[03:57.760 --> 04:02.320]  to sell a few guns and to get rid of them the federal law says that if you're
[04:02.320 --> 04:09.240]  engaged in you know continual commerce of guns that is you have a gun shop or
[04:09.240 --> 04:13.360]  that's your main business that you have to get the federal firearms license to
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.760]  sell it's a tax issue it's a color of law issue and they want to set the
[04:17.760 --> 04:23.760]  precedent nationwide that you can't buy your son a rifle that your the
[04:23.760 --> 04:29.120]  grandfather can't buy his grandson or daughter a 22 and I've seen countless
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.840]  cases where they arrest people for selling their neighbor a gun when it's
[04:33.840 --> 04:40.760]  legal and lawful well the APD the Austin Police Department and the BATF on record

[07:10.480 --> 07:14.800]  birthdays and vacations in order to store all the food possible even those
[07:14.800 --> 07:19.120]  who've sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food even those who have

[07:38.400 --> 07:42.960]  deeply regret that we didn't get enough food putting off emergency food
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.160]  preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make
[07:47.160 --> 07:59.480]  call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[07:59.480 --> 08:08.920]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:16.320 --> 08:24.760]  all over the United States in the last decade I have seen reports in
[08:24.760 --> 08:32.560]  newspapers on television of cities and counties trying to tell gun shows that
[08:32.560 --> 08:37.520]  they can't have private sellers somebody wants to sell their shotgun go
[08:37.520 --> 08:42.200]  rent a table go to the gun show and sell it to a private citizen craigslist
[08:42.200 --> 08:46.040]  doesn't let you advertise private sales citizen to citizen like if you're
[08:46.040 --> 08:54.600]  selling a jet ski or a golf club set or a BB gun or a water hose you can sell
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.920]  all of that but you can't sell firearms and now craigslist and others aren't
[08:59.920 --> 09:05.720]  allowing slingshots and BB guns to be sold children are being arrested every
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.640]  week I see news reports of children playing with plastic guns toy guns and
[09:10.640 --> 09:16.840]  being arrested saying that neighbors complain that it looked threatening it
[09:16.840 --> 09:24.080]  is a religion of bondage and disarmament and demonization of the
[09:24.080 --> 09:29.040]  second amendment where they want to basically create the illusion and the
[09:29.040 --> 09:34.200]  public perception that firearms are illegal you know about billboards all
[09:34.200 --> 09:38.360]  over the country for more than a decade that show an image of a revolver and it
[09:38.360 --> 09:43.960]  says report illegal guns and then you read the fine print at the bottom of the
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.080]  billboard that's very hard to read even up close and it says oh you get the
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.080]  reward for illegal guns guns used in the commission of a crime but the
[09:53.080 --> 09:59.560]  illusion is guns are illegal and that illusion that fraud can't be pushed if
[09:59.560 --> 10:03.920]  you've got almost every state in the union still has the Constitution in
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.200]  place where you can sell your neighbor a shotgun a rifle you can sell your
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.920]  cousin a shotgun a rifle or handgun and you can put an ad in the paper but most
[10:13.920 --> 10:21.400]  papers won't take the ads now to say hey I've got a Mossberg shotgun I'm
[10:21.400 --> 10:27.720]  selling I've got a Smith and Wesson 357 Magnum I'm selling or I've got ammo I'm
[10:27.720 --> 10:34.080]  selling all over the country stores there's no law the BATF just comes in
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.320]  and orders them and says we're going to shut you down and they sit there like
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.200]  crooks and threaten them if you don't start getting people's drivers license
[10:42.200 --> 10:49.640]  and name when they buy ammo and this prepares you for it to become law just
[10:49.640 --> 10:54.200]  like more than a decade ago the feds in the state would come in and tell drug
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.520]  stores we want you to get the names of people buying suit of fed or buying
[10:58.520 --> 11:03.160]  claretin because sometimes criminals get it and make methamphetamine out of it
[11:03.160 --> 11:08.520]  so because somebody might do something wrong you all have to be color of law
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.320]  registered then after that goes on for a few years states like Texas and
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.280]  California and others under federal grants pass laws where you have to
[11:18.280 --> 11:23.400]  register to buy the over-the-counter medicines a couple months out of the
[11:23.400 --> 11:27.560]  year I get Cedar fever like most people in Austin and I try to go in and buy
[11:27.560 --> 11:30.960]  claretin or suit of fed I've got to give them my driver's license and have them
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.160]  record it and register it and I see old people buying beer buying cigarettes
[11:36.160 --> 11:41.520]  buying tobacco I've been into Walgreens and seen literally an 85 year old man or
[11:41.520 --> 11:47.560]  older on a cane with a cane walker showing his driver's license to buy a
[11:47.560 --> 11:54.960]  pipe tobacco this is all about a part of training you to show ID to buy and sell
[11:54.960 --> 12:00.240]  getting you ready for the national and global carbon tax slash sales tax which
[12:00.240 --> 12:06.360]  they're now openly announcing so this is a very sophisticated complex issue and
[12:06.360 --> 12:12.560]  in the next hour I'm going to simulcast at prisonplanet.tv so we can
[12:12.560 --> 12:18.600]  actually show you all of these documents and laws and reports so there's no
[12:18.600 --> 12:26.440]  denial now the issue I'm going to cover now ladies and gentlemen is off the
[12:26.440 --> 12:33.600]  charts in its magnitude because previously in Colorado and California in
[12:33.600 --> 12:42.480]  Utah in Indiana we've seen the reports everywhere in Michigan in Oklahoma in
[12:42.480 --> 12:46.360]  towns all over this great nation
[12:46.360 --> 12:55.920]  cities pass ordinances counties pass ordinances saying you can no longer have
[12:55.920 --> 13:05.960]  private sales of firearms without having a BATF license at gun shows and some
[13:05.960 --> 13:10.840]  cities pass laws saying you can't sell your neighbor a gun you can't buy your
[13:10.840 --> 13:18.880]  son a gun any firearm transfer or sale must be registered now second
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.960]  amendment organizations grassroots organizations have fought in every
[13:23.960 --> 13:32.480]  state to defeat unconstitutional local ordinances because if a city or county
[13:32.480 --> 13:39.040]  law does not cite its power for a law from the state constitution or state
[13:39.040 --> 13:45.840]  laws it is illegal it is tyranny and the reason you have that is they've had
[13:45.840 --> 13:50.120]  many towns and cities throughout history that get a corrupt boss hog in power
[13:50.120 --> 13:54.080]  who literally just start taking people's property because they want it and
[13:54.080 --> 13:58.480]  giving it to their friends or family who start taking people's guns who start
[13:58.480 --> 14:06.640]  taking people's crops and so the state has to come in and stop it now normally
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.320]  cities pass a law even though they're fraudulent and have to be overturned via
[14:11.320 --> 14:17.200]  lawsuits or actions by the state attorney generals they don't do that in
[14:17.200 --> 14:26.920]  Austin Texas I have never seen anything like this this is absolute bona fide the
[14:26.920 --> 14:37.000]  real deal super ultra illegal tyranny when the government just shows up and
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.560]  doesn't cite a law or statute or even regulation and just says you're not
[14:43.560 --> 14:48.680]  gonna sell guns here anymore and puts a notice up on the door and has cops stand
[14:48.680 --> 14:56.600]  there handing out flyers to everyone and we have the actual flyer from the Texas
[14:56.600 --> 15:02.120]  gun show formerly the Saxon gun show but now they left Austin and we have a
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.240]  group called the Texas gun show and they're against what's happening they
[15:05.240 --> 15:09.440]  had a table there with women from the Texas gun show saying please sign a
[15:09.440 --> 15:16.160]  petition to the Texas Attorney General because this is illegal the BATF showed
[15:16.160 --> 15:20.920]  up here and the Austin police showed up backing them up giving them jurisdiction
[15:20.920 --> 15:31.000]  and told them I'm boss hog you're not gonna do this this is the heart the root
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.880]  of tyranny when government says we don't have a law it's against the law but
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.920]  we're gonna warrantlessly wiretap you we're gonna use the Patriot Act per
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.640]  state thousands of times a year in non-terror related cases that makes
[15:46.640 --> 15:50.680]  the Constitution null and void that's tyranny but at least they've got a phony
[15:50.680 --> 15:57.280]  baloney Patriot Act at least they've got some fake law in the process of being
[15:57.280 --> 16:01.000]  overturned all across the nation at least they claim they've got a piece of
[16:01.000 --> 16:08.080]  paper at least they at least they swear out some type of fake baloney not in
[16:08.080 --> 16:15.000]  Austin Texas this is unprecedented public notice this was given out Friday
[16:15.000 --> 16:23.280]  Saturday and Sunday in Austin Texas public notice just a public notice
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.040]  they're setting up precedent here they're just announcing their new power
[16:28.040 --> 16:33.360]  selling of firearms in quotes at the direction of the Austin Police Department
[16:33.360 --> 16:39.960]  at the direction they direct and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms
[16:39.960 --> 16:46.680]  anyone selling a firearm at this show location will be asked to comply asked
[16:46.680 --> 16:52.120]  notice it's all color of law to comply with the following and now they bring
[16:52.120 --> 16:56.160]  in the true criminal color of law because of one word this is completely
[16:56.160 --> 17:00.440]  illegal now it's clearly constitutional violation color of law fraud in the
[17:00.440 --> 17:05.720]  first paragraph where they're just there telling you through pure color of law
[17:05.720 --> 17:11.880]  we're asking you to do this but we're the police with the implied authority now
[17:11.880 --> 17:16.800]  here's what's illegal the previous paragraph is clearly unconstitutional
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.640]  and illegal but this is 100% illegal number one any person selling a personal
[17:22.640 --> 17:32.400]  firearm must must you are commanded must go through a licensed FFL dealer in the

[22:17.160 --> 22:21.440]  you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus

[24:11.560 --> 24:15.400]  no second amendment and they're gonna ban guns and free speech and take over
[24:15.400 --> 24:20.640]  the internet it's all over mainstream news saying how wonderful it is all over
[24:20.640 --> 24:26.040]  the country the BATF tripled in size now the BATFE Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco
[24:26.040 --> 24:31.440]  Firearms and Explosives is setting up surveillance systems harassing people at
[24:31.440 --> 24:37.840]  gun shows legally selling each other firearms as private citizens but now in
[24:37.840 --> 24:42.040]  Austin Texas public notice selling of firearms at the direction of the Austin
[24:42.040 --> 24:45.480]  Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms anyone
[24:45.480 --> 24:49.200]  selling a firearm at this show location will be asked to comply with the
[24:49.200 --> 24:54.360]  following one you will be asked see it's all color of law there's no law
[24:54.360 --> 24:59.840]  behind this any person and that's illegal any person selling a personal
[24:59.840 --> 25:08.160]  firearm must must go through a licensed FFL dealer in the show to transfer a
[25:08.160 --> 25:12.600]  firearm to the new owner to selling of firearms in the parking lot will not be
[25:12.600 --> 25:17.640]  permitted I'm gonna open the phones up in the next 30 minutes only for people
[25:17.640 --> 25:21.840]  that have seen this happen at their gun shows around the country and is this
[25:21.840 --> 25:27.720]  happening at other gun shows in Texas because this is outrageously illegal
[25:27.720 --> 25:32.440]  and the police just don't need to be overturned by the Texas Attorney General
[25:32.440 --> 25:38.440]  or by the legislature they need to get in trouble somebody needs to sit our a
[25:38.440 --> 25:42.880]  savada down and say listen just because the BATF comes down here just because
[25:42.880 --> 25:47.280]  you're wanting a job later in the Justice Department doesn't like several of our
[25:47.280 --> 25:52.360]  police chiefs have left to become does it mean you go just set up I mean what's
[25:52.360 --> 25:57.280]  next will they put out a notice that everyone must bring their unregistered
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.160]  guns in to be registered like they did in Canada and England before they ban
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.440]  them and the way they write these laws to overturn the gun show loophole as it's
[26:06.440 --> 26:12.600]  called imply that it's bad to imply that it's illegal when it's not is that it
[26:12.600 --> 26:16.800]  will ban all private transfers you want to give your uncle a gun he wants to give
[26:16.800 --> 26:26.520]  you a gun when I was 14 years old my dad gave me the lever action savage 243
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.800]  dear rifle that he was given when he was eight years old by his great uncle can't
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.280]  do it they also introduced a law we barely beat in 2000 in Texas that would
[26:38.280 --> 26:42.000]  have banned junior shooting sports saying no one under 18 can even touch a gun
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.040]  they want to kill our culture of self-defense and liberty slaves are
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.200]  disarmed and let me tell you what the BATF's doing they're feeding on people
[26:52.200 --> 26:57.680]  some old man needs money comes in sells two of his shotguns they bust him out in
[26:57.680 --> 27:00.080]  the parking lot and illegally charge him because it's not even what the
[27:00.080 --> 27:05.480]  statute say for federal firearms transfer for being a gun dealer when he's not a
[27:05.480 --> 27:10.320]  gun dealer he's privately selling a firearm I get reports to see reports
[27:10.320 --> 27:15.200]  every day of people pulled over even going to the gun range in Texas in
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.560]  Vermont in places that have strong second amendment and the cops are so
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.960]  brainwashed they go ahead and arrest you for the legal gun and a lot of people
[27:23.960 --> 27:32.080]  just plea bargain to non-laws I mean we live in a tyranny how many reports do
[27:32.080 --> 27:35.520]  you see in the news about neighbors see some old man it's almost always an old
[27:35.520 --> 27:39.520]  man in their garage cleaning their gun the neighbors get scared seeing a gun
[27:39.520 --> 27:45.160]  they call the police they come and it's on the news this guy John Brown John
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.880]  Doe was arrested for an arsenal he had 11 rifles two handguns and over 3,000
[27:51.880 --> 27:56.880]  rounds of ammo it's an arsenal there's no law against an arsenal or defining what
[27:56.880 --> 28:04.000]  an arsenal is just a bunch of lawless gun-hating crux now here's the deal
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.560]  they've had national surveys were over 98% back Paul Jack McClan let's get him
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.400]  on about this today too that's why canceled yesterday so we can get into
[28:14.400 --> 28:23.200]  the second amendment under attack there have been countless cases of where they
[28:23.200 --> 28:30.200]  do this and where they just teach police that guns are illegal when they're
[28:30.200 --> 28:35.200]  not but normally they pass a fake ordinance that's unconstitutional
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.120]  under the federal and state constitution this is the feds coming in and then I
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.440]  have the council of governors being set up by Obama merging it with PDD 51 open
[28:45.440 --> 28:50.080]  takeover of the states mainstream news pointing out this is total federalization
[28:50.080 --> 28:54.720]  total takeover we've got him training the Boy Scout Explorer clubs now being
[28:54.720 --> 28:59.680]  taken over from the Boy Scouts by the feds and by big police departments like
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.880]  the LAPD and then you look you read the news articles and see police photos of
[29:03.880 --> 29:08.840]  the training they're training 14 15 16 year olds to quote take on disgruntled
[29:08.840 --> 29:13.160]  vets that own guns remember the homeland security my reports or homeland
[29:13.160 --> 29:17.080]  securities internal reports say they're setting up to go after American gun
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.040]  owners and then American gun owners and especially returning vets are the
[29:21.040 --> 29:30.440]  number one threat to the government you see they can't pass laws against your
[29:30.440 --> 29:34.560]  second amendment we're beating them there and so they just do it outside the
[29:34.560 --> 29:41.440]  law but you've got 98% of police in national surveys against gun control
[29:41.440 --> 29:46.800]  there they don't like what's happening but the commanders are criminals the
[29:46.800 --> 29:54.080]  commanders are thugs it's illegal we're on the march the empires on the run

[37:26.840 --> 37:30.840]  and post it there for everybody where i really break down what's happening i got
[37:30.840 --> 37:36.680]  caught unaware live with a caller about the texas gun shows that came to
[37:36.680 --> 37:41.560]  austin and how they were just outside of the law just ordered by men in
[37:41.560 --> 37:45.480]  uniforms with guns you will not allow anyone to have private transfers of
[37:45.480 --> 37:52.600]  firearms here which is a violation of state law and we went to their website
[37:52.600 --> 37:56.280]  and they they say it on their website we got the public notice the actual
[37:56.280 --> 38:01.720]  copies being handed out it's it's at info wars dot com and i last night watch
[38:01.720 --> 38:06.600]  the video of my simulcast the radio and i i didn't even really make the key
[38:06.600 --> 38:12.480]  points i was so beside myself with frothing anger the most highly decorated
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.480]  police officer in phoenix arizona history jack mclean founder police and
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.800]  military against the new world order twenty six years ago twenty seven years
[38:19.800 --> 38:23.720]  ago he's been warning about this he'll join us in the next hour to talk about
[38:23.720 --> 38:27.720]  this some i want to go to your phone calls now
[38:27.720 --> 38:33.000]  specifically about going to gun shows and how they're getting your license
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.360]  numbers your social security numbers they're saying you're not allowed to
[38:36.360 --> 38:41.080]  have private sales of guns outside the law they're now busting people
[38:41.080 --> 38:46.360]  everywhere without even a law they just trump up other charges
[38:46.360 --> 38:52.760]  and falsely charge people for other laws for selling their neighbors guns
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.640]  they're now outside the law ordering gun shops all over the country
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.880]  started with walmart five years ago to just get your license number and scan
[39:01.880 --> 39:05.320]  your license when you buy ammo i mean i mean they're it's just
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.160]  totally illegal but to show up and say
[39:09.160 --> 39:13.480]  any person selling a personal firearm must go through a license ffl dealer
[39:13.480 --> 39:17.720]  in the show to transfer the firearm to a new owner must
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.720]  no law no code no no no local ordinance seat again
[39:23.720 --> 39:28.360]  normally they get a local ordinance passed then it gets overturned as un
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.760]  constitutional at the state level because cities can't pass laws outside the
[39:32.760 --> 39:36.600]  state constitution their cities and counties are chartered
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.760]  by the state that's how long i mean this is lawless this is the government
[39:40.760 --> 39:47.080]  so arrogant the police the apd the batf know this is illegal but
[39:47.080 --> 39:49.800]  they're confident they can just get away with it just like
[39:49.800 --> 39:53.640]  private banks could control the fed and the treasury
[39:53.640 --> 39:57.880]  and openly give themselves 200 plus billion of the trillions
[39:57.880 --> 40:02.120]  to their own personal bonuses geitner
[40:02.120 --> 40:08.280]  poulsen summers all of them giving themselves bonuses from the government
[40:08.280 --> 40:12.840]  they run totally illegal be like a bank
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.000]  manager going in and giving themselves a million dollars out of the vault
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.160]  it's illegal doesn't matter if you say you're the bank
[40:21.160 --> 40:26.600]  manager you can't do that i mean the point is they are engaged in
[40:26.600 --> 40:33.960]  open crime in front of everyone and and i'm sure that the attorney general
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.960]  will come down on them as they have before in other states and in this state
[40:37.960 --> 40:41.560]  and say you can't do that but austin doesn't care bat up doesn't care they
[40:41.560 --> 40:44.440]  don't even care what the attorney general says
[40:44.440 --> 40:48.200]  by the way who was that conservative state senator we've had on his name escapes
[40:48.200 --> 40:52.760]  me had him on last year about the gun grabbing
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.360]  i want to get him back on i want to get the pro gun state senators go to the
[40:56.360 --> 41:01.800]  texas uh rifle association go to the texas
[41:01.800 --> 41:04.520]  association we got to get them on we've got to really make a big deal out of
[41:04.520 --> 41:08.920]  this or it won't create enough of a ruckus
[41:08.920 --> 41:14.760]  i just i just can't believe this i mean
[41:14.760 --> 41:21.640]  this is an illegitimate lawless city i live in i mean two years ago they
[41:21.640 --> 41:24.440]  started taking blood at checkpoints without warrants and i pointed out this
[41:24.440 --> 41:27.400]  is illegal so they went to the legislature and the
[41:27.400 --> 41:33.320]  legislature passed a law that they can take blood without warrants
[41:33.320 --> 41:38.120]  the police now that's unconstitutional at the federal level and
[41:38.120 --> 41:40.680]  that's the supreme court it looks like it's going to strike it down
[41:40.680 --> 41:43.960]  but the point is they're trying all this illegalness but this isn't even the
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.000]  legislature passing an unconstitutional act
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.840]  then it's just unconstitutional this is the city of austin
[41:50.840 --> 41:55.960]  and r.a. suveda under the federal control of the batf e
[41:55.960 --> 42:00.280]  announcing that they can do whatever they want
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.360]  you know i like kurt nemo's headline but we need to make the point in here
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.280]  editors note kurt that this is clearly illegal this is not under the state
[42:10.280 --> 42:13.720]  constitution this is not under a state law the city is
[42:13.720 --> 42:17.080]  operating illegally
[42:17.560 --> 42:24.120]  the batf isn't here engaged in high treason the feds are in my town
[42:24.120 --> 42:31.000]  with no law no statute no power and the good news is the gun show was there
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.520]  getting people to sign a petition i'm working on getting them on
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.640]  getting locals to sign petitions to go to the attorney general to stop
[42:39.640 --> 42:44.440]  austin and the feds from just showing up i mean if they can get away with this
[42:44.440 --> 42:47.960]  they get with anything remember the kilo uh the kilo
[42:47.960 --> 42:51.880]  connecticut the kilo new london connecticut
[42:51.880 --> 42:56.680]  decision of five years ago where they said we can take your property
[42:56.680 --> 43:01.320]  without just compensation that was in the supreme court ruling
[43:01.320 --> 43:04.040]  and it even said in the ruling right on air many times
[43:04.040 --> 43:07.640]  we spent months on it fighting it then in the aftermath
[43:07.640 --> 43:11.880]  saying private interests can give money it's not bribery now
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.440]  to local city county or state governments to take your property
[43:16.440 --> 43:21.080]  without payment in fact i interviewed the families
[43:21.080 --> 43:25.240]  who lived in two three four generation beautiful victorian style homes on the
[43:25.240 --> 43:31.480]  water houses valued at 600 000 a million 100 000
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.520]  they didn't just not get payment they told them two years before they took it
[43:34.520 --> 43:39.080]  if you fight this in court we're going to come back with attorneys fees from the
[43:39.080 --> 43:43.400]  state and the city and charge you and so one family had their 600
[43:43.400 --> 43:47.240]  thousand dollar house bulldozed and got a 300 plus thousand dollar bill
[43:47.240 --> 43:52.840]  from the lawyers so you don't just get your land taken you pay to have it taken
[43:52.840 --> 43:57.160]  you pay to be a slave you pay to be raped
[43:57.160 --> 44:03.560]  property rights folks my father who's a landowner
[44:03.560 --> 44:07.560]  owns a large tract of land in east texas a redditary land
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.720]  he got a notice right after new london kilo decision
[44:11.720 --> 44:14.600]  three years ago two years after the decision
[44:14.600 --> 44:18.200]  saying here's your new texas landowner bill of rights
[44:18.200 --> 44:20.760]  kind of like the new freedom initiative federally takes your freedom
[44:20.760 --> 44:25.320]  it's our welly in name or the patriot act is unpatriotic it said you have no
[44:25.320 --> 44:28.280]  property rights if we say we're taking your land or
[44:28.280 --> 44:33.880]  putting a pipeline across it or if you turn down a mineral offer
[44:33.880 --> 44:38.600]  you are given three months to accept the first offer you're given if it's 10
[44:38.600 --> 44:41.400]  cents on the dollar and then we just take it and charge you
[44:41.400 --> 44:43.960]  attorney fees
[44:44.760 --> 44:49.800]  that's america they're not just going to take your guns for all you stupid
[44:49.800 --> 44:53.640]  mainline domesticated cowardly liberals that are afraid of seeing a fellow

[44:57.000 --> 45:01.880]  citizen with a gun but not cops you are going to lose everything you got

[47:17.800 --> 47:21.560]  people that are private sales again if you sell a bunch of guns they bust you
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.080]  and say it's the federal statute that you gotta have a federal farms license to
[47:25.080 --> 47:28.120]  do it as a business it's a tax that's how they got the
[47:28.120 --> 47:32.680]  unconstitutional issue in but private sales you still have the right to say
[47:32.680 --> 47:34.840]  sell your neighbor a gun or have them sell you a gun
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.320]  so you find somebody that wants to sell you a private sale

[56:11.160 --> 56:13.720]  we're going to have to get together we're going to have to start screaming
[56:13.720 --> 56:17.080]  loud the the the press after this because we don't like to say we're all
[56:17.080 --> 56:21.000]  done for let's talk to spencer and texas spencer
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.400]  go ahead you're on the air hey thanks uh good show alec
[56:25.400 --> 56:29.000]  yeah i got a quick story for you um my brother is a
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.160]  police officer in south texas and uh a couple months ago
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.320]  got a knock at the front door and it was a couple of atf agents
[56:37.320 --> 56:41.000]  going door to door without any kind of warrant or anything
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.440]  yeah it's called knock and talk nationwide going on for at least seven
[56:44.440 --> 56:47.800]  years they come to your door and say do you mind if we look at your guns i mean
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.640]  folks what happened yeah police and he's a
[56:51.640 --> 56:56.520]  police officer you know it's ridiculous and so what
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.960]  happened well uh he refused to talk to him and he
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.240]  told him if uh they came back he'd have him arrested for trespassing and they
[57:03.240 --> 57:06.840]  left and a couple of weeks went by and this
[57:06.840 --> 57:10.440]  happened all over this town he's in a couple of weeks went by and he actually
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.320]  ran into one of those atf agents and asked you said man what in the world
[57:15.320 --> 57:18.600]  is going on why are you guys doing this and he he said well you know we know
[57:18.600 --> 57:21.240]  what the bs and we know it's unconstitutional but we've got to do
[57:21.240 --> 57:25.160]  what we got to do because our it's the current administration
[57:25.160 --> 57:31.800]  yes again even the batf knows this is illegal it's illegal
[57:31.800 --> 57:35.640]  that's criminal i mean they are criminal when they do this
[57:35.640 --> 57:40.280]  austin police don't do something illegal don't i mean it's like hitler telling
[57:40.280 --> 57:42.840]  his people to do illegal stuff just because he's hitler
[57:42.840 --> 57:46.200]  just because he's the leader doesn't mean he's god
[57:46.200 --> 57:49.480]  but so the old agents don't get carried through with it and they get written
[57:49.480 --> 57:52.520]  up or you know possibly you know terminated well you know what they
[57:52.520 --> 57:55.320]  better say no because it's going to get a lot worse if they don't

[57:59.560 --> 58:02.360]  texas uh i i really don't want to tell it because
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.680]  or say because i need you know it's kind of widespread down there

[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:11.000]  they were sending their wives out there and kids with the guns they didn't even
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.480]  want to come out the house to bring them their self
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:17.000]  and and and the police now is making them and come out

[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:24.360]  we either got a second it was on abc news they would go in high and dry even
[1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:28.840]  wealthy people's homes meaning nobody's safe and slam them on the ground in
[1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:32.600]  handcuffs while they took their guns it wasn't enough to just take them and
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:35.800]  then steal them and never give them back illegally
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:39.320]  yeah scrap throwing them in a boat and just scratching them all up and all that
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:42.840]  but alex it listen what we're gonna do
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:46.920]  without a gun what would you do without a gun it's so bad you can't even hold it
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:50.360]  go to the mailbox appear that's how bad it is and we got
[1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:53.480]  shooting every day two three shootings every day
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:56.920]  and and and now bomber he wants to take out guns but he wants us to pay for
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:00.440]  his bodyguards meanwhile they they're collapsing the
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:04.360]  society by design like Haiti and they know it's causing more crime they
[1:03:04.360 --> 1:03:07.800]  know people are defending themselves and they want us to live like they do in
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:12.120]  chicago and in new york i mean obama argued a state
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:16.840]  senator for complete gun ban uh yes i remember you saying that yes but i've
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:20.040]  been watching on jessie ventura you've been i just want to say right
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:23.160]  me you know i really love that show and people need to tell other people about
[1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:26.680]  it and people never tell everybody about your show
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:29.960]  and and you know i hate to come up with the tapes again but right now would be a
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:35.640]  good time to start putting the tapes out i mean people are hungry for the truth
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:39.000]  and some people are just scared to talk about it but they'll watch the tape and
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.200]  some people won't watch the tape but we got to get the word out
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:46.440]  alex and not only that we got it we got it we got to say no to this we just
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:51.240]  got to say no that's all we have to do they'll back off
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:54.680]  well i mean this is completely illegal they just show up with no law and say
[1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:57.480]  we're shutting the gun showdown shutting private sales down
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:01.400]  they don't care they don't care if it's illegal or not there's nothing
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:06.280]  uh uh uh it constitutional and what it sheds us up they just take it out of
[1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:08.840]  money and the people ain't doing nothing about it
[1:04:08.840 --> 1:04:12.440]  that they keep calling it but we've got to say no every state
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:16.120]  go to go to the capital and say we ain't giving our guns up do what you want to
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.520]  do now we can't we can't keep running from it alex
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:24.760]  everyone needs to call in their state their state senators and legislators
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:28.200]  and get them on this believe me austin's going to get in trouble for this
[1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:31.880]  and they're going to probably be forced to back off but it needs to be more they
[1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:35.960]  need to get in trouble i mean this is illegal just because you're wearing a
[1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:38.920]  uniform and got a gun on your side doesn't make you god
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:44.120]  where you can just make any law you want charles good to hear from you
[1:04:44.120 --> 1:04:47.240]  and folks the government has to reapply its lies every day

[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.360]  country literally hundreds of times cities and counties
[1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:36.920]  have passed unconstitutional laws saying you can't sell your neighbor a gun or go
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:40.760]  to a gun show and have a private sale they've all been overturned
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:44.760]  the state legislature has had to pass laws against this type of behavior
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:48.280]  they didn't even pass a city ordinance they're just doing this
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:51.480]  they don't even have an unconstitutional regulation or ordinance
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:56.200]  they just did this and the gun show we're going to get on the broadcast
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:59.480]  is asking people to sign a petition to the texas attorney general
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:04.040]  to stop this but we've confirmed this is going on nationwide and batf
[1:15:04.040 --> 1:15:09.160]  e federally and local police all over the country are knocking on doors saying
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:13.160]  we want to come in and inspect your guns and trying to force their way in
[1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:17.160]  without warrants without even probable cause they're going house to house
[1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:21.240]  remember new orleans all the guns will be taken no one be allowed to be armed
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:24.920]  they went to high and dry areas went into women men hand cuffed them and took
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:28.760]  their guns even if they didn't resist and never gave them back
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:32.680]  this is absolute lawless criminal treason
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:37.400]  by the city of austin and by the bat fe it's totally illegal you heard the guy
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:40.840]  whose brother's a police officer where the bat fe came to his door
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:43.800]  and they said look we know it's bull we're being ordered to do this we know
[1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:46.840]  it's unconstitutional well you better say no
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:51.080]  you better not follow unlawful orders and for 25 plus years officer jack
[1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:54.280]  mclan vietnam vet most highly decorated police
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.640]  officer cop of the year twice in phoenix woke up to this
[1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:00.440]  became the most fired he's with us for the rest of the hour
[1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:03.560]  and we're going to open the phones up specifically
[1:16:03.560 --> 1:16:07.880]  on issues we have roya in texas first who was at the show we're coming to him
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:11.880]  and then after we take these five calls on hold the lines are open to police
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:15.880]  officers whose side are you on the bill of rights the constitution the people
[1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:20.360]  are this illegal government telling you to violate the law jack mclan is
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:24.280]  as a police officer i know the law but you're a police officer as a police
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.760]  officer can you break down exactly how illegal this
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:32.200]  is and how outrageous this is yes sir
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:36.520]  alec thank you for having me on this is insane
[1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:43.640]  and totally tyrannical uh i'm looking at the
[1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:48.520]  supreme court cases marbury versus madison that says all laws which are
[1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:53.320]  repugnant to the constitution are null and void
[1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:57.160]  and where rights secured by the constitution are involved there can be
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:00.440]  no rulemaking or legislation which would
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:06.680]  abrogate the constitutional rule but this isn't even a law jack this is just
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:10.120]  the government's god that's what i'm saying this is totally
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:15.960]  unconstitutional and uh when they go into the gun shows to arrest somebody
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:19.640]  for doing this i would like to see everybody in the gun
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:23.000]  show grab those police officers and atf
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:28.040]  officers and arrest them under a citizen's arrest for tyranny
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:31.800]  because that's exactly what they're committing and that's what
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:36.120]  ought to be done the people ought to grab them and put their own cuffs on them
[1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:42.840]  and hold them for prosecution uh but now you know when i was in phoenix
[1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:47.560]  arizona as a cop me and the other cops saw the
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:53.160]  most criminal prosecutors i mean literal criminal prosecutors that would
[1:17:53.160 --> 1:17:58.200]  destroy evidence manufacture evidence and uh pay
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:02.040]  witnesses to get on the witness stand and lie through their teeth
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:06.840]  they would pay them big money they're the only ones that got
[1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:11.000]  promoted up to judgeships in arizona
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.240]  and uh around the country the same thing happened because the criminals at the
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:20.520]  top the uh terrorist and the
[1:18:20.520 --> 1:18:24.280]  treasonous scumbags at the top of our system

[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:34.200]  they did it the curtain imo story is key we got to get all the national and
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:37.880]  local gun groups involved because i'm confirmed that
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:42.120]  cities are doing this with fake regulations that get overturned this
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:46.920]  isn't even that they don't even cite it they just show up and say you must
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:50.440]  but at the end and at the front they say
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:55.320]  we are asking you you are being asked to comply thank you for cooperation but
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:24:59.000]  they say must in there uh jack i've had a lot of
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:02.680]  constitutional scholars on larry bcraft ron paul countless others but i'm
[1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:05.240]  asking you as a peace officer and one of the leading
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:08.760]  experts in this am i right this is a violation of civil rights
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:12.760]  constitution official oppression intimidation
[1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:17.720]  racketeering that this is being done through pure color of law
[1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:22.120]  i mean there's so many things that this is illegal on it sure is brother it's
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:27.480]  totally unconstitutional and i looked up supreme court cases
[1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:32.200]  norton versus shelby county that says an unconstitutional act
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:37.480]  now that's not a law it's not law it confers no rights it poses no
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:43.000]  duties afford no protection uh so this is an unconstitutional
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:47.400]  act that they're trying to enforce there and it is totally
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:53.400]  illegal and unconstitutional and they ought to be arrested for it now
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:57.320]  alex you know they ought to be arrested citizens arrest
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:04.120]  on these people because a citizen can arrest uh when he sees or she sees
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:10.760]  a a felony committed in their presence and there are thousands of federal
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:16.680]  gun show to arrest somebody under this then they are committing a felony in
[1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:20.680]  the presence of the people there and the people have a right to do a
[1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:24.600]  citizen's arrest on these guys and put them in their own handcuffs
[1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:29.560]  and hold them until the police gets there but that's what they're doing is out in
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:32.520]  the open we have thousands of state and federal rulings
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:37.640]  about cases with police if a cop's raping somebody or robbing somebody
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:42.280]  uh you know it is a citizen's arrest and and this is because the citizens
[1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:45.320]  constitute the state that then charters the cities
[1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:48.920]  they work for us that's how you can that's how you can arrest somebody
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:52.600]  that you catch robin your car that's right we are the sovereign
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:58.280]  in this land and they work for us and they can't do things uh
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:01.720]  i like thomas jefferson's quote no free man shall
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:06.440]  ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for the people to
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:10.760]  retain their right to keep in their arms is as a last resort
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.440]  to protect themselves from tyranny in their own government
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:17.640]  and that's exactly what's going on right now brother
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:20.280]  let me stop you there in our own government let me stop you there i want
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:24.120]  to go more over the history with you as our expert on this but let's go to roi
[1:27:24.120 --> 1:27:27.640]  who was at the texas gun show here in austin texas
[1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:31.080]  roi what did you witness uh yes sir can you hear me alex
[1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:34.440]  yes i can uh yes uh i've got another little
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:37.880]  uh kid another little tidbit of information that i found out i had to
[1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:41.960]  leave the show at about two o'clock and i when i and then i had to come back up
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:45.800]  there at about five to meet someone and what i found out
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:51.480]  what i missed is that uh they actually uh led led one of the vendors out who
[1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:54.600]  i've known for a long time they let him out in handcuffs
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:58.520]  after he apparently sold a firearm to an illegal alien
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:02.440]  so i'm not sure if they're saying using illegal aliens without ids to set up
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:05.560]  some of these they're definitely doing stings that was my next point i meant to
[1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:09.560]  make last hour was that they're setting people up
[1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:13.240]  they're trying to set the precedent and a chilling effect so people
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.960]  don't exercise their right to have private sales so someone refused to follow
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:21.640]  their illegal order and so they set him up
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:25.320]  yes sir and what i found out also is that they confiscated some of his
[1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:29.720]  everything he had brought to the show again i did not witness this but it's
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:32.520]  from a very credible all right let me stop you start at the beginning
[1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:36.040]  recap how they were giving out the notices what you saw
[1:28:36.040 --> 1:28:40.360]  the petition against it what was going on in austin well uh
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:43.880]  a friend of mine uh it would come from out of town who met me at the show he
[1:28:43.880 --> 1:28:46.040]  called me at eight o'clock in the morning and asked me hey are they still
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:48.520]  having the show because it looked it appeared dead
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:51.720]  i said well let me check i got on the website and there is where i first
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:54.840]  initially saw the notice uh the notice on their website
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:59.320]  that you posted and apparently that was uh posted Thursday or Friday evening so
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:02.920]  it caught everyone off guard and yes they were handing out those flyers at the
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:06.680]  door and every vendor had one of those flyers
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:12.120]  posted near their items for sale you let everyone know and then and and i was
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:16.520]  also informed that uh anyone walking around with a firearm it's from his
[1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:19.800]  personal collection if he was to sell to someone else walking around that they
[1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:24.440]  had to go over to a ffl dealer in order to complete the transaction and have a
[1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:28.760]  so it's basically having the third party do a background check but they didn't
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:32.600]  but they they decided no law regulation we have their notice they just said you
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:35.480]  will do this because we have guns and we're the government

[1:33:09.320 --> 1:33:13.000]  i want to be clear about something here we have
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:17.960]  the owner of the texas gun show that's the name of the gun show

[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:30.760]  to the state that this is illegal they were ordered by men with guns to do
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:34.200]  this the fed show up police show up
[1:33:34.200 --> 1:33:38.280]  it's destroyed their gun show most people left they they are not bad he said
[1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:41.400]  he's getting hundreds of mean emails hate mail
[1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:47.640]  they're not the ones doing this it's the government illegally doing this
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:51.400]  darwin bowdecker will be joining us in one hour
[1:33:51.400 --> 1:33:55.480]  and again i've got banker gate to cover i've got sunstein openly saying he's
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:58.520]  going to get our guns white house technologies are
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:01.480]  we've got them openly announcing they're taking over the web saying they're
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:05.080]  getting ready to censor it italy just started censoring the web
[1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:08.120]  yesterday that broke their government just announced it
[1:34:08.120 --> 1:34:11.480]  australia just started i mean it's really happening
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:15.480]  all right roi in texas you're still there jack mclan you heard the points
[1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:19.800]  he was making but we've now talked to the gun show owner
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:23.960]  doubly confirmed through them and and i understand you're saying citizens
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:28.440]  arrest but you know the average person fed show up with guns and
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:31.800]  and and and you know they've got more courage than most to say
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:34.280]  sign a petition and get everybody to fight it there
[1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:38.200]  because the state attorney general is the person and the legislature
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:45.560]  to come down on the a pd and the b atv b atv very true very true brother
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:49.800]  you know this is uh you know as a soldier
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:53.800]  during the vietnam war i took my constitutional hope to defend the
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:58.360]  constitution from internal enemies and foreign enemies
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.880]  and now it's being attacked by internal enemies
[1:35:01.880 --> 1:35:06.760]  at 1600 pennsylvania avenue and in that area
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:11.720]  and uh and then i took it as a police officer a constitutional oath to defend
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:15.640]  the constitution protect the people's rights and freedom
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:21.480]  and so these guys have to know they have to know they're violating their oath
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:25.880]  and so uh i say they ought to be citizens arrested
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:30.360]  you know if you have a hundred citizens that surround these guys
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:35.160]  they can't shoot them all you know and uh and
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:38.920]  they just jump on them and push them to the ground and take their guns away
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:43.320]  from them and put them in their own handcuffs and hold them until they get
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:46.920]  somebody there that will enforce the constitutional law
[1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:51.880]  now jack that's what the law says that if men in uniforms show up and say give me
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:55.320]  your daughter give me your house give me your guns i'm god
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:59.560]  and don't cite the law even if it's unconstitutional then you defeat that in
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:02.520]  the courts or by redress of grievance or petition
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:07.000]  this is just literally the fed showing up just like knock and talk
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.200]  where they started it seven eight years ago
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:13.800]  all over the country they come and knock on your door
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:16.680]  and say i'd like to come in and inspect your guns they target middle class
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.120]  areas when the husband's gone they target housewives they come in they look
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:24.520]  for something illegal no warrant total fishing expeditions door to door
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:27.880]  just set the precedent to have men come and they have gun buybacks
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:32.040]  for the news images of police taking guns back and people getting $50 gift
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.720]  certificates to create the perception that guns are illegal
[1:36:35.720 --> 1:36:38.600]  arresting people that sell their neighbor a gun when it's not even
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:41.800]  illegal to create the perception that guns are illegal
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:45.320]  billboards up everywhere saying report illegal guns showing a picture
[1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:48.760]  of a revolver when they're not illegal to create the perception
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:54.600]  that they're illegal and to now have the APD under the orders of the BATFE
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:57.480]  just show up and you know what's going on statewide that's what we're going to
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:00.040]  talk about in the next hour with the gun show
[1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:04.440]  spokesman and owner yeah i mean i mean this is so incredible
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:09.240]  we definitely need lawsuits filed we definitely
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:12.920]  need to find out who this man was that was arrested and set up
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:18.280]  uh for doing this i bet a million dollars that illegal alien they sent in
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:22.120]  to buy it from the guy as a private sale that that was a set up
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:24.760]  to try to scare everybody look people are being arrested because they couldn't
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:27.160]  arrest somebody for getting selling it to a citizen
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:30.280]  i mean this is incredible what do you think about what roi's saying do you
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:33.960]  want to question roi who was an eyewitness uh to the signs and
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:36.760]  them being told they couldn't have private sales of guns
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:42.440]  that they must do this with no law that's a quote you must because we say so
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:47.080]  well um i think roi understands that this is totally
[1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:51.560]  uh unlawful what they're doing it's tyrannical
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:56.520]  and um and it's unconstitutional they're violating their oath
[1:37:56.520 --> 1:38:00.680]  so i think roi already knows that and i don't know
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:05.240]  if i have any questions for roi i think he's already answered your questions
[1:38:05.240 --> 1:38:12.520]  very well but uh i just think it's time brother for the people to rise up
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.720]  like psalms 94 16 says god says for us to rise up against the
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:21.160]  evildoers and stand up against the workers of iniquity
[1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:24.840]  and the founding fathers were not ambiguous
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:30.520]  when they talked around about the people having the right to keep and bear arms
[1:38:30.520 --> 1:38:34.600]  the people now that we have the government saying no no that was for
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:38.280]  the national guard and that's for the army and for the police
[1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:43.800]  well it is not true folks patrick henry said the great object is that every man
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:47.160]  be armed everyone who is able may have a gun
[1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:52.040]  james madison said americans never need to fear their government because of the
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:57.240]  advantage of being armed and on and on thomas jefferson
[1:38:57.240 --> 1:39:01.640]  sam adam said that the fed constitution shall never be construed to
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:06.200]  override congress to prevent the people of the united states from keeping their
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:10.120]  own arms and so they were not ambiguous at all
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:16.360]  and so these liars and scumbags that are judges and prosecutors and and uh
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:21.000]  attorney generals and the president of the united states the phony president of
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:26.360]  the united states barack opomination are lying to the people when they say
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:31.480]  that they can take these guns because it was meant for the national guard only
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:35.640]  and not for the people all they have to do is read history
[1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:39.560]  and the founding fathers were not ambiguous about it at all the second
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:43.720]  amendment is for the people themselves
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:51.720]  oh it's just incredible uh anything else roi uh yes sir one thing
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:55.560]  that uh i find strange about this possibly being a setup with the illegal
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:59.800]  alien is that if this exact same show one month ago
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:02.680]  i had brought a rifle out of my personal collection that i thought about
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:06.840]  possibly selling and i was approached by someone who asked me
[1:40:06.840 --> 1:40:10.840]  hey how many is that for sale and how many do you have and then they told me
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:14.280]  i will i have a cousin in mexico that will buy all of them and right then and
[1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.840]  there i walked away because you see this was last month at the exact same show
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:22.280]  and that's what makes this occurrence that just happened this saturday
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:25.800]  oh even a more possible set up selica stillo
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  former um former uh federal law enforcement member of the dea
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:37.320]  he exposed it in south texas they've got hidden cameras in the ceilings
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:40.280]  they're trying to set everybody up treat everybody like criminals busting
[1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:45.080]  innocent people and they went and set him up on a gun deal and laughed at him
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:48.680]  uh so this is very serious roi i appreciate your call i want to open the
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:40:51.880]  phones up to police officers around the country that are
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:54.920]  outraged by this i know i have a lot of listeners that are police
[1:40:54.920 --> 1:40:57.880]  a lot of you that are constitutionalists you send me a lot of key documents that
[1:40:57.880 --> 1:41:02.200]  have made national news i mean this is illegal what's going on
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:05.240]  and i want you guys to also get me curtain immo on the line i want to talk
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:08.840]  to him live he did a great job writing this article quickly this morning but i
[1:41:08.840 --> 1:41:12.680]  want to add some key points to this article i wanted to beef this article
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:16.520]  that's going to be huge i want everyone to get this article right now this is
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:20.440]  breaking here nationwide and we've got to let gun owners know
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:23.960]  that we're one second to midnight if the feds are ready to come in without even
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:28.200]  local laws or federal laws and just say you can't sell guns at gun shows
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:32.520]  private sale when there's no law against it i mean this is an
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:36.200]  jack mclean why do you think they're coming out so bold and so arrogant right
[1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:39.880]  now well we're coming under a communist system
[1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:46.200]  folks obama nation appointed 32 communist zionists
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:51.400]  as zars over america so he could go around the congress and the supreme
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:57.400]  or the senate and the zars are all communist zionists
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:02.200]  and he's a communist himself and he's got to get these guns away from the
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:05.080]  american people so they can put us under this
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:09.160]  military rule system that he's got ready to put us under
[1:42:09.160 --> 1:42:13.160]  uh... when uh... communist uh...
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:18.120]  kyrtov was head of the homeland insecurity
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:22.760]  he hired the two top communists right under him in the world
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:26.200]  mass murdering communist uh... marcus wolf
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:29.880]  head of the east german stasi communist stasi
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:35.560]  and you've got any prima claus head of the kgb right under him to set up the
[1:42:35.560 --> 1:42:40.120]  soviet style totalitarian military rule system because he didn't know how to do
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:40.920]  it
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:44.840]  and they've got it all set up today ready to implement
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:48.840]  but they're worried about people having guns so they want to make the guns
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:52.600]  illegal even though it's totally unconstitutional
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:57.320]  and let me stop you let me stop you they're using classic military tactics
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:01.480]  where they introduced the legislation outside of legislation they do it
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:05.400]  by regulatory fiat illegally unconstitutionally right
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:11.960]  and now i hadn't even gotten to this this is the executive order january 11th
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:15.880]  creating a council of governors under pdd
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:19.400]  51 with bush you see some seamless integration
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:22.360]  uh... with the different governments of different executive uh...
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:27.000]  regimes and it says here that the ten governors appointed by him
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.280]  will speak for the states during emergencies
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:35.240]  and in section a it says homeland defense civil support synchronization
[1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:38.280]  integration of state and federal military activities
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:41.880]  in the united states it goes on to talk about law enforcement integration
[1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:45.640]  with the federal government other matters of mutual interest including
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:48.600]  national guard homeland defense civil support
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:51.960]  and it goes on to say that it's all under north com so
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:56.920]  i mean we have open declarations of a federal dictatorship and the
[1:43:56.920 --> 1:43:59.640]  russian and european news is freaking out
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.640]  saying america goes under total tyranny the average america doesn't even know
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:07.160]  this is going on i mean they're not moving incrementally
[1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:10.920]  anymore jack mclean that's right brother
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:14.840]  and we've known for years and years and years
[1:44:14.840 --> 1:44:18.760]  that an unconstitutional executive order
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:22.840]  or a presidential directive or executive agreement
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:28.280]  has no power whatsoever it's unconstitutional if you want to read
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:33.640]  about it go to the supreme court case read versus covert
[1:44:33.640 --> 1:44:39.960]  signed in 1956 and it goes ahead and states there that all of these things
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:43.400]  if they're unconstitutional they carry no weight they have
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:47.640]  they are null and void but that's laws that are unconstitutional this isn't
[1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:51.640]  even that they just announced they just announced they're doing it
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:55.160]  well it's the same thing uh i think executive order
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:44:59.000]  presidential directive executive agreement is not law either
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:05.400]  yes you're right now so if anything the htf says or local police or state
[1:45:05.400 --> 1:45:10.120]  police says that is unconstitutional is also null and void
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:14.040]  all right jack i want to i know we got pete kevin and mitch holding we're gonna
[1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:16.200]  go to them but i'm gonna open the phones up
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:20.760]  four police officers four lawyers four people that have witnessed this at gun
[1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:23.880]  shows but in fact just police officers at first or
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:26.760]  they won't be able to get through one eight hundred
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:31.880]  two five nine ninety two thirty one i know a lot of you are finally waking up
[1:45:31.880 --> 1:45:35.240]  this is totally illegal what are you going to do if you're ordered to do this
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:38.440]  or have you seen similar things or what's your take on this
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:43.640]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one
[1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:48.200]  uh let's go to pete in michigan pete you're on the air
[1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:51.240]  hey alex you can you hear me yes i can
[1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:54.920]  hey uh thank god hey i just want to tell you you're my hero man you're
[1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:59.560]  awesome i like everything you're doing and i'm driving it my girlfriend nuts
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:04.120]  listening to your show every day but uh on the topic of this uh violation of
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:08.120]  our second amendment rights i know somebody here in michigan
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:12.440]  that uh was selling guns at his garage sale him and some of his neighbors put
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:15.000]  their guns together and and was selling them in
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:18.120]  the sheriff's department threatened to arrest him because they said he couldn't
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:21.000]  do that and there's no law in michigan i've
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:24.120]  looked at the law in michigan just like texas i've seen so many cases like this
[1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:28.040]  in michigan that you can't sell your private arms you just can't
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:32.200]  start buying guns in mass and making it a business but you can get rid of guns
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:35.320]  when you need money and people need money in this economy
[1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:39.320]  and they just show up color of law and do this that's exactly what he was doing
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:43.080]  and he wasn't selling assault rifles or anything he was selling hunting guns you
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:46.680]  know shotguns and it's not even that sir
[1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:49.880]  listen all guns are basically assault weapons the way they define them anything
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:52.280]  semi-auto there's no law against that either
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:57.400]  people don't know their rights so now the police are so tyrannical in texas
[1:46:57.400 --> 1:47:00.920]  with the feds they just say we're not gonna sell them period
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:04.760]  yeah yep and uh i'll just tell you that you know there's a lot
[1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:08.520]  a lot of a lot of these people that are calling in talking to you i i've heard
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:12.360]  them say a lot of good stuff about how you know we're being violated we need to
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:15.880]  rise up and go against them but i've never heard anybody mention
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:21.080]  the law quo war ronto and i think that alex you should research that
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:25.240]  it's an old english law it's called quo war ronto
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:30.440]  and it's under the rid of mandamus and uh basically if any city say the police
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:34.920]  come and they violate your civil rights and the judge admits to it
[1:47:34.920 --> 1:47:39.000]  then that city is dissolved no longer exists that's right in the old times
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.400]  evil lord that's under magna carta did something wrong he would lose his lord
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:46.600]  ship exactly i appreciate your call p
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:49.560]  see our ancestors have been through this over and over again
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:52.200]  that's why those of us that study history know
[1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:56.360]  jack comment on that yes they sure have and i've been to it
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:01.240]  repeatedly when i took a constitutional class as a cop at phoenix
[1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:06.600]  and started upholding the constitution i was required repeatedly
[1:48:06.600 --> 1:48:11.720]  for upholding the constitution and telling my fellow officers not to do this
[1:48:11.720 --> 1:48:15.880]  and not to do that because it was unconstitutional i was fired
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:19.560]  repeatedly now they had to reharm me every time
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:24.120]  because the civil service board at phoenix said that jack has a right to
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:28.360]  uphold his oath of office and that's all i was doing
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:33.720]  and so that's that's been 25 years ago brother that i was fired repeatedly
[1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:37.640]  for upholding my oath under the constitution and telling my fellow
[1:48:37.640 --> 1:48:42.040]  officers and then you finally got medically retired
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:46.120]  yeah i was injured in the line of duty in 1986
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:50.600]  again the final time and the doctors knew that the chief of police ruben
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:55.320]  ortega was trying to get me killed because he told all the officers if
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:49:00.120]  officer mclam calls for a backup don't go to his aid
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:03.720]  and they put me down in the war zone of south phoenix
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.200]  where almost daily you needed backups and i was injured
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:12.280]  a number of times but the last time i rested a drug
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:17.560]  smuggler out of mexico and uh was seriously injured in my back
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:21.880]  shoulder and neck and so the doctors the city doctors
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:25.320]  said they were going to retire me out because they knew
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:27.960]  chief ruben ortega was trying to get me killed
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:31.400]  was taking another call for me he couldn't keep me fired
[1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:35.960]  for upholding the constitution and if more police would stand up together
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:39.720]  they could we could turn this country back uh let's right brother let's go to
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:42.760]  kevin in nebraska kevin you're on the air go ahead
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:47.640]  hi alex uh hi jack uh yeah i just wanted to say that uh
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:53.720]  really it is vital that every time that they try to push something illegal
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:56.840]  we need to contest it through the courts and through
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:01.400]  yeah they're trying to set a precedent through common law or common practice
[1:50:01.400 --> 1:50:07.240]  right yeah and too bad the people say
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:12.200]  yeah too bad the people are not the children are not taught the constitution
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:16.600]  anymore in in school and they tell them the founding
[1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:20.920]  fathers all raped their slaves in the government school system
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:25.080]  and demeaning our founding fathers so that the kids if they hear anything good
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:28.760]  about the founding fathers they will remember what the teacher told them
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:33.000]  that they all raped their slaves kevin i'm gonna i'm gonna hold you over so you
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.920]  can make your point or or go ahead and start making it
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:40.760]  uh yeah just that we we need to immediately
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:45.080]  uh initiate lawsuits and do whatever it takes in the legal realm to
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:47.800]  stop these people because if you give them ground they're just going to take
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:50.680]  more and more and more that's what they always do
[1:50:50.680 --> 1:50:55.400]  and so if we let them roll over us then uh uh you know what are we doing we're
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:50:58.920]  laying down and letting them just take more and more of our freedom away
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:01.400]  but we stay there
[1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:04.840]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:29.240]  mclam yeah i just uh wanted to say that uh i think with
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:32.520]  you know american center for law and justice and all kinds of other lawyers
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:36.360]  out there a class action lawsuit would be viable against
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:39.960]  any level of the government and any agency in the government
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:43.480]  uh that when they're doing stuff that's illegal and that's one of the ways that
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:47.400]  we need to fight this i think i appreciate your call under bush when
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:50.520]  they tripled the funding for the bat fe
[1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:53.560]  and started moving in with regulations instead of laws
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:58.520]  and just color of law we knew the storm was coming it's now here jack mclean
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:02.600]  it certainly is brother and we have that tyrannical
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:07.880]  communist in office right now that are going to use these things
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:11.800]  because they've trained for the last 30 years the citizen
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:18.280]  in in elementary school and in high school uh to not
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:22.360]  look at the constitution anymore look at international law
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.920]  is what they're teaching well jack look at new orleans first chance the feds had
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:31.080]  they blocked food and water went into the undevastated dry areas into
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:34.760]  literal 10 million dollar houses big i mean the richest area
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:38.520]  and handcuffed people and took their guns and treated them like criminals and
[1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:42.840]  never gave their guns back that's right they should have been sued by all these
[1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:46.280]  rich people all these rich people should have sued them
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:50.200]  uh and they did and the federal court said give them their guns back and
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:54.760]  damages and the feds said we're not going to give them back
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:59.400]  well they're not above the law we are the point is
[1:56:59.400 --> 1:57:04.360]  they want our guns they want our guns and we know they're training to take them
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:09.480]  and i've got mainstream news here jack la pd on course to take over
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:13.240]  explorer program and then we have the new york times
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:17.080]  with scouts train to fight terrorists and more
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:20.360]  and it says they train to take on disgruntled vets
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:24.600]  who won't turn in their guns that's right that's right they're taking the
[1:57:24.600 --> 1:57:29.160]  boy scout and the girl scout too and training them to
[1:57:29.160 --> 1:57:33.880]  use guns to take over the help of take over the nation
[1:57:33.880 --> 1:57:37.720]  and that is insane i mean it's absolutely
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:42.840]  insane but it's totally tyrannical it's the same thing happened in
[1:57:42.840 --> 1:57:47.400]  in germany during the nazi regime and in uh
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:51.080]  under Stalin under the communist system and now
[1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:56.680]  too in east germany and and by the way when you say they hired bremikov and
[1:57:56.680 --> 1:58:00.520]  wolf that was actually in the news they really hired
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:04.280]  the former head of the kgb and the former head of the stasi to come set this
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:08.040]  up and this is exactly what they've done i mean they're really doing it
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:11.880]  yeah and now we have lesbian janet the politano

[1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:29.400]  government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:32.840]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:36.280]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:38.360]  mr darwin uh borderdecker is the spokesman for the
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:44.760]  texas gun show that's the name of it we have the public notice up on info wars
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:48.920]  dot com color of law it says you must
[2:00:48.920 --> 2:00:54.520]  comply no private sales of guns which is legal in almost every state
[2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:58.600]  private citizens get to sell the guns they've bought for themselves
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:02.200]  at flea markets at garage sales to their neighbors
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:06.120]  at gun shows and they've tried to ban this all over the country federally and
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:10.200]  at the state level they've been defeated so now in austin the b at fe
[2:01:10.200 --> 2:01:13.240]  and the austin police just showed up at the gun show and said it's all shut down
[2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:16.760]  you're not doing it then had some illegal aliens sell it to some private
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:21.400]  seller who refused to follow it and they and the b at fe is all over it trying
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:24.600]  to set you up because it's not illegal to sell it to your neighbor it
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:27.960]  somehow they claim though that if it's an illegal alien
[2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:31.320]  and of course the illegal always tries to tell you they're an illegal to sting you
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:34.760]  so they're doing anything they can to go out for law-abiding citizens
[2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:39.240]  i want to go to keith in ohio says he's a police officer mark in florida
[2:01:39.240 --> 2:01:42.280]  i appreciate them having the courage to call in in this once
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:46.200]  free country to give us their response to this we talked to the brother of a
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:51.800]  police officer when the b at fe did knock and talk
[2:01:51.800 --> 2:01:54.920]  coming to their door where they show them say we want to talk about your guns
[2:01:54.920 --> 2:01:58.680]  let us come in and inspect them and then force their way in and he was freaked
[2:01:58.680 --> 2:02:03.400]  out keith in ohio what's your take on all of this
[2:02:03.400 --> 2:02:07.000]  well alex is just one more step down that path to
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:10.520]  trying to take firearms away from the private individuals
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:15.720]  in ohio we had a couple years ago state sales agents came to the dating gun show
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:19.240]  and went around started issuing tickets to everyone for not having a vendors
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:22.680]  license and they got about halfway through the show
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:25.640]  and they went to this one guy who was set up there and they asked him for his
[2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:29.560]  id and he gave it to him they wrote him a ticket he said what you're doing is
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:32.360]  illegal and you're going to get in trouble and they started saying we know
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:35.960]  what we're doing he goes uh your boss is so and so
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:39.400]  yeah his boss is so and so yeah i'm his boss
[2:02:39.400 --> 2:02:43.720]  and you're handing out tickets to people who have already paid taxes on items
[2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:48.600]  and the reselling them at private sale he said all the citations you've issued
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:51.160]  are illegal so they were going around trying to get them
[2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:54.760]  pulled back in and a bunch of the dealers had already left the private
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:02:58.520]  dealers now the vendors license dealers and the firearms dealers were still
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:02.600]  set up at the show and in doing so mere bloomberg this
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:06.360]  year came out sent undercover sting operatives to the show
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:10.200]  that's right bloomberg stay there i'm gonna hold you over this is so king you
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:14.040]  know because i i recognize the cases you're bringing up and this is a very
[2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:18.200]  important call bloomberg is in more than 14 states
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:21.720]  he's even down in florida sending his undercover people
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:25.800]  into other states so he can then try to sue your states
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:29.560]  like he is the king of the country go ahead yeah what they did is they were
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:32.520]  coming into the gun shows and then going around
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:37.560]  and trying to buy off a private sales and then after the degree on price and
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:40.280]  stuff they would drop a hint that maybe they
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:43.160]  couldn't pass a background check or do some other stuff
[2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:47.720]  and then they were using selective video not using all the videos
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:51.640]  and then trying to shut down the dating gun shows well what happened is the
[2:03:51.640 --> 2:03:55.480]  guy that runs the dating gun shows came out on his own and he's issued little
[2:03:55.480 --> 2:03:59.880]  booklets that he hands out at the gun show making sure everyone's
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:03.960]  following the state law that's how you do it you get everybody together
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:07.400]  to realize the stings are happening or they kill our culture
[2:04:07.400 --> 2:04:10.840]  right and what they did is the he's issuing his little booklets to educate
[2:04:10.840 --> 2:04:14.040]  sellers on how to recognize a straw buyer or how to
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:17.480]  trade these things happen and giving them out saying look
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:21.240]  you gotta just check he's a resident of the state that they're over the proper
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:25.480]  age if it's 18 for a rifle or shotgun or 21 for a handgun
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:29.000]  you verify their driver's license they verify years
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:32.520]  that makes it legal sale in ohio without having to go through the
[2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:35.960]  bit and mix background check but again under common law and as
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:39.560]  citizens can sell to their neighbor it's not their fault that turns out the
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:42.840]  neighbor was a bad guy you know the answer is more guns less
[2:04:42.840 --> 2:04:45.080]  crimes stay there i want to come back to you keith and let you finish from
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:48.440]  ohio a police officer than mark and florida police officer

[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:14.440]  and the gcn radio network
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:20.200]  for those that just joined us this is how tyranny works
[2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:24.040]  in the past they would have cities and counties pass unconstitutional local
[2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:30.600]  ordinances against private sale of guns at
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:34.840]  flea markets gun shows garage sales to your neighbors
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:39.720]  to your grandson giving a gun under the law they tried to pass in
[2:08:39.720 --> 2:08:45.800]  texas to your grandson is a crime we beat those laws
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:49.880]  so the batfv the feds are running around all over the country
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:53.000]  just intimidating stinging harassing trying to set up
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:58.200]  people at gun shows now in austin they don't even do that they just say no
[2:08:58.200 --> 2:09:00.520]  more private sales you've got to register at all
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:04.280]  you've got to go to the nix system with no law not even an unconstitutional
[2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:09.800]  local ordinance under them and they know this is illegal
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:13.720]  they know and and keith as a police officer in ohio who's seen this go on
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:16.600]  but uh who have been successful against
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:20.200]  defeating it i mean what is your take on
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:25.080]  on just how much trouble the apd and the batfv should get in trouble for or
[2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:27.960]  what laws you believe this violates or regulations
[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:31.160]  and separately what would you do if you were an austin cop
[2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:35.000]  order to do unconstitutional things
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:39.880]  do something unconstitutional you have a process and it's usually in most law
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:43.560]  enforcement agencies it's written right into their standards and procedures
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:47.000]  you do not have to follow a lawful order period
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:51.240]  if it's unlawful uh it is unlawful and you do not follow it
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:54.040]  if you get a write-up for you get a write-up for it but you're going to end
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:57.720]  up winning that because it goes against your policies and goes against the
[2:09:57.720 --> 2:10:02.360]  laws of the state of wherever you're working and uh any administrator who
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.120]  tries to force you to do an unlawful act by coercion is also subjecting
[2:10:06.120 --> 2:10:12.120]  himself to an um usc 1983 lawsuit but then they
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:16.680]  don't promote you that's sometimes the case but
[2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:21.160]  you have to have the sand in the wheels so to say to slow down this train rack
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:24.840]  and you have to get good police chiefs i mean why
[2:10:24.840 --> 2:10:27.960]  20 years ago police chiefs were always from the town
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:32.040]  why do they always bring them in department of justice recommended
[2:10:32.040 --> 2:10:38.280]  from some far-off city big money buys big power and in our state in
[2:10:38.280 --> 2:10:40.840]  Ohio we have the big cities of cleveland and
[2:10:40.840 --> 2:10:46.280]  Cincinnati and columbus and Dayton and Toledo and their chiefs of police
[2:10:46.280 --> 2:10:49.320]  and somewhat to the effect their local sheriffs
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:54.280]  are influenced by that big donor money and uh they follow the party line
[2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:58.600]  the small county sheriffs are pro gun and pro second amendment
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:03.320]  the big city ones are pretty much influenced by the large donors
[2:11:03.320 --> 2:11:09.240]  from those uh say left-wing uh radical organizations that don't want guns
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:12.200]  they have a bigger crime violence in their cities
[2:11:12.200 --> 2:11:15.560]  and they think that that's just due to the fact that guns are readily
[2:11:15.560 --> 2:11:18.920]  accessible even though the bureau of justice statistics show
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:23.240]  that less than one percent of u.s gun crimes came from gun shows
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:27.640]  well people don't rob heavily armed rural areas
[2:11:27.640 --> 2:11:31.880]  or cities where people are heavily armed the crime statistics are
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:37.240]  voluminous that the cess pits of crime or chicago new york and la
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:42.120]  every major city that has massive victim disarmament legislation and i'm
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:46.520]  going to go to another police officer but keith in closing
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:51.880]  in 1775 the revolutionary war started
[2:11:51.880 --> 2:11:55.880]  over gun confiscation and the resistance was
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:12:00.600]  led by the local constables by the local police and sheriffs
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:04.200]  and i believe that's going to happen again that's why obama is creating a
[2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:07.880]  council of governors so he can rubber stamp and take over the states but
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:12.040]  still claim that the statesome have authority but he appoints the governors
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:16.680]  that's why they've set up homeland security but they've got a problem
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:20.920]  most the military and police i talked to are fully awakened upset about what's
[2:12:20.920 --> 2:12:25.880]  happening we see national studies 98 percent of police said they're pro
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:28.840]  second amendment so how can this be happening
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:31.480]  you have 90 plus percent or pro second amendment
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:35.560]  and the police and military are awake i mean is it that the leadership are a
[2:12:35.560 --> 2:12:39.640]  bunch of globalist well i wouldn't say that the local
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:43.320]  leadership are but on the national level and the large donor base
[2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:46.840]  is of that mindset and it's a trickle down effect
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:50.840]  they ramp the grants towards that type of stuff you apply to try to get
[2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:55.800]  grants to help out your local small agencies due to budget cuts
[2:12:55.800 --> 2:12:59.800]  and the wording and the way that they ramp those grants out
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:06.680]  makes you have to take the bait and buy into their programs to get it
[2:13:06.680 --> 2:13:10.360]  our police officer is starting to wake up faster
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:15.720]  in your area yes the rural law enforcement officer
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:19.720]  is from the local community he is of the local community
[2:13:19.720 --> 2:13:24.520]  and has the mindset of the local community the big city ones are often
[2:13:24.520 --> 2:13:28.360]  people that are pulled out of the socialized institutions
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:31.640]  the big city and they don't have the same mindset
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:36.760]  the local officer is covering three four five hundred square miles by himself
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:41.400]  he realizes that an armed populace is a very good benefit to him
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:45.960]  when he needs a backup a lot of your local agencies all have that policy
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:51.400]  that they can deputize somebody on the spot to assist them in apprehending
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:56.360]  a criminal and in fact in ohio it's still the law that it's a civil penalty
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:00.360]  if you do not aid a law enforcement officer same thing in texas
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:03.640]  same thing in texas i mean my mother growing up in austin
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:07.160]  when somebody got out of the prison or the jail or the lunatic asylum and she
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:11.000]  lived near that the the sheriff will just drive around and
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:13.960]  knock on doors they come help me get your rifles
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:18.920]  now if you try to do that the police will gun you down in my town
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:24.840]  in ohio that law still exists and it's sometimes used in the rural areas where
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:27.960]  somebody's trying to apprehend a criminal and somebody usually just a good
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:31.560]  citizen will jump out and try to assist that officer
[2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:34.840]  but the statutes are still on the book for that to happen
[2:14:34.840 --> 2:14:37.960]  we need to get back to that that's real homeland security
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:42.280]  keith thank you so much for calling thank you alex this is shocking to me
[2:14:42.280 --> 2:14:45.880]  though folks this isn't using business license ride-ups or
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:48.680]  or bureaucracy this is just showing up and saying
[2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:53.400]  we are going to lawlessly it's that's what lawlessness is no law
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:55.960]  i mean it's one thing of a law is unconstitutional but this is show up
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:15:01.080]  with no law and say we're shutting down your private sales at the gun show
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:05.320]  let's go to mark in florida then curtain demo mark in florida another police
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:09.320]  officer what do you think of this here's the notice right here
[2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:12.920]  it's disgusting it's totally unconstitutional
[2:15:12.920 --> 2:15:19.320]  and people should put up a red flag and not go along with it
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:22.040]  what do you think went through the minds of the austin police when they were
[2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:26.760]  ordered to go help the feds do this you know i think it's like you were
[2:15:26.760 --> 2:15:30.360]  talking about the knock and talks earlier and you know people
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:34.120]  just give in most of the time they'll just let let officers come in their
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:38.760]  house and search or do whatever and it's the same thing with traffic stops
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:42.120]  police officers make traffic stops every day for a traffic
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:46.680]  traffic violation and then they say you might have searched your car and
[2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:51.720]  95% of them won't stand up and say no and they'll know that they have stuff in
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:56.440]  their car that's contraband but they won't do it
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:15:59.880]  and people just need to not be intimidated
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:03.960]  and they need to stand up and if we all stand together they can't put everybody
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:08.920]  in jail um it's just it's just discussing what's
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:11.720]  happening in this country overall it's just terrible
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:15.080]  well i want to warn everybody like i did in the first hour
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:19.240]  the new london kilo decision said private interest can take your land
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:24.040]  without paying you and that's what tyranny is this is all being done so
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:29.080]  your pension funds can be taken so that taxes can be raised
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:33.640]  to pay interest to the foreign banks and that's why this is happening
[2:16:33.640 --> 2:16:37.960]  that's what homeland security is for and so all these domesticated cowards that
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:41.640]  are scared of guns and the second amendment they need to know
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:45.000]  that tyranny isn't going to stop just with their guns this is only the
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:49.080]  beginning uh mark i mean uh points you want to
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:55.160]  make about this statements you want to make about this
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:58.280]  just that people need to wake up i'm trying to
[2:16:58.280 --> 2:17:01.640]  to wake up my officers as much as i can um
[2:17:01.640 --> 2:17:05.160]  for instance at the beginning of the year i did a i did a little
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:08.840]  presentation at roll call my um my predictions for
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:12.360]  2010 and it kind of opened up the door
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:16.680]  and i had an officer uh uh approached me um the other day
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:21.000]  just before roll call and he said hey i watched just just even tour last night
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:25.160]  and um then i had to start roll call i didn't get a chance to talk to him
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:28.600]  so later on in the evening i i sent him a message and i said hey you want to
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:31.720]  stop and get some coffee and he said sure and so we
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:35.640]  had an opportunity to you know to talk about issues and stuff like that so
[2:17:35.640 --> 2:17:38.760]  that's what i'm trying to do i'm trying to get people woken up to it i'm
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:42.200]  trying to get people on the same page because we need to stand together
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:46.280]  that's the only way that we're going to win this this battle and mark i agree
[2:17:46.280 --> 2:17:49.640]  with you because i told msnbc yesterday when they came to interview me for
[2:17:49.640 --> 2:17:53.720]  chris mathews for a documentary he's making for msnbc
[2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:57.320]  i explained to the lady i said this has all been scripted and we have the ran
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:00.200]  corporation and all their own admissions
[2:18:00.200 --> 2:18:03.880]  they're they want to squeeze the people they want to push the people
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:07.000]  while brainwashing the police against the population
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:10.680]  so the police get abusive the public starts hating the police
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:14.200]  to make us enemies with each other and they do plan to have a violent
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:17.240]  revolution in this country that they're going to use
[2:18:17.240 --> 2:18:21.080]  to bring in total police state in the process local police are going to be
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:26.520]  devastated we need to stop this now we need to not
[2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:30.280]  have this go to violence but the establishment
[2:18:30.280 --> 2:18:33.480]  wants it they are pushing because they're going to be off in their ivory
[2:18:33.480 --> 2:18:36.600]  towers in europe and in new york with their body guards
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:39.640]  and they're going to have you mark with all these officers under you sounds like
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:44.760]  you're an officer in your apartment marching out to engage in tyranny
[2:18:44.760 --> 2:18:48.200]  as they bring in unlimited illegal aliens and criminals
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:51.880]  as the society implodes as crime rates explode
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:56.440]  as the society falls apart as the public is becoming moral and very
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.880]  evil it's not just police that we see becoming more and more corrupt i mean
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:03.400]  we are a sick society and we need good leadership
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:08.040]  like yours and others to take the risk of sticking your head up to the tyranny
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:11.160]  because the risk is greater to go along with it
[2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:14.600]  we know where this river leads over the edge of the falls
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:17.480]  we've got to get out of the comfort zone now
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:21.320]  we have got to i mean i've got chills right now folks do you realize how real
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:24.920]  this is the danger we're in i mean almost every
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:28.600]  single member of the obama administration gives public speeches
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:32.840]  saying they're communist and they want mouset and they like mousetong
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:36.600]  i mean you cannot make this magnitude of evil up
[2:19:36.600 --> 2:19:40.440]  mark god bless you good to hear from you

[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:17.080]  and then there's the commerce clause the constitution the feds are in austin
[2:24:17.080 --> 2:24:21.800]  they order the apd to go down there and say no private sales which is completely
[2:24:21.800 --> 2:24:24.840]  legal they've tried to ban it at the legislature
[2:24:24.840 --> 2:24:29.160]  over and over again i mean if they get away with this the sky's the limit i
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:32.280]  want to bring curtain imo i'll be wrote a very important article
[2:24:32.280 --> 2:24:35.640]  feds cops attempt to shut down legal gun sales in austin
[2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:39.320]  steve watson has the headline at prison planet dot com vat f notice bans
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:45.320]  private gun sales in texas they did ban it and then to make it look legal
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:48.680]  they had some illegal alien we were confirming this happened people witness
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:52.200]  this arrest go in and some old guy was trying to sell a
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:55.960]  shotgun he sold it to the illegal which wasn't illegal because
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:58.840]  it's a private sale it's not his job to know that under the law
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:01.960]  you still have that private right he wasn't a gun dealer under federal
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:06.280]  control and they arrested him so they do that
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:10.360]  in these staged events going to curtain imo curt we need to really get on this
[2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:13.640]  and go over what jack mclan pointed out go over the points i made the police
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:17.720]  officers that called in how they've tried to use uh i remember seeing that the
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:23.160]  news uh in several states ohio pennsylvania other places
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:27.480]  where they go in and try to ban private sales through local business licenses
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:32.760]  but they can't ban garage sales they can't ban
[2:25:32.760 --> 2:25:36.840]  all of these different events though the feds put a ruling out this year
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:40.760]  remember the fox news headline five years in prison for garage sale
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:44.760]  so they're trying to implement this you've already paid tax on something
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:48.360]  you're allowed to resell it so they trial these regulations now they're not
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:51.240]  even doing that they just show up and say no sales
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:55.000]  i mean that is tyranny when they just announce i've got a gun i've got a
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:58.600]  uniform i'm your god
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:02.120]  yeah you know alex even under the uh federal firearms ownership protection
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:06.360]  act in 1986 people aren't required to uh you know do
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:09.560]  background checks on people they sell guns to so they're even violating their
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:13.560]  own uh you know their own laws against the second amendment
[2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:17.080]  be sure and add that that's right we've passed laws to stop this before
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:20.360]  and they just break the law they're not just breaking the law
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:23.480]  making something up when there's no law they're breaking laws
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:28.520]  right you know like i told you prior to coming on this is a totally egregious
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:31.080]  violation of the commerce clause of the constitution
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:34.680]  and i think legally if people are going to stop this kind of nonsense that's
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:38.360]  what they're going to have to go to is is um you know go to the supreme court and
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:44.360]  argue that this is a violation of the commerce clause of the constitution
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:47.400]  well we need to hit them on all fronts we need to stop this
[2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:53.000]  in austin right now kurt but we need to just turn out more stories more of the
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.400]  angles and point out to people you've done a great job of this one article
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:01.720]  that this is completely illegal i mean you they can't just make up whatever
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:04.360]  they want no they can't but you know what they're
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:08.840]  trying to do in um you know uh what's her name carol mccarthy
[2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:12.520]  the notorious gun grabbers she introduced the gun shell loophole closing
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:18.040]  act of 2009 let me see it's hr 23 24 and what they're
[2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:22.600]  trying to do is is close down at the gun shows through this new law and they're
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:26.760]  actually trying to tie this to terrorism if you read the if you read the bill
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:30.200]  you know they make these comparisons to you know illegal gun sales being
[2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:35.960]  terrorism it's insane
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:39.240]  i just hope frank wattenberg also introduced the bill so this is the
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:43.400]  democrats are introduced another bill too this is called gun show background
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:46.680]  checked act of 2009 and that's another issue
[2:27:46.680 --> 2:27:50.600]  obama keeps saying i don't want your guns even though he writes all these
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:52.840]  letters introduced laws of the state senator
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:27:55.800]  even though all his zars are calling for complete banning
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:59.560]  even though they're harassing everybody they're coming after our guns
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:04.600]  while denying they're doing it right well the democrats are really behind
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:09.640]  these laws i mean uh... the loophole closing act has 35
[2:28:09.640 --> 2:28:13.880]  co-sponsors mostly democrats and latenberg senate bill has 15
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:17.240]  co-sponsors all of them democrats though this is basically coming out of the
[2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:21.960]  obama administration as you pointed out
[2:28:21.960 --> 2:28:26.600]  but again he uses that military tactic of going with the bills going with the
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:30.280]  regulations going with the color of law going with the tyranny
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:34.360]  whilst getting on the news going these crazy conspiracy theorists they think
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:37.320]  that we want their guns
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:40.440]  well it doesn't help that there's like 17 states that are
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:44.280]  you know regulating gun shows as well
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:48.360]  um we see california rhodo island connecticut oregon new york illinois
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:52.360]  and colorado and four states hawaii maryland new jersey and pennsylvania
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:57.320]  require background check big gun shows on handgun so states are working with the
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:28:59.880]  feds as well to implement it
[2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:02.600]  well we know they're coming after our guns but
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:06.520]  the issue is this is a new development
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:09.720]  to just have the fed show up and say we don't need laws anymore
[2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:13.320]  you're done and then arrest someone i mean that
[2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:16.440]  insane i mean it's insane that the federal government has no
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:21.160]  jurisdiction over interest they'll have a firearm at all
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:24.280]  none i'm at the count under the commerce clause
[2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:29.320]  we need another headline like gun sales banned in austin without law
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:32.600]  illegal and then point out the commerce clause because you've done some great

[2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:18.360]  blow by blow tell us what really happened what they told you what unfolded
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:21.880]  okay the the exact the exact story is
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:26.840]  thursday at two o'clock we had a meeting and austin texas
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:31.160]  with the austin police department uh the ats
[2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:35.960]  and the people from the north event uh north market event center
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:39.800]  and h e b now the reason h e b is important is
[2:37:39.800 --> 2:37:45.080]  they're actually the main leaseholder under walmart walmart owns that building
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:48.840]  that everybody knows as the rocket center or now the north
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:55.320]  uh north austin event center so what happened was they made these
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:59.640]  recommendations to me and basically
[2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:03.560]  because the gun show that used to be there uh before us
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:09.800]  was a lot larger a lot bigger that the they said that the apd
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:17.640]  and apf had tending cases uh of of people selling firearms in the gun shows
[2:38:17.640 --> 2:38:20.840]  without a license actually setting up and i knew that was going to happen
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:24.760]  that's the extortion basically we're going to end up setting you up
[2:38:24.760 --> 2:38:28.760]  we're going to shut your show down if you don't let us through color of law
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:31.720]  intimidate people and go ahead and basically kill your show
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:34.760]  to begin with running their fake stings in there
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:38.760]  with the illegal aliens they use go ahead exactly and
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:42.600]  basically what happened is in this meeting when we first sat down
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:46.520]  the detectives that are in this meeting did not even realize that we were a
[2:38:46.520 --> 2:38:51.160]  different gun show promoter they thought that there was no difference and
[2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:55.160]  only after uh only after we told them that we're not even the same
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:58.280]  gun show that you had these these cases again
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:02.040]  did you realize that this is i'm gonna stop you i'm gonna stop you this is too
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.800]  huge this is so illegal they are so hamfisted they think
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:09.800]  they're doing an internal sting plea bargain uh with you to get you to wave
[2:39:09.800 --> 2:39:12.600]  your rights hey we've got these cases against you buddy boy
[2:39:12.600 --> 2:39:16.040]  exactly see they've already run the other show out of business or out of
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:19.880]  austin now they're now they've got you and they're like listen mac
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:23.400]  you're gonna do this with us you're gonna help us run stings we're gonna mount
[2:39:23.400 --> 2:39:26.120]  cameras in the ceiling i don't know this happened but this happened in other
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:29.880]  areas or once you were pimped by them then they would bring that up later
[2:39:29.880 --> 2:39:33.400]  we're shutting down guns in america we may let you sell for a while
[2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:36.440]  but the second amendment's over you know that's basically the message so this
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:39.720]  gets a lot deeper and a lot i'm sorry i i just love the second
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:43.800]  amendment i love commerce i love freedom i'm gonna shut up i'm gonna shut up
[2:39:43.800 --> 2:39:46.600]  start over okay you get called let me guess

[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:10.600]  and uh well they invited h e b to the meeting and basically what it was was
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:15.800]  they scared h e b and to basically telling me i had to
[2:40:15.800 --> 2:40:19.480]  follow these recommendations or i wouldn't have a show and what's on the
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:23.160]  stop that's racketeering right there organized crime organized fraud
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:26.520]  extortion they get the they get the leaseholder you've already
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:30.600]  contracted they twist arms right there to violate the second
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:35.000]  amendment and commerce and free market they get h e b under threat
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:39.400]  you under criminal threat all these threats to agree to this and you have

[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:47.800]  this is so criminal please continue so basically
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:51.640]  they we had about a two-hour meeting back and forth back and forth and i asked
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:55.000]  them specifically why is this happening and often
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:58.440]  and nowhere else and they just backpedaled and
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:03.640]  said well because we're here meaning that the two detectives and the uh
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:09.560]  and the and the other atf agent and i and i asked them then i was like well
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:14.120]  you realize i'm basically the smallest promoter on the
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:18.280]  you know on the totem pole i don't find a coincidence that
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:21.080]  you know you found found a promoter that you could actually
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:24.840]  you know pressure into doing this because i mean
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:28.600]  they told me thursday only had two choices you know it was either canceled
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:32.040]  the show on friday when vendors have already driven you know long distances
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:35.400]  to set up oh my god try to comply with their
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:41.160]  recommendations so that was a threat of ruin that was a threat of embargo with
[2:41:41.160 --> 2:41:44.040]  no oh that sir you've got a civil rights lawsuit
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:49.720]  on the apd and the bat fe that they are if you stand up to them
[2:41:49.720 --> 2:41:52.120]  they're over and then when they try to rack a tear
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:55.320]  and set up your gun shows more you've really got them
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:41:58.840]  my god these people are criminal so so they told you
[2:41:58.840 --> 2:42:02.520]  you do what we say color of law or we're shutting you down
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:05.960]  that was that is ten times worse than just
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:08.920]  oh my god do you realize what they've done sir
[2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:13.240]  oh yeah no i realized that it's just that you know i i i didn't they told me
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:16.840]  thursday that you know this had to be done and by friday
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:20.920]  you know vendors are starting to show up and i'm trying to explain to them
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:24.120]  you know what happened no they always do it in the quiet they always do it
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:27.800]  behind closed doors and then ask you to go out and take the heat
[2:42:27.800 --> 2:42:31.480]  sir what were these guys names what did they say to you how did they treat you
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:35.000]  what went on give us all the details of this criminal operation
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:40.040]  this is a mafia this is how the mafia operated in new york and chicago
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:43.880]  well from the austin police department it was a sergeant flaming
[2:42:43.880 --> 2:42:48.840]  that was in the meeting a detective long a detective russell
[2:42:48.840 --> 2:42:54.200]  and a detective vineyard and from the atf it was a daniel jones
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:57.800]  those were the law the law people that were inside the meeting
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:01.720]  and they and they took you in there and squeezed you to basically become their
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:05.000]  operative when you're a law abiding citizen
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  yeah well basically you know they sat there and they read all this long sheet
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:15.320]  of 911 calls uh vending cases all this stuff that they had dug up
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:18.680]  over the four you know however many years that they were doing it against the
[2:43:18.680 --> 2:43:23.960]  other gun show 14 and and then when i told them well how
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:27.480]  actually the gentleman from the north austin event i'm gonna stop you again
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:31.880]  they always use emotion oh look over the years there's been you know 15 problems
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:34.920]  in in the 14 years that's they were there when i'm
[2:43:34.920 --> 2:43:38.920]  they were there when i went on air 14 years ago so it more than 14 years
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:42.600]  and so see that's the new law they use like in france
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:46.040]  they had 152 husbands and wives kill each other
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:49.800]  so now they're banning arguing and maven ban marriage uh oh
[2:43:49.800 --> 2:43:53.080]  some parents abuse their kids now everyone gets a camera in their home in
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:57.320]  england when you have kids see oh there might be somebody that gets a
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:00.360]  gun and commits a crime so you have to do this now
[2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:04.680]  outside of law i mean this is i'm sorry please continue
[2:44:04.680 --> 2:44:08.280]  well the the the worst part of it all was you know people coming in through the
[2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:11.160]  door that that i handed these fliers to and that they
[2:44:11.160 --> 2:44:14.680]  willingly signed a petition for you know the people that didn't take the time
[2:44:14.680 --> 2:44:17.880]  to actually hear you know what was going on because they were so
[2:44:17.880 --> 2:44:21.800]  frustrated you know basically called me every name in the book i had one older
[2:44:21.800 --> 2:44:25.480]  gentleman that was sir that's your hold on that that's one of your major
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:28.520]  you watch your next show compared to the previous shows
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:31.880]  will be down by 50 percent unless we get the word out more than that
[2:44:31.880 --> 2:44:35.560]  that's gonna be done sir they destroyed you they have engaged in an act of co
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:38.360]  and tell pro write that word down it's illegal
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:42.200]  they got caught in the 70s doing it to destroy you they infiltrated
[2:44:42.200 --> 2:44:46.280]  they knew that this would destroy your operation and they have
[2:44:46.280 --> 2:44:52.600]  this is this is assault this is a robbery this is grand larceny sir
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:56.040]  i i i feel the same way and that's that thing was that they sat there and told
[2:44:56.040 --> 2:44:59.800]  me well if you do this you'll get more licensed
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:03.720]  uh you know ffl federal firearms licensed dealers in there well
[2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:10.040]  actually i had two of my largest uh ffl dealers actually cancel the day
[2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:12.680]  the day before the show when i told them about it
[2:45:12.680 --> 2:45:17.880]  they don't want to be in a major sting op did they tell you
[2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:20.200]  or if you would have gone along with them i wish i'd known about this and i told
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:22.920]  you to go along with it enough to really get into their criminal operation
[2:45:22.920 --> 2:45:25.080]  because we're infiltrating these criminals right now as the organic
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:28.920]  citizenry i mean they are the mafia we're the equivalent of the real
[2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:33.240]  citizens fbi here you i guarantee you they would have asked you to set people
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:37.400]  up next or did they ask that no they did not ask that
[2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:41.560]  okay all right continue every detail of their operation
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:45.240]  give me every uh so so you're in this building continue
[2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:49.400]  yeah i'm in this building uh i mean it's basically a two-hour meeting of
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:55.320]  of them trying to you know tell all the woes of the show that was there before
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:59.480]  and the whole time the guy from h e b is hearing all this and you know this
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:02.840]  gentleman doesn't probably he's probably never even been to a gun show he
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:05.720]  doesn't you know he doesn't care about a gun show so he basically
[2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:09.240]  turns to me and says well you need to follow these recommendations or there's
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:13.640]  no show recommendations so so they threaten to
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:17.640]  financially ruin you if you don't follow their recommendation
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:21.080]  which is color of law racketeering fraud
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:24.840]  man these guys are in trouble now who said that to you specifically
[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:28.040]  well the gentleman's name is brett baker he's the guy from
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:33.720]  uh h e b and he was the one so sit and i'm saying what the police did to him
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:37.720]  was illegal threatening him and his business in your business if he didn't
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:42.120]  do that what i'm saying is the police so so they use them to do this
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:45.640]  yeah yeah because i know i i know i know where my
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:49.400]  i know where my uh morality meter stands and if they would have looked me
[2:46:49.400 --> 2:46:52.360]  straight in the face and said you need to follow these recommendations
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:55.960]  they know what i would have told them but basically by them inviting h e b to
[2:46:55.960 --> 2:46:59.480]  the meeting they knew that they could intimidate
[2:46:59.480 --> 2:47:02.360]  him and by him telling me i had to follow these recommendations or they were
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:05.080]  going to close the door then i mean i would have had to cancel the show
[2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:09.240]  because now did any of the police or did or did the federal regulator the
[2:47:09.240 --> 2:47:13.880]  federal thug did they did they ever say you've
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:18.280]  got to do this no which even shows more evidence they
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:21.800]  they didn't they didn't they they made it a point
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:25.080]  to keep on repeating themselves these are just recommendations these are just
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:28.840]  recommendation where they knew the whole time when they called this meeting
[2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:32.200]  and they invited this person from h e b that he would choose the decision that
[2:47:32.200 --> 2:47:36.920]  he that's only more for proof of the fraud we have the notice they wrote up
[2:47:36.920 --> 2:47:41.000]  we have them saying you must they produce this correct
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:44.440]  no no we we we produce that notice that we handed out
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:48.280]  they told you to produce it though yes they said that that would be a good way
[2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:53.480]  to let the public know what was going on did they did they give you an email or
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:56.680]  did they verbally tell you how to write it no they verbally though they just
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:47:59.320]  verbally told me yeah they don't want a paper trail because boy let me tell you
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:03.080]  this is he let look they're in the jury in the land won't burn these guys
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:06.120]  because because they're there there's you know just like when the mafia gets
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:09.080]  caught with different layers to protect themselves that only burns them
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:11.320]  worse
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:15.400]  no i understand and like i said i i received you know i had a gentleman that

[2:48:30.520 --> 2:48:35.080]  i'm so pro gun and pro right that it's not even funny to have a gentleman
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:38.280]  three times my age tell me that you know that
[2:48:38.280 --> 2:48:41.960]  i mean i didn't know what else to tell him besides i'm sorry

[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.760]  the lowest on gun show uh promoter promoters we're the
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:06.280]  bottom totem pole no i understand let me stop you right there let me stop you
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:09.960]  were there police officers or bat fe goons
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:15.000]  ordering around to make sure that people were told about this and going
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:18.760]  around checking uh because you said they did bust somebody
[2:49:18.760 --> 2:49:23.080]  in there for the non-crime of selling a gun to somebody without a license
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:26.840]  yes you have them they they were there they
[2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:30.200]  they were there saturday the atf and and the detectives that were in the
[2:49:30.200 --> 2:49:34.760]  meeting they were they were all there saturday
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:39.000]  man this is evil so i also heard that they
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  set somebody up in a private sale with an illegal is that accurate
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:46.920]  well i i don't know i don't know the the great details of it so i don't want to
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:50.200]  say anything that's not true but i did witness them escorting
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:53.720]  one of my vendors out that has sold a gun to somebody
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:57.880]  and then he was outside for i don't know probably an hour and a half and then
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:50:01.080]  they released him i guess so they did it for show
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:05.000]  more color of law just like the feds pay for billboards that say reporting
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.640]  legal guns with a picture of a revolver
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:11.400]  there is no law against the revolver creating the perception
[2:50:11.400 --> 2:50:16.120]  that we are a criminal group of gun owners exactly but yeah they definitely
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:18.920]  did it in front of everybody so everybody could be
[2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.840]  sickening filth sir i've got to hold you over i i need to

[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:50.680]  i mean he was the one that proposed the recommendations
[2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:54.280]  that that we followed but as far as the rest of the meeting he didn't say a lot

[2:54:17.800 --> 2:54:22.840]  shows up in austin gets totally needs to show up at a meeting they've got the
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:26.440]  h.e.b owners of the former crockett center but you can't name something after
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:30.200]  david crockett that's evil so they've named it something else
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:33.720]  and they tell them you're not going to have your gun show unless you do this
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:37.880]  and the batfv says here's what we think you should ride up and say to people
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:42.200]  then they're there they do a show arrest release the person
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:47.000]  i mean this is all fraud this is the this is classical
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.960]  tyranny this is how it worked in russia and nazi germany
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:53.720]  and soviet china this is what they're doing when you put your kids in public
[2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:56.680]  school they're learning to hate the second amendment
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:01.560]  sir you fought back against this so did the police or anybody or it sound like
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:03.880]  they knew what they were doing was really illegal so they were being careful
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:07.320]  but not careful enough because what we have here
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:11.400]  and the fake arrest did they start getting upset by your petition to the
[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:15.080]  attorney general because you're right who advised you to go to the state
[2:55:15.080 --> 2:55:19.960]  because the state writes the laws they can't just make up laws on their own
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:22.840]  yeah no they didn't they didn't they didn't i don't know if they even saw the
[2:55:22.840 --> 2:55:25.640]  petition because they they didn't even come in the front door they came in
[2:55:25.640 --> 2:55:29.080]  and actually a side door of the show
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:32.280]  so i don't and the petition was right there at the front door were where
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:36.120]  people enter and the thing that the other thing
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:41.080]  that i was going to mention is uh what what they did and what they
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:44.760]  basically made me follow you know our shows are small anyways
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:47.720]  and compared to the gun shows they're really small but
[2:55:47.720 --> 2:55:50.840]  you know we're the only gun show that allows you to come back sunday
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:54.040]  with your Saturday's admission so we try to do things differently to help
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:57.240]  people you know out and i basically had to go two dollars
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:00.120]  down on a mission to even get people to come in
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:03.880]  once they saw you know 65 of my tables were missing
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:08.760]  because of cancellation so i mean i had i didn't know what else to do
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:11.800]  that's where you can really get them is the fact that they shut down your
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:15.560]  business and financially hurt you and then emotionally hurt you
[2:56:15.560 --> 2:56:19.240]  having people come up and call you a traitor uh and then they didn't trust
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:21.960]  you to probably sign your petition probably thinking the government wanted
[2:56:21.960 --> 2:56:25.000]  their names because they've tried to get gun shows to get social
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:27.560]  security numbers in other areas of the country
[2:56:27.560 --> 2:56:31.640]  other points about what happened were the police pleas with how they ruined
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:36.120]  your freedom and and and illegally intimidated your show into the ground uh
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:40.360]  i mean did you ever talk to me i i want back to the concession stand
[2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:42.760]  which is at the back of the show anybody that's been in that building know
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:46.200]  that it's in the back of the show and the two detectives that were actually in
[2:56:46.200 --> 2:56:48.760]  the meeting were sitting down in civilian clothes
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:52.360]  at one of the tables i guess just watching and surveying everything
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:56.200]  and i walked back to them and where there used to be tables
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:00.600]  uh in the second half of the building uh where you walk directly to the concession
[2:57:00.600 --> 2:57:04.440]  stand there were no more tables so you actually had to walk past a
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:07.240]  bare place of building that was probably 50 feet
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:10.920]  wide where there were no tables anymore because the cancellation and i walked
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:14.120]  back to them and i said take a look around i go i go this
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:17.720]  i hope this is what y'all were looking for and she kind of
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:21.240]  kind of made a uh a half grand and was like well you know
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:24.920]  we don't want to shut you down but we just want everybody
[2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:28.440]  that you know everybody that can't buy guns you know has to go through a
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:33.480]  background check so she admitted the crime i mean i mean she
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:36.440]  admitted there's no law to get the background check
[2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:40.840]  but that's what they wanted and that's what they wanted yes what is her name
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:44.680]  detective belong i don't i don't have her first
[2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:48.680]  she needs to be indicted for racketeering i'm telling you i i i
[2:57:48.680 --> 2:57:52.520]  sir are you going to sue these people i'll do it i'll do whatever i can in
[2:57:52.520 --> 2:57:56.200]  my power just my my financial resources are so
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:57:59.880]  minuscule compared to what it's clear i'm going to get you back on for the
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:04.680]  next show i'm going to be down there this time and we're going to get
[2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:07.880]  hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of people to come support you
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:11.560]  and stand beside you but that's how tyranny works
[2:58:11.560 --> 2:58:15.640]  they grab you then you get blamed for it as the victim we need to come support
[2:58:15.640 --> 2:58:19.880]  you and support your show and not let them kill the austin gun show
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:22.520]  they already shut down the other one that used to be in a city building the
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:25.560]  city so we're not going to allow it now you go out and get a private building
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:29.960]  no you can't have that either uh or or we can find somebody else with a big
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:33.160]  warehouse or building and have it there and they'll try to set us up there
[2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:37.000]  you're gonna have to print out pamphlets to warn everybody but we can't let them
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:41.320]  run everybody off stay there back in one minute

[3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:24.440]  you sir do you understand this is precedent setting but i'll guarantee
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:27.080]  you this is going on covertly all over the country
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:34.040]  oh yeah no i i know i i like i said i i've seen it coming and and then i've
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:36.120]  had that gut feeling that it was coming and
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:39.400]  basically they proved my point with this meeting in this past weekend
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:43.160]  that my personal feeling is that they're just trying to get a foothold
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:46.760]  and if they can get one one show to do it then they probably feel they can get
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:50.920]  all shows to do this well i'm going up against them and boy
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:04:55.080]  let me tell you the batf has even said threatening things to me at the
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:04:59.560]  this very gun show you're talking about they are an absolutely wicked bunch of
[3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:02.600]  unamerican trash this is alex jones with five good
[3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:05.480]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:05:05.480 --> 3:05:09.320]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[3:05:09.320 --> 3:05:12.200]  bill number two our new energies are wants to
[3:05:12.200 --> 3:05:15.480]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:05:15.480 --> 3:05:19.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:05:19.720 --> 3:05:22.920]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:25.560]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:29.480]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[3:05:29.480 --> 3:05:33.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:36.120]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[3:05:36.120 --> 3:05:39.240]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:22.120]  control getting the leaseholder together calling
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:28.120]  the gun show operator in and saying hey we got some cases against your gun show
[3:08:28.120 --> 3:08:31.480]  we've set you up hey i'm not the same guy you ran him out of
[3:08:31.480 --> 3:08:35.080]  austin oh well it doesn't matter you know we're
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:38.440]  going to shut you down and then having the
[3:08:38.440 --> 3:08:41.960]  leaseholder i guess say you've got to do this
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:48.680]  and what we need to do is have the gun show not follow their illegal
[3:08:48.680 --> 3:08:53.160]  unlawful order have notices you give them when they're there
[3:08:53.160 --> 3:08:57.560]  um they don't have any warrant i say kick them out see first they intimidate
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:09:01.400]  you to let them in make them get warrants to come in get
[3:09:01.400 --> 3:09:05.320]  we need to stand up as a country to these people and
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:10.840]  then if they terminate your lease terminate your agreement you've got
[3:09:10.840 --> 3:09:14.760]  all sorts of other lawsuits against the officers all of them for racketeering
[3:09:14.760 --> 3:09:18.920]  official oppression torturous interference interstate commerce because the feds
[3:09:18.920 --> 3:09:22.760]  are involved i mean they are committing so many crimes on the
[3:09:22.760 --> 3:09:28.760]  face of it and we've got a bunch of police officers calling in
[3:09:28.760 --> 3:09:32.920]  keith and indiana and a bunch of others we're going to go to here in a moment
[3:09:32.920 --> 3:09:38.600]  for our guest but we need to rally behind the texas gun show they picked a
[3:09:38.600 --> 3:09:42.680]  little target they picked a soviet town like austin good people in austin but
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:46.200]  run by a bunch of really bad people they're always stealing private property
[3:09:46.200 --> 3:09:49.880]  you name it because if they're able to do this under the dark of night it's
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:53.560]  going to be a precedent i guarantee it's the white house is running this i've
[3:09:53.560 --> 3:09:56.840]  seen similar things going on they're doing this all over the country
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:10:00.440]  we've got to set a precedent nationwide so people know
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:03.800]  how to stand up against them we've been fighting them for 20 years trying to
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:07.400]  shut down the gun shows and once they've shut that down i've read the state
[3:10:07.400 --> 3:10:10.200]  laws they try to pass and the ones they have where you can't even sell your
[3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:14.600]  neighbor to gun can't sell some guns you want to make some money in a garage sale
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:18.040]  this is outrageous this is the last step towards total
[3:10:18.040 --> 3:10:23.240]  registration and confiscation now uh going back to darwin bettiker whose
[3:10:23.240 --> 3:10:27.640]  family runs this he's the operator the texas gun show let's put their website

[3:10:56.200 --> 3:10:59.320]  to be the you know a tough guy or anything but i'm not a wimp and i'm a
[3:10:59.320 --> 3:11:03.000]  constitutionalist and i'm committed to this republic and defeating these
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:07.160]  people and i'm standing beside you i'm gonna get congressman ron paul on this
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:10.920]  gun owners of america larry pratt choose the preservation of firearms ownership
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:13.960]  the texas rifle association we're calling them all
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:20.520]  right now sir we're gonna rally the troops to defeat these people politically
[3:11:20.520 --> 3:11:24.200]  well that's that that's that's definitely that's music to my ears
[3:11:24.200 --> 3:11:28.040]  compared to what i've been hearing over the last 48 hours
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:32.520]  now i want to go to calls with you but i want to go back here to be very careful
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:35.720]  about this meeting specifically they tell you
[3:11:35.720 --> 3:11:39.000]  we'd like you to come down i mean tell us the whole story how they did the
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:42.120]  intimidation how the batf told you how to write this
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:48.920]  how it destroyed your show lay it out i was invited to a facility that austin
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:52.680]  pd uses uh i guess to do interviews and stuff
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:57.720]  like that i had a meeting with austin pd the atf was there
[3:11:57.720 --> 3:12:02.840]  and uh people from uh north austin event center
[3:12:02.840 --> 3:12:07.000]  and it was about a two hour long meeting that took place on thursday
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:11.880]  the day before my vendors were supposed to set up and
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:15.320]  basically it was a long meeting over they started off the meeting
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:18.520]  with you know we don't want to have to shut you down but we will
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:22.840]  it was straight intimidation from the get-go and
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:27.560]  uh they made a long list of uh they read a long list of
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:31.720]  convictions or cases that they had against the former gun show
[3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:34.920]  and they read off all these complaints and everything else by one one calls
[3:12:34.920 --> 3:12:39.720]  everything to this to this location and they didn't even know in the beginning
[3:12:39.720 --> 3:12:42.600]  of the meeting that we were a different show promoter
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:46.120]  and that was over a decade of the other show one of the best records
[3:12:46.120 --> 3:12:49.800]  people driving by on the highway were always calling cops seeing people with
[3:12:49.800 --> 3:12:52.120]  guns because the public's been trained guns are
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:12:55.240]  illegal nobody can put them in their pickup window
[3:12:55.240 --> 3:12:58.120]  people can't walk out of their house and get in their car with them because
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:01.720]  there's a large portion of the population that is completely ignorant
[3:13:01.720 --> 3:13:04.840]  so they use that the ninnying scared public we got to
[3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:08.760]  shut you down go ahead and then in the process of the
[3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:13.880]  meeting the atf agent uh suggested recommendation that we
[3:13:13.880 --> 3:13:17.720]  should follow and he said that he's seen at work in
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:21.560]  other places like detroit and i'm and that right there made me
[3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:25.960]  laugh but so see they've done this before so
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:29.800]  okay detroit i mean a totally federal run cesspit
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:36.120]  okay continuing and basically what so to be clear the batf then was set in the
[3:13:36.120 --> 3:13:40.440]  parameters go ahead after after that they
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:43.560]  you know said what they what they could do they didn't want to have to do but
[3:13:43.560 --> 3:13:47.480]  they said they could uh you know make it to where the
[3:13:47.480 --> 3:13:50.840]  building couldn't be used for anything because of the activities that
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:54.280]  happened in the past and that scared the guy from h e b
[3:13:54.280 --> 3:13:57.880]  oh so again though that's a key threat outside of a court
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:01.720]  outside of law threatening to shut the building down for everything else the
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:04.440]  knitting clubs the swap meets they have there
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:08.040]  threatening to just in the building period threatening their so that so that
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:11.400]  guy's got a cause of action threatening his entire business
[3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:16.200]  and his job as the leaseholder h e b the grocery store chain with walmart
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:20.760]  if he didn't then come down on you exactly and what was his name the
[3:14:20.760 --> 3:14:24.120]  poor guy being grilled by these people his name is
[3:14:24.120 --> 3:14:28.200]  andrew perkel he's the the operating uh
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:31.880]  i guess the operating manager of the north austin vincenzo
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:35.800]  and he was the one that was basically he was the he was a former austin
[3:14:35.800 --> 3:14:39.640]  uh police officer too and he was the one standing up for us
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:43.080]  i mean oh so he was arguing with him how did that go
[3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:46.280]  well i mean every time they tried to every try they thought you know every
[3:14:46.280 --> 3:14:49.480]  time they tried to scare him he basically told him you know don't try to
[3:14:49.480 --> 3:14:53.560]  intimidate me you know i know the law i know what's going on here
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:57.240]  but yet you know it's still intimidated h e b
[3:14:57.240 --> 3:15:01.240]  get get rakel on so h e b was there above him
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:05.720]  yes and so they so and so h e b then i'm h e b
[3:15:05.720 --> 3:15:09.240]  and so h e b then turned to you and said this is the way it is
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:12.440]  yeah they said you need to follow these recommendations
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:16.600]  or basically there'll be no show and the police
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:21.480]  and the batf then smiled with pleasure yes
[3:15:21.480 --> 3:15:25.480]  and uh like i said that they take this whole they take this whole meeting i
[3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.440]  don't know if that's something that they'll give you but it was it was all
[3:15:28.440 --> 3:15:32.760]  it was all taped yeah you need their open record to demand it they'll claim it
[3:15:32.760 --> 3:15:37.480]  malfunctioned and lie but uh my god was that was the event center had the
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:40.680]  former police officer freaked out when you left
[3:15:40.680 --> 3:15:44.520]  no he wasn't freaked out he was just like he just told me you know i i know that
[3:15:44.520 --> 3:15:48.200]  didn't go the way you wanted it to you know when i when they call this meeting
[3:15:48.200 --> 3:15:51.240]  i had i said i would go but they didn't tell me what we're
[3:15:51.240 --> 3:15:54.920]  going to talk about i didn't know what was about to happen
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:15:57.720]  so basically after they locked the doors and the start of the meeting that's
[3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:00.920]  when they told me that you know they got to the point where if i didn't follow
[3:16:00.920 --> 3:16:03.160]  these recommendations i wouldn't gonna have a show
[3:16:03.160 --> 3:16:06.520]  so after i already committed all my resources i said i could towards
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:10.200]  advertising and everything else i mean it was either lose all that
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:13.880]  money and cancel it or try to recoup something and let the public know
[3:16:13.880 --> 3:16:18.440]  what was going on so i chose to let the public know
[3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:22.200]  well you did the right thing and we're going to stand besides you in this
[3:16:22.200 --> 3:16:28.120]  um now how did the batf e god tell you to write this when did he do that and
[3:16:28.120 --> 3:16:31.400]  he didn't he didn't tell me he didn't tell me to write it
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:34.200]  word for word what he said was you might have
[3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:38.360]  something up there to notify the public what's going on because i told him the
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:41.640]  reason i said that is because i told him well what's going to happen is
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:44.920]  everybody comes in the show is going to think it's me
[3:16:44.920 --> 3:16:48.280]  you know it's going to think it's a texas gun show thing and think that
[3:16:48.280 --> 3:16:52.520]  i'm you know flying in the face of freedom when it's not me at all
[3:16:52.520 --> 3:16:55.640]  oh it's even worse they wanted to keep this secret
[3:16:55.640 --> 3:16:59.320]  yeah so basically then he said well you could write something
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:02.360]  saying that that well i told him more than what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:05.240]  write something saying you know in accordance with an
[3:17:05.240 --> 3:17:09.080]  indirection with austin pd and atf this is
[3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:11.880]  this is why you know this is happening this weekend so that's the flyer that
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:15.400]  you're reading and he said oh that's good
[3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:18.520]  yeah basically he said yeah that that will work
[3:17:18.520 --> 3:17:22.200]  because i asked him i go if i follow these recommendations
[3:17:22.200 --> 3:17:25.560]  i go are you going to pay for a full page newspaper ad
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:31.800]  you know saying that it wasn't my idea i didn't do it willingly it was under
[3:17:31.800 --> 3:17:35.000]  the thread of pressure of me you know losing everything that i invested in
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:38.840]  losing my business there that i complied with your recommendations for
[3:17:38.840 --> 3:17:42.360]  that weekend well this is an agency and police
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:45.160]  completely out of control let's talk to kenneth and indiana

[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:16.440]  you know it doesn't matter if you own firearms if you're interested if you're
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:19.720]  not interested in the last thing that you wanted to see
[3:18:19.720 --> 3:18:23.240]  but everyone needs to be involved with what's going on
[3:18:23.240 --> 3:18:28.040]  and uh stand up and fight because you may
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:31.320]  next month want to buy a firearm to protect you and your family

[3:18:35.880 --> 3:18:40.920]  county that they had two deputies on graveyard shift
[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:44.840]  and they had a major uh um state route going through
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:48.040]  if you have a serious accident they're going to be tied up and if you have a

[3:19:08.760 --> 3:19:13.800]  well um it's wrong i mean it's it's totally illegal
[3:19:13.800 --> 3:19:17.720]  but we see this going on in every facet of

[3:22:18.840 --> 3:22:22.840]  that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus
[3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:26.600]  package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value

[3:26:20.760 --> 3:26:25.080]  um i'm a law enforcement officer and i love the guys and gals i work with the
[3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:29.080]  profession is great but we're there to supplement
[3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:33.000]  the the citizens and you're there to respond you're there to enforce the
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:36.760]  law after a crime has been committed under federal and state statute
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:40.440]  you have no liability to protect us because you can't
[3:26:40.440 --> 3:26:45.000]  exactly if something goes down we need a handgun we need a weapon to protect
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:48.920]  yourself at that moment when when our life is threatened we may be
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:52.440]  killed within seconds people think that call 911
[3:26:52.440 --> 3:26:56.600]  is a magic uh genie lamp and the police officer sheriff's deputy is going to
[3:26:56.600 --> 3:26:59.800]  appear there in in seconds it doesn't happen
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:03.640]  again the officer may be across the county they might be uh
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:07.240]  um slowed down with with bad weather you know
[3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:11.080]  police officers have to deal with the vehicle problems and in the weather and
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:15.720]  snow and rain fog your phone may be out how many phone calls have we heard
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:19.080]  where the dispatch systems having problems or the dispatcher
[3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:23.160]  doesn't take them seriously and they get killed the average times what 12 minutes
[3:27:23.160 --> 3:27:27.240]  for a 911 call exactly so you know
[3:27:27.240 --> 3:27:31.960]  we can't is the government going to have a higher bodyguard for every
[3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:34.760]  uh citizen in the country to protect ourselves
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:37.640]  at the moment that we need it that's not going to happen
[3:27:37.640 --> 3:27:41.560]  you know we had founding fathers that guaranteed
[3:27:41.560 --> 3:27:45.560]  the god given right our right to protect ourselves as god given
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:49.560]  but it's backed up by the constitution to be guaranteed by the founding fathers
[3:27:49.560 --> 3:27:52.680]  and the constitution that they rock obama and his
[3:27:52.680 --> 3:27:57.240]  crew of scum to have no authorization to take our guns going back
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:28:02.040]  to darwin bettiker darwin again what do you think of my idea
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:07.640]  of uh of not following this color of law intimidation
[3:28:07.640 --> 3:28:11.480]  and then if they do take your show away from you you've got lawsuits that are
[3:28:11.480 --> 3:28:13.960]  incredible i mean because it's going to kill your show
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:18.280]  anyways going along with this absolutely and like i said i'll

[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:00.440]  but what made me feel good was he said that he wished uh he wished his son
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:03.880]  would have turned out like me which actually made me feel good for all
[3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:06.600]  those people that have been all the hate email thinking it was you know

[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:24.760]  if we use the gun shows as political centers
[3:35:24.760 --> 3:35:29.160]  of the declaration of independence and liberty and got people organized to
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:33.080]  defend local gun rights on a city and county basis

[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:14.920]  why because folks they're openly announcing an
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:18.280]  end to free speech and into everything it's all
[3:37:18.280 --> 3:37:22.360]  happening we've been completely robbed they go intimidate people into posting
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:26.440]  notices saying you can't sell guns at this gun show in private sales
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:29.480]  we've beaten it we've beaten it at the legislature
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:32.920]  so now they're trying to go around it
[3:37:34.280 --> 3:37:38.040]  this andrew uh perkel i mean he told you he was a veteran
[3:37:38.040 --> 3:37:41.720]  austin police officer he didn't say matter he just better used to work for
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:46.200]  the force well it may be another andrew perkel there's
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:51.000]  another one in the austin chronicle give me a close shot of this please
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:55.800]  uh and it says austin chronicle which is a questionable source but no i mean not
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:59.720]  on issues like this a travis county grand jury indicted december
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:04.680]  27th 14-year veteran of the apd detective andrew perkel
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:08.040]  on one count of attempted sexual assault in the third degree felony
[3:38:08.040 --> 3:38:11.560]  one count of public lewdness a class a misdemeanor and one count of indecent
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:15.240]  exposure a class v misdemeanor in connection with the september 15th
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:18.760]  off-duty incident according to a statement released by the apd
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:23.080]  reportedly the alleged offense took place at a hair removal business
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:27.320]  american laser center and involved an encounter between
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:31.160]  perkel and a ajana named laser center employee
[3:38:31.160 --> 3:38:36.760]  perkel's attorney chris gunter told the statesman that the charges were not
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:39.240]  true that everything that transpired between the two people
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:43.560]  was consensual and that he had his client
[3:38:43.560 --> 3:38:47.320]  are anxious for a trial so we need to look and see how that ended up
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:50.680]  but i wonder if they're trying to use that against him to as the manager of
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:53.560]  the event center maybe it's another andrew perkel who was a
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:58.440]  apd person maybe we'll have to check into that interesting info huh
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:02.440]  yeah definitely
[3:39:05.080 --> 3:39:08.920]  well the other thing the other thing that i was gonna mention uh before that
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:12.520]  i uh i really appreciate you know everybody coming in saying that

[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:40.280]  willing to do that well i appreciate that i guess it
[3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:45.960]  was 2000 and they were gonna pass the end of
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:48.760]  the gun show loophole that you know that's like it's a loophole it's illegal
[3:39:48.760 --> 3:39:53.880]  it's not everything's perception and it was gonna pass and i went down
[3:39:53.880 --> 3:39:56.440]  and i got a couple hundred of my listeners and they said you know what

[3:40:31.560 --> 3:40:35.080]  you've got a video camera get out here and like in a movie
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:38.520]  this smith guy who's with the violence policy center and handgun control
[3:40:38.520 --> 3:40:45.560]  incorporated was going 100 200 300 and that video was all over the
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:49.480]  web crashed our servers and i've tried to find our original tapes of it and i
[3:40:49.480 --> 3:40:51.720]  think somebody did find it about a year ago
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:55.240]  guys google bribery caught at texas capital alex jones
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:40:59.080]  and so i run up with the camera and he goes ah an axol suspicious and then
[3:40:59.080 --> 3:41:02.680]  it turned out the committee got in trouble for paid testimony and all this
[3:41:02.680 --> 3:41:06.520]  stuff and we barely beat the bill but the
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:10.120]  inna and it would have banned grandpa's given their grandsons of 22 no private
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:15.000]  gifts no transfers of firearms and that and when i really found out that the
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:19.240]  and then later i saw the documents that the uh nra is actually an anti-gun
[3:41:19.240 --> 3:41:22.280]  group and that charleston heston who i was a
[3:41:22.280 --> 3:41:26.680]  fan of an interviewed was hired in 68 to do tv ads saying
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:30.040]  we need the 68 gun control act people didn't know that
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:33.480]  and he later you said that was wrong to do but the point is
[3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:38.520]  that that their board is run if we're going to get our guns they can't let
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:41.480]  us have a group with you know 10 million members or whatever
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:45.720]  they've got to have it controlled and they called me an extremist and said the
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:50.040]  bill was good at the dallas morning news to ban gun shows
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:55.160]  so and ban jr shooting sports but the point is i have to always march down
[3:41:55.160 --> 3:41:57.560]  and defeat this myself with the help of my listeners
[3:41:57.560 --> 3:42:01.880]  and anybody else out there can start fighting this and catching it
[3:42:01.880 --> 3:42:05.400]  i mean it just takes the willingness to resist these people and people are
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:07.960]  scared of the batf i mean they burned down churches
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:11.640]  but you know what you've got to stand up against them they can't
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:15.800]  stop us all and so you're saying hundreds of people said this was the show to
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:20.280]  get on absolutely that's why other people other
[3:42:20.280 --> 3:42:23.880]  people have called me and and and you know they want to do interviews and
[3:42:23.880 --> 3:42:27.960]  stuff too but uh once i mean once i found out that you were interested in it i
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:32.440]  wanted to make sure that you got the uh you got the full details first
[3:42:32.440 --> 3:42:35.320]  well sir i appreciate you i'm not tuning my horn i'm talking about
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:40.680]  the power of our listeners and and do as many interviews as you can
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:44.760]  and just bullet point you know i mean this is racketeering
[3:42:44.760 --> 3:42:49.640]  i mean i mean this is slimy like out of communist china
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:55.400]  let's talk to kenneth in indiana we already talked to kenneth that i keep
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:42:58.520]  calling keith keith that i keep calling kenneth i i'm looking at a screen way
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:43:01.560]  across the room i mean i may be losing my eyesight here
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:05.960]  is uh rick in tennessee you're on the air go ahead
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:09.640]  hey alex how you doing i'm i'm pretty freaked out that i'm glad people are
[3:43:09.640 --> 3:43:12.200]  rallying against this i mean this is unprecedented
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:17.240]  yeah i have a couple quick comments and a big question for you first of all
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:21.080]  um one of my local gun dealers here in tennessee was at that show i can't get
[3:43:21.080 --> 3:43:24.600]  old of him today because of the holiday so i will get old of him first thing in
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:27.640]  the morning and try to have him contact you
[3:43:27.640 --> 3:43:31.640]  second of all i think we have a duty to debrief and re-educate the citizens of
[3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:35.720]  the united states because we're being micro managed so much
[3:43:35.720 --> 3:43:42.360]  that it's going to start with guns cps um bows knives etc oh they've announced
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:46.200]  all all u.s citizens will have three yearly cps visits
[3:43:46.200 --> 3:43:49.720]  all head start people to put their kids in it get three cps visits
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:53.320]  guilty until briven innocent i mean it is an iron curtain of tyranny well i had a
[3:43:53.320 --> 3:43:56.360]  run in with cps here about a month ago and once i went into their office and
[3:43:56.360 --> 3:44:00.440]  started to record the conversation things changed and then the fact that uh
[3:44:00.440 --> 3:44:02.760]  they wanted to see my children or whatnot and i started courting
[3:44:02.760 --> 3:44:06.280]  constitutional uh right you know you can't you know it's a violation of my
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:09.160]  first amendment fourth amendment fifth amendment they moved on to an easier
[3:44:09.160 --> 3:44:12.920]  target they haven't contacted me since and they went on to find somebody else's
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:16.120]  kids they can write my children in school and by the way at least half of
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:21.400]  march out rapist but go ahead right um now my main question is is um how do we
[3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:25.960]  rally around our sheriff to get him behind us because the sheriff you educate
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:29.880]  him and if they're not a constitutionalist and they're a lapdog of the feds
[3:44:29.880 --> 3:44:34.600]  you run somebody for sheriff and you take your county over and kick the feds out
[3:44:34.600 --> 3:44:37.880]  all right and my final comment would be this that as the united states we are
[3:44:37.880 --> 3:44:41.880]  the last beacon of hope for democracy in this in this world that we live in and
[3:44:41.880 --> 3:44:44.440]  a lot of countries are actually looking at us right now with everything that's
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:48.600]  going on and if we lose our fight for our constitution
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:52.120]  our bill of rights and our god given rights then basically the entire world
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:57.560]  is going to suffer for this rick great point and and again
[3:44:57.560 --> 3:45:01.640]  all over the world china africa all these different countries and continents
[3:45:01.640 --> 3:45:05.960]  and regions are saying torture is okay secret arrest is okay because they say
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:10.200]  hey america does it we've now become a beacon of wickedness
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:13.160]  and it's because the people have sat on their big fat
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:18.680]  behinds and that needs to stop folks let's talk to mike and wyoming you're on the year
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:21.880]  with darwin uh medica go ahead
[3:45:21.880 --> 3:45:26.040]  uh you know i'm sympathetic towards this young man i i remember what it was
[3:45:26.040 --> 3:45:29.000]  like to be that age and and be confronted with the
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:33.320]  with the several guys with the shiny badges and and guns
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:37.080]  uh but uh a little education will empower you
[3:45:37.080 --> 3:45:40.360]  first first off you just need to understand that these guys
[3:45:40.360 --> 3:45:44.200]  uh no matter how many there are how many badges they have
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:47.800]  they're our employees and you have to think of them as such
[3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:51.160]  well let me just interrupt mike as i always do i would have said
[3:45:51.160 --> 3:45:54.920]  i would have punted i would have said i got to get my constitutional lawyer on
[3:45:54.920 --> 3:45:59.320]  this uh this is torturous interference to the h e b guy
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:03.400]  yeah i wouldn't even shown up yep go ahead actually i actually can't hear the
[3:46:03.400 --> 3:46:07.240]  other audio that's going on right now so i don't know if they said
[3:46:07.240 --> 3:46:11.880]  okay uh can you hear the caller now no i can hear you i can't hear the call
[3:46:11.880 --> 3:46:14.040]  can you mike might go ahead and talk again
[3:46:14.040 --> 3:46:18.200]  all right uh can you hear him now yeah i can hear him now
[3:46:18.200 --> 3:46:22.440]  okay now the the first thing that should have come out of your mouth was
[3:46:22.440 --> 3:46:27.880]  uh what is your statutory authority or for telling me i have to do this or
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:33.240]  telling me i can't do doesn't such uh most of these guys under operate under
[3:46:33.240 --> 3:46:35.720]  color of law and they won't be able to tell you
[3:46:35.720 --> 3:46:40.120]  that and uh when they can't cite any of any law
[3:46:40.120 --> 3:46:46.680]  you tell them uh then please uh leave my property leave this building whatever
[3:46:46.680 --> 3:46:50.600]  uh or i will uh call and have you arrested for trespassing
[3:46:50.600 --> 3:46:53.880]  what about letting them in how do these guys always force their
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:46:58.680]  their stouts into these events well i know as far as my show they didn't even
[3:46:58.680 --> 3:47:01.560]  enter through the front door they came in they came into a side door
[3:47:01.560 --> 3:47:03.720]  they don't even ask they just come right in
[3:47:03.720 --> 3:47:07.400]  yeah exactly but america america you need to have security there
[3:47:07.400 --> 3:47:11.240]  to keep their butts out of there and and and uh
[3:47:11.240 --> 3:47:14.520]  you know i hire your own off duty cop for the front door
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:17.880]  you need to throw their butts out they don't have a warrant
[3:47:17.880 --> 3:47:21.560]  yeah no i absolutely absolutely well i just for as small as our show
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:24.920]  let's see no i know put up in all the gun shows let them do this
[3:47:24.920 --> 3:47:28.760]  it's like somebody coming in your house squatting on you and then urinating on
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:31.000]  you and telling you that they're your god i mean
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:34.200]  mike go ahead yeah uh people need to get
[3:47:34.200 --> 3:47:37.320]  get back together in little groups and study the law which is up which i did
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:41.800]  some years ago down in arizona uh institute on the constitution they
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:45.080]  have good dvds on the uh on saying the constitution
[3:47:45.080 --> 3:47:52.120]  that's iotconline.com and for studying just statutory law and civil law
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:57.480]  uh you can't get any better than uh mike brown group called urwin rommel
[3:47:57.480 --> 3:48:00.520]  school of law which is at the rommel law
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:05.400]  rommelaw.com and let me ask your question mike
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:10.760]  why do you think they're getting so bold to just to engage in absolutely mafia
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:15.000]  operations well they're they're they're trying to push
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.400]  us into the confrontation obviously they're uh
[3:48:17.400 --> 3:48:22.120]  they know they're going to find someone who you know who's on the edge and
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:27.160]  uh you know if they can provoke us into violence uh they win as as we all know
[3:48:27.160 --> 3:48:30.680]  so uh but you know we've got to uh stay cool
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:35.160]  and uh and use the law it's still on our side but i don't think the average
[3:48:35.160 --> 3:48:38.360]  cop or fed realizes that when the dam breaks which they're sitting there
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:42.520]  trying to do what's gonna happen yeah i can't they think we're
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:46.440]  wimps because people don't go absolutely wild do they have any idea
[3:48:46.440 --> 3:48:51.000]  what people want to do yeah well there are a lot of people who want to die
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:56.040]  and want to take a bunch of people with them who are just sick of all the crap
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:48:59.240]  yeah they should they should know that they're being set up and uh just use
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:02.920]  this cannon fodder but that that the thing the phrase you
[3:49:02.920 --> 3:49:06.280]  need to remember everyone needs to remember is what is your statutory
[3:49:06.280 --> 3:49:10.040]  authority just just commit that to memory yeah and all my babbling yeah
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:15.160]  no law no regulation no nothing just make it up
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:18.200]  but mike you heard how they were trying to be careful but they weren't
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:21.560]  careful i mean they were trying to just intimidate this whole thing in the
[3:49:21.560 --> 3:49:24.760]  in the process yeah they were very careful not to put anything on
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:28.200]  on in writing uh but you i'm sure you have
[3:49:28.200 --> 3:49:31.800]  funny witnesses now and uh you know a title 42
[3:49:31.800 --> 3:49:35.240]  1983 was i think was taylor made and take these guys
[3:49:35.240 --> 3:49:40.920]  individually into court and uh they won't be pulling this again
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:45.240]  well i mean that's the action well look they obviously put this former austin
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:48.920]  cop and it looks like it's the same guy who was indicted we don't know if he
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:52.360]  was convicted convicted for attempted sexual assault
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:56.280]  he suddenly he's off the force now so i mean he left for some reason
[3:49:56.280 --> 3:49:59.560]  in 2006 suddenly he's over the event center
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:04.680]  then the stings start getting run setting up the old people so they left
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:08.440]  the sacks it i think there's a whole conspiracy here the more we borrow into
[3:50:08.440 --> 3:50:12.680]  this yeah i think it certainly sounds like it but
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:16.440]  you know that guy could be guilty of uh impersonating an officer
[3:50:16.440 --> 3:50:21.400]  if he's the one you you're thinking of uh but whether you want to call this
[3:50:21.400 --> 3:50:25.320]  conspiracy or not that's that's a tough uh no no no you're missing what i'm
[3:50:25.320 --> 3:50:28.440]  saying the the the the chronicle has a name of an
[3:50:28.440 --> 3:50:32.920]  austin police officer that matches andrew uh perkel
[3:50:32.920 --> 3:50:36.840]  that's the name of the the former cop that said i'm former apd
[3:50:36.840 --> 3:50:41.720]  that manages the event center who had him there at the meeting
[3:50:41.720 --> 3:50:46.040]  with all this happening and so it looks like he went there in the last few
[3:50:46.040 --> 3:50:49.080]  years that's when they shut down the last gun show
[3:50:49.080 --> 3:50:52.520]  looks like they've got an inside man in there who they've got
[3:50:52.520 --> 3:50:56.120]  control over in control of the event center to run
[3:50:56.120 --> 3:50:59.880]  ops against gun shows you understand
[3:50:59.880 --> 3:51:02.920]  yeah you understand we'll be right back stay with it
[3:51:02.920 --> 3:51:07.000]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:10.120]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[3:51:10.120 --> 3:51:14.200]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:17.400]  americans at home i have a tremendous influence
[3:51:17.400 --> 3:51:21.400]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:51:21.400 --> 3:51:26.680]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:51:26.680 --> 3:51:30.600]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[3:51:30.600 --> 3:51:34.280]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty

[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:41.320]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[3:51:41.320 --> 3:51:45.160]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[3:51:45.160 --> 3:51:48.680]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[3:51:48.680 --> 3:51:52.520]  a fall of the republic get your copy of full of the republic
