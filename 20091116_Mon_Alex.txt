[00:37.560 --> 00:46.560]  joins us in the third hour he was on CNBC a week ago warning that world
[00:46.560 --> 00:55.560]  government is being established and we he heads up a major financial firm so
[00:55.560 --> 01:04.000]  we're gonna be talking to him coming up later in the radio broadcast daemon
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.440]  vickers we look forward to that I'm also working on Webster Tarpley I just told
[01:13.440 --> 01:16.440]  my producer to get him on this morning because he's written an amazing
[01:16.440 --> 01:22.880]  analysis that he sent to us to post at info wars dot com titled major hassan
[01:22.880 --> 01:29.760]  afford hood a patsy and a drill gone live question mark so we'll be covering
[01:29.760 --> 01:37.320]  that to either way whether he joins us or not today some of the other vitally
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.120]  important news in front of me dollar falls sending gold record high one
[01:44.120 --> 01:50.520]  thousand one hundred and thirty-three dollars and twenty cents an ounce and the
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.520]  dollar fell to a record low
[01:55.760 --> 02:01.440]  retail sales show gain of course a little game we're going into the
[02:01.440 --> 02:06.440]  christmas season holiday season but manufacturing gauge slips we're importing
[02:06.440 --> 02:10.960]  it so it doesn't matter of the dollars weakening that's supposed to increase
[02:10.960 --> 02:17.360]  manufacturing there is no manufacturing and that's not helped by the fact I
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.280]  saw this last night I watched part of Obama's speech that was blacked out in
[02:22.280 --> 02:27.320]  China Chinese government wouldn't broadcast his speech to university
[02:27.320 --> 02:32.440]  students handpicked communist party members by the way but White House dot
[02:32.440 --> 02:38.160]  gov does have it and in the speech he said that China has better roads and
[02:38.160 --> 02:41.920]  better trains and better industry and that everybody wants to move there he
[02:41.920 --> 02:50.560]  badmouthed America you see a lot of what the US is is an image in the world and
[02:50.560 --> 02:56.760]  so the elite are signifying the end of this country and then I get to hear
[02:56.760 --> 03:00.880]  neocons like Laura Ingraham driving into work this morning blaming it on the
[03:00.880 --> 03:05.600]  democrats and and and saying she's been fighting globalism and fighting the big
[03:05.600 --> 03:09.880]  banks I mean unbelievable when both parties are bought and paid for by the
[03:09.880 --> 03:13.720]  same interest and these people didn't say a word about China when Bush was in
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.280]  office and as soon as a republicans back in office they'll get back on board
[03:18.280 --> 03:26.080]  with the whole globalist agenda watching their sliminess I mean I don't like the
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.880]  democrats obviously their globalists through and through but at least they
[03:30.880 --> 03:33.720]  admit they don't like this country at least they admit they want to bring
[03:33.720 --> 03:37.000]  this country down at least they admit they want to make everybody dependent on
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.120]  government there's nothing worse than the republicans who run around posing as
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.400]  if they're not for dependence and collectivism makes me sick they really
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.080]  make me want to throw up meanwhile Lou Dobbs because he was the real deal and
[03:52.080 --> 03:57.360]  was non-partisan and exposed the North American Union he's gone
[03:59.840 --> 04:04.800]  all right I'm starting to rant world leaders back delay to final climate
[04:04.800 --> 04:12.680]  deal that's a ruse out of Reuters Obama branded groveler in chief that's the
[04:12.680 --> 04:18.000]  mail online branded groveler in chief after deep bow to emperor son of
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.480]  Japanese ruler who authorized Pearl Harbor attack and the British newspaper
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.480]  as well as Canadian papers show how no American president has ever bowed to
[04:27.480 --> 04:30.880]  this guy they show photos and videos of past presidents meeting with him
[04:30.880 --> 04:39.160]  Obama didn't just do the polite Japanese bow he did the servant bow that a
[04:39.160 --> 04:44.960]  servant or an employee of someone does a full bow similar to a theater bow and
[04:44.960 --> 04:51.080]  in Shakespearean thespian tradition theatrical tradition so we'll talk
[04:51.080 --> 04:56.240]  about that why is he doing this gore's getting protested everywhere he goes

[08:10.400 --> 08:17.320]  the United States is in the final phases of being completely collapsed this is
[08:17.320 --> 08:22.880]  going to be hard on everyone including even the wealthy the new bow reach bought
[08:22.880 --> 08:27.200]  into globalism in the last 50 years is trendy and cool we have now been
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.960]  completely deindustrialized we are no longer an industrial country we rate
[08:31.960 --> 08:37.520]  industrially like a third-world nation the president is now running around all
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.440]  over China and the United States in Europe bad-mouthing our industry and
[08:41.440 --> 08:47.600]  our country is not a good place to invest by design the globalist have bragged
[08:47.600 --> 08:52.280]  morey strong and countless others that the plan starting in the 40s was to
[08:52.280 --> 08:58.040]  deindustrialize the United States and then have a balance of power globally
[08:58.040 --> 09:05.040]  where only the central banks have control and we're now being told all over
[09:05.040 --> 09:10.840]  the news we have to do what China says China is our boss China is the new
[09:10.840 --> 09:16.360]  superpower America is a thing of the past we're being told to be
[09:16.360 --> 09:20.440]  unconfident we're being told that we deserve what's happening we're being
[09:20.440 --> 09:24.360]  told that only the United States and Western Europe Canada Australia New
[09:24.360 --> 09:29.120]  Zealand will have to implement the carbon taxes that will fully destroy the
[09:29.120 --> 09:37.080]  remnants the wreckage of our industry I want to play you a clip now watching his
[09:37.080 --> 09:41.240]  speech and his question and answer from China and seeing another speech he gave
[09:41.240 --> 09:47.560]  in Japan he's saying similar things but this is what Obama said back in August
[09:47.560 --> 09:54.240]  in the United States so this is a talking point that President Obama puts
[09:54.240 --> 10:00.360]  out letting us know and then he twist it and says go along with his agenda the
[10:00.360 --> 10:06.320]  globalist agenda of cap and trade or we won't get our industry when the cap and
[10:06.320 --> 10:12.000]  trade program which is just one part of the taxation flotilla Armada hitting us
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.280]  right now will fully destroy the the last remnants that we've got left and
[10:19.280 --> 10:26.320]  then the police state's going to unfold on the sectors that are still intact
[10:26.320 --> 10:32.240]  beaching everyone on the floating wreckage of government all that is meant
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.440]  to be left is government so we can hand over what's left of our economy the
[10:36.440 --> 10:40.280]  private offshore corporations to destroy our economy and vertically
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.680]  integrated under globalist control it must be fully imploded both parties are
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.800]  involved the only major Republicans speaking out against this are Michelle
[10:51.800 --> 10:57.600]  Bachman and of course Congressman Ron Paul Louis Gomer and a few others here
[10:57.600 --> 11:02.240]  it is here's Barack Obama everybody's watching what's going on in Beijing right
[11:02.240 --> 11:06.040]  now in the Olympics think about the amount of money that China has spent on
[11:06.040 --> 11:12.080]  infrastructure their ports their train systems their airports are all
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.880]  vastly superior to us now which means if you're a corporation decide and where
[11:16.880 --> 11:22.400]  to do business you're starting to think Beijing looks like a pretty good
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.200]  option why aren't we doing the same thing well because globalist Henry
[11:29.200 --> 11:35.080]  Kissinger and George Schultz and David Rockefeller run the United States I mean
[11:35.080 --> 11:39.520]  you know full well why that's happening President Obama you got to love these
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.320]  people they create the crises they create the banking implosion they
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.200]  implement the tax exemptions for corporations to leave the United States
[11:48.200 --> 11:53.400]  and then they run around grandstanding in the aftermath of globalization and say
[11:53.400 --> 12:00.000]  the answer is more globalization and for the feds to give the state some of
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.240]  their money back for a highway program you have to agree to make it a toll
[12:03.240 --> 12:08.880]  road taxpayers pay for the roads 8,000 miles of them in Texas and then they
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.560]  just hand them over to foreign corporations like central of Spain and
[12:13.560 --> 12:21.480]  then local papers all over Texas attack me Alex Jones by name and Ron Paul and
[12:21.480 --> 12:27.600]  say we're conspiracy theorist that the highways even exist yes national news
[12:27.600 --> 12:32.280]  Fox CNN I have the video clips we played them where they say there is no
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.000]  trans-Texas corridor there are no super NAFTA highways being built and old
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.400]  roads being taken over and new roads being set up under their control but the
[12:41.400 --> 12:45.120]  Austin Chronicle writes multiple articles calling me a conspiracy theorist
[12:45.120 --> 12:52.680]  saying that centra isn't Spanish think of the magnitude of the lying of these
[12:52.680 --> 12:58.640]  people how dumb they think you are how stupid they think you are the unlimited
[12:58.640 --> 13:05.640]  unrivaled in human history lying saying polar bears can't swim that the ice
[13:05.640 --> 13:10.400]  packs are all melting total lies saying carbon dioxide is a deadly poison
[13:10.400 --> 13:20.520]  total lies everything is a complete over-the-top filthy lie I remember three
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.280]  years ago Al Gore would testify in Congress and say that he's making no
[13:24.280 --> 13:28.960]  money off of all of his environmental initiatives that are environmental in
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.160]  name only now he goes around saying I'm proud of it of course I make money off
[13:33.160 --> 13:37.360]  of it we have those clips the old clips of him saying he's not doing it with the
[13:37.360 --> 13:43.560]  new clips of him admitting it see see they deny deny deny deny deny deny deny
[13:43.560 --> 13:47.200]  deny deny while they're building it and setting it up and now that they've
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.160]  completely destroyed us and overrun us they're going yeah of course I'm making
[13:51.160 --> 13:54.640]  money of course you're going to pay your taxes to my private carbon trading
[13:54.640 --> 14:09.760]  organization I'm going to go over all of this today I'm going to cover all of it
[14:09.760 --> 14:17.080]  we're going to talk to Heather Colin Ian Steven the Lila and many others the
[14:17.080 --> 14:24.560]  toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 and then later in
[14:24.560 --> 14:29.160]  the broadcast I want to go over dollar faults and then go to record high retail
[14:29.160 --> 14:35.240]  sales show game but manufacturing gauge slips world leaders back delay to final
[14:35.240 --> 14:41.320]  climate deal that's propaganda Obama branded groveler in chief after deep
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.720]  bow to emperor son of Japanese ruler who authorized Pearl Harbor attack well of
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.360]  course and he bowed to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and I don't mean just a
[14:50.360 --> 14:59.360]  little bow I mean a full flat-out bow where he was right along with the floor
[14:59.360 --> 15:07.000]  complete bow you know the theater bow like actors do at the end of a play the
[15:07.000 --> 15:13.080]  good news is everywhere Al Gore goes we have listeners calling us everywhere he
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.680]  goes our listeners call into the radio show they plug where he's going to be in
[15:16.680 --> 15:21.320]  a week and here's the Palm Beach post Gore's presentation on climate change
[15:21.320 --> 15:27.080]  draws 800 as 200 protesters gather outside and guess what happened a third
[15:27.080 --> 15:31.920]  of the article is quotes from the protesters you see now he doesn't just
[15:31.920 --> 15:37.520]  to go get TV and newspaper coverage without the truth being injected then
[15:37.520 --> 15:43.720]  it says in the article cap and trade don't be fooled Al Gore will make
[15:43.720 --> 15:48.840]  billions read us read a sign carried by Alan Tudor who drove from Tampa to attend
[15:48.840 --> 15:53.280]  Saturday's protest the article goes on to admit Al Gore's making billions off
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.520]  of it Gore's favorite green product another sign read your money in his
[15:58.520 --> 16:03.840]  pocket that's a good one Gore's favorite green product your money in his
[16:03.840 --> 16:11.360]  pocket Gore spokesman Kaleen Crider said goers investments are consistent with
[16:11.360 --> 16:15.280]  positions he has held for decades all see they got a respond to that now
[16:15.280 --> 16:20.640]  because we're the American people true patriots from across the political
[16:20.640 --> 16:24.440]  spectrum are waking up and going out and confronting this bastard and the
[16:24.440 --> 16:31.400]  crowds are going to get bigger and bigger remember five six months ago it
[16:31.400 --> 16:36.080]  didn't matter if it was Rick Perry the Republican governor of Texas or whether
[16:36.080 --> 16:39.600]  it was Congressman Lloyd dog at the Democrat congressman from South Texas
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.960]  everywhere they went they got booed because they're pro NAFTA highway pro
[16:43.960 --> 16:48.520]  globalism pro government health care Perry now is trying to talk like he's
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.800]  Ron Paul or Alex Jones no I think Obama's a socialist I'm against this new
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.860]  world order we might need to succeed it's all election rhetoric he's a
[16:58.860 --> 17:02.520]  Bilderberg attendee the person he's running against K. Belly Hutchinson is a
[17:02.520 --> 17:08.560]  Bilderberg steering committee member but remember what happened they use that
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.860]  same military tactic of denial the national news reported this is all
[17:14.860 --> 17:21.720]  staged lobbyist bust in Republicans to protest Lloyd dogged but we had listeners
[17:21.720 --> 17:26.200]  who happened to be there happened to be at the grocery store at this one event
[17:26.200 --> 17:30.200]  and they reported in fact my next door neighbor reported actually two doors down
[17:30.200 --> 17:33.520]  that he was there but just buying food with his kids and heard booing and
[17:33.520 --> 17:39.240]  hissing and that it was the entire crowd and then it was spontaneous he only
[17:39.240 --> 17:43.920]  sent letters out to Democrats Lloyd dogged did to come to the grocery store
[17:43.920 --> 17:49.000]  to come to the Randalls right over in the same neighborhood where I used to live
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.680]  in South Austin but what are the national news say they said oh it was all
[17:54.680 --> 17:58.560]  staged oh this is all staged and then a month later they had to admit okay it's
[17:58.560 --> 18:02.840]  not staged see because you're not allowed to go out and protest in you're not
[18:02.840 --> 18:08.920]  allowed to go to a town hall meeting and tell a legislator that you don't agree
[18:08.920 --> 18:12.760]  with them no no that's impossible that's a conspiracy theory no one
[18:12.760 --> 18:16.320]  disagrees with big government no one disagrees with corruption no one
[18:16.320 --> 18:22.040]  disagrees with NAFTA and get and it started out with a few hundred people
[18:22.040 --> 18:28.720]  mainly in Austin where did the Tea Party start 9-11 truth in Boston mass and
[18:28.720 --> 18:35.360]  9-11 truth in Austin Texas five years ago then Ron Paul picked up on it three
[18:35.360 --> 18:39.840]  years ago and the Republicans waltzed right in in the last year and took over
[18:39.840 --> 18:45.520]  our movement just like that but it doesn't matter our people are now in that
[18:45.520 --> 18:50.680]  movement educating from the inside out the issue here though is people are
[18:50.680 --> 18:56.400]  waking up people are taking action there are hundreds of videos on YouTube of
[18:56.400 --> 19:03.520]  people confronting Al Gore remember what we are changed her to doing at my
[19:04.080 --> 19:10.240]  recommendation two years ago Luke Radowski that idea of confronting
[19:10.240 --> 19:13.920]  Republicans and Democrats against globalization going out and confronting
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.440]  those that are for it people against it going out and confronting them now it's
[19:18.440 --> 19:22.400]  spread to second amendment groups it's spread to land rights activists it's
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.400]  spread to national sovereignty activists and anti-globalist activism and now
[19:27.400 --> 19:31.400]  instead of just having big marches that everybody ignores there's thousands
[19:31.400 --> 19:35.200]  every week of little gatherings of hundreds and now they're going to
[19:35.200 --> 19:41.720]  thousands spontaneous flash mobs as the Pentagon calls them where we go into
[19:41.720 --> 19:45.920]  their events at city councils county commissioners state houses you name it
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.840]  and take them over and shatter the illusion that the people are going along
[19:49.840 --> 19:55.360]  with this I salute those out there confronting this pig Al Gore this
[19:55.360 --> 19:59.520]  criminal piece of trash will be right back

[24:31.080 --> 24:36.600]  your calls are coming up in the next segment 1-800-259-9231 I wanted to just
[24:36.600 --> 24:46.760]  add an observation I drove to East Texas to take my son and daughter deer
[24:46.760 --> 24:55.080]  hunting Friday and Saturday and I have never seen more state police more local
[24:55.080 --> 25:01.320]  police every side road every small road every highway every five miles the
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.560]  police outriding tickets you know they've tripled the number of police more
[25:04.560 --> 25:09.200]  than triple in the last decade and they're there to revenue generate ladies
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.600]  and gentlemen and that's only one indicator of all the new taxes and all
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.400]  the new regulations and the increases in taxes across the board take Travis
[25:19.400 --> 25:29.560]  County where I live the housing markets easily down by 30% my property tax the
[25:29.560 --> 25:35.800]  rent I pay to the government my property tax went up this year it went up
[25:35.800 --> 25:42.160]  several thousand dollars it went up substantively so my house is worth
[25:42.160 --> 25:47.000]  probably 20% in the neighborhood I'm in 20% less than it was two years ago they
[25:47.000 --> 25:54.680]  don't care I got a tax bill over 20% bigger total fraud and most people don't
[25:54.680 --> 25:57.400]  even know how to challenge their property tax I know how to challenge it
[25:57.400 --> 26:03.000]  and get it reduced under law but I don't have the time I don't have the time
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.720]  it's arduous it takes time and I heard a local real estate show in Austin
[26:08.720 --> 26:12.840]  reporting yesterday that for the first time ever the county is the Travis
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.480]  County is just ignoring many of them and just saying we've got a backlog so
[26:17.480 --> 26:24.600]  therefore we're going to try to make you pay the globalist are cutthroats they
[26:24.600 --> 26:28.920]  don't care they're going to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and pick the bones
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.600]  of this nation California is putting taxes on television sets for the
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.680]  environment taxes on light bulbs satellite tracker boxes in the cars
[26:37.680 --> 26:43.120]  taxes on ammunition California is the model of the rest of the country other
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.720]  states are trying to pass environmental laws cities like Austin are passing
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.080]  carbon tax laws it's already happening with or without the Copenhagen treaty
[26:51.080 --> 26:56.160]  with or without the bill that they're set to pass in the next two weeks in the
[26:56.160 --> 27:01.040]  US Senate which will implement the Copenhagen treaty here without the
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.920]  treaty even being signed yet they're set to bring it to the full floor tomorrow
[27:05.920 --> 27:10.880]  to take over health care 17 to 21 percent depending on which index you look
[27:10.880 --> 27:19.920]  at of the US economy one of the few industries we've got left one of the
[27:19.920 --> 27:30.400]  few industries they can't export and then I see articles like this one Army
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.920]  sends infant to protective services mom to Afghanistan out of the Interpress
[27:35.920 --> 27:43.080]  Service out of Ventura, California Army specialist Alexis Hutchinson got
[27:43.080 --> 27:49.560]  pregnant she had the baby they said you don't get to get a deferment now you
[27:49.560 --> 27:56.560]  don't get to have time off CPS took her baby the Army sent the CPS to take her
[27:56.560 --> 28:01.920]  baby her mother doesn't get the baby they said that well it's neglect that you
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.880]  would get pregnant while in the Army so see before when they made women get in
[28:06.880 --> 28:09.880]  the military women sign up for the military now they want to draft for
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.600]  women before they let you out you know you stick men and women together they
[28:14.600 --> 28:17.560]  start having sex they start having babies that's what humans do that's what
[28:17.560 --> 28:23.000]  all mammals do it's what all animals do now they take your baby they take your
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.600]  baby and then say here's an M16 a single mother's being threatened with military
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.560]  court martial if she does not agree to deploy to Afghanistan despite having been
[28:33.560 --> 28:37.400]  told she would be given extra time to find someone to care for 11 month old
[28:37.400 --> 28:44.120]  son while she's overseas she's confined in Hunter Army airfield near Savannah
[28:44.120 --> 28:47.720]  Georgia after being arrested her son was placed in the custody of foster care
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.960]  system that's America the Israelis don't take women's children when they get
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.360]  pregnant the Army the Russians don't take women's children the Russians pay
[28:57.360 --> 29:02.840]  women to have children they're the only country and Russia's got big problems but
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.520]  in Russia because they know they have 1.2 children for every two parents they
[29:07.520 --> 29:13.120]  know they're dying so Russia pays people to have children and lets you out of the
[29:13.120 --> 29:21.320]  military no one in the world arrest women who get pregnant in the Army but
[29:21.320 --> 29:26.360]  America doesn't just arrest you they take your child because we are the most
[29:26.360 --> 29:34.160]  evil wicked nation 51 million butchered babies with abortion isn't enough and
[29:34.160 --> 29:37.200]  they'll take the child and drug it up and run through the system and get lots of
[29:37.200 --> 29:41.560]  money for the foster system this is this is the predatory nature we have

[34:47.120 --> 34:53.400]  guess fantastic incredible overwhelming super super job okay I'm gonna go to your
[34:53.400 --> 35:00.120]  phone calls and then I'm gonna get into Obama bowing down to royalty which no
[35:00.120 --> 35:05.440]  US presidents ever done our country was founded on letting royalty know that we
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.680]  think they're disgusting and filthy and a sick joke old women old men that are
[35:09.680 --> 35:13.920]  corrupt owning empires through oppression wearing gold crowns everyone
[35:13.920 --> 35:22.400]  bowing to them I mean it's just primitive beyond belief and a joke it flies
[35:22.400 --> 35:25.480]  in the face of the Declaration of Independence all men are created equal
[35:25.480 --> 35:29.760]  endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights life liberty the
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.280]  pursuit of happiness that when government becomes destructive of these aims it
[35:33.280 --> 35:37.560]  is our right it is our duty to abolish those forms that we become accustomed
[35:37.560 --> 35:44.240]  to to watch a US president do this is stunning but it's all part of
[35:44.240 --> 35:47.080]  globalization to have the president running around bad-mouthing America
[35:47.080 --> 35:51.160]  that's what he's supposed to do to put down the country the dollar plunging gold
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.080]  exploding to all-time record highs just a huge stack of incredible news we're
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.160]  gonna be covering today and we have a special guest coming up the third hour
[35:58.160 --> 36:03.160]  right now let's go to Heather in Indiana Heather you're on the air hi Alex I
[36:03.160 --> 36:05.960]  was calling to tell you a quick short story and then I just want to get your
[36:05.960 --> 36:11.920]  view on something that we value your opinion about we have four kids we just
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.400]  had our two-year-old in the hospital for pneumonia no other tests came back of
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.640]  course they're trying to run the flu test everything comes back negative she's
[36:20.640 --> 36:24.840]  admitted basically for dehydration because she was so little because we do
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.360]  everything natural at home we do the silver thank god we heard about it on
[36:28.360 --> 36:33.480]  your show I would have never known anything about it and but within minutes
[36:33.480 --> 36:36.840]  of them telling me okay it's pneumonia we're just gonna keep her here for
[36:36.840 --> 36:42.000]  observation everything fine I've got three nurses the pediatrician they've
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.200]  got gowns mask gloves signs outside her door all of a sudden now she's got the
[36:47.200 --> 36:52.120]  swine flu yeah this is the new and it's come out literally hundreds of times in
[36:52.120 --> 36:56.920]  mainstream media that anyone who's sick at the hospital they now say it's swine
[36:56.920 --> 37:01.280]  flu to create hype in the newspaper on TV and then later say oh your child
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.160]  didn't have swine flu then they try to give little bitty babies which you're
[37:06.160 --> 37:10.720]  not supposed to it's on the insert they try to give them in inoculations while
[37:10.720 --> 37:15.120]  they're already sick then that'll make them get sick many times or have seizures
[37:15.120 --> 37:18.960]  then they say it was the original swine flu that did it or they try to give them
[37:18.960 --> 37:21.720]  Tama flu which the inserts admit you're not supposed to give the small
[37:21.720 --> 37:27.400]  children or babies so your baby is there surrounded by these these ring
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.400]  wraiths right now Heather no actually this was about a week and a half ago it
[37:31.400 --> 37:34.520]  takes us forever to try to get on to your show we've been trying to tell you
[37:34.520 --> 37:40.160]  about this but no she's home now she was better within 48 hours like I said we
[37:40.160 --> 37:44.200]  give them the silver when they're sick I do the elderberry I do all natural but
[37:44.200 --> 37:50.080]  was it wasn't the H1N1 no it wasn't the H1N1 it had nothing to do with that she
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.800]  had an act of chest x-ray that had showed that she had pneumonia and all of
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.200]  a sudden it was oh she's got the H1N1 in the complication pneumonia we signed a
[37:59.200 --> 38:04.280]  piece of paper against medical advice to not give her the Tama flu because they
[38:04.280 --> 38:10.000]  were trying to push that on her and she's no I know listen listen I've got
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.720]  employees that have had babies that are just sick so they go to the doctor and
[38:16.720 --> 38:21.360]  they try to say here here's a box of Tama flu that's like a doctor giving you
[38:21.360 --> 38:26.280]  antibiotics without swabbing the infection they have to find out the
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.760]  right antibiotic to even attack certain types of bacteria but they don't care
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.000]  they just give you the antibiotics and it's the same thing with the antivirals
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.440]  and that's what's causing the deadly mutations and now even the Ukrainian
[38:40.440 --> 38:45.640]  government in the Sunday Express is saying that the different anti flu
[38:45.640 --> 38:53.280]  drugs and vaccines have mutated into a super virus this just gets crazier and
[38:53.280 --> 38:58.240]  crazier now what what is crazy is that this is my my youngest daughter had that
[38:58.240 --> 39:02.600]  the flu test they had to run it it was negative and then they want to say well
[39:02.600 --> 39:06.640]  40 to 60 percent of the test come back negative but you've got it anyway now
[39:06.640 --> 39:10.960]  with my eight-year-old well it's a cult it's again it's medical tyranny where
[39:10.960 --> 39:14.240]  they're setting it up where they do whatever they want to you completely
[39:14.240 --> 39:17.160]  understand and I agree with you a hundred percent my eight-year-old who we
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.600]  had to take about five days later same symptoms I'm doing the natural stuff at
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.120]  home but she has asthma and other things that you know with her health so I kind
[39:26.120 --> 39:29.120]  of watch her just a little bit more shouldn't have even have taken her I
[39:29.120 --> 39:33.400]  ended up leaving before the visit was over they didn't even run a test they
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.600]  didn't do anything and all my daughter has was like a creepy cough she kind of
[39:37.600 --> 39:41.640]  gets it throughout the year we know exactly what to do with it the drug
[39:41.640 --> 39:46.040]  companies ma'am have gone and paid off all the major hospitals it's a mainstream
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.000]  news to just push their shots and their drugs even when even when they don't
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.240]  even have flu much less h1n1 they're turning the hospitals into pure
[39:56.240 --> 40:00.720]  snake oil quackery that's exactly what they did with my eight-year-old and they
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.880]  scared her half to death I had to come home and tell her you do not have the h1n1
[40:04.880 --> 40:08.000]  they didn't even do a test on you you have a little cough mommy's gonna take
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.680]  care of it with the silver and the elderberry and we'll we'll get through
[40:10.680 --> 40:13.240]  this by ourselves we don't need medication well the big thing is the
[40:13.240 --> 40:19.720]  vitamin a and d and b and sunshine yes we do vitamin d3 every day my children
[40:19.720 --> 40:23.160]  take the multivitamins we have them on a great regimen but this is what I want
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.800]  to ask you about real quick do you do any research on the vitamin b17 as a
[40:27.800 --> 40:33.640]  deficiency of why people get cancer or the sect we've had a lot of medical
[40:33.640 --> 40:39.240]  doctors on that have talked about the b variants saying that those are very
[40:39.240 --> 40:45.080]  important most of our illnesses in young people are in healthy folks are vitamin
[40:45.080 --> 40:49.200]  and mineral deficiencies because they put fertilizer on the crops that will
[40:49.200 --> 40:54.640]  make the plants grow but they're empty of nutrients and and vitamins and and
[40:54.640 --> 41:00.120]  cofactors and trace elements and so yes I mean I'm not here dispensing medical
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.760]  advice I have medical doctors on who talk about general principles okay well
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.600]  you keep doing what you're doing and we have let everyone that we know watch
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.080]  fall the Republic all of your movies we're keep trying to open everybody's
[41:14.080 --> 41:17.560]  minds that we know so we could get things going on our end because we are
[41:17.560 --> 41:21.200]  big supporters you and appreciate all you do for everybody out there that needs
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.000]  to wake up and understand what's going on thank you so much God bless you but
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.240]  whether it's vitamin a d the b variants called silver nano silver none of it is
[41:32.240 --> 41:37.720]  a silver bullet none of it is perfect healthy food lots of sleep clean water
[41:37.720 --> 41:42.800]  rest low stress there's major studies that's screaming yelling at your children
[41:42.800 --> 41:47.440]  fighting in front of your children that debases their immune system more than
[41:47.440 --> 41:52.280]  anything and so you need to research the vitamins the silver all of it you can
[41:52.280 --> 41:59.960]  overdo that as well I mean any drug whether it's natural or unnatural can
[41:59.960 --> 42:05.160]  have side effects but notice how they're pushing Tamiflu which Japan it's
[42:05.160 --> 42:09.760]  illegal to give this to young children in Japan the inserts of Tamiflu state
[42:09.760 --> 42:15.760]  that it can cause hallucinations depression illness seizures and
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.560]  everyone I know that has children when they just go to the regular doctor
[42:19.560 --> 42:26.160]  they're told take this I'm not gonna say any names but my father went with me
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.880]  rode with my son and my daughter the two oldest to go deer hunting this weekend
[42:30.880 --> 42:40.680]  and a dentist that works under him his son is asthmatic and they gave him the
[42:40.680 --> 42:45.880]  seasonal shot and the H1N1 and he immediately had water go into his lungs
[42:45.880 --> 42:50.920]  within 24 hours he immediately got seriously sick I mean they had to sit and
[42:50.920 --> 42:57.520]  take him into the emergency room and the word came out well it could have been a
[42:57.520 --> 43:02.120]  bad reaction with the flu shot and the doctor the dentist was in denial with my
[43:02.120 --> 43:08.880]  dad so my dad went to John Hopkins online and printed up that the H1N1
[43:08.880 --> 43:13.240]  in the regular seasonal flu shot insert that said do not give it to asthmatics
[43:13.240 --> 43:22.160]  do not give it to asthmatics and the dentist was in denial to my dad look
[43:22.160 --> 43:27.800]  it's the stinking insert and I had a caller Sunday on yesterday's show who
[43:27.800 --> 43:32.480]  called in and said at his university they were given free H1N1 shots out and
[43:32.480 --> 43:39.000]  so he printed off the H1N1 Norvitas printout and he was handing hundreds
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.920]  out and the doctors and nurses came over and heckled him and called him a
[43:42.920 --> 43:47.960]  conspiracy theorist and tried to kick him out of there and laughed at him they
[43:47.960 --> 43:52.360]  were handing out the fake sheets that say there is no mercury cannot cause
[43:52.360 --> 43:57.560]  Guillain-Barre or Gillian-Barre in English cannot cause auto-immunity problems
[43:57.560 --> 44:04.640]  cannot sterilize you they nationwide hand out a lying sheet and then when you
[44:04.640 --> 44:14.120]  come with the insert stating the facts from the drug package you're called a
[44:14.120 --> 44:21.080]  conspiracy theorist just like every day I Google my name Alex Jones and click
[44:21.080 --> 44:25.720]  news and every day there are two three four five mainstream news articles
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.320]  saying I'm insane there's no world government there's no cap and trade
[44:30.320 --> 44:35.840]  there's no police state they're not face scanning you the flu shot doesn't have
[44:35.840 --> 44:45.240]  mercury that shows the elite are not invincible or they wouldn't be attacking
[44:45.240 --> 44:51.680]  little old Alex Jones every stinking day big national publications I will tell
[44:51.680 --> 44:55.200]  you it's creepy though because they are really coming after me folks they are
[44:55.200 --> 44:59.280]  really turning the heat up on old Alex Jones and I need your prayers and
[44:59.280 --> 45:07.640]  support more than ever it is mind-blowing one of the big things that's
[45:07.640 --> 45:13.520]  mind-blowing is to have it come out in mainstream news that top Nazis and top
[45:13.520 --> 45:19.560]  white supremacists are FBI agents I mean it's been in the Boston Globe it's been
[45:19.560 --> 45:24.400]  in the Miami Herald it's been in the Orlando what is it the Sentinel that
[45:24.400 --> 45:31.440]  all these top Nazis like Hal Turner who attacks me mercilessly because when
[45:31.440 --> 45:35.000]  people ask me about him I go he's a disinformation artist and his internal
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.840]  emails got released two years ago that he was indeed a fed and then now it's
[45:38.840 --> 45:44.320]  come out in federal court he is a fed mainstream news why does the government
[45:44.320 --> 45:50.760]  fund fake Nazis to come out and attack me and say that I'm a Jewish agent when
[45:50.760 --> 45:56.400]  I'm not I disagree with a lot of things Israel does and I criticize Israel but
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.440]  I'm not in any semi why does the government want to sick the Nazis on
[46:01.440 --> 46:05.840]  me they're followers because I expose that most Nazi groups around by the
[46:05.840 --> 46:09.480]  feds and I've been proven right think about how creepy that is and then
[46:09.480 --> 46:17.880]  Brett Bart part of the operation run and founded by Matt Drudge is writing
[46:17.880 --> 46:26.160]  articles every couple days and this new one without any evidence just says any
[46:26.160 --> 46:35.360]  semites don't like Hollywood run by predominantly Jewish groups like Alex
[46:35.360 --> 46:44.040]  Jones when I am criticized by the Nazi camp who we know were federally funded
[46:44.040 --> 46:49.240]  and controlled for pointing out a Reuters article a few years ago that the
[46:49.240 --> 46:55.920]  majority of major movie houses now are owned by Arab investors certainly Jews
[46:55.920 --> 46:58.920]  run a lot of them and I said that in the piece it got clipped up and edited it
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.440]  out where it sounded like I was making the false statement that Arabs own
[47:02.440 --> 47:08.400]  Hollywood I said they own the majority stock just like much of the stock of
[47:08.400 --> 47:11.520]  news corps is owned by Arabs I was simply pointing out that the Saudi
[47:11.520 --> 47:18.120]  Arabians are deep in bed with this whole global system so I have Brett Bart
[47:18.120 --> 47:22.720]  attacking me with no evidence I can I could sue them and win because it's
[47:22.720 --> 47:29.200]  meant to do damage to me even though I'm a public figure to lie about me with
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.080]  malice of fourth thought with intent to hurt me so I've got this government run
[47:35.080 --> 47:41.680]  group neocon funded most their advertisers on their CIA army you name it go
[47:41.680 --> 47:45.400]  look at the banners and it's admitted the government's funding all these
[47:45.400 --> 47:49.560]  different groups I've got them attacking me saying I'm an anti-Semite and then on
[47:49.560 --> 47:55.560]  the other side I have the Nazis attacking me saying I work for Israel why
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.080]  are they all coming after me because I understand how the globalist operate I
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.280]  understand their tricks I understand their full game plan we are mobilizing
[48:04.280 --> 48:10.640]  white people black people Germans Jews Asian Christian Muslim you doesn't matter
[48:10.640 --> 48:15.600]  against the globalist agenda that's just a bunch of Kinley made-off types
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.000]  robbing us people like Al Gore they don't want a message of unity against the
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.280]  globalists they want us all in different camps people that hate Catholics
[48:24.280 --> 48:28.680]  people that hate Jews people that bash me who are in the space alien cults the
[48:28.680 --> 48:33.120]  New Age space alien UFO cults who attack me look I'm not attacking any of your
[48:33.120 --> 48:39.720]  groups I'm not singling any group out I am speaking out against the banks that
[48:39.720 --> 48:45.040]  are taking over our country and that's why I am the number one target of the
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.720]  government and the mainstream media and George Soros foundations and the White
[48:49.720 --> 48:55.000]  House enemies list all on record and the Nazis controlled by the feds and the
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.360]  ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center they all attack me why are they
[49:00.360 --> 49:10.160]  attacking Alex Jones because we're doing something right we've got a good
[49:10.160 --> 49:16.040]  message a true message a clean message a loving message an honorable innocent
[49:16.040 --> 49:21.600]  message because the establishment taps my phones and they've assessed me and
[49:21.600 --> 49:27.360]  they've got my psychological profile and they know I'm a good person and I'm for
[49:27.360 --> 49:32.160]  real and they know I don't cheat people and I don't lie about people and I don't
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.920]  do dirty tricks and I don't hurt people and that's why the New World Order is
[49:36.920 --> 49:43.440]  scared to death of me they are scared to death because I get up here and I teach
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.680]  people the power you have and I show people how true activism at events and
[49:48.680 --> 49:53.560]  for Al Gore and for world leaders when they go to book signings the power of
[49:53.560 --> 49:58.040]  taking over all their events and running them to ground peacefully hounding them
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.120]  and how we can take over our cities and counties now we can educate the police
[50:02.120 --> 50:06.000]  with oath keepers and how we can reach out and shatter the division of the
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.160]  left-right paradigm folks if people follow what I say and implement it and
[50:11.160 --> 50:17.320]  develop it and even improve on it it's over game over for the New World Order
[50:17.640 --> 50:23.320]  so remember what I'm doing here is of the paramount importance because we are
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.520]  under attack from every angle and every side because our growth curve is
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.520]  straight up and the establishment knows that I am now becoming a true threat to
[50:32.520 --> 50:36.000]  them and I'll tell you right now I've never been in greater dam danger of
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.480]  being set up of being killed of being destroyed of being lied about in the
[50:41.480 --> 50:45.120]  media they're already doing it they're sniffing around they're trying to figure
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.560]  out a way to bring me down and if I am brought down remember that's a victory as
[50:49.560 --> 50:54.000]  well I don't want that to happen but you know what I'm in a fight for the life
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.160]  of my family in this country and whatever comes I'm ready and I thank God
[50:58.160 --> 51:04.120]  for the blessing heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood
[51:04.120 --> 51:08.320]  pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you but the

[55:08.160 --> 55:12.840]  medicine this looks radical what do you guys believe in I'm like well yeah in
[55:12.840 --> 55:17.280]  America you're not allowed to you you're not allowed to talk bad about the
[55:17.280 --> 55:22.360]  president's land of the slaves yes and so but but you finally found a theater
[55:22.360 --> 55:26.720]  that would let you yeah well at the Alamo Draft House West Oak they're
[55:26.720 --> 55:30.040]  Patriots but everyone else that I must be a terrorist too for trying to show a
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.720]  non-fiction documentary about listen that's not American Americans aren't
[55:34.720 --> 55:38.440]  supposed to have political views or show a film I mean man you think this is a
[55:38.440 --> 55:42.520]  free country you think our veterans fought and died so you'd have freedom
[55:42.520 --> 55:47.280]  you you're some kind of conspiracy theorist Colin yes I must be because I
[55:47.280 --> 55:51.480]  care about the country and you too you're a bad terrorist but it's showing on a
[55:51.480 --> 55:56.320]  Wednesday November 18th in the Houston area Alamo West Oak hopefully people can
[55:56.320 --> 55:59.440]  make it out and if hopefully they're not afraid of people who call them terrorists
[55:59.440 --> 56:02.160]  because they're trying to get the truth out and they care about yeah I mean the
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.800]  film calls for no violence it shows Obama admitting world government it shows
[56:05.800 --> 56:10.800]  Al Gore calling for world government it shows congressional testimony and and
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.080]  former federal regulators we interviewed an economist and best-selling
[56:15.080 --> 56:19.760]  authors about the New World Order oh my gosh Americans you're not allowed to do
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.520]  that I mean with the free speech zone so so they would call that they would say
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.680]  I was a terrorist if they said we looked like we could be radical terrorists
[56:29.680 --> 56:33.760]  for trying to show this movie and they said oh well terrorist groups try to
[56:33.760 --> 56:37.280]  rent out movie theaters in Los Angeles and show terrorist movies we have to
[56:37.280 --> 56:40.760]  check in we think this looks like terrorism we can't do business with you
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.920]  and movie theaters are closing all across the country and they refuse my
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.280]  money's no good to them because I want to show a film about the Constitution in
[56:48.280 --> 56:53.040]  America you can't do that you and that's why the Republic is falling because the
[56:53.040 --> 56:57.080]  entire Bill of Rights has been shot to pieces like somebody blasted it a hundred
[56:57.080 --> 57:01.000]  times with a 12-gauge shotgun you ever seen a sign out in the country riddled
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.280]  with shotgun holes that's a Constitution and then how dare you try to make a try
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.520]  to show a film and how dare I make a film I mean again folks you must get
[57:13.520 --> 57:18.000]  fall the Republic on DVD you must make copies of it you've got to get it out
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.600]  to everyone show it at your local library show it everywhere and if you know
[57:22.600 --> 57:26.520]  if I was you I would write an article and post it on the web about the theaters
[57:26.520 --> 57:30.560]  and get quotes from these people saying it's terrorism because that will only
[57:30.560 --> 57:33.800]  cause thousands of other people to want to go find out what all the hubbub's
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.280]  about see we're the good people we're the real Americans we have our first
[57:38.280 --> 57:43.000]  amendment we have to exercise it or lose it Colin how many theaters said it
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.360]  might be terrorism or but they they own a monopoly on most of the movie theaters
[57:48.360 --> 57:54.800]  a terrorist film yeah radical and you know something to do with terrorism and
[57:54.800 --> 58:01.440]  Obama looks so menacing on the cover he looks menacing you can't have that I
[58:01.440 --> 58:07.080]  it's so scary I I mean did you explain to them I'm a national radio host and
[58:07.080 --> 58:12.920]  that my documentary films have been written up all over the world yes I did
[58:12.920 --> 58:15.280]  I you know but they they're not interested in that they're just
[58:15.280 --> 58:20.840]  they're scared of images and things they don't understand and hi well remember
[58:20.840 --> 58:26.480]  that it's now all over the news that the government is paying for messages to be
[58:26.480 --> 58:32.160]  implanted in children's TV shows movies adult television shows Al Gore is all
[58:32.160 --> 58:37.520]  over mainline sitcoms pushing the global warming tax that's okay to tell us the
[58:37.520 --> 58:50.160]  earth's dying we don't pay Al Gore money thank you for listening to GCN this is
[58:50.160 --> 58:53.520]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:53.520 --> 58:57.480]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:57.480 --> 59:01.720]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:01.720 --> 59:06.000]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.360]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.360 --> 59:14.440]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.440 --> 59:19.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.120 --> 59:27.080]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.080 --> 59:30.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:30.920 --> 59:33.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.600]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at WWW dot my
[59:38.600 --> 59:42.720]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government

[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:20.760]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:35.520]  a subject I want to cover at the bottom of the hour is television propaganda
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:40.200]  number one it's completely illegal the general accounting office found six
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:45.560]  years ago with Bush Obama has radically expanded it and now they just admit that
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:49.680]  there are pro-global warming tax messages anti-second amendment messages
[1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:56.400]  anti-family messages anti in the Fed messages just pure propaganda every
[1:00:56.400 --> 1:01:00.840]  drama every sitcom almost every major television show that's on broadcast TV
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:10.000]  is government propaganda now and I want to go over this because it's just
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  incredible let's talk to Ian in Florida Ian you're on the air go ahead
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.640]  thank you buddy hey buddy I called you last Monday just to get the ball rolling
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.240]  and later that night for the Al Gore protest here in Boca Raton I joined
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:30.360]  about 14 meetup groups and all in all we had about 250 people there I've got a
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:36.160]  great little mini report for you we basically boot for two hours solid at
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:41.320]  an outdoor venue and all of the major news reports that we got in whether it
[1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:47.080]  be TV radio online blog basically were probably edited by the editors of the
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:51.840]  people who wrote the story and they said that there was about a thousand people
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:57.200]  inside or two thousand people or eight hundred people there was maybe 250 people
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:01.920]  inside and just about the same amount out what you do is you videotape that
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:05.640]  which I'm sure you did or somebody did then you show the local newscast how
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:11.040]  they lied that's very use and then you you put it on YouTube and everywhere this
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:14.920]  happens you show everyone the lies and then the mainstream media further
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:20.640]  implodes but look super job you still got all over TV all over radio all over
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.640]  the newspapers and it was pointed out in the Boca Raton newspaper in fact I
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:29.960]  happen to have it right here in my stack I'm trying to dig it out right now it
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:35.680]  was admitted that there were at least 200 of you guys it's as gore's presentation
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:42.040]  on climate change draws 800 has 200 protesters gather outside and it points
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:45.120]  out that he is making money off of it then it says cap and trade don't be

[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:22.600]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:26.940]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:32.200]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:37.240]  three of the selected individuals who they were choosing to be the head of the
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.080]  European Union all three were Bilderberg group members and they did choose a
[1:08:41.080 --> 1:08:45.840]  Bilderberg group member on Friday we wrote stories about that on our news
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:52.840]  websites Chuck Norris is talking about the New World Order even Dick Morris
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:56.600]  constantly when I hear him on radio or TV is admitting we're going into world
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:01.560]  government and Sean Hannity turns red on his own TV show when the Fox pundit
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:05.080]  admits the truth I'm not saying Dick Morris is a good guy Ron Paul is talking
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:08.640]  about the New World Order more and more people are talking about it and so now
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:16.640]  the social blind spot that has been implanted in people's psyche is being
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:23.960]  removed it's now becoming socially kosher socially acceptable and you're not
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:27.080]  supposed to talk about politics or religion America was all about politics
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:30.640]  and religion until a hundred years ago and they said oh it's not polite shut up
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:35.040]  retreat into your houses don't get on the soapboxes anymore all the people are
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:39.720]  learning how to get on the soapboxes and the real fights are when 10 20 30 40
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:44.840]  people go out and confront politicians I told you years ago that would grow into
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:50.040]  hundreds and then thousands and then into hundreds of thousands uncontrollable
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:54.360]  information coming out even if they shut the web off they're not going to be able
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:58.720]  to shut the people off look at the power of you the listeners of this show
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:04.200]  posting the Obama Joker posters worldwide from Japan to England from Mexico to
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:10.920]  the United States from Canada to Thailand all over TV internationally all over
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:14.360]  radio all over newspapers and it got even bigger when the newspaper said
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:18.680]  arrest Mr. Jones arrest whoever's putting these up people said well wait a
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:22.760]  minute they're pulling down these signs but not garage sale signs and not pro
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:28.600]  Obama signs so it blew up in their face they said well wait you were allowed to
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:35.000]  do this with Bush why not with Obama so see we make them show their hand of
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.520]  tyranny we make them show us who they are now Ian called in a week ago and he
[1:10:40.520 --> 1:10:47.280]  said coming up this weekend Al Gore is gonna be in Boca Raton Florida and you
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:50.480]  can go to his websites Al Gore's websites and find out where he's going to be
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:59.280]  next and spontaneously through the meet-ups through we are change it's we
[1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:03.360]  are change that is first going out to all the events it's just a name it's a
[1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:09.840]  spontaneous activism what one 19 year old man did two and a half years ago
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:13.320]  Luke Radowski when he got kicked out of 9-11 truth because he was going after
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:16.880]  the globalists they wanted to control it in New York and I said Luke we're gonna
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:22.600]  support you don't drop out don't quit he said never I said take action start an
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:25.720]  organization keep confronting the politicians he wanted to have 9-11
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:29.280]  truth do that in New York and I'm not saying they were bad in New York they
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:33.160]  just wanted to stay on one mission and now it's spread everywhere and now
[1:11:33.160 --> 1:11:36.520]  there's second amendment groups now there's hundreds of other groups the
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:46.440]  Sons of Liberty is forming call it whatever you want it's the Sons and
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.240]  Daughters of Liberty it's the people of Liberty it's the children of Liberty
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:56.760]  it's rising and so all over Florida TV and on national television and in
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:04.160]  scores of newspapers they took over 250 is what Ian is saying I've seen photos
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:09.520]  and videos it looks like over 200 I remember the event said it only had
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:14.680]  300 tickets so how is the media reporting by the way it says they wouldn't
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:20.360]  let the media in the event how is the media reporting 2001 thousand and 800
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:26.160]  that's the different news articles I have two thousand eight hundred what which
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:31.080]  is it so they didn't want it to be in the news that more people were outside
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:36.440]  against him then we're inside foreign and everywhere he goes this is now
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:39.960]  catching fire like I told you six months ago with the tea parties and I said
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:42.400]  watch they're gonna try to co-opt him and they've tried but it's still not
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:47.200]  working and notice these politicians now can't go anywhere and they can't sell
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:49.920]  the public that oh you want cap and trade when everybody comes out and
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:55.000]  protest it it's pointless to have one big demonstration in Washington the media
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:00.040]  can ignore that but they can't send in their operatives to shut down coverage
[1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:03.880]  in every town in every city yet they don't have complete control your local
[1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:12.160]  reporters aren't all operatives that's only at the top national level they
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:18.360]  cannot stop you if you take action they cannot stop you I've learned with the
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.720]  State House and the city council and county commissioners when I choose to
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:26.560]  fight something myself locally we defeat them every time I just can't fight all
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:34.600]  of them you can you are the leaders you have the power we are a headless
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:40.400]  Leviathan because we have 10 million heads we cannot be stopped if you
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:45.880]  realize you can't be stopped nothing can stop you if you take action and in
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:50.920]  Florida give us a full report from Florida you called into the show we
[1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:54.680]  posted a video on the Alex Jones channel I appreciate all the kind emails
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.920]  I've gotten from the attendees that really helped it get supercharged so
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:02.040]  there wouldn't just be 30 or 40 next time Al Gore shows up I think he's in
[1:14:02.040 --> 1:14:06.360]  Arizona next didn't he we need to pull up find out where he's at and then have
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.920]  a thousand show up then it'll be ten thousand and then it's over for that
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:17.680]  slime bag he's that easy to defeat that liar would get up and say I'm not making
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:20.560]  any money off this just three years ago now he has to admit it he would say
[1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:24.600]  polar bears couldn't swim three years ago now he has to admit they can swim he
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:27.720]  was saying the ice caps had completely melted three years ago now he has to
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:31.600]  admit they get bigger in the winter smaller in the summer now he's having
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:35.880]  to admit 30 plus top 30,000 plus top scientists are saying it's all a fraud
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:40.480]  now they're talking about pulling it off the table like they did the different
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:48.440]  treaties for Europe the Lisbon and bringing it back because they know our
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:52.160]  critical mass is building against them they want to retire from the field or
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:55.520]  at least they're putting out that signal you got to watch them when they
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:15:00.960]  start running you intensify firepower you route the enemy you drive them into
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:05.000]  their bases in the info or you discredit them and smash them okay Ian go
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:09.480]  ahead from Florida give us a report oh great everything you're saying is so
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:13.080]  correct and I have to give you and Luke and so many other great patriots
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:18.560]  props for the inspiration to ignite the fuel under so many other people and you
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:23.000]  know we are the leaderless resistance you know exercising our freedoms and
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  basically we are led by the Constitution in the Bill of Rights but
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.640]  yes we are leaderless in that we don't have some central group running us that
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:35.480]  the globalist always have fake patriots out saying we've got to centralize we've
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:41.960]  got to go under someone's command no we're under the command of the Bill of
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:46.120]  Rights and Constitution and Declaration of Independence go ahead I'm sorry no
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:50.680]  that's great and basically I initiated so much chatter on Monday night on the
[1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:55.320]  internet that by Friday some online newspapers started writing articles
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:59.560]  about an upcoming protest so I got an email and a phone call Friday morning
[1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:04.000]  from the captain of the Boca Raton police captain mendic and he basically just
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.560]  wanted to know exactly what we had planned because I did say stuff online
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:11.840]  about confronting Gore with a video camera so I explained to him everything
[1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:16.840]  that we do why we do it how it inspires people on the next stop that these
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:20.720]  criminals make and he basically just wanted to inform us where we could
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:25.080]  stand and where we couldn't we had a pretty huge quote-unquote free speech
[1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:29.480]  zone and again let me stop you for I forget five years ago they would have
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.200]  just said no protest allowed but they've lost so many suits because of people
[1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:36.600]  fighting back the police are now behaving themselves a little bit better
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:41.240]  and not disgracing their uniforms so that's good good that the police didn't
[1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:46.080]  try to try to set fire to the flag go ahead we live in a bit of a bubble here
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:50.480]  and it was one of those you know nice developments as all the classy trendy
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:54.040]  restaurants with a big amphitheater at the end so they gave us the whole park
[1:16:54.040 --> 1:16:59.240]  in the middle the whole median and they did line the streets good 20 30 cops
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:03.240]  right in front of us a bunch of private security all around the ground and we
[1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:08.200]  booed so loud that we know every attendee in there had to listen it very very
[1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:13.040]  closely just to hear out the newspaper was inside they they said the TV was
[1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:17.960]  forced to turn their cameras off the newspaper does report that you were
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:25.000]  drowning out even that swollen blood tick Al Gore's disgusting voice and one
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:28.040]  quick thing I want to point out here because this is the psychology that
[1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:32.400]  they do in this Orwellian double-speak reality that we've come into living in
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:36.480]  here basically I was really tuning my ears to hear what he was going to say
[1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:41.320]  about us and it came toward the end after he made his point he basically said
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:46.920]  he started to ramble on he goes so not only is this a moral issue or an
[1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:51.960]  ethical obligation of our times it is a spiritual and hold on Alex let me
[1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:57.080]  explain it is a spiritual issue and that's why those people outside are
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:00.960]  doing what they're doing and I got it later that night he was saying we're
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:06.000]  the non-believers attack them yes he's saying you're a heretic you're a devil
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:09.480]  you've got to be burned at the stake and again Al Gore didn't invent this
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:14.800]  religious angle look at the Newsweek headline an eco-profit gets real the UN
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:18.720]  states in the 1996 biological diversity assessment that they're going to
[1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:25.920]  establish a world guy worship religion yep yep and now that's coming out in
[1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:30.080]  his new movie he's gonna be coming out with that and obviously you know with
[1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:33.440]  no science that's the only way they can go is get everybody like you say that's
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:37.560]  so much into the anti-establishment religions like the New Age type of
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:44.320]  movement and just convert all of them over into this save the planet non you
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:48.160]  know scientific argument where it's basically ideology covering up
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:52.720]  climatology and we you and I Alex and all of us out there we're the true
[1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.560]  environmentalists we understand who's really polluting the environment to
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:19:00.640]  create this illusion that we need to change it's the very people funding this
[1:19:00.640 --> 1:19:05.160]  change yes it's a smokescreen to block out genetic engineering toxic waste
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:09.360]  dumping all the rest of it and make it all about taxing carbon on the cover of
[1:19:09.360 --> 1:19:13.440]  Newsweek it shows a green apple above his head the thinking man's thinking man
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:18.520]  Al Gore's new plan for the planet that apple was grown and developed by its
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:24.480]  parent tree from carbon dioxide see it's all a sick joke in our face now how are
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:28.640]  you hearing his speech was it on speakers yeah this is one of the only
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:32.800]  venues I mean he must have he's a real expert because he kept going and going
[1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:36.760]  and and I mean I doubt he could hear his own words it was an outdoor amphitheater
[1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:42.160]  so our voices literally echoed off the amphitheater you have the audio of him
[1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:46.520]  saying it's a new religion I hope we do we're pulling everybody's audio we're
[1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:49.000]  trying to edit everything up and we're gonna get it off to you throughout the

[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:51.720]  the end of Fed rally so I'm really excited about that one other thing I
[1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:57.000]  wanted to share with you very quickly was this past Sunday yesterday just
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:03.680]  before 10 o'clock in the morning I had the TV on and clicking the channels and
[1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:10.560]  on CNN just before 10 Eastern Standard Time there was a clip where they were
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:16.120]  talking about skull and bones and the Bush family and involved with the
[1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:22.320]  Geronimo skull and the secret society yeah the great-great grandson of
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:29.720]  Geronimo sued Prescott Bush when he was a college student Swinton did a grave
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:34.520]  robbery as a skull and bones initiation they robbed graves you can't make the
[1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:39.240]  stuff up folks this is like ABC news and they admittedly have his skull and the
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:43.880]  federal court said the elite can keep your skull so the bushes are allowed to
[1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:51.440]  steal body parts thickening isn't it look I mean how about they dig up your
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:57.320]  great-grand Eddie I mean it's just they do whatever they want what was shocking
[1:25:57.320 --> 1:26:02.360]  was the fact that it was on CNN which I call controlled news network but see
[1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:06.640]  that's part of throwing it in your face look we'll grave rob you if we want we
[1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:14.040]  own you so CNN reported that huh yes it was listen ten years ago I would get on
[1:26:14.040 --> 1:26:18.040]  talk radio and talk about skull and bones and have national radio say I was
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:26.000]  insane and it didn't exist well just wanted to say that keep up the good
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.240]  work passing out DVDs at the end of Fed Raleigh and telling everybody I can
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:37.400]  about fall of the Republic awesome documentary it just really makes people
[1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:42.240]  understand that the Federal Reserve is the enemy and they're the ones causing
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:46.600]  all the problems in the economy in the first place so it's just I just have to
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:51.160]  tell everybody out there to watch it it is just mind-blowing it's very
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:55.960]  simplistic you don't have to have a PhD but it's evil we can't show it movie
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:01.960]  theaters because it's terrorist oh Delilah good to hear from you let's talk
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:07.520]  to Steven in Texas you're on the air Steve yeah good afternoon fellow terrorist

[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:23.800]  that's the way you guys should be referred to and you know me and sarcastic
[1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:26.720]  because I'm totally there is now what the government running everything we're
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:31.120]  able right I had three quick points I wanted to make first about it a lady
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:34.520]  calling your show yesterday talking about a friend or relatives or of hers
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:39.280]  or something about childbirth and see sections and all that and as a father of
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:43.120]  seven kids they just want to put advice out there to people in this area of
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:49.560]  childbirth avoid hospitals hospitals are for sick people not and pregnant women
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:54.640]  aren't sick hire a good midwife and have a home birth hospitals doctors will tell
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:59.160]  you are just full of bad bugs viruses bacteria and they're full of the worst
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:04.000]  drug-resistant stuff that can't make it out of the hospital but that lives in
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.160]  the hospital lives in the vents lives in the rooms and I don't know how many
[1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:11.920]  people I've known so many people who were healthy who go in for a hernia
[1:28:11.920 --> 1:28:17.800]  operation or go in for a nail through their foot or go in for a nasal surgery
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:20.360]  who just don't come out from the infection that kills them good to hear
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:25.760]  from you Steve Jason in Canada you're on the air good day sir it's an honor
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:31.960]  hey buddy reason for my call basically I see a lot of this stuff from up here so
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:35.920]  I have this vantage point of what's gonna happen in Canada after seeing everything
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:41.520]  that's happening in the United States I hear things on our news like our
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:45.800]  Prime Minister Stephen Harper says things like after the economic downfall Canada
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:50.240]  is going to be stronger and have a greater foot presence in the world now
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:56.080]  after watching follow the Republic there was a point between brands where you
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:01.280]  have Coke Pepsi Burger King and McDonald's I was it got me to thinking if
[1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:06.520]  is it possible that Canada might be used as a second brand because I mean we
[1:29:06.520 --> 1:29:09.840]  haven't had terrorist events up here although they've tried to perpetuate
[1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:13.680]  them with in the news Canada's run by the exact same system everything that
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:17.920]  happens to you is going to happen to us in vice versa so same management group
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:23.320]  running it all oh and I totally believe that I guess China is gonna be the new
[1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:28.440]  model as Obama has said talking down America
[1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:34.080]  anything else from Canada there Jason you believe anything's gonna happen at
[1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:37.440]  the Olympics I mean like I said nothing's happened up here and no they've
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:42.400]  announced martial law for the Olympics it's just any excuse to train you the
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:45.360]  troops are gonna be on the street I don't know if the globalists are gonna
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:50.040]  stage an event I will be right back with more calls

[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:54.320]  today show and we look forward to having him on with us next hour I thought I'd
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:58.040]  play this clip now just to give you a little little taste of what we're gonna
[1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:05.840]  be getting into this is Damon Vickers last week on CNBC and more pundits are
[1:34:05.840 --> 1:34:09.520]  coming out and saying what he and others are saying so it's becoming mainstream
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:13.840]  that we're going into a global government here it is we're back with
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:17.600]  Damon Vickers chief investment officer nine points capital partners staying with
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:22.480]  us live out of Seattle Washington then you guys are a hedge fund in which you
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:26.920]  guys basically do is you try and catch breaks into the up or downside
[1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:30.800]  apparently with oil also with gold you've done the timing for you I got in
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:36.640]  just as it started to oil up a past 75 gold past a thousand are you gonna sit
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:43.880]  on those positions next yeah for sure yeah there's this is this is you know
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:47.920]  this is I mean you can think a lot about it and you can you know you know you
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:52.920]  know one day and and you know have all these vacillations psychologically but
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:58.520]  you know this is the time to you know to play ping-pong to you know pick up on
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:04.680]  you know get involved in model making or or or something ridiculous I mean this
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.600]  is the time where you make money where the trend develops and so there's really
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:13.240]  not a lot to do with it I mean oil looks higher gold looks higher currencies
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:16.800]  look weaker all for the reasons that we talked about before I mean you've got
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:22.440]  huge wage disparities I don't know how that inevitably resolves itself it may
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:27.560]  resolve itself in some type of a of a global currency crisis and then if the
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:32.720]  global currency crisis unfolds then inevitably you get I guess an alignment
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:40.680]  under a global world government a new global currency and a new world order
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:46.240]  so we may be moving towards that talks a little bit more about this currency
[1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:49.840]  crisis you see erupting what does that assume about what's gonna happen to the
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:56.640]  dollar well it assumes that the dollar will utterly get destroyed and become
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:01.240]  virtually worthless you know we have a combined well I mean here's what we know
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:06.440]  we know that that that if you can produce something that this this this game
[1:36:06.440 --> 1:36:10.200]  that we have going on in the United States and on a planetary basis cannot
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:15.800]  perpetuate itself forever we've got a 65 trillion dollar negative net worth we
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:20.360]  cannot possibly meet with our health care costs and our our you know our
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:24.680]  indulgent society which which we'd have in the United States we can't put that
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:28.880]  against the labor the unit labor cost of a China that can produce something at a
[1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:34.440]  dollar an hour versus $24 an hour with health benefits and you know all the
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:37.960]  all that that's built into there so how does that inevitably resolve itself
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:42.480]  when we say the U.S. sir you say the U.S. needs a softer weaker more
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:47.080]  competitive dollar partly because of this old wage disparity but then again
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:50.720]  overnight we had the productivity numbers out nine and a half percent and
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:56.480]  that makes up for a lot of those kind of rates probably not sustainable yeah it's
[1:36:56.480 --> 1:37:03.640]  not okay he's where this next hour the job on the producers getting him on by
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:11.520]  the way let's talk turkey let's talk about what's really going on here more
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:18.440]  than anything the green revolution is about distracting the population's
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:22.120]  legitimate concern for real environmental problems like overfishing
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:28.000]  cross-species genetic engineering toxic waste dumping to distract public
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:32.800]  attention away from real problems the globalist are causing predominantly off
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:39.160]  and to allowing them to tax carbon dioxide and other life-giving gases that
[1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:42.720]  are part of our atmosphere every major study shows we're actually at a very
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:47.920]  low point for carbon dioxide in the last 200,000 years plants grow faster live
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:52.560]  longer or healthier put off more oxygen we're at a low oxygen point one of the
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:56.200]  lowest levels ever recorded they go back to ice samples 200 plus thousand years
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:38:02.000]  old oxygen has been as much as twice as prevalent the atmosphere carbon dioxide
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:08.160]  14 times higher humans live longer or healthier they've done long-term test on
[1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:14.080]  rodents in higher oxygen controlled environments where they live their lives
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:20.240]  out in higher oxygen they live longer have less disease the earth is low on
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:24.560]  oxygen we need more
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:35.440]  we're on a planetoid flying through space think of the atmosphere as the skin
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:41.960]  on a apple it's thinner than the skin of an apple per capita in a side-by-side
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:48.840]  comparison the atmosphere is thinner than the skin of an apple we are these
[1:38:48.840 --> 1:38:52.160]  little creatures that live in these little valleys on the surface of the
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:56.240]  planet where there's oxygen when we go up in the mountains we have trouble
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:01.400]  breathing you go up 12,000 feet most people start getting arable having
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:06.240]  nightmares having getting getting exhausted you go up to 15 16 17,000
[1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:12.520]  feet most people get altitude sickness and will die we live in this very thin
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:18.120]  little biosphere and plants breathe carbon dioxide and we breathe oxygen
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:22.280]  look you're saying what does it have to do with world government the globalist
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  control the world's fiat currencies they use the Imperial US and British
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:31.720]  military to enforce that nations accept the private takeover of the central
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:36.720]  banks of their nations if you don't you get overthrown they took over here in
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:44.560]  1913 they are in the final phase now of using up the dollar as the world reserve
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:49.080]  currency for the last 50 plus years of the dollar being the world currency the
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:53.760]  globalist have used it to buy up shipping ports roads mines governments
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:58.240]  media the private group of families that own the issuance of currency and credit
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:03.360]  they own it all they own all the big assets now they want your house your
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:07.040]  farm your ranch your very livelihood so they admit through globalism they've
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:10.360]  deindustrialized the West they've moved it to China that they've made a deal
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:17.440]  with David Rockefeller 1973 sent George W. Bush CIA director over there to be
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:21.800]  ambassador to China they formed this agreement this deal now the president
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:25.600]  Obama's bad-mouthing the US saying we're not good for industry and business
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:29.160]  China's the place to move I played that clip earlier in fact cue that back up
[1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:35.320]  again the Obama clip thank you he's been given the speech for at least a year
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:38.600]  and a half this clips from the campaign trail that's coming up I heard him say
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:46.720]  it again yesterday in China they've moved all their assets offshore now they
[1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:50.080]  want to implode the economy to get what's left that's why they've staged
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:55.400]  terror attacks as the smokescreen to put militarized police and military on the
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:40:58.560]  streets and start the spying on the citizens in the tracking and tracing
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:03.320]  electronically now they're bringing in a world ID card it'll be a national ID
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:07.400]  card in subdivisions that everything you buy sell and do in the name of carbon
[1:41:07.400 --> 1:41:12.200]  credits and national sales tax will be registered on you won't be able to use
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:16.400]  cash unless you swipe the card it will be accessed with a thumbprint a digital
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:21.800]  face scan this is already you in treaty nine years ago now you see it all being
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:25.560]  announced oh California you're gonna have a card to buy and sell with your
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:30.680]  carbon credits Oregon New York oh England oh the Netherlands Germany
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:35.960]  France Japan it's global government they're gonna bypass cashless society
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:39.760]  completely there's not gonna be any new global currency you're gonna have
[1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:44.160]  regional currencies run by them that still have a local look but it's all
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:49.560]  standardized and set by the New World Order this is all stated and you can go
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:53.600]  to any ATM or machine it'll kick out the local creds for your district because
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:56.680]  they want to track where that money's going and your name is going to be
[1:41:56.680 --> 1:42:04.800]  attached in the history of that money off its digital stripe and they can fully
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:09.000]  control the economy shut down the the black market because the globalists
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.440]  want to bankrupt you and drive you on to welfare and government
[1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:15.960]  institutionalization they want you dependent but they know that bringing in
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:19.560]  this system is going to create a giant black market you engage in paying your
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:27.240]  neighbor in barter you're going to jail you have a bizarre or you have a flea
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:31.960]  market or you have a sale a garage sale you're going to jail you try to sell
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:38.520]  plants Christmas trees on the side of the road firewood already in the European
[1:42:38.520 --> 1:42:44.680]  Union you go to jail in many areas in Germany to cut a tree on your property
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:48.760]  you've got to get a special license for each tree and get it approved that's
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:52.480]  going worldwide you want to be a feudal surf you understand what you're gonna
[1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:56.000]  live like go get encyclopedia Britannica you I'm sure you got old ones in the
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:03.120]  garage erratic get the F's and look up feudalism get the S pull out the S
[1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:08.240]  book and read surfdom that's exactly what we're all living under you got me
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:14.800]  you're going to be a sharecropping slave a sharecroppers worse than a regular
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:18.380]  slave if you read US history it was worse a lot of times be a poor white
[1:43:18.380 --> 1:43:21.800]  sharecropper need to be a black slave because the slave owners at least by
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:24.880]  law supposedly had to feed their slaves not a sharecropper you could starve to
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:29.000]  death quite a few families kids starve to death the ribs sticking out of their
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:33.080]  sides because they had to live and and pay everything to the company store I
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:38.160]  owe my soul to the company store and when they ended the horrible practice of
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:42.880]  black slavery in the US they just made them sharecroppers and they were many
[1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:50.280]  blacks pointed out they were worse off out of the frying pan into the oven so
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:56.120]  the new global currency is going to be in carbon credits carbon just like we
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:59.320]  got the Federal Reserve Act you have to have the taxing mechanism for a new
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:04.560]  system so the Federal Reserve took over 1913 that same year we got the 16th
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:08.560]  Amendment for the private IRS to collect money for the private Federal Reserve you
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:15.000]  notice you write your checks the Federal Reserve when you pay your income tax did
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:20.760]  you notice that well now they're recreating the open-world government
[1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:24.760]  and it's going to tax oil at the wellhead all beef all mutton all sheep all
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:31.080]  fish all pork are all poultry all rubber all plastic all roads all cars all
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:36.840]  children all television sets everything will have a carbon credit it's
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:42.800]  already going in menus in Europe and Japan and the locals get a cut the
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:46.280]  county gets a cut the state gets a cut the feds get a cut but under
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.880]  international law the UN gets the biggest cut along with the private banks that
[1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:58.440]  launder the money this is the new currency and to bring this new system in
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:02.360]  they got a first bankrupt this country in the dollar and so the big banks have
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:06.640]  taken the hundreds of trillions 23.7 trillion is the last year in the U.S.
[1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:09.440]  alone and they've bought up real assets see when they get the money it still has
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:12.640]  the value and then they devalue it and send it out to you and you're paid and
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:15.280]  devalued money
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:26.640]  now I'm hearing yuppie radio and mainline TV everywhere say gold gold is
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:30.560]  the way to go everybody get into gold I've been warning you for years that as
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:33.360]  soon as it went above a thousand the yuppies were gonna figure out it was
[1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:37.360]  the investment and then that was going to cause a shortage and now it's all
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:44.040]  over the news barrack shuts hedge book as world gold supply runs out I have
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:50.640]  another article from MSNBC there's another story up on kitco in fact I
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:53.600]  thought I printed it guys and I don't see it go to kitco.com and like the
[1:45:53.600 --> 1:45:59.560]  third story down says gold supplies in South Africa overestimated by ninety
[1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:04.840]  percent suddenly South Africa got its bluff called in the hedge funds and they
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:09.840]  go oh sorry we didn't have that gold we said we had it is now red level insanity
[1:46:09.840 --> 1:46:15.000]  right as the rush starts what the anti-gold trust group of gold mines
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.680]  suing the private fellow reserve and the IMF for artificially suppressing the
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:23.000]  price of gold saying there wasn't that much gold it should be a lot more now
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:26.720]  it's all happening and if I want to bring up for the next few minutes Ted
[1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:32.480]  Anderson to talk about this Ted dollar fall sending gold a record high one
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:36.040]  hundred one thousand one hundred and thirty three dollars and twenty cents
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:41.720]  today I mean this is getting insane Ted Anderson well I know and I know you
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:45.200]  printed that off Alex but it's gone up all the way up past one thousand one
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:49.080]  hundred and forty one since you printed it so my gosh it's much higher than that
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:54.000]  I mean all day all this morning I've been working on trying to put together a
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:58.240]  national campaign for your video follow the Republic I think it's that important
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.640]  for people to have and I've got my brokers knocking on my door saying hey
[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:05.560]  what are we gonna do for a special today we got people that want to buy this
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:09.240]  stuff and I'm like scratching my head finally had to throw up my arms I said
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:13.680]  just give them Friday's prices and I'm gonna lose money that's exactly what's
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:19.720]  going on right now the supplies of gold and silver and local gold pawn shops and
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:24.480]  and jewelry stores and you name it it's all bought up there's very little left
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:30.560]  out there at all the supply of coins is shrinking up and here we have you know
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:35.600]  what I would consider the beginnings of a feeding frenzy like you said coming
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:40.280]  from the yuppie population which is you know obviously gonna drive premiums up
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:44.480]  and gold and silver coins you know I just feel fortunate enough to be able to
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:48.840]  have opportunities every now and then to buy when the price ticks back it's been
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:52.960]  so hard for me to hold prices down Alex I know my prices are gonna go up
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:56.280]  tomorrow they should be going up today I should have raised them today I didn't
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:48:01.400]  have time but I will offer the same deal I did Friday because I already have to
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:05.240]  the customers I called that listen to your show all weekend long I have Frank's
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:11.680]  currently right now at 246 of British sovereigns at 299 that is exactly the
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:16.920]  same price I had him on Friday even though gold has gone up from the
[1:48:16.920 --> 1:48:24.840]  $1,118 mark now to $1,141 I also have some supplies and I got to say it's short we
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:30.640]  have Eagles Maple Leafs we have some of the what other we just had a whole long
[1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:35.280]  breath of different things sitting back there in the safe and I need and you know I just
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:38.400]  suggest that you call in if you're looking for gold and silver at this
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:43.120]  time we have old $20 gold pieces tens that kind of stuff many of those things
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:48.160]  are still priced even below that $1,000 level just because they've been
[1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:51.000]  sitting around an inventory we haven't had a chance to catch up let's be clear
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:55.240]  almost everybody else is sold out or running low giant premiums you are now
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:59.040]  running out of gold you bought in the market before it was a thousand dollars
[1:48:59.040 --> 1:49:08.560]  an ounce it's now at 1,140 you Ted you have never never never in buying low
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:13.640]  selling when it's high at the lower price changing the rules of gold and
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.360]  silver investment you have never offered anything a hundred dollars under what
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:23.240]  the market was you're saying you're offering gold and that you priced into
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:30.560]  the market 140 plus dollars below what it is now I mean that is absolutely the
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:36.400]  the best deal by at least 40 plus dollars you have ever offered here people
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:42.600]  are out of their minds nuts you were nuts when it was 260 and I said buy it

[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:17.800]  we're going live at the second segment of the next hour simulcasting the live
[1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:22.480]  radio show at prisonplanet.tv
[1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:30.760]  here's a report I got this from Kitco NMS NBC South African Gold on final death
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:36.640]  watch as top-grade scientist finds residual gold is more than 90% less than
[1:54:36.640 --> 1:54:42.160]  claimed research shows that production rate should fall permanently below 100
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:47.920]  tons a year within the coming decade that dovetails with global gold supplies
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:52.040]  reported on in that headline of the London Telegraph Barrick Shutt's hedge
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:56.720]  book on world's gold supply as it runs out global gold production is in
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:01.360]  terminal decline despite record prices and Herculean efforts by mining
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:05.040]  companies to discover fresh sources of ore in remote spots according to the
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:10.000]  world's top producer Barrick Gold of Canada and you look at the dollar
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.680]  plunging other commodities going up it's because the dollar is plunging but
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:18.040]  not just the dollar with gold it's because supplies are at all time lows
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:23.160]  we're seeing one of the biggest if not biggest gold rushes in world history
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:31.920]  right now and it's very very very minuscule chance that in the next few
[1:55:31.920 --> 1:55:37.960]  years we're gonna see gold drop for any long period of time all the experts are
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:43.720]  saying only up up up up up up up up up up up up up and it looks like the
[1:55:43.720 --> 1:55:47.360]  globalist as Ted said two weeks ago I've decided to stop trying to suppress it
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:52.120]  and it is just shooting up and signifying that they're doing that
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:56.640]  they're their mainstream media organs after decades of saying don't buy gold
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:00.760]  all the elites were grabbing all the gold they could get at low prices they're
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:05.960]  now saying oh my gosh buy gold so it appears on every level that it's
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:10.320]  only going to be going up and even though gold sounds like a lot to be able
[1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:12.960]  to get it in a market at a thousand dollars an ounce that's a hundred and
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:17.600]  forty less than the market is right now it's gonna be a good deal in a month in
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:20.920]  fact my whole crew was in there going man I heard Alex five six years ago when
[1:56:20.920 --> 1:56:25.640]  was 300 saying getting it I wish we'd listen to him ladies and gentlemen I
[1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:31.080]  know basic economics and Ron Paul has a doctorate in it and I go off what he
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:35.440]  says and all the other experts we talked to I mean look I only pitch what I
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:39.320]  believe in I believe in the Second Amendment I don't sell guns but I say
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:43.480]  you should get them I believe in gold and the parent company has great prices
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:47.760]  minus resources so I promote it Ted supports me Ted's gonna run ads
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.040]  nationwide for fall the Republic I can't afford to do that he's getting
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:55.280]  ready to do it people think they have caught us in something no when we run
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:58.840]  national ads we we know everyone hears them that's that's the point the whole
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.080]  point is we are going after limbaugh's audience we are going after Hannity's
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:06.040]  audience we are trying to recruit people who've been in the dark that's the
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:10.800]  whole point is winning the ball game against the New World Order we have the
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:15.200]  initiative we're highly motivated we've studied history we know that fortune
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:21.800]  belongs to the bold we are defenders of the Republic and Ted is smart when
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:25.360]  everybody else isn't buying when it's low he buys and then sells at the low
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:29.760]  price when it's high that's how Ted Anderson is really becoming a huge
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:36.440]  market force in all of this 800 686 2237 Ted we got a minute left here and I've
[1:57:36.440 --> 1:57:41.720]  been ranting but bottom line what do all these indicators say to you 30 years in
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.840]  the business with them saying gold is running out combined with a giant bull
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:49.600]  market well I can just tell you this right now people are going to be looking
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:54.560]  back at $1100 gold is a really great buy and that changes there's a support
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:59.960]  level that's being formed probably somewhere around 1135 is where that
[1:57:59.960 --> 1:58:03.320]  where you'll see it bounce back if it does but I don't think we're going to
[1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:07.360]  even get that because it just keeps blowing through new highs right now
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:11.640]  what you're talking about with Barry Gold they're getting only three grams of gold
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:16.080]  per ton which they used to get 12 they can't afford to run at those at that
[1:58:16.080 --> 1:58:19.760]  production level anymore there's just not enough gold to go wrong even coming
[1:58:19.760 --> 1:58:23.800]  out of the mines Ted we got this big guess coming up but for the next five
[1:58:23.800 --> 1:58:28.440]  minutes on that short little segment explain that they don't just grab
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:33.240]  nuggets of gold out of mountains anymore they have to smash up tons and tons of
[1:58:33.240 --> 1:58:38.560]  ore just to get a few grams and that's even running out this is a perfect
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:41.040]  storm

[1:59:49.040 --> 2:00:00.040]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:19.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:30.560]  Alex Jones a decade ago back in 1999 I began interviewing a consortium of gold
[2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:35.440]  mines mainly smaller ones that knew that it was costing more money for them to
[2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:39.840]  mine gold than for what it was selling on the market and they watched the IMF
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:43.880]  the World Bank the International Arms of the Fellow Reserve artificially
[2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:48.600]  suppressing and they sued in court it's now come out that indeed they have been
[2:00:48.600 --> 2:00:53.400]  fixing prices Ted Anderson explained to people the mining process and why
[2:00:53.400 --> 2:00:56.920]  everything is now changing because it's not just that the dollar is being
[2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:01.840]  devalued and people are fleeing to safe havens it's also just that they are
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:08.240]  running out of recoverable discovered fields of gold they are the big rich
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:14.800]  veins of gold have been consumed mostly in the 1800s but they did mine an
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:20.000]  awful lot of gold up into the 1900s but the tailings that they would put aside
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:25.040]  because of the processes at that point they would only recover about about 60
[2:01:25.040 --> 2:01:29.720]  to 70% of the gold from the ore at that time they came out with that heap
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:35.480]  leaching method in the early 1900s and that was by pulverizing the ore
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:41.320]  putting it onto a rubberized pad and then sprinkling cyanide on top of it
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:45.520]  which would then leach the rest of the gold out of that or at least the
[2:01:45.520 --> 2:01:49.880]  Republic recoverable mineral and then they could turn that back into gold
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:54.160]  bars well they used to be able to when Barrick first started they were able to
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:59.120]  get 12 grams of gold per ton of ore so you got to figure this a ton of ore
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:02.480]  sitting at a truckload and they're driving it down to this leaching pan
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:06.920]  and dumping it onto this you know this this pool and sprinkling with cyanide
[2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:11.720]  well now they only get three grams of gold per ton of ore so you can kind of
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:16.720]  see where the process is going because it costs a lot of money to pulverize and
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:22.320]  dig this dirt from the ground and then and then move it to this orb field so
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:25.840]  they could have the cyanide sprinkled on and if you don't get enough gold out
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:30.360]  of the ore then you're gonna have to stop that operation or at least the price
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:34.880]  of gold has to rise enough so the little bit that you get is is you know enough to
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:39.720]  pay for your profit margin that you need to cover and so the the truth of the
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:43.600]  matter is is that the gold mines don't have as much gold in their ore as they
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:47.760]  used to they found the rich veins they've consumed those rich veins and now
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:53.200]  they're gone so unless if there's some miracle of some type that happens in the
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:57.400]  future where we're able to discover a whole new ore field somewhere I don't
[2:02:57.400 --> 2:03:01.440]  think that it's out there and that means a shortage of gold at the same time
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:06.440]  where you have a depreciation in the value of the dollar and it's losing the
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:11.680]  economic global mighty power of the US dollar you know it's no longer going to
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:16.360]  be the reserve currency obviously there's a demand for people to move into
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:20.000]  gold and it's not only just coming from people in the United States it's coming
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:24.640]  out of India China the Middle East I mean you can name it Europe just about
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:29.040]  any country out there wants to get out of the dollar and move to gold it's not
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:33.080]  confusing that gold's all the evidence shows only going to go up but the
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:38.080]  question is how high some analysts main line say 8,000 7,000 most of them say
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:42.080]  two and a half thousand what from 30 years in this business what do you think
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:46.020]  well you know I mean it wouldn't surprise me a bit if we had 1200 to
[2:03:46.020 --> 2:03:50.760]  $1,300 gold before the calendar turns to January you said that last week that
[2:03:50.760 --> 2:03:54.200]  might happen today I mean I know I know that's how quickly it'll happen and I'm
[2:03:54.200 --> 2:03:57.440]  still staying conservative on this I would think that we should be able to
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:03.160]  see $2,000 plus gold before the calendar turn next year now mind you we have a
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:07.440]  world crisis somewhere in the midst of that time that's where your five six
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:11.560]  seven eight thousand dollars an ounce comes from all I can say is what would
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:15.680]  you prefer to have this paper currency that's a fiat nature sitting in your
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:19.720]  portfolio or your pocket that represents the money that you've worked and so
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:23.400]  hard for over these years or would you prefer to have something that is actually
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:29.040]  honest and taste labor to produce and that's gold I just you know I I can't
[2:04:29.040 --> 2:04:32.720]  say it enough people always confuse it they think they should be sitting in
[2:04:32.720 --> 2:04:37.600]  this paper currency and gold is this off you know shoot of something it is all the
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:43.840]  elites are running away from paper right now into gold 1-800-686-2237 to take
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:47.120]  advantage of the best deal Ted Anderson and minus resources have ever offered
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:53.040]  800-686-2237 you're paying for prices that Ted got in the market when it was a

[2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:11.880]  political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Well I've seen him on CNBC
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:17.880]  CNN you name it he's Damon Vickers chief investment officer with nine points
[2:08:17.880 --> 2:08:24.480]  management and research their fund is up over 63% this year you don't see that
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:31.160]  with a lot of funds out there do you he has a long illustrious career and he has
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:35.560]  a 25-year track record of articulating investment themes with striking clarity
[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:40.280]  and then holding his ground as the daily barrage of market noise forces others
[2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:44.640]  to falter and I watch mainstream financial shows very few of them are
[2:08:44.640 --> 2:08:50.480]  accurate because most of them have an establishment spin but this guy has been
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:53.480]  very very accurate in the past that's why we've got him on and I was flattered
[2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:56.840]  to find out when we called him on the show that he is actually a listener
[2:08:56.840 --> 2:09:00.960]  sometimes so mr. Vickers it's great to have you on with us it's great to be
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:06.760]  with you not sometimes I listen I listen to your show Alex every night and I do
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:11.880]  appreciate the praise of saying that we're up 63% this year we're actually
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:15.960]  having a really good year this year I believe and we're long golden oil but
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:23.040]  we were actually up 63% last year in 2008 maybe that's even better but we we
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:28.600]  had a we had a really great year in 2008 so if I got that wrong how are you
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:32.400]  doing this year then we're doing okay I mean we've had some ups and downs we're
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:36.680]  long we're doing really good today I don't know if anybody's noticed but oil
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:40.920]  is up close to three dollars a barrel which is a reflection of the dollar
[2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:44.800]  situation which I know we'll be talking about and and gold gold is making new
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:49.400]  highs and we're a long goal so we're really happy with what we're seeing this
[2:09:49.400 --> 2:09:54.440]  year and I think we'll continue to do good for the balance of the year we like
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:59.840]  our positions very much I want to go through a whole host of issues with you
[2:09:59.840 --> 2:10:03.120]  today sir in the 50 minutes we have and your gracious to give us that much time
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:06.440]  in your busy schedule but but first tell the listeners who may not know who you
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:09.960]  are a little bit about yourself you have a long bio what's most important then
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:15.160]  let's recap and expand what you talked about last week on CNBC about global
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:20.640]  government world government into the dollar gold only going up and and what
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:25.280]  you see happening in the near term mid term and long term break it down for us
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:29.200]  yeah we'll have a chance to do all that I mean I've been I've been running money
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:36.480]  for about 25 years my father was a floor trader for Goldman Sachs under New York
[2:10:36.480 --> 2:10:40.960]  Stock Exchange my grandfather worked for Peter Peabody and best friends with
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:47.980]  Bill Donaldson who ran the the SEC and is currently on I believe Barack Obama's
[2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:53.120]  think tank at this point my great-grandmother Catherine Angel founded
[2:10:53.120 --> 2:10:58.120]  the Culinary Institute of America also also known as the CIA ironically enough
[2:10:58.120 --> 2:11:06.640]  and her husband was president of Yale University for a number of decades and I
[2:11:06.640 --> 2:11:10.480]  saw a lot of people when I was a kid I saw a lot of people come in and out of the
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:19.840]  house the Rockefellers who else Kissinger just everybody my great-grandmother
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:27.800]  was a kind of a center of influence for a large part of I would say the New
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:33.880]  England money establishment and a great woman and contributed a lot towards the
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:39.600]  towards the country and in helping to I would say build bridges between people
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:50.000]  well that's amazing I'm a flattered to have you as a listener I would see I
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:54.760]  would see Christmas cards and the like from the Rockefellers and and our
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:11:59.360]  families had houses next to each other in Seal Harbor, Maine and up on the
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:05.360]  Mount Desert Island and the story goes that John Dee's son proposed to my
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:10.880]  great-grandmother but she that she turned him down and married the famous
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:15.760]  psychiatrist who went on to become the president of Yale loved my great-grandmother
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:22.280]  a whole bunch great great woman over the last 25 years I've been very involved
[2:12:22.280 --> 2:12:26.120]  in growth investing predominantly and we were early investors in Starbucks coffee
[2:12:26.120 --> 2:12:31.480]  and Amazon.com I've called two market tops in the last decade notably the one
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:38.760]  in 2000 and the one in 2008 and in the bear markets of 2000 through 2003 our
[2:12:38.760 --> 2:12:42.840]  clients made money from those declines and our clients made money from the
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:48.760]  declines of last year we are essentially trend followers meaning that we're
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:54.040]  looking to ride the prevailing wave whatever that might be. Okay well I want
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:13:00.280]  to get into sure fire our websites for us. We have a couple websites I guess
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:06.480]  DamonVickers.com would be stuff about me and then our other site for our fund
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:14.000]  management would be www.npmnancypolmary.us would be concerned the fun stuff.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.520]  Well let me ask you this question because I don't normally want to sit here and
[2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:20.480]  talk about myself here but but you're a big analyst why are you listening to
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:24.200]  this show you're a busy guy I mean are you listening to try to see with the
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:29.360]  grassroots what the trends are or is it just an interesting show and why are you
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:33.800]  coming out on TV and increasingly others are as well and talking about
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:39.240]  reality the world government the global currency the end of the dollar. Yeah well
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:43.200]  I mean one of the number one that one of the things I mean I did radio myself for
[2:13:43.200 --> 2:13:46.720]  about five years and your approach guy I think that's Peter Reeve I know Peter
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:51.840]  Reeve and I like your I like your show I like your you've got a great feel to it
[2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:57.080]  a great energy great pacing I can't say I agree with everything you say on the
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:02.840]  radio show but you put on a really good radio show you know people I think like
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:08.440]  like yourself Alex they're looking down a tunnel you know some people may see
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:12.760]  you know light approaching coming down that tunnel and yet there may be some
[2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:17.320]  people that say no that isn't light that's actually a 100 ton locomotive
[2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:23.720]  heading your way. Now the person that says that will usually be
[2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:27.280]  called crazy oh you must be you know you don't know what you're talking about
[2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:32.560]  you know no one necessarily listens to you at the moment and when you're
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:38.040]  making you know calls like that but the evidence cannot be the evidence could
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:41.720]  not be ignored there is kind of a momentum there is a kind of a there is a
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:46.280]  trend in terms of global developments and there is a trend in terms of where
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:52.080]  things are moving towards some of those things you know my father talked about
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:56.800]  you know my father worked for the the Institute of World Affairs for a brief
[2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:02.520]  time and he would take people back and forth like Henry Kissinger like others
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:07.120]  and they talked about this was well over 20 years ago maybe 25 years ago they
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:13.080]  would talk about dividing the world basically into three geographic
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:18.600]  trading zones and I get I you know listening to my father at the time I
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:23.640]  probably thought he was nuts but you know now we see we see the Asian trading
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:28.680]  zone we see this is before the euro and we see the United States moving closer
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:33.960]  towards that as well so well that's the trilateral Commission model stated by
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:36.760]  them and then I would read their own documents on air and people would say
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:41.040]  that's never going to happen and and reading over their strategic plan and
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:43.880]  now it's come out with Goldman Sachs betting against the housing market
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:48.760]  secretly while they were you know telling the public to invest in it
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:53.600]  clearly this is command destruction a lot of these groups at the apex of the
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:59.720]  pyramid they're getting a lot of power a lot of control out of these crises which
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:05.840]  they understand in advance right well you know there's I mean we there there
[2:16:05.840 --> 2:16:10.720]  are problems beyond that I mean I mean yes before I agree with you um yes
[2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:14.080]  before me why are we why have I gone on the air and said that you know when I go
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:19.000]  on the air I really don't try to prep everything that I'm going to say I mean
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:23.560]  I you know I think if the more you prep your comments the more dead the
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:27.020]  interview becomes and I've looked forward to our interview together and I
[2:16:27.020 --> 2:16:29.960]  thought well how much prepping am I going to do a little prep but the more I
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:35.760]  prep the more candid it sounds so when I made those comments and you may want to
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:41.440]  reply them I basically said that that I thought that the world was moving in all
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:45.560]  likelihood towards some type of a currency crisis and I do believe that
[2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:51.400]  that it feels like we're moving towards that in the the into that currency
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:55.400]  crisis you're gonna have people that are going to be pretty panicked there's
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:58.920]  going to be kind of a panic okay not not just a global not just the United
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:02.720]  States panic because if the dollar really comes under pressure and I don't
[2:17:02.720 --> 2:17:06.880]  mean just going down in dribs and drabs I mean you come in on a Monday morning
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:13.080]  and the dollar is down 10 15% overnight it's not just going to be the dollar
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:16.200]  that's affected it will likely be other currencies that are also affected
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:22.160]  simultaneously okay they're kind of a domino effect and that could be kind of
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:27.400]  destabilizing on a global basis it will cause kind of a panic how would a
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:33.400]  if if what would the world or what would global powers do in response to that
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:37.000]  well if you had a total lack of confidence and all that they the first
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:40.520]  thing that they would do is they would raise interest rates so you'd see this
[2:17:40.520 --> 2:17:45.320]  ratcheting up immediately of interest rates to try to defend their currencies
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:52.440]  that and all likelihood won't work and then what you have is the dollar still
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:56.080]  goes down it doesn't matter how high they they raise their interest rates
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:17:59.960]  people just don't want them and they just don't want dollars they also just
[2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:03.320]  don't want pounds they just don't want all of those because there's utterly
[2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:09.000]  nothing backing any of the global currencies they're literally want them
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:12.920]  just piece of papers not even paper currencies are made out of linen but
[2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:17.480]  there's just nothing behind them but if there's a currency based on taxing
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:21.600]  energy like the cap and trade or carbon tax is that going to be one of the new
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:26.480]  units and then of course commodities themselves oil gold pork bellies well
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:29.600]  it's a good point I don't know about park pork bellies but it's a good point
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:33.080]  about the commodities I mean that assumes that they're willing to do that
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:38.000]  you need some type of a method of exchange that everybody can
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:43.280]  agree to that so that global trade can be facilitated if there's if there's no
[2:18:43.280 --> 2:18:48.600]  agreement that global currencies are that you run into a panic then they have
[2:18:48.600 --> 2:18:53.600]  to supplant those currencies with something and it's into that breach and
[2:18:53.600 --> 2:18:59.680]  into that moment of despair from a global population whereby you would likely
[2:18:59.680 --> 2:19:04.080]  get a meeting of I would guess maybe the G20 at this point or something like
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:07.960]  that and the proposal would be put out there to that we've come together in
[2:19:07.960 --> 2:19:13.880]  this crisis and out of this crisis we've probably decided to to form a new an
[2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:17.880]  alignment basically and they would align themselves and they would align
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:25.320]  themselves behind a new I would imagine a new currency and the and and if we're

[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:49.720]  World Order where you see the markets going where you see gold going how you
[2:24:49.720 --> 2:24:53.160]  see this crisis shaking out of it I know you don't have a complete crystal ball
[2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:57.800]  nobody does but your best dead reckoning on where we're going but when you talk
[2:24:57.800 --> 2:25:02.640]  about New World Order talk about global government studying that how do you see
[2:25:02.640 --> 2:25:07.720]  it forming what do you see it making up what do you see its policies being well
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:16.240]  hot that it's a that's a that's a big one to cover on you know I there there's
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:20.200]  there's a there's a kind of a there's a trend which is what we do I mean I'm a
[2:25:20.200 --> 2:25:24.880]  trend follower so that the trend for the markets last year we're down we want to
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:27.800]  make money from that we really don't care which direction the market goes
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:31.080]  market wants to go higher great we want to be there the market wants to go lower
[2:25:31.080 --> 2:25:35.200]  great we want to be there gold I got really excited about gold when it broke
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:38.920]  through a thousand dollars an ounce I also got we had gotten a long oil at the
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:43.080]  same time both assets are going up we're making money making money in both of
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:46.560]  them and we're doing real really well with it today because as we speak gold
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:51.440]  is hitting a new high and oils up at $3 a barrel when I saw that happening it
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:54.880]  went what I think this is the same thing that was happening last year when I
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:59.120]  saw the break last year in the financials there was a there was a
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:06.120]  week last year where the banking index broke support I sent out a release to
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:09.680]  all the media and that the title of that release was called on the eve of
[2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:15.280]  destruction the week that followed that we had the worst week in market history
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:20.000]  went down like 20 some odd percent of the week it was horrific for most great
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:24.360]  for us and we made money that week when I saw a gold break through a thousand
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:29.360]  dollars that kind of felt like a tell to me that this would also involve the
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:34.360]  currency so it which is the dollar which we've also seen so gold breaking through
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:40.240]  a thousand really says that the dollar is likely to come under increasing
[2:26:40.240 --> 2:26:44.360]  increasing pressure the dollar coming increasing pressure means an
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:50.160]  accelerated loss of value and an accelerated rise in the price of gold
[2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:54.480]  so we are basically short the dollar I guess by being long gold we're basically
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:59.120]  short the dollar by being long oil what investors can do is they can they can
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:04.240]  buy some gold it's in a bull market and and in a bull market you want to buy it
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:07.320]  on weakness if your time arises long enough it probably doesn't matter where
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:10.760]  you buy it but it's one of the things that you can do to kind of protect
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:17.480]  yourself because the loss of purchasing power for Americans may be really
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:21.680]  profound you know what we know about the dollar we know that the dollar already
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:29.900]  Alex as I'm sure you know the dollar has lost about 97% of its value since 1971
[2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:37.440]  since Nixon cut the you know cut the cord to the dollar plus 97% and so you
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:40.600]  know the government has done all these things to try to shore up the economy
[2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:44.720]  right it you know we had the equity bubble in 2000 and then the burst and
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:47.720]  extra big they go together well what can we do to keep this all going and what
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:51.280]  do they do they printed money they deregulated the financial system we
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:55.480]  had a separation between banks and brokerage firms right because we've
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:28:01.440]  learned lessons from the crash of 1929 but we dissolved that and banks and
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:06.240]  brokerage firms got together banks could then make risky bets with your
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.240]  deposits which is exactly what they did and this was all to juice up the
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:15.480]  economy in 2002-2003 so we juiced up the economy and we created the second
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:20.560]  bubble which was the real estate bubble and you can blame the Wall Street you
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:24.800]  can blame the investment bankers the mortgage industry Anthony Mazzillo we
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:29.200]  were short countrywide last year but you could also blame the participants the
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:32.400]  general public they've got a little too euphoric they got a little too excited
[2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:36.000]  about real estate and flipping houses and you know all that kind of stuff they
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:39.840]  took the bait they took the bait they sure did they swallowed it and it was
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.320]  very toxic and now here we go again last year we have a meltdown where we're
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:48.880]  like you can no longer there are no more suckers left to buy those crazily
[2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.480]  priced insanely priced houses there's just nobody left they've tapped into
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:58.240]  every fool on the street to give them a no money down five mortgage and then we
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:01.920]  run into a crisis there's basically there's no more sources of funding left
[2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:08.560]  last year was a crisis of funding you could no longer find anybody took to
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:12.360]  finance the economy because that's what we were doing we were selling these
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:17.400]  these these swaps on a global basis we almost bankrupted Iceland or virtually
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:22.080]  did bankrupt the country and you know we look at Madoff and say he was a
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:26.800]  horrific guy and the guy was no saint it's a very evil thing but here the
[2:29:26.800 --> 2:29:33.800]  United States and here we as Americans we have floated out this toxic garbage to
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:40.440]  the entire planet to finance our illusion illusion of a lifestyle let's talk
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:44.160]  about that let's talk about that on the other side quick break we'll come back

[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:04.120]  okay going back to Damon Vickers and we were getting in to the new world order
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:09.080]  what's being set up what you see happening in the future tell me where
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:13.240]  do you how high do you think gold may go what's the time frame there and then
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:16.280]  you were posing the question to meet her in the break well we're gonna have a
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:19.520]  new world order I mean you're saying the dollar is pretty much gonna collapse a
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:23.400]  new system but who's gonna run that new world order so David Vickers break it
[2:36:23.400 --> 2:36:28.840]  down yeah one of the things that you say Alex that that I love amongst a
[2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:31.600]  mother thing you talk about there there are those that that are kind of
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:36.640]  conservative clones and you know they're a couple them on the radio and there are
[2:36:36.640 --> 2:36:40.720]  a number of people that are there the other way and that neither the
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:46.280]  Democrats nor the Republicans are worth anything that it's a total fantasy one
[2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:52.600]  way or the other that we participate in every four and eight years and so it's
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:55.880]  not working the other thing is that that you know that there is not the
[2:36:55.880 --> 2:37:01.600]  historically all paper currencies have historically lost all their value in that
[2:37:01.600 --> 2:37:06.640]  as the as the problem is that as that the as a population and the
[2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:11.640]  government's unfold basically what they they they do is we keep on that we wrote
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:17.120]  in people that just give out all this largesse to the general population you
[2:37:17.120 --> 2:37:22.240]  know we the population wants to continue to pile on all these pennies and
[2:37:22.240 --> 2:37:27.360]  benefits and special projects and it's not just the United States it's all
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:31.440]  over the planet and the way that we do that is it's very easy since there's
[2:37:31.440 --> 2:37:36.640]  since the currency right it's not based on anything to just print money so the
[2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:40.680]  currencies get debased they get and inevitably they get the currencies
[2:37:40.680 --> 2:37:46.640]  basically get wiped out there is a kind of a long-term historical cycles that
[2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:51.120]  that we seem to go in which is you get this debasement of the currency and a
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:55.440]  kind of a laissez-faire environment which I think the speculation of the last ten
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:37:59.360]  years with the internet and the crazy you know real estate bubbles and the you
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:02.800]  know taking point of putting Donald Trump back on TV which was if there was
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:05.880]  ever a sign of the new world order and the sign of the apocalypse maybe it was
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:10.880]  Donald coming back to life and and then you get the arrival you get into
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:16.040]  cent disintegration of the government disintegration of order right of kind
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:22.240]  of chaos and then desperation of the general population and then the arrival
[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:33.240]  of a focused focal point or a kind of a more of a fascist national kind of a
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:36.720]  dictatorship really you know you saw it with the arrival of Adam Hitler
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:40.760]  Mussolini this type of thing I know it's hard to imagine that we could see
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:45.680]  anything like that in the United States but it's a possibility and so what we
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:50.440]  need to do is decide whether or not if this is going to be a controlled landing
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:55.280]  right or it's going to be a total utter crash well let me throw this in
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:02.760]  because David I mean Damon Vickers the whole issue here is speaking of David
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:06.200]  David Rockefeller and others have stated what their plan is they have
[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:10.640]  implemented this implosion Maury Strong talks about implementing this
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:15.160]  implosion on its ashes to build the new international architecture they're
[2:39:15.160 --> 2:39:19.560]  telling the public none of this change exists while the UN secretary general
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:23.280]  rights editorials calling for global government and global carbon taxes so
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:27.080]  that we're not part of the debate they're just denying it's even happening
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:31.880]  while in serious intellectual debate it's all being erected and set up right
[2:39:31.880 --> 2:39:38.240]  now and so my problem is one of their higher level sales pitches they use is
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:41.920]  to say oh the question is what type of world government what type of new world
[2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:45.120]  order do you want well how about we have a new world order where we don't have a
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:48.120]  world government how about we have a new world order where the central bankers
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:52.600]  engineering these Ponzi schemes go to jail how about we have a new world order
[2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:56.480]  where we have a global declaration of independence and national sovereignty
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:01.360]  instead of being maneuvered into well okay then do you want to have a say in
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:04.840]  what type of new world order are we going to have the elite setting up this
[2:40:04.840 --> 2:40:09.200]  system won't even allow a real debate they ridicule anyone that you know
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:13.680]  limbaugh Hannity they still won't even admit this is happening after decades of
[2:40:13.680 --> 2:40:18.360]  saying it doesn't exist I mean you understand where I'm going with this
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:23.720]  we don't have a say in how this government changes and understand it sold
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:27.360]  as an evolution and a new world order but the new world order has been
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:31.720]  engineered go ahead okay that we can debate things add in front of them and
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:34.720]  yet nothing will get will get accomplished and nothing will get done
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:40.520]  you you you we're all afraid of change we're all afraid of things arriving that
[2:40:40.520 --> 2:40:46.120]  we don't know anything about but I think we have to all agree and admit to
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:51.920]  ourselves that the present order of things the order of wiping out fish
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:56.400]  stocks the order of wiping out you know the resources and everybody believes
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:01.040]  that they have the sovereign right to rape and pillage their their their
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:07.080]  forests and their their their you know the the world's nature which I know but
[2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:12.760]  the globalist always say I know but the globalist always say they're doing this
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:19.080]  to stop it when they are the progenitors of most of it well I I think
[2:41:19.080 --> 2:41:24.840]  there's there's there's a desire for those that there is a desire for certain
[2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:29.600]  people to try to bring order to a world that is entirely disorderly and headed
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:36.160]  towards what could be unfathomably about suffering we've got a billion people in
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.120]  the planet right now Alex better they're starving right now a billion of them
[2:41:40.120 --> 2:41:43.600]  that's a very large percentage of the population we can look in the United
[2:41:43.600 --> 2:41:47.680]  States how many people are what do they say one out of five kids families are
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:51.560]  in food stamps right now they really clearly the order that we have right
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:56.360]  now is not working we need them and something new I understand that there
[2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:00.000]  are a lot of problems and crises but when I read the Royal Commission on
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  populations secretly put out with the British government now declassified 50
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:07.680]  years ago they said we're going to create globalization to control the third
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:11.240]  world we're going to keep them from industrializing even though that would
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:14.520]  clean up the environment and lower their numbers because we're going to let the
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:18.960]  people bomb the use as a weapon against them just like the UN claims we never
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:21.800]  should have we never should have gone into the third world in the first place
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:26.320]  and every time that we go in there we create more havoc even the compassionate
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:30.600]  things that we do in terms of providing aid and care to them only further
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:34.320]  exacerbates the problem and it just gets worse and let me just say this I
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:39.960]  totally understand where you're coming from when you say the existing order is
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:44.520]  a bunch of criminal pirates raping and pillaging and looting the problem is
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:50.120]  this is where we this is where we agree this is where we agree Alex but it's a
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:54.480]  two-faced you've got two faces one here and one on the back the globalist are
[2:42:54.480 --> 2:42:59.040]  the are the pirates they then rotate their face around as the saviors and
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:03.320]  and everything they're proposing just gives them more power and has this
[2:43:03.320 --> 2:43:09.240]  frosting this this sugar coating of of helping the poor and helping the
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:12.120]  environment when I mean they wanted to help the environment they'd be
[2:43:12.120 --> 2:43:16.600]  restricting genetic engineering well you talked about David Rockefeller and I
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:22.280]  know it's convenient to demonize the Rockefellers okay but we wouldn't have
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:27.200]  much of the national park system in the United States if it weren't for Lawrence
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:30.640]  Rockefeller would be no Teton National Park there'd be no U.S. Virgin Islands
[2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:35.800]  National Park there'd be no Acadia National Park there'd be no I mean the
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:40.680]  list goes on and on these are people that long ago made a tremendous amount of
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:47.040]  wealth and then they began to turn their their their wealth to greater causes and
[2:43:47.040 --> 2:43:51.920]  trying to serve humanity I think all of us would agree that we that it that is
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:56.560]  that that none of us like seeing suffering and it to the extent that we
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:03.560]  can move the planet towards alleviating human suffering and more balance I think
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:07.880]  we're heading in the right direction hey Damon I appreciate you coming on and I
[2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:12.040]  want to have you back up again because this is intriguing but this is the slick
[2:44:12.040 --> 2:44:16.240]  New World Order sales job because I recognize what you're doing I've heard
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:20.480]  this from other high-power making a sale hold on but I've been given this
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:24.640]  speech before hold on I've been given this speech before what I'm telling you
[2:44:24.640 --> 2:44:31.220]  is the fruits of the people captaining our planet right now are look the
[2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:34.960]  Rockefeller set up eugenics the Rockefeller set up CPSing people's
[2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:38.640]  children and the family courts they set up the human genome project in Cold
[2:44:38.640 --> 2:44:43.640]  Springs Harbor I understand they also set up some of the national parks because
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:47.200]  they wanted places where there were no people
[2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:55.720]  that's good well you know what do we do we are our nation the United States
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:45:02.800]  enjoys a very high standard of living many of us sit around on lazy boy chairs
[2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:07.600]  we we fill our we fill our faces with macaroni and cheese and we and the
[2:45:07.600 --> 2:45:12.160]  evening we watched the newlywed game and and ridiculous program we medicate
[2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:17.440]  ourselves right and we do this with debt that we set we voice onto our own
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:22.600]  Ponzi yes we're we're a we're an obese decadent society that won't even engage
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:26.880]  in birth control so we just abort our babies we're a throwaway society and so
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:31.160]  now we're being thrown away by the global system how fair is how fair is
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:36.760]  that that that we in the United States live that way and then you've got people
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:44.960]  in India in Bangladesh in Vietnam that are living in in in making 97 60 cents
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:51.120]  at 67 cents an hour with members of their family starving to death while we
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:56.360]  live this way is that compassionate well I'll tell you this a lot of them are
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:45:59.560]  doing hold on a lot of them are doing better now than they were just 20 years
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:03.840]  ago great because of the limited but that's the globalist sales pitch is
[2:46:03.840 --> 2:46:09.320]  guilt to what's left of the middle class here when really forget about the
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:13.920]  guilt but then our money what's left of us gets transferred to the to the bankers
[2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:17.800]  it doesn't get to some african note no desire to do that we we've got a pot
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:21.120]  we've got a rising unemployment rate and the reason why we have a rat rising
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:25.840]  unemployment rate is we simply cannot match the unit cost to the labor cost
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:29.920]  the unit cost of production that can be achieved in vietnam and bang and create
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:33.080]  teamwork you know we're about how does lowering our standard of living when it's
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:38.120]  all fiat to begin with how does that help Africa and Asia and Latin America
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:40.920]  that's actually going to hurt them because they're not even going to have
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:44.360]  their customer anymore this is how globalization and the and the giant
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:50.000]  sucking sound the race to the bottom destroys all sides in the end except for
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:55.320]  the finance oligarchs well if we don't try to create some type of a balance
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:47:00.000]  globally Alex we will be right let me ask you this let me ask you this then
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:02.920]  because you are an honest guy we'll talk about the truth on national television
[2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:09.920]  what do we do then if Damon vickers was steering things what would you do well
[2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:15.640]  I think we have to we have to create we have to create a global environment
[2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:20.600]  whereby even even is whereby we have balance and that's essentially the
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:25.640]  problem I think on a planetary basis we're living out of balance our own
[2:47:25.640 --> 2:47:31.120]  our own country is out of balance we cannot go in and and take a million tons
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:34.920]  of herring out of the ocean and know that it doesn't affect the whales you know
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:38.680]  and they should be the oceans are really running out of fish right now but but the
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:42.600]  issue here is again I want to go back to this the issue is realizing that that
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:47.360]  heaven is is a place that that that is a that that is something that we that is
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:52.240]  that the closest our fondest imagining of what heaven is it's here on our planet
[2:47:52.240 --> 2:47:55.920]  we need to take care of the planet that we live in and not be raping it and
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:00.720]  think it's ours to exploit it we have to sustain our home and we're not treating
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:04.240]  it respectfully well I'll tell you there's putting a tax on putting a tax
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:09.680]  putting a tax on carbon isn't gonna do that respectfully either on the planet
[2:48:09.680 --> 2:48:15.200]  but Damon putting a tax on carbon dioxide is a giant distraction from real
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:19.520]  environmental policies that we could agree to carry out and make profitable I
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:22.840]  mean I mean I mean the government that we have in place right now is a total
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:27.520]  disaster this whole move towards health care and is it is just insane it's just
[2:48:27.520 --> 2:48:32.760]  making it that our government has become a giant tumor tumor that is sucking the
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:37.440]  life out of this country it's horrific yeah these are these are not easy these are
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:41.000]  not but Damon that's my point is the same globalist that brought us into
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:45.440]  imbalance certainly nudged us in that way using our own weaknesses to get us
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:50.520]  dependent on them they got us dependent in this largest decadent laissez faire
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:54.920]  welfare system so that we could be controlled I have their own documents
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:59.640]  they brag that they engineered this and then now they're offering the solution
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:03.560]  that sounds somewhat similar to what you're saying I'm saying the problem is
[2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:11.200]  it's a setup well I I'd say that the participants also set themselves up I
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:14.480]  mean you're gonna you're talking about it you've got an addict and you've got a
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:20.320]  drug dealer or and there's no doubt that there's a there's a dealer
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:24.520]  establishment but the addict is also partly to blame for their own behavior
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:27.880]  and yeah well I agree to you I mean I agree to a certain extent but that's
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:31.400]  like saying a 10-year-old who gets kidnapped it's partly their fault and
[2:49:31.400 --> 2:49:34.560]  it is true they went in the front yard they went down the street they talked
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.320]  to strangers they wanted to see the puppy dog that's there that's a terrible
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:42.240]  analogy you know we got real challenges ahead of us that the dollar is
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:45.640]  disintegrating we know that that's what's currently happening right now the
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:50.160]  dollar is is losing value like pretty much every day that the market is open
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:56.280]  is a day to sell more dollars gold is rising oil is rising and it's not just
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:49:59.800]  the dollar that's under this week it's also the current season the United
[2:49:59.800 --> 2:50:03.160]  Kingdom and it's also the other westernized nations because none of
[2:50:03.160 --> 2:50:08.600]  these countries are really a really viable viable going concerns we don't
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:13.960]  export anything and and we and we can't produce things globalism did this to us
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:19.600]  tax incentives to move overseas I know but we were set up we were pushed into
[2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:26.480]  this big government did this well I think it's just it's it's it's kind of a
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:31.720]  cycle of how societies run I know I agree with you how high is gold going to
[2:50:31.720 --> 2:50:37.560]  go good question it could absolutely go through the roof I mean it could go to
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:43.000]  three four thousand dollars an ounce start to say the trend is up and what
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:49.320]  is it trending towards over two thousand the next 12 months this is an
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:53.680]  incredible interview Damon Vickers I'm gonna try to twist his arm maybe 10 15

[2:54:14.840 --> 2:54:20.280]  the midnight rider I tell you this is an impressive interview and I look
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:26.520]  forward to future debates with him we really appreciate Damon vickers Damon
[2:54:26.520 --> 2:54:30.640]  vickers calm coming on with us he is the chief investment officer with nine
[2:54:30.640 --> 2:54:36.880]  points management research and he's one of the nicer formerly East Coast blue
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:41.800]  bloods here hooked up with the Rockefellers and others and he is
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:47.280]  talking about the world government coming in and he is talking about the end
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:52.000]  of the dollar and we're gonna when we start the next hour take your calls for
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:57.640]  all of you that are holding a shanky Andrew Karen Anita and others but but
[2:54:57.640 --> 2:55:02.320]  just briefly we were talking during the break you're saying look I grew up in a
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:05.320]  Buddhist monastery or lived in one I'm not beelzebub that was a joke I
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:09.800]  apologize I just meant I just meant you speak with a silver tongue and and I
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:14.320]  understand it's very convincing argument but but are are you saying world
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:19.440]  government is a foregone dad my dad left Goldman Sachs gave up all of that
[2:55:19.440 --> 2:55:23.680]  all gave up the Brooks Brothers gave up all that stuff and I would sit and
[2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:27.480]  meditate with my father at 5 30 in the morning I lived in a monastery called
[2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:32.400]  Odeon I'm one of only three kids that ever lived there it's on 1100 acres and
[2:55:32.400 --> 2:55:36.920]  it's a Tibetan Buddhist monastery but for real and what they're all about is
[2:55:36.920 --> 2:55:42.520]  trying to alleviate human suffering so I all of us would agree that what that
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:45.760]  suffering is something that we want to avoid and that we don't like seeing
[2:55:45.760 --> 2:55:49.520]  others yeah but you're saying the system's bad we've got now do we like
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:55.320]  seeing our planet suffer and that we are living we are living out of balance and
[2:55:55.320 --> 2:55:59.960]  and and that we need to get not only the United States back into balance but but
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:04.920]  the world back into balance as Prince Phillips says we need to call Prince
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:10.240]  Phillips says we to call 80% you're not for calling people are you no I'm not
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:13.720]  for calling people but on but on the other hand you've you've got you've got
[2:56:13.720 --> 2:56:18.640]  if you're a if you're a West Indian down in the Caribbean you think it's your
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:23.800]  right to have 28 kids and they do I've met them and it's not sustainable many
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:27.360]  of many of those islands in the Caribbean are they were paradise and now
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:31.840]  they're not paradise at all let me ask you this then let me ask you this here's
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:39.120]  the deal here's what I have to say to you though that's why I made
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:44.040]  in-game blueprint for global enslavement my film about eugenics because I agree
[2:56:44.040 --> 2:56:47.960]  with you that we should have a debate about this and people should know all
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:51.280]  these people eating McDonald's hamburgers living in trailers partying
[2:56:51.280 --> 2:56:55.960]  watching porn and having abortions they don't realize that the elite have
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:57:00.760]  decided to kill their butts so I mean I'm just glad that you're just being
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:04.160]  honest about all this I'm not saying you're calling for killing people you
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:07.280]  know you're kind of the soft touch in all this but I'm telling you this is
[2:57:07.280 --> 2:57:10.560]  that this this is real and the public better grow up and get off their fat
[2:57:10.560 --> 2:57:17.200]  butts our planet cannot support every every one of us going out there and
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:22.680]  having 24 and 28 kids it's just there's not enough there they're it's not
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:28.120]  sustainable there's another problem only educated people are dying out the West
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:34.560]  has 1.3 replacement for every two adults and so the West is saying they want to
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:38.720]  target the West for no one to have kids so the West has to die and then
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:43.000]  everybody else can have 500 kids now we have nobody needs to be targeted but we
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:47.840]  all we need to recognize and come into common understanding and belief about
[2:57:47.840 --> 2:57:52.120]  what our relationship is to one another and what and what our
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:55.480]  relationship is to the planet that we live on and try to live responsibly and
[2:57:55.480 --> 2:58:01.640]  having 16 and 28 kids is not responsible I think all of us could agree to that
[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:06.880]  wouldn't agree on Alex but the minute you don't let somebody have 10 kids then
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:12.120]  you can't have two okay and there are nations that want to believe it's
[2:58:12.120 --> 2:58:16.400]  their right to to deforest their rainforest but these are the lungs of
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:20.040]  the planet should they be allowed to do that because they're sovereign right well
[2:58:20.040 --> 2:58:24.560]  the nations that's the oil that's the oil companies and Al Gore owns
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:28.640]  Occidental Petroleum he didn't call him for stopping that he wants to tax what
[2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:32.840]  plants breathe that's what I mean is that we're just evil and no matter what
[2:58:32.840 --> 2:58:36.280]  we do it's going to hell in the handbasket and all these globalists
[2:58:36.280 --> 2:58:39.600]  have these great reasons we should sell out to them but that brings more
[2:58:39.600 --> 2:58:46.880]  destruction stay with us thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN
[2:58:46.880 --> 2:58:53.280]  live calm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[2:58:53.280 --> 2:58:57.560]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:58:57.560 --> 2:59:01.840]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[2:59:01.840 --> 2:59:05.640]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:10.160]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:59:10.160 --> 2:59:14.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:18.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:59:18.600 --> 2:59:22.920]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:26.640]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:59:26.640 --> 2:59:30.800]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:59:30.800 --> 2:59:34.200]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[2:59:34.200 --> 2:59:40.320]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:45.000]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[2:59:51.840 --> 3:00:11.200]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:16.640]  we're going right to your calls but Damon Vickers wanted to make one more
[3:00:16.640 --> 3:00:22.480]  point before we do it go ahead sir no I just wanted to say I mean I am four I
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:29.320]  am four people and I'm four you know joy and happiness and love to be a greater
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:35.560]  abundance of this on this planet and to do that I think we have to I think we
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:40.600]  have to elevate our consciousness to realize that that we're all connected
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:46.040]  and that we're all a part of the same family the human family and we have to
[3:00:46.040 --> 3:00:49.880]  respect one another and we can only sometimes the only way that you can
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:54.760]  actually even get to that point is through some type of a crisis or an
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:00:59.920]  event that brings us together but Al Gore they're now saying is our global
[3:00:59.920 --> 3:01:03.560]  priest president of the world that's in the newspaper today let me tell you my
[3:01:03.560 --> 3:01:08.080]  discernment I don't think he has enough charisma quite frankly to be that but
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:13.240]  okay this guy that sold us on NAFTA and GATT now wants me to pay carbon tax
[3:01:13.240 --> 3:01:19.360]  that this apple breathes to him so I'll all be safe I mean I'm just saying you
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:24.000]  know this guy's the head of the New World Order I ain't buying it I doubt that's
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:30.640]  true a giant demonic Nelly I mean come on man this is not my this is not my
[3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:35.720]  company listen let's go to let's go to shanky and George is shanky quick go
[3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:41.200]  ahead thanks it's been a great conversation and I really enjoyed it
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:44.320]  because I'm right in the middle of both of you because I'm right I'm on Damon's
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:49.160]  side on the a lot of things and yours on the other to get to Damon and what he
[3:01:49.160 --> 3:01:53.320]  does for a living out there right now there are a lot of top callers he's
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:59.560]  done very good in the past at calling tops we can all see the top coming now
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:04.800]  and you talk about riding the trends and the trend is your friend and and but
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:10.360]  the the the crash of the dollar I'm a big proponent of this to wrestle this
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:13.880]  market away from the manipulators at this point in time that it's going to
[3:02:13.880 --> 3:02:18.360]  take some type of external event and and could it be the crash of the dollar you
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:22.320]  know people are talking about wars whatever can I get your opinions on that
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:27.680]  real quick yeah I I mean that the trend the trend for the dollar is decidedly
[3:02:27.680 --> 3:02:33.600]  lower trend for gold oil obviously decidedly higher do we need some type
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:38.160]  of an event yeah I mean I mean ultimately I the war thing I mean
[3:02:38.160 --> 3:02:42.400]  ultimately you I think what you're saying is ultimately do we does the
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:47.120]  government create some type of a global distraction to juice the dollar well
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:50.200]  we've done that a couple of times in the past I don't think they're really at
[3:02:50.200 --> 3:02:55.800]  that right now I think their mindset is that a lower dollar juices exports is
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:59.320]  good for the economy and because they're not innovators because Obama's not an
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:04.760]  it is not and he's not a he's not a an entrepreneurial genius he's a very
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:11.000]  well-spoken politician to deliver some credible speeches so I hope I really
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:17.360]  really really really profoundly hope that it doesn't take some type of a global
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:23.960]  war for us to revive the economy of us exporting military machinery over into a
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:29.640]  you know a you know kind of an apocalyptic but the ran corporation is
[3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:31.920]  saying that's what they need and that looks like where they're moving the
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:36.160]  next two years with Iran I hope not I really hope not Damon you bring up a
[3:03:36.160 --> 3:03:38.720]  key point here though the numbers are in
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:43.200]  manufacturing's down even with a weaker dollar that should boost it that doesn't
[3:03:43.200 --> 3:03:48.640]  bode well for the why howl strategy no it doesn't work it I mean they were
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:52.480]  destroying the dollar I mean inevitably doesn't work there's an end game and the
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:57.000]  end game is that you don't have a currency at all and then that get
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:05.120]  replaces and that gets replaced with SDRs or a basket of currencies or a new
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:10.800]  global cashless thumbprint system well I don't know that we're moving towards a
[3:04:10.800 --> 3:04:15.640]  thumbprint system I mean I think that we that we that if you see that the
[3:04:15.640 --> 3:04:22.640]  countries and and that have things like oil like resources Australia South
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:27.920]  Africa Canada and I know there was I misquoted when I made that comments about
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:32.080]  Canada not having resources Canada has a lot of resources on their currencies are
[3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:35.880]  doing terrific the United States we don't have that stuff we don't have
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:41.640]  anything to export except promises which is our you know our promises to pay off

[3:07:13.840 --> 3:07:18.720]  I've turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:23.520]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:27.880]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:33.160]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[3:08:38.680 --> 3:08:43.000]  covered yet coming up in the next segment let's go back to the calls let's
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:48.280]  talk to Andrew in Missouri you're on the air Andrew go ahead yeah I don't mean to
[3:08:48.280 --> 3:08:53.320]  uh you know derail the conversation because I'm loving it but I just want
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:56.680]  to know what's up with silver because I don't hear much about that
[3:08:56.680 --> 3:09:03.240]  silver's good great glad glad to called Andrew on silver's fine it's it's not
[3:09:03.240 --> 3:09:07.800]  quite as strong as gold on when you're trading markets you're investing in
[3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:11.560]  markets you're always going to have the weaker sisters meaning that there's the
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:16.360]  strong market and then there's the also ran my strongest advice to you and
[3:09:16.360 --> 3:09:21.640]  remember this is that it's generally a bad idea to buy the weaker of the
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:27.200]  markets you want to buy strength and sell weakness silver has always traded
[3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:31.120]  less than the gold I know the flock being that it'll it'll it'll rack up a
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:34.920]  greater percentage stick with the strongest market always buy the strongest
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:40.840]  market does that go for natural gas is being a week second to oil you got it
[3:09:40.840 --> 3:09:47.160]  man natural gas has been in this this deep dive in price for months and months
[3:09:47.160 --> 3:09:51.000]  and months and months you would have thought if energy is bottoming why not
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:55.760]  buy natural gas it's cheaper it only got cheaper natural gas has been
[3:09:55.760 --> 3:10:00.840]  horrific year-to-date so and silver's not doing the same thing I'm just saying
[3:10:00.840 --> 3:10:05.520]  it's an ongoing process stick with the best so you're saying nothing succeeds
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:11.400]  like success why buy yahoo when you can buy Google the big one has a larger
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:17.200]  gravitational economic pull and is always gonna accelerate mass at a faster
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:21.880]  clip yeah Google I mean something may inevitably displace Google but you don't
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:25.920]  see on the horizon right now but yeah you want to stick with the best of breed
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:30.920]  and be willing to pay up for it don't buy the also ran and on the contrary to
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:34.840]  that if you're looking to make money from a market going down sell the weakest
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:40.040]  sell the weakest market okay does that answer your question Andrew yeah yeah
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:43.920]  usually you know I've heard I don't know if it's true but I heard silver was
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:51.200]  15 to 1 you know 15 ounces of silver by one ounce of gold in the past yeah it
[3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:54.960]  may be and but you sound like a person that's long silver that's seeking to
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:10:59.880]  justify their position how much silver do you own me and I'm just you know I'm
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:03.120]  just getting into it I've heard you know that's the next best thing is silver
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:08.760]  so I'll say this it is the natural gas thing and and you okay you're gonna buy
[3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:12.320]  energy you believe that energy is gonna benefit from the dollar and you buy
[3:11:12.320 --> 3:11:16.800]  natural gas I mean and it just goes down on you so if you're looking to make
[3:11:16.800 --> 3:11:21.520]  money from a decline in the dollar and a rise in metals and more tangible real
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:26.880]  stuff my suggestion would be to own the gold yeah and to be prepared to buy it
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:30.280]  on weakness because there will be some weakness at a time and I believe in
[3:11:30.280 --> 3:11:35.880]  diversification so I think I've always told people 70% gold 30% silver that's
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:40.120]  just my layman's of you on it and and also silver for the poor man somebody
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:45.560]  didn't have a lot of money that's good to get into because you know some people
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:48.800]  think it's not gonna be as volatile I mean I mean who knows but I think the
[3:11:48.800 --> 3:11:52.360]  diversification but obviously you're more of an expert than I am on that let's
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:57.560]  talk to Karen in Oregon Karen you're on the air with Damon Vickers go ahead thank
[3:11:57.560 --> 3:12:01.840]  you Alex I think maybe his grandmother didn't marry Rockefeller because she
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:07.360]  heard about the John Rockefeller that went in and hired thugs to murder people
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:12.320]  in Ludlow the miners who were actually opposed to the horrific conditions they
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:17.120]  had not to mention the Rockefellers donated the United Nations the eugenics
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:20.880]  that you talked about and if you want to talk about natural gas I think demon
[3:12:20.880 --> 3:12:26.680]  right there is certainly full of it nice nice I like that well it isn't demon
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:35.440]  it's Damon the bear swipes at the Rockefeller family I'm glad that I
[3:12:35.440 --> 3:12:39.880]  can go to Katie a national park because of other Rockefellers I'm glad that the
[3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:46.000]  the the the US Virgin Islands Park exists I'm glad that the Teton parks
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:52.240]  exist and I think they've made many many good contributions to the planet well
[3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:56.400]  Damon let me say this I know there's a lot of fear out there and and all the
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:01.600]  stuff that you said I'm against certainly I mean let me just say this
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:06.960]  the Rockefellers are a diverse family but the big prime movers are really bad
[3:13:06.960 --> 3:13:10.920]  news I mean I've seen editorials by David Rockefeller praising Mao Zedong in
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:14.440]  the New York Times we have that in my film in game but I don't think we need
[3:13:14.440 --> 3:13:20.720]  to set a daemon up here as as David Rockefeller he was simply
[3:13:20.720 --> 3:13:25.440]  yes we're not we're not interviewing though I heard a phone conversation at
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.880]  Bilderberg that was recorded but the guy in the hotel wouldn't let me use it
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:35.480]  where he called up David Rockefeller at Bilderberg 2008 and had a long
[3:13:35.480 --> 3:13:38.640]  conversation with him in the morning and it was David Rockefeller they called
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:44.800]  his room at 6 a.m. and he and it was like talking to mr. Burns from from the
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:50.280]  Simpsons but you know the problem is as you get rid of David Rockefeller it's
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:54.400]  like shark teeth there are other people out there pushing this same system but
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:59.920]  and the man is quite advanced in age anyway so you may be hearing his passing
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:05.080]  on literally any day now but I was gonna add Hitler set up national parks and
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:09.720]  loved animals so just because you know question to apparently please buy his
[3:14:09.720 --> 3:14:13.640]  own account yes and a broken clock is right twice a day a blind hog can
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:17.120]  occasionally find troubles I mean you know that you know to sit there and say
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:21.440]  well no I mean to sit there and say that the Rockefellers occasionally do
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:26.920]  something good I mean it's it's you know what though you've got the courage to
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:30.160]  come on here and you're telling the truth on television we just appreciate
[3:14:30.160 --> 3:14:33.760]  Damon Vickers for coming on this show let's take a few more calls let's talk
[3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:39.280]  to does you have anything else to add Karen okay she's gone let's go to Anita
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:46.920]  in Texas Anita you're on the air with mr. Vickers I just wanted to actually the
[3:14:46.920 --> 3:14:51.680]  lady before me took pretty much the words right out of my mouth I was gonna say
[3:14:51.680 --> 3:14:56.200]  the same thing you said just now to Alex that you know they did they do a few
[3:14:56.200 --> 3:15:00.720]  good things probably for their own benefit and have done but that doesn't
[3:15:00.720 --> 3:15:05.640]  make up for the things they have done bad and are doing and are planning to do
[3:15:05.640 --> 3:15:10.440]  and if they were really for the environment help an environment and
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:14.640]  everything like that then they they wouldn't be they would look in their own
[3:15:14.640 --> 3:15:20.920]  backyard at the things they do like jet jetting all over the the country and
[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:25.840]  having all these servants and just like the queen has people who watch her butt
[3:15:25.840 --> 3:15:33.360]  you know yeah the groom of the stool has a number of servants they're just
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:37.800]  located in a different country like Bangladesh Vietnam or India I mean what's
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:42.400]  that number maybe 20 30 to 1 how many people over in the third world are needed
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:47.200]  do you imagine it takes to support our lifestyle here how many doops around the
[3:15:47.200 --> 3:15:50.800]  world how many countries around the world do we have to basically plunge
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:55.720]  into economic chaos to support our standard of living well let me say
[3:15:55.720 --> 3:16:02.800]  this by the world and tell them our worthless debt the bankers but but but
[3:16:02.800 --> 3:16:07.600]  mr. Vickers with Anita again just because he's a successful businessman is
[3:16:07.600 --> 3:16:10.920]  talking about the new world order specifically though you can ask him
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:14.840]  financial questions he does have pretty good advice do you have any any questions
[3:16:14.840 --> 3:16:18.840]  about let me ask this question how high do you think the stock market's probably
[3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:24.240]  gonna go before it starts going down the great question on well we're coming up
[3:16:24.240 --> 3:16:27.720]  as we speak today the markets have actually been really strong and it
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:34.200]  looks like we're breaking the downtrend of the two thousand and seven peak
[3:16:34.200 --> 3:16:38.800]  meaning that we've hit this line a number of times and the markets may break
[3:16:38.800 --> 3:16:42.960]  that downtrend if they do a lot of the people that have shorted the market in
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:46.160]  recent weeks thinking the market was overbought will be forced to cover and
[3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:51.520]  then we go higher your question how high will it go in theory we could go all the
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:56.440]  way back up to the highs of 2007 I know that it make people feel a lot better
[3:16:56.440 --> 3:17:01.480]  and of course we'll go out and spend some money on however it's an illusion
[3:17:01.480 --> 3:17:06.040]  because that while that's happening the dollar is probably going lower so they
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:10.480]  may actually be no nothing so it's like endorphins flooding the brain as you're
[3:17:10.480 --> 3:17:17.680]  dying it's a suckers rally until we meaningfully break out and what I
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:22.160]  mean by meaningfully break out I mean this market not only goes up but it
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:27.040]  takes out the two thousand and seven highs on that this is all kind of
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:32.000]  interesting game to watch and the only way that can happen is the
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:37.600]  arrival of a social trend an adoption cycle and an investment cycle it told
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:40.880]  the bull market whereby we start creating some employment is there any
[3:17:40.880 --> 3:17:46.760]  down in gold is there any I mean you see any way it's gonna plunge well I don't
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:49.360]  know that it's I don't know that it's gonna plunge but there certainly could
[3:17:49.360 --> 3:17:55.440]  be days there could even be weeks where gold does go down I would from a trading
[3:17:55.440 --> 3:18:00.960]  standpoint I would be watching that thousand dollar level as kind of our
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:06.240]  risk management point is that if gold breaks below a thousand significantly
[3:18:06.240 --> 3:18:09.720]  we have to watch that but on the long graph you believe it's only going up
[3:18:09.720 --> 3:18:14.360]  for the foreseeable future I think the trends on gold are very very strong I
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:20.800]  think we'll see 1350 1400 that we may even see okay well beyond that real
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:24.600]  quick call from Kyle in Pennsylvania Kyle you're on the air with Damon Vickers
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:30.900]  yeah I got a question like today for example we see that GM's lost 1.8
[3:18:30.900 --> 3:18:36.200]  billion retailers are cutting their inventory for the 13 months in a row
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:42.440]  and yet the stock market goes up 150 points and the net that's up 13 I mean
[3:18:42.440 --> 3:18:46.280]  doesn't that clearly show that these markets are either manipulated yeah
[3:18:46.280 --> 3:18:50.680]  that's what he's saying go ahead markets I mean there is a working there is a
[3:18:50.680 --> 3:18:54.320]  there is a plunge protection team there is a working group that does step in
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:19:00.760]  to either stabilize or from periodically to move the markets the what you're
[3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:04.800]  seeing today is is not is not manipulation people are buying based
[3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:08.560]  upon the decline in the dollar and liquidity that's that it that's finding
[3:19:08.560 --> 3:19:14.200]  its way interest rates are very low if you're only getting 1% or 1.5% or 2%
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:19.000]  on a CD what doesn't it make sense to be in in assets that are perhaps even
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:23.480]  yielding closer to 5% so we got to cut it there we got to cut it there thank you
[3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:27.240]  Kyle I'll take more calls coming up I tell you you gave us an hour and 15

[3:21:01.680 --> 3:21:06.520]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[3:21:06.520 --> 3:21:11.200]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[3:21:11.200 --> 3:21:15.080]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have
[3:21:15.080 --> 3:21:19.520]  turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really
[3:21:19.520 --> 3:21:24.320]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[3:21:24.320 --> 3:21:28.680]  citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:33.960]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[3:21:33.960 --> 3:21:38.280]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[3:21:38.280 --> 3:21:41.760]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[3:21:41.760 --> 3:21:47.000]  check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:52.680]  have seen a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[3:21:52.680 --> 3:21:58.080]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[3:21:58.080 --> 3:22:03.200]  prison planet dot TV this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:07.520]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[3:22:07.520 --> 3:22:11.800]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:15.440]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:19.600]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:22:19.600 --> 3:22:24.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:28.800]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:32.960]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:22:32.960 --> 3:22:36.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:39.960]  challenges number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[3:22:39.960 --> 3:22:43.120]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[3:22:43.120 --> 3:22:46.760]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[3:22:57.080 --> 3:23:06.240]  1-877-327-0365
[3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:35.240]  Watch me, watch me, I got it, watch me, I got it, hey, I got something that makes me want a shot, I got something that tells me what it's all about, I got a soul and I'm super bad
[3:23:36.240 --> 3:23:44.240]  I got a soul and I'm super bad
[3:23:44.240 --> 3:23:52.240]  Now I gotta move, that tells me what to do, sometimes I do
[3:23:52.240 --> 3:24:01.240]  Now I gotta move, that tells me what to do, sometimes I feel so nice, I wanna try myself a few
[3:24:01.240 --> 3:24:07.240]  Now I got soul and I'm super bad
[3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:12.240]  I love, love to do my thing
[3:24:12.240 --> 3:24:23.240]  Damon Vickers, interesting interview, you know I don't think he's an evil person or a bad guy and he is a regular listener and I quiz him during breaks
[3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:35.240]  That's why Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger group came on this show and during the breaks tried to convince me about globalism and the New World Order and that it was a foregone conclusion so I might as well have my voice heard and all of it
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:46.240]  and that's the thing, you can talk to these guys and they'll admit it's all going on and then the rest of the mainstream media says it doesn't exist so we can't even have a real debate about it
[3:24:46.240 --> 3:24:53.240]  and that's because there's a lot of different people that, he doesn't even really believe in globalization, he's saying it's happening so what are we gonna do?
[3:24:53.240 --> 3:25:09.240]  But that's almost a mind trick of capitulation to it, but I appreciate him giving us an hour and 20 minutes and I'm excited to know we can have him and others back on the show so you can get the speech I've gotten many times from people of his similar ill
[3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:30.240]  Now, a little bit more extreme globalist, Aaron Russo in his final interview, final videotape interview I did with him that we made into a film, Reflections and Warnings, he talks about Nick Rockefeller going look everybody's gonna have microchips and our chips, the elite's chips are gonna say kiss my butt
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:45.240]  He told him this a decade ago and how they're gonna reduce the world population as soon as their world government's in place, well I have government policy textbooks by the White House science are like he goes science saying the same thing
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:26:04.240]  And they really believe this is for everyone's own good, but what it turns into is total corruption in the nightmare, if you go back and look at all the things the New World Order crowd have engineered and carried out it's horrible
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:29.240]  And if you look at California that series of articles that were in all their major newspapers in the last couple years where over a million police and state employees and others are above the law their license plates cannot be read by the license plate reading software that all of our license plates get read by
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:41.240]  They're exempt from the law, just like illegal aliens, the globalist when illegal aliens here to drive down wages to globalize the US, I'm not against the illegal aliens, but I know they're being used as a tool
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:49.240]  I'm not against water, I love water, I like swimming in it, but I don't want somebody to cram a fire hose down my throat and blow my guts out
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:56.240]  I don't want to have my arms bound and a bowling ball tied to me and be thrown into the Atlantic Ocean
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:10.240]  So see, I don't dislike the illegal aliens, but they are a bottomless pit of third world labor that will drive down the wages and destroy their future and my future and my family's future
[3:27:10.240 --> 3:27:21.240]  So I'm forced to speak out against them and I can't sit here and make the decision for third world populations that are having five, six, seven kids, most of them aren't having 20
[3:27:21.240 --> 3:27:28.240]  The average of the third world is about four, on average they have about six kids, but two of them die
[3:27:28.240 --> 3:27:41.240]  These things will balance out, there's been major studies put out the earth can take 10 billion people, the world population is trending to start dropping at 8 billion in 2020
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:52.240]  Certainly we have a lot of dirty technologies that are hurting the earth, but you cannot allow this elite group to covertly spike your vaccines, spike your water and do this
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:28:03.240]  But then the elites argument is always, well, Alex, aren't the people guilty of this? The information you have is public, but they don't care
[3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:12.240]  And there is an argument there, you know, he said, well, somebody who gets conned, they were part of the con, people that took these loans on houses they couldn't pay back
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:25.240]  Aren't they part of the fraud too? And my analogy is, yeah, a seven or eight year old kid who just disregards their parents' warning and goes out in the front yard and talks to the man in the van that has the puppy dog
[3:28:25.240 --> 3:28:38.240]  Or the little kid that's with them, they use the lure of the other kid, yes, that five, six, seven, eight year old, nine year old, they are guilty of not listening to their parents and they should get in trouble
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:46.240]  Do they deserve to be hogtied and raped for six weeks and then have a snuff film made of their head being macheteed off? No
[3:28:46.240 --> 3:28:52.240]  They don't deserve to be raped and have their head macheteed off with a machete
[3:28:52.240 --> 3:29:04.240]  And once you buy into, oh, we've got to stop human suffering with a global government, it will fix it, you have fallen to the new world order
[3:29:04.240 --> 3:29:11.240]  And that's why this film Reflections and Warnings is so important, people that see it are like, man, this is really informative
[3:29:11.240 --> 3:29:20.240]  Because I'm in it, separate little clips, video clips, documentation, and then you see the stuff Aaron Russo said two and a half years ago before he died
[3:29:20.240 --> 3:29:24.240]  When he was getting cancer treatment in Houston, so much of it has come true

[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:10.240]  And we should be exporting excess populations to the stars
[3:34:10.240 --> 3:34:14.240]  The elite have made the decision to exterminate most of the world's population
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:23.240]  All because they don't want you to have access to the life extension technologies
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:26.240]  I don't like them charting the future of the world
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:29.240]  And I don't like their responses back to us
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:32.240]  Of, well, the public doesn't care
[3:34:32.240 --> 3:34:35.240]  They want to play video games and watch UT Longhorns
[3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:40.240]  Because the establishment has forced Fed it down their throats in a feedback loop
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:51.240]  And I said earlier I was gonna play the head of health and human services clip
[3:34:51.240 --> 3:35:00.240]  Where Kathleen Sebelius is bragging publicly about ORPR campaign
[3:35:00.240 --> 3:35:06.240]  And children's television shows and movies to take the swine flu shot is really working
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:09.240]  That is only the tip of the iceberg
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:16.240]  Last week we played clips from Fox News where they bragged Fox TV itself
[3:35:16.240 --> 3:35:21.240]  That they are propagandizing in every TV show, in every movie, in every program
[3:35:21.240 --> 3:35:23.240]  For the global carbon tax
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:26.240]  And then you have the White House going back many White Houses
[3:35:26.240 --> 3:35:27.240]  But it's getting bigger and bigger now
[3:35:27.240 --> 3:35:30.240]  And you have the General Accounting Office stating it's illegal
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:33.240]  Taking hundreds of billions
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:34.240]  Hundreds of billions
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:39.240]  Bush spent 8 billion just on the no-child-left-behind propaganda
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:43.240]  And didn't tell you that sitcoms and dramas and radio and newsprint
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:49.240]  Fiction, non-fiction was lying and spinning and paid for
[3:35:49.240 --> 3:35:52.240]  Most TV is now paid for lying propaganda
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:55.240]  I don't know how Jesse Ventura's TV show is gonna get on the air
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:35:57.240]  If it's actually anti-New World Order
[3:35:57.240 --> 3:35:58.240]  He swears it is
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:00.240]  I've looked at some of it, it looks pretty good
[3:36:00.240 --> 3:36:02.240]  We'll see if that even happens
[3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:06.240]  This was him hint-hinning last week that it may not even make it on the air
[3:36:06.240 --> 3:36:10.240]  Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows
[3:36:10.240 --> 3:36:12.240]  Perhaps we should cue this up too
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:13.240]  See, here's the problem
[3:36:13.240 --> 3:36:15.240]  I don't want to just play a couple clips here
[3:36:15.240 --> 3:36:17.240]  And then make you think I'm putting on all my evidence
[3:36:17.240 --> 3:36:19.240]  I have hundreds of clips
[3:36:19.240 --> 3:36:22.240]  Not just where they're admitting it, but where they're engaging in it
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:25.240]  Suddenly Al Gore is on half the dramas and TV shows
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:28.240]  And Saturday Night Live is the priest, the savior
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:30.240]  If you don't go for the global carbon tax
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:33.240]  To kill Africans, when it's the globalists that are actually
[3:36:33.240 --> 3:36:36.240]  Implanting the vaccines with the HIV
[3:36:36.240 --> 3:36:38.240]  And their argument is, well if we don't kill them
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:40.240]  They'll be even more suffering
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:43.240]  Then it comes out in the times of London
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:49.240]  The world's rich, secretly meet to discuss population reduction
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:53.240]  And it is disgusting how the general public hears this
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:36:57.240]  And has an automatic denial program implanted in their mind
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:00.240]  To just say, none of it exists, none of it exists
[3:37:00.240 --> 3:37:03.240]  When I'm here telling you the secrets of the world
[3:37:03.240 --> 3:37:06.240]  I'm here telling you what's really going on in the controller's minds
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:09.240]  I'm reading their documents, I spend the time
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:13.240]  I'm here telling you that a horrible nightmare is being set up
[3:37:13.240 --> 3:37:17.240]  By a bunch of true believers
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:21.240]  And their argument is almost
[3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:24.240]  Proven by the fact that you want to be killed
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:27.240]  You want to drink sodium fluoride
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:30.240]  Hundreds of chemicals they put in your water
[3:37:30.240 --> 3:37:32.240]  To give you cancer and sterilize your butts
[3:37:32.240 --> 3:37:35.240]  And do you see people marching on the city hall of Austin, Texas
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:39.240]  Where I have probably 100,000 plus fans and listeners?
[3:37:39.240 --> 3:37:41.240]  No!
[3:37:41.240 --> 3:37:43.240]  I would have to beat the drum for a month
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:47.240]  To get 10,000 people to go down there and have them ignore us
[3:37:47.240 --> 3:37:51.240]  It needs to be every day, it needs to be 100,000 of you
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:54.240]  And it's the same for other places around the country
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:37:59.240]  We have got to prove to the elite that we are part of the decision-making process
[3:37:59.240 --> 3:38:03.240]  Because in their weird psychology, they say, hey, we've told you what we're doing
[3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:07.240]  You don't care, therefore it's fair game
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:10.240]  There's another issue, too
[3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:15.240]  Globalists are always saying, join us, join us, join us
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:20.240]  If I've been approached 50 times, I bet Ron Paul's been approached 500 times
[3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:25.240]  I've been taken up on the mountain many times and offered great power
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:28.240]  But it means nothing because I know it's evil at its core
[3:38:28.240 --> 3:38:31.240]  I'm not delusional, I know it stinks
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:35.240]  My scam meter goes off the chart just looking at Al Gore
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:37.240]  Much less understanding him and researching him
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:40.240]  That just verifies what I already knew
[3:38:44.240 --> 3:38:49.240]  But they have this weird rule where they've got to tell you what they're going to do to you
[3:38:49.240 --> 3:38:53.240]  It's like fair game, it's like they're saying, prepare for battle
[3:38:53.240 --> 3:38:59.240]  It's like you're in a ring with a shield and a sword and they hit their sword and shield together and say
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:05.240]  On guard, on guard, get on guard, I'm going to kill you
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:09.240]  I mean, they're gentlemen, they say, on guard, I'm going to kill you
[3:39:09.240 --> 3:39:13.240]  On guard, I'm going to build a technological police state grid and then we're going to kill you
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:17.240]  Do you see all our police massing around you, brainwashed and ready for blood?
[3:39:17.240 --> 3:39:20.240]  Do you see all the surveillance? Do you see how we're imploding your economy?
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:25.240]  On guard, on guard, and the public's like, cheeseburger, I like it
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:28.240]  You know, just like that Alex Jones is a nut
[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:32.240]  And I'm going, they're saying on guard, they're saying on guard, they're attacking
[3:39:32.240 --> 3:39:36.240]  They're attacking my god, they just gave 45% of the women in this country
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:41.240]  In one African country, HIV, my god, these people are devastators
[3:39:41.240 --> 3:39:44.240]  And the general public's like, did you hear about the UT horns?
[3:39:44.240 --> 3:39:48.240]  Did you hear about the Winter Olympics coming up? And I'm like, yeah, that's real neat
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:53.240]  I understand the UT horns, you should drop everything you're doing to fight these people
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:56.240]  To speak out against them, to at least address them
[3:39:56.240 --> 3:40:03.240]  If you can't even address them with real evidence, then they say that's proof that you're subhuman and deserve to die
[3:40:03.240 --> 3:40:11.240]  If you can't even man up and face the situation we're in and address the elite, they won't even talk to you
[3:40:11.240 --> 3:40:14.240]  They think it's cute and funny, I'm on the air
[3:40:14.240 --> 3:40:16.240]  They think it's cute and funny, I'm here warning you
[3:40:16.240 --> 3:40:20.240]  Because they think you're dogs and that you're not going to wake up
[3:40:20.240 --> 3:40:25.240]  And they say if you did wake up and actually addressed them, then they might do something else
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:30.240]  But I know their nature, that's not really the case, it's like a little game
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:34.240]  Alright, let's play some of these clips and go to some final calls here for people that are holding a mic
[3:40:34.240 --> 3:40:36.240]  Elizabeth, John, Lamont, and Jason
[3:40:36.240 --> 3:40:38.240]  But I'm going to go to your calls, you got to go quickly
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:44.240]  The first clip is the Health and Human Services Secretary bragging about how great the propaganda is going
[3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:49.240]  And the White House now admits they're propagandizing on global warming, on anti-gun
[3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:51.240]  This is all going on right now
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:59.240]  You need to be aware this isn't a free or healthy society when your tax money is used to take over TV, radio, and media
[3:40:59.240 --> 3:41:01.240]  Here it is
[3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:06.240]  In just a moment
[3:41:06.240 --> 3:41:08.240]  Here it is, it's loading now
[3:41:08.240 --> 3:41:11.240]  For the latest news on H1N1, go to vacproof.com
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:13.240]  That's who posted this
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:16.240]  Ranking Member Collins and members of the committee
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:24.240]  I am pleased to have a chance to appear with my colleagues and give you an update at this critical time
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:30.240]  And I would start by echoing what Secretary Napolitano has said
[3:41:30.240 --> 3:41:38.240]  The collaboration and cooperation of the not only the three of us representing three critical sort of frontline agencies
[3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:42.240]  But across this government has been remarkable
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:51.240]  And we have had wonderful results also with state and local partners, tribal partners, private sector
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:55.240]  We are continuing to focus on mitigation
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:42:00.240]  In the meantime, there's still some fairly simple steps that people need to take
[3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:08.240]  Social isolation, staying home when you're sick, washing hands, coughing and sneezing into arms
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:16.240]  I've been very impressed that children are listening to ELMO and they are correcting their parents in terms of sneeze technique
[3:42:16.240 --> 3:42:24.240]  And we are doing everything we can think of with our partners in terms of the communication effort
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:30.240]  Not only using traditional media, but we have great partners in Sesame Street
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:36.240]  And Sid the Science Kid where the secretary and I will launch a new program today
[3:42:36.240 --> 3:42:44.240]  Facebook, Twitter, ESPN that runs the scores, scrolls into college dorms
[3:42:44.240 --> 3:42:49.240]  Is a partner in encouraging that age group to get the vaccination
[3:42:49.240 --> 3:42:58.240]  We've had YouTube videos, so we are trying to get the word out to folks that vaccination is the best defense against this flu
[3:42:58.240 --> 3:43:04.240]  And the good news is I think it's beginning to become available around the country
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:12.240]  Okay, now that was Kathleen Sobellis who I guess had a stye
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:18.240]  So she was like one eyed like Sauron, they're staring out at people, did you catch it?
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:24.240]  Not only are they admitting they're brainwashing your children, we're going to play one of those clips right now from PBS
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:26.240]  Paid for by the government
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:30.240]  Do you notice she said the young children are correcting their parents
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:38.240]  Remember Al Gore in all these middle school, high school and elementary school speeches, he says correct your parents, they're wrong
[3:43:38.240 --> 3:43:45.240]  And then the New York Times had those articles where the seven-year-old writes fake tickets to their parents
[3:43:45.240 --> 3:43:51.240]  And now at schools in the US, UK and Canada, they give them little ticket books to write their parents up
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:55.240]  This is how they're inducting us into the 1984 society
[3:43:55.240 --> 3:44:02.240]  The state is taking over your children right in front of you, that is absolute total tyranny you just saw
[3:44:02.240 --> 3:44:06.240]  That should enrage all of you
[3:44:06.240 --> 3:44:11.240]  You should have all your children out of public schools immediately, you shouldn't be letting them watch television
[3:44:11.240 --> 3:44:18.240]  The state is taking over the family and telling your children to tell you what to do
[3:44:18.240 --> 3:44:23.240]  It doesn't get more Nazi or Soviet or Maoist or Hitlerian than that
[3:44:23.240 --> 3:44:30.240]  Now here's one of the brainwashing programs she mentioned and notice the nurse laughs when she goes
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:34.240]  It'll hurt a little but it'll help a lot
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:42.240]  They're even letting you know the sterilization because there's too many of you, it may hurt a little but it'll help a lot
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:44.240]  Here it is
[3:44:44.240 --> 3:44:50.240]  Ooh, stopping that virus lets our goals, oh come on everybody, we're getting the shot
[3:44:50.240 --> 3:44:55.240]  It might hurt a little bit, just a little bit, but it's gonna help a whole lot
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:59.240]  This vaccination is a great opportunity
[3:44:59.240 --> 3:45:04.240]  Yes it is, yes it is, to do something for yourself and your community
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:10.240]  Yes it is, yes it is, the virus won't spread if we don't let it
[3:45:10.240 --> 3:45:15.240]  So roll up your sleeves and come and get it
[3:45:15.240 --> 3:45:18.240]  If I don't get the virus I won't give it to you
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:21.240]  If you don't give it to me I won't give it to her
[3:45:21.240 --> 3:45:24.240]  If I don't get it from her I won't give it to them
[3:45:24.240 --> 3:45:25.240]  That's true
[3:45:25.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  If I don't get the virus I won't give it to you and I won't be able to have children either
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:36.240]  Children dying of cancer, so much fun, take the euthanization shot, slow kill, yeah
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:39.240]  Just a little bit, just a little bit
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:43.240]  Soft kill weapons, haha, haha, help a whole lot
[3:45:43.240 --> 3:45:50.240]  Kids, I'm ready to roll, stopping that virus, that's my goal, so come on everybody, we're getting the shot
[3:45:50.240 --> 3:45:56.240]  Let's stop right there, back it up 10 seconds, now I'm going to explain to you mammal psychology
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:45:59.240]  They study dog trading under Pavlov, the Russian
[3:45:59.240 --> 3:46:06.240]  Humans keep dogs more often than cats because we're most similar to dogs in our pack psychology
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:12.240]  Now he's the little one, he's the little one, he's the littlest one
[3:46:12.240 --> 3:46:18.240]  And remember when you're 5, you look up to the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 year olds
[3:46:18.240 --> 3:46:26.240]  So they all dance first and then he dances at the end and everyone turns and gives him attention
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:31.240]  And he goes up the chain in the pack towards alpha male
[3:46:31.240 --> 3:46:35.240]  And so the message is you'll be popular if you take the shot
[3:46:35.240 --> 3:46:40.240]  All psych warfare by the Pentagon brainwashing your children
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:46.240]  Here it is, the savage manipulation of the little puppy sees the bigger dogs in the pack
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:51.240]  But he admires, when he says I'm going to get the shot, they all suddenly turn and go
[3:46:51.240 --> 3:46:58.240]  Ah, and he's the center of everything, oh god bring me the brain damage, bring me the sterilization, bring me the cancer
[3:46:58.240 --> 3:47:03.240]  Oh god sterilize me, it might hurt a little but it's going to help a lot
[3:47:03.240 --> 3:47:08.240]  Like the White House science art says sterilizing him, let's show him getting sterilized right here
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:12.240]  He's a good member of the pack, he joins the military like all the TV shows brainwashing kids
[3:47:12.240 --> 3:47:17.240]  G.I. Joe, great American hero, go Joe, here it is
[3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:24.240]  I'm ready to roll, stop that virus, that's my goal, so come on everybody, we're getting the shot
[3:47:24.240 --> 3:47:29.240]  Might hurt a little bit, just a little bit
[3:47:29.240 --> 3:47:34.240]  Ah, ouch, there you go, ouch, stop you from breathing
[3:47:34.240 --> 3:47:43.240]  Ha ha ha ha ha, this is totally sick, let's go out to break and I'll come back and take a few final calls
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:52.240]  Let's go out to break with the parent company news core, they released this on MySpace and TV
[3:47:52.240 --> 3:47:58.240]  Bragging that they're brainwashing you, that global warming is man-made and we need to do something about it
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:06.240]  With all this fear, and then meanwhile Fox TV criticizes Ron Paul and other people
[3:48:06.240 --> 3:48:10.240]  And Kavuto and others are kind of sideways on whether it's real or not
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:14.240]  But then their publications say don't worry it's not going to pass, so you stand down
[3:48:14.240 --> 3:48:23.240]  Let's go to the next level, oh we're queuing it up right now, yeah if people want to find it, it's Fox admits to planting political brainwashing in popular TV shows
[3:48:23.240 --> 3:48:29.240]  This is from March 6th of this year, but I really think this illustrates things well for people
[3:48:29.240 --> 3:48:34.240]  Oh you guys didn't know we were going to that?
[3:48:34.240 --> 3:48:42.240]  Okay, sometimes these web videos, alright here we go, we'll go out to break with it and come back with the rest of it, here it is
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:57.240]  I want to set an example to others in our industry and other industries that no matter what the size of your carbon footprint is, you can make a difference
[3:48:57.240 --> 3:48:59.240]  I'll stay for long record
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:00.240]  Global warming
[3:49:00.240 --> 3:49:01.240]  Probably
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:06.240]  Press button to see what global warming will do in the next three years
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:10.240]  Three years is a long ways away
[3:49:10.240 --> 3:49:15.240]  What could we do on a practical level to start making a difference
[3:49:15.240 --> 3:49:21.240]  Just had another thought, what if the Scared Straight Show had a green message to it
[3:49:21.240 --> 3:49:29.240]  The biggest thing we've done is inserting messages about the environment into some of our content
[3:49:29.240 --> 3:49:33.240]  I don't follow green, it means environmentally friendly
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:40.240]  The lifeblood of our company is the quality of our TV shows and we would accomplish nothing if we compromised that quality
[3:49:40.240 --> 3:49:44.240]  Going green doesn't fit with the rest of the show
[3:49:44.240 --> 3:49:46.240]  Work your magic, make it fit
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:51.240]  Hey Brian, I'm not going to recycle this aluminum can, I'm just going to throw it in the trash
[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:54.240]  Ha! Your earth's bitch
[3:49:54.240 --> 3:50:04.240]  The most powerful way that we could communicate the commitment on behalf of our company was to change the practices within the production
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:15.240]  As well as work in a message about global warming, about environmental changes and about empowering people to take responsibility
[3:50:15.240 --> 3:50:18.240]  Why are your wedding programs bumpy?
[3:50:18.240 --> 3:50:26.240]  Seeds, we're having a green wedding so after the reception our guests can plant the programs, grow clouds
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:31.240]  I could live in the sea, I'd make friends with a whale, we'd live in a sunken pirate ship
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:33.240]  That'd show global warming
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:43.240]  We've come up with all sorts of strategies for lessening our footprint of everything from utilizing hybrid vehicles on our production
[3:50:43.240 --> 3:50:47.240]  Look at all these hummers, what kind of jerk would drive one of those?
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:50.240]  Dude, this car kicks ass!
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:54.240]  Yeah, Rumsfeld!
[3:50:54.240 --> 3:51:22.240]  We're using biodiesel
[3:51:22.240 --> 3:51:24.240]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[3:51:24.240 --> 3:51:31.240]  Liquid zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels and promoting a strong immune system
[3:51:31.240 --> 3:51:35.240]  Liquid zeolite is tasteless, odorless and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it
[3:51:35.240 --> 3:51:38.240]  Feel great again and as little as three days to three weeks

[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:06.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:52:06.240 --> 3:52:10.240]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[3:52:10.240 --> 3:52:15.240]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[3:52:15.240 --> 3:52:19.240]  They've turned immense influence on our president and Congress
[3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:21.240]  And they really are calling the shots
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:26.240]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:29.240]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:52:29.240 --> 3:52:36.240]  The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:52:36.240 --> 3:52:40.240]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[3:52:40.240 --> 3:52:43.240]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:43.240 --> 3:52:45.240]  They seem like nobody does care
[3:52:45.240 --> 3:52:50.240]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic
[3:52:50.240 --> 3:52:55.240]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[3:52:55.240 --> 3:53:01.240]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[3:53:01.240 --> 3:53:05.240]  The once mighty US dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency
[3:53:05.240 --> 3:53:11.240]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the US will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible
[3:53:11.240 --> 3:53:15.240]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar
[3:53:15.240 --> 3:53:20.240]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders
[3:53:20.240 --> 3:53:23.240]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior
[3:53:23.240 --> 3:53:27.240]  Prepare now, Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer

[3:54:06.240 --> 3:54:10.240]  We've got to jam in Mike and Elizabeth, I've got John, Lamont, Jason
[3:54:10.240 --> 3:54:11.240]  Call me back tomorrow, I'll get you on
[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:14.240]  But Mike and Elizabeth, I'm going to try to go to you here in a moment
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:17.240]  I want to thank a few of the sponsors today
[3:54:17.240 --> 3:54:19.240]  Frontsite.com
[3:54:19.240 --> 3:54:22.240]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
[3:54:22.240 --> 3:54:24.240]  The founder of Frontside Farms Training Institute
[3:54:24.240 --> 3:54:28.240]  He's offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners
[3:54:28.240 --> 3:54:32.240]  Five days of world-class gun training at the Frontside Farms Training Institute
[3:54:32.240 --> 3:54:36.240]  Here at 30 State Weapons Permit, all for pennies on the dollar, act fast
[3:54:36.240 --> 3:54:40.240]  They'll give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol and the caliber of your choice
[3:54:40.240 --> 3:54:43.240]  They've got two-day, four-day, five-day courses and a lot of free stuff online as well
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:48.240]  At Frontsite, like the front of your rifle, Frontsite.com
[3:54:48.240 --> 3:54:50.240]  Ladies and gentlemen
[3:54:50.240 --> 3:54:54.240]  Also, look, I'm not going to belabor this
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:54:56.240]  Ted Anderson is selling out of the gold
[3:54:56.240 --> 3:55:00.240]  He bought at the $1,000 level with it above $1,140
[3:55:00.240 --> 3:55:02.240]  He's selling out of this, it's done tonight
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:08.240]  Give him a call, 800-686-2237-800-686-2237
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:11.240]  He's never offered a deal, never has it been this good
[3:55:11.240 --> 3:55:14.240]  He's had a lot of great deals, this is the best
[3:55:14.240 --> 3:55:17.240]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Michigan, Mike, you're on the air
[3:55:17.240 --> 3:55:18.240]  Alex
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:19.240]  Hey, buddy
[3:55:19.240 --> 3:55:23.240]  Yeah, listen, I love your radio show and all the work you do
[3:55:23.240 --> 3:55:27.240]  And I love people like Officer Jack Mclam and Dr. Diegel
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:30.240]  But buddy, you got my blood pressure up today
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:35.240]  I can turn on CNN, Fox News, or listen to Glenn Beck
[3:55:35.240 --> 3:55:38.240]  If I want to listen to New World Order horse crap
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:42.240]  But when I turn your program on, I don't want to hear some gutter rat
[3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:46.240]  Promoting New World Order's satanic agenda
[3:55:46.240 --> 3:55:48.240]  Like I say, I'm not here to chew your rear end
[3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:50.240]  I love you, I love what you're doing
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:54.240]  But we do not want to hear some gutter rat promoting this trash
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:55:57.240]  Let me be clear with you, Mike, and just hold your horses for a minute
[3:55:57.240 --> 3:56:04.240]  I disagreed with him and I saw him on national TV admit the New World Order takeover
[3:56:04.240 --> 3:56:08.240]  And so I didn't really know who this guy was, I'd seen him on TV a few times
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:10.240]  So I got him on and we learned a lot
[3:56:10.240 --> 3:56:14.240]  And a lot of people that are in denial about this stuff are now going to awaken
[3:56:14.240 --> 3:56:17.240]  If I could get Henry Kissinger on, I would
[3:56:17.240 --> 3:56:19.240]  If I could get David Rockefeller on, I would
[3:56:19.240 --> 3:56:23.240]  I don't think this guy is consciously doing the things they're doing
[3:56:23.240 --> 3:56:26.240]  But I mean, I think it was very informative
[3:56:26.240 --> 3:56:30.240]  This is not just some religious cult where it's only one view
[3:56:30.240 --> 3:56:34.240]  I have people on here that I disagree with a lot
[3:56:34.240 --> 3:56:38.240]  And I didn't know that all that was going to happen when he was on with us
[3:56:38.240 --> 3:56:40.240]  But I will tell you, I plan on having him back on
[3:56:40.240 --> 3:56:43.240]  I mean, Mike, give me a little bit of credit that I might know what I'm doing here
[3:56:43.240 --> 3:56:46.240]  I mean, I saw the guy on TV and said, wow, let's get that guy on
[3:56:46.240 --> 3:56:49.240]  We call, he knows who I am, which shows they're listening
[3:56:49.240 --> 3:56:51.240]  And we got him on the show
[3:56:51.240 --> 3:56:55.240]  And so, I mean, I think it was very positive
[3:56:55.240 --> 3:56:58.240]  You don't normally hear that on mainstream television
[3:56:58.240 --> 3:57:02.240]  I mean, so you're saying it wasn't informative to have him on?
[3:57:02.240 --> 3:57:07.240]  No, it's that he's promoting his agenda
[3:57:07.240 --> 3:57:10.240]  And you know, it's like, I want to hear you and hear what you got to say
[3:57:10.240 --> 3:57:13.240]  And like I said, I love your show and I love your work
[3:57:13.240 --> 3:57:17.240]  But it's like, you know, I feel like, you know, it's like having Glenn back on
[3:57:17.240 --> 3:57:20.240]  What do we need to hear that trash for? You know what I'm saying?
[3:57:20.240 --> 3:57:23.240]  Oh, I would have Glenn back on in a minute
[3:57:23.240 --> 3:57:25.240]  Let's try to get Glenn back again. I'd love to have him do it
[3:57:25.240 --> 3:57:28.240]  I'd love to have him on and ask why he stabs Ron Paul in the back
[3:57:28.240 --> 3:57:32.240]  I mean, come on, Mike, I hear what you're saying, but I respectfully disagree with you
[3:57:32.240 --> 3:57:35.240]  And I would love to have, I've tried to get Rothkopf back on
[3:57:35.240 --> 3:57:37.240]  He won't come on now
[3:57:37.240 --> 3:57:39.240]  And I want to get Holbrook on
[3:57:39.240 --> 3:57:41.240]  I mean, I want to get all these people on
[3:57:41.240 --> 3:57:43.240]  I didn't exactly know where that guy was going to go with all that
[3:57:43.240 --> 3:57:46.240]  But that was a pleasant surprise getting to see all that reveal
[3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:49.240]  You know, we get to hear about Nick Rockefeller saying things to Aaron Russo
[3:57:49.240 --> 3:57:52.240]  But it's one thing to hear about, nothing to hear directly from him
[3:57:52.240 --> 3:57:55.240]  But that guy's a true believer
[3:57:55.240 --> 3:58:00.240]  Elizabeth in Tennessee, you got about 30 seconds, go ahead
[3:58:00.240 --> 3:58:01.240]  Alex?
[3:58:01.240 --> 3:58:02.240]  Yes, Elizabeth, welcome
[3:58:02.240 --> 3:58:05.240]  Hey, I'm so glad to be on with you
[3:58:05.240 --> 3:58:07.240]  I do give you a lot of credit, Alex
[3:58:07.240 --> 3:58:11.240]  I appreciate you so much and pray for you and your family
[3:58:11.240 --> 3:58:16.240]  I just also wanted to take exception with what Damon Vickers had to say
[3:58:16.240 --> 3:58:21.240]  His perception of Americans as being fat and lazy and sitting in our armchair
[3:58:21.240 --> 3:58:27.240]  I just wanted to say that Americans have worked real hard to have the prosperity
[3:58:27.240 --> 3:58:30.240]  Man, a lot of time, call me back, we'll no doubt discuss him tomorrow
[3:58:30.240 --> 3:58:33.240]  I think he was talking about a subset of people
[3:58:33.240 --> 3:58:36.240]  Obviously, we've got some of the hardest working, smartest, best people in the world
[3:58:36.240 --> 3:58:37.240]  We've got to save that
[3:58:37.240 --> 3:58:40.240]  Great job, crew, retransmission starts now, infowars.com
