[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.800 --> 00:43.760]  my friends thank you for joining us it is Wednesday the 25th day of September
[00:43.760 --> 00:52.520]  2013 and congressman senator Ted Cruz is on track to have one of the longest
[00:52.520 --> 00:57.440]  filibusters in congressional and senatorial history in fact we're gonna
[00:57.440 --> 01:02.280]  go to a live feed of him he's set to wrap it up at noon Eastern it is noon
[01:02.280 --> 01:06.480]  Eastern one afternoon right now so let's hear what could be the end because
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.280]  they're claiming under Senate rules they can shut him down now I've got to say
[01:10.280 --> 01:16.760]  folks I really respect senator Ted Cruz I didn't know senator Ted Cruz when he's
[01:16.760 --> 01:20.520]  running in Texas we interviewed him once I wish I would have gotten to know him
[01:20.520 --> 01:24.200]  better I've known Rand Paul forever so absolutely endorsed him and always a
[01:24.200 --> 01:27.640]  great guy and of course he's proving that but Ted Cruz is really amazing it's
[01:27.640 --> 01:33.760]  hard to talk for 20 plus hours and I mean my problem would be wanting to sit down
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.680]  and obviously wanting to use the bathroom they're doing closing prayer
[01:39.680 --> 01:47.120]  let's go to it here's senator Cruz the righteous avail much during this
[01:47.120 --> 01:56.640]  challenging season give our senators the wisdom to make full and complete
[01:56.640 --> 02:06.480]  their commitment to serve the American people equip our lawmakers with the power
[02:06.480 --> 02:18.000]  to clearly discern right from wrong so that integrity will govern their words
[02:18.000 --> 02:28.920]  and actions Lord make them this day sentinels on the walls of freedom worthy
[02:28.920 --> 02:39.480]  of the power and responsibility they exercise guide and sustain them in the
[02:39.480 --> 02:49.280]  great unfinished task of achieving peace justice and understanding 21 hours folks
[02:49.280 --> 02:56.040]  among all people he just finished it's being ended with a prayer we pray in your
[02:56.040 --> 03:04.720]  great name and again obviously that's not senator Ted Cruz that's the chaplain
[03:04.720 --> 03:10.880]  of the Senate let's go back now to the feet oh now Harry Reid jumps in we all
[03:10.880 --> 03:17.200]  admire the Center from Texas for his wanting to talk Harry Reid is now the
[03:17.200 --> 03:20.160]  most unpopular politician America according to Gallup sure we learned
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.240]  anything new things that he talked about have been talked about before they're
[03:25.240 --> 03:30.880]  absolutely beside themselves in fact endlessly but it's been interesting to
[03:30.880 --> 03:38.280]  watch but miss president for lack of a better way of describing this it has
[03:38.280 --> 03:46.320]  been a big waste of time shut down in a matter of hours you're trying to shut
[03:46.320 --> 03:53.840]  America down you little turds government will close and it's a shame we're
[03:53.840 --> 04:01.680]  standing here there's Emperor Palpatine wasted perhaps two days all trying to
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.320]  force a defunding of an unconstitutional bill that seventy some
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.360]  percent of Americans hate need to pass very quickly and send it back to the
[04:09.360 --> 04:17.040]  House of Representatives they're waiting for us to act this is where he acts like
[04:17.040 --> 04:21.880]  Cruz is being obstructionist when he's only trying to make them repeal a bill
[04:21.880 --> 04:28.240]  that's totally evil and totally unpopular some people's minds to delay
[04:28.240 --> 04:33.840]  and stall and try not to get anything your criminal actions before this
[04:33.840 --> 04:40.440]  president I do believe that what we have here we have a tape we're gonna come
[04:40.440 --> 04:43.480]  back and play the last five minutes of Ted Cruz speech and some of the
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.080]  highlights then all the other big news it is it's just crazy what's going on but
[04:47.080 --> 04:52.200]  we obviously covered yesterday nineteen to seventeen percent approval rating for
[04:52.200 --> 04:55.960]  government trust in government Gallup poll I think it's lower than that I'm
[04:55.960 --> 04:59.040]  telling you there's a collapse in confidence in these shy skirts we'll
[04:59.040 --> 05:03.840]  be right back the world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight

[08:08.280 --> 08:12.640]  it's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt
[08:12.640 --> 08:16.400]  ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling which
[08:16.400 --> 08:21.560]  has done been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt it does not
[08:21.560 --> 08:26.880]  somehow promote proflicacy all it does is it says you gotta pay the bills that
[08:26.880 --> 08:28.880]  you've already racked-up coppers
[08:33.880 --> 08:38.880]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[08:43.880 --> 08:49.720]  ladies and gentlemen do you know what you're seeing right now in the U.S. Senate
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.040]  and in the 50 states of our once great republic you're seeing the ghost of the
[08:55.040 --> 09:01.240]  republic rise again the question is will it fully reconstitute itself and will
[09:01.240 --> 09:08.080]  the republic like the phoenix rising from the ashes be reborn and will it be
[09:08.080 --> 09:12.720]  reborn in the fire of counter-revolution against the globalist who are
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.800]  revolutionaries and who have seized the central government and are waging war
[09:17.800 --> 09:22.920]  against the final foundations of the republic because if they can fully
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.200]  destroy those foundations it is those foundations that made this country great
[09:27.200 --> 09:34.080]  from which the spirit of liberty may rise again you saw the big Gallup poll out
[09:34.080 --> 09:42.960]  yesterday as low as 17 the average was 19 percent across the board confidence
[09:42.960 --> 09:50.720]  and trust in government Congress has a 10 percent approval rating the lowest
[09:50.720 --> 10:00.760]  approval rating in Congress is in the Senate for the man known as Harry Reed
[10:01.680 --> 10:06.320]  the Catholic Church is moving to basically ex-communicator not give
[10:06.320 --> 10:10.320]  communion to Nancy Pelosi for promoting partial birth abortion I mean that's
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.400]  just another example of all over the place different groups organizations
[10:15.400 --> 10:20.680]  are getting on the offense against evil if you won't stand up for children you
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.600]  will stand up for anybody it's just that simple but that's another issue I'm
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.800]  gonna be getting into later in the broadcast today senator Ted Cruz
[10:30.800 --> 10:37.720]  hailing from Texas so proud that he's from Texas so proud that I didn't know
[10:37.720 --> 10:40.800]  him so I didn't trust him didn't say I thought he was a bad guy so I thought he
[10:40.800 --> 10:47.640]  was a lot better than the snake that he was running against David Dewhurst who
[10:47.640 --> 10:52.960]  we know is movie bad and so we supported him but held our nose and did it
[10:52.960 --> 10:58.640]  because of some of the CFR connections via his wife we have really seen Senator
[10:58.640 --> 11:03.040]  Ted Cruz prove that he's following every promise he gave he's right up there
[11:03.040 --> 11:10.280]  with ramp all now in my mind and it takes a real man to be able to talk 21
[11:10.280 --> 11:13.880]  hours standing up not going to the bathroom not sitting down and staying
[11:13.880 --> 11:19.480]  very eloquent throughout as you could tell he was really struggling towards the
[11:19.480 --> 11:26.200]  end 21 hours and he eloquently I mean I couldn't sleep and woke up at like 4
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.720]  o'clock in the morning was watching it on the computer and I worked till midnight
[11:31.720 --> 11:34.960]  last night on the Obama deception and then went home and couldn't sleep and
[11:34.960 --> 11:40.840]  watched it and he was just speaking from the heart and eloquent and then the
[11:40.840 --> 11:45.120]  Democratic senators where they're just sniping and attacking and lying and the
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.520]  Republican leadership has been criticizing Cruz and a lot of
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.960]  Republican senators didn't supporting because they're owned by the same
[11:52.960 --> 11:57.680]  offshore banks that own the insurance companies that wrote Obama care scamma
[11:57.680 --> 12:05.640]  care fraud care double your premium care or more designed to implode the country
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.840]  because then they'll they will preside over the implosion they're the big
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.320]  mega banks and corporations that are exempt from everything it's so simple
[12:15.320 --> 12:22.000]  they shut everybody off but them that's why I talk about Warren Buffett
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.640]  lobbying for Obamacare lobbying for tax increases when he called rich people
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.440]  folks making thirty thousand dollars a year or more when he's exempt from
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.240]  everything because he's an insider on record he's exempt and the biggest
[12:34.240 --> 12:42.280]  recipient of the banker bailout personally and his company I start
[12:42.280 --> 12:46.640]  mentioning that and I literally go into a controlled rage because this is a
[12:46.640 --> 12:53.080]  criminal and he's one of the guys over Obama and it's so obvious to anyone that
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.080]  knows about history economics anything and the public still doesn't
[12:57.080 --> 13:04.880]  understand even one micron but the public does know enough now that Gallup
[13:04.880 --> 13:10.760]  as low as 17% trust in government the average of Republicans Democrats and
[13:10.760 --> 13:17.960]  independents you know they ask the questions is 19% you want to know why
[13:17.960 --> 13:23.000]  they like to stage terror attacks folks or let terrorists attack us the highest
[13:23.000 --> 13:41.400]  it's been in modern history was on 911 60% now it's 19 and falling the new
[13:41.400 --> 13:46.440]  world order with their little crown their little their little control freak
[13:46.440 --> 13:55.760]  is going down ladies and gentlemen going down fallen fast and their attitude
[13:55.760 --> 14:01.360]  is a helter-skelter attitude they say hey we're coming down fast but we're
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.360]  miles above you and that is the spirit of evil right there that we're talking
[14:06.360 --> 14:16.600]  about in that they don't care if everything's wrecked and destroyed as
[14:16.600 --> 14:24.840]  long as they're on top of it they'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven
[14:24.840 --> 14:30.840]  they think it's better to burn out and fade away when the truth is you don't
[14:30.840 --> 14:35.040]  fade away when you do the right thing humanity continues and gets better and
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.480]  you care about other people and you care about their future and you care about
[14:39.480 --> 14:45.320]  the continuum of human struggle not about the psychopathic instinct to
[14:45.320 --> 14:51.680]  dominate everything that's more beautiful or more intelligent than you a
[14:51.680 --> 15:00.400]  diseased hyper competitive gang metastasization where where gangs get
[15:00.400 --> 15:05.600]  control and rule by brute force and fraud instead of ruling by virtue and
[15:05.600 --> 15:11.880]  ruling by beauty and ruling by honor and ruling by strength and ruling by
[15:11.880 --> 15:22.560]  example and development and architecture when I look at young innocent
[15:22.560 --> 15:29.360]  children and see the disease and the and the shade of ashen death upon them
[15:29.360 --> 15:32.680]  from all the bio and chemical weapons they've been under and then I look at
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.440]  protected children that haven't had vaccines and don't have GMOs they look
[15:36.440 --> 15:39.920]  like children in old movies from the 30s and 40s they will you know they look
[15:39.920 --> 15:44.720]  happy and sweet like Hansel and Gretel compared to the walking dead we see out
[15:44.720 --> 15:48.760]  there and these parents can't even see that their kids have been absolutely
[15:48.760 --> 15:54.320]  soft killed I mean it's a twilight zone episode to go outside my office and to
[15:54.320 --> 16:04.480]  go out there and see what's happening in this world and to just witness how
[16:04.480 --> 16:14.040]  unconscious people are that that serve the system and believe it but it's less
[16:14.040 --> 16:17.760]  than 20% anyway you slice it now buy it and that's what I've been telling you
[16:17.760 --> 16:20.960]  before all these polls came out and I'm not saying that to go oh I'm smart
[16:20.960 --> 16:24.440]  listen to me I'm saying that to explain to people I know what I'm talking about
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.440]  okay I've studied history I've studied trends I've read the globalist own
[16:29.440 --> 16:35.600]  publications I am more dedicated and more focused than most people that are
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.600]  politically active and involved and I know what I'm talking about and even
[16:40.600 --> 16:46.560]  though I get up here and talk about a lot of really hardcore things on air
[16:46.560 --> 16:55.640]  I'm only telling you this information because it's the truth and I'm only
[16:55.640 --> 17:05.760]  telling you this information because only facing the full truth is going to
[17:05.760 --> 17:14.440]  allow us to turn this civilization around the good news here is that there
[17:14.440 --> 17:19.400]  is a mass awakening people are awake but just because you hear a wreck outside
[17:19.400 --> 17:23.480]  your house or you hear fire engines outside your house and you wake up it
[17:23.480 --> 17:26.720]  doesn't mean you've opened the window up and ascertained exactly what's
[17:26.720 --> 17:32.480]  happening yet so America is awake sitting up in the bed rubbing the sleep
[17:32.480 --> 17:38.160]  out of their eyes getting the glass of water off the table putting our
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.280]  collective hand on our lower back and trying to get the crick out of it and
[17:43.280 --> 17:47.440]  we need to leap up and run and open the window and see what's happening I
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.640]  already went open the window went outside 20-something years ago found out
[17:52.640 --> 17:55.720]  what was happening and I've been banging on people's doors going man there's
[17:55.720 --> 17:59.200]  World War three going on out here how can you not hear this how can you not be
[17:59.200 --> 18:03.000]  awake how can you not it be involved look at the treason look at the
[18:03.000 --> 18:07.600]  corruption look at the classical tyranny the authoritarianism growing we're all
[18:07.600 --> 18:14.560]  in danger and now finally people are really really awake but they still are
[18:14.560 --> 18:20.640]  trying to figure out exactly what's going on and we know what's going on and
[18:20.640 --> 18:29.400]  it's so deep and so nasty that one has to really marvel at it but you don't want
[18:29.400 --> 18:34.160]  to get caught like a deer in the headlights the good news is we've been
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.800]  the frontline shock trips here at info wars calm our listeners have been the
[18:39.800 --> 18:43.760]  shock trips being made fun of being attacked being demonized as the system
[18:43.760 --> 18:47.640]  desperately said we were terrorists and racist and dangerous and don't listen to
[18:47.640 --> 18:51.400]  us and we're behind terrorism and you mean you've seen it you've read it
[18:51.400 --> 19:01.360]  because the the globalists don't even want their own minions listening to us
[19:01.360 --> 19:05.440]  because their own minions are compartmentalized and they listen to this
[19:05.440 --> 19:09.200]  show they know what I'm talking about real because they're intelligent but
[19:09.200 --> 19:12.680]  they've been compartmentalized and they realized oh this is really the big
[19:12.680 --> 19:17.680]  picture and they see what sitting ducks they are and how there's no future and
[19:17.680 --> 19:20.320]  they're starting to look at their kids they're starting to look at their nephews
[19:20.320 --> 19:23.040]  and nieces they're starting to look at their family they're starting to look at

[26:55.600 --> 26:58.600]  Daniels is doing a story on this it should have already been national news
[26:58.600 --> 27:01.720]  all over the country he's a famous whistleblower from Iran contra and
[27:01.720 --> 27:06.400]  before that the church committee hearings and still flies arms for the CIA he
[27:06.400 --> 27:10.400]  was in an air base doing it yesterday and he said he talked to a high level
[27:10.400 --> 27:16.720]  NATO official Tosh Plumlee and that it was State Department shipping arms to
[27:16.720 --> 27:22.240]  there not just giving him Gaddafi arms and concurring with the analysis I had
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.000]  from Pentagon sources that are scared to come on air that it that that that he
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.080]  was ordered to be killed because of communiques where the State Department
[27:31.080 --> 27:34.680]  the ambassador was saying this is a bad idea just like the Joint Chiefs of
[27:34.680 --> 27:39.440]  Staff have said it's a bad idea on record to arm Al Qaeda but that was a hit
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.480]  folks and the military is listening they know that and we had Tosh Plumlee on
[27:45.480 --> 27:49.440]  this isn't rumors that it was an arms deal we know there were arms there now
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.360]  we told you that a week after it happened and nine months after you stop
[27:54.360 --> 27:58.520]  in a year plus but nine months after mainstream news reported exactly what we
[27:58.520 --> 28:03.920]  said my point is we don't get up here and make stuff up if we have a high
[28:03.920 --> 28:08.200]  level source that nukes came out of mothballs out at Dias Air Force Base
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.800]  and disappeared to the East Coast it happened if we tell you that the Navy

[28:22.120 --> 28:25.840]  all over the news saying exactly what I said and saying day one that's what I
[28:25.840 --> 28:31.440]  mean we don't make this stuff up and I just want you to understand when you're

[33:38.760 --> 33:44.680]  want to open the phones up specifically for callers to give us your take on Ted
[33:44.680 --> 33:52.840]  Cruz's historical 21-hour fellow buster and then we've got a central Florida
[33:52.840 --> 34:00.040]  chairman of veterans for peace which is a good anti-war group I've known Don
[34:00.040 --> 34:03.560]  Darling and others he was a submarine nuclear submarine commander here and
[34:03.560 --> 34:06.560]  Austin got to know him he's been a guest many times we should work on getting
[34:06.560 --> 34:10.920]  him back on exposing the whole police state situation and what the military
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.520]  has been turned into but veterans for peace at the grassroots has been trying
[34:14.520 --> 34:18.680]  from a left perspective but not even really left just an anti-war
[34:18.680 --> 34:23.320]  constitution perspective to impeach Obama but the head of veterans for peace
[34:23.320 --> 34:27.880]  has been blocking it so at the bottom of the next hour we're gonna have folks
[34:27.880 --> 34:34.200]  from veterans for peace come on air and expose what's going on just as Ted Cruz
[34:34.200 --> 34:38.680]  went after the Republican leadership for helping write Obamacare and for
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.280]  helping to get it passed and for being traitorous against the Constitution
[34:42.280 --> 34:45.920]  that's how you could take over the Republican Party with libertarian
[34:45.920 --> 34:51.560]  constitutionalist manned by people like Bongino running for Congress up in the
[34:51.560 --> 34:57.000]  6th district of Maryland and and so many others there are hundreds of people
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.680]  running for federal positions there are thousands running for state positions
[35:01.680 --> 35:05.640]  and winning all over the place and imagine if we hadn't gotten behind Rand
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.880]  Paul four years ago or three years ago imagine if we hadn't gotten behind Ted
[35:10.880 --> 35:15.240]  Cruz a couple years ago imagine if we wouldn't have done that if we hadn't
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.720]  gotten behind Ron Paul the libertarian option to crony capitalism and
[35:20.720 --> 35:25.000]  corruption would not be out there it's key during this collapse to point out
[35:25.000 --> 35:29.640]  who did it who was behind it show that we don't get to blame they're trying to
[35:29.640 --> 35:33.960]  blame capitalism and free market on what's happened history is replete
[35:33.960 --> 35:40.560]  capitalism and and and a real free market creates oceans of jobs oceans of
[35:40.560 --> 35:46.680]  upward mobility just cornucopia is of wealth the problem is it then produces
[35:46.680 --> 35:52.760]  decadence that's the only bad byproduct and then people become decadent and
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.240]  they become debtors they become scammers and things collapse that there is a
[35:56.240 --> 36:03.040]  problem with freedom it creates such wealth that even a small government can
[36:03.040 --> 36:07.680]  skim tons of money off the top and infrastructure and then grows into a
[36:07.680 --> 36:14.080]  monster see government knows if it cut taxes like Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.840]  one bracket 30% in the other brackets and tax receipts you can look this up
[36:17.840 --> 36:25.000]  doubled in one year doubled government doesn't want double tax receipts the
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.080]  big banks and insiders running things they're all exempt totally exempt in
[36:30.080 --> 36:34.960]  most cases are partially exempt with the loopholes the set-asides all of it
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.560]  that's on record they write the tax code so they want their competition shut
[36:39.560 --> 36:42.800]  down I cannot say that enough and I'm telling you I was talking about this
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.640]  18 years ago and only the John Birch Society was talking about it then and
[36:47.640 --> 36:53.440]  Ron Paul now I can tune in to see spend during debates and hear the few good
[36:53.440 --> 36:57.400]  senators talking just like there are more eloquent Alex Joneses I can tune in
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.800]  limbaugh is forced to join us now Glenn Beck sounds like an Alex Jones clone
[37:01.800 --> 37:08.760]  now on 90% of what he does I'm happy I'm it's wonderful I just want to beat the
[37:08.760 --> 37:12.320]  new world order I don't want to see socialism take over I don't want to
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.440]  see the family broken up I don't want to see our guns taken I don't want to see
[37:16.440 --> 37:21.960]  more agenda 21 where they shut down all their competition completely with small
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.720]  businesses absolutely hammered under taxes I mean listen I thought I could
[37:26.720 --> 37:29.520]  expand because we pay all the unconstitutional taxes because we got
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.240]  to keep our nose completely clean and I go to multiple CPAs but I do a
[37:33.240 --> 37:36.440]  conservative tax filing to make sure they can't come back after me because
[37:36.440 --> 37:42.000]  they've tried you can you imagine and they just said no all the right
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.080]  offs are gone all the loopholes are gone all of it's gone and I'm now like
[37:48.080 --> 37:50.760]  France or something because I have a bunch of employees and have bought new
[37:50.760 --> 37:55.560]  equipment tried to upgrade I'm paying more money in taxes I'm actually paying
[37:55.560 --> 38:00.240]  negative out I've gone to tax lawyers you name it they go no no no you got to go
[38:00.240 --> 38:03.920]  to the feds and try to get a waiver you got to go give money to politicians if
[38:03.920 --> 38:06.520]  you spend a hundred thousand dollars you'll get you know all these waivers I
[38:06.520 --> 38:09.480]  have to hire all these lawyers and spend millions of dollars than I'd be
[38:09.480 --> 38:17.880]  basically tax exempt I mean this country is nuts it is crazy folks just like
[38:17.880 --> 38:22.360]  France has over a hundred percent tax on middle class people go you're lying
[38:22.360 --> 38:28.720]  no that's Reuters that's AP that's Forbes a one hundred and five percent tax
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.480]  like always keep saying a hundred percent and that's incorrect see I
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.080]  tend to downgrade things because I can't believe it myself it's a hundred and
[38:37.080 --> 38:50.800]  five percent there's the headline French tax source over 100 to 105 percent and
[38:50.800 --> 38:54.720]  you're like well how do they do that because they're destroying people the
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.680]  entire socialist class is tax exempt and have Swiss bank accounts and it came
[38:59.680 --> 39:05.600]  out a year ago and no one got in trouble there are French bureaucrats that know
[39:05.600 --> 39:10.920]  that who have you know jobs making 300,000 euros a year that's tax exempt
[39:10.920 --> 39:14.520]  they actually have exemptions like Obamacare they're exempt from taxes the
[39:14.520 --> 39:17.840]  EU bureaucrats are exempt and they go well why does this politician have a
[39:17.840 --> 39:21.680]  billion dollars or a billion euros on a Swiss account and no one gets in trouble
[39:21.680 --> 39:26.560]  it's just like the Attorney General with lowest learner going after the Tea
[39:26.560 --> 39:31.680]  Party perjuring in Congress he's not going to get in trouble she's
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.120]  estimated to get over two million dollars if she just lives another 10
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.880]  years in her pension of taxpayer money she's going to get two million dollars
[39:40.880 --> 39:48.840]  two million dollars bare minimum for committing crimes and persecuting people
[39:48.840 --> 39:54.040]  like the Soviet Union I want to give out the number I want to get your take on
[39:54.040 --> 39:59.080]  10 Cruises speech and play some clips of it 800 259 9331 okay I don't screen your
[39:59.080 --> 40:04.440]  calls but man I'm opening the phones up about Ted Cruz the man of the month the
[40:04.440 --> 40:08.880]  man of the year because that let me tell you something folks I've tried to do 24
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.280]  hour broadcast and I can do it but I turn into a bumbling moron even playing
[40:14.280 --> 40:18.480]  like hour-long videos and stuff that's sitting on my butt like they say it's
[40:18.480 --> 40:23.120]  better to actually stand Ted Cruz went 21 hours was still ready to go he's gonna
[40:23.120 --> 40:28.280]  be on Limbaugh later today he literally is is manning up and going over
[40:28.280 --> 40:33.040]  everything and being funny about it at the same time it's that spirit of
[40:33.040 --> 40:38.440]  liberty it's that leadership people say oh it's too big the spy grid the torture
[40:38.440 --> 40:42.760]  grid the military has too much power the military's all waking up the police I
[40:42.760 --> 40:47.160]  know we're all waking up people decide we're just beaten by Hillary and the
[40:47.160 --> 40:51.480]  Harry Reid the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and a bunch of globalists
[40:51.480 --> 40:56.240]  most the rich people I know and I've gotten to know a lot of them over the
[40:56.240 --> 41:00.040]  years they all know about the new world order they're all upset they don't like
[41:00.040 --> 41:03.080]  the way it's going they just try to shut up because they're scared and they're
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.680]  not realizing shutting up's not gonna protect them they're all getting
[41:06.680 --> 41:10.520]  hammered people worth hundreds of millions of dollars people with
[41:10.520 --> 41:16.360]  billions of dollars and assets in Hollywood and in construction and in
[41:16.360 --> 41:21.280]  food and restaurants and companies and sports teams and you know I mean talk
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.160]  about growing up I was at Charlie Sheen's house God bless him before he went
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.680]  off the rails everything but he's better now good friend of mine a really smart
[41:29.680 --> 41:34.120]  guy when he's not focusing on the ladies and everything and in his own words he
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.280]  makes Earl Flynn look like a wimp that's not bragging that's fact I makes
[41:39.280 --> 41:44.280]  Casanova look weak the point is is that I knew Charlie back when he was married
[41:44.280 --> 41:47.760]  to Denise Richards and totally straight just drinking coffee smoke cigarettes and
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.520]  exercising and really a very smart person and of course I'm running all through
[41:51.520 --> 41:57.120]  the year since about 2005 but I remember he wanted to put loose change final cut
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.760]  in theaters and it was a real rollout through Mark Cuban's company and Mark
[42:02.760 --> 42:06.040]  Cuban was gonna put like 10 million behind it sounds like a lot it's not but
[42:06.040 --> 42:10.360]  for a rollout and to put it in theaters and he said yeah I think it's
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.320]  suspicious and I was there when he was a speaker phone conversations with him
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.560]  and then Mark calls up and he goes yeah they must be listening to my phones and
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.160]  stuff I had this problem all the time I just got a call from the White House
[42:21.160 --> 42:24.640]  they're gonna put me in jail they said they're gonna find something I've done
[42:24.640 --> 42:28.280]  in the stock market I've done anything I got a bow out of this man I mean man
[42:28.280 --> 42:33.480]  they're listening to the phones I just got threatened they didn't care they
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.360]  still went after him with the Securities and Exchange Commission over some
[42:37.360 --> 42:41.320]  $800,000 stock deal the guy was worth billions of dollars claiming you know
[42:41.320 --> 42:45.000]  that he knew about it and it was like Martha Stewart and it was it was
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.480]  nothing and it came out the New York Times the emails they even sitting saying
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.080]  we're gonna put you in jail for talking about 9-11 being an inside job and
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.000]  Cuban even rolled over and they started an SEC investigation and and told him
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.120]  and told his lawyers we don't care now he beat them but they still keep coming
[43:02.120 --> 43:07.520]  after him because if anybody gets out of line if one hand stands up they might
[43:07.520 --> 43:11.400]  all stand up now I was sworn to secrecy on that then later told I could talk
[43:11.400 --> 43:17.200]  about it once the Cuban released the email did anybody get in trouble with
[43:17.200 --> 43:23.560]  the Undersecretary of the Security and Exchange Commission the assistant to the
[43:23.560 --> 43:30.400]  head of the Securities and Exchange Commission telling him that we're going
[43:30.400 --> 43:37.680]  to put you in jail and then so arrogant sending emails saying we're gonna set you
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.360]  up and send you to jail see see see that's the thing you've got to understand
[43:42.360 --> 43:48.720]  folks is that there is an intimidation campaign going on and everyone basically
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.160]  gives into it and that's why we're in so much trouble because no one can say no
[43:53.160 --> 43:57.560]  so these crooks have unlimited power
[44:01.160 --> 44:09.200]  the truth is now though we had a major whistleblower who was on a tarmac at a
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.560]  U.S. Air Force Base with an aircraft loaded with weapons to fly to the
[44:12.560 --> 44:28.760]  Middle East Tosh Plumlee yesterday very famous whistleblower still works for the CIA because it's he's on the light side there's light side dark side and he said
[44:28.760 --> 44:32.480]  they're gonna come after me they may kill me off air he was saying yeah this is it
[44:32.480 --> 44:37.560]  but I had to do it for my family I'm 76 and I'm ready and that really happened
[44:37.560 --> 44:42.480]  yesterday he said I have the NATO source I you know he goes basically he's
[44:42.480 --> 44:45.960]  been flying in there himself I mean it's you know he says that's that's how I
[44:45.960 --> 44:53.840]  make my living but I'm not gonna be part of this arming al-Qaeda this is a guy
[44:53.840 --> 44:58.040]  been flying guns since the 50s he flew guns to set up Fidel Castro to begin
[44:58.040 --> 45:02.480]  with that's in the church hearings 1977 that guy's famous folks hadn't been
[45:02.480 --> 45:08.400]  heard from in decades gagged in 1991 by Congress just went public basically
[45:08.400 --> 45:13.200]  broke federal gag orders on air I went along with it here I am complete me in
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.880]  jail you criminals we've got to draw our line in the sand just like the Alamo
[45:17.880 --> 45:24.440]  and say you know what we're all in cards on the table let's go and if they
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.520]  kill me or somebody else folks that's just the way it is that's what it takes
[45:28.520 --> 45:34.840]  to be free that's what our forebears did that is an honor being a man didn't mean
[45:34.840 --> 45:38.880]  you go to football games and strut around and act tough being a man means
[45:38.880 --> 45:42.120]  you do the right thing you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for
[45:42.120 --> 45:45.640]  anything you've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string never
[45:45.640 --> 45:49.960]  compromise what's right and uphold your family name you've got to stand for
[45:49.960 --> 45:53.560]  something you'll fall for anything you can laugh at that cheesy country song but
[45:53.560 --> 45:59.040]  that says it all we might have been better off for lived in a bigger house
[45:59.040 --> 46:06.440]  if dad had done a little more giving in a little more backing down but we always
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.240]  had plenty you see folks the only reason we have anything is because there
[46:10.240 --> 46:13.640]  been moral people in this country there been a lot of evil people too but when
[46:13.640 --> 46:17.600]  the morals go out the door it's like the oxygen in a spaceship folks it's like
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.520]  open in the bulkhead and the new world order saying open the door open the door
[46:21.520 --> 46:27.880]  we're your friends and like crazy people were open in the door for all the
[46:27.880 --> 46:31.560]  promised goodies Obama's gonna give us and even when he cons everybody in the
[46:31.560 --> 46:35.840]  con is off he's like just follow me more you'll get the free stuff follow me
[46:35.840 --> 46:39.520]  more like here's some free food here's some free housing but we're gonna take
[46:39.520 --> 46:52.480]  your kids and give you all these shots we love you we love you there's a science
[46:52.480 --> 46:55.440]  fiction movie I can't remember the name of it where the where the woman's lost
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.920]  her kid and there's basically like these entities that are trying to trick them
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.000]  to open the open the bulkheads and stuff and she's like it's my child I've got a
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.240]  seam and she opens it up and gets sucked out in the space that's in a couple
[47:07.240 --> 47:10.360]  movies but you know that's kind of the analogy they're like come where your
[47:10.360 --> 47:15.640]  friends like sirens happy we're loving don't listen to the hateful man he
[47:15.640 --> 47:21.480]  talks in a gruff voice men are bad talking in PR voice we're friends open
[47:21.480 --> 47:26.920]  the gate open it you open the gate and a bunch of demons pour in I mean it's it's
[47:26.920 --> 47:32.120]  so incredible to see all this happening and to see history taking place right
[47:32.120 --> 47:36.200]  now I want to play a funny clip from Ted Cruz where he was doing his Darth Vader
[47:36.200 --> 47:40.240]  imitation at five in the morning after he'd already been up there for 15 hours
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.800]  or so here is a clip of him describing Obama as Darth Vader we need a rebellion
[47:45.800 --> 47:55.600]  against oppression it reminded me of a movie series that was in the theaters
[47:55.600 --> 48:01.240]  when the senator from Kentucky and I were both kids young adults and that was
[48:01.240 --> 48:06.200]  the Star Wars franchise the discussion of a rebellion against oppression I
[48:06.200 --> 48:11.520]  think it captures a lot of what's going on here and I will confess that phrase
[48:11.520 --> 48:16.240]  a rebellion against oppression conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting
[48:16.240 --> 48:21.840]  against the Empire the Empire being the Washington DC establishment and
[48:21.840 --> 48:26.600]  indeed immediately on hearing that phrase I wondered if at some point we
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.840]  were going to see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come
[48:31.840 --> 48:42.040]  forward and say in a deep voice Mike Lee I am your father oh man and I tell you
[48:42.040 --> 48:44.920]  where Ted Cruz gets at his dad obviously the last few months been given
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.840]  speeches I want to get him on the show by the way I mean really seeing how
[48:48.840 --> 48:55.720]  articulate and intelligent Ted Cruz's dad is who lived under Fidel Castro and
[48:55.720 --> 49:02.000]  it's good to see Cubans who fight tyranny instead of our Austin police
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.280]  chief whose dad ran guns to fight the Communist down there who says he's a
[49:06.280 --> 49:11.320]  big you know patriot but but goes and joins Obama to take our guns I bet
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.840]  Art Acevedo could get a position under Fidel Castro if he goes to Cuba I bet
[49:15.840 --> 49:18.360]  they can make him a police chief and he could take all the guns well he already
[49:18.360 --> 49:22.360]  took them and I'm not trying to sit here and pick fights with people but I'm sick
[49:22.360 --> 49:29.640]  of folks saying they're patriots and not being real patriots it's disgusting and
[49:29.640 --> 49:34.280]  it's time for us to stop being nice and playing patty cake with everybody we're
[49:34.280 --> 49:37.720]  gonna start the next hour here in about 10 minutes then I'll go to Sean and Dave
[49:37.720 --> 49:42.400]  and Chad and Robert Mill and everybody's take on that I want to play after the
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.560]  break last four or five minutes of Ted Cruz when we come back with his 21-hour
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.040]  filibuster he gave today and then there's all the other news that we haven't
[49:52.040 --> 49:58.040]  gotten to we have again YouTube censoring documented facts with Dr. Jerome
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.600]  Corsi about Obama arming al Qaeda that's a fact and it being connected to those
[50:02.600 --> 50:07.680]  groups to the Nairobi attack in Kenya they are now censoring that video they
[50:07.680 --> 50:11.280]  are now blocking that video for the general public you cannot watch it on
[50:11.280 --> 50:14.960]  smartphones I checked two of them this morning and on the regular computer you
[50:14.960 --> 50:20.000]  have to agree that you're an adult to see the evil because it's a potentially
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.240]  offensive or graphic just not true and hey usually when I criticize Saudi
[50:24.240 --> 50:27.160]  Arabia funding al Qaeda they actually take the video down and then I have to
[50:27.160 --> 50:30.280]  threaten to sue YouTube people go why don't you just leave YouTube they hold
[50:30.280 --> 50:34.520]  themselves out as a commons they build themselves on the content we produce our
[50:34.520 --> 50:38.440]  goals just to reach the general public because we're on AM and FM stations and
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.800]  shortwave and XM and that's great to reach libertarian conservative listeners
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.360]  I want to be on YouTube to reach the general dumb down public that's why
[50:48.360 --> 50:52.960]  we're there that's why we have prison planet TV to feed it so they can't
[50:52.960 --> 50:57.160]  shut us down everybody should become prison planet TV members it's 595 a
[50:57.160 --> 51:01.560]  month 11 memberships you see all the stuff uncensored I'm sick of how the
[51:01.560 --> 51:05.760]  big drug companies are keeping men from fixing their ED without pills mad cook

[56:25.160 --> 56:29.080]  after 21 hours that ended just about an hour ago here it is I thank the senator
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.120]  from Idaho for his question and for his steadfast leadership and willing to
[56:33.120 --> 56:36.240]  stand up willingness to stand up and fight for the American people to stop
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.320]  this train wreck that is Obamacare and the answer to my friend's question is
[56:40.320 --> 56:44.360]  of course no small businesses all over this country are getting hammered by
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.320]  Obamacare and you know the real losers are not even the small business owners
[56:47.320 --> 56:54.440]  the real losers are the people the teenage kids who we get hired the single
[56:54.440 --> 56:57.440]  moms who would get hired the African-Americans the Hispanics were
[56:57.440 --> 57:01.120]  suddenly finding themselves either without a job or forcibly reduced to 29
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.400]  hours a week and denied the opportunity to get to that first rung of the economic
[57:06.400 --> 57:09.520]  ladder which would give them the second and the third and the fourth millions of
[57:09.520 --> 57:15.120]  Americans are hurting under Obamacare and it is my plea to this body to the
[57:15.120 --> 57:20.320]  Democrats that they listen to the unions that are asking on behalf of
[57:20.320 --> 57:27.040]  millions of Americans who are struggling to repeal Obamacare and that we
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.960]  not have a system where the rich and powerful where big corporations and
[57:31.960 --> 57:35.720]  members of Congress are treated to a different set of rules than hard-working
[57:35.720 --> 57:40.520]  Americans President Obama's granted exemptions illegally to big businesses and
[57:40.520 --> 57:44.480]  members of Congress I don't think the American people should be subject to
[57:44.480 --> 57:50.200]  harsher rules and so my plea to this body is that we listen to the American
[57:50.200 --> 57:54.520]  people because if we listen to our constituents the answer is defund this
[57:54.520 --> 57:57.760]  bill that isn't working that's hurting the American people that's killing jobs
[57:57.760 --> 58:00.920]  that's forcing people into part-time work that's driving up health insurance
[58:00.920 --> 58:05.200]  premiums and that's causing millions to lose or fear that they will lose their
[58:05.200 --> 58:12.520]  health insurance I will close as the time is wrapping up by noting when at
[58:12.520 --> 58:17.880]  noon we will have a prayer and I think it's fitting that this debate conclude
[58:17.880 --> 58:27.160]  with a prayer because I would ask that everyone in this body ask for the Lord's
[58:27.160 --> 58:31.560]  guidance amen to that on how we best listen to our constituents listen to
[58:31.560 --> 58:35.880]  the pleas for help that are coming from our constituents that's right all right
[58:35.880 --> 58:40.960]  folks second hour coming up then Harry Reid interrupted

[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:30.600]  Alex Jones people are getting really sick and tired of the unjust system where
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:36.100]  the politicians the offshore banks or tax exempt Obamacare exempt and then they
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.880]  use all these taxes and regulations to destroy us politically so we're
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.480]  dependent on them it really boils down to that Ted Cruz an hour ago concluded a
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.560]  21-hour fellow buster the establishment authoritarian media that poses as
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:52.160]  liberals are reeling and frothing anger right now they want to break this
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.800]  country they want to collect device things the Republican leadership wants
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.440]  that as well they hate Cruz and Rand Paul they hate us but it doesn't matter
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.520]  we're winning the hearts and minds the American people and of mainland
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.640]  conservatives and of the military and of liberals that are real liberals and who
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:11.760]  aren't authoritarians let's go to your phone calls and get your take on Ted
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.600]  Cruz and this historic speech he gave Sean in Wyoming thanks for calling in
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.000]  what's your take on what you just heard he was articulate composed and
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.320]  extraordinary was he not he's very presidential yes and the thing of it is
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.640]  is I watched it all night I fell asleep by the television and I woke up and it
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.280]  seems like you saw some of that too but it was extraordinary because Mike Lee
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.920]  from Utah was there as well and the heat Mike Lee went in the had a little
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.440]  dissertation in the middle of the morning which is unfortunate because most
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.200]  of Americans weren't able to see it but he talked about ultimately those that are
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:57.520]  of us to believe in the Constitution the Constitution trumps the uncut any
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:03.360]  unconstitutional ruling that may occur from time to time that's Marbury versus
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.320]  Madison absolutely absolutely and you know these guys are very well
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:15.760]  scholar on the Constitution ran Paul Lee and and Cruz and to some extent Rubio
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.920]  in Florida and you know they've come out of this this movement in 2010 when
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:27.680]  people started to get mad at the politicians that voted originally voted
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.760]  for this Obamacare and we need that to occur next year with with that much
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:39.520]  more diligence but it was extraordinary to watch I agree with you and even if
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.480]  they're unable to repeal it now it will get repealed and just because we're
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.440]  resisting we didn't even have a resistance movement five years ago the
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.480]  Republicans were trying to co-op the Tea Party they failed and and and and so
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.040]  now Harry Reid's gone from saying the Tea Party has no power to last week
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.720]  throwing fits saying the Tea Party runs things notice every time I watch Fox
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.000]  News and see Carl Rove what's he doing bad mouthing the Tea Party he tried to
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.240]  take it over and he couldn't do it we're done with blue blood Republicans we're
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.360]  done with all these these authoritarian Democrats I'm not calling them liberals
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:18.320]  anymore they are criminals and they know they're criminals I mean look the family
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.840]  business with all these people is race baiting and fighting and dependency I
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:28.400]  mean these are really disgusting people and if we just politically discredit
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.320]  them and speak out against them and stop getting intimidated by them it's over
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.840]  that's how humanity works doesn't matter how much police state how much
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.640]  garbage it's over it's Trump the Soviet Union couldn't stand East Germany
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:46.760]  couldn't stand when the people withdrew their consent and that's why people like
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:52.320]  Lou Rockwell were so freaked out by you know Lord loving me you know means well
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.200]  people like Adam Kokesh they don't want to give them an excuse to start some
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.680]  physical confrontation when we are winning that's why the look they're
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.760]  going to blow stuff up and blame it on us it's the only move they've got the
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.200]  problem is our people you think you think the federal SWAT team five years
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.080]  ago would have come out and said they were ordered to stand down you think the
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.640]  ATF would have gone public and told there was a cover-up five years ago see
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.280]  nobody's shutting up that's why they're scared of whistleblowers I bless you sir

[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.600]  filibuster shut down by the creature harry reid the most unpopular
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.040]  politician in america according to gallup and as you know between
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.520]  1917 percent depending on what group they ask in gallup but the highest is
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.720]  19 percent trust and support in government all
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.720]  time low as i've told you the last few years but
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.960]  especially the last few months a total collapse in confidence in the system
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.840]  the military anybody that's been in more than a couple years
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.480]  i'd say 90 away the young guys that get in for economic reasons or whatever
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.360]  they just want to play video games or kill people
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:08.120]  not many of them are awake but anybody who's been in anybody that's seen how
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.280]  the world works is waking up right now and for those
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.760]  that don't know when the military and the police wake up
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.160]  with a regime it's over that's why the system the globalists that have
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.680]  captured this government that occupy it and those aren't words
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.440]  the globalists write books bragging that they have captured america
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.800]  and these guys are about to get crowned king nothing because they are
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:39.000]  falling down umpty-dumpty folks is falling down
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.520]  umpty-dumpty sat on a wall umpty-dumpty had a great fall
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.960]  all the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to put the new order
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:49.640]  together again now just like hitler by the time he lost the
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.520]  battle of britain and the west started gearing up to invade the continent of
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.400]  europe he was going to lose world war two probably then
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.880]  so but he's still doubled down and invaded russia with operation barbarossa
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.240]  and the dream there was they would take over the
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.960]  arian areas as they saw it of western russia and conscript them
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.120]  and you know magic ss armies should defeat everybody and that didn't happen
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.480]  because see the russians faced a frontal assault and couldn't give up
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.720]  they had to fight for their lives and they won and it was really the russians
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.040]  folks that predominantly beat the germans
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.200]  i mean the the the western allies had a big part of that as well maybe 20 30
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.520]  percent of it but it was the russians that were in the big
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.760]  you know million man wars and hundreds of thousands dying and stalin grad you
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.760]  know leningrad just unbelievable stuff i say stalin grad leningrad they were
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.280]  changing the name all the time at st petersberg today
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.400]  this is the type of stuff that's going on historically
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.240]  and the globalists have put in their control grids their spy grids they're
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.440]  trying to acclimate everybody to illegal spying and secret
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.280]  arrest but it's not working it's just freaking everybody out
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.640]  and everybody knows their exempt from the taxes and regulations
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:03.560]  everybody knows they're doing it to shut down their competition everybody knows
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.360]  they're really slimy except for maybe 15 percent of people
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.440]  that are on welfare and work for the system even people that have government
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.040]  jobs know it's pure bull you do have some folks that
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.800]  literally think obama's their daddy like chris rock
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.920]  and uh other folks that think he's you know our lord and savior barack obama
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:28.600]  as fox said what's the name jamie fox
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.680]  it just gives me a headache to see how they're delusional it's like a guy on
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.440]  pcp jumps off a building thinking he has wings and kills himself
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.880]  that's how jamie fox and chris rock are i want them to be free
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.240]  i want them to be happy but they're just imagining their winning as there's a
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.920]  black president when it's all a corporate con game
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.360]  and and racial divisions at all time highs the black unemployment rates
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.600]  double i literally want people to be prosperous
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.480]  i literally want everybody to be successful and then
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.520]  i have to sit here and be called racist by msnbc and cnn without showing
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.640]  evidence that shows the incredible propaganda war we've entered
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.320]  where we give you facts numbers statistics and if we say obama says
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.400]  raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise debt we play the clip if we say
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.080]  ted cruise said this we play the clip if we say a bill says this
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.120]  we show you the bill if we say a poll says this we show the bill
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  not with harry reid barack obama gets up and says 90 percent of americans want
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.760]  to turn their guns in or whatever it's actually the opposite numbers
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.080]  so we're at a historical point the issue here is
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.080]  are we going to be able to turn the tide and turn this around our guest is
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:44.680]  coming up at the bottom of the gower uh dealing with veterans for peace
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.280]  from the left angle trying to impeach obama and why is the president of
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.640]  veterans for peace not moving to impeach obama when he moved impeach a
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.080]  bush well because he's a peace prize winner obviously
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.800]  i'll tell you hitler should have got a peace prize folks we'd be speaking
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.720]  german right now and if he wore a pink uniform
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:05.160]  he'd have been over and had a feng shui person over
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.280]  and like set up the right chancellery with under feng shui
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.520]  and in feng shui were that thing where you arrange that house according to some
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.040]  i'm making sure i'm getting it right there according to
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.720]  the easter bunny the pointer santa claus or whatever it is
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.560]  this is the type of stuff we're dealing with here and we've got a lot of other
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.360]  serious news i'm going to get to as well after we take calls
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.960]  senator warns obama not to implement un arms treaty
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.560]  that's up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com

[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.480]  newly freed black slaves did not use guns that's on record by the way
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.440]  as well as train northerners how to shoot in general
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:00.040]  it doesn't matter they have they have
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.520]  the black caucus and others saying it's racist as blacks are getting killed the
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.080]  gang culture is why people are killing each other
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:11.080]  not the gun let's continue here carry to sign
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.720]  un arms treaty despite senators warning that's an article out of fox news
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:20.040]  mirroring info wars dot com meanwhile hollywood's new favorite cars are armored
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.560]  and electrified they've got armed guards but you can't have that
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.800]  you can't be your own arm guard you know it's a really
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.440]  good feeling that we've got about five people that work here with concealed
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.960]  carries and i got a 357 right here and an
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.560]  m4 back in my office and i'm just gonna defend myself

[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.160]  and and they hate that the idea that oh government's got guns in every room to
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.360]  protect themselves but i shouldn't have guns to protect myself
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.040]  it's just like i've got a screwdriver over there if i need it to it's a tool
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:59.240]  something it's a mythical uh you know spear of destiny that we have or
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.320]  something it's that we don't live in fear and we call 911 after we defend
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:06.520]  ourselves that's what it's all about ladies and
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:09.960]  gentlemen not like getting in a fetal position if somebody came here after
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.800]  us i guess we're all just supposed to get in a fetal
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.600]  position notice the mass shooters always go to where they know there's no
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.080]  guns
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:21.720]  that's the government training video say that that if someone's trying to rape
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.480]  you you vomit urinate or poop on them imagine i have two daughters and imagine
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.840]  only uh we've got them in mixed martial arts we're
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.200]  teaching them how to shoot i can't imagine telling my daughters well if
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.000]  a guy ever tries to rape you you know when you move out of home when you're
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.840]  18 or whatever i want you to vomit on them or pee on
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.320]  them i mean it just it just shows the total
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.760]  now there's the CNN headline beyond vomiting how to prevent rape
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.360]  oh this country is so screwed up you gotta understand that
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:58.040]  the liberal followers are following an authoritarian religion
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.400]  but they themselves are literally screwed up people
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.560]  who are into being disempowered and into hating masculinity
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.560]  femininity the family and that's why their religion is screwing everything up
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.800]  because they hate everyone so that's some of the news on that front let's go to
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.600]  your phone calls what did you think of Ted Cruz and his
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.520]  historic 21 hour speech i just love it loved
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.160]  Rand Paul's filibuster but it wasn't as long this is what i want to see more of
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.120]  and notice they said oh he'll be discredited oh he's going to be demonized
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.800]  his approval polls are up
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:36.280]  it's a oh don't filibuster don't stand against us that's unpopular
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.560]  talk with a lisping npr voice you'll be successful
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.240]  they tell you to do what they know won't defeat them
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.040]  i mean if they are wild crazy gibbering authoritarians
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.400]  that write books about putting fluoride in the water to sterilize us and hurt us
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.400]  like john p. Holdren did then call them degenerate eugenicist
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.320]  ultra hitlerian control freaks don't don't don't
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.240]  just because they're extreme don't dial back what you're going to say
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:12.440]  because if it's sensational what they're doing then it's sensational
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.600]  and realize how sensational liberty is and how effective you are
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.160]  and how much power you have so many activists always dream of master
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.800]  plans to free the world and wake everybody up with a
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:27.320]  master stroke so many people write me letters or on the street if you just do
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.200]  this you just say okay you need to do it you need to
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.640]  and it will be bigger if you do it no it won't you don't know that
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.440]  it'll be bigger if all of us do little things every day
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:41.720]  go get a projector and project the first amendment up on a city wall at night
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.640]  the cops will probably come and arrest you then it'll be national news
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.320]  then the the charges will get dropped you see what i'm saying
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.080]  they kept attacking uh red light cameras all over
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.360]  arizona for about five years libertarians that are not know who was
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.560]  involved somebody was physically attacking them i i don't
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.520]  know who did that but other people just stand up there and point out it was
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.120]  happening until everybody started getting aware of it they had to remove
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.280]  them because of the moral authority now in
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.640]  florida you protest the cameras they arrest you well then you sue them
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.520]  you're going to have to fight folks and teach these servants they work for you
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.400]  teach the tyrants that you're not going to roll over that you're not easy pray
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:29.160]  i'm telling you the american symbol is not an ostrich grabbing its ankles folks
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.000]  i'm telling you you know the new symbol of america is not
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  a family bent over a car with with the state police doing proctology exams on
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.120]  them for their safety the state police know full well the
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.160]  government ships and the drugs and launders the money they know they know

[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.160]  david arizona your take on ted cruise and uh what happened
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.440]  on the that historic uh filibuster what did you think of it
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.240]  uh i i thought it was great it takes a lot of physical strength and stamina
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:40.840]  to stand for 21 hours and speak well bigger than standing as the talking
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:44.840]  yeah exactly yeah and i've i've seen soldiers in the
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.520]  military pass out just standing in formation in the sun for me for maybe
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:52.200]  an hour you know and i've been close to that too
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.760]  but i i do want to say that i'm also thankful that he ended in prayer
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.640]  and asking for wisdom oh yeah oh yeah putin got criticized for putting an
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.480]  editorial out last week calling for loving jesus
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.240]  that day what a dirty rat they said families are important man
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.320]  he needs to be fired like that fox fox sports reporter go ahead
[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:19.000]  well uh back to our forefathers now uh who uh uh ted cruise is representing and
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.800]  he's representing us you and i uh the very first amendment the first
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.760]  part of the first amendment they had the foresight the wisdom to put in
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:33.240]  congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.760]  but they've already done that with our public schools they're the synagogue of
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.400]  faith and they teach the opposite of the 10 commandments in the public schools
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.160]  and they teach that man came from primordial ooze
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.880]  4.5 billion years ago which is a religion so they are violating the first
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.760]  amendment rights of your children you should not even be sending your
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:56.200]  children to a public school well you know i don't get into debates
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:59.240]  about how god made the universe but undoubtedly the whole
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.920]  their theory of evolution has been proven a fraud darwin was one of the
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.480]  fathers of eugenics he claimed that he was demon
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.760]  possessed for three days with a fever when he got the idea of uh evolution i'm
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.240]  not kidding folks look this up this is a fact
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.280]  uh read the origin of the species i've actually scanned over i hadn't read the
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.600]  whole thing years ago but i've scanned over it
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:24.440]  and it's it things do change cars evolve computers evolve
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.960]  uh i mean by evolve you know you can breed
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.760]  you know big strong men with big strong women and get bigger stronger people
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.680]  i mean there is breeding there are changes out there and and the devil's
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.960]  very smart they got the church's last 170 years
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.560]  to debate science like the bible was unscientific
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.760]  and then had preachers that weren't scientists debate other scientists who
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:50.520]  themselves had their own religion and so it became all about fighting
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.960]  and discrediting the bible by men projecting their ideas on to it
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.160]  to create a false debate and it was pure genius and i don't debate any of it
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.400]  you know the bible is is is accurate about the heaven so was the korean by the
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.440]  way and so uh are uh uh you know famous jewish historical
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.400]  writings it's it's it was people the last thousand
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.800]  years you know leading up to the renaissance who thought the world was
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:19.720]  flattened all that so that was the dark ages folks
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.600]  and uh the point is is that there is a force of evil and good in the universe
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.800]  and there's a lot of you know there's 10 000 churches
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:33.800]  and there's 10 000 times 10 000 that's because everybody can fight on dogma
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.840]  to then break off and create their own group
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:42.600]  and then you end up with you know the 100 different brands of each group out
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:46.600]  there with everybody being Pharisees saying everybody else is the devil
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.960]  i just want to have a good heart and try to be a good person
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:53.800]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:58.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:04.840]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:08.760]  moved through history every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:14.200]  of information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:20.360]  looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.160]  hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.160]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.920]  between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take total
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.800]  control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast

[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.640]  robots are 15 million robots that have been ordered to china five million of
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.000]  them by foxconn to make the apple iPhones
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.600]  yeah bad news you might not be getting that one you've got the new apple
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:01.320]  iPhones you've got pre-ordered sorry they're committing suicide too fast and
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.600]  having forced abortions right now at the giant death
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.200]  facilities and of course i've got an iphone
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.480]  and i admit it's a tracker system to enslave me
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.600]  and that it spies on everything i do and intel's coming out with their new
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:16.920]  chips for phones that are on all the time
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.440]  and are actually powered by wireless integrated with much whole story
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.800]  steve watson's working on i mean i know this is a little
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:28.520]  imperial probe droid that that that is designed it's not that the technology
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:32.200]  isn't interesting and isn't useful it's that we're not given this and allowed
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.680]  to buy this because the system loves us
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.960]  it's because this is the trojan horse of transhumanism this is the eugenics god
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.440]  this is our little guardian our little watcher that lovingly kills us every
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.080]  day while we use it with the microwave radiation on record
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:57.160]  and it was built in a giant death camp with mass suicide suicide nets forced
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.160]  abortions the the drugging them with anti psychotics
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.200]  18 hours a day people sleeping outside their children
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.200]  chained to poles the most vicious factories in the world build iPhones
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:14.360]  because the liberals demand more war and more death than anyone else because
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.480]  they're not liberals they are authoritarians
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.920]  they they disgrace the name liberal that thomas jefferson was
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.320]  you don't understand what monsters they are and you say well then you should
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:29.240]  vote with your dollars and not use this hey the others are the same as well
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.960]  they all run the gamut but this is the rock bottom worst is the
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:39.400]  apple products and and and i point out
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.680]  what the system is and have it here as an example to show you
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:48.200]  you understand it's like someone who's had an abortion
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.160]  coming out and telling you it's a bad idea we're not judging anybody that has
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.880]  these but people think it's a status symbol it's
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.640]  shameful to have an iphone
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.440]  very very shameful if you don't have it as a demonstration piece to show people
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.600]  this was built by slaves political slaves
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:12.920]  that don't have a choice and if you just paid five dollars more for these so
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:15.720]  they're trying to lower the price so more poor people can get it
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.680]  so they can deindustrialize further you understand and track you
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.640]  if you just paid five dollars more they've got studies out you can lift
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:25.240]  those people and shine out of poverty but there'll be no fair trade for iphone
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:29.560]  this is designed to destroy people they want to kill people in the process of
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.360]  making these that that's because humans are bad
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.880]  they're the enlightened globalists getting rid of the unwashed masses
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:41.160]  they're saving the earth while they use up the humans in the forced labor camps

[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.840]  starts with a single step look at this graph i've got
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.360]  food stamp growth 75 times greater than job creation
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.600]  and that's with government cooked numbers weekly standards got that the

[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.720]  folks this 14.7 million more people on
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:25.720]  food stamps compared to 194,000 new jobs created and
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.840]  by the way most of those are jobs created as everybody's going to part time
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.440]  tens of millions you're being told oh sorry no more 40 hours you're down to
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.880]  25 or a lot of companies are just closing
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.120]  their doors they're just saying you know what i'm done
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.040]  in fact most business people i talk to they're over 50 they go man i really
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.160]  had a passion don't want to let my employees go but i'm just sick of it
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.960]  i'm leaving america and i'm shutting down and they go and they say bye
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.080]  everybody i mean this is what happens in third
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.480]  world communist countries we're now going into it
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.400]  opium and the bankers know this the corporations are all exempt from this
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.560]  they're going to roll in and take over the economy
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.720]  they they they know human nature that's why people need to stay and work and
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.000]  keep people hired and do whatever you got to do
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.320]  to not comply in my view because you know the bankers are criminals
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.920]  so at this point it is a crime to comply we comply
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:18.120]  because we're right in the middle of the crosshairs and that's not our battle
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:23.960]  but i personally i personally myself i'm not complying at grocery stores i'm
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.760]  personally sticking bumper stickers up on public things now
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.280]  i'm personally walking up to cops i see and preaching anything i'm personally
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.440]  getting really aggressive okay i mean i'm doing it i am but i cannot help it
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:39.160]  now we've gotten in this position because we see like-minded americans and we
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.480]  talk to them at average folks we don't talk to them
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.360]  i'm jogging through a neighborhood i'll stop and go hey you you know about

[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:53.640]  nationally um mike finner has intervened for two years to
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:56.360]  keep veterans for peace national president elliot
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:00.200]  adam's from sitting the same letter the members of congress call calling for a
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.240]  resolution impeach obama so it's not enough to just have all the hollywood
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.360]  people and folks you know go okay obama condos
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.920]  he's worse than bush with the press worse than bush on so many issues
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:16.040]  because he's more effective at evil and so we must politically destroy him
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.880]  even though he's a puppet to stop the agenda to stop the wars to stop the
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.720]  serious starting that war uh escalating that war and so i want to
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.240]  commend phil rostino i know he's really active because i see his work all the
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.200]  time out of all the veterans for peace people he's very
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:32.920]  effective let's say a few words first about bob bowman
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.000]  and then i want to get into we have a clip of this uh of the president of your
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.360]  group calling to go after bush but but but not obama
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:45.000]  uh you guys were an important influential group with what you'd call the left
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  i would just call it the the the real left not the authoritarian left
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.360]  and trying to get an impeachment resolution going
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.720]  uh you know why is it all the libertarians doing that not the republican
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:59.400]  leadership or democratic leadership it shows how paid off they are
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:04.360]  but phil good to have you on joining us via skype oh thank you alex uh thank you
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.400]  for the opportunity to get our story out today
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.880]  and i've got so much to tell you i can hardly wait to hear what it is
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.120]  but uh you mentioned bob bowman and and if i could
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:19.800]  whatever good comes from this interview we'd like to dedicate it
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:26.040]  to dr bob bowman and there's a couple of things i do have to clear up uh any
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.640]  criticism that i do have of veterans for peace
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:33.400]  and uh the anti-war organizations as a whole
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:38.280]  is because i believe in the veterans for peace statement of purpose
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.560]  i believe in what they uh practiced the principles they practiced uh during the
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.960]  bush years which got me to join them and as far as the
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.680]  president of veterans for peace you mentioned mike fernar he's a former
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:56.840]  president of veterans for peace but he's the fellow that gave that fiery
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:03.000]  speech in 2005 which led me to to join veterans for peace
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.280]  and we did eventually pass a resolution in 2011 uh at the national level calling
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.800]  for congress to impeach obama for the same war crimes we cited in our call
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.560]  for impeaching bush and at that particular time
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.760]  there was a the president was elliot adams
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:26.200]  uh in 2011 and now yeah i don't know all that
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.800]  inside baseball i'm just going off your letter you sent us or so so so bottom
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.920]  line what how do we get veterans for peace to take action
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:38.360]  well right now uh we have this article out on activist post and i appreciate
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.200]  you folks taking note of it it's called timeline
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:48.760]  to veterans for peace is vote to impeach obama 2009 to 2013 and if we could
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:53.640]  direct your audience to that article on activistpost.com
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.840]  all the links and the whole story is there okay but
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:03.080]  but um what we have is a resolution right now two years later which if it
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.120]  passes uh next month when the membership votes it will force
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.000]  the president the current president patrick mccann of veterans for peace to
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.880]  issue the same letter and and deliver it to members of congress as
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:22.520]  was done in 2005 uh for bush uh that has not been
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:26.760]  done for two years now since the resolution impeach obama passed into
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.160]  11
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:33.960]  well uh again i just think it's disgusting that he's been given the
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:37.320]  peace prize in that uh all the so-called lefties are really a bunch of
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:41.000]  authoritarians um the national stage dancing around going
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.920]  nae nae boo boo our guy won i was there criticizing bush for all
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:48.600]  his warmongering it's just disgusting i can't see how all the so-called
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:52.120]  anti-war left when we've got the government starting wars
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.880]  openly now and overthrowing all these countries and and just
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:58.840]  engaging in mass murder of christians you name it
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:02.280]  and i don't hear anything out of the anti-war movement
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.000]  because it's just too trendy uh to love barack obama
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.040]  well it it's it's been a shame and this is why we've been uh there's there's a
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:16.680]  lot of us in the rank and file alex that are never heard from
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.480]  and that's why uh we're criticizing the national leadership because that's
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:25.960]  what uh the impression them general public gets is from them
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.360]  unless you're active locally and that's what your local community gets
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:36.840]  but uh our chapter of veterans for peace i don't think you could call us left
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.600]  or right we just stick to the statement of purpose
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.040]  and we had a good example in uh bob bowman being a
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:48.920]  a member of our chapter uh as you know bob bowman during the last years of his
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:53.560]  life was very strong on the art of getting out the word about the
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:57.560]  artificial divide of americans between left and right
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:03.160]  there's a great in studio interview you did with him back in july of 2009 which
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:09.320]  we made into a dvd and his article of july 2010 called
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.800]  left and right together uh your interview with him back then
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:19.080]  is entitled uh america is artificially divided
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.800]  and and that's what we have here and i believe that that is the biggest threat
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.720]  to our security in this country is this divide
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.880]  and uh i agree with you and it's because of that a false left right
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.520]  paradigm it doesn't mean that on the so-called left and right there aren't
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.680]  real issue differences but the system uses those terms
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.960]  just to get people not to work together exactly and again the so-called left
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:49.560]  where are they criticizing obama on the ndaa on persecution of the press
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.880]  on all of it all americans need to come together against this
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.880]  and obama needs to be impeached impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.960]  just as deniz kasinich you know has now been critical of obama he got that
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.960]  air force one flight early on and yes suddenly supported obama
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:10.280]  i don't give a people sell out for red carpets and you know sell out for feeling
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.280]  like they're part of the power structure i mean
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:15.320]  i wouldn't want to be on air force one i wouldn't want to walk around on red
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:19.400]  carpets it's embarrassing it's pathetic it's all delusional
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:24.440]  garbage and it'll all end up being dust speaking to bob uh when was the last
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.600]  time you had a chance to talk to him before he died
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.520]  uh just about a week or so we we took him to the va
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:36.200]  uh down there in and virile beach and uh it was a very good funeral service we
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.400]  had for him and and um uh i could go on for hours about bob
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.960]  bowman um but one thing you mentioned uh and his wife
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:49.720]  maggie i spoke with her sunday and and she's looking forward to
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.600]  getting together with you at some point uh uh with family friend russell
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.880]  gentili um yeah we've invited her on the show
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:01.400]  yes she's family reached out and whoever his daughter whoever would like to get
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:04.360]  him on yeah it's tough she just lost bob and no
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:09.160]  yeah it's a it's a process but she does want to take you up on that invitation
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:15.720]  um but as far as uh the left and the right uh it's it's really the problem
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:23.320]  here and you mentioned uh denis kucinich uh when obama bombed libya
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:29.080]  in 2011 march 19th you had uh professor francis boil
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:33.240]  who would be viewed as someone from the left international law professor who
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:36.440]  was actually prosecuted war criminals here
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:40.040]  and and former uh deputy attorney general bruce
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.120]  fine which would be considered the right and then you had pundits left and
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.200]  right you had members of congress left and right all calling for impeaching
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.480]  obama for for attacking libya yet the
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.120]  leadership of the anti-war movement was mute
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:57.480]  that's right because they're really controlled opposition cfl veterans for

[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.760]  doesn't have outrageous claims but is really effective
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:38.600]  in hardcore i always know but i also learned one time we showed a clip of
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:41.560]  the skexies dying in the dark crystal uh when the
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:45.800]  saudi king had died and we made a joke out of it and they took it down you
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:48.840]  too put a strike on us and said that was offensive
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:51.880]  to show a clip of a disney movie of a dying emperor
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:55.080]  and if you can't lampoon public figures who can you and it's because these
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.320]  people throw their money around and they want to make america authoritarian
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:02.040]  that you got all these lobbying interests that make their money out of
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:05.240]  criminal government who are here lobbying to take our freedom and the
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.240]  saudi arabians are right in the middle of it and i'm sick of it
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.760]  i am sick and tired of it
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:17.400]  so there's gonna be a lot more talking about the saudi royal family and a
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:20.920]  lot more coverage here because you start trying to push us around you're
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:25.080]  gonna you're gonna get a doubling down punks
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:29.560]  chad in kentucky you're on the air go ahead welcome
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.080]  thank you yeah i just want to say you know when when obama goes to bed at
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:36.520]  night and you know all our ambassadors get killed over in benghazi and you've
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:39.960]  got ted cruise that stands up there and we'll you know preach about the
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.480]  constitution is actually talking about this tabernacle government
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:47.400]  he's talking about you know all sorts of other things that are going on
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.360]  you know everyone's starting to wake up and these politicians know that and
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:53.080]  that's why they're kind of going on both sides right now and
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:57.160]  it's either on your side of liberty or the you know the side of tyranny
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:00.200]  i mean patreus can't even go out in public you know mccain can't even go
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:03.640]  out in public anymore and you've talked about this before
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:07.240]  well that's right and the neocons and the democrats are all in this together at
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:11.400]  the top it's liberty versus tyranny it's libertarian versus
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.240]  authoritarian it that's the choice that we all
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.160]  have right now and the system's gone from all the tea party to have any power
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:23.240]  to they're running things too uh everybody loves obama cared like all
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.720]  right we know you don't like it but it doesn't matter
[01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.240]  because they don't now they know that they're in trouble
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:32.840]  and i'm just concerned about what they're going to pull to change the subject
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:36.040]  and i i predict bigger mass shootings are going to stage
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:39.240]  and new oklahoma city bombings they're going to blame on us
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:42.040]  and they've already done it a bunch to me they blamed the boston bombing on me
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:46.440]  because i pointed out they were behind it they now say on singing in an msnbc
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:51.560]  that that i made them bomb with no proof now now why do you think they'll come
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.560]  out and say things like that that alex jones and libertarians are why the
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.040]  zharnev brothers bombed why do you think they say that with no
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:03.640]  proof because we are the high noon to these vampires
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:07.400]  do you see what i'm saying chad oh yeah i definitely agree
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:10.360]  um i think that they're you know they know that they either have to hurry up
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:13.160]  and close the door on us because so many people are waking up
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:16.200]  or we're going to wake up and put them all in jail
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:19.640]  and now with this un arms treaty that carries about the sign today

[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:06.600]  alex pleasure to talk to you um it's a breath of fresh air to finally see uh
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:11.960]  politicians who actually stand and could you imagine obama standing for 21
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.840]  hours i could imagine him partying at a jz thing
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.000]  it's snort and cocaine and uh you know smoking packs of cigarettes or i could
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.960]  imagine hillary had a 21-hour lesbian orgy but uh i can't when that's all
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:27.080]  public now we always knew it i can imagine bill clinton biting and
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.920]  raping women for 24 hours that's what he does is bite bite them
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.520]  uh he holds them down while he bites them and rapes them he settled in court on
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.920]  that so yeah i can imagine i'm actually raping
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.800]  women for 24 hours but i can't or snort and cocaine
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:43.480]  but i can't imagine an eloquently speaking on liberty as a statesman
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:49.320]  um what do you ask it's it's just a complete breath of fresh air i did not
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:53.080]  think that there was anybody left in the republican party that would uh
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:58.040]  that would stand on their principles they usually bend and flutter and the wind
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:02.120]  as soon as they get up to washington it's it's really good hopefully
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:06.120]  um we can keep supporting them and keep our eye on them
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:10.120]  and keep pressuring them and and and get and get them to keep going in the same
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:13.720]  well that's right rand paul is able to do this because he has massive support so
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:16.760]  is ted cruz and they're now the example for a whole new
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:20.520]  generation and and by the way at internal democratic party fundraisers
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:25.080]  with obama and reid and uh the vice president biden
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:29.640]  jiv aiden as they call me mr shotgun they're panicking and stuff that they
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:32.360]  don't want to get out going we're in trouble the tea party's the enemy
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.680]  that's why they're on the news going racist killers jones is a bomber

[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:19.400]  and maybe one out of let's not it's got to be
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:24.600]  500 videos get censored by youtube and youtube's a large part of our outreach
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:27.240]  we've reached conservatively with our channels
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.760]  500 million people just with our channels we got 330 something million on
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:33.800]  one channel we have films that get seen 20 30 40
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:38.040]  million times on other folks's channels so it's an important outreach to people
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:42.200]  that don't listen to talk radio and every time i talk about
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.840]  saudi arabia funding terrorism which is on record
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:48.680]  every time i talk about obama connected to funding terrorism we're seeing
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.360]  censorship they have blocked the video on my smartphone and
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:56.360]  other smartphones and on regular computers it says breaking
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:00.280]  obama linked to kenyan mall massacre revealed and we show all the links in
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:04.600]  the history and odinga and uh being with the radical muslims and
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.160]  and obama funding the muslim brotherhood out of kenya
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:10.360]  that you wrote about a month ago and it's in the egyptian press
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:13.160]  so i want to give you the floor for the eight minutes i'm not going to interrupt

[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:27.480]  this type of censorship we're seeing and any new developments that are
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:30.440]  unfolding then we'll go to break then we're going to come back
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.240]  and we're going to uh go uh into some of the other things that are happening
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:39.960]  political but dr course you go ahead well the the main links here are that
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:44.200]  uh kenya of course which is when obama claims this is
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:50.920]  you know the country of his father obama going back to odinga who is the
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:55.400]  luo tribe member as obama's family was luo tribe
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:01.880]  in the run up to the election in 2007 obama and odinga were close obama was
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.840]  in kenya in 2006 before he ran for election and
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:10.680]  made contact with odinga odinga signed an agreement
[02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:15.000]  uh with first a secret agreement that was brought forward to the public
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.440]  in kenya with radical islamists in kenya saying that if they would support
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:28.040]  odinga he would sway the government to accommodate
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.840]  islamist interests and would work with this new constitution
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:37.880]  to put increasingly kenya under sharia law well the
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:41.720]  odinga did not win the election and as part of the plan
[02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:47.720]  have been discussed with obama and i documented that back in 2004
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:55.720]  to go forward 2008 election that um obama and odinga
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:59.560]  were going to have this violence which odinga had the luo tribe members
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:05.480]  rose up against the kikuyu people were killed uh christians were burned in
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:10.520]  churches in kenya uh obama did not condemn the
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:18.200]  violence he used the violence to um advance the career of odinga kofi and
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:23.000]  it entered odinga became co-head of state with president kibaki he became
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.240]  prime minister and then the rolling forward
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:31.160]  when obama is president we're putting all kinds of foreign aid into kenya we are
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:37.880]  actually using us public money taxpayer money to fund the constitution passing
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:45.640]  this new constitution pressed by odinga which opens up again uh the uh
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:52.360]  kenya to sharia law which invites in various islamic factions islamic
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:56.840]  factions are coming in from somalia these are welcomed in by
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:02.200]  odinga and the uh is in the radical islamic presence in kenya begins to
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:06.200]  build at the same time malik obama who is the
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.400]  brother the half brother of brock obama in kenya
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:16.360]  emerges and that he is managing money for the egyptian brotherhood
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:21.480]  in for the muslim brotherhood in egypt and the egyptian government comes out
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:25.080]  and they say they're going to prosecute there have been criminal charges filed
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:29.160]  against malik for running terrorist money now
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.880]  the muslim brotherhood is actually illegal condemned within egypt
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:37.080]  there's a number of muslim brotherhood members on
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:42.200]  uh in prison going to a weight trial the government and this new government the
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.160]  military government has announced that they will
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:50.360]  reveal the links of obama president in the white house
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:54.840]  supporting through his brother malik the muslim brotherhood interests and
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.880]  radical islam throughout egypt throughout north africa and into
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:07.080]  kenya malik also manages the islamic dowel fund which is a north
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:12.280]  sudenese fund another terrorist fund for the for the president of that
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:18.040]  country bashar who is under a criminal indictment by the international
[02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:23.480]  criminal court the hay for genocide and and malik obama has these deep ties
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.480]  he's running a fraudulent 501c3 in the united
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:30.600]  states named after his brother the brock h obama
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:36.680]  foundation that uh lois lerter gave retroactive determination letter so
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:41.400]  that it was a tax free organization tax exempt
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.160]  organization and now obama and now obama has signed
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:48.200]  orders two weeks to go to openly armed terrorist
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:52.600]  he's so evil and so gangster and so corrupt and getting away with everything
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:56.680]  i can't even believe it's gotten this wild and then he actually
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:00.680]  for all intents and purposes obama is the head of al-qaeda worldwide
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:04.360]  well i've said that i've said basically we are al-qaeda
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:10.040]  people gotta say we've become al-qaeda the united states has been funding al-qaeda
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:13.640]  certainly since before qaddafi fell
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:18.120]  what we were doing with ben gazi because remember ambassador stevens came into
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:22.360]  libya through ben gazi before we had diplomatic relations
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:27.720]  with libya and what he was doing was working with the al-qaeda factions
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:31.240]  radical islamic factions the obama administration was
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.680]  arming these factions we're producing weapons
[02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:39.080]  so they could oppose and depose uh qaddafi
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:46.520]  once qaddafi was deposed and the radical al-qaeda forces took over libya
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:50.200]  and now ambassador stevens is ambassador
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:54.040]  he's again in ben gazi and we're running guns now
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:17:00.920]  from libya to al-qaeda and the jihadis and sending terrorists from libya
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:08.040]  via turkey and arms into syria where we're backing the al-qaeda forces
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:12.520]  again just as we backed the muslim brotherhood forces
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:17.160]  throughout northeastern africa and again these are all radical jihadist
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:21.000]  factors the muslim brotherhood is now outlawed as a criminal
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.200]  terrorist organization in egypt and president obama was solidly behind the
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:31.880]  muslim brotherhood in egypt that's the story it's all true
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:35.800]  and when you say we're behind al-qaeda obviously criminal elements in the
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:39.560]  government centered around obama and it goes back before that but
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:45.240]  why would they calculate to stir up a sunni-shiite civil war across the
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.280]  middle east offensively with the west committing
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:51.720]  war crimes arming al-qaeda to start the fight under
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:58.360]  common law and international law that is uh by war crime and how do they think
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:02.280]  they're going to get away with this and now you have spectacles like the head
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.920]  of al-nuzra who's also the head of al-qaeda coming out two weeks ago and
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:09.720]  saying attack soft targets and now they're doing it
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:13.240]  and then obama's half brother is involved funding these groups
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:17.880]  and it's public i mean i just can't believe how naked they are that they're
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.320]  not even trying to hide it i mean reagan arming
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:25.400]  the contras was was nothing compared to this i mean
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:29.080]  how do they why are they so arrogant well because again
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:33.880]  follow the money the interests being served here are saudi arabia
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:38.520]  and obama's serving saudi arabia's interest lying to the american public
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:42.120]  another cia said allies look who's in charge of the
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:45.880]  cia a john brennan john brennan's
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:50.040]  intelligence firm before obama was president
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:55.480]  sanitized obama's passport records the two employees for brennan who did it
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:00.520]  were not reprimanded fired their names weren't even released
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:04.040]  and then brennan emerges as national security advisor in the white house and
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:08.520]  now he's elevated to head of the cia the only benefit here
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:16.840]  is that saudi arabia wants to destabilize the middle east in favor of
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:24.200]  sunni groups sunni radical groups that can oppose the shiites in iran
[02:19:24.200 --> 02:19:30.760]  and any forces tied to the shiites like asad in siria
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:34.760]  and the reason for this is oil it's money and oil
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.800]  saudi arabia wants to keep the price of oil high
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:40.680]  they don't want any competition they want the united states serving their
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:43.720]  oil interests that's right dr course he said they're going to come back i want
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:49.160]  to segue with you into domestic politics obama is clearly crashing and
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:52.680]  burning he's sinking right now the american people are turning on the
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:56.360]  whole system what will they pull to try to get out of this
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:59.080]  because i can just feel the false flag coming

[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:25.480]  attempted to censor me over and over again
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:29.560]  when i criticized shoddy arabia and i guess that's because they're
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.720]  on record being very authoritarian buying up a lot of u.s companies and media
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.640]  including a large position in news corps hollywood you name it
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:41.480]  and that there's a lot of other power groups as well but shoddy arabia
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:44.440]  i would love to turn america into a police state
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:48.360]  that is their their ruling power structure and dr corcy
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:52.280]  again they're censoring our interview i'd like to send that to you perhaps you
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:56.920]  can do a blurb on it because you so eloquently in 20 minutes
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:00.680]  in those two segments laid it all out and and what you're saying on air
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:04.600]  really scares them i've never seen trolls come out
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:08.360]  online and attack the video like this all over the place
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:12.040]  um in fact people threatening to kill me in mass
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.640]  emails phone calls and on youtube um and it's broken english too i guess they
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:20.600]  have brigades like many other countries do of kind of their
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:24.280]  citizen little princelings there's tens of thousands of them in their minions
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:27.880]  i guess they're harems of kidnapped women from the west or whatever
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:32.360]  attacking me right now in broken english uh it's pretty disgusting
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:36.120]  what else should i expect for daring to talk about about shoddy arabia
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:40.520]  well i mean all kinds of investigations of one kind or another that's possible
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:46.120]  uh any kind of um surveillance that could be done they'll do a whole variety of
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.240]  things i mean uh i'm sure all the taxes have been
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:53.000]  looked at for sure they've probably had all kinds of audits
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:59.320]  but you know the the control over um the investments it's always important to
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.760]  look at the money and if you want to take a
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:07.160]  fundamental look at our middle eastern strategy and especially the obama
[02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:10.840]  administration with regards to terrorism is dictated out of
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:16.760]  Saudi Arabia that the whole destabilization we had
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:22.280]  very stable regimes with mubarak we had stable regimes with qaddafi
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:25.960]  they may not have been you know the best in terms of
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:29.960]  human rights but they're very little of that region that is the best in all
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:33.240]  all the churches weren't being blown up and christians weren't being crucified
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:37.400]  down the road and uh the destabilization was in favor
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:43.400]  began with the arab spring and this arab spring was really a rise of radical
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:47.080]  Islam and anyone who understood it understood that
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:51.640]  this was not a democratic movement and google's on record four years ago helping
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.320]  coordinate it for them well and google and you know
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:59.080]  twitter is also another all these organizations twitter has also got
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:05.320]  Saudi arabian investment in it the um the idea of the middle east
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:10.440]  being destabilized was that the Saudis through the jihadist
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:13.960]  remember Wahhabism comes out of Saudi Arabia it's one of the
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:17.400]  most radical forms of Islam in the middle east
[02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:22.520]  but it's all Sunni what they want is to reestablish a caliphate
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:26.040]  you know caliphate would be like the Ottoman empire reestablished under
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:32.840]  turkey uh and the way to get there uh the jihadist thing
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:38.200]  is to destabilize the middle east with the muslim brotherhood with al-qaeda
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:44.680]  working in concert with terrorist acts to gain to destabilize
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:49.480]  create fear gain power like in Egypt the original
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:53.320]  attempt in Egypt with morsi was once morsi was elected
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:56.520]  the muslim brotherhood won the parliamentary election
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:00.360]  parliamentary seats then give them power the next step is to cancel the next
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:04.120]  election and declare the muslim brotherhood in power
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:08.360]  these techniques are used i mean they got to go back to the muslim brotherhood's
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:11.880]  roots the mufti of Jerusalem the roots with
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:16.760]  Hitler the whole idea of the you know radical control of the
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:18.120]  middle east
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.840]  well british intelligence how do they play in because
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:24.120]  they helped set up Saudi Arabia with laurence of arabia
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:28.280]  but now even england from your sources why did england
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:32.200]  who's usually going for all this why did they say let's not do it and
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:35.800]  even if there's another chemical attack that was obviously saying don't stage
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:37.880]  another one we're still not going to go in
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:40.840]  what happened in england to get them to stop what they were doing
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:43.720]  there was no necessity for england to be involved
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:46.520]  england could sit it out england doesn't have you know england's got an
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:50.600]  increasingly socialized population on the left
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:55.640]  there's a large arabic population increasingly so in London
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:59.560]  and so the you know there's no reason to destabilize
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:02.680]  great britain at this time the united states handled
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:06.280]  the destabilization of the middle east and it was all
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:13.400]  moving in favor of greater control for the sunis sure over all these radical
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:16.360]  lines why do the french suddenly want to be involved
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.400]  well the french have a deep interest in molly look at how much of the french
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:24.040]  oil is again yet coming out of africa you know again you've got to go to the
[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:27.880]  oil politics if you really want to understand the middle east and north
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.000]  exactly so they're planning to invade all of africa with their new
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:34.520]  al-qaeda secret armies and their promised goodies
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:37.720]  and to be part of the new al-qaeda caliphate if they play ball
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:42.120]  ultimately and qaddafi wanted this qaddafi was moving to
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:48.600]  create mosques all through africa the the move to create a african union which
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:51.480]  could stay there stay there tell us on the other side doctor

[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.680]  not just on iran contra when he got called up before that from the church
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:48.600]  hearings he still works as a contractor for the CIA yesterday he was in an
[02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:52.040]  air force base with a line of C-130s loading them
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:55.400]  up with weapons and obviously classified mission
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:34:00.600]  but he's been over there and he talked to a high-level NATO official
[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:04.280]  and they broke down that no indeed the ambassador and others exactly what i was

[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:46.520]  he was not admitting that basically elements of our government the mexican
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:49.240]  government are the ones really running it and there's a war with the
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:52.600]  white hats in our government and the mexican navy are the good guys
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:57.400]  which is my intel from dga sources as well so i mean this is just a mess ladies
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:02.680]  and gentlemen and he confirmed and that video is up on info wars dot com it's
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:05.320]  going to be an article that we're going to tweet out at real alex
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:08.920]  jones at the end of the hour after dr course he leaves us and we take some
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:14.360]  calls that he talked to an h.o. official while
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:17.800]  in the middle east and again there's a lot he can't
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:20.520]  say because he's on classified missions he said i'm going to get a lot of trouble
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:24.040]  he might get killed over this he's had friends that have been killed if a
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:27.240]  congressional hearings about this last time stuff came out
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:30.840]  but he said he's not going to sit there and watch that mother
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:35.160]  you know ask her why her son mr smith died
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:39.240]  well we know we know the al-qaeda security force in bin gazi hard as the
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:43.240]  state department security the general security came in and
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.920]  killed those people and the local bases were told stand down
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.240]  and the local cia base full of commandos did stand down
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:55.240]  and uh but he was confirming from two sources
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:58.280]  one nato one
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:03.720]  military in texas that well you heard it yesterday
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.880]  that indeed it was state department legal arms under the
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:13.160]  arms export operation legal on paper but not really legal because it was to
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:17.400]  groupless as terrorist sent down there and then it was actually what he called
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:24.200]  high energy weapons high impact weapons was the exact quote
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:29.160]  us stinger type missiles new generation not just the french
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:32.600]  missiles and stuff that got taken from qaddafi stores
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.840]  and that the ambassador sent cables saying i'm not going to be part of this
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:39.960]  this is going to blow back there was criticism the military we know was
[02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:43.720]  criticizing we know the joint chiefs have said they're against us publicly
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:47.000]  and i guess to try to get everybody in line they whacked
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.480]  stevens now dr corcy you heard what i just broke down there and i want to
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:54.440]  then get into some other issues in the few minutes we have left with you and
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:56.520]  then what you're coming on i think next week
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:59.640]  to talk about your book that's already a best-seller on who really killed
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:03.480]  kennedy i've been reading it it's intriguing info but
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:06.520]  pleaser you heard me just break that down i know you probably haven't heard the
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:10.600]  interview yet what is your intel because we said a week after it was an arms
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:13.560]  deal that's now been confirmed but they're covering up the details
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:17.720]  they've changed the identities of some of the whistleblowers
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:23.240]  who knows where they really are you heard what i just said from this
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:27.000]  famous uh cia pilot uh what is your take
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:31.160]  well i mean the begazi deal i think was entirely an arms deal
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:37.240]  uh the stevens was meeting with the one of the turkey
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:41.400]  diplomats the last dinner he had was with turkey one of the top
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:45.320]  turkey officials and they had to be discussing the shipment of arms i mean
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:47.800]  that was you know that one of the ships had been
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:52.200]  interdicted uh yet we were still trying to get arms into
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:59.080]  syria through turkey and we're also allowing transport for a lot of the
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:03.240]  al-qaeda rebels i mean it was a very complicated story
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:07.240]  because if you remember some of the attackers who came on
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:13.080]  scene of begazi said morse sent us it was uh they were sent by the egyptians
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.480]  or the egyptian link to causing the begazi attack
[02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:21.400]  was very clear and one of the other elements that they were pressing for
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:25.160]  is that the egyptians and morse won the release of this blind
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:32.440]  sheik who had mastermind in the 1993 um blowing up of the or the
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:35.800]  initial bomb in the basement of the world train center that didn't succeed in
[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:41.320]  bringing the towers down but it was that plot the idea was and it
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:46.840]  suggested again that um we could have a capture a hostage
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.520]  taking of our ambassador in exchange for the blind
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:54.840]  sheik um by the way alex this is just coming over
[02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:58.600]  the news now it looks like uh carry has signed the
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:04.440]  un arms treaty which um is completely in violation of the
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:09.080]  constitution because it's a treaty would have to be approved by the senate
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:14.520]  but the us arms treaty is a back door to eliminating the second amendment
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:20.360]  because us arms treaty un arms treaty calls for the ability of the un to
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:24.600]  come in and shut down any private ownership of
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:30.040]  uh of a firearms that could be um somehow or other tied to
[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:34.440]  international transported firearms and weapons well that's how they're banning
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:38.680]  these uh 3d printer guns uh is that they're saying
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:42.440]  it violates international uh arms agreement and there it is
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:46.200]  carry signs un arms treaty senator threatens to block it
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:49.880]  that just came out on fox news we're gonna we're gonna post it to info wars
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:52.920]  dot com and prison planet dot com right now
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.160]  it's huge news this is a huge move to try to
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:01.720]  backdoor the end to the second second amendment which is one of the major
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:05.240]  objectives of the obama administration the
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:10.120]  back door it goes right along with the ramping up of the nsa and the trying to
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:14.680]  keep the nsa under wraps you know we have a uh a gestapo
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:17.960]  intelligence system that hitler would have loved to add well sir let me ask
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:21.480]  you this in the five minutes we've got left dr corcy let me ask you this
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:24.600]  they have public schools under department of education now
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:28.520]  shang have you seen playing with a water gun or a plastic
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:32.440]  gun that shoots airsoft plastic pellets you're kicked out of school for an
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:35.800]  entire year nine months of school this is a reign of
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:40.680]  terror uh they are now having obama core people under acorn type
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:43.240]  groups come to your door with your social security
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:48.760]  number this is a total criminal takeover i i cannot believe how insane it is
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:51.320]  it's worse than i thought it's moving quicker
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:55.480]  it looks like it's now happening uh they're bad mouthing george washington
[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:59.480]  in the new army manuals we have entered twilight zone levels let me ask you
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:04.200]  this 17 to 19 and gallup trust the government all
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:06.680]  time low so people are waking up the military is
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:11.640]  waking up the police are waking up uh the system admits they're waking up
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:14.840]  but it appears the socialist cloward and piven
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:20.520]  banker run scum doesn't care and is going to go all the way so let me ask you
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.760]  this uh they're now obama now promised to the uh
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:28.360]  black caucus that he spoke to that he's quote fired up and will get the guns
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:32.360]  this year how do they think they're going to get this
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:36.520]  done what is their ace in the hole and historically
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:40.760]  what are we facing here because because i have never been more on edge
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:45.560]  in my life this is 10 times in my gut anything i've ever felt
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:49.640]  right now and and and i know everybody else is feeling it where are we dr
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:52.680]  coursey well the first of all you've got you know
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:57.080]  the always been a presumption that as this new world order crowd gets close to
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:00.200]  the finish line it'll be a naked dash to the
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:03.960]  to the finish line in other words they will not will get rid of all the
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:07.240]  pretenses they'll just come out and violate the first
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.800]  amendment violate the second amendment uh confiscate guns gun
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:15.640]  registration used by um those who want to eliminate the
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:18.680]  second amendment is the first step to gun confiscation
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:21.960]  once they know where the guns are they know where to go get them
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:27.960]  uh and the uh desensitizing of kids in the schools to think that guns are
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:32.200]  evil uh you know the all the discussion that we've seen
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.000]  even this navy yard shooting where the troops have been armed you go back to
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:42.520]  the clinton era disarming our troops our military on military
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:46.600]  bases which is a disgrace the troops have been armed but i mean now the school
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:49.960]  says you can't have toy guns at home that's totally illegal
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:53.160]  well and and i mean that's what i'm saying kids in the backyard playing with
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:56.440]  guns are now being disciplined in schools i mean they're being reported by
[02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:01.000]  neighbors and disciplined in schools uh the public school system is really
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:05.480]  just an increasingly a social control network
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:09.960]  um the the what's going on today also with ten crews
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:15.480]  uh the uh republican party i think is finally a group of the republican party
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:18.600]  is realizing that there's no fundamental difference
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:22.120]  between republicans and democrats if you're dealing with
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:27.480]  john mccain and lindsay graham and the the establishment republicans
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:31.640]  they are identical in their objectives to the democrats
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:35.080]  and they really don't want to defund obama care
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:38.520]  they want the increasing government care government involvement the
[02:43:38.520 --> 02:43:42.440]  increasing government supervision the increasing increasing
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:46.760]  government encroaching on the economy now what happens usually and i think we
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:51.560]  already had the first false flag attempted that was syria
[02:43:51.560 --> 02:43:56.840]  if obama could have sold that Assad was responsible for the chemical attacks
[02:43:56.840 --> 02:44:01.480]  and anybody united states had cared that would have been a
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.160]  impetus to go to war i think the they're looking for another
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:09.240]  impetus to go to war um fortunately the american people
[02:44:09.240 --> 02:44:14.440]  i think are waking up to alex and are saying enough but the the biggest
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.600]  fear the biggest threat is a collapse of the economy
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:24.680]  is a um a fundamental breakdown of the fiat money system
[02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:28.360]  in which by the way for folks that don't know that's really your forte from
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.200]  harvard you advise the biggest banks in the world you don't toot your horn
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:35.560]  you are a expert on international banking
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:40.120]  at what point are we right now on that and they can close down the international
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:45.720]  banking system create a crisis any day uh which is a series of
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:51.400]  a triggered series of bailouts that were not provided that began
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:55.880]  implosion in the EU which could carry over to the united states
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:45:00.200]  an implosion in the derivatives market which is you know something like a now
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:03.720]  a 700 trillion dollar market that no one truly
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:07.720]  understands there's any number of ways to implode the
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:13.560]  on the system with this much debt and the goal would be to collapse all the
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:17.480]  fiat currencies into one fiat currency
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:20.760]  probably issued by the international monetary fund
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:25.400]  or to propose an alternative to the dollar for international trade the new
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:28.680]  global str with a hundred trillion over a decade credit
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:31.800]  to back to bankers what they called for two years ago at davos
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:35.400]  and as usual doctor you have hit it right on the head that's why they're so
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:39.240]  arrogant they know something so horrible is coming total economic
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:43.320]  collapse that they're going to pose as saviors and we're going to do
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:47.240]  anything including registering and then turning in our guns
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:51.240]  and accepting brigade homeland and welcoming the army in
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:55.480]  because things are so bad we will be welcome and i will welcome them in if
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:58.840]  people are riding for two weeks straight and then it's all
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:01.640]  acclimated and then obama gets to be the savior
[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:07.400]  in kenya likely today you know the the first impulse is going to be to
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:11.640]  increase security give more power to the kenyan government in order to go up to
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:14.440]  the bad guy i'll call him for checkpoints here in mall security
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:17.960]  because of it forgetting that the kenyan government was the one who
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:21.240]  invited the bad guys into the first place
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:24.840]  you know then the government gets more power to police
[02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:28.120]  the terrorist problem the government invited into the country
[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:32.680]  and authorized through the constitution this new constitution to be able to
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:36.680]  have sharia law rights in the in the in the country
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:40.200]  i mean you basically by empowering the government
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.360]  are empowering the criminals that caused the problem by the way this was also
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:47.400]  racial as you know they don't only ask him who is muhammad's mother
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:51.400]  if you were white they shot you out of hand thinking he wouldn't be a muslim
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:55.160]  well and the you know i give the whole luo
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:01.240]  uh kakuyu overlay of you know tribal violence in kenya
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:04.840]  could break out again at any moment that's another
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:07.960]  tinderbox that's ready to explode at any instant
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:12.360]  but kenya is also on the edge financially you know without
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:16.520]  um you know kenya if kenya collapses or the international economy is collapsed
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:21.080]  further in africa you're going to have massive
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:25.000]  social unrest throughout africa right now throughout
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:28.280]  northern africa the economic activity is about
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:31.960]  gone to zero i mean you're you're struggling in libya to
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:36.920]  revitalize the oil industry where the country is still basically in the hands
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.080]  of terrorists who control the government incredible bottom line sir we'll let you
[02:47:41.080 --> 02:47:44.200]  go in 60 seconds bottom line how are things going for the
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:48.200]  new world order though i mean i i know they always use crises to get more
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:52.200]  power but if they get blamed for the crisis that they've helped execute
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:56.040]  could that could we see a fall in the new world order or at least
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:59.640]  damage because everything they're touching turns to you know what
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:03.160]  well and again this is why i'm working so hard and you are too elix to expose
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:06.840]  this agenda to make people aware that you know
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:10.360]  the that's why i wrote the book on kennedy we'll cover that later but
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:14.600]  it's again the whole exposure of this new world order agenda
[02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:19.640]  which is on intent on using intelligence agencies
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.400]  to lie intelligence agencies to control the population
[02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:29.880]  it's predicated on confiscating guns it tends to have a educational system
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:34.920]  with children are indoctrinated and to i have a police state
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.240]  in which the citizenry is disarmed those are the primary yeah bottom line the
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:42.920]  new world order is not a good deal for anybody but maybe one tips
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:47.000]  live in it if you if you do live in it you live in it as a slave
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:51.960]  you live in it provided you don't disagree and don't demand too much
[02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:55.640]  it's only going to be beneficial for a very small group at the top
[02:48:55.640 --> 02:49:01.240]  as any of these you know dictatorships or structures are benefiting the
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:04.520]  international businesses multinational corporations
[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:08.760]  that want the cheapest labor possible it's a destructive system
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:13.720]  that will not advance human human beings it won't have respect for human
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:16.760]  rights it's a race to the bottom powerfully said

[02:51:04.280 --> 02:51:07.960]  in circulating white blood cells this happens because nature designed us to
[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:11.320]  eat food that is undamaged at the molecular level
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:14.760]  when we heat food to normal cooking temperatures we change the shape of the
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:19.000]  molecules into shapes the body cannot use the body now looks at them as
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  toxins and allergens in an effort to protect itself from this irritant
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.600]  the body intelligently increases the amount of circulating white blood cells
[02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:29.880]  to act as garbage collectors white blood cells gobble up
[02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:33.400]  all the unusable damaged food particles to neutralize their cell damaging

[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:22.680]  up on infowarst.com this is bloomberg poll nearly half the nation views obama
[02:54:22.680 --> 02:54:28.440]  unfavorably folks that's a bloomberg baloney poll
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:32.680]  if you really look at all the polls obama's got about 30 support by idiots
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:37.240]  that are on welfare and that think he's their daddy
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:41.320]  i mean there's a gallop poll out showing 17 percent if you look at
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:44.360]  conservatives it's 19 if you just do the whole country
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:50.120]  19 support of government period congress has a 10 approval rating
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:54.200]  so just remember that when you see all these polls they are a load
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.400]  of bull
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:01.960]  i'm out there talking to the public you see the numbers you see the military
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:06.040]  military came out a few months ago and said nobody believes our psyops anymore
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:09.880]  so we're going to promise to tell the truth now that itself another psyop
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:13.960]  but the military people know what's going on william in tennessee
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:18.280]  listening on 14 70 am wb cr and we'll go to
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:21.960]  will and oklahoma listening on xm 244 you're on the year
[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:25.880]  william go ahead a couple things on mr cruz he's actually
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.400]  incorrect about um congress is like exempt from the health
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:32.920]  healthcare bill they're not exempt from it they require that they have to go to
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:35.800]  exchange with anybody else does it on on exchanges to get their health care
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:39.480]  benefit that they want to second of all that's not your your
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:44.760]  democratic seminar caller okay second of all put him on hold put him on hold this
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:49.080]  is a democratic i'll give you time in a minute but i actually
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:52.120]  know what you're going to say next i've heard the seminar calls i know what
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:54.920]  they are and and i don't mind we don't screen your
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:58.440]  calls sir so we're a different type of radio show but i will tell people when
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:02.920]  it's a seminar call that's not true that's a harry reid talking point
[02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:06.840]  um this is designed to bankrupt the country it was written by the insurance
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:10.360]  companies uh mit romney was behind it you democrats
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:15.400]  only care about the democratic party and you feel like you're on a winning team
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:20.520]  sir if i really wanted to hurt you guys i would not try to stop this going
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:22.840]  through that listen my dad's in health care

[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:31.320]  because he knows what it is okay and you don't know what you're talking about
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:35.720]  now you think you're gonna get some free deal did obama raise taxes on people
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:39.000]  making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year yes he did
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:42.680]  did obama signed the ndaa when he said he wouldn't did obama hire more lobbies
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:46.280]  anybody else did obama say that raising the debt limit
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:50.600]  did not raise the debt limit i don't mind having people that disagree but when
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:55.960]  they're spewing harry reid vomit like harry reid vomited it on
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:00.120]  william and then he vomited it on me
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:03.160]  now tell me who's talking point you're reading what
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:06.520]  what side is it from harry reid's side or white house dot gov and then if you're
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:09.000]  honest about it i'll let you read the points on air go ahead

[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:19.560]  the federal government saying this congress is not exempt
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:22.760]  and both the things that they want you there you go it's a white house
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.440]  baloney just like they have fact sheets at

[03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:46.200]  next you're gonna tell me this is what harry reid does and i know it's not
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:48.520]  true because i've actually looked at the bill
[03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:52.920]  that it wouldn't make people lay folks off
[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:57.080]  or cut them back from full time to part time that's what's happening
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:01:02.360]  and i've talked to the health care experts the lawyers i've looked at it all
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:07.800]  okay or what it means to my operation and um
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:10.440]  let me ask you this question way and then i'll let you talk a couple minutes
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:12.600]  because i don't want to sit here and laugh at you i apologize
[03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:16.200]  you sound like a nice guy actually you're just believing these people
[03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:19.640]  do you what do you think of obama overall i mean so i guess you think he's a
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:23.720]  good guy and uh or or tell me and you really
[03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:27.640]  think he and the insurance companies that wrote this
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:29.960]  they're doing this because they love us and care about us is that what you're
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:33.240]  saying the health care bill is this i think he's
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:36.120]  done a pretty good job so far but he's having issues of course every person
[03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:40.360]  it does um the health care bill is designed to allow people to have access
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:44.280]  to global health insurance through the exchanges on the open market that's
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:49.800]  what it is it's not government run if you have insurance through your
[03:01:49.800 --> 03:01:53.160]  company you can keep that that's fine but if you want insurance through the
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:56.040]  exchanges you can sign up for that and it is the exchanges
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:01:59.800]  now as far as you know what sir sir sir you know they said there weren't
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:04.360]  death panels in it when it does have these federal mandates in these panels
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:07.480]  and and i know health care i have a bunch of family and health care
[03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:11.560]  they have bioethics boards turning people off that are alive and talking
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:14.840]  all over the country they have the case for killing granny
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:18.280]  and i know you just your whole life is feeling like the government's your
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:23.000]  friend do you feel like your sports team one because obama got reelected
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:27.720]  that's a silly question alex that's a topic as far as the premiums go let me
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:30.280]  ask you this let me ask you this are you a government
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:33.640]  worker that's not your business alex on this first
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:37.080]  premiums go premiums for some will go up some will go down
[03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:40.520]  so on average they'll go down that you can suck you get a subsidy to help pay
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:43.720]  your premium so yes some will go up you're correct about that
[03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:48.280]  some will go ahead man well listen you're listen you're insulated at your irs
[03:02:48.280 --> 03:02:51.560]  job or your parts of all life job or whatever it is
[03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:57.400]  i mean i can just come on just say i'm wrong you you get a state funded payment
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:59.720]  don't you it doesn't matter what i do for living
[03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:02.680]  alex what i'm telling you is that on average you know why i know this because
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:05.560]  i hear you hey you're a winner man you're the
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:09.320]  winning team hey great it's gonna you heard it folks it's a great deal for
[03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:11.400]  everybody this guy's already got government
[03:03:11.400 --> 03:03:15.320]  healthcare he's already got it all set up he's believing the talking point
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:18.760]  you bean counters are in there you really believe your help in the country
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:22.520]  you know 20 billion to ship general motors to china all of it great
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:26.760]  obama loves us hey should he get another peace prize how about five more how's
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:30.200]  that sound that's a message who's healthcare alex you're
[03:03:30.200 --> 03:03:34.440]  going to topic again now as far as this is a seminar caller this guy is a
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:39.000]  seminar caller it is hold on a minute it is very pertinent
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:43.720]  well you listen to npr all day i'm sure this is on topic
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:47.000]  because it's pertinent that he's lied to us on everything else like he said
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.280]  don't worry i won't sign india a so there wouldn't be opposition turned out
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.120]  his lawyers demanded it and wrote it and then he signed it
[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:58.760]  did obama raise payroll taxes on the average people and lie about that
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:00.920]  no they're really going on topic might be healthcare
[03:04:00.920 --> 03:04:05.160]  i think a damn liar man you're going off topic alex you're trying to get me
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:08.440]  no i'm not off topic they've lied about everything
[03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:11.160]  they've lied about everything and you're calling and you're okay
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:15.080]  okay back on healthcare again um as i was saying before
[03:04:15.080 --> 03:04:18.120]  if you haven't sure if your company can keep it that's fine the exchange just
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:21.320]  said that they have insurance on the open market correct
[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:25.000]  no not correct because it's rigged to force everyone to buy it so that will
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.560]  drive up the price like any other commodity you're made to buy it how's
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:30.200]  the reason actually if you have your choice to buy it or not if you don't
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:32.440]  buy it there's a penalty that's why i trust you don't want to
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:36.200]  there's a penalty for that now the exchanges are set up in most states
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:40.200]  i'm gonna do that hey listen bro listen hey you're a winner

[03:08:20.440 --> 03:08:24.040]  increase our debt it does not somehow promote

[03:08:42.440 --> 03:08:46.760]  folks the country has 17 trillion dollars of debt communist china is the
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:49.960]  biggest owner of it after the private federal reserve
[03:08:49.960 --> 03:08:53.080]  they are teaching the military the founding fathers will not be welcomed
[03:08:53.080 --> 03:08:56.440]  today's military public schools are designed to
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:01.240]  completely take over the family obama care was written by the insurance
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:06.280]  companies and big banks to gang rape the american people
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:10.520]  uh i mean if i got into what the federal government's doing to healthcare
[03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:15.160]  right now and how it's designed to only let big hmo's and hospitals operate
[03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:19.160]  and how they're shutting down small clinics all over the country right now
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:24.440]  uh 60 plus percent of doctors over 50 i saw in a poll they're planning to retire
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:28.120]  early which is meant to bankrupt things under cloward and piven
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:32.760]  to socialize things and william calls in from tennessee
[03:09:32.760 --> 03:09:37.800]  where they're reporting some projections that it will triple men's premiums
[03:09:37.800 --> 03:09:42.920]  double women's and i remember reading the wall street journal the head of the
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:48.040]  big insurance consortiums laughing at the profits and how their stock shot up
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:52.280]  it's like owning stock in prisons or something i mean it's so immoral
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:56.680]  and i know all the inside baseball of it
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:10:03.000]  and this guy is calling in and in his voice you hear the confidence the
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:12.360]  arrogance the the enjoyment of obama and everything that's going on
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:17.720]  and and it just shows you don't matter how bad it gets it's like people that get
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:22.360]  the nigerian email that oh send me $5,000 i'm prince of booby
[03:10:22.360 --> 03:10:25.000]  literally oh you'll get 10 million next week
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.520]  i mean and for 15 years i tell people i know i say listen that's not real that's
[03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:31.080]  there you're just mad you didn't get the prince
[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:34.040]  i'm gonna be able to meet him after i helped him give him this money and then
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:36.760]  they give him the money and then and then and then well you know he's still
[03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:39.880]  really a prince and now in austin actually have people
[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:42.760]  that go around and say they're the prince from nigeria everybody bows down
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:45.720]  and stuff that's like the queen of england she's just a big war criminal
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:51.480]  globalist wears a crown everybody bows down and with this whole obama thing
[03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:54.920]  i mean they are screwing the american people to the wall they are
[03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:59.240]  arresting members of the press whistleblowers and expose corruption
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:03.400]  uh they are the ndaa and this guy just says you're changing the subject i mean
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:07.560]  they're hammering us on every front and i almost want obama care to go in
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:11.960]  except i know they plan on wrecking everything and then totally socializing
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:13.960]  it to get government control of the health care
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:17.800]  to carry out eugenics which is a stated plan
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:20.600]  and then i said that you know the the list room we're going back to him
[03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:24.360]  william and then others that are holding i said to him
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:28.360]  hey um you know this is all part of the death
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:31.960]  panels and stuff he's like oh that isn't real that i got bill gates saying it's
[03:11:31.960 --> 03:11:35.160]  it's in there and it's good i mean i i've got
[03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:40.280]  dashel who helped write the bill years before with the republicans
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:45.400]  saying we need death panels i mean i i'm informed i know they said this i've
[03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:48.520]  got the book over there that the white house science are wrote about putting
[03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:53.800]  fluoride in the water to sterilize us i know about the government putting
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:58.600]  uh syphilis in vaccines and stuff i know about the un putting
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:02.200]  sterilants in the vaccines i know about the facts and then this
[03:12:02.200 --> 03:12:05.800]  person just laughs and says what does that have to do with it that's
[03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:09.640]  changing the subject it's like saying hitler said he wouldn't invade any
[03:12:09.640 --> 03:12:13.560]  more countries after he went into danzig and then he went into
[03:12:13.560 --> 03:12:16.840]  and then well he lied why doesn't matter hitler now says he's going to do this
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:22.360]  for me and again getting past obama he's just a puppet in the final equation
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:27.080]  it is so sick sir listing to you is just amazing
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:31.000]  you know they're probably not going to be able to repeal it
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.560]  and because the big banks want this let me ask you this obama's biggest
[03:12:35.560 --> 03:12:39.400]  contributors were goldman sacks jp morgan and then the defense
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:45.000]  industry weapons makers after that i mean so you
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.960]  you just say oh nobody's perfect obama's not perfect
[03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:51.240]  i know there's a lot of astroturf a lot of paid people too out there
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:54.440]  it's it's hard for me to believe you're really you don't sound stupid
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:59.400]  that you're actually calling into this show let me ask you this let me see if
[03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:03.640]  you'll answer this honestly or we'll know your seminar caller
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:07.480]  is it a lie to say raising the debt doesn't raise the debt
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:11.960]  is that a orwellian two plus two equals five
[03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:16.520]  uh common core type deal i mean i mean he is raising the debt
[03:13:16.520 --> 03:13:20.280]  raising the debt sir that's not that's not what he's saying
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:23.720]  he's saying that he's the amount the government can borrow
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:26.760]  is raised doesn't have to raise the debt and you have to do it it will if you
[03:13:26.760 --> 03:13:29.880]  is but we would borrow the money yes it will but they are they are borrowing
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:32.840]  money no no no they raised it to borrow more they
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:35.800]  it was already borrowed they'd frozen it for a few months it was already that
[03:13:35.800 --> 03:13:40.360]  was another orwellian lie that freezing it freezing it
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:43.320]  uh that it wasn't going up but it was going up
[03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:48.920]  they just faked the numbers okay but just go ahead and tell me about obama
[03:13:48.920 --> 03:13:51.880]  uh do you think so so there are no death panels
[03:13:51.880 --> 03:13:54.520]  there isn't the newsweek case for killing granny
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:59.080]  mpr every day isn't promoting euthanasia um none of this is happening
[03:13:59.080 --> 03:14:03.720]  everything's good then all right first of all one article doesn't mean your
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:07.000]  death panels second of all okay that's what you're talking
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:11.240]  about is you're talking about end of health decisions paid for by
[03:14:11.240 --> 03:14:15.080]  the health care act talking to doctor by end of health decisions
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:19.560]  it's not a death panel all right that's right that's right the doctor
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:24.040]  and the family has the decision taken away that's right no that's not true at
[03:14:24.040 --> 03:14:27.240]  all the doctor and his family makes decision i don't know where your face
[03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:30.520]  coming from but that's not true the family and doctors make the decision
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:33.640]  based on what the family and the doctors feel like as a team all right that's
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:36.600]  what that means there's no death panel is going to kill you it's the bioethics
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:40.920]  committee second of all well second of all
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:44.440]  as far as i know you heard i thought i'd ask about um
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:47.400]  obama he didn't he overall did a pretty good job
[03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:51.240]  you got some mistakes everybody does sure but overall you got bad
[03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:55.800]  do you think sodium fluoride and the water supply is a good thing
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:58.360]  i'm not going to be forwarded that's long been proven that it is i'm not going
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:01.240]  to be forwarded with you second of all no oh you're not going to debate well
[03:15:01.240 --> 03:15:05.320]  we're not going to talk anymore because fluoride fluoride say now
[03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:09.400]  um okay what's next on your list what's next on your list
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:14.120]  what's your next point well a fluoride fine what's what which one with fluoride
[03:15:14.120 --> 03:15:17.640]  fine that's just talking about fluoride then
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:21.480]  fun and don't go to harvard study that's not what the harvard study says but go
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:25.560]  ahead oh really the harvard study shows an iq drop
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:29.480]  it indexes what 24 other studies and there are literally thousands of others
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:32.680]  as well what the harvard study says is that it's 27
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:35.960]  cases in china and iran is massive doses of natural fluoride
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:39.400]  the conclusions of the studies say there are no conclusions based on this we can
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:43.320]  fly to the united states now no what they said is they said at
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:48.200]  1.6 parts per million is what the study says
[03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:52.200]  man you are unbelievable so so do you have any children
[03:15:52.200 --> 03:15:56.280]  yes i have two kids is better fact and and do you buy the fluoride water at the
[03:15:56.280 --> 03:15:59.480]  store for them no i don't buy water i use it
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:03.000]  tap water and water is expensive
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:07.320]  do you even filter out the chlorine and stuff do you think chlorine's good
[03:16:07.320 --> 03:16:10.760]  i've been up there for 42 years and i'm not sick from fluoride chlorine
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:14.600]  well well i guess my kids are not sick let me tell you uh a cancer of the
[03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:19.160]  bladder is way up and it's directly linked to chlorine which i think we need
[03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:22.600]  to purify the water but you need to filter that out
[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:27.080]  no i don't think so but anyway back to the um hold on you're you're hold on
[03:16:27.080 --> 03:16:31.000]  minute yeah okay what about vaccines uh you
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.960]  think those are great no matter what i say you're going to
[03:16:33.960 --> 03:16:36.520]  do with me and let me ask you this question do you think it's good that
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:41.800]  there's forcibly sterilizing currently poor women in california
[03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:47.240]  what do you think the forced sterilization currently going on
[03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:51.000]  no it's currently eugenics sterilization is going on in california pull up a
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:55.880]  before no no there's not now back to vaccines hold on sir hold on sir

[03:17:09.560 --> 03:17:12.440]  back to vaccines yes there are vaccines that have
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:16.040]  uh viruses in them they're stunned that's how it works
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:19.800]  a vaccine does have a live virus to to make the body react to it does not have a
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:22.600]  live virus it has an attenuated virus and the real
[03:17:22.600 --> 03:17:25.880]  graphs show that vaccines are increasing they're actually causing the
[03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:29.160]  diseases no that's not true how come then they're not
[03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:33.560]  going to have to measure infusion polio or you know anything like that sir tens
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:36.360]  of thousands of people got paralyzed in india alone
[03:17:36.360 --> 03:17:39.960]  because of them giving them in that case live polio vaccine

[03:17:43.400 --> 03:17:47.160]  the vaccine no let me ask you a question we're
[03:17:47.160 --> 03:17:51.880]  going to skip this network break so you really believe sir sir
[03:17:51.880 --> 03:17:55.000]  listen just be honest with me you know who i am i'm a radio talk show host in

[03:18:26.120 --> 03:18:29.240]  other than that i think we're fine
[03:18:30.600 --> 03:18:33.960]  i figured it out you're a social worker aren't you
[03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:37.240]  how did what what did you think that
[03:18:38.040 --> 03:18:43.640]  yeah because you're on a power trip i'm on a power trip i'm i'm a part of my
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:46.440]  thing i think you're not much medicine for everybody what kind of social worker
[03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:49.720]  are you that's not that's not good this is what i am
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:54.360]  alex and you do a lot of bad stuff don't you
[03:18:54.360 --> 03:18:57.960]  let me ask you a question let me ask you a question do you think the the family
[03:18:57.960 --> 03:19:03.720]  belongs to a bygone arcane age no do you agree with msnbc when they
[03:19:03.720 --> 03:19:06.680]  say that the family is not part of the equation now
[03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:11.160]  that it's the it's the state and the community that runs thanks
[03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:14.840]  no i mean the community is involved but no
[03:19:14.840 --> 03:19:18.920]  what do you think about neighbors see kids playing with the toy guns in the
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:22.520]  backyard so they're kicked out of school one incident
[03:19:22.520 --> 03:19:25.800]  i don't know the facts well no i mean it's on record i mean my
[03:19:25.800 --> 03:19:28.520]  point is you was it you don't believe in a right to
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:32.760]  keep their arms do you or your right means we turn them in right
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:37.640]  um certain firearms should be burst and regulated yes others shouldn't
[03:19:37.640 --> 03:19:40.760]  so you really see in your life your personal destiny
[03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:44.760]  is you expand in power as the state expands in power
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:49.960]  no what kind of social worker are you i work with kids
[03:19:49.960 --> 03:19:54.040]  you work with kids mm god i don't know how i know all this stuff
[03:19:54.040 --> 03:19:56.520]  i have to help them get into school help them get paid to live and help them get
[03:19:56.520 --> 03:19:59.720]  set up in in apartments help them get cars help them get their uh get their
[03:19:59.720 --> 03:20:03.320]  school paid for yeah and everybody else is a kid and the state
[03:20:03.320 --> 03:20:06.920]  is the daddy and you're gonna show us how everything runs
[03:20:06.920 --> 03:20:10.600]  i'm gonna help them get life skills yes i want to encourage you to do something
[03:20:10.600 --> 03:20:13.800]  i want to encourage you to take every vaccine they recommend it's more than
[03:20:13.800 --> 03:20:18.360]  50 a year i take vaccines i'm perfectly healthy
[03:20:18.360 --> 03:20:22.760]  i bet you do buddy i'm perfectly healthy i take vaccines
[03:20:22.760 --> 03:20:27.240]  what do you think of your what do you think of your social worker counterparts
[03:20:27.240 --> 03:20:30.680]  uh the deal do you deal with the small children
[03:20:30.680 --> 03:20:35.960]  no they're all up they're all over 18 yeah how do you think i knew you were a
[03:20:35.960 --> 03:20:42.120]  social worker cold reading pardon me cold reading
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:46.280]  you you took clues from what i said and assumed it
[03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:53.000]  man listen i've been places that uh you'll probably never be okay and i've
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:56.280]  seen things you haven't seen obviously i just feel
[03:20:56.280 --> 03:21:00.040]  sorry for you man and i appreciate your call
[03:21:00.760 --> 03:21:04.440]  they are domesticating us they are collectivizing us that guy was a house
[03:21:04.440 --> 03:21:09.480]  slave what he was he was a house slave the
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:13.000]  romans figured it out they would bring the women but the men are like that now
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:16.920]  too into the house into the castle they would teach
[03:21:16.920 --> 03:21:20.600]  him that you know your it's your job to rule over
[03:21:20.600 --> 03:21:24.440]  the male slaves and the children that are out there in the barn
[03:21:24.440 --> 03:21:30.360]  this is done with the romans and the goths and the galls that's the french today
[03:21:30.360 --> 03:21:35.080]  and they they they're always the greatest defenders
[03:21:35.080 --> 03:21:38.600]  of the system and you can just hear it it's a
[03:21:38.600 --> 03:21:43.400]  it's a spirit it's not that i've read things he was saying it was the
[03:21:43.400 --> 03:21:49.480]  it was the enjoyment it was the because i've been in the family court when the
[03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:52.520]  family's crying and they go it's okay it's for your own good
[03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:58.200]  but then they also get off on the power and i heard the enjoyment
[03:21:58.360 --> 03:22:03.320]  i heard the enjoyment on seeing everyone having to come to him and being
[03:22:03.320 --> 03:22:07.960]  dependent the domestication the power he's a priest
[03:22:07.960 --> 03:22:12.840]  see i'm a priest of empowerment of human liberty i like to see real
[03:22:12.840 --> 03:22:16.120]  empowerment i believe in the individual i believe in
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:21.080]  decentralizing power you believe in centralizing it
[03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:25.320]  and if you look at the actuaries you know that guy was probably 30 years old
[03:22:25.320 --> 03:22:29.320]  33 years old 34 years old
[03:22:29.320 --> 03:22:34.120]  he'll probably die 20 30 years early because the soft kill's intensifying
[03:22:34.120 --> 03:22:37.400]  now if he even lives through what's coming up if they don't release the
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:42.440]  bio weapons imagine a government on on record
[03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:45.960]  that's done thousands of lethal experiments killing troops foster kids
[03:22:45.960 --> 03:22:49.480]  you name it and this guy wants to take shots
[03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:53.560]  they're pushing he's not going to go look up any of this stuff
[03:22:53.560 --> 03:22:56.440]  he listens to the show and he thinks i'm full of bull
[03:22:56.440 --> 03:23:00.520]  and he goes and picks through things and tries to find the whitewash that
[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:04.760]  you know the harvard study puts in there so they don't get sued
[03:23:04.760 --> 03:23:10.280]  as a proviso and just says everything's fine
[03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:16.680]  that guy ought to go back and listen to that and and wonder how i can tell
[03:23:16.680 --> 03:23:19.880]  man i just know how government people talk and i know how certain groups have
[03:23:19.880 --> 03:23:23.000]  marked as they're programmed let's go another phone call
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.400]  sorry to be eating on the air i just haven't eaten since early this morning
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:28.840]  i'm starving uh robert i know that was hard to listen to thank you for joining
[03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:32.120]  us what do you think of that victim
[03:23:32.120 --> 03:23:35.720]  well i'm telling you alex that chuckle in his voice
[03:23:35.720 --> 03:23:40.200]  just really gave me a creeped out feeling they're coming for us too bud
[03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:44.200]  they're shutting off their infrastructure so we need them
[03:23:44.200 --> 03:23:48.280]  that that that literally kind of took my breath away just was like you said that
[03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:52.120]  little chuckle in his voice you could just hear me tell you when they
[03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:55.880]  check people's kids that's what they do and yeah i've actually i've
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:23:59.640]  actually rolled around on the ground and vomited before after i was around them
[03:23:59.640 --> 03:24:04.280]  that's why i knew it almost gave me the feeling this morning
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:09.320]  after watching ted cruise uh jump off the line and then
[03:24:09.320 --> 03:24:15.240]  john mccain actually got on there and just the the listening to him and
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:19.240]  knowing that he spent 21 million dollars to be reelected
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:24.440]  in his last campaign when he only gets paid 174 thousand dollars
[03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:28.280]  it just makes me sick to see these people in power
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:32.520]  and to think that they're on this power trip and it just makes me sick and
[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:36.920]  ill to my stomach to know that they're not out for the goodness of mankind
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:40.200]  and then the goodness for you and me they're out just for ultimate
[03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:44.360]  control control and destruction of this country
[03:24:44.360 --> 03:24:48.200]  and if you look around the world they're just taking picking countries down
[03:24:48.200 --> 03:24:52.600]  one at a time and if they can take down the united states of america
[03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:56.360]  it's a freefall after that because we're the only ones that are going to be
[03:24:56.360 --> 03:25:00.280]  able to pull this off and save the world when it comes down to it
[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:04.040]  and and he's hearing his voice and just thinking that there's actually people
[03:25:04.040 --> 03:25:09.160]  like that that get off on that it just oh it just makes me sick to my stomach
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:13.160]  it's it's disgusting you notice when i predicted he was a social worker out of
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:18.360]  the hundreds of jobs that are out there he got a little shook up
[03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:23.160]  yeah he kept telling you you know that just jumping from one subject to another
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:29.240]  and uh he couldn't stay with you and your interview yesterday alex and i got
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:33.560]  to commend you that was just bombshell the information that you broke yesterday
[03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:37.800]  thank you man that was awesome oh god bless you too
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:43.800]  i just this is a exhilarating job at one level but it's also very depressing
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:49.400]  um to to to it's one thing when they jerk these little babies away from these
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:55.080]  mothers that have done nothing or the dad goes in uh to get an
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:58.120]  insurance test and has marijuana in his blood so they come and take the two-year
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:01.960]  old child and they're at court and and they're like we have family
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:05.960]  lit and then the and then the weirdo judge is always the same and gets off on
[03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:10.440]  it and the cps workers get off on the pain and you watch them getting off on
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:13.560]  the pain it's like a power trip and they're always real weak but they have
[03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:18.280]  that giggle it's a demonic spirit basically and
[03:26:18.280 --> 03:26:21.320]  i mean i know them i know they're uniformed by their voice
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:24.760]  and it and i mean i'm not kidding folks i've cried over this one i've seen
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:29.240]  them feeding on the families i've actually thrown up it hurts so bad
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:33.480]  and that's why i've i've gotten so angry uh is uh but you know what
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:39.880]  think of being that guy how pathetic he is think about how small and dumb and
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:43.240]  and gang memberish it is to feel like he's part of this big government
[03:26:43.240 --> 03:26:47.400]  when the history of government is so clear they really believe they're
[03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:52.040]  helping people the useful idiot type like him
[03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:57.320]  and they'll turn to blind eye to anything before they admit they're in the
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:01.000]  wrong thank you robert let's talk to dan in kentucky dan

[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:17.720]  our own food and stuff like that i mean part of the thing is this is a digital
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:21.640]  monster and we need to stop feeding it you know what no we have to understand
[03:27:21.640 --> 03:27:25.160]  the government has good people in it but it's run
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:29.160]  by the eugenicist globalist that might as well be aliens from a trillion miles
[03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:32.360]  away come to kill us i mean they're that anti human
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:36.120]  that anti family and they're coming for us

[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:06.840]  what we need to do is stop giving them numbers to no i agree anybody that can
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:10.440]  needs to decouple from the system like the illegal aliens do
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:14.360]  and just comply with nothing and teach your children that the government might
[03:28:14.360 --> 03:28:17.160]  as well be aliens from a trillion miles away
[03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:20.600]  come to suck your soul i mean it is they are the enemy
[03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:24.440]  from front to back and and and and they they are

[03:28:57.000 --> 03:29:01.800]  hey buddy uh i had a dream uh that i would be judged by the results of my
[03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:04.840]  capability not the contents of my wallet
[03:29:04.840 --> 03:29:10.440]  and uh i recently made an entry for the health and human services video contest
[03:29:10.440 --> 03:29:15.400]  and uh it was kind of an info bomb and censored myself in fear of retaliation
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:18.680]  and persecution in a one-second scene where obama
[03:29:18.680 --> 03:29:21.960]  snorts a nanobots line in the shape of america
[03:29:21.960 --> 03:29:25.720]  and blows his nose and 800 dollars do you think that
[03:29:25.720 --> 03:29:30.600]  sort of uh self-censorship is a safe bet or am i holding myself back no no
[03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:32.920]  that's a great way uh to enter all their fake
[03:29:32.920 --> 03:29:36.760]  contests and everything with your own info post it publicly
[03:29:36.760 --> 03:29:39.880]  let's attack them i mean if all of us just do a little bit it's over
[03:29:39.880 --> 03:29:44.360]  just non-compliant when you see them let them know that you don't like them
[03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:47.560]  don't give them any fear they want you to be scared of them just let them know
[03:29:47.560 --> 03:30:15.640]  they're filth and you hate them that's the most important thing
