[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  Well, it's another information overload on the Sunday, March 3rd, 2019, global broadcast.
[00:29.920 --> 00:36.240]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, here in studio. The conspiracy theories, the speculations
[00:36.240 --> 00:40.560]  already begun all over the internet. Alex Jones tried to beat up Eddie Bravo, like I was joking
[00:40.560 --> 00:46.400]  in studio. I would do on Joe Rogan's record podcast last Wednesday. And no, I had a ruptured bicep.
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.280]  I had surgery scheduled for Friday. Going back two weeks ago, I had surgery Friday. It's supposed
[00:51.280 --> 00:56.800]  to be in a sling, but these modern systems actually have a plastic encasing. So I'm able to drive,
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.000]  you name it, thanks to the developments of science. So I'm doing good. Thanks for all your
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.200]  support. But no, Eddie Bravo did not do any backflip karate attacks on me or Jiu-Jitsu, even though
[01:07.200 --> 01:11.840]  I'm sure he would have kicked my ass. I was joking when I said I'd beat him up. And he kept
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.400]  denying that the government was killing babies after they were born. Eddie obviously knew that
[01:16.400 --> 01:21.120]  that was happening and was teasing me. And I figured it out halfway through. And it was basically
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.120]  WWE wrestling without any of the pre-pre-preparation for it. It was like
[01:28.480 --> 01:33.280]  Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan acting like they were fighting. It wasn't real, but everyone thinks
[01:33.280 --> 01:38.720]  that Eddie tore my arm out of socket. And that's not what happened. Actually though, if you want
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.760]  to get incredibly technical before getting into all the crazy news, I went to a steakhouse with Joe
[01:43.760 --> 01:53.200]  after the record podcast. And my bicep was already really torn and ripped. And so we're walking out
[01:53.200 --> 01:58.960]  into this parking garage and I stumble over one of those little dividers so your car doesn't drive
[01:58.960 --> 02:07.520]  over. And Joe, lightning fast reflexes, grabs my arm. They tore the bicep even worse, which is good
[02:07.520 --> 02:11.440]  because then they can fix it even better. But if you technically want to get there, it wasn't Eddie
[02:11.440 --> 02:17.200]  did some backflip on me or some jiu-jitsu move. It was Joe Rogan, but not intentional. But maybe
[02:17.200 --> 02:22.400]  it was karma. Maybe I went too far, my attacks on Joe. And so the next morning was all black and
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.400]  blue again. But luckily I had surgery scheduled the next day. So it was all perfect. It all worked
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.640]  out. But that's what the doctor said. He said, once the main tendon blows, it all just starts
[02:32.640 --> 02:36.640]  ripping out. That's why you see old men like have a collapse bicep a lot of times. And they call it
[02:36.640 --> 02:40.480]  the Popeye syndrome where the muscles weigh up here at the top because there's no tendons.
[02:40.480 --> 02:46.000]  That's basically what happened. So I've just spent two or three minutes on something that doesn't
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.400]  matter. But that's why I've got this giant, giant cast. This is a modern cast. There's a cast under
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.200]  there. But again, it's plastic so they can reset it. So that's what's going on here. Okay,
[02:59.040 --> 03:04.080]  we have a particularly important news day when we come back from break. And I'm just going to leave
[03:04.080 --> 03:11.040]  it at that. This is a CNS news as links to AP you name it health and human services. That's the
[03:11.040 --> 03:18.080]  federal government extends contract to continue making humanized mice with aborted baby parts for
[03:18.080 --> 03:25.200]  another 90 days. So we'll be looking at all that and the fact that we've got governor Northam
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.160]  continuing to defend keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs. That's our central
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.240]  big inch a lot of broadcast the attack on the family, the attack on humans, this anti human
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.680]  future, the globalists are trying to build. Then that translates into the Canadian Supreme Court
[03:41.680 --> 03:47.680]  ruling. The government will take your children from you and forcibly sterilize them. If they can
[03:47.680 --> 03:53.920]  trick them wants to say they want to be transgendered. So no age of consent. It's not a pervert,
[03:53.920 --> 03:57.920]  you know, regular child molester coming to your door. It's the government. They trick your seven,
[03:57.920 --> 04:04.080]  eight, nine, 10, 12 year old, whatever the case is to say they want to be under sex. They take you
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.600]  away from your parents and chop your wave owes off. That is the Canadian Supreme Court will get to
[04:09.600 --> 04:16.560]  all of that coming up. A lot of former top Olympians are coming out and saying that, you know, this
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.960]  is insane that men are not winning all the swimming. They're winning the wrestling. They're winning
[04:22.960 --> 04:29.200]  the races because they're men. They're men. You just say, Oh, I'm a woman and love me. And then
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.240]  then they went all the all the races. Women are saying this is an attack on women existing. Yes,
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.160]  I'm glad women are now figuring that out. And then we've got the big inch a lot of first when we
[04:38.160 --> 04:43.920]  come back. A lot of top Democrats are coming out endorsing Trump. There's almost no news coverage
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.400]  of it. Van Jones. We've got so many other people as well. John Stuart, that's straight ahead. What
[04:50.400 --> 04:56.160]  does this signify that highlights of CPAC censorship and CPAC? It's a big broadcast. Stay with us.
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.120]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there
[05:05.120 --> 05:09.200]  for my children someday. That's why I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my
[05:09.200 --> 05:14.880]  children. Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned,
[05:14.880 --> 05:18.400]  but not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're
[05:18.400 --> 05:23.520]  even better. Getting rid of what you said they were before. It's so much easier to burn video or
[05:23.520 --> 05:29.440]  text or languages now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it? But I have joined my will to
[05:29.440 --> 05:34.320]  the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long as I realize I've done right and as long as the
[05:34.320 --> 05:39.520]  people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.320]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place,
[05:44.320 --> 05:49.360]  the transcend space and time. When you commit the word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread
[05:49.360 --> 05:54.320]  our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now
[05:54.320 --> 05:59.760]  commit to support Info Wars however you can and realize your provision to Info Wars is your own
[05:59.760 --> 06:10.560]  provision. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[06:10.560 --> 06:21.680]  Info War.
[06:27.040 --> 06:34.320]  Our government has been publicly funding human animal hybrids for 40 years,
[06:34.320 --> 06:43.040]  but now they're publicly putting it in the newspaper and they've extended contracts to
[06:43.040 --> 06:53.040]  continue human mice hybrids for organ harvesting. HHS extends contract to make humanized mice
[06:53.040 --> 06:58.880]  with aborted baby parts for another 90 days. We're going to be getting to that and again,
[06:58.880 --> 07:05.440]  why do they do it? Because once they mix the genetics of an animal with a human, then they
[07:05.440 --> 07:13.440]  can say the human has no rights. That's going to tie into Governor Ralph Northam who said that
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.800]  they keep babies alive and harvest their organs. And when he got in trouble, they had it in his
[07:18.800 --> 07:24.320]  file that he was in blackface. They activated that to go ahead and distract from what he was doing
[07:24.320 --> 07:30.720]  at that point. So we're going to go behind the shadow government, behind the breakaway civilization
[07:30.720 --> 07:37.920]  here today and to tell all that. Also the Democrat Party, basically find out about the Chai comms,
[07:37.920 --> 07:44.720]  the globalists and others, they have come out and as I told you they would do because they'd
[07:44.720 --> 07:50.400]  actually admitted this before. It was in more like party emails and communications that we got but
[07:50.400 --> 07:56.960]  wasn't really publicly announced but it was publicly admitted. To launch 80-plus investigations as
[07:56.960 --> 08:03.680]  soon as the Mueller report comes out, which is set to come out any day now. And then they're going
[08:03.680 --> 08:10.560]  to go after everybody under the sun, none of it Russia related. Democrats prepare for end
[08:10.560 --> 08:17.680]  of Robert Mueller probe with new investigations. And then we've got, well, the amazing speech,
[08:17.680 --> 08:24.640]  record long two hour plus speech of Trump at CPAC. Very eloquent, very powerful.
[08:26.080 --> 08:32.080]  Show you how much energy this 72-year-old has. Then the bad side of that, Laura Loomer's joining
[08:32.080 --> 08:38.160]  us next hour. She's top story on right hand side, rogerport.com. Let's get a journalist,
[08:38.160 --> 08:48.400]  conservative. Laura Loomer got thrown out because she saw Oliver Darcy, the CNN thought police commissar
[08:49.680 --> 08:52.800]  and she went over and said, how dare you brag, you take people off the internet.
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.880]  Well, he complained about her and had her thrown out. This guy is like God. No one watches him,
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.600]  nobody likes him but he wants your website or you're taking off Twitter, Facebook or YouTube.
[09:03.600 --> 09:09.120]  It happens. I mean, the arrogance and she politely talked to this slime bag, but right wingwatch run
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.760]  by the Southern Prairie Law Center, an offshore criminal organization. I complained about it
[09:13.760 --> 09:21.520]  so she was thrown out. So she'll be joining us. That's all coming up. But the first big thing I
[09:21.520 --> 09:30.880]  want to get to is incredibly exciting. And I've been trying to really cogitate on it and figure
[09:30.880 --> 09:44.240]  out exactly what it means. That's basically Democrats leaving the sinking ship, hedging their
[09:44.240 --> 09:51.120]  bets, having a paying of conscience and realizing that they're really committed to a party of pure
[09:51.120 --> 10:01.200]  evil. But I'm going to cover it next segment because I need time. What am I talking about?
[10:02.560 --> 10:07.520]  I'm talking about Van Jones coming out and admitting that Trump's done a great job
[10:09.360 --> 10:14.400]  with criminal justice reform and that governors and Republican states are the only ones to be
[10:14.400 --> 10:21.120]  cutting crime while cutting prison populations and not giving black people longer sentences
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.800]  than white people. I mean, Van Jones finally either shows he's got a soul
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.200]  or he realizes that the Republicans and all the internal polling everywhere else are winning
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.320]  and so now he wants to jump ship. Because when he said, oh, I'm not going to join your party yet,
[10:38.320 --> 10:45.920]  he signals he about to become a Republican. Maybe it's bad to be a propagandist, a mercenary
[10:45.920 --> 10:54.000]  for the globalist. And then the left called for his destruction. He's a racist. He's a demon now
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.440]  for doing this. And then we got John Stuart. This got no attention. John Stuart came out and endorsed
[10:59.440 --> 11:04.000]  Trump for actually getting all the congressional fundings that have been bipartisan blocked
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.760]  for decades to take care of the firefighters, police and others who breathe the deadly dust.
[11:10.320 --> 11:14.080]  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been blocked from them. He endorsed Trump.
[11:14.080 --> 11:17.600]  That got zero attention. They didn't come out and demonize John Stuart.
[11:18.240 --> 11:22.400]  He said he did a press conference. I want attention. I want out this. This to be out.
[11:22.400 --> 11:29.200]  Trump's doing a great job. No coverage. There's a lot of other examples of that. So Trump's doing
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.520]  a lot of stuff that is super revolutionary and incredibly common sense, but he's not getting
[11:33.520 --> 11:39.200]  any support for it. But those of us that have supported Trump doing the right thing,
[11:39.200 --> 11:41.680]  all we get is demonization and lies and attacks.
[11:44.160 --> 11:47.760]  I support the president thinking he's done a great job many ways. He's done a bad job on
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.640]  some things. Nobody's perfect. But when I went on Joe Rogan's podcast, that's now the second
[11:52.640 --> 11:56.480]  biggest in history, said to be the largest podcast in the world within about three days of
[11:56.480 --> 12:02.080]  current growth rates. It's up about 20-something million views right now on iTunes and on YouTube.
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.200]  Not to count other platforms. It's over 20 million right now.
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.000]  I just said I resent Trump because the way the media frames it, he becomes my identity.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.200]  When I was promoting populism, nationalism, anti-globalism, free market systems before
[12:17.200 --> 12:21.120]  Trump ever wrote it on the wave, I'm not against Trump. It's just that I'm not Donald Trump.
[12:23.600 --> 12:26.640]  And I don't mind being attacked for supporting Trump. It's just that
[12:26.640 --> 12:35.840]  I cover so many other things than what Trump's involved in. And the left things,
[12:35.840 --> 12:39.680]  if they can destroy me, they destroy Trump and they don't understand even what's going on.
[12:39.680 --> 12:45.760]  So that's coming up as well. But when we come back, I'll get into why I think John Stewart and
[12:45.760 --> 12:48.800]  Van Jones have endorsed Trump and said he's doing the right thing.
[12:48.800 --> 12:56.480]  And what I think that portends in the future. And then
[12:58.880 --> 13:07.840]  we're going to get into the really bad news. The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the
[13:07.840 --> 13:13.680]  state will take your children from you. England already does this. Many European states do it
[13:13.680 --> 13:18.000]  as well. If they can convince your autistic or mentally retarded child they're really a boy
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.640]  or a girl or they're not because they want the eugenicists back to Hitler want to sterilize
[13:22.640 --> 13:26.960]  mentally retarded autistic kids. So they convince them and tell them they're stars.
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.080]  If they get sterilized and then they convince your mentally retarded child or autistic child to
[13:32.080 --> 13:37.360]  be sterilized, then they're taken and sterilized and the Supreme Court's rule they can take your
[13:37.360 --> 13:44.080]  child and sterilize them. You can't say anything. So it's serious eugenics, child abuse on record.
[13:44.080 --> 13:49.600]  We have the whole diagram and it's just being done. We've turned our children over the biggest
[13:49.600 --> 13:55.680]  predators in society and it's a sin before God and it's very, very dangerous. So that's coming
[13:55.680 --> 14:00.320]  up as well. And a lot of other clips that I haven't mentioned. So that's what's happened today.
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.320]  That said, I have something very exciting to announce. You know, for over a year I told
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.680]  you we were doing our last run of X2, the purest, cleanest, best iodine up until that point.
[14:11.680 --> 14:19.600]  Because it's not out of the ocean like other iodines that are then bound to other compounds.
[14:19.600 --> 14:24.480]  It's pure deep earth crystals. You got to jump through DEA hoops because it's so pure and they
[14:24.480 --> 14:31.680]  can use it as a derivative in drug manufacturing. Iodine is a key electrochemical processor in
[14:31.680 --> 14:40.000]  the body. You must have it to live like oxygen or water. And so I played Gutsball with the
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  manufacturers and the people that developed it and bring it out. And it's been sold out for
[14:46.000 --> 14:53.200]  about almost three months. But we have now had the same company, the original X2, developed it again
[14:53.760 --> 15:00.240]  and we were able to do the exact same formula. And so it'll be back within a week or so.
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.960]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there. Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.840]  Learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it. Learn about how the other iodines are bound.

[15:21.040 --> 15:27.280]  to a 15-point higher IQ average once the government added a crappy type just to salt. It's something
[15:27.280 --> 15:35.920]  that's not often talked about by so-called mainstream experts, but the power of iodine is shown throughout modern history.
[15:35.920 --> 15:40.240]  So again, in the early 1920s it was found that just adding iodine, the sea salt and iodine
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.920]  deficiency resulted in a staggering 15-point IQ increase. This is way beyond that. Find out the
[15:45.920 --> 15:52.480]  truth at infowarslife.com or infowarstore.com. X2 is back. Thousands and thousands of five-star
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.520]  reviews. X2 is back. Thank God. X3 is excellent as well. infowarsstore.com.

[18:02.640 --> 18:08.080]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico,

[20:19.200 --> 20:47.680]  So, John Stewart, the God, the Lord, the King of the Democrats comes out and endorses
[20:47.680 --> 20:52.640]  Trump and Phoenix in front of a whole press conference almost a week ago, got no coverage
[20:52.640 --> 21:00.240]  except on Fox and Phoenix, and says, Trump has done a great job of the Justice Department,
[21:00.240 --> 21:04.320]  taking the hundreds of millions of dollars that both parties wouldn't give that was voted over
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.520]  a decade ago to the first responders, their families, those that died of cancer, those that
[21:09.520 --> 21:17.200]  had cancer from the World Trade Center attack, because they never wanted to admit it that
[21:17.200 --> 21:24.160]  Lower Manhattan got toxified, and Trump has turned that money loose, just like he's doubled
[21:24.160 --> 21:30.080]  the number of visits at the VA for veterans. It doesn't mean the VA's perfect, but Trump's
[21:30.080 --> 21:33.840]  really trying to fix the bureaucracy. And so, John Stewart comes out and says,
[21:33.840 --> 21:42.080]  Trump's done a great job, and it gets zero attention except for Breitbart and infowars.com
[21:42.080 --> 21:49.040]  and Fox News in Phoenix, even Fox News National that I know of didn't care it. Why? Because they're
[21:49.040 --> 21:53.440]  not going to attack John Stewart. They're just going to ignore John Stewart. Here's that clip.
[21:54.640 --> 21:57.840]  And I'm going to say this now, are the cameras on? Is everybody on me?
[21:57.840 --> 22:03.040]  The Trump Justice Department is doing an excellent job
[22:03.760 --> 22:10.000]  administrating this program. The claims are going through faster, and the awards are coming through.
[22:14.000 --> 22:20.960]  The Trump Justice Department, I don't know about anything else. I'm not going to comment on anything
[22:20.960 --> 22:25.600]  else. But see, that makes John Stewart, his brother is the head of the Dow Jones industrial
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.040]  average and very powerful. Makes John Stewart the high authority like he waves a wand. He tells you
[22:31.040 --> 22:37.360]  when Trump's good. But why is he doing it? Because all his peers and people around him
[22:37.360 --> 22:41.280]  know that Trump's trying to turn the US economy on. They know he's trying to do a better trade
[22:41.280 --> 22:46.080]  deal with China. They know globalism has been one-sided about selling America out,
[22:47.280 --> 22:53.520]  about conquering us, about bringing us to heel. So he understands where the tea leaves are,
[22:53.520 --> 22:56.160]  and he's starting to jump ship. Now let's move on to Van Jones.
[22:57.680 --> 23:01.840]  Van Jones is the big Black Lives Matter guy. Why he says when cops get shot, you know,
[23:01.840 --> 23:07.520]  it's their fault because they're racist. Van Jones is the guy caught peddling division in this nation,
[23:08.480 --> 23:12.240]  caught doing all sorts of evil things. So why would he suddenly go to CPAC
[23:14.400 --> 23:18.720]  and say that, well, it's Republican governors that are actually cutting prison populations
[23:18.720 --> 23:25.840]  in lowering crime by keeping hardened criminals and releasing nonviolent criminals. So the old
[23:25.840 --> 23:31.040]  model is fill up the prisons with lots of people, take nonviolence, turn them into violence by
[23:31.040 --> 23:35.760]  getting trained by hardened criminals. How about we just keep real hardened criminals, bank robbers,
[23:35.760 --> 23:41.280]  murs, child molesters, rapists, and let other people nonviolent go? Well, a bunch of Republican
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.560]  states have done that and they've lowered crime and they've lowered the prison population and
[23:46.560 --> 23:54.560]  they've saved money. So Van Jones comes out and says, wow, you've stolen, you've stolen my identity,
[23:54.560 --> 24:01.680]  you've stolen my position, you've stolen my issue. But wait, Van Jones, you're just an idiot. It was
[24:01.680 --> 24:06.000]  the Republicans that passed the Civil Rights Act. It was Republicans that always tried to do prison
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.440]  reform. It was the Clintons in 94 that got the crime bill passed that gave Blacks triple the
[24:11.440 --> 24:17.760]  sentence of whites and funded federalization of prisons to build all these prisons. So you're
[24:17.760 --> 24:22.880]  acting like, oh, Republicans have just gotten smart and they're just now doing the right thing. No,
[24:22.880 --> 24:28.880]  you're part of the KKK party. You're part of the party where Hillary said Blacks are animals that
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.360]  have to be brought to heel. Super predators, you're part of the party of the KKK. Doesn't mean
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.720]  Republicans haven't been blue bloods and established like the Bushes and gone along with it, but you
[24:40.720 --> 24:45.520]  don't sit up there when the Republicans do the right thing and then wave a wand and go, well,
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.520]  it's Christians and it's libertarians at the party. Yeah, you know who we are. We have a soul. We're
[24:51.520 --> 24:56.640]  not for sale. You're for sale. You're for the Democrats. And you know, Democrats are waking up
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.680]  so you want to come and act like you wave the wand and say, you Republicans are pretty good on this.
[25:01.680 --> 25:08.400]  We go, oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. When you never did anything to actually criticize who did it
[25:08.400 --> 25:15.120]  or what happened, you're on the tit of Hillary Clinton. You're in bed with her. Hell, it's in
[25:15.120 --> 25:19.360]  the WikiLeaks that she wants race war and racial division. And as soon as those orders went out four
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.160]  years ago, you went out and doubled down your racial crap. So here's why Van Jones is doing it.
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.680]  Van Jones has had his ass handed to him. He knows demographically, double the number of
[25:29.680 --> 25:34.800]  Blacks are voting Republican now, double the number of Hispanics. They're panicking. And he's
[25:34.800 --> 25:40.080]  saying to the Democrats, why the hell did you give up this issue? The Republicans have absolutely
[25:40.080 --> 25:46.640]  Spencer attacked us and are exposing us. What are you doing? And Hillary just thinks if they
[25:46.640 --> 25:51.200]  and Maxine waters and Pelosi, if they just intensify racial division, people will hear
[25:51.200 --> 25:55.280]  about race, race, race, race, race, and I'll actually see where people are getting screwed over.
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.400]  So it's a test of the minorities. I think you're smart. Trump thinks you're smart. Are you smart?
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.840]  Are white smart? Are real liberal smart enough to know that the racial games that have been played
[26:07.840 --> 26:13.840]  could come to an end if we want to do it? Here's Van Jones at CPAC. Here's the deal.
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.440]  The conservative movement in this country, unfortunately, from my point of view,
[26:22.320 --> 26:30.720]  is now the leader on this issue of reform in that you look at Mississippi, a rock, rib,
[26:30.720 --> 26:38.240]  a totally conservative former jailer is the governor there, Governor Bryant. Governor Bryant
[26:39.040 --> 26:46.720]  has cut the prison population and crime at the same time. Deal in Georgia, cut the prison
[26:46.720 --> 26:53.520]  population and crime at the same time. Rick Perry cut the prison population, prison expenditures
[26:53.520 --> 27:00.960]  and crime at the same time. Ohio, South Carolina, what you're seeing now are Republican governors
[27:00.960 --> 27:07.760]  being tough on the dollars, tough on crime and shrinking prison populations and showing the
[27:07.760 --> 27:12.320]  rest of the country that it can be done. Now, my problem is I now have a conservative movement
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.120]  that for libertarian reasons, for Christian conservative reasons and for fiscally conservative
[27:19.120 --> 27:25.360]  reasons, is actually doing a great job on what should be my issue. This is supposed to be my
[27:25.360 --> 27:41.760]  issue. You are stealing my issue. They're welcoming you. Look, I'm going to stay at my party.
[27:41.760 --> 27:50.160]  I'm going to stay at my party. But what I want to say, but take some dead gum credit for being
[27:50.160 --> 27:55.680]  smart. I've never seen a bird's fly with only a left wing. I've never seen a bird's fly with
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.440]  only a right wing, not even in Mississippi. We need each other. We need each other.
[28:00.480 --> 28:06.320]  So that's Van Jones realizing that he has no moral support for what he's done. He wants to act like
[28:06.320 --> 28:10.400]  he was actually fighting for all that when he was actually covering up for all that.
[28:10.400 --> 28:16.320]  And he realizes that he's being circumnavigated. He realizes he's being outflanked. And so now
[28:16.320 --> 28:21.360]  all he can do is ship it like a moral authority and go, you've done the right thing. But when he
[28:21.360 --> 28:26.960]  did that, everything from USA Today, the New York Times, the Washington Post said Van Jones is done.
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.840]  He's a racist. He's a white supremacist. The articles are up on infowars.com. That's the
[28:31.840 --> 28:35.760]  craziest. But let me tell you, the stuff we're seeing out of John Stewart, stuff we're seeing
[28:35.760 --> 28:41.440]  out of Van Jones is rats leaving the sinking ship. And it shows they understand what's happening.
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.520]  Trump's trying to end all these illegal wars. Democrats want them. Trump's trying to stop the
[28:45.520 --> 28:49.760]  child kidnapping and pedophile rings. Trump's trying to stop one side of trade deals. And the
[28:49.760 --> 28:56.080]  Democrats, because they're bought and paid for by farm powers, stand firmly against it. Firmly
[28:56.080 --> 29:04.960]  against it. Getting your protein has never been easier with infowars life protein bars

[34:20.160 --> 34:26.800]  of canada and this is all unified worldwide so it's coming here next saying the state will
[34:26.800 --> 34:32.640]  take your child if they're autistic or mentally retarded especially when the government convinces
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.320]  your kid at school that they're another sex they sign a piece of paper the age of consent's gone

[34:54.080 --> 35:01.520]  it's predatory our governments shot up people from canada to brazil with live syphilis that's who
[35:01.520 --> 35:07.040]  runs our governments criminals get in there they crave power and now they're going to come and
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.040]  they're going to they're going to fry them with hormones and they're going to chop their testicles
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.480]  off and you're going to love it and you're going to thank them for doing it and top olympian women
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.720]  are saying men are taking over all the sports and women's sports well they're getting in trouble those
[35:20.720 --> 35:28.480]  are women no they're not but it's the total societal takeover it's all up on info wars.com
[35:28.480 --> 35:36.880]  it's all about depopulation it's all about total control it's all smiley face leftist cult members
[35:36.880 --> 35:44.960]  who want your children and they will get them biological men are dominating women's sports
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.080]  here's a katlyn benet report at info wars.com
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.440]  chose men obviously with wigs meeting women at basketball
[35:57.440 --> 36:07.280]  what you just saw is the future that liberals want in women's sports so there's a huge problem
[36:07.280 --> 36:12.400]  in women's sports right now and it's all because of the ridiculous social justice agenda that has
[36:12.400 --> 36:17.040]  been shoved down our throats for the last five plus years we're told we have to accept things
[36:17.040 --> 36:22.400]  that you know aren't true like that this 41 year old man is actually a six year old girl
[36:22.400 --> 36:28.480]  or that this girl is actually a real cat we are told to abandon science and forget everything we
[36:28.480 --> 36:35.360]  know is true in regard men as women and women as men well now we have actual men beating actual
[36:35.360 --> 36:47.200]  women in their own sports and it's very progressive we make jokes of this some big guy running over
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.760]  girls in basketball it's been an issue for a few years now but you probably didn't know because
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.720]  why would the liberal mainstream media put out that their social justice feminism campaign
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.480]  backfired and now men are dominating women's sports that would be rather embarrassing for them
[37:02.480 --> 37:23.840]  in 2017 a male entered a wrestling tournament and when I say male I mean female and this is
[37:23.840 --> 37:30.400]  so confusing so let's step back for a second this female is taking testosterone to transition into a
[37:30.400 --> 37:36.800]  male but is still competing in women's wrestling she ended up winning the state title undefeated
[37:36.800 --> 37:42.480]  last year she did the exact same thing so basically a woman taking testosterone injections
[37:42.480 --> 37:47.920]  who demands to be called a boy just won a statewide wrestling title against other women
[37:47.920 --> 37:54.080]  for the second time in march 2017 a 39 year old male decided he was going to be a female
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.920]  and he won his first international women's weightlifting title all while breaking four
[37:59.920 --> 38:06.960]  national records in the process something tells me he couldn't win in men's sports so he had to go
[38:06.960 --> 38:14.880]  over to female sports i'm gonna win the woman's championship you're not even a woman what'd you
[38:14.880 --> 38:21.840]  say in october of 2018 a biological male became the first ever transgender world champion in a
[38:21.840 --> 38:30.400]  women's cycling event look at this photo that is obviously a dude come on just last week
[38:30.400 --> 38:35.120]  two biological men won first and second place at a girls track and field championship in
[38:35.120 --> 38:41.520]  Connecticut they took first and second place what's more alarming than this is that according to the
[38:41.520 --> 38:47.920]  gateway pundit Connecticut is one of 17 states that allows transgender athletes to compete without
[38:47.920 --> 38:53.520]  anytime i love the mental illness so that basically means they can just call themselves a female and
[38:53.520 --> 38:58.160]  be allowed to compete nothing has to change that's right total mental illness diamond surgery and
[38:58.160 --> 39:09.760]  let's do it hormonal treatments did you got to see the video of your radio listener stop on
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.920]  info wars dot com champions are you ready to lose it's the guy and the girl are about to race but
[39:15.920 --> 39:23.200]  he's got a big wig on so it's okay oh no you're not biological men are dominating women's sports
[39:23.200 --> 39:34.640]  in full wars dot com i've been a woman for two days what a champion to win the championship
[39:34.640 --> 39:42.240]  in Connecticut then had the nerve to suggest that girls have an advantage over him so instead of
[39:42.240 --> 39:48.640]  these two men competing against boys they magically get to call themselves girls and win championships
[39:51.600 --> 39:58.960]  it's ma'am feminists should be outraged over this because instead of empowering female athletes
[39:58.960 --> 40:05.440]  two boys are stolen girls championship from actual females this can only mean that one day
[40:05.440 --> 40:10.320]  they will be taking scholarships from them too thankfully some female athletes are starting
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.000]  to speak out one of the girls who just lost to these men to Laura Ingram that it's very frustrating
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.960]  she said we are not physically able to be competitive against someone who is biologically
[40:20.960 --> 40:27.840]  a male duh in fact she admitted that everyone in the race already expected to lose to these two men
[40:28.400 --> 40:33.840]  the girl said well we all know the outcome of the race before it even starts it's demoralizing
[40:33.840 --> 40:40.720]  this is simple science men have higher bone density larger muscles and higher testosterone
[40:40.720 --> 40:47.200]  levels men are different than females that's why they were the hunters they were the caretakers
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.080]  and they're the providers and a family if you thought it would stop there you're dead wrong
[40:52.720 --> 40:58.320]  now the olympics is trying to allow men to compete in women's sports and prior olympics
[40:58.320 --> 41:04.160]  transgendered athletes were able to compete if they had gender reassignment surgery and underwent
[41:04.160 --> 41:09.680]  two years of hormone replacement therapy as if chopping off your ding dong suddenly makes you
[41:09.680 --> 41:15.440]  a woman but now under their new proposed rules they will be able to compete after just one year
[41:15.440 --> 41:22.640]  of hormone replacement therapy and without having to have surgery this means that literal men with
[41:22.640 --> 41:32.160]  wieners still swinging between their legs will be able to compete against women at the olympics
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.920]  the total breakdown of society by design i can only imagine how many failed athletes who have
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.640]  aspired to become olympians would not call themselves female for a year just so they can
[41:42.640 --> 41:48.640]  live out their dreams not good and it's very progressive these people are less than 0.6 of
[41:48.640 --> 41:54.880]  the population in america yet 100 of america's population is supposed to succumb to their rules
[41:54.880 --> 42:02.000]  their truths and their demands leftists you wanted this and now it's time to own up to it you don't
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.400]  care about women and if you claim you do you will fix this otherwise it's only a matter of time until
[42:08.400 --> 42:14.080]  lebron jeans actually comes out like this for real so we can finally get as many championship rings
[42:14.080 --> 42:21.760]  as michael jordan but see we say it's up to them to fix it they create the crisis to offer the
[42:21.760 --> 42:29.440]  solution this is a plan to wreck the family just like aoc says stop having kids don't have kids we
[42:29.440 --> 42:36.560]  can't kill your babies in the womb we're going to make them autistic with chemicals out of the womb
[42:36.560 --> 42:43.040]  and then sterilize them it's about sterilizing people it's about depopulation it's about sabotaging
[42:43.040 --> 42:48.000]  culture it's in the whiskey leaks it's their plan and if we won't protect our children from these
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.960]  monsters we won't do anything they've got the governor of virginia saying let's kill babies
[42:52.960 --> 42:58.960]  after they're born and new york passed the law they want to murder your children they want to kill
[42:58.960 --> 43:04.080]  them the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[43:04.080 --> 43:09.440]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[43:09.440 --> 43:15.120]  dumbs the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[43:15.120 --> 43:21.200]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[43:21.200 --> 43:25.680]  but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[43:25.680 --> 43:31.760]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now due to
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.720]  the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth
[43:36.720 --> 43:42.640]  crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[43:42.640 --> 43:49.200]  it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it

[47:10.400 --> 47:40.240]  why do you think california would pass a law that if you miss gendered
[47:40.240 --> 47:46.000]  someone some guy looks like a linebacker walks in he has a pink shirt on so you say what would
[47:46.000 --> 47:54.800]  you like buddy it's ma'am i'm gonna kick your ass it's ma'am it's ma'am coming through the wall
[47:54.800 --> 48:07.920]  that acts and the shining it's ma'am hello it's jimmy karson johnny karson this is all
[48:07.920 --> 48:14.880]  part of the plan show that when they've got human animal hybrids and their armors and babies
[48:14.880 --> 48:22.080]  organs and they've got new humanoids that have three fathers and three mothers and all these new
[48:22.080 --> 48:29.600]  weird things they're designing that you accept it all because you were taught in 2015 16 17 18 19
[48:29.600 --> 48:35.760]  that the word mother and father was bad and and that you could have men taking over the olympics
[48:35.760 --> 48:44.800]  all the different uh the high jump the long jump the hundred yard the mile and and and it's like
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.040]  but they're women they say they are and so all these new humanoids they're going to dump out
[48:49.040 --> 48:53.840]  why they're human too and oh they're saying robots are going to have rights and ai is going to have
[48:53.840 --> 49:01.680]  rights you're all being taught to be replaced you're all being taught you have no basic freedoms
[49:01.680 --> 49:07.520]  you're being taught you have no free speech the existing order is being overthrown by mega corporations
[49:09.520 --> 49:15.360]  the just like monsanto created the terminator genes and the terminator seeds where the seeds
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.920]  don't produce more plants later they work one time and that's it you got to go back to monsanto to get
[49:19.920 --> 49:25.600]  it and that's where we're going with humans where we're totally sterilized dehumanized poisoned and
[49:25.600 --> 49:31.920]  attacked but if we give up our humanity to big tech to big pharma to big genetic engineering
[49:31.920 --> 49:38.720]  they can fix all the problems they're engineering that's the takeover plan and we're so confused
[49:38.720 --> 49:43.440]  that all our kids are taught you're a boy you could be a girl you're a girl you could be a boy be
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.480]  loving let the government teach your kids they're another sex let the government take your kids away
[49:48.480 --> 49:54.320]  and sterilize them like the supreme court of canada just ruled the father says i think my
[49:54.320 --> 49:57.920]  daughter's mentally ill i don't want the state to take my underage daughter and sterilize her
[49:57.920 --> 50:03.680]  you tell her that she's not a boy one time you're arrested the imagine if some pervert told your
[50:03.680 --> 50:10.480]  daughter that but it's the state so it's okay the same state bringing in radical islam and doing all
[50:10.480 --> 50:18.480]  of this so that's the reality this is the takeover because they know we don't want communism they
[50:18.480 --> 50:22.800]  know we don't want pedophilia when they know we don't want socialism they know we don't want what
[50:22.800 --> 50:27.680]  they're putting on us so they make it illegal and they shovel it in our face and they say the most
[50:27.680 --> 50:33.680]  radical sickening evil things but the governor of virginia going i believe we should pass the law
[50:33.680 --> 50:41.520]  new york did we keep the baby alive we do we want with this and it's good after it's bold
[50:43.600 --> 50:47.200]  because they're already keeping them alive and they've been caught so now they gotta normalize
[50:47.200 --> 50:52.880]  and go of course we keep them alive but i want to shift gears here
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.600]  and i've got some solutions next hour and laura lumar thrown out of c pack for talking to oliver
[51:01.600 --> 51:06.880]  darcy the cnn censor he's just a royal god you don't even talk to him the republicans bow
[51:10.640 --> 51:15.200]  because they're the republican establishment they all come out of the same swamp that worships
[51:15.200 --> 51:21.920]  authority and the system but let's go to this mark dice report on millie weaver info wars.com
[51:21.920 --> 51:27.520]  reporter and the long hour-long interview with ryan stelter but it tells you so much to the
[51:27.520 --> 51:33.680]  interview i've got several coming up not just this one who's like you know i'm really busy
[51:33.680 --> 51:38.240]  but i can talk to you for a minute but you know we only ban people off my twitter who're trying to
[51:38.240 --> 51:46.240]  get famous off of me and it's such a telltale thing he says as if he's the arbiter of who's famous
[51:46.240 --> 51:53.920]  he's the arbiter his show on the weekend doesn't have 200 000 viewers he is a total failure a new
[51:53.920 --> 52:03.920]  york times propagandist a fake news king universally reviled has no viewers worse ratings on cnn
[52:03.920 --> 52:09.680]  and he claims mark dice who has videos with 20 million views 30 million views average video
[52:09.680 --> 52:16.240]  half million views does four or five videos a day that mark dice a media analyst a degree journalist
[52:16.240 --> 52:23.920]  in your system that mark dice you blocked him on twitter because he wanted your fame no he was
[52:23.920 --> 52:29.520]  debating you with dis info and how you were calling for me to be banned and so he said hey i
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.160]  challenge you but because there's a man you're not a man and you couldn't deal with that challenge
[52:35.840 --> 52:40.960]  and as you said alex jones is a virus and a disease that must be banned when someone
[52:40.960 --> 52:49.040]  challenged you on that you say oh i only blocked mark dice because he wanted my fame
[52:51.920 --> 52:56.800]  no you want everyone else shut down so you think then you'll get fame no one likes you brian
[52:56.800 --> 53:04.080]  you're a little delusional fop a fraud you're a little red tie up in front of a bunch of leftist
[53:04.080 --> 53:10.960]  lobotomized zombies trying to act cool here he is well cnn's brian stelter tried his hand at stand
[53:10.960 --> 53:18.320]  up comedy the other day he gave a lecture at kent state university on media ethics this is a guy
[53:18.320 --> 53:24.880]  whose weekend show is called reliable sources after his lecture was over millie weaver a lovely
[53:24.880 --> 53:31.920]  reporter for info wars dot com decided to ask him some questions hey brian okay so why did you block
[53:31.920 --> 53:41.280]  mark dice on twitter uh first of all hey thank you for asking questions illy weaver brian yeah um
[53:41.280 --> 53:44.800]  they're gonna kick us out a couple minutes but i'm happy to okay sure but i do want to add everybody
[53:44.800 --> 53:50.800]  else too yeah you can't get close oh thank you mr my viewers for your show thank you so why did you
[53:50.800 --> 53:57.280]  do some time so uh sometimes i block people because they're trying to gain fame and stacker
[53:58.160 --> 54:04.000]  just by making silly jokes and attacks so it's not worth it he already has a big following though
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.280]  yeah i'd say it's you know he's okay i think his videos are funny you think he's you like his parents
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.680]  of you i've only watched a couple but they're pretty funny yeah okay so look at how uncomfortable
[54:13.680 --> 54:18.800]  he is millie you're gonna give the poor guy nightmares about me brian if you think my voice
[54:18.800 --> 54:25.120]  over is if you are funny then why did you block me you need to man up bro and get a sense of humor
[54:25.120 --> 54:30.480]  sounds to me like you're jealous that i'm just one guy at a laptop in my kitchen who's getting a
[54:30.480 --> 54:37.040]  quarter of the viewers of cnn's prime time shows millie went on to ask him why if he supports the
[54:37.040 --> 54:43.200]  first amendment and the rights of journalists would cnn lobby the social media companies
[54:43.200 --> 54:49.680]  to get them to ban alex joe's do you think that twitter should unban alex jones hitting powers
[54:50.880 --> 54:56.160]  i don't know uh i think it's a really complicated subject i'm not sure what the right answer is
[54:56.160 --> 55:01.840]  journalism though aren't you again censorship how is your what if that slippery slope when it gets
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.120]  to you where i first of all i love your photos uh i think it's very smart but you built up for
[55:07.120 --> 55:11.680]  viral following what about the question i enjoy the question what if that slippery slope when it gets
[55:11.680 --> 55:16.400]  to you what if you were the thing but that's why i said i don't i don't have a really good i don't
[55:16.400 --> 55:21.520]  know very good uh if facebook is the right thing or not that's not for me to decide that's for
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.560]  facebook that's for facebook cnn has called for some social media sites to crack down on infowars
[55:26.560 --> 55:32.320]  and now cnn has not called for that they have cnn has asked so i think what all over did that was
[55:32.320 --> 55:38.800]  so smart was he just asked a really simple question do these pages violate your misinformation
[55:38.800 --> 55:44.240]  about and so that's actually facebook's responsibility not cnn what a snake i think what
[55:44.240 --> 55:50.080]  oliver darshy did was really smart oliver darshy's the weasel who literally led the campaign to
[55:50.080 --> 55:56.080]  pressure the social media companies to ban alex jones by constantly tattling on him for what he
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.280]  was posting things got even worse for brian when he was asked why he blocked me on twitter again
[56:01.840 --> 56:08.080]  this time by katlyn benet she's the girl whose graduation photo from ken state went viral
[56:08.080 --> 56:13.920]  because she was posing with an ar-15 do you uh do you get mad at mark dice often robert
[56:13.920 --> 56:20.320]  moeller was that do you get mad at mark dice often i don't why'd you block him so so i and then
[56:20.320 --> 56:26.800]  complained to jack the ceo of twitter that he was bullying you not only is she asking him about why
[56:26.800 --> 56:32.080]  he blocked me on twitter but she's sticking an infowars microphone right in his face he's gonna
[56:32.080 --> 56:37.360]  cry himself to sleep tonight for sure if you want to say one thing to mark dice what would it be i
[56:37.360 --> 56:41.920]  don't know mark dice so you don't know who mark dice is i didn't say that i said i don't know mark
[56:41.920 --> 56:47.120]  dice personally if you had to say one thing to um what would it be so again very clever stunt
[56:47.120 --> 56:52.720]  i love the game i think you're very good at the game uh so i respect the player uh i also respect
[56:52.720 --> 56:57.760]  his funny videos i've watched a couple of them i'm sure he'll dub this one also it's funny it's
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.880]  not journalism i don't care much about it but it's funny what i do is not journalism i happen to
[57:02.880 --> 57:07.360]  have a bachelor's degree in communication from california state university i'm a credentialed

[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:21.360]  you know here's why i'm so frustrated it's in their textbooks it's in their own documents
[1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:26.560]  we've got a scientific elite funded by big corporations that wants to unify the planet
[1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:32.640]  under corporate control and who wants to literally end the family so humans are just these atomized
[1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:40.080]  biological androids fully controlled by these control freaks and i want to get into a whole
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:47.520]  host of issues i haven't hit yet the ties into the dnc says attempted cyber attack wasn't russia
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:52.640]  it was a test from michigan and i noticed this just happened again the last month it happened
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:58.400]  again last year got no attention i'll tell you about the start of the next segment yeah that's
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:02.560]  the article from last year i've got another one here but right now
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:12.160]  i want to go ahead and go to this tucker carlson talks about paypal banning laura lumar how dangerous
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:17.920]  is this that for your political views you've got good credit but they take your banking away
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:22.560]  this is the mark of the beast this is the control and if trump doesn't do something about this
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.680]  then nothing else he does matters here it is
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:32.080]  act of the platforming is ruining people's lives i have been banned by uber i've been banned by
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:37.280]  lyft i've been temporarily banned by facebook thenmo paypal nine percent of my income came
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:42.800]  through paypal i've been banned that go from me um if you want to make money online and many people
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:48.640]  do paypal is essential in a recent interview with the wall street journal the ceo of paypal
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:54.800]  dan schulman explained that diversity and inclusion are his company's top values but of
[1:01:54.800 --> 1:02:00.640]  course he doesn't mean it he means the opposite like most on the left what schulman actually
[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:07.360]  wants is utter conformity a world where only approved opinions are allowed last year paypal
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:12.160]  banned alex jones from using its platform for saying things they didn't like they've also banned
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:18.240]  anti muslim activist laura lumar the publication v dare and a number of other people and organizations
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:23.200]  whose speech they believe should be silenced like how would you feel if somebody shut off your
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:31.440]  paypal or your paypal or your twitter so we're facing real authoritarianism we're facing governments
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:40.000]  that are unified it's the same in germany canada the u.s england the netherlands we're going to
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.600]  teach your kids they're another sex we're going to take them from you and drug them and chop their
[1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:50.480]  balls off or inject them with testosterone so instead of hiding giving people syphilis like
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:56.480]  tuskegee we're just going to do it out in the open and we're going to do it like it's the
[1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:02.160]  socially right thing to do and we're going to punish you if you don't socially do the right
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:12.320]  thing and follow along with what the establishment wants you know of america and the world puts up
[1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:23.840]  with this we deserve what we get because i'll tell you it's a paradox an industrial society
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:31.760]  creates a very cushy living but it also fosters a lot of weakness mental weakness
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:37.200]  moral weakness and i'm certainly i'm not on a high horse here but i
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:43.360]  i sometimes get why the bible talks about god just blowing the whole planet up getting rid
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:48.480]  of everybody because we shouldn't keep a world going where we abort most our kids and we devil
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:54.320]  worship and we let people molest kids in mass and it's state runs so kids are only born to be abused
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:04:00.960]  by devil worshipers and and and life is only there for psychotics to enjoy it just end it all then
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:07.200]  blow it all up burn it all up get rid of it now i don't think we're to that point yet
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:15.760]  but i just see people that are only into personal pleasure and look i enjoy enchiladas or a cold
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:20.720]  beer next next person's as much but it's not my god it doesn't fulfill me at the end of the day
[1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:27.360]  and all these people that just bow down to their own personal pleasure and fill in their calendar
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:31.920]  every day with what they think is good for them they are soulless i know these people
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:38.800]  there's nothing there they're like retarded in a bad way and i just have made the decision
[1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:44.560]  that i'm not going to be around soulless empty people anymore i want you out of my life all of
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:52.400]  you you hollywood peacocks all of you i want you to get out of my way i don't want to be around you
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:05:00.880]  i don't like you and i hope you die die you know the worst part about getting old and i'm still
[1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:05.120]  strong at 45 is that i won't be there for my children someday that's why i need to make them
[1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:11.120]  strong now now i can be there for my children now i can make them strong now i can instruct them
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:15.120]  now i can teach them what i've learned but not once i'm gone you think of this digital age your
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:18.960]  words going forever but now they're using better getting rid of what you said they were before
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:24.320]  it's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning
[1:05:24.320 --> 1:05:30.800]  isn't it but i have joined my will to the resistance i can't be destroyed now as long as i realize
[1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:34.800]  i've done right and the long as the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed either as
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:40.640]  long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it there is a
[1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:46.160]  magic that then takes place the transcend space and time when you commit be a word of mouth or to
[1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.760]  pray for us or to spread our articles and videos that overrides everything the enemy's doing so
[1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:57.360]  please now commit to support info wars however you can and realize your provision to info wars is your
[1:05:57.360 --> 1:05:58.320]  own provision
[1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:14.640]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:25.600]  you know there was a big educational process that happened last wednesday
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:32.720]  okay joe rogan undoubtedly the biggest podcast the world is regular shows reach about 10 million
[1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:40.720]  people he had me on and immediately youtube would not allow it to be shared youtube blocked it from
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:45.920]  the front page despite that it's got like seven and a half million views on youtube about 15 million
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:50.640]  views on itunes other platforms that are five million so we're talking about we're talking
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:56.480]  about already one of the top podcast uh that joe has ever done we're already talking about that
[1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:04.080]  but it just shows how the system doesn't know what to do or how to handle that
[1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:11.040]  because people are hungry for real discussion and people that don't have filters so that's coming
[1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:15.120]  up next segment ahead of laura lumar we're gonna play some of those segments and talk about it
[1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:23.520]  but it was number one on google number one on youtube but it was blocked in both now last
[1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:29.120]  time i was on joe two years ago it was blocked on itunes they didn't block it there four or five
[1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:35.040]  days later it's number one 15 million views whatever it is it's growing that's just on one
[1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:42.800]  platform number one despite suppression and the suppressed four hour plus podcast is on info wars
[1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:49.200]  dot com and news wars dot com go here what they don't want you to know and the full system what the
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:55.680]  elites believe not not not what they put out on the news but what they believe at the end of the
[1:07:55.680 --> 1:08:05.280]  day what they're involved in and you're gonna find out i'll get into that next segment the
[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:12.000]  laura lumar joins us and i want to tie it into federal government extends contracts to make human
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:18.480]  animal hybrids that's mainstream news see suddenly it's just kind of like yo okay they got the human
[1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:24.080]  animal hybrids we'll show them to us what are you doing with them see they don't want that debate
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.520]  and all i've ever done is believed in you and believe that if we had a debate
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.320]  about what's already been going on for a long time you'd know
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:41.200]  and that's why i get so pissed is i'm not mad at the crew or you or the audience
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:46.160]  i'm kind of sick of this you know what i mean i've been doing this 23 years 24 years i'm so
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:51.440]  sick of knowing what the globalists are doing and how to beat them and then sitting back and
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:56.080]  watching people like they have had their eyeballs gouged out and their and their
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:02.880]  eardrums gouged out not seeing or hearing or tasting or smelling or touching when it's all
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:09.120]  completely obvious there's an anti-human anti god anti-family agenda going on that is screwing
[1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:13.680]  everyone over we're under total attack by psychotics that run major institutions
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:20.080]  and now they're literally trying to end the family itself to conquer us and we're putting up with it
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:28.000]  but there's a lot of good news too so i should be more positive
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:35.760]  so let's go ahead and play a few minutes of Tucker Carlson before he got Donald Trump Jr on
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:41.360]  last week and where they said the whole 20-minute interview the cavalry's coming Trump knows
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:46.240]  conservatives are being censored we're going to do something well at least you know people are pissed
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:51.040]  so that that's Trump trying to get people out there watching understand he's going to do something
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:56.000]  good because you know the president can declare an emergency on the border that's in the constitution
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:01.840]  i can't believe rand paul says he can or justin amash trying to get points with the media but see
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:07.920]  Trump shouldn't try to do it through the 76 law because then you can debate congress' funding
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:14.000]  under an emergency the president's job is the border and so i agree with constitutional lawyer
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:21.200]  Stuart Rhodes that he shows just gone straight up with the constitution instead of a law but that's
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:25.200]  how his lawyer's tricking and it's the only way he can be beaten on that but to say the president
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.760]  can't defend the border from invasion that's unconstitutional well then the whole country's
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:36.080]  unconstitutional here's Tucker Carlson on the attack on the first amendment there are some
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:40.960]  negative things that you could say about donald trump what's interesting is that the left almost
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:46.880]  never says them and said they spend a lot of time telling you how trump is a fascist who poses
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:54.240]  an imminent and terrifying threat to our constitutional order it sounds pretty scary is it true well
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:58.880]  consider the major freedoms protected by our bill of rights the document that makes america
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.920]  distinct from all other countries freedom of speech freedom of worship the right to keep and
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:10.960]  bear arms due process under the law now take a close look at today's news who exactly is
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:18.240]  threatening those freedoms is it donald trump whatever his faults it is not donald trump
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:23.120]  it is the left and they are doing it more aggressively than they ever have before as
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:29.120]  usual their critique of trump is pure projection if you want to know what the left is actually
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:36.240]  doing listen to the way they attack other people start with a foundational freedom speech if they
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:41.120]  can tell you what to say you are not free there is nothing they can't make you do that's what the
[1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:47.360]  founders put it first it's the freedom that comes before all others the left has spent decades trying
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.880]  to weaken the first amendment they've done it in the sneakiest way possible by creating phony
[1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:58.800]  hate speech exemptions out of thin air so far the course i've not accepted this idea that the idea
[1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:03.840]  that you can limit speech should be because someone else doesn't like it so the left has a new plan
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:09.840]  now they've allied with big corporations to make it impossible for people who say the wrong things
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:15.280]  to make a living in this country you may have heard of a company called paypal it's an online
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:22.080]  payment platform the biggest if you want to make money online and many people do paypal is essential
[1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:27.200]  in a recent interview with the wall street journal the ceo of paypal dan schulman explained that
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:33.520]  diversity and inclusion are his company's top values but of course he doesn't mean it he means
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:40.160]  the opposite like most on the left what schulman actually wants is utter conformity a world where
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:46.400]  only approved opinions are allowed last year paypal banned alex jones from using its platform for
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:51.680]  saying things they didn't like they've also banned anti muslim activist laura lumar the publication
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:57.360]  v dare and a number of other people and organizations whose speech they believe should be silenced
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:03.520]  schulman admitted that his company takes guidance on who to ban from the southern poverty law center
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:08.080]  that's an entirely fraudulent organization that works as an arm of the democratic national committee
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:15.200]  and then he got don jr on to say we know this is wrong the cavalry are coming well here's the deal
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:22.000]  we have under commerce clauses we have it under recitering clauses we have it under anti trust
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.480]  clauses it's cut and dry that the democrats are publicly organized harassing and attacking and
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:38.560]  shooing and shutting down all their competition in coordinated operations so i love a lot of
[1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:44.000]  what trump's doing but the first amendment comes first and you know this is an important phone
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:50.400]  call a few hours ago i think the white house knows how pissed people are but if trump doesn't act on
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:56.880]  this it's like blowing holes in the bottom of your own boat they have the sails up you may have a
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:01.680]  whole crew you may have a beautiful ship but if you let somebody drill a hole in the bottom of the
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:06.400]  boat i'm getting off the boat that means i don't love the captor and love the ship but you're going
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:12.720]  to the bottom i'm getting the hell off the ship we're gonna go to break here in a moment i've got
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:18.320]  some really good news though it was like six seven years ago we knew that iodine was key and that if
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:23.680]  you didn't have it people's IQs went down all these problems and the globals were bombarding us with
[1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:29.200]  chlorine and fluoride and the bad halogens and the good halogen is clean iodine but nobody had
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:35.680]  real atomic iodine we got supposed atomic iodine and tested it from companies and it wasn't i'm like
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.160]  a it's not what they say it is b we're going to get tested we're under the microscope this is not
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:45.200]  atomic iodine we're going to get sued so i found a seaweed company that had been around for 50 years
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:51.600]  or so that did have something you'd call atomic but it was extracted it was weak then we got deep
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:57.440]  earth crystal from drilling for oil and gas between seven and 12 000 feet we had that for five years
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.840]  became the number one bestseller in the world for iodine everyone loved it and then i got put over
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:07.040]  a barrel and the last year couldn't get it but i finally got them to break when i broke the contract
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:12.960]  and didn't have it for uh over a year and then it's been sold out for three months x2 is back

[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:24.320]  there's a lot of media in the world there's a lot of talk show hosts on a radio host on a tv
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:36.160]  host countries like india china lussia mexico germany united states over and over again the 20
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:42.240]  plus years i've been on air we hit the zeitgeist we haven't just had the number one video once or
[1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:50.080]  twice or 50 times or 100 times we've had the number one video thousands of times and we've
[1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:57.520]  always watched them block it yes the masses see it yes it gets 20 million views 30 million views
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:04.720]  100 million views 200 million views but it's never recognized the super bowl has like 80
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:11.360]  million views and it's just worshiped and people pay 10 million 15 million dollars for a 60 second
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:18.160]  ad it's just it's just everyone just even though their viewerships down 40 percent
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:24.400]  because of all the globalism and let this garbage so when i get up here and i say well
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:31.440]  look how info wars continues to dominate it's not like oh i'm a really cool guy ladies you need to
[1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:38.240]  know i'm the guy you want to be with it's not that it's not that i'm that good it's that humans
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:46.480]  have a serious hunger and a will and a desire to hear real communication that's a pro human narrative
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:50.240]  and not some corporate predatory thing that's been cooked up so
[1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:58.320]  we've always been shadow banned and blocked on youtube but despite that with all our channels
[1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:03.520]  combined we had like seven billion views when they banned us last year like 11 months ago
[1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:11.120]  and to me it's not like oh look pootie pie has 80 billion views i'm not as good as him
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:17.360]  young kids like to watch me play video games he's a great guy i kind of like wish he'd be pure liberty
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:21.600]  and speak the truth because we could maybe save the planet but it's like oh i'm mad pootie pie's
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:26.560]  bigger than me but in this panopticon there are things bigger than info wars but when it comes
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:32.720]  to hardcore news and analysis on real issues there's nothing bigger i mean you look at a
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:39.680]  wall street journal or a national review they don't even register to us they're the supposed
[1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:45.040]  intelligentsia of the right wing establishment they don't even register because they're leftist
[1:22:45.040 --> 1:22:51.280]  globalist blood blood control we're way up here so their censorship project drives us down to here
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:57.280]  but it creates that feedback loop of oh this tries and effect so we really go way up here
[1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:04.560]  but it's not about how big i am i just don't want to keep babies alive and sell their organs
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:10.880]  i i just don't want to you know have human animal hybrids the chai comes be our bosses
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:17.280]  i'm not like trying to like someday i'll be the number one talk show host someday i'll
[1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:24.400]  i'll be in charge i'll be in i don't want to be in charge i want to be in charge of getting
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:30.480]  those in charge out of the way to turn you loose but if you look at these numbers when i was on
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:38.880]  joe rougam who never had me on in his first 910 episodes had me on it was the biggest episode
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:42.560]  he ever did even though it was shadow band yeah zoom in on this zoom in right there
[1:23:45.280 --> 1:23:50.240]  and whatever reason joe did that whatever it doesn't matter so then joe has me on two years
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:24:01.200]  plus later so the 9 11 episode it's the 1 255 episode and it goes out of all the history of
[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:08.800]  his episodes a lot of these have been up for years it goes to number one that's over i talked
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:13.760]  to him a few days ago was it's 11 million who knows 15 20 million who knows what's that out of all
[1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:21.280]  his podcasts it's number one in history not elon musk tonight in these other people it's number one
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:31.840]  10 plus billion views alex jones now you go to the front page of itunes it's not even listed
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:38.240]  they don't show it and it's the same thing
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:52.320]  with youtube top podcast episode for all of apple for the entire week it's alex jones returns
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:59.520]  when he sent this to me it was over 10 million views that was three days ago
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:07.760]  now youtube has all these top trending videos some of them a couple hundred thousand views
[1:25:07.760 --> 1:25:14.560]  a few million views we're at seven plus million no coverage not anywhere on trending again it's
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:18.960]  rigged it's not a really won the race it's not who won the boxing match it's not who delivered
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:22.000]  it's a fraud
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:29.200]  and then nowhere else is it listed so what does that tell you
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:39.120]  we deliver an information warfare product based on pro human guts
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:45.280]  i mean why would it be that way it's not like we're doing something special i mean i'm a human
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:50.000]  i love my ancestors i love you i want to build something good it's not like we're doing something
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:55.120]  special don't thank us for this but somebody stands up and talks about facts and it's always
[1:25:55.120 --> 1:26:02.160]  number one not once not twice not three times not four times not five times not ten times thousands
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:10.400]  of times we've been number one humanity wants men and women and families and third dimensional
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:18.160]  resource expansion and a pro human future and we're reaching to the stars people want victory
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:26.640]  they want success and we're told by hollywood and all the losers no you're going to be forced
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:32.080]  fed all this stuff you're going to be forced fed all these anti-human anti-male anti-family
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:37.120]  anti-female talk show hosts we're going to take the stars off netflix because people are down voting
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:44.240]  it the good news is humanity is rejecting this the bad news is and here's where you play violence
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:50.960]  for real they can't get women they can't get men they can't get Hispanics they can't get blacks they
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:58.480]  can't get whites they can't get Asians but you know they can get children they've not differentiated
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:04.160]  the universe they believe any adult is an authority figure and all over the world they're teaching
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:10.480]  two-year-old kids you're a girl you're a boy let me sexualize you let me confuse you let me make
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:14.720]  you cool let me praise you in front of the class because you're a five-year-old boy you put on
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:21.600]  his rest and you want to have your peepee cut off it's classic villains that target children
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:28.880]  it's classic villains that target the young because they can't beat up a woman or a man
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:35.520]  they can't take on somebody that's differentiated and who has contact with their ancestors
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:42.000]  but they can take a baby that's why satanists do that and they can have their way with them
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:50.720]  and so i want you all to think about that today and where we stand our message dominates with adults
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:55.520]  it dominates with people that have jobs that have lived lives and
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:00.080]  no matter what color you are but if you've been in the real world and and and ran a company or
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:04.080]  worked at a company or drove a cab or been in the military and seen the real world you hear this
[1:28:04.080 --> 1:28:08.560]  you go yeah that's that's what i've already experienced that's true but they got our kids
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:14.720]  and they don't know so we got to ask ourselves what are we gonna do to get these hyenas these
[1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:22.320]  wolves off our kids asses we're gonna come back with Laura Loomer who scares the system
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:26.480]  bandit c pack because the southern primary law center said so straight ahead but make no mistake

[1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:40.000]  and god's gonna bring us low god's gonna tear us limb from limb and you know what we deserve it
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:45.360]  because we knew and didn't do anything god is going to hate us worse than the devil
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:51.360]  if we don't stand up for the unborn and the children because god expects you from the devil
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:55.440]  what does god expect from us that are out of the devil action

[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:19.600]  when they were doing shakespeare in the park in new york a few years ago
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:25.040]  simulating the murderer president trump was laura loomer took it over and got tens of millions of
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:31.040]  years and got arrested and she did it over and over and over again and so many things i can't
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:37.760]  list all her exploits and then she went to c pack and she was there on the southern property law
[1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:42.800]  center that runs a right wing watch said how dare you if she's so polite in the video the full
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:48.080]  video is on info wars.com we got 20 months left i'm not going to air it here it's on info wars.com
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:54.880]  she politely talks to oliver darcy the guy that i got banned off twitter they say because i bullied
[1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:59.120]  him i'm in a congressional hearing he's there he's calling for you banned i say how dare you
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:05.840]  you're an unamerican and they said you're banned because of that well she's there and she's kicked
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:11.120]  out because of that so i thought we should plug the video just so you can see it and she's a top
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:16.800]  story on the right hand side of regiport.com the disruptor laura loomer kicked out of c pack but
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:22.800]  we'll get to the rest of the story in a moment but here she is you're simply asking questions
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:30.160]  let's show her when they actually throw her out of c pack someone that as she says donald trump
[1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:35.600]  donald junior all of them retweet her doesn't matter the democrats are in control the southern
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:43.920]  property law center runs right wing watch and just like fox news i talked to top fox news host i won't
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:49.280]  say names but the top two but the top three they go yeah it's all democrats here they hate us they
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:57.360]  run everything they they they it's a nightmare and so the republican party trump tries to do good
[1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:02.720]  stuff but it's all run by democrats so here's that clip this just just happened yesterday
[1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:09.360]  so just so everyone knows they're banning me right now from c pack i'm here at the security
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:15.360]  and i'm one of trump's biggest supporters i have 265 000 followers on twitter before i was banned
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:20.720]  and you know i just talked to don jr the other day don jr follows me on instagram kimberley
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:26.560]  guilfoyle follows me on instagram i just had dinner with katrina pierce in last night who's the
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:32.800]  senior advisor to president trump and they are now banning me from c pack they're taking away my
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:36.560]  media credentials any reason why they're taking away my media credentials can you just provide a
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:41.920]  reason i've already explained that to you ma'am apparently somebody from c pack doesn't want me
[1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:48.480]  attending so you see laura lumar illuminate media c pack 2019 media credentials
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:55.120]  i'm banned on twitter banned on uber banned on paypal banned on uber eats lift go fund me everywhere
[1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:01.520]  and now they're banning me from c pack so i mean i'm one of president trump's biggest supporters
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:08.240]  i think the the the politics are irrelevant for it doesn't make any sense i'm i just had dinner
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.400]  with uh his senior advisor last night katrina pierce and why would they ban me from c pack that
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:18.240]  you you have this is such bad optics this is such bad optics for c pack to be banning me all right
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:25.040]  go ahead and pay it out let's go to laura so again trump everybody's good but the controllers
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:30.800]  are there ordering you removed because i'm not going to play the whole clip this is like 10
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:35.920]  minutes oliver darcy you just politely questioned him they admit that's why you were banned so
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:42.800]  uh laura lumar this is an example how the republicans bow down to the southern prairie law center
[1:37:46.240 --> 1:37:50.480]  hi alex thanks so much for having me yeah i know it's it's definitely deserving and it just
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:58.000]  reveals the real rhino nature and mentality of c pack in their leadership uh because not only was i uh
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.520]  i banned and i had my media credentials revoked as i was uh waiting through uh the line at security
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:09.120]  to go see president trump speak on the last day of c pack but i also wasn't the only conservative
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:15.520]  ban from c pack uh there were many uh prominent conservative individuals including um faith goldie
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:20.560]  and nicholas wentis and several other people including uh correspondence from info wars
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:26.800]  who were not allowed to enter associates of roger stone people who were put on some type of blacklist
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:32.880]  and prevented from from entering the venue and it's really interesting because the people who
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:38.240]  were banned from c pack are the same type of people who are usually on these splc lists
[1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:45.120]  and when i was uh banned after i confronted oliver darcy who works for cnn and uh you know has lobby
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:51.600]  facebook and twitter to ban you and people like like me and many others right wing watch which is
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:58.640]  a branch of splc an actual hate group uh reached out to c pack they wrote an article about me accusing
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:04.240]  me of being an anti muslim conspiracy theorist and they titled it why did c pack give media credentials
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:09.680]  to laura lumar and then when i was banned they posted a celebratory tweet a retweet of the
[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:14.880]  article in which they said we wrote this article yesterday and since publication c pack has revoked
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:20.880]  lumars media credentials so i think it's really absurd that here i am one of donald trump's fiercest
[1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:27.120]  uh defenders i'm a very well known conservative journalist i've done amazing work for the trump
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:32.080]  administration even when i was working as an undercover journalist for project baritoss some
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:37.360]  of my investigations had been tweeted by president trump uh he mentioned some of the videos during
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:42.320]  the presidential debates with hillary clinton and so expand on that exactly trump doesn't know
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:49.600]  all that they're literally demonizing the president's foot soldiers and acting like it's all bad and
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:55.680]  demonizing you and it's it's it's beyond pathetic and then literally the republican party itself
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:00.400]  just grovels to mainstream media because the average republican leader is like 89 years old
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:07.920]  nothing mean they're literally 89 years old super rich billionaires like on life support in nursing
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:14.720]  homes and they're just like oh we got a call it looks bad oh get rid of them oh so we're led by
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:23.200]  geriatrics that are groveling and then trump's whole support is being cut out from under him
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:29.600]  and then you're there simply trying to cover things and and like oh it's why oliver darcy laughs
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:37.680]  because he's in control they run everything it's it's incredible yeah no it's really absurd and
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:43.280]  this is a legitimate question this is journalism i've been asking oliver darcy why he lobbied
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:47.600]  facebook and twitter something that is a factual news report i mean this was this is well known
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:52.560]  if you look at the timestamp twitter and oliver darcy literally posted the same tweet at the
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:58.000]  very same time the day that you were banned from twitter and so uh for this to happen right i don't
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:02.560]  think that's a coincidence i think that they're obviously colluding and we now know that the
[1:41:02.560 --> 1:41:08.080]  splc and and groups like care and many others are working with these tech companies and left
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:13.120]  wing news organizations to ban and silence and censor i'm glad you mentioned care because here's
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:21.360]  the deal i'm not against islamics themselves but care day one they spread their money islamic groups
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:27.120]  all of it anybody that opposes them is shut down and so i'm just proud to stand against this but
[1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:32.320]  that's exactly what we're talking about is these groups laura that think we don't have free speech
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:37.520]  in america and i think it's a big joke and to watch oliver darcy laugh about it he's an he's
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:43.280]  just something else yeah well he laughs about it and then he has all these other uh fake news
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:50.000]  shills people like molly jong fast and this guy named christopher mathias who works for
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.920]  huffing glue posts and people who have falsely accused me of being things and i confronted christopher
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:42:00.320]  as well and i said you know you call me a white supremacist and an anti muslim bigot and a racist
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:06.000]  in your in your articles why don't you uh correct the record and these people are such cowards and
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.240]  they just they try to avoid eye contact with me and then they go you know they don't agree they
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:15.520]  always run in fear what's just like they're like zombies why do you think laura they always run
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:21.280]  they run their cowards their keyboard warriors and unlike them i actually take the fight to the
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:26.080]  streets and i get in people's faces and confront them because i'm not a pussy you know and a lot
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:31.040]  of these people are they if you're gonna talk about people and you're gonna lie about people
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:36.160]  and you're gonna write about people and you're gonna open your mouth and make money uh defaming
[1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:40.880]  other people when you then you better be able to answer questions you know laura i'm gonna say this
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:48.720]  when you come back stay there but if america's men acted like laura lemur our problems will be fixed
[1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:55.440]  in about five minutes i mean let's just say it laura lemur's got the biggest goddamn balls of them all
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:05.520]  wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights it's about who wants it
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:11.760]  who's prepared to go the longest and who's ready to do the damage we took on hillary clinton we
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:16.480]  stopped her we got a national stand nationals are getting elected all over the world right now

[1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:54.880]  do good job and the rest of it but no more games it's time to go after those attacking our free
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:48:03.120]  speech attacking our sovereignty attacking the very existence of our country because i talk to

[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:38.640]  runs off in the and the criminal uh southern probably law center has her band what do we
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:44.560]  do laura lumar well we need to start fighting back you know and i'm not going to allow these
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.680]  people to deplatform me and censor me you better believe when i find matt schlapp he's gonna get
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:54.720]  lumar too and i want to know why this never trump or who never even supported president trump you
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:49:00.080]  know matt schlapp if you recall didn't even want president trump speaking at cpaq two years ago
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:04.400]  don't you remember matt schlapp was part of this uh this group of people this group of
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:08.880]  conservatives that was supporting ted cruise and other people they didn't even like him and now his
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:14.000]  wife is enjoying the benefits of working in the white house and they're trying to pretend like
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:19.840]  they don't even know about this censorship one of your correspondents jake actually confronted matt
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:24.480]  schlapp about banning me and other conservatives they had a cpaq and then they're all these big i
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:31.920]  don't care of their whatever they are these big bloated nelley guys like oh and it's just like
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:37.600]  disgusting well he pretended like he didn't know what what uh what jake was talking about but how
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:42.240]  do you not know what he's talking about when i was literally the number one trending story on
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.800]  twitter yesterday for getting banned at cpaq i don't even have a twitter and yet i keep trending on
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:51.040]  twitter number one so one of these people going to learn that no matter how much they ban me my
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:55.680]  ideas are so great and the people want to hear my message so much that they can't suppress it
[1:49:55.680 --> 1:50:02.000]  notice that laura is the you're exploding we're exploding you you were on joe rogan and you need
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:06.080]  to tell joe rogan to stop like nagging me and avoiding me because i've been contacting him
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:11.200]  and trying to get on his show to set the record straight about jack dorsey and you trended number
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:15.840]  one i trended number one jake of wall trended number one all these people who are banned
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.520]  managed to trend number one and obviously their censorship isn't going to work because you can't
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:27.360]  kill an idea and people like joe rogan even though he you know he caved to everybody's criticism and
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:32.400]  had you on the show he wouldn't have done that unless people spoke out he let jack dorsey get
[1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:37.440]  away with lying he said that he didn't know why you were banned but you know one thing that you
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:42.240]  should have really pressed joe rogan on is why he takes money from twitter twitter is one of his
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:47.360]  donors one of his sponsors so why is joe rogan if he really is your friend if he really does
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:52.640]  care about you on a personal level why is he taking this blood money from jack dorsey that doesn't
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:59.760]  look like a very good friend to me alex what i know is whether it's google or twitter or facebook
[1:50:59.760 --> 1:51:04.960]  as long as they allow free speech i don't care if they're rich and and they're powerful i'm just
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:13.600]  sick of them literally trying to suppress western speech it's it's incredible yeah well you know it's
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:18.960]  uh something needs to be done about it and at c pack i actually uh i wore a free loomer.com t-shirt
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:23.680]  those are going to be available on my website soon and i read uh stop the bias hat and i saw
[1:51:23.680 --> 1:51:28.960]  don jr and i actually uh ran through the hallways and i gave don jr one of the stop the bias hats
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:33.120]  and i uh i said hey you know when is your dad gonna do something about this so so that all of his
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:37.760]  biggest supporters are not censored don't you think it's time something's done and he told me he agrees
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:42.640]  with me and so i was able to get him to endorse the stop the bias movement and you know you can
[1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:48.960]  see my video which i posted on uh instagram and he actually was waving the hat and uh a lot of
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:52.640]  members of the trump administration actually approached me this weekend here at c pack and
[1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:57.760]  told me that they're on our side and that's the good news and you know me too and i'm glad you're
[1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:04.160]  saying that is that is that trump and them get it but they need like nerves they need our stimulus
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:08.960]  and i'm saying hey this is what we want so they get that heat we just sit back as
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:13.760]  nationalists or conservatives or christians or whatever and just put up with stuff we get
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:18.880]  screwed over but if we're vocal and involved and put pressure on things things will change
[1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:23.760]  laura lumber thank you so much god bless you yeah thanks for having me out well there goes
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:30.160]  laura lumber and she made a lot of great points today and so did the crew and i'll be back tomorrow
[1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:38.080]  11 a.m central we're gonna have the uh david night show that comes on at um
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:48.320]  8 a.m and you've got the war room that comes on after i go off at 3 p.m central but
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:54.800]  but laura is saying is absolutely true about what's happening and and the average republican
[1:52:55.600 --> 1:53:00.640]  operative will tell you oh we agree with you but there's all these little politicos that are
[1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:05.680]  in between there that are trying to like curry favor and do side deals and things
[1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:08.800]  with the democrats and it's it's called treason
[1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:17.520]  is really what it's called but uh we've got mike adams encounter thing coming up on this show ends
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:23.680]  here in just a few minutes and then we've also got a lot of other key topics to cover you know i
[1:53:23.680 --> 1:53:29.680]  didn't get to the human mice hybrids that are mainstream news and at a certain point i can't
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:36.080]  be expected to handle all this but i'm doing the best job i can without going completely crazy
[1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:41.280]  and so i think in the last few minutes of this broadcast we won't get to all of it but i want
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:47.280]  to end with trump rock c-pack because i could have done the whole two-hour show with trump's two-plus
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:52.160]  hour speech that was pretty damn powerful the complete opposite of every Clinton so here's
[1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:58.480]  the first few minutes of trump rocks c-pack the full reports up on info wars dot com and news
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:04.000]  wars dot com john bound put together and then we'll be back tomorrow 8 a.m a day of the night
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:10.400]  11 a.m of myself 3 p.m with Owen shroyer so here's that report you know i'm building the wall
[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:16.720]  we're finishing the wall we got a lot of money we're down to 3.7 percent unemployment the lowest
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:23.440]  number in a long time companies are roaring back into our country and now we want people
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:28.560]  to come in we need workers to come in but they've got to come in legally and they've got to come in
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:36.080]  through merit merit merit while president trump promoted common sense at c-pack regarding the
[1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:42.080]  long overdue security of the u.s. southern border bernie sanders announced his presidential bid
[1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:47.920]  from his hometown of brooklyn new york pushing the hordes to swallow his hollow message claiming
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:57.600]  xenophobia and racism are behind president trump's policies black and white latino asian american
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:06.400]  native american gay and straight young at all men and women native born and immigrant we are together
[1:55:11.200 --> 1:55:15.200]  and together we will transform this country
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:24.560]  the american people are merely collateral damage to be ignored as the democrats press the will of
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:35.600]  their un master's replacement migration directive 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes 25 000 burglars
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:44.560]  4 000 kidnappings and 4 000 violent murders these are people that ice is going in and getting
[1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:49.920]  and either putting in jail or ideally bringing them back to other countries and letting them put
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:55.520]  in jail because we don't want them we don't want to have to pay for them for 50 years all the nonsense
[1:55:55.520 --> 1:56:01.200]  you hear about the people that come in illegally are far better than the people we have it's not
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:13.520]  true folks okay it's false it's false propaganda one recent study from fair f a i r found that
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:20.400]  illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents those are the numbers
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:28.160]  and if you look at prison population in federal prisons these federal prisons are at the number
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:33.200]  is staggering but you don't hear that you hear like these people are the greatest people in the
[1:56:33.200 --> 1:56:40.480]  world just ask the angel moms how good are they this is my son that's all i have left of him is
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:48.000]  ashes and this is not a manufactured crisis this is real this affected my life it destroyed my family
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:54.800]  and i'm tired of being insulted and re victimized by politicians who don't speak up for us they speak
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:57:00.000]  up for illegals for lawbreakers the president's plan is not to make us safer it is in fact an
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:05.040]  attempt to fulfill his campaign promise to build an unnecessary wall that he said mexico would pay for
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:13.680]  there is no emergency at the border uh furthermore it appears that uh instead of protected our national
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:21.440]  security that the president's declaration actually steals billions of dollars from high priority
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:28.800]  military construction projects we've heard a lot of cries from the administration about
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:36.160]  there being a problem on the southern border with caravans have loaded with people being human
