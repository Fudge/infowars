[00:00.000 --> 00:29.720]  To say that there is an information overload is an
[00:29.720 --> 00:34.520]  understatement. Yesterday a memo was released that's been
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.440]  confirmed to be real. It was a communique to the Iraqi
[00:39.440 --> 00:44.920]  parliament and presidents saying Trump wants to pull the
[00:44.920 --> 00:48.240]  troops out and so does the Pentagon. Now I knew when I
[00:48.240 --> 00:50.240]  saw the document it was real because I've seen a lot of
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.360]  them. I also knew because the Iraqi president had said two
[00:55.360 --> 01:00.640]  days before that he had received the communications from
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.560]  Trump and the Pentagon saying they were ready to pull out.
[01:05.560 --> 01:09.240]  That's been Trump's public policy that he wants that. There
[01:09.240 --> 01:13.760]  are forces behind the scenes that don't want that. Well, then
[01:13.760 --> 01:16.080]  we heard, oh, it's not a real memo, but later they head of
[01:16.080 --> 01:21.640]  the army said, no, it is a real memo, but it was not a final
[01:21.640 --> 01:28.560]  draft. So folks, stuff like that is an accidentally released as
[01:28.560 --> 01:31.680]  the Pentagon said that it was an honest mistake. No, this is
[01:31.680 --> 01:39.160]  part of something a lot bigger. And it ties in to the Iranian
[01:39.160 --> 01:42.360]  government listing their targets. They said they'd list
[01:42.360 --> 01:46.400]  their targets and 35. They want you to attack. They want the
[01:46.400 --> 01:48.960]  left to attack. They say they're with the American people
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.880]  are joining the anti Trump movement, along with CNN saying
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.880]  attack Trump's private properties. Attack him, attack his
[01:55.880 --> 02:00.680]  family. Unbelievable. That's all coming up. But the biggest
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.600]  news of the day is an exclusive. We'll tell you all about it when
[02:05.600 --> 02:08.440]  we come back after this break. But all this talk of killing
[02:08.440 --> 02:11.200]  Trump can give the deep state the cover to assassinate the
[02:11.200 --> 02:11.600]  president.
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.160]  Warning, the stage is set for Trump's assassination. Could the
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.120]  deep state use threats from Iran to complete their coup
[02:22.160 --> 02:24.920]  against President Trump? You take on the intelligence
[02:24.920 --> 02:27.960]  community. They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at
[02:27.960 --> 02:30.440]  you. Government's going to kill this guy. The establishment
[02:30.440 --> 02:34.400]  might have finally set the stage for the perfect false flag to
[02:34.400 --> 02:38.760]  bury the president. Here's the scenario. We all know the evil
[02:38.760 --> 02:43.200]  Democrats would love to orchestrate a JFK style coup to
[02:43.200 --> 02:46.880]  get rid of Trump, but fear the repercussions would mean another
[02:46.880 --> 02:50.960]  civil war in America. Normally, the criminal elite would not be
[02:50.960 --> 02:54.560]  opposed to civil war as long as they were able to maintain
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.520]  order out of chaos. However, the assassination of Trump would
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.720]  not work in their favor. American patriots on the streets and
[03:02.720 --> 03:06.760]  within the military would rise up and destroy the Democratic
[03:06.760 --> 03:10.480]  Party and their brainwashed supporters with a vengeance.
[03:10.480 --> 03:17.520]  Enter the enemy within the neocons. The recent decision to
[03:17.520 --> 03:22.640]  authorize a US air strike that barbecued Iran's top general
[03:22.640 --> 03:27.520]  Qasem Soleimani was a bold and justified response to Iran's
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.200]  terrorist campaign throughout the Middle East. Nobody mourns the
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.960]  death of Soleimani. May he rot in hell. But the action could
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.680]  very well set the course for a much larger conflict in the
[03:38.680 --> 03:42.040]  Middle East and might have sealed the fate for President
[03:42.040 --> 03:46.520]  Trump here at home. Now both sides of the establishment left
[03:46.520 --> 03:49.520]  and right have the opportunity they've been waiting for the
[03:49.520 --> 03:55.080]  ultimate false flag attack to strike down our president because
[03:55.080 --> 03:58.920]  now if Trump gets assassinated, the American people will no
[03:58.920 --> 04:03.760]  longer suspect the criminal cartel operating the deep state.
[04:03.840 --> 04:07.600]  Instead, they will blame the murder on Iran and the American
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.720]  media will fully support that narrative. This will ultimately
[04:11.720 --> 04:16.280]  prevent civil war and divert the people's anger away from the
[04:16.280 --> 04:19.960]  treasonous Democrats. The death of Trump would mean no
[04:19.960 --> 04:22.880]  indictments against Democratic leaders, Hollywood
[04:22.880 --> 04:26.640]  celebrities, wealthy elites like George Soros and criminal
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.680]  operatives within the mainstream media. The establishment would
[04:30.680 --> 04:34.520]  regain total control of the White House. The American people
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.120]  would be duped into another war and the military industrial
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.760]  complex would once again be satisfied. Now am I saying this
[04:42.760 --> 04:47.240]  is absolutely going to happen? No, this is not a prediction.
[04:47.280 --> 04:54.200]  This is a warning. Trump better watch his ass. Spread the
[04:54.200 --> 04:55.680]  video. It's a bandod video.
[04:59.320 --> 05:03.440]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars of family of
[05:03.440 --> 05:07.600]  listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the
[05:07.600 --> 05:10.960]  air. And I spent a lot of time thanking you. But I really think
[05:10.960 --> 05:13.800]  you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.440]  changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as
[05:16.440 --> 05:19.520]  modern ball of ears. But something I should spend more time
[05:19.520 --> 05:23.880]  on is just reminding you that these products are really
[05:23.880 --> 05:26.920]  amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the
[05:26.920 --> 05:29.240]  third party test out there, the air filtration, the water
[05:29.240 --> 05:32.800]  filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.000]  to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.680]  that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden
[05:41.680 --> 05:47.440]  to support info wars. It really is something that is good for
[05:47.440 --> 05:51.120]  everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your
[05:51.120 --> 05:54.120]  life and your family's life and your children's life so much
[05:54.120 --> 06:08.960]  better. So visit info or store.com today. Waging war on
[06:08.960 --> 06:15.880]  corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[06:15.880 --> 06:27.200]  lines of the info war.
[06:28.200 --> 06:36.280]  India's Tuesday, January 7, 2020. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:36.880 --> 06:39.920]  You're in defiance and globalist tyranny by your
[06:39.920 --> 06:47.720]  sufferance by your support. 2020 was promised to be a very
[06:47.720 --> 06:55.560]  tumultuous year of big events and it's not disappointing. So far
[06:55.560 --> 07:03.720]  the old Chinese proper of may you live in interesting times, a
[07:03.720 --> 07:10.720]  double edged sword, a two sided coin. There's an old Russian
[07:10.720 --> 07:15.760]  saying Ronald Reagan picked up popularizer in the US. And
[07:15.760 --> 07:21.800]  that's trust but verify. I like President Trump and I want him
[07:21.800 --> 07:24.720]  to succeed. I want to restore our republic. And I want to
[07:24.720 --> 07:32.440]  empower our people. And I believe Trump believes he did the
[07:32.440 --> 07:37.040]  right thing when he killed Soleimani last week. But
[07:37.040 --> 07:40.200]  Darren Breen put together an extremely important report
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.720]  that's at band.video and news wars.com. And up on the front
[07:45.720 --> 07:48.880]  page of info wars.com that really needs to get out to
[07:48.880 --> 07:54.240]  everyone that I'm gonna play coming up at the bottom of the
[07:54.240 --> 08:01.040]  hour. Video report warning. Stage set for Trump assassination to
[08:01.040 --> 08:06.280]  two minute 46 second report. And it's extremely powerful. And
[08:06.280 --> 08:24.080]  it's a real scenario. Now, we're gonna roll through that. Coming
[08:24.080 --> 08:28.520]  up at the bottom of the hour. And tie it into Iran threatens to
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.640]  attack Trump. And his private properties as well as his family
[08:32.960 --> 08:40.480]  big Steve Watson article up on info wars.com. And the Iranians
[08:40.480 --> 08:45.920]  have issued more threats of $80 million bounty. Dr. Carlson who
[08:45.920 --> 08:48.240]  I agree with has come out and said the same people who lied
[08:48.240 --> 08:53.040]  about WMDs in Iraq are pushing conflict with Iran. They're all
[08:53.040 --> 08:56.880]  over Fox News calling for leveling Iran turning them into a
[08:56.880 --> 09:02.840]  glass parking lot, attacking their cultural sites, saying
[09:02.840 --> 09:07.920]  that's something that al Qaeda does. Well, al Qaeda is the
[09:07.920 --> 09:11.880]  arch enemy of the Iranians. And it's not the Iranians that are
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.120]  known around the world if they take over an area for blowing
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.720]  up archaeological sites. That's the obvious out of Saudi
[09:18.720 --> 09:24.200]  Arabia. So the ignorance out there just rains. But I'm not in
[09:24.200 --> 09:29.960]  the business of defending the Mullahs are Iran. And if Trump
[09:29.960 --> 09:32.840]  really believed that Soleimani was about to launch all these new
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.440]  takeover attacks in the Middle East, and that killing him when
[09:37.440 --> 09:39.560]  he was on the terrorist list on the rest of it was the right
[09:39.560 --> 09:45.080]  move to do. I give the president the benefit of the doubt. But
[09:45.080 --> 09:49.600]  now that I saw the president start talking about, Oh, we're not
[09:49.600 --> 09:52.120]  gonna leave till you pay for our bases. Well, they didn't ask us
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.720]  to come there. They didn't ask us to build those bases. And I
[09:54.720 --> 09:58.240]  say we get the hell out and let them sort it out themselves.
[09:58.800 --> 10:03.320]  They can all kill each other and let God sort it out. But if
[10:03.320 --> 10:06.120]  Trump believes he's gonna have to have some strikes to get us
[10:06.120 --> 10:11.640]  out of Afghanistan and out of Iraq, which is what happened in
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.200]  Syria, you just can't pull out automatically. If you get attacked,
[10:16.200 --> 10:19.280]  you gotta strike back, or it becomes a route. Then that's
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.920]  gonna happen. I don't expect US military to never be in any
[10:21.920 --> 10:26.360]  conflict. I'm not an absolutist that just says we have no right
[10:26.360 --> 10:31.280]  to ever defend ourselves or strike out at someone that we
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.400]  believe is preparing to attack us. And it depends on who's
[10:35.400 --> 10:38.400]  leading the country. You can't believe a word out of Obama or
[10:38.400 --> 10:41.640]  Hillary or Bush senior or Bush junior and I was against all
[10:41.640 --> 10:54.120]  those wars. But that said, people like Pompeo and others who
[10:54.120 --> 11:00.880]  have been big Russophobes and who really presided over the
[11:00.880 --> 11:04.840]  bipartisan sellout to China. I don't trust him as far as I
[11:04.840 --> 11:10.080]  can throw them. And you're seeing a lot of big pushes to
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.520]  again, expand attacks on Shiite targets around the world and
[11:13.520 --> 11:18.200]  escalate the situation. Now I'll tell the Iranian something, if
[11:18.200 --> 11:20.600]  they think threatening the president or attacking the
[11:20.600 --> 11:23.680]  president or attacking his properties is going to be popular
[11:23.680 --> 11:26.440]  with American people because they're watching US satellite and
[11:26.440 --> 11:29.560]  think that mainstream news represents the American people.
[11:29.720 --> 11:32.520]  You've got another thing coming. The worst thing Iran could
[11:32.520 --> 11:38.640]  ever do is have somebody truck bomb a Trump property, a golf
[11:38.640 --> 11:42.840]  course, a hotel, a casino, a condo complex. The worst thing
[11:42.840 --> 11:48.200]  you could ever do the American people would demand massive
[11:48.200 --> 11:54.840]  retaliation because you may have a lot of brainwashed people but
[11:54.840 --> 11:57.240]  they get that when a foreign power says we're going to kill
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.440]  your president, we're going to target their family that it's
[11:59.440 --> 12:05.680]  cowardly. It's it's it's stupid. And it's going to blow up in
[12:05.680 --> 12:08.040]  their face and the Iranian government has officially been
[12:08.040 --> 12:11.760]  tweeting this out. So you talk about a wild escalation and
[12:11.760 --> 12:14.960]  saying, we have zero problem with you Americans. We know you're
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.760]  good. We like you. We're your friends. We just don't like your
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.320]  president. Trump needs to be removed. The yellow haired crazy
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.720]  man must die. These are quotes I've got right here from their
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.720]  government Twitter accounts and speeches they've given. And so
[12:31.720 --> 12:35.520]  that is just wild rhetoric. And we heard rhetoric like that
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.560]  before Soleimani got killed by the Ayatollah saying you can do
[12:40.560 --> 12:43.760]  nothing will blow you up will blow Israel up will blow everybody
[12:43.760 --> 12:46.720]  up. And when you're when you're shooting your mouth off like
[12:46.720 --> 12:48.920]  that and you've got paramilitary forces around the world,
[12:49.280 --> 12:57.720]  expect to get attacked. I mean, I've got a big old gun safe right
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.840]  there with 50 caliber rifles the whole nine yards. And I would
[13:00.840 --> 13:04.440]  expect that if I started saying, I'm going to attack somebody
[13:04.440 --> 13:07.080]  with those which I would never do. I'm going to do something
[13:07.080 --> 13:10.440]  big I can blow you away that somebody probably come blow me
[13:10.440 --> 13:14.920]  away. Because people know I tend to do what I say I'm going to
[13:14.920 --> 13:18.840]  do. The Iranians do too. So you start shooting your mouth off
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.960]  like that and you're known as a country that doesn't they'll say
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.920]  they'll do we'll get ready to get killed. So we shouldn't forget
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.400]  that this is not a vacuum here. And then Iran has been grabbing
[13:29.400 --> 13:32.280]  ships has been shooting down drones been pulling a lot of
[13:32.280 --> 13:35.160]  crap. And that's because they've been working with back
[13:35.160 --> 13:39.080]  channels with Obama and Kerry and others trying to embarrass
[13:39.080 --> 13:41.560]  Trump. And they may have maneuvered Trump into this
[13:41.560 --> 13:43.920]  though by killing Soleimani something they didn't expect.
[13:45.360 --> 13:48.000]  Giving them the cover now to have deep state assassinate
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.960]  Trump, which I think is a real danger and blame it on Iran.
[13:52.560 --> 13:54.480]  I mean, they did that with Sirhan Sirhan and said he did it
[13:54.480 --> 13:56.760]  for the Palestinians turned out he didn't even you know, shoot
[13:56.760 --> 14:00.440]  anybody his hand was pinned. There was a CIA operative behind
[14:00.440 --> 14:04.520]  Robert F. Kennedy that shot him multiple times back. That's all
[14:04.520 --> 14:10.000]  been declassified. CIA was there and what happened? And Sirhan
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.800]  Sirhan spoke out how he was drug given an amnesia by the girl
[14:12.800 --> 14:18.520]  in polka dot dress. Make no mistake, this is a major
[14:18.520 --> 14:23.400]  escalation. And then you add the official letter about the US
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.480]  saying they're pulling out of Iraq. When three days ago, I was
[14:27.480 --> 14:31.160]  up here going Oh, look, here's the Iraqi president saying he's
[14:31.160 --> 14:33.800]  been contacted by the Pentagon and confirmed that they want to
[14:33.800 --> 14:37.280]  pull out the Trump says pull out. Well, then the letter comes
[14:37.280 --> 14:40.440]  out and the Pentagon goes that's not real. When they go well,
[14:40.440 --> 14:47.640]  that is real. So it's a big deal, ladies and gentlemen, we're
[14:47.640 --> 14:50.320]  gonna be going over all of that. That was from January 6
[14:50.360 --> 14:54.360]  yesterday that letter. So there is a lot of stuff going on a lot
[14:54.360 --> 14:57.400]  of civil war going on inside the government. People ask me is
[14:57.400 --> 15:02.120]  Trump for real. Trump's 100% for real. Does that mean 100%
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.720]  good? No, no, no. It means he really thinks he's the president
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.080]  he's trying to be the president. And there hasn't been a
[15:09.080 --> 15:11.280]  president like that in a long, long time. And the power
[15:11.280 --> 15:14.640]  structure and these bureaucracies, they're accustomed to
[15:14.640 --> 15:18.400]  calling all the shots. And so their whole system is up turned
[15:18.400 --> 15:22.520]  right now. And that's why they hate Trump is because he's
[15:22.520 --> 15:25.720]  taken their power away and they think they own this country.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.600]  And they think they're there to sell it out to the highest
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.680]  better. But does that mean Trump's infallible? Absolutely
[15:31.680 --> 15:35.280]  not. Does that not mean he couldn't be led into a trap? Does
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.080]  that mean this whole war thinks next to high heaven? Absolutely
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.920]  it does. We've got some clips of what they're Carlson saying,
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.080]  what the Democrats are saying, what Trump's saying. It's all
[15:46.080 --> 15:48.760]  coming up. Are there a bunch of dangerous war hawks and chicken
[15:48.760 --> 15:51.440]  hawks and neocons that are licking their lips? Absolutely
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.840]  right. Is the back of my neck hair tingling? You bet it is. We're

[16:15.840 --> 16:19.040]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance prices

[16:21.800 --> 16:23.960]  on the East Bank of the Mississippi. Because of the
[16:23.960 --> 16:26.400]  flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.080]  temporary location and rather than move it back to the
[16:29.080 --> 16:31.520]  warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that
[16:31.520 --> 16:34.880]  might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters
[16:34.880 --> 16:37.320]  backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out

[18:00.280 --> 18:03.160]  toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.680]  week and a half and I told Alex I said man this is the best
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.920]  toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you
[18:08.920 --> 18:10.600]  doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up
[18:10.600 --> 18:14.760]  there and tell me and oh so here I am telling people super
[18:14.760 --> 18:18.360]  silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've
[18:18.360 --> 18:21.400]  ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.160]  different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big
[18:25.160 --> 18:27.640]  difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[18:27.640 --> 18:31.240]  because after I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean
[18:31.240 --> 18:33.880]  and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my
[18:33.880 --> 18:37.400]  mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good. It
[18:37.400 --> 18:40.920]  feels like it feels like good things are happening in my
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.080]  mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to
[18:45.080 --> 18:47.960]  four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I
[18:47.960 --> 18:51.480]  like the way it feels.

[20:42.360 --> 20:46.360]  But info wars has had babies that are growing up to be big
[20:46.360 --> 20:49.640]  giants of the fight like summit.
[20:49.640 --> 20:55.720]  Got news and other great sites out there as well.
[20:56.280 --> 20:58.680]  Okay.
[21:00.600 --> 21:04.280]  I run into this problem a lot that we bite off more than we can
[21:04.280 --> 21:07.800]  chew. But I think part of life in this universe and
[21:07.800 --> 21:11.720]  consciousness is that we're all doing things that are above our
[21:11.720 --> 21:16.040]  pay grade. We're not God. And we have a big report on the
[21:16.040 --> 21:19.240]  shelf that just so big so huge so important that we never
[21:19.240 --> 21:22.280]  finished it and never got it out. And that's the micro chipping
[21:22.280 --> 21:24.760]  of the homeless confirmed and witnesses all over the country
[21:24.760 --> 21:27.080]  and the documents the admissions and trying to get the
[21:27.080 --> 21:29.640]  hip of forums to be able to cut the micro chips out live on
[21:29.640 --> 21:33.320]  air. That's where we're at. That's that's coming soon.
[21:33.320 --> 21:35.320]  Took us about three weeks longer to put out the vaccine
[21:35.320 --> 21:40.280]  special showing all the new damage is there.
[21:40.280 --> 21:45.160]  But I became aware of something last night
[21:45.160 --> 21:52.680]  that was hiding in plain view and that I already knew.
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.760]  And then when I discovered this little piece of information
[21:58.760 --> 22:01.240]  it reminded me of all the other information so I went and
[22:01.240 --> 22:05.960]  decided to do some searching. So my children went to bed at
[22:05.960 --> 22:09.880]  about 930 and I ended up staying up till 2
[22:09.880 --> 22:13.480]  a.m. and I was so upset by this but also
[22:13.480 --> 22:17.400]  so sure it's the zeitgeist and how to defeat the globalist
[22:17.400 --> 22:20.120]  that I got up at 430. So I slept two and a half hours and I
[22:20.120 --> 22:23.960]  feel great. Two and a half hours.
[22:24.760 --> 22:28.600]  I had my first cup of coffee at about 5 a.m.
[22:29.560 --> 22:33.000]  And I envisioned how I'd do big PowerPoint presentations in here
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.680]  kind of like I did on the big Epstein update and how we bring all these
[22:36.680 --> 22:39.560]  drafts out and
[22:39.560 --> 22:46.840]  and how I had intended to do this a year ago.
[22:49.640 --> 22:51.640]  And
[22:53.400 --> 22:56.360]  let me just do it this way.
[23:00.920 --> 23:04.200]  It's pretty sensational
[23:04.200 --> 23:09.640]  that Trump can't get rid of Brennan's security clearance.
[23:09.640 --> 23:12.760]  Former head of the CIA he ordered it it's just not done
[23:12.760 --> 23:15.880]  and Brennan goes on TV and says we're going to take you out with the
[23:15.880 --> 23:20.040]  intelligence agencies through the intelligence committee in the house
[23:20.040 --> 23:23.560]  totally legal and they all laugh and say thank god for the deep state
[23:23.560 --> 23:28.760]  and Brennan makes jack-o-lantern demon faces on TV.
[23:28.760 --> 23:31.960]  There's all a confidence act in front of all these
[23:31.960 --> 23:37.880]  these followers. DC is just full of followers and trash.
[23:37.880 --> 23:41.960]  And see that's just one little micron of this.
[23:45.800 --> 23:49.640]  So Tom Pappert has been investigating this and I'm glad
[23:49.640 --> 23:52.280]  he cares.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.840]  And so he texted me last night he said have you seen my article on this
[23:56.840 --> 23:59.800]  and I read the article and I called him back and I said yeah your article gave
[23:59.800 --> 24:02.200]  me a headache.
[24:02.840 --> 24:09.480]  I said you're you're focusing on one operative out of the state department
[24:09.960 --> 24:16.280]  former CNN of course same group who is going around fact-checking
[24:16.280 --> 24:20.360]  conservatives and getting people banned. I said do you notice that he's attacking
[24:20.360 --> 24:24.040]  Trump and backing the Ukraine garbage and the impeachment garbage
[24:24.040 --> 24:26.840]  and do you notice it's funded by the state department that's the state
[24:26.840 --> 24:30.600]  department funding the move against Trump and I
[24:30.600 --> 24:33.880]  said and look right here and I said I'm glad you wrote this
[24:33.880 --> 24:36.840]  article. It just it gives me a headache because
[24:36.840 --> 24:40.120]  we'll focus in on somebody doing an article about how we're liars or how
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.480]  we're bad and of course it's not true.
[24:44.440 --> 24:47.560]  But instead of making about our national files under attack or how info
[24:47.560 --> 24:50.440]  war is under attack
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.840]  you go look at it and it's thousands of government employees
[24:54.840 --> 24:57.800]  and contractors
[24:59.640 --> 25:04.600]  who are funded by a group set up by Obama
[25:04.600 --> 25:10.520]  in 2016 that's still ongoing and then they're given the power position at
[25:10.520 --> 25:16.360]  Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter to ban anyone they want
[25:16.360 --> 25:21.240]  and it's a stay-behind network and then I went and looked and this is what
[25:21.240 --> 25:24.760]  Pappert brought up he's super smart I'm not complaining about Pappert I'm saying
[25:24.760 --> 25:28.440]  so much data came up it gave me a headache that Pompeo
[25:28.440 --> 25:31.400]  is running it and knowingly brought these people in
[25:31.400 --> 25:34.600]  because we went and tracked where he knows them he controls them and is
[25:34.600 --> 25:37.800]  undermining Trump's base while right there with
[25:37.800 --> 25:42.040]  Trump just like McMaster and just like Fiona Hill that we first exposed
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.080]  and you know it was Roger Stone did that here
[25:45.080 --> 25:48.840]  he's facing prison for that and they made Fiona Hill
[25:48.840 --> 25:53.080]  during the impeachment hearings you know a victim of Roger Stone and Alex Jones
[25:53.080 --> 25:56.040]  and they called us Russians and all this crap because we're
[25:56.040 --> 25:59.640]  loyal Americans against these globalists
[26:04.040 --> 26:09.160]  so I'll get to this next hour I'm going to go over all the documents and the
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.360]  rest of it but the way to approach this is this
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.440]  there are giant rogue government groups
[26:16.440 --> 26:21.960]  bipartisanly arrogantly they think they own this country and own you
[26:21.960 --> 26:28.760]  who are undermining America and attacking Trump's policies across the
[26:28.760 --> 26:33.480]  board and attacking the Second Amendment and attacking
[26:33.480 --> 26:37.400]  replacement migration saying that doesn't exist when it's official U.N. policy
[26:37.400 --> 26:41.080]  and attacking the refugee centers that are being staged to flood us
[26:41.080 --> 26:44.040]  and they they go out and say none of that's true because it's the State
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.800]  Department still running it and then they get anybody shut down online
[26:47.800 --> 26:52.920]  that's a Paul Revere and exposes that the ocean's blue
[26:57.720 --> 27:00.680]  so it's on so many fronts they're running the censoring they're running the
[27:00.680 --> 27:02.840]  control they're running the bullying they're running the
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.880]  de-platforming they're running getting people's bank accounts taken away
[27:05.880 --> 27:10.120]  now they're going after the NRA and Trump is presiding over all the
[27:10.120 --> 27:14.760]  censorship and these people that are undermining him
[27:14.760 --> 27:17.880]  and then their funding ran out last year that Obama had put in
[27:17.880 --> 27:22.280]  for two and a half years and Pompeo moved it into another agency and
[27:22.280 --> 27:25.560]  increased the funding
[27:28.040 --> 27:31.080]  and then we're like well let's go search all these people out and Papert had
[27:31.080 --> 27:35.080]  already done it turns out Papert knows Pompeo
[27:35.080 --> 27:37.560]  tell you some stories behind the scenes because
[27:37.560 --> 27:40.360]  Papert has a tv station Pompeo used to come in there on it all the time he was
[27:40.360 --> 27:43.800]  a congressman in Kansas
[27:47.320 --> 27:50.680]  and we went and looked and I spent hours last night this morning and
[27:50.680 --> 27:55.240]  Pompeo's running them all he's a big fat neocons just like
[27:55.240 --> 27:59.000]  McMaster's we all know that just like Fiona Hill but
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.080]  you get rid of one group you get another group and then now when I look at him on
[28:03.080 --> 28:09.160]  tv and he's up there and and he's the super patriot in all this
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.440]  but he presided over the sellout to China he didn't do jack crap
[28:12.440 --> 28:17.160]  he's there to divert us like a magician to
[28:17.160 --> 28:22.200]  Russia when Russia is incompetent when it comes to being able to take over the
[28:22.200 --> 28:26.440]  U.S. when the globalist or ally with China and and had taken us over and
[28:26.440 --> 28:30.760]  weren't fighting for our lives and it makes me sick
[28:30.760 --> 28:38.360]  and Pompeo's a big fat bully and he runs un-american organizations and the CIA
[28:38.360 --> 28:41.480]  which are illegally being directed through the state department group
[28:41.480 --> 28:44.280]  to silence me and silence you and everybody else
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.360]  and it's un-american crap Pompeo's a trillion times bigger threat than the
[28:48.360 --> 28:52.040]  Russians he's bringing KGB evil to America and
[28:52.040 --> 28:57.640]  undermining our president these people let me sick

[30:02.680 --> 30:06.600]  the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago
[30:06.600 --> 30:14.360]  the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[30:14.360 --> 30:18.760]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine
[30:18.760 --> 30:22.680]  it is live it's not even attenuated
[30:22.680 --> 30:27.080]  they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly non-lethal
[30:27.080 --> 30:31.240]  same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly
[30:31.240 --> 30:36.360]  killed a name so many this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest
[30:36.360 --> 30:39.160]  outbreaks of ebola ever since they started
[30:39.160 --> 30:42.600]  giving the vaccine there in the last few years oh and of course opening the
[30:42.600 --> 30:45.400]  borders up here and letting people in un
[30:45.400 --> 30:49.800]  vetted the democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the
[30:49.800 --> 30:53.880]  magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted ebola

[32:35.080 --> 32:38.440]  out of the way support this man everything that he exposed nobody knew
[32:38.440 --> 32:41.560]  about the heme and grove nobody knew about fd nobody knew about bill the
[32:41.560 --> 32:44.520]  bird nobody called 9 11 before it happened in july
[32:44.520 --> 32:48.200]  2001 go look it up yourself well we try our best sir they definitely want to
[32:48.200 --> 32:51.080]  stop the air without you or not here but yeah these are all great products so
[32:51.080 --> 33:01.080]  thank you sir
[33:01.080 --> 33:08.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:19.400 --> 33:26.200]  warning the stage is set for trump's assassination could the deep state use
[33:26.200 --> 33:31.000]  threats from iran to complete their coup against president trump you take on
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.760]  the intelligence community they have six ways from sunday at getting back at
[33:34.760 --> 33:38.120]  you government's going to kill this guy the establishment might have finally
[33:38.120 --> 33:43.320]  set the stage for the perfect false flag to bury the president
[33:43.320 --> 33:48.280]  here's the scenario we all know the evil democrats would love to orchestrate a
[33:48.280 --> 33:53.320]  jfk style coup to get rid of trump but fear the repercussions would mean
[33:53.320 --> 33:58.520]  another civil war in america normally the criminal elite would not be opposed to
[33:58.520 --> 34:02.040]  civil war as long as they were able to maintain order
[34:02.040 --> 34:06.200]  out of chaos however the assassination of trump would not work
[34:06.200 --> 34:11.000]  in their favor american patriots on the streets and within the military would
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.280]  rise up and destroy the democratic party and
[34:14.280 --> 34:18.840]  their brainwashed supporters with a vengeance
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.520]  enter the enemy within the neocons the recent decision to
[34:24.520 --> 34:29.640]  authorize a u.s. airstrike that barbecued iran's top general
[34:29.640 --> 34:33.640]  qasem salamani was a bold and justified response
[34:33.640 --> 34:37.080]  to iran's terrorist campaign throughout the middle east
[34:37.080 --> 34:40.760]  nobody mourns the death of salamani may he rot in hell
[34:40.760 --> 34:45.560]  but the action could very well set the course for a much larger conflict in the
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.280]  middle east and might have sealed the fate for president trump here at home
[34:50.280 --> 34:55.320]  now both sides of the establishment left and right have the opportunity they've
[34:55.320 --> 35:01.560]  been waiting for the ultimate false flag attack to strike down our president
[35:01.560 --> 35:05.400]  because now if trump gets assassinated the american people
[35:05.400 --> 35:09.640]  will no longer suspect the criminal cartel operating
[35:09.640 --> 35:13.640]  the deep state instead they will blame the murder on iran
[35:13.640 --> 35:17.320]  and the american media will fully support that narrative
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.120]  this will ultimately prevent civil war and divert the people's anger
[35:22.120 --> 35:27.640]  away from the treasonous democrats the death of trump would mean no indictments
[35:27.640 --> 35:31.720]  against democratic leaders hollywood celebrities wealthy elites like
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.280]  george soros and criminal operatives within the mainstream media
[35:36.280 --> 35:40.280]  the establishment would regain total control of the white house
[35:40.280 --> 35:45.080]  the american people would be duped into another war and the military industrial
[35:45.080 --> 35:49.400]  complex would once again be satisfied now am i saying
[35:49.400 --> 35:55.160]  this is absolutely going to happen no this is not a prediction this is a
[35:55.160 --> 36:02.360]  warning trump better watch his ass
[36:02.360 --> 36:07.000]  now this very important report is posted at bandot video it's supposed to the
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.480]  top page on news wars dot com it's titled video report warning
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.920]  stage set for trump assassination need to get that out people need to know
[36:16.920 --> 36:20.040]  what's going on trump needs to understand the danger
[36:20.040 --> 36:25.080]  and by us exposing this it'll take this obvious move
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.640]  away from the globalist
[36:32.920 --> 36:35.320]  now
[36:35.320 --> 36:42.840]  i was going to take calls during the sour but i'm just running out of time
[36:42.840 --> 36:46.120]  and i have too much i'm going to cover so
[36:46.120 --> 36:48.680]  we may take calls later in the broadcast but we're not going to take calls
[36:48.680 --> 36:53.560]  now in the summer just to let you guys know that
[36:58.280 --> 37:01.160]  so um
[37:01.160 --> 37:09.160]  i don't want to just sit up here and chatter about all the stuff
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.920]  this isn't just one more channel with somebody else's views or opinion
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.280]  there are thousands of contractors and government bureaucrats
[37:20.280 --> 37:23.640]  interfaced with the dying dinosaur corporate media
[37:23.640 --> 37:27.800]  actively engaged in suppression of american voters
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.320]  of american business of american ideas and of loyal american patriots
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.880]  and they are now going after the nra's gun ranges and trying to shut them down
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.640]  they are now suing the nra they're suing gun manufacturers they are
[37:41.640 --> 37:47.400]  trying to take our speech away not just our second amendment
[37:47.400 --> 37:51.480]  and still president trump does nothing
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.920]  and then we have these giant
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.160]  stay-behind networks
[38:02.520 --> 38:05.960]  of permanent bureaucracy
[38:05.960 --> 38:20.440]  that openly are undermining the american people
[38:22.040 --> 38:27.240]  by this entitled group
[38:27.240 --> 38:36.920]  of criminals
[38:37.320 --> 38:44.920]  and i don't know if the president knows this is going on
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.720]  i know he knows a lot of what's happening but i know that the big job of
[38:51.720 --> 38:55.160]  McMaster and kelly and the rest of them was
[38:55.160 --> 38:59.240]  quote keeping info wars articles away from the president that was in the news
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.720]  and the white house said that we don't let him have info wars
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.800]  talking about him like he was a lobotomized monkey or something
[39:07.800 --> 39:13.560]  and why was it because we're like hey Fiona Hill hey McMaster
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.640]  me roger stone talked to big national donors that were at dinner with McMaster
[39:17.640 --> 39:21.640]  when he was calling the president a moron of an idiot McMaster was so drunk
[39:21.640 --> 39:27.320]  drinking expensive red wine that was just pathetic and it came out
[39:27.320 --> 39:32.360]  a year later in the new york post that that meeting word for word did happen
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.400]  and trump went and talked to the people the big donors and they said yeah no
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.400]  McMaster said all that about you
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.000]  and it's the same thing i mean they're so arrogant
[39:45.000 --> 39:54.520]  and they just get away with all this and now Pompeo
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.560]  refunded this operation and i don't mean refunded like you bring a
[40:01.560 --> 40:05.800]  product back i mean he he continued the funding when it ran out
[40:05.800 --> 40:11.160]  for obamas countering foreign disinformation propaganda group
[40:11.160 --> 40:15.480]  and there's all the things that come with that
[40:15.480 --> 40:22.200]  and all the things that go with that and it's just mind blowing
[40:25.240 --> 40:29.160]  that's who's running the ai machine learning algorithms
[40:29.160 --> 40:32.760]  that are watching everything you do everything you say and then suppressing
[40:32.760 --> 40:36.280]  it and blocking it and you never know that it got suppressed and you never
[40:36.280 --> 40:40.840]  know it got blocked that is in the official documents and statements
[40:40.840 --> 40:45.240]  by the state department groups and people heading up the departments i'm
[40:45.240 --> 40:48.840]  going to go over that coming up with tom pampered of national file
[40:48.840 --> 40:52.040]  com you can read their quotes about we have
[40:52.040 --> 40:56.360]  machine learning that blocks the fake news at the user level
[40:56.360 --> 41:00.680]  both by users and by the producers
[41:01.880 --> 41:05.960]  to the article rogue trumps state department
[41:05.960 --> 41:09.240]  uses taxpayer dollars facebook fact checkers to fight
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.880]  misinformation and propaganda and then you go into it
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.400]  and it's the very people that overthrew ukraine
[41:17.400 --> 41:20.920]  and they're trying to overthrow trump by name running it
[41:20.920 --> 41:27.800]  Pompeo had the nest of obama people and hillary people and
[41:27.800 --> 41:33.640]  kept them there and protected them tillerson protected them fiona hill
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.080]  protected them mac master protected them and now
[41:37.080 --> 41:42.840]  they got protected by pompeo and they're actively attacking info wars
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.160]  and actively attacking paul watson and actively attacking tom pampered by
[41:47.160 --> 41:50.200]  name oh there's no replacement migration
[41:50.200 --> 41:53.000]  there's no un plan to flood you that's all official
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.160]  there's there's no uh un resettlement plans for
[41:57.160 --> 42:00.680]  strong cities for the breakdown of the u.s announced by the state department
[42:00.680 --> 42:06.120]  announced by the justice department because this is illegal dangerous crap
[42:06.120 --> 42:09.320]  and they can't have us as loyal americans up there exposing it
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.960]  so they use a cold war program of countering the russians
[42:13.960 --> 42:18.280]  to ship billions overseas and then attack us from computer networks and
[42:18.280 --> 42:23.240]  media outlets in europe to get around the propaganda laws
[42:23.240 --> 42:26.040]  which obama repealed so there's no reason to do that so why are they doing it
[42:26.040 --> 42:28.680]  from europe
[42:28.680 --> 42:33.560]  because they can launder the money better over there
[42:33.560 --> 42:39.320]  it's all coming up today ladies and gentlemen
[42:39.320 --> 42:42.600]  and and if we understand this it's not just about info wars being attacked
[42:42.600 --> 42:46.760]  it's about these mold networks of unamerican globalist trash
[42:46.760 --> 42:50.200]  that are both republicans and democrats undermining our country and our
[42:50.200 --> 42:54.120]  president and bringing iron curtain of kgb level tyranny
[42:54.120 --> 42:57.720]  here to our free speech we'll be right back
[42:57.720 --> 43:02.280]  the globalists know that i will never willingly give up
[43:02.280 --> 43:05.560]  i've said it many times i will never give in
[43:05.560 --> 43:11.640]  i will never give up but i could give out and it's very very frustrating to see
[43:11.640 --> 43:14.440]  them committing all their crimes against humanity
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.760]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know
[43:18.760 --> 43:22.840]  that most americans have already been silenced in cyberspace
[43:22.840 --> 43:27.000]  that most americans have already been shadow banned by big tech
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.560]  and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.840]  power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com
[43:36.840 --> 43:41.080]  info wars dot com and bandot video and that people are hungry for the truth
[43:41.080 --> 43:44.920]  now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the band truth they don't

[43:56.280 --> 44:00.200]  fair and square in the year 2020 crazed
[44:00.200 --> 44:03.880]  leftists are literally crawling out of their political graves
[44:03.880 --> 44:08.600]  and attacking americans that dare not submit to their bullying
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.360]  2020 2020 is here and despite all the globalist efforts

[44:58.920 --> 45:02.040]  it's either happened to every person listening
[45:02.040 --> 45:05.800]  or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[45:05.800 --> 45:11.080]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.360]  have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.840]  and they get the worst case of the flu of their life
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.600]  but still like concentration camp victims
[45:22.600 --> 45:26.200]  they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics
[45:26.200 --> 45:30.280]  to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government
[45:30.280 --> 45:34.040]  studies in canada and europe show that when you take the flu vaccine
[45:34.040 --> 45:37.320]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season
[45:37.320 --> 45:42.040]  by lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments
[45:42.040 --> 45:45.000]  have never guessed the next year's mutation
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.240]  that the flu vaccine has never ever even worked
[45:49.240 --> 45:53.160]  but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the giant hoax going
[45:53.160 --> 45:55.960]  no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record
[45:55.960 --> 46:01.080]  happening right now i would thank you for everything you've done for the info
[46:01.080 --> 46:04.440]  war but i know you're like me you don't want my thanks
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.200]  you want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.560]  and you want them off your back and off your children's back and you know what
[46:11.560 --> 46:14.840]  i'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team
[46:14.840 --> 46:18.280]  and it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again
[46:18.280 --> 46:23.240]  when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the
[46:23.240 --> 46:26.600]  globalist because i'm committed to a future
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.240]  for humanity and i know you are as well so thank you in 2019
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.280]  for standing with us because you are the info war and i want to thank you
[46:34.280 --> 46:37.640]  for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can
[46:37.640 --> 46:41.480]  for bottom my heart for my family and from the great crew at info wars
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.080]  i want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not
[46:45.080 --> 46:49.000]  just words that's reality you have made history
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  we have made history together info wars dot com
[46:53.000 --> 46:59.480]  only has power because of you and i suggest you use it
[46:59.480 --> 47:21.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:21.320 --> 47:26.840]  welcome back i'm your host alex jones you know when i do all this research
[47:26.840 --> 47:29.560]  most of it i've already done years ago i just gathered up again
[47:29.560 --> 47:34.440]  it it made me physically angry last night this morning
[47:34.440 --> 47:40.440]  going and watching videos training videos about the state department and the cia
[47:40.440 --> 47:45.480]  with rooms of hundreds of people learning how to suppress american citizens
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.560]  learning how to lie about us learning how to stalk us and harass us
[47:49.560 --> 47:54.840]  and then to see obama's people kept in there to do this
[47:54.840 --> 47:58.920]  and and to have trump still keeping him there to undermine him and america
[47:58.920 --> 48:03.080]  and i know that pompeo did it
[48:03.080 --> 48:09.720]  and it's because if pompeo didn't these bureaucrats would come after him
[48:09.720 --> 48:16.360]  because they think they own this country what they are is a bunch of police
[48:17.000 --> 48:22.040]  and that's why they hate me because i'm not afraid of them
[48:22.040 --> 48:25.480]  in fact when i look at what lisping chicken neck stupid
[48:25.480 --> 48:30.520]  doddering cowards they are it makes me feel pathetic that i'm ruled over by
[48:30.520 --> 48:34.120]  such a maggot trash
[48:34.840 --> 48:38.600]  that has presided over the sellout of our country
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.640]  and then i see that they want us to be like them
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.240]  and so they force feed the sexualization of children
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.880]  and the sterilization of children and the gmo and the big pharma and the tainted
[48:49.880 --> 48:53.800]  vaccines and all the garbage now look at the evil
[48:53.800 --> 48:57.480]  hollywood filthy elite and all the old hunchback Rothschild
[48:57.480 --> 49:00.840]  all these other skexies
[49:01.080 --> 49:05.080]  and i say to myself how in hades am i ruled over by this
[49:05.080 --> 49:07.560]  garbage
[49:09.560 --> 49:12.920]  makes me feel like crap
[49:12.920 --> 49:23.400]  but it all ties together they lie to trump's face
[49:23.400 --> 49:26.680]  and they brag that they take executive orders and hide them
[49:26.680 --> 49:31.480]  that's criminal sabotage and it's espionage because these people aren't
[49:31.480 --> 49:35.720]  americans they're globalists that's why they all claim they're anti russian
[49:35.720 --> 49:38.360]  anti-communist because they're selling us out to china
[49:38.360 --> 49:41.640]  they want to use another power they claim they're taking our rights away and
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.360]  spying on us and doing all this to keep us safe
[49:46.360 --> 49:50.280]  from the islamic threat that member john brennan helped give the passports the
[49:50.280 --> 49:54.040]  911 hijackers i had the head of the jeta embassy on springman
[49:54.040 --> 49:57.400]  to expose it who watched it happen
[49:57.400 --> 50:03.000]  they were ordered by the cia and by brennan way back then
[50:04.360 --> 50:08.920]  to give them their passports into the u.s to give them their visas
[50:08.920 --> 50:13.160]  even though they were on list as al qaeda
[50:13.160 --> 50:15.880]  so when you look at people like brennan and all this
[50:15.880 --> 50:20.520]  they've committed so many crimes that they think they can blackmail the entire
[50:20.520 --> 50:23.400]  government the deep state that if they're ever gone after
[50:23.400 --> 50:31.000]  they'll release it to the point of the president says take brennan's
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.720]  national security clearance a year ago it became a national
[50:35.720 --> 50:43.000]  scandal
[50:43.320 --> 50:49.000]  and he still has it and said f u trump
[50:51.400 --> 50:56.200]  and it goes on c span and they go thank god for the deep state we're taking him
[50:56.200 --> 50:59.560]  out and he literally goes
[50:59.560 --> 51:03.240]  and makes a satanic gorilla face like impress all the other demons around him
[51:03.240 --> 51:06.840]  look i'll make a demon face like
[51:06.840 --> 51:10.680]  i'm a communist uh i voted communist twice i'm a obvious
[51:10.680 --> 51:13.640]  hate america
[51:13.640 --> 51:17.400]  oh it's all so impressive i'm so scared of you we just put up with these
[51:17.400 --> 51:23.000]  cowardly chicken necks our whole lives and bow to this filth
[51:25.480 --> 51:30.440]  and you want to know who they are you watch hollywood that's who they are
[51:30.440 --> 51:33.560]  they love pedophilia they love devil worship
[51:33.560 --> 51:37.080]  they love disease children they love leaking reactors
[51:37.080 --> 51:40.440]  they love failure they love their father
[51:40.440 --> 51:45.880]  death well guess what i don't love death
[51:45.880 --> 51:54.040]  and i'm not gonna sit here and cowardly you filth
[51:54.040 --> 52:02.200]  why do they call it a swamp
[52:03.560 --> 52:09.640]  because a swamp is bubbling and black and you can't see it when you sink into
[52:09.640 --> 52:13.560]  it and there's things slithering around that's what dc is
[52:13.560 --> 52:19.400]  and it's built on a swamp fittingly
[52:19.400 --> 52:24.200]  and that's where all the social climbers go all the ass kissers all the
[52:24.200 --> 52:27.720]  traders they all go there to hope they can go kiss ass
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.240]  and show what traders they are and move up in the cell out of america
[52:31.240 --> 52:35.240]  see i don't want to be in dc i don't want to be in la i don't want to be in
[52:35.240 --> 52:40.840]  new york i don't want to be at the tip of this demonic monster
[52:41.560 --> 52:47.320]  i want to build a better world and that's why they hate us folks because
[52:47.320 --> 52:51.800]  we're promoting the ideology of liberty and freedom and love of god
[52:51.800 --> 52:56.280]  and exposing their evils they can perch on top dc and have all the fiat money
[52:56.280 --> 52:59.320]  and all the fancy airplanes they want they'll always be
[52:59.320 --> 53:05.080]  hunchback demons they'll always be scum they'll always be pedophiles
[53:05.080 --> 53:09.240]  they'll always be failures and no matter how far they ever physically pull us
[53:09.240 --> 53:13.320]  down will never be who they are
[53:13.320 --> 53:21.640]  and so they jockey around like building castles of sand that fall into the sea
[53:21.640 --> 53:25.400]  trying to intimidate and trying to stomp around and act powerful and act
[53:25.400 --> 53:28.760]  manly that's all they do in dc is try to walk around and
[53:28.760 --> 53:35.400]  project that they're bona fide that they're real and all they are is frauds
[53:35.400 --> 53:45.240]  if genuine is on one side of the universe they're at the other
[53:45.240 --> 53:48.760]  so that's why they have the red carpets all the spectacular stuff is to make you
[53:48.760 --> 53:52.200]  feel small because you don't need them and you don't
[53:52.200 --> 53:56.520]  want them we'll go to tom pappard next hour we're gonna go through this because
[53:56.520 --> 54:00.760]  it ties into the plan to assassinate trump is this war a trick to suckering
[54:00.760 --> 54:04.200]  men well certainly they're gonna try that how the media is combined with the
[54:04.200 --> 54:10.440]  moolas to say trumps bad wow never seen CNN against a war have you now they are
[54:10.440 --> 54:14.760]  it's all coming up next hour with tom pappard and then syrian girl joins us
[54:14.760 --> 54:18.280]  and we'll right shot them with her
[54:21.160 --> 54:23.800]  plight lewis is coming on he's always informative and paul joseph watch
[54:23.800 --> 54:27.400]  himself to the fourth hour i need a plug or we won't be here
[54:27.400 --> 54:31.320]  um like i told you it's not a gimmick that a lot of times the shell gets
[54:31.320 --> 54:36.360]  extended a day or two uh because i'm up here working on news
[54:36.360 --> 54:40.440]  stories and i'm working on things like that and we've got some sales coming up
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.920]  that the ads are going to take some production um and so
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.040]  yes the sale we're doing is doing the best the sales ever done
[54:48.040 --> 54:52.120]  because people know that we've never had stuff at 50 to 75 percent off
[54:52.120 --> 54:55.640]  straw at free shipping double patriot points we sold out of probably half of
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.440]  our best sellers we're on the verge of selling out everything else
[54:58.440 --> 55:03.320]  and so this sale will have to end by tomorrow by
[55:03.320 --> 55:06.920]  thursday by friday i don't know because i'm too busy
[55:06.920 --> 55:09.880]  to go look at all the inventory and make all the decisions they just said all
[55:09.880 --> 55:13.560]  this is sold out this is about to sell out this stuff's coming in a few weeks
[55:13.560 --> 55:17.080]  this is coming in a few months you really need to stop the sale and i said
[55:17.080 --> 55:20.600]  well tell me what we got well we sold out of this we sold out of that we
[55:20.600 --> 55:23.560]  selling out of this we sold out of that but we got this this this this and that
[55:23.560 --> 55:26.520]  that's real popular we got all this stuff and what do you want to do i just
[55:26.520 --> 55:29.640]  said you know when i'm too busy just keep the sale going
[55:29.640 --> 55:33.400]  and people are responding to it and even though a lot of the stuff's being sold
[55:33.400 --> 55:37.080]  at cost or as a lost leader we're keeping the sale going because they said
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.720]  no but we're also selling a lot of stuff where we do make a profit
[55:39.720 --> 55:42.920]  some t-shirts books films folks are really supporting
[55:42.920 --> 55:49.400]  uh and so i'm just going to keep the sale going until i can get these ads cut
[55:49.880 --> 55:51.880]  and i mean i'll and i'll tell you what the new specials are going to be they're
[55:51.880 --> 55:54.040]  going to be good they're just not as wide as this
[55:54.040 --> 55:56.920]  it's going to be on storeable foods water filtration air filtration it's the
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.680]  new year time to get clean time to time to be prepared as well
[56:00.680 --> 56:03.160]  we've got the best units out there but i want to get them in here and show them
[56:03.160 --> 56:06.760]  to you and shoot some produced ads you know it'll it'll take some time not
[56:06.760 --> 56:09.640]  just me up there talking about stuff so that's why i'm going to get that done
[56:09.640 --> 56:13.000]  today or tomorrow and just whenever they are that's the new specials and
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.360]  and we got a few other things but a lot of stuff's going to be sold out so
[56:16.360 --> 56:20.840]  we're going to be promoting books films uh patriot apparel and uh
[56:20.840 --> 56:26.200]  water filtration air filtration for a month because everything's sold out
[56:26.920 --> 56:30.200]  and all that stuff's important it also funds our operation so
[56:30.200 --> 56:33.400]  if you want to fund the operation and get great products that you'll never be
[56:33.400 --> 56:37.400]  able to get a sell this big again if we're ever selling stuff at cost again
[56:37.400 --> 56:40.920]  across the board it means we're closing because this is getting rid of inventory
[56:40.920 --> 56:44.840]  funding into the future and just something i did to know we could operate
[56:44.840 --> 56:49.000]  you know at least through the election uh i mean because a lot of things were not
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.120]  ordering as much inventory and we're going to sell it a little bit higher price
[56:52.120 --> 56:54.920]  and so we can fund ourselves i'm actually doing business planning something
[56:54.920 --> 56:57.880]  i've never really done to be able to fund this but
[56:57.880 --> 57:01.000]  the best deals 2019 are almost over double patriot points

[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:56.040]  those people are the enemy oh you try to teach kids that stuff in russia they
[1:00:56.040 --> 1:00:59.800]  arrest you so you know what they're just pissed the russians got away from
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:05.080]  their pervert asses at least partially
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:08.600]  and so i guess it is a russian conspiracy because the russians got away
[1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:12.440]  from the very same globalist communist filth
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:16.440]  tom papper we're going to get into the big story that your report is a window
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:20.520]  into and just how deep the rabbit hole goes of the traitors against trump
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:23.960]  inside the government who they are and what trump needs to do this to be this
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:27.160]  this is the key to everything he just does this we can take the country back
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:29.080]  and it'll be much easier to defeat the globalist
[1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:33.560]  once we don't have the cia operation mockingbird that's designed
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:38.280]  to defeat foreign enemies that should be taken on the chai comms instead
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:43.240]  pointed at trump supporters and the republican party and populist
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:47.160]  tom papper unbelievable well that's really what i think
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:51.400]  this is i mean i totally came upon this on a fluke and you kind of redirected
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:54.840]  me and said tom look at what you found this is unbelievable
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:59.160]  and this certainly seems like a global operation mockingbird in europe in
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:02.680]  africa in the middle east in asia all over the globe
[1:02:02.680 --> 1:02:07.240]  the united states state department is spending god knows how much money
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:10.360]  to teach quote unquote journalists and activists
[1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:16.120]  to fight fake news misinformation and propaganda and all of this started alex
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:20.200]  right after president trump was inaugurated right after barack obama
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:26.280]  signed the act that gave 160 million dollars to fight propaganda on
[1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:29.720]  december 24 2016 right before trump was coming in
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:33.720]  it just seems a little bit coincidental and now that we've broken this down i
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:37.160]  mean alex the next step is to go and look up who these people are
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:40.280]  and find out exactly how crooked this operation is but
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:44.360]  bare minimum we know that rex tillerson the former secretary of state mike
[1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:48.120]  pompeo the current secretary of state and president trump have all allowed
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:51.800]  this to continue even though it seems to be undermining the administration
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:55.160]  undermining president trump supporters and undermining american
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:58.680]  agenda and throughout the entire world is going to say in the middle east but
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:02.040]  no it's europe it's africa and it's asia everywhere
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:05.480]  state department people then sit as head fact checkers at facebook
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:10.440]  censoring all of us it's they're the new judge jury and executioner they're the
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:12.840]  new soviet star chamber we don't need russians
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:16.440]  to come in at you know time machine from the 1970s here in enslave us
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:20.200]  you know we've got we've got mr pompeo for that
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:24.040]  that's right and that's how this started we got our first strike in national
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:26.680]  file we've made it six months without a strike well now
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:30.520]  a phony little website called lead story it's a man named alan duke
[1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:34.440]  decided that we posted fake news the man can't spell conspiracy theory to save
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.560]  his life according to him it's a conspiracy theory
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:41.000]  but he accuses us of promoting conspiracy theories and so i do some
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.880]  digging and that's how all of this comes to light
[1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:47.960]  it's all in the open it's all right in front of the american people
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:52.760]  they're not even trying to hide it they think we're just too stupid to look
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:56.200]  well let me tell you this is all obama we're going to show the documents the
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:59.000]  history of it we know exactly what's going on but but
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:03.320]  your point about this guy and how pompeo put him in and how pompeo is protecting
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:06.920]  him and how they took that agency that obama set up and moved it into another
[1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:09.320]  one to protect it i didn't know that so that's what
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:12.840]  me doing another deep dive last night off your story
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:17.240]  made me realize is that yeah the funding ended last year that obama
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:20.680]  put into the defense authorization act a few years before but
[1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:25.560]  pompeo continued it oh and then these very groups are going around attacking
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:29.080]  trump and putting out the ukraine conspiracy theory
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:32.200]  that trump was doing all this quid pro quo but we're gonna get that out the new
[1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:37.320]  article and get it to the president so he knows what pompeo did
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:40.440]  and now pompeo sabotaged the north korean peace deal
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:45.160]  and so much more by the way you know pompeo pompeo has tried to literally
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:49.720]  bully you because he is a neocon thug him and
[1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:53.080]  brennan we're right back
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:00.520]  i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:04.440]  the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks ago
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:12.200]  the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:16.600]  to be given inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:22.920]  it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically modified it so
[1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:26.360]  it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with the
[1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:30.680]  garter cell vaccine that's admittedly killed in name so many
[1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:35.480]  this is just crazy and the congos had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:39.400]  since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years
[1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:42.760]  oh and of course opening the borders up here and letting people in
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:46.440]  unvetted the democrats distribute across the country
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:49.880]  you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:56.760]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america this is the new world order
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:01.800]  a lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the american people and
[1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:05.560]  that is a really really an awful situation we are not
[1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:12.760]  the enemy of the american people we love the american people
[1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:24.760]  we are not the enemy of the american people we love the american people we love the american people
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:46.760]  we love the american people we are not the enemy of the american people we love the american people
[1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:56.760]  this is cnn
[1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:12.760]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:20.840]  the iranians have issued an 80 million dollar bounty on the president's head
[1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:26.200]  that was a few days ago now government officials in iran are tweeting out that
[1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:31.800]  they want his properties and his home in marlago attacked along with his family
[1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:37.400]  they say we agree with your cnn we love the american people we are friends of the american people
[1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:46.600]  these are quotes our only problem is trump i'll read you those quotes later don't run we are your
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:53.640]  friends i don't want war with the iranians but they're claiming they're gonna attack
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:08:00.360]  trump properties with civilians in it well that is a war crime killing a general who's
[1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:05.240]  orchestrated massive ied attacks against our troops is certainly a legitimate target does
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:10.120]  that mean it's a good idea the point is is that it's not a civilian target now
[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:16.040]  tom pappert has written for a lot of big publications he also runs a tv station
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:21.480]  that we've been on for years and he also co-hosted some of the shows with us really smart fellow
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:28.360]  but he knows pompeo robackham pompeo was a congressman in his district and would come
[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:33.640]  and come on the tv station that mr pappert manages but now he manages it he just worked there
[1:08:33.640 --> 1:08:42.040]  five six years ago and the story he tells us the story we've heard from other people but
[1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:52.920]  this isn't a pissing contest with pompeo i'm covering this because we covered this we knew
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:58.840]  about it it's central it's huge the general public didn't know how important it was
[1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:04.360]  didn't really get any traction with the audience but boy did it get traction at the white house
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:12.600]  and at the state department from rex tillerson the only hill general mic master
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:26.040]  john kelly remember the headlines wash them post info wars banned in the white house and it was true
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:31.880]  general kelly has to keep it away from him and what was it was roger stone
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.640]  saying phiona hill works for soros headed up his biggest foundation she's bringing in hundreds of
[1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:42.120]  bad people they're gonna leak fake info and claim that trump is engaged in criminal acts and try to
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:51.000]  impeach him in ukraine which all happened i mean roger's smart then roger has dinner with
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.440]  some of trump's biggest donors billionaires in new york they just had dinner two nights before
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:10:05.080]  with national security advisor mic master who was drunk drinking 300 bottles of cabernet
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.840]  so drunk he could hardly talk saying we're gonna overthrow trump he's in moron he's filth
[1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:19.240]  and they were just blown away well trump after he heard about that from roger went and talked to him
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:26.520]  and found out it was true and fired his ass now it isn't about oh look we got him fired we're just
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:33.240]  loyal americans and nobody else will do this everybody else is too busy with their tails
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:38.280]  between their legs rolled over like a little dog pissing all over themselves i'm not living like
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:47.240]  that it's victory or death period it's worse than death to bow to people like mic master
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:50.040]  and fiona hill prince valiant
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:58.520]  and so i out of respect for the president have ignored pompeos neocon pedigree and i've just
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:01.800]  sat there and just you know i don't want to get involved in infighting i don't want to
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:07.640]  the power on the throne and the courtiers in dc and all that swamp activity i'm just here promoting
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:16.040]  freedom and ideology of truth trumps all their garbage but they want us off air because we will
[1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:21.160]  do what nobody else does and if trump doesn't do something about this i don't know what i'm going to
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:32.280]  do but it's dereliction of duty i've waited long enough this is beyond him allowing censorship
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:39.960]  or racketeering there are giant cia public networks that supposedly engage in pro-american
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:47.000]  propaganda overseas against dictatorships now they legalized in 2012 turning that against us
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:52.440]  and obama put two billion into a program he put 160 million to one subsection of it
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:58.920]  in december of 2016 before he left you fund the next year defense authorization act some of the
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:05.400]  funding goes out two and a half years and he signed countering disinformation propaganda act now
[1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:12.920]  under that they engage in this targeting of the american people and paul watson myself tom
[1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:18.440]  papper's national file and people working for that same group with the state department with
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:24.920]  those contracts are training larger groups of people to engage in going around and thought policing
[1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:30.680]  and saying we're fake news and then with that announcement that these state department affiliate
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:36.760]  groups make the government's gotten big technosanon agree that then they censor you so this is what's
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:41.320]  being done to the american people in general and it's like a kgb pollut bureau going around doing
[1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:47.880]  this and it's the epitome of a communist chinese social score and it's illegal as hell now i saw
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:55.720]  tom papper on national file here stay upset tracking one of these groups and he is the head
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:01.080]  guy over one of the fact checkers at the um at facebook's what's the big deal lying about them
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:07.320]  demonizing them about the plan for the u n in the u s and all of it and i said hey that's not the
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:12.760]  story i get that they're coming after you but it shows just eat papertarticle show pompeo
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:16.680]  brought the this group back into the state department when their funding went out last year
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:21.720]  and it turns out knows them and is working with them which we already knew but here it all was
[1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:30.520]  so document cam shot police u s repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:35.640]  so i just told you all this now i'm going to show it to you this is the washington post when they
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:40.680]  put out a publication called foreign policy okay that's 2012
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:50.200]  obama quietly signs the counter disinformation propaganda act into law that's 2016 the 24th
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:58.040]  of december rogue prompt state department uses taxpayer dollars facebook fact checkers
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:03.720]  to fight misinformation and propaganda you read this you see pompeo continuing in all today
[1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:09.800]  with the obama and hillary people and here's one of them facebook's top fact checker tied to u
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:14.040]  s state department disinformation fighting program so that the congressional hearings and say that
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:20.200]  i'm a russian agent because by doing that they can turn loose these foreign offices nato offices
[1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:24.920]  cia against us it's a war why i think the new york times will print stuff as a total lie they've
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:31.000]  been ordered to folks they have embeds in there us back tech camp color revolution revealed by
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:36.680]  ukraine official in a major system overthrowing ukraine a few years ago i mean these are serious
[1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:40.920]  people trying to overthrow trump you go and look at what they're fact checking what they're putting
[1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:45.080]  out it's all trump's a trader trump worked with the russians trump were did this in ukraine
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:52.280]  so the long short of is this pompeo has continued the obama stay behind networks that set up the
[1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:56.840]  whole ukraine thing and tried to set trump up and who are censoring trump supporters
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:02.920]  and election meddling in america right now suppressing news and information of citizens
[1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:11.880]  communication and the first amendment accused trump of election meddling while they're the
[1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:14.520]  ones doing it tom we're gonna come back and give you the floor in the next seven you'll
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:19.160]  write shotgun with us but i had to set the table there in 30 seconds this is a big rabbit hole
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:24.520]  isn't it absolutely alex and it all just kind of fell onto our laps because of their own
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:29.640]  arrogance but what i'd really think that we're exposing in my opinion it's a global operation
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:34.680]  mockingbird it is the state department using taxpayer dollars to recruit people to fight against
[1:15:34.680 --> 1:15:40.760]  patriotic americans like yourself it's disgusting and if mike pompeo doesn't know about this this
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:47.880]  is his golden opportunity to fix it and fix it for good by the way you know mike pompeo uh
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:52.280]  well we're gonna talk about that when we come back and how huge this is you just heard what he said

[1:18:01.960 --> 1:18:07.720]  patriot points it was 75 off with our big year in sale because a lot of the products have already
[1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:12.680]  sold out most the others are about to sell out but quite frankly i've been working on so many big
[1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:17.880]  stories that are breaking right now that i have not come up with new specials and we're already so
[1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:22.360]  close to selling out all these products that i'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for
[1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:28.200]  two more days and we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines it'll take
[1:18:28.200 --> 1:18:33.240]  weeks months for them all to come back in some come in in weeks some come in in like three months
[1:18:33.240 --> 1:18:37.880]  a lot of stuff's coming back in next week so i've just decided because of the inventory issues all
[1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:42.200]  the rest of it and because some of these were selling it losses are making people buy a lot of
[1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:46.600]  other stuff and we are making a profit so i'm going to just keep the sale going but only for 48
[1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:53.720]  hours maximum and then we've got to stop it infowarstore.com the year end now 2020 mega blowout sale

[1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:24.440]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:24.440 --> 1:20:41.080]  i am not in the center of the arena to boast or for my own personal name
[1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:49.080]  i'm in the center of the arena by necessity but if you're going to be in the center of the arena
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:56.520]  as a gladiator for liberty you better be ready to go 100 every day and believe me it's getting
[1:20:56.520 --> 1:21:06.520]  crazy here by the minute what you see on the surface is only one dimension of what's going
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:12.440]  on beneath the surface tom papper riding shotgun with us how do you quantify something this big
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:23.800]  big giant networks well yeah i mean how do you quantify it tom i mean it's hard to explain
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:30.520]  because you're right it is massive it is global there have been dozens of these fake news training
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:36.600]  sessions all across the globe it has been paid it started under hillary clinton and barack obama
[1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:42.760]  it's since grown after 2016 it became massive and you look at some of the attendees and it's
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:48.840]  the people who are fact checking uh babel on b on facebook it's the people who are spreading
[1:21:48.840 --> 1:21:55.960]  disinformation about ukraine they've been alleged to have fomented the revolution the civil war in
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:22:02.360]  ukraine so it's truly insane i mean i think our next step maybe to go get a freedom of information
[1:22:02.360 --> 1:22:08.600]  act request just to find out exactly how much money is it that 160 million dollars is it more
[1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:12.760]  has been spent on this because what they're doing alex is they're training these foreigners
[1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:17.240]  and then half of them end up coming to the state department they brag they say that if you work for
[1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:22.360]  tech camp this organization you might get a job for the state department you might get a job for
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:28.680]  united states embassy or you might get to work for a big american corporation so please come work
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:33.640]  for tech camp because we're going to recruit you and i think that's exactly what they're doing
[1:22:33.640 --> 1:22:37.720]  they're bringing they're finding people abroad because as you said perhaps it's easier to move
[1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:42.200]  the money around when you don't have the american financial system watching over your back they bring
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:48.920]  people in from abroad they recruit them they bring them to groups like lead stories or stop fake or
[1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:54.760]  whatever it may be and they use them there to destroy the american political discourse by
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:59.080]  banning anybody who actually tells the truth if you look into the background of some of these people
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:05.560]  some of them are x cnn journalists some of them are just techno nerd to create giant deep state
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:10.120]  seeming programs that can analyze all the news in the world they're listening to what you and i
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:15.560]  say right now they're probably the reason why if i say alex jones on facebook i can immediately
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:22.600]  get banned it's frightening and the fact is this was all going downhill at the beginning of 2018
[1:23:22.600 --> 1:23:27.720]  it seemed like they were winding down the blog posts on their website were going away they hadn't
[1:23:27.720 --> 1:23:32.280]  published anything for months then they post something about how they they help fight fake news
[1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:40.040]  next thing you know this new woman marie rois who is the wife of a former republican congressman
[1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:47.240]  gets appointed to this role and she becomes the executive director of the eca which is the new
[1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:53.160]  umbrella group that a couple months after she's appointed would become the managers of this tech
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:59.240]  camp group now they're back and bigger than ever it seems as though we've uncovered something here
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:03.240]  and by the way pompeo seems to know that she's been photographed with pompeo she's been photographed
[1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:08.840]  giving awards to these tech camp people who train foreign journalists to hate america and to hate
[1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:15.000]  patriotism so it seems like this is all just happening under the auspices of the state department
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.400]  we're talking alex alex some of these events have hundreds of attendees they do it all across the
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:24.680]  globe i've seen documents where how to host one of these well tom let's be clear for the latest
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:32.440]  long obama set up through the international networks through the cia systems to counter
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:36.520]  trump the american people that was mainstream news i showed those articles earlier the people
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:43.720]  just tuned in now your website national file gets attacked for exposing the un and the bureaucracy
[1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:47.960]  and how the un says they're hiring people in america in new york for resettlement and gun
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:53.560]  confiscation they then put out a story saying you're fake news but then put a strike on you
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:58.600]  online to start censoring you you go look up who it is it's this fighting foreign information
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:02.600]  this information group funded by the state department and you find out that pompeo is
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:08.040]  refunded what we have been exposing and so that's what this is suppression of voters
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:13.800]  suppression of the american people and of course they hire foreigners because foreigners don't
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:17.640]  the average american it's hard to recruit americans to go suppress other americans
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:21.720]  it's why you use foreign troops to suppress a population of course they're hiring foreigners
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:25.880]  to come captain all this and the southern prairie law center and the adl are involved in the same
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:31.320]  groups creating tens of thousands of sensors to come in and watch what we do in real time
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:37.800]  and again pompeo when the funding ended on this that obama put in he created a new system
[1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:42.680]  for these very people to reactivate them and now they're attacking info wars dot com
[1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:49.000]  paul joseph watson summit dot news and national file dot com because you are an evil pro american
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.960]  and paul is for briggs it that's all this is it's sick and it's evil and these people have
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:26:00.120]  censorship power that they're this one guy that attacked you is one of the lead facebook sensors
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:07.400]  and fact checkers so he's a god he's a master he's a king he's a commas are he's a political lord
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:13.720]  you're a peasant tell us about this guy so there's two of them the one who i spoke to on the phone
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:20.760]  yesterday is a man named allen duke who appears to be a 63 year old x cnn journalist who now works
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:26.680]  for a website called lead stories his co-founder martin shank attended this tech camp program in
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:32.840]  2017 as a trainer which implies we couldn't find data but it implies that he was paid by the state
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:37.320]  department to attend this thing he was probably how has probably got a free meal ticket everything
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:43.240]  you can imagine to buy buy the state department 2017 under rex tillerson but this character
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:48.680]  allen duke he again i i mentioned this earlier the man honestly cannot spell the word conspiracy
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:54.760]  theory but he will accuse me of being a conspiracy theorist he wrote this typo laden fake news
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.480]  article claiming that the un article we wrote last week you might remember me on the show
[1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:05.000]  talking about it claiming that this article was all about a job posting in africa it had nothing
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:11.640]  to do with africa it was the new york un office hiring people for disarmament and reintegration
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:17.240]  potentially assumingly american citizens now he found one line where it said well experience
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:22.680]  in africa would be a plus and he extrapolated this to claim that the un job posting was focused
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:27.880]  for africa and by the way you said you said it was multifaceted but loretta lynch said they want
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:32.600]  the un here for police oversight boards and then they want the un to have open boards and they want
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:36.760]  the un to have trump arrested and now they're talking about going to the un for war crimes against
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:41.960]  trump for killing solemony so we all know the un takes over countries we all know democrat
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:45.800]  politicians have called for him to come here and confiscate our guns in your article you have
[1:27:45.800 --> 1:27:51.640]  un officials saying they want to use peacekeepers to take our guns well and what i believe as i
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.720]  believe your ar 15th right i believe this character this allen duke i don't have proof of this i'm
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:01.960]  not going to say fake news but i think that he probably gets his marching orders and the marching
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:07.080]  orders are likely to totally read just move this to the side say it's not about america it's about
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:12.200]  africa cc no big deal don't look the same thing you don't look here cohen said arrest anyone
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:18.280]  that says there's a thing called replacement migration from the un when that's official
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:24.280]  and microns called for it and and they call for 600 million here 250 million in france alone and
[1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:30.680]  i mean it's insane so again we're talking about the microcosm of how we're under attack by name
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.400]  slash america and arrest me for for saying something was true then they have these fact
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:40.440]  checker groups come out and say we're liars so cohen can go look an independent group says they're
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:46.600]  liars when it's not it's the state department but again who's funding it trump the american people
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:51.880]  trump needs to fire these people trump needs to do something about pompeo we'll be back
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:59.080]  stay there papertsering girls coming up as well fellow patriots my name is todd savage founder of black

[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:07.560]  and to counter trump and to try to set him up in ukraine other areas well it turns out that
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:12.920]  the funding ended last year but pompeo as the new secretary of state he continued it and created
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:20.360]  a new agency subgroup for the obama and hillary and soros people to continue operating putting
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:27.320]  out fake news against the american people voter suppression and then also operating as fact checkers
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:35.480]  of fake news who then liaison inside big tech facebook google apple twitter to then censor and
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:42.360]  de-platform people when they give the word and what's incredible about this is it's one thing to
[1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:45.880]  say these are big corporations they can do what they want but that's not what's happening but
[1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:50.920]  chai comms tell people that operate in china what they want and big tech clicks their heels and says
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:57.160]  how high when they say jump the eu is controlling the type of speed chapeting on the internet now
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:06.120]  and now we know that the obama era individuals are in there anti-american globalist and are
[1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:12.120]  censoring national file info wars daily caller bright bark they're all being listed as fake news
[1:35:12.120 --> 1:35:20.840]  by individuals that are getting government contracts taxpayer money to do it and if you
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:25.720]  look right here this is from foreign policy us repeals propaganda ban spreads government made
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:32.680]  news to americans that was eight years ago this is how the washington post and foreign policy dot
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:42.600]  com and then they call that once they do the propaganda oh we're countering russians disinformation
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:47.720]  but really it's the american people and his president trump no pompeo is doing this and
[1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:51.720]  running this and we went and looked at what these groups are doing it's fact checking trump as a
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:58.120]  liar saying trump being quid pro quo these groups are attacking people defending trump and telling
[1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:04.040]  the truth and are attacking the president you know pompeo knows that
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:12.920]  stories up at info wars dot common national file us back tech camp same subgroup color
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:18.360]  revolution revealed by ukraine officials in their parliament this same group because that's
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:23.880]  who they work for the state department and they do what they're told by the rogue bureaucracy
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:31.560]  still in control and here's pompeo with the individuals that run it for tv viewers just
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:38.200]  absolutely stunning i want to shift gears to the bigger geopolitical operations of all of this but
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:43.080]  this is being run by the u.s government and they're bullying american people they're suppressing
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:49.000]  american voters and then saying if we want trump we're russians we're being influenced by russians
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:54.280]  no they're globalist calling loyal americans foreign enemies so they can turn cia and state
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:59.880]  department operations against us and then big tech is actually following what the state behind
[1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:05.240]  networks and what congress is telling them to do so congress goes oh let big tech operate the way
[1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:11.400]  they want let companies operate you know there but no it's a concerted conspiracy of racketeering
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:17.960]  by big tech with big government and bipartisan move and trumps running around you know hanging out
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:25.880]  constantly with tim cook of apple so the question is if they come this up and sit sir the nationalist
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:30.120]  populist are too powerful you'll get reelected but you need to help us suppress them it could get
[1:37:30.120 --> 1:37:35.320]  out of hand we need balance sir we need to dialectic yeah it's real balance teaching pedophilian
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:41.080]  schools and world government trying to sterilize little boys no there's no balance things are
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:47.720]  out of control in this country and input wars is bringing the balance so patrick putting bookends on
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:53.080]  this uh you get attacked you look at it go oh it's this counter and disinformation propaganda group
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:57.640]  you write about your own personal attack and how they're lying about you but i i called jepa said
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:03.480]  dom you realize in your own article you point out pompeo's running this did you know that this is a
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:08.520]  huge scandal because these groups are attacking trump and that's the next articles i know you're
[1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:14.360]  writing i mean what is it gonna happen when trump supporters get to him that that that that so much
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:20.200]  of the news coming out that trumps a liar and trumps wrong and trumps this the fact checking on him
[1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:25.640]  the little gumballs on cnn that all that fake news playing everything he says is a lie when it's not
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:33.720]  is being quarterbacked by pompeo go ahead well it's coming from the government i mean the government
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:38.840]  is spending money to delegitimize the government in any rational world this would be taken care of
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:43.720]  in about 30 seconds it never would have started but of course we live in clown world with pompeo
[1:38:43.720 --> 1:38:49.000]  is seemingly uh becoming the head clown but we have to see it in i've got the video clips
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:54.840]  siding with iran saying go to the international court of uh war crimes and arrest the president
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:39:01.080]  when would you ever see that and meanwhile of course the the left was calling and still calls
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:06.040]  george w bush a terrible president by any metric but they call him a war criminal for what he did
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:11.560]  trump kills a head terrorist the one of the top guys in iran who ran the revolutionary garden
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:15.640]  and he is a demon but alex i want to give you an example of one of the things that you're and
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:20.840]  my and the the viewers and listeners tax dollars are going toward one of the things this tech camp
[1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:27.800]  does is they fund initiatives that attendees come up with so we the united states state department
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:34.360]  the taxpayers have now funded an effort to meddle in the italian elections we created a
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:41.080]  fake news and bias detection tool with our money that was given to some random guys in italy
[1:39:41.080 --> 1:39:45.720]  so they could keep populace from winning in 2018 this is happening all over the globe and of course
[1:39:45.720 --> 1:39:51.080]  it's happening right here in the united states with the uh inter incestuous relationship these
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:57.240]  group have with this tech camp group with the lead stories the top fact checker by facebook the
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:40:03.960]  official fact checker of facebook that's run by an xcnn journalist this is the most insane thing
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:07.720]  i've ever broken and again alex i do have to say thank you because you're right i had tunnel
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:12.040]  vision i was thinking about alan duke and how this guy can't spell conspiracy theory and you
[1:40:12.040 --> 1:40:18.440]  tell me tom this is pompeo this is pompeo when the funding most likely almost a hundred percent
[1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:25.560]  ran out he found a way to move it to a sister government agency headed by this strong republican
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:32.440]  woman so they could keep manipulating american citizens indefinitely and then the left can
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:37.400]  leave pompeo alone because they know he's double dealing with him this is treachery tell people
[1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:42.360]  your personal pompeo stories because you guys on the tv station you manage it we have owned several
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:46.360]  and i mean you know pompeo tell tell folks how pompeo acts and i've heard these same stories
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:50.280]  it's one thing to blow up sometimes but he likes to bully people tell folks about him
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:56.200]  so the first time i met pompeo was back in 2012 when the propaganda law was signed and at the same
[1:40:56.200 --> 1:41:01.800]  time that it became legal to indefinitely detain american citizens through the ndaa national defense
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:06.840]  authorization act and myself and a bunch of fellow ron paul teenagers and 20-something's
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:13.960]  decided to go confront pompeo on his vote for the ndaa to legalize propaganda and indefinite
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.000]  detention and pompeo i asked the third question you know when you go with a group of people
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.800]  activists you have one two three so it seems like all the questions are about the same topic
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:30.120]  and by time he got to me pompeo i mean alex it was like uh if you were animated and blowing up
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:35.640]  in my face but about six inches away he was screaming at me at a town hall with probably 50
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:40.200]  people in it i only regret that at the time i wasn't smart enough to get video the next time
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:45.320]  i ran into pompeo it was with a friend of mine who used to uh be a co-host of mine on a previous
[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:50.920]  show and uh he did the same thing he goes up to pompeo at a state fair and says uh hey mike why
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:56.200]  did you vote for this uh they got they started having words and i kid you not alex pompeo's
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:01.320]  people had to come and separate the two because i think pompeo would have thrown a punch and then
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:07.240]  years later a couple years go by it gets to be 2014 15 pompeo starts coming to the tv station
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:13.640]  to appear on a local libertarian program and uh share his libertarian street cred as a small
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:19.960]  business owner uh hiding the fact that he was uh uh outsourcing all the jobs he possibly could
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:26.440]  hiding the fact that he is a massive neocon to this libertarian audience but on that show he
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:32.920]  did once say that putin he compared putin to a glorified gangster he said that he is america's
[1:42:32.920 --> 1:42:37.640]  most dangerous enemy and that russia is the biggest geopolitical really i thought it was the
[1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:42.280]  sky com stay there stay there and oh we have syrian girl right there on screen we're gonna come back
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:46.920]  with her and tom papert as well in about 15 minutes the next hour we're joined by clive lewis
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:52.920]  clive lewis and round zero also a really smart cookie i'm alex jones with info wars dot com tomorrow's

[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:06.360]  double patriot points it was 75 off with our big year in sale because a lot of the products have
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:10.840]  already sold out most of the others are about to sell out but quite frankly i've been working on so
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:16.360]  many big stories that are breaking right now that i have not come up with new specials and we're
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:20.920]  already so close to selling out all these products that i'm just gonna go ahead and keep the sale
[1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:26.520]  going for two more days and we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines it'll
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:31.640]  take weeks months for them all to come back in some come in in weeks some come in in like three
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:36.200]  months a lot of stuff's coming back in next week so i've just decided because of the inventory
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:40.760]  issues all the rest of it and because some of these were selling it losses are making people buy
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:44.920]  a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit so i'm going to just keep the sale going but only

[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:08.440]  these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back and off your children's
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:13.800]  back and you know what i'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team and it's why info
[1:45:13.800 --> 1:45:20.840]  wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:27.000]  action against the globalist because i'm committed to a future for humanity and i know you are as
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:32.040]  well so thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war and i want to thank
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:37.880]  you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can for bottom my heart from my family and
[1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:42.840]  from the great crew at info wars i want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know
[1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:49.960]  that's not just words that's reality you have made history we have made history together info wars
[1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:59.000]  dot com only has power because of you and i suggest you use it the globalists know that i will never
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:06.120]  willingly give up i've said it many times i will never give in i will never give up but i could
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:12.520]  give out and it's very very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:19.160]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most americans have already been
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:25.880]  silenced in cyberspace that most americans have already been shadow banned by big tech and to
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:33.080]  know that most americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the
[1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:39.160]  word about news wars dot com info wars dot com and bandot video and that people are hungry for the
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:44.760]  truth now more than ever and then if you tell people hey the band truth they don't want you to have
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:50.440]  is at info wars dot com forward slash show and bandot video so take heart folks they've had to
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:54.920]  censor everybody to show everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us
[1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:59.240]  fair and square
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:07.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:17.240]  you
[1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:26.200]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:32.600]  it's not a gimmick anybody can do the math who's been a customer in info wars for dot com we have
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:40.600]  the biggest sales of our history for the year in 2019 into 2020 we're now seven days into it
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:48.760]  i waited two days longer than i should have to get rid of the sale show that a lot of items we
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:53.080]  could go back to regular price because some of the stuff hadn't come in for a few months and then we
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:58.200]  would sell stuff at regular retail and actually make a profit to fund ourselves well i waited i got
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:02.840]  busy they were telling me you got it in the sale hell last week they were saying i needed in the
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:06.920]  sale at the first of the year and i said no extended you know plus i don't have new specials and
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:13.320]  and i kept extending it until half the stuff sold out now but a lot of other rate products are
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:17.320]  still there and they're still 50 to 75 percent off statewide free shipping double paid rate
[1:48:17.320 --> 1:48:22.520]  points so i just said this morning hell why don't we just keep it up there a couple days and then
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:27.480]  almost everything will be sold out and then i'll promote books and films and t-shirts and other
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:31.560]  things like that until stuff comes back in some of it in a few weeks other products in a few months
[1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.960]  so thank you all for your support but we got to sell a lot of product at this price
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:41.880]  the funder operation some of this stuff's lost leaders but people are buying t-shirts and books
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:47.400]  and films and shortwave radios while they're getting the lost leader supplements that are so good
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:53.000]  and so they were doing some math last night they said well actually this is brought in some revenue
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:59.080]  to help fund into the new year so it worked out so thank you for your support this is the best
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:04.360]  deal you'll ever get well we'll never be able to offer sales like this again infowarstore.com
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:07.800]  i'm going to try to cut some of the ads today and tomorrow and the sale will probably be gone

[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:50.600]  here with the state department and the cia and these global is trying to shut us down
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:54.440]  trying to take us off air and trying to do it to everybody else and the fact that
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:50:00.120]  its state department cia funded groups that then hire the private contractors who were
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:05.320]  then hired by facebook and everybody to then censor anyone when these groups say this and
[1:50:05.320 --> 1:50:11.000]  most of them aren't even citizens it's downright treasonous in my view that pompeo allowed this
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:15.800]  to happen and continued to leave the obama stay behind groups and there it's it's just huge now
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:20.440]  whether it's 15 minutes the next hour than clad lewis is joining us uh is syrian girl
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:25.080]  pappard's riding shotgun a little bit to give his take on this uh as well he ends up national
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:29.480]  file dot com and is a syndicated talk show host a tv host in his own right and manages a couple of
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:35.640]  tv stations were on uh there in kansas uh but but but syrian girl i support trump i think he's a
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:41.080]  good guy and i and i don't like the other guy that got killed and if it was to really end
[1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:45.480]  the war and have the us trips pull out well then i would support it but i think as the days go by
[1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:51.000]  more of your expert um view from living in there and and in covering it as a journalist in your
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:56.040]  family being in government in syria previously uh that it does more and more look like a trap for
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:51:01.480]  trump as the neocons push war as democrats call for war crimes trials as the pentagon put this
[1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:05.720]  letter out that we were going to withdraw the president said two days ago in or three days
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:10.200]  ago in iraq that he talked to trump that we're pulling out now the pentagon says oh well that
[1:51:10.200 --> 1:51:17.240]  letter isn't real then they say it is real uh iran talks about attacking trump's hotels if they do
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:22.840]  that well that'll cause world war three how would you encapsulate for people like nobody else can do
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:27.720]  what's currently happening and and what these different developments mean to you
[1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:35.320]  you well first of all those documents are real they there was a letter that was not signed that was
[1:51:35.320 --> 1:51:40.840]  acknowledging that iraq parliament has requested for the us to leave and that they were they were
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:47.080]  agreeing to pull out obviously that they're denying that that's going to happen they're saying it was
[1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:54.040]  a draft that was mistakenly released as a matter of fact by the way you can see that uh it's the
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:52:00.920]  darkness of that image someone took it with a mobile phone in the dark it's a leak it's a leak
[1:52:00.920 --> 1:52:06.760]  document from an insider was obviously not happy with the way that the dods running things or the
[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:13.160]  people are you know pushing for these wars are running things so what you guys need to understand
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:21.800]  is whilst the media over there have been coming up with some crazy crazy lies about who this man
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:26.840]  Soleimani was and most people in the US didn't even know he existed up until a few days ago
[1:52:27.560 --> 1:52:33.400]  they're saying now he was responsible for 9 11 which is exactly what we heard in the lead up to the
[1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:39.400]  iraq war you know that Saddam Hussein was linked to al-qaeda doesn't make any sense i mean he was
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:45.480]  a bathist secular guy and hated al-qaeda al-qaeda was a threat to him they were always fighting each
[1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:52.520]  other this man this Soleimani he actually has been fighting al-qaeda and ISIS and the Taliban
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:59.480]  for decades he fought alongside the united states in 2002 in Afghanistan against the Taliban and yet
[1:52:59.480 --> 1:53:04.520]  they're trying to make the new narrative like bringing up 9 11 again and we know it's an inside
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:10.600]  job and claiming that this guy had something to do with it it's all beating the drums of war and
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:16.680]  you know if trump was told that this is the way to get the u.s out of iraq i think it's clearly
[1:53:16.680 --> 1:53:22.840]  he's been lied to in that the deep state doesn't want to pull out of iraq they're sending 4 000
[1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:29.720]  more soldiers in and they're denying the iraqi parliament's request to leave so they even though
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:34.120]  three months ago trump was talking about how the middle east was a terrible idea and how
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:41.320]  women that were falling onto the caskets of their sons who died and it's time to pull everyone out
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:47.160]  the opposite is happening now they're putting people in into a country where the government
[1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:52.680]  has requested that they leave and they've turned everyone against them the Sunnis the Shiites you
[1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:59.000]  know what is there to gain from this is the question definitely more money for the military
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:06.200]  industrial complex you know you remind me of that powerful speech trump gave about women throwing
[1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:10.440]  themselves on their sons coffins and how terrible it is now he wants to bring us out of iraq
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:14.920]  there were and and now we learned that trump was in talks with the president just last week
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:19.320]  and was getting ready to order it and then magically they told him something about salamani
[1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:24.280]  that made trump act and i believe trump meant well but i do agree that they're trying to set
[1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:30.600]  trying to set trump up somehow tom pappert what do you think i didn't to agree i mean on paper it
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:35.640]  seemed like it might be a good idea if you swallow what the propaganda was i agree with your initial
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:40.200]  reaction as well alex thinking that perhaps president trump is trying to take out foreign
[1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:45.960]  adversaries before moving against adversaries in the united states legally but the fact is
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:51.640]  this could be a quagmire this could be president trump's iraq war which of course made president
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:56.520]  bush extremely unpopular thanks to the mainstream media and the power they held over the public's
[1:54:56.520 --> 1:55:03.240]  hearts and minds and nearly lost him at the presidency in 2004 and it's like dr carlson said
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:10.200]  you can't trust the deep state they lie so much so so it's it's it's it's just terrible what do you
[1:55:10.200 --> 1:55:14.280]  think's coming next you have amazing contacts the mentally serene girl what do you think's coming
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:20.600]  next well here's the thing the iranians they have to retaliate as i told you guys before
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:25.560]  or basically their own people they would have a problem with their own people if they didn't
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:31.320]  retaliate because this guy wasn't some terrorist that you know he was hiding somewhere and nobody
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:39.480]  was wasn't popular this guy was a very high ranking general that defeated ices in iraq and syria
[1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:46.040]  and helped like not only she eyes but christians christians in syria are protesting the fact that
[1:55:46.040 --> 1:55:52.920]  he was murdered uh one of the christians you know he likened his resistance to al qaeda to the resistance
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:56:00.360]  of uh jesus so the christians in iraq as well and the yazidis especially were uh helped by the the
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:06.120]  paramilitary forces which are being referred to as evil ministers right now um they were helped
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:11.320]  against us i mean there's no doubt there's no doubt that the iranians and the kudz forces were
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:16.680]  instrumental with the russians taking out ices that obama and hillary sent in and then trump took
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:21.320]  credit for that our military did help some but russia was given no credit for that and the iranians
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:26.680]  were given no credit i know he's also done ied's and attacked our forces in iraq so you know i mean
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:34.360]  this is all just the people change sides it goes on sorry i mean um where's the evidence that he
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:39.480]  was responsible for those ied's because as far as i understand there was many forces in iraq
[1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:47.240]  of planting ied's in particular i'd like to see how he how they connected that to him um well actually
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:52.280]  el sotter and uh one of the main leaders as you know the shiites in in iraq and others took credit
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:57.800]  for a lot of that the the first ones and and and throughout the best quality the best quality
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:03.000]  shape charges ied's were coming out of iran i mean i don't think iran made a secret syrian girl
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:07.080]  that uh uh that they've launched offences against the us to drive them out of iraq
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:13.000]  well el sotter was like only a few months ago the media was saying how what a great guy he was
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:17.800]  and how he's gonna take power next and uh the protest movement is pushing him so you know we
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:21.800]  can't believe anything they tell us is the the whole point of this that we can't trust them
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:25.560]  can't trust the deep state because they're constantly live nothing they say well it's
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:30.360]  true that they have no morals they always want more power my question is could the deep state
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:34.920]  now assassinate trump and blame it on iran darin mcgraines put out a very powerful report
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:39.320]  that i want to make the featured video at bandod video um it's it's not the featured video it's
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:43.720]  like buried it's whatever the most powerful as we bury but i'm gonna get to the top of the site
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:52.760]  it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:59.720]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:06.440]  right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still
[1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:13.640]  by concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the
[1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:19.240]  injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada and europe show that
[1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:24.520]  when you take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:30.360]  lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:37.640]  next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you prop up a hoax
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:43.320]  you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu ceases on record happening

[2:00:33.320 --> 2:00:40.040]  experience we go out there and we meet the parents and the families the wives the children
[2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:48.840]  the sisters the brothers we meet them and we talk to them these things are just impossible i don't
[2:00:48.840 --> 2:00:55.240]  know how parents can do it even and i'll be talking to some of the parents and they'll
[2:00:55.240 --> 2:01:01.480]  act like they're fine i said how are you doing we're fine sir we're fine we're really good
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:08.040]  i said that's great and i'll tell the colonel i said colonel i think they're doing great no sir
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:12.680]  they're not going to do great you'll see and i didn't know what he was talking about this is the
[2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:19.640]  first time and then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it
[2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:26.920]  lands and it comes over and it pulls up that door opens up and the colonel told me he said
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:35.240]  sir when that door opens up those same people that you think are okay do things that you'll never see
[2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:41.560]  you will hear sounds like you've never heard that's what he does and i saw that door open up
[2:01:42.120 --> 2:01:49.480]  with a coffin with a flag over it and these beautiful soldiers five or six on each side
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:56.840]  side lifting the coffin and walking down the runway the plank they call it off this cargo
[2:01:56.840 --> 2:02:07.080]  plane and i see parents make sounds scream and cry like you've never seen before a mother who
[2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:13.960]  was fine 20 minutes ago you think breaking the military line and jumping off and then jumping
[2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:21.560]  onto a coffin of her son or her daughter jumping on on top of the flowers on top of the american
[2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:29.560]  flag i've seen this we were supposed to be in syria for 30 days we've now been there for 10 years
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:35.000]  we were supposed to be in afghanistan for a short period of time we're now going to be there for
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:58.680]  close to 19 years it's time to bring them home and now we know and now we know now we know that
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:05.080]  trump had talked to the iraqi president last week before this happened said we're pulling out
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:10.840]  and the letters had been prepared and someone inside the pentagon got mad and sent that letter
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:17.720]  out to the world yesterday and the pentagon confirmed yes it's real the iraqi president
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:22.920]  wasn't lying we were about to leave and then the president was told something by the pentagon that
[2:03:22.920 --> 2:03:29.160]  sulamani was going to launch massive shia attacks across the middle east and so trump decisively
[2:03:29.160 --> 2:03:35.480]  acted because he was on the terror list on a kill list obama had been stopping it obama had back
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:42.680]  channels to sulamani so did kerry and so i said well i backed the president and i still think
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:46.120]  the president thought he was doing the right thing but remember back when the president
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:51.320]  understood that these endless wars were bad just a few months ago that was the video you mentioned
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:57.880]  syrian girl what would you like to say to the president in 60 seconds just to you know remember
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:04.520]  that remember that feeling of the seeing the women crying because that's just going to happen more
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:10.600]  and more and in a much bigger scale this stuff about massive shia attacks iraq we were told is
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:17.640]  60 percent shia it would they they are you know right next door to iran i realized that iraq and
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:26.040]  and the us and iran are in kind of a tug of war over influence in iraq but this is iran's like
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:33.480]  next door neighbor this is not really a something that americans need to throw their lives away on
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:39.720]  i can't understand why that would be in the united states interest unless you think about
[2:04:39.720 --> 2:04:45.480]  raytheon and all the weapons manufacturing companies who have been bombing iraq for the last
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:51.960]  three decades and i've probably have grown addicted to it to the point that pulling out stay right there
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:59.640]  syrian girl andy in florida thank you andy go ahead hey alex i love you man we love you before i

[2:06:15.400 --> 2:06:22.360]  trump issues powerful message on ending war and it's a fact that we went over there and
[2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:27.240]  started these wars it's a fact that the e you then opens its borders of to islamify europe
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:33.800]  and create a global crisis this is a hegelian dialectic to bring in world government based
[2:06:33.800 --> 2:06:41.880]  on world crisis in my view and i know that the kutz forces have funded hezbollah i know they blew
[2:06:41.880 --> 2:06:47.160]  up the marine base i know they are behind the ied's i know their militias are behind driving
[2:06:47.160 --> 2:06:53.560]  out the us forces we shouldn't have been there but that doesn't mean i support people that blew up
[2:06:55.320 --> 2:07:00.120]  friends of mine family of mine with those ied's it doesn't mean that they don't hang political
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:03.880]  dissidents in iran it doesn't mean that women have to wear hijabs there it doesn't mean that i
[2:07:03.880 --> 2:07:09.720]  don't support the iranian people that they want getting a better government but all this happened
[2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:16.600]  because in 53 we overthrew pro-american secularist mohammed mozadek and then we overthrew not we
[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:21.320]  but the globalist the shock is he wasn't following orders and they put the iotolas in there and
[2:07:21.320 --> 2:07:27.480]  that's been declassified and then they had the whole thing in 79 embarrass carter to get reagan
[2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:33.000]  in i like reagan but that doesn't mean i support the deep state giving them the idea to kidnap
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:38.360]  those folks at the embassy and then do all that and that's all come out as the iran congress camp
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:43.800]  they did that and so i was seeing what was happening as a way for them to try to take
[2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:50.200]  over that embassy to hopefully get hostages to then make trump look weak and then i think
[2:07:50.200 --> 2:07:55.800]  trump acted to look strong because the back channel of obama and carry were working through
[2:07:55.800 --> 2:08:00.600]  sulamani in the iranians to embarrass trump because sulamani was becoming popular and was
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:04.520]  moving in the middle east that was one angle i saw it doesn't mean it's totally accurate but
[2:08:04.520 --> 2:08:09.160]  that's what i saw in closing tom pappard what's your view on that the big picture and we'll finish
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:15.560]  up with syrian girl well alex you are correct that the united states has a terrible terrible
[2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:20.840]  terrible luck with regime change in the middle east has it worked in europe yes has it worked in
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:27.080]  asia yes to some extent with japan and germany in the second world war but ever since the 1950s
[2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:32.440]  we have failed time and time again at killing dictators and replacing them with either democratic
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:36.760]  governments or better dictators so there is absolutely no reason to believe that if the
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:42.360]  deep state gets its way and there is a full-scale invasion and regime change in iran that it would
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:48.280]  work any other way it will likely just be another country now the the eighth and 15 or 20 years that
[2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:54.520]  the united states invades or bombs topples the government and leaves a smoldering ruin and as
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:09:02.120]  you know alex in 1973 iranian girls looked like maryland monroe they went around in bikinis and
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:07.320]  they they didn't have to cover their face and now they look like garbage bags so the united
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:13.080]  states has already had a terrible record in iran well you're absolutely right and we need to uncover
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:18.600]  all these girls look at look at syrian girl right here so i really do appreciate you tom
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:23.480]  pappert your fine points at national file dot com i know you've got more reports coming out on the
[2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:28.360]  clinton obama stay behind networks that that pompeo has allowed to stay at the state department
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:34.120]  to censor the american people and suppress voters and undermine president trump really huge news
[2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:42.200]  breaking over at national file dot com thank you tom thank you alex syrian girl one thing about
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:46.280]  being a good talk show host is they say you got to be decisive and you got to stick to your guns
[2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:52.680]  well i never did that on purpose uh but when it comes to this war when it comes to middle east
[2:09:52.680 --> 2:09:59.000]  when it comes to all the triple dealing uh i am double minded some i support the president i'm not
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:04.680]  in love with sulamani but it's true the west started the arab spring to put al qaeda isis al
[2:10:04.680 --> 2:10:10.120]  nuzra saudi arabian backed really nasty people in control of libya in control of egypt in control
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:15.480]  of syria and then finally trump got in ran paul was against it and everybody else said we were
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:21.240]  not al qaeda's air force and we stepped aside and let russia uh and i ran go in and clean that out
[2:10:22.200 --> 2:10:28.360]  and now sulamani and others have been rewarded for that help by being killed um that is a
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:33.160]  perspective and i and i think really if you have to weigh it i think overall you're right
[2:10:34.040 --> 2:10:38.200]  that you can't say he's a great guy helping take out al qaeda and then a year later
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:43.160]  kill him uh and uh you know say all of this because if they were always saying he was bad
[2:10:43.160 --> 2:10:46.920]  from perspective you could respect that but it's this back and forth and i'm really worried
[2:10:46.920 --> 2:10:51.080]  they're they're trapping trump they're trying to escalate a war they've been trying to trap trump
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:55.240]  the moolest shot their mouths off and said you can do nothing trump and you know did do some
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:11:00.280]  provocative stuff so i i see why trump did it but but i agree with you that i think he's been duped
[2:11:00.280 --> 2:11:04.680]  and i think it's like quicksand what would you say about the big picture and where this is going
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:11.560]  and what is your message to president trump well i i think if you support trump then perhaps he's
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:17.880]  in a difficult position and he needs someone to support him and strengthen his position
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:23.160]  to pull troops out of the middle east that trump that we heard three months ago the one that had
[2:11:23.160 --> 2:11:28.600]  tears in his eyes that seemed to be way more authentic than the one we're getting now perhaps
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:35.080]  he's being pressured perhaps you know he's he's he's getting bad intelligence and oh he is not
[2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:42.280]  going to make any statements he's not enjoying the statements not as much as that i saw how much
[2:11:42.280 --> 2:11:47.960]  he enjoyed finally like a sense of release that he could say these things about the middle east
[2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:53.320]  being a bad idea because that's the trump that was elected as well so perhaps you know in supporting
[2:11:53.320 --> 2:11:58.280]  him you could support him in that position and against the deep state that that could be a way
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:03.960]  in which support him but you know those are great points like support support the trump we elected
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:10.360]  not the one the neocons want him to be yes strengthen his back on that position you know show him that
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.880]  his followers that is what they want that is that is with the outcome that they want and if they he
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:21.960]  can see that this is what his base wants then that will give him a tool against the deep state
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:29.160]  to use that look these people don't do people don't want a war i mean the fact that he said that i
[2:12:29.160 --> 2:12:34.520]  don't want a war and this is not going to result in a war just shows that he understands that people
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:39.720]  don't want one but the deep state obviously does and unfortunately i do think that there will be a
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:45.320]  retaliation by iran but the question is is there going to be a subsequent retaliation and a subsequent
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:51.720]  retaliation after that and that's going to be up to the united states so when it comes to you and i
[2:12:51.720 --> 2:12:56.360]  we both agree that we like a secular government we want people to be free to dress as they want
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:13:03.560]  but on the other hand i uh you know iran isn't coming to syria and telling syrians how to dress
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:07.800]  they've never done that hezbollah didn't do that either they came and they fought al-qaeda
[2:13:07.800 --> 2:13:13.800]  they protected some churches uh hezbollah was founded in 1985 the marine base bombing was in
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:20.840]  1983 but somehow the propaganda has made that connection between them it was so but but listen
[2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:26.360]  you're absolutely right let's pull back let's pull back let's pull back then another big point is
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:31.720]  they're saying we'll also target holy sites saying that's what iran does iran is not al-qaeda and
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:37.480]  isis that's who targets holy sites so threatening to blow up iran's holy sites that that is like
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:43.480]  really demanding a war right there and it's not good well you're not just holy sites but like
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:50.600]  persian history sites like um you know persian cities and ruins like five thousand year old ruins
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:55.640]  those are the cultural sites but like iran is currently saying we don't we're not going to
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:14:02.360]  target any civilians that's what the mullah is saying the head guy in iran we're and hezbollah
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:08.040]  saying no nobody targets civilians that's that's just going to make things worse so they're trying
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:13.560]  to control anyone that's if they're thinking anything crazy so that you know there there's
[2:14:13.560 --> 2:14:21.560]  that we have to remember um to to show you that it's not going to go out of control and into
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:28.280]  bombing trump tower i think that maybe that was someone was saying it as a joke like oh what what
[2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:33.240]  historical sites can there be bombed in the united states oh maybe a trump tower you know
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:38.440]  but civilian targets are as they say not on the list more likely they're going to close the
[2:14:38.440 --> 2:14:44.440]  straight of harmus they're going to push us soldiers out of iraq and syria that's a much
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:50.920]  more realistic kind of retaliation that we might see and the question is what will the united states
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:56.520]  response be to that if it was a if it's a military against the military is it going to keep escalating
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:15:01.320]  and is russia coming in because russia's coming in now saying they're going to give us four hundred
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:07.480]  to iraq and their meeting with Assad in syria and what what i based my position on a lot is i
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:12.520]  look at what the syrian christians are thinking on what iraq christians are thinking and they're
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:17.880]  not happy about this assassination on the contrary because it's damaging to them i mean threatening
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:23.320]  iraq with sanctions for asking the united states occupation to be over you know that's going to
[2:15:23.320 --> 2:15:29.320]  hurt christian communities that are still living in side iraq so how is how is that good for the
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:34.120]  middle east all right syrian girl join us again soon always enjoy having you on at partisan girl

[2:17:54.360 --> 2:18:01.640]  i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact that in late 2019 just about two weeks
[2:18:01.640 --> 2:18:12.120]  ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given inside the united states
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:19.960]  and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated they've just genetically
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:25.480]  modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with the garter cell
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:31.800]  vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many this is just crazy and the congos had the
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:37.320]  biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years
[2:18:37.320 --> 2:18:42.680]  oh and of course opening the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the democrats
[2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:49.160]  distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:55.240]  ebola assault on america this is the new world order the best product i'm not i'm not supposed to

[2:20:19.160 --> 2:20:22.600]  mapping the global future smart guy
[2:20:22.600 --> 2:20:29.320]  but i want to ask him up front about trump being set up into a trap jeremy green
[2:20:30.040 --> 2:20:34.280]  came up with this analysis a few days ago brought it to me and i said that should be an article
[2:20:34.280 --> 2:20:40.120]  that should be a video the brain's been here around nine ten years really smart guy his son
[2:20:40.120 --> 2:20:45.080]  works here too does a great job as a rider kello mcgreen married got kids how many yards good
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:52.040]  guys it's a family we've been around a while here got roots and i looked at this and i'm like my god
[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:57.240]  they've really opened the door up i totally agree with this being a real danger they can now kill
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:03.240]  trump employment on iran and get the giant war they've been wanting here it is warning the stage
[2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:11.000]  is set for trump's assassination could the deep state use threats from iran to complete their coup
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:16.040]  against president trump you take on the intelligence community they have six ways from sunday at
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:20.440]  getting back at you government's gonna kill this guy the establishment might have finally set the
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:27.240]  stage for the perfect false flag to bury the president here's the scenario we all know the
[2:21:27.240 --> 2:21:33.720]  evil democrats would love to orchestrate a jfk style coup to get rid of trump but fear the
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:39.560]  repercussions would mean another civil war in america normally the criminal elite would not
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:46.360]  be opposed to civil war as long as they were able to maintain order out of chaos however the assassination
[2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:52.680]  of trump would not work in their favor american patriots on the streets and within the military
[2:21:52.680 --> 2:21:58.920]  would rise up and destroy the democratic party and their brainwashed supporters with a vengeance
[2:22:00.760 --> 2:22:09.240]  enter the enemy within the neocons the recent decision to authorize a u.s airstrike that
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:17.000]  barbecued iran's top general qasem salamani was a bold and justified response to iran's terrorist
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:23.080]  campaign throughout the middle east nobody mourns the death of salamani may he rot in hell but the
[2:22:23.080 --> 2:22:29.000]  action could very well set the course for a much larger conflict in the middle east and might have
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:35.960]  sealed the fate for president trump here at home now both sides of the establishment left and right
[2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:41.800]  have the opportunity they've been waiting for the ultimate false flag attack to strike down our
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:49.240]  president because now if trump gets assassinated the american people will no longer suspect the
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:56.440]  criminal cartel operating the deep state instead they will blame the murder on iran and the american
[2:22:56.440 --> 2:23:03.480]  media will fully support that narrative this will ultimately prevent civil war and divert the people's
[2:23:03.480 --> 2:23:09.960]  anger away from the treasonous democrats the death of trump would mean no indictments against
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:16.200]  democratic leaders hollywood celebrities wealthy elites like george soros and criminal operatives
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:22.360]  within the mainstream media the establishment would regain total control of the white house the
[2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:28.840]  american people would be duped into another war and the military industrial complex would once again
[2:23:28.840 --> 2:23:36.200]  be satisfied now am i saying this is absolutely going to happen no this is not a prediction
[2:23:36.200 --> 2:23:39.640]  this is a warning trump better watch his ass
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:51.400]  and while we get white louis's skype that just dropped back on i want to just remind listeners
[2:23:51.400 --> 2:23:59.720]  that obama hillary globalist deep staters publicly were put into the state department
[2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:06.200]  and other agencies to direct big tech censoring info wars and now all other conservatives christians
[2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:12.200]  and nationalists and trump must act against it it's not just private companies doing what they want
[2:24:12.200 --> 2:24:17.800]  it's rogue government systems carrying this out or maybe trump knows and is suckering us all i don't
[2:24:17.800 --> 2:24:21.960]  think that's the case because they're undercutting him these very groups are saying he's full of crap
[2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:31.160]  it's illegal it's out of control please don't forget that yes we've had that giant year-end sale

[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:45.960]  perspective is dead on but also from an angle that's uh you know pretty technical from the jargon
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:51.480]  they actually use on the inside of the system clad lewis joins us i appreciate clad coming on
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:56.840]  at clad lewis on twitter ground zero media dot org we got a few minutes to break and we'll have
[2:26:56.840 --> 2:27:03.160]  two segments with clad clad thanks for coming on with us today from ground zero your two minutes
[2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:07.880]  summation of what's currently happening in the world what you think's going on we're in war in
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:11.320]  this country that's my two minutes summation i could give it to you in seconds so we're in war
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:17.240]  in this country not only do we see that problems are happening in virginia where we're looking at
[2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:22.680]  possible malicious rising up against state government localization we're looking at what
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:28.360]  the founding fathers had said and that is if we become too hyperpartisan we're certainly going
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:33.320]  to fall into despotism and civil war and it's evident with what's going on also with the middle
[2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:38.600]  east because there's a question as to whether or not a president is used to restrain such as
[2:27:38.600 --> 2:27:42.920]  donald trump has been using as all of a sudden decided that he wants to go after somebody in
[2:27:42.920 --> 2:27:47.960]  the middle east which makes me wonder if it's all a neocon ploy and a lot of people are questioned
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:52.040]  it's even people that i don't even think would even consider themselves conspiracy theorists
[2:27:52.040 --> 2:27:58.520]  are actually contemplating this as to what's going on exactly last night oh and shroyer went down
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:02.520]  so it's on informers dot com we should take the x service and really make a featured video out of it
[2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:06.520]  he went down to an anti uh you know war rally and there were a bunch of there were more trump
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:11.320]  supporters there protesting the war than the little than the left i mean trump supporters are pissed
[2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:17.000]  yeah well it's because you know you have a president who obviously is used to restrain
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:20.520]  more of a peace president i have a lot of people who are always not a peace president but he has been
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:25.960]  he hasn't wanted to go to war in fact he'd rather negotiate to go to war uh has all of a sudden
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:30.520]  decided well now i'm going to do this and of course he can be told what to say he can get
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:35.960]  him to say whatever he wants to say but i have a feeling that what happened was that the brass
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:42.440]  decided that he were going to uh do something uh and give him some choices and when they gave him
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:47.800]  the choices uh he chose that that's right clad lewis i'm glad you bring up virginia that's something
[2:28:47.800 --> 2:28:51.880]  that i've been blocking out of my mind i'm so worried about it we need to talk about civil war
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:58.120]  stay with us if you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs listen to me you don't
[2:28:58.120 --> 2:29:03.720]  know me and we'll never meet i had a problem like you once i drank and used to party a little too
[2:29:03.720 --> 2:29:10.920]  much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life i realized i needed help to fix my problem
[2:29:10.920 --> 2:29:16.600]  before it totally destroyed me if you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:23.320]  you can't do it alone you need to call the national treatment advisors they'll immerse you into a 30
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:29.000]  day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life and if you

[2:29:50.600 --> 2:29:59.640]  6740 it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know
[2:29:59.640 --> 2:30:06.200]  so everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu
[2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:12.440]  have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu
[2:30:13.160 --> 2:30:21.480]  of their life but still like concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies
[2:30:21.480 --> 2:30:26.680]  and clinics to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in
[2:30:26.680 --> 2:30:31.960]  canada and europe show that when you take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the
[2:30:31.960 --> 2:30:37.960]  flu the next season by lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments
[2:30:37.960 --> 2:30:45.160]  have never guessed the next year's mutation that the flu vaccine has never ever even worked
[2:30:45.160 --> 2:30:50.600]  but how do you prop up a hoax you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst
[2:30:50.600 --> 2:30:57.160]  flu ceases on record happening right now you want to break some globalist ribs you want to crush
[2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:02.200]  some skulls politically you want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually there's
[2:31:02.200 --> 2:31:08.520]  nowhere you can spend money there's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's
[2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:14.840]  going to have more power per dollar your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great
[2:31:14.840 --> 2:31:21.160]  prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to
[2:31:21.160 --> 2:31:26.360]  the enemy and so it's very simple if you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight
[2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:32.360]  taken to the enemy which god wants to see you see we have to make the effort 110 god will finish the
[2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:37.880]  move and i know i need to stay in the fight in the attack attack attack i want to attack i want to
[2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:41.640]  go after the globalists and just believe me ladies and gentlemen that if you want somebody to commit

[2:32:53.400 --> 2:33:09.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:11.800 --> 2:33:18.200]  mapping the global future a 2004 study of 2020 what the intelligence analyst predicted
[2:33:18.200 --> 2:33:23.480]  and how the founding fathers warned us about hyper partisanship to bring about despotism
[2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:29.560]  and civil war that's what line lewis wrote the one of those few talk show hosts that when i'm
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:32.760]  sitting there on the show and he's talking for five minutes before he goes to me because i do the
[2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:36.520]  same thing where i'll have my facts and i can go the other host and hear what they have to say
[2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:41.960]  i'm actually interested uh because he knows what he's talking about and i've done so much research
[2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:45.880]  but i forget a lot of it and he'll bring up a government document or legislation or a statement
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:50.440]  i'm like oh i forgot about that 20 years ago and what i like is folks that have good memories
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:56.440]  and then can tie it in congruently to the larger global plan and who the different factors are now
[2:33:57.640 --> 2:34:01.560]  this virginia thing is so out of control and so big that
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:11.160]  i actually makes my heart pitter pat which most stuff doesn't you've got the democrats in the deep
[2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:16.440]  state the governor saying we keep babies alive and then the black flip face is released and and
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:21.320]  then you've got they're trying to shut down the gun stores and the and the and any type of self
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:26.760]  defense training and they have bills introduced to shut down the shooting ranges they have one
[2:34:26.760 --> 2:34:31.560]  specifically to shut down the nra the way it's tailored so they're they're really trying to start
[2:34:31.560 --> 2:34:36.280]  a fight and then clearly they hired all these former obama people who had just worked for obama
[2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:40.920]  in illyria a year before four of the five white supremacist leaders in charlottesville were like
[2:34:40.920 --> 2:34:46.600]  democrats before so oh they've now turned to nazis completely transparent uh when we're not seeing
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:51.560]  a woman didn't die we're not seeing there weren't crowds on both sides no it but they're organizing
[2:34:51.560 --> 2:34:56.920]  a clash and now with what they're trying to do in virginia and the democrats saying state reps we
[2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:02.760]  want the military to take guns we want the u in the u in unity or had the head of the u in small
[2:35:02.760 --> 2:35:07.800]  arms operation i played the video last week saying no we may have to come to america and take the
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:14.680]  guns and then the u in putting out job applications for that for america that is meant to stoke a
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:19.400]  revolution because we're winning politically we've got an anti-war president at least we did uh
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:23.640]  you know globalism is unpopular so i think what plie louis was getting at you have the floor my
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:27.720]  friend is that they're really trying to start something i'm going to be in virginia this is
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:31.800]  where i'm announcing it not just don't show you're not just savannah hernandez i'm going to be there
[2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:35.560]  i'm going to be at the women's march in dc i'm going to be there on the 20th when the new
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:41.320]  legislature comes in in the commonwealth and where they're promising you know gun confiscation
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:45.960]  and registration i'm going to be there preaching peace and justice and freedom and even if they
[2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:51.400]  can get some of the blue cities to raid and confiscate guns of veterans or something or even
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:56.120]  if they shoot an old veteran down i'm not being a coward here i'm saying hold your powder like gondy
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:02.600]  did we don't want a shooting war because they're going to try to start something and if they just
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:07.160]  like they attack the embassy and we didn't attack back it made iran look bad i and i don't want i'm
[2:36:07.160 --> 2:36:11.320]  not saying i'm not saying let them kill old veterans but they're i think they're they're
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:15.000]  clearly going to try to start something to get a shooting war going and i don't want to take the
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:21.480]  bay so how do you walk that line clad lewis and uh is that what you're getting at well i would say
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:27.240]  that history is certainly a storyteller a big storyteller we gotta look at the cryodynamics
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:31.560]  or clinic dynamics so i guess that's what we call them it was back in history looking human behavior
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:36.760]  the founding fathers and the framers knew this was going to happen they knew that if hyper partisanship
[2:36:36.760 --> 2:36:41.640]  was to take over i mean you look back in the 1960s all the way through the 1990s it was almost like
[2:36:42.840 --> 2:36:48.840]  four parties not just uh two we had uh of course we had conservative uh democrats we had
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:55.640]  liberal democrats we had uh liberal uh liberal republicans we had conservative republicans
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:36:59.880]  but now it's been divided into two parties and the two parties are basically becoming sick of
[2:36:59.880 --> 2:37:03.720]  fans for whoever is there leading them and listening to them and they don't look at the
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:09.400]  corruption that's going on that it's happening with both parties i mean it's interesting how we
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:15.560]  can all jump up and down scrimmellon and and uh and uh you know have this enraged manufactured
[2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:19.800]  anger over donald trump but they don't look at the other corruptions going on on the other side
[2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:25.960]  with that and ship and others uh i can tell you now that the way this is going if they're gonna
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:31.480]  raise uh more or at least try to find other articles and impeachment against the president
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:37.880]  uh they're going to uh the house is going to come after president trump for what happened
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:46.440]  and uh recently with uh salamani and it's like we are at war i mean we're not only a war in
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:51.240]  our in our government between the parties but we're at war with what's going on in virginia
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:56.360]  right now and it's because of the fact that this hyper partisanship hyper partisanship will create
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:03.160]  civil war in this country if we don't stop and we don't and the reason the founders knew that is
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.000]  they their families had all fled from the civil wars that had killed millions dozens of these damn
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:13.800]  wars uh right before the founding of this country people were fleeing to get away from the civil
[2:38:13.800 --> 2:38:20.920]  wars that were happening in england yeah i mean it's like you know they knew they didn't want
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:26.120]  the two-party system uh they warned of a two-party system and it was basically
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:33.320]  washington and adams that came forward and they said if consistent partisan majorities ever take over
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:38.680]  the united states they will control the government and it will use its power to oppress the minority
[2:38:38.680 --> 2:38:45.800]  the republic will fall there's no doubt and here's the thing if we continue to go after the president
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:52.120]  if we continue to have the division within our own government there will be entities outside of
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:59.080]  this country that will see us as being ungovernable okay and that's what sascon's coming in and again
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:02.120]  and i don't want to get the party system like i'm the guy says escape well for a paradigm we
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:06.040]  had a populist revolution via trump if we could reform things through there that's great but
[2:39:06.040 --> 2:39:11.480]  absolutely but the democrats are becoming like foaming at the mouth psychotic piranhas and
[2:39:11.480 --> 2:39:17.400]  they're on the chai-com payroll is that what you're getting at well yeah i mean look it's obvious
[2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:24.920]  that they're recruiting uh people of the un to disarm demobilize and also put people in detainment
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:31.160]  camps rex 2020 is going to happen if we don't watch what we're doing and what i mean by that is
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:36.040]  rex 84 ready exercise 84 where they were going to round up people anyway back with the reggae
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:40.360]  administration uh it's you i mean oliver north was involved with this a bunch of people were
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:44.840]  involved with this and we all know what rex 84 is i mean back 12 years ago we were talking about
[2:39:44.840 --> 2:39:49.800]  the femur camps well guess what guys those femur camps are still in existence they haven't gone
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:54.840]  anywhere and they're just waiting to be filled and all we need is we need just a few traumatic
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:59.640]  events happening in this country where you can't trust anyone you can't trust your politician
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:04.760]  you can't trust your neighbor and if that's the case if we're at that point where we can't trust
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:10.440]  anybody the whole area seen as criminal then another group will step in like the un or other groups
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:14.840]  and they will say the united states has been declared ungovernable we're going to start rounding people
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:19.880]  up everybody round up the dissidents and those we're not going to go by our rule globalization
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:26.600]  is ubiquitous they had a plan and uh and i was talking about the uh national intelligence council
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:32.280]  had a plan called mapping the global future this was back in 2004 they had stated a guy by
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:37.080]  the name of matthew boroson stated that the united states their forms of government when he wrote to
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:42.200]  the point where we would fall to despotism based on what the founding fathers and the favor said
[2:40:42.200 --> 2:40:48.200]  hyperpartisan okay being hyperpartisan is what was going to do this and intelligence officials
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:51.960]  were actually and get all this they were actually talking about how america would have
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:57.240]  wrote so badly and they actually said that in 2020 there'd be a woman president get all this
[2:40:57.240 --> 2:41:04.120]  and that she would have to struggle to quote make america great again that's right so they
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:09.800]  have scripting battle plans no you're absolutely right and then now they're trying to bring back
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:15.400]  all those rec 84 plans who do you think the different factions are because we know there's two parties
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:20.200]  but there's really just the globalist neocons and the leftist uh globalist working together in my
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:25.400]  view and and and i think people realize a populist movement is the way to go but and populism is
[2:41:25.400 --> 2:41:30.600]  spreading all over the world but these stay behind networks inside government are just still embedded
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:35.560]  creating crises well it's interesting about mapping the global future when they were talking
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:40.520]  about this in 2004 what they're really surprised about is they were believing that populism and
[2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:46.680]  nationalism would take place but only in asian and latin american countries they didn't expect
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:53.000]  brexit they didn't expect uh the united states they didn't expect donald trump okay but they did
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:59.480]  have an idea uh that there would also be within the middle east a fanatic organization that would
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:06.040]  certainly uh they would radicalize a lot of young muslims who actually joined up and just
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:09.640]  start destroying everything so you look at the intelligence council and what they're behind
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:14.440]  they predicted it'd be an upsurge in pop populism and nationalism in 2020 but they were like saying
[2:42:14.440 --> 2:42:21.400]  well look you know america is getting tired of being uh the world's police force and so they're
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:27.400]  tired of shouldering the burden of securing allies especially those who think the packs americana is
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:32.520]  nonsense and it's funny because donald trump says the same thing well why are we allowing this to
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:38.600]  happen why are we being abused america is getting a rotten deal uh and and you know it's all if you
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:45.560]  read the plan it is a threat assessment for 2020 it is a goal for 2020 and beyond that we look at
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:51.560]  threat assessments with what ria stay there we're gonna come right back with you people should check
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:43:00.200]  out his website knock on wood i am not tempting fate but everybody around the office especially

[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:15.000]  say that again because i am superstitious when it comes down to that very thankful the good lord

[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:08.920]  clad in the time we have left today what is your gut level prediction for how trump's
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:13.400]  going to end it you know i felt like he was pretty much had that aura of invincibility about him
[2:48:13.400 --> 2:48:18.280]  because all the charges against him were fake and everything they tried failed and he was and he
[2:48:18.280 --> 2:48:25.880]  was anti-war in 2003 and he was now i i think i feel like you know it's it's kind of like cotton
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:33.400]  candy energy uh you get a sugar spike but it but it goes away quickly uh it just it's really hurting
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:37.800]  him with a lot of his real base and i understand we're going to be in some war sometimes we're
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:43.240]  going to have some problems but uh i i just really fear for the president i see biden saying oh
[2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:47.880]  i'm running on charlottesville they want to relaunch charlottesville coming up here in like 13
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:51.960]  days or hoping for clashes that's why i'm going there to call for peace and and you can just
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:57.800]  really i think it's slow motion see what they're going to pull here yeah i can tell you this you
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:04.680]  know with the way we are right now in this country we do not know the good guys from the bad guys
[2:49:04.680 --> 2:49:10.200]  and that's bad and i what i mean by that is is that even at home we don't know who the good guys
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:14.760]  or the bad guys are we know that the person we don't agree with is the bad guy and that's not
[2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:19.480]  very good let me read you what george washington had to say this farewell address he said the
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:25.880]  alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:30.280]  dissension which is different ages of different countries has perpetrated the most horrid
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:37.640]  enormities in and itself is frightful despotism we are right now in a form of despotism that is
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:44.360]  breaking the republic donald trump has no control over how this is going to turn out
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:49.480]  we have to do watch and wait now with what the response may be from iran with regard to solemn
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:55.000]  he's uh dashed i think that right now though we're gonna hear a lot of saber rattling and a lot of
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:50:01.640]  other things i think the house is going to uh pull a move against trump with regard to what
[2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:07.640]  happened in the middle east it's going to cause more division it's going to cause more anger uh and
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:12.200]  like i said more papers of impeachment they're going to be filing more papers of impeachment
[2:50:12.200 --> 2:50:17.720]  we've got a number of people they're going to be going to trial here uh soon they're
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:23.320]  totally going to try and and bring down president trump because of the fact that he has been
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:30.200]  very isolationist he's been very uh pacifist in a situation they don't like the pacifism
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:34.040]  you've got the neocons i mean look at how many times pom payo speaks over the president pom
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:41.960]  payo is on tv speaking i'm sure that uh uh you know tom bolton is in the background also
[2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:46.280]  you know getting a big chubb over the what happened in the middle east i mean any american
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:51.960]  people are divided uh they need to realize that whatever they hear from the media now is just
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:57.000]  stories it's not a way to prove or make an opinion on any i was about to say claud i don't want to
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:01.080]  bring myself into this but you're a smart guy on media i really want to ask you they said i lost a
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:05.560]  lawsuit called nobody died at sandy hook for a book i didn't write i didn't lose that lawsuit
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:11.560]  then they put out fake news stories uh that i lost a court case when they exaggerated like a year and
[2:51:11.560 --> 2:51:15.720]  a half of court filings and i actually wasn't fined a hundred thousand dollars they just said
[2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:19.960]  if i ever lost the case i might have to pay court fees because i filed something that's how that
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:25.000]  works but they're just playing these and they put it on every channel on new year's eve
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:29.080]  like they were invading a country and i talked to a former high level cia guy on air and he said
[2:51:29.080 --> 2:51:34.440]  yeah that's operation mockingbird well well of course it is when every channel i mean i got
[2:51:34.440 --> 2:51:38.760]  crew here that's you know got it on their hip hop alerts i got people that are on tennis groups
[2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:45.080]  apple news put it out why would they on every channel say that i lost a sandy hook lawsuit
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:49.560]  and why are they trying to make that my identity when i never even talk about it hardly because
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:53.000]  that's where the media operates if they find somebody they want to target they target them
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:56.600]  like look at richard jewel i mean we saw that movie richard jewel you saw what happened to richard
[2:51:56.600 --> 2:52:02.520]  jewel uh you know you look at there are several uh movies right now they're out they're trying to
[2:52:02.520 --> 2:52:08.760]  skewer the media some praise the media but right now we're in a situation where uh it's like chemotherapy
[2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:13.960]  they see Donald trump as a cancer so therefore they're going to poison the world with all the media
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:20.040]  they see people they target people as as cancers they say well they don't speak our uh message so
[2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:26.040]  we're going to target them i mean right now i've got what 100 000 maybe more followers on my facebook
[2:52:26.040 --> 2:52:31.160]  page do you realize that my newsfeed doesn't even get out to maybe five people and it's because of
[2:52:31.160 --> 2:52:37.160]  the fact i've been shadow banned i i'm frustrated about this because they just put out a uh was the
[2:52:37.160 --> 2:52:44.760]  talkstream live uh tally of three million people sampled we are now the number five most listened
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:50.680]  to radio show on the internet right now and yet i'm not getting the response i'd like to get because
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:56.040]  i'm being blocked oh no when you're popular when you're popular is when they shadow ban you clad i
[2:52:56.040 --> 2:53:02.040]  mean welcome to the club here look at this u.s repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:07.000]  now that's eight years old okay but the point is is that that's what they're doing and they have a
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:12.200]  Pompeo is running groups in the state department that are attacking trump and trump doesn't even know
[2:53:12.200 --> 2:53:17.640]  this i remember the time we were neck and neck in that poll you and i both we were neck and neck
[2:53:17.640 --> 2:53:22.520]  in that poll we were below the big money people like rosh and shon and all these people but you
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:27.160]  and i were neck and neck ever since they went after you you dropped i rose i'm now i'm gonna
[2:53:27.160 --> 2:53:32.600]  probably take the hit get a few probably as more people know who i am i'm i i'm coming up the ranks
[2:53:32.600 --> 2:53:37.480]  i've been at this now for about 25 years what's sitting back was my sicknesses that i had now
[2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:43.480]  i'm back on track again doing what i'm doing and i'm just waiting uh for you know someone to kick
[2:53:43.480 --> 2:53:48.600]  me what where it hurts so that i can feel the same pain and i hope that doesn't happen and i
[2:53:48.600 --> 2:53:52.760]  haven't heard it for years the local station as well clad you're calling for unity you're calling
[2:53:52.760 --> 2:53:56.440]  for you're like a classical liberals what i would call you don't like labels but like a classical
[2:53:56.440 --> 2:54:01.800]  liberals like let's all get along everybody has speech hey let's not be a partisan thing uh but
[2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:07.080]  now uh again i mean i know even when you have me on facebook shadow bans you even more this
[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:12.600]  is the control and it's so scary and i think they use hyper polarized people like myself
[2:54:12.600 --> 2:54:19.080]  when the media straw manned me as a lightning rod to get the left used to being authoritarian and
[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:24.760]  censoring they're using a developed by conspiracy theory but you're like me you're an analyst you
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:31.480]  analyze conspiracy theory i think they i don't understand that you know uh everybody even police
[2:54:31.480 --> 2:54:37.240]  officers and other people uh indulge in what is known as theory or hypothesis you have to
[2:54:37.240 --> 2:54:42.920]  war game stuff and then and then we'll question all sides they'll cherry pick that of one little
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:47.800]  devil's advocate discussion we have and say that's our view and it's not you call it an info
[2:54:47.800 --> 2:54:54.120]  i call it framing war and that's what it is explain framing wars because that's what they call it
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:00.520]  yeah framing war is where you have different factions trying to frame the narrative in a way
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:04.840]  that becomes an echo chamber for those who have biases and and the trouble is is people don't
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:08.760]  understand some of the biggest commentators that are on the news right now are not journalists
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:15.000]  they're basically commentators they give opinion and and like i said in 2020 we need to look at
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:21.640]  all of these things we hear the things we read as just stories they should never be used to form
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:27.720]  an opinion they should be used as something to consider and from there if you if you find more
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:32.440]  information that gives you precedent that makes you feel like this is something you need to move
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:37.560]  forward to i mean you and i anymore have trepidation with regard to some of the things i report but
[2:55:37.560 --> 2:55:42.440]  lately though i've been going back to analysis lately though i've been going back to these old
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:48.840]  documents that the government themselves have put out for threat assessment analysis they look at
[2:55:48.840 --> 2:55:53.400]  the american people they look at the popular populist nationalist movements and the hyper
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:59.640]  partisanship as an ungovernable scenario where we push ourselves into despotism and a foreign body
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:06.120]  will then come in and bring order to everything which would include gun taking maybe uh the
[2:56:06.120 --> 2:56:09.880]  throwing president maybe the throwing local government you don't know what they're gonna do
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:14.840]  but they're gonna do something and in closing please come back again soon to flesh this out more
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:19.720]  in a framing war look at how google and others in the last decade put people into echo chambers on
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:27.720]  purpose to make us dial down with blinders on so we wouldn't communicate with others they radicalized
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:33.480]  everyone on purpose to vulcanize us so that governmental report says oh look out for vulcanization
[2:56:33.480 --> 2:56:38.680]  look out for ultra partisanship but meanwhile other powerful forces in government and media
[2:56:38.680 --> 2:56:42.840]  have been working to do just that and now we see the fruits of it we're on the verge of physical
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:51.880]  civil war they are not at all ashamed to put cia agents in the seats that are speaking to you from
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:57.080]  the networks keep that in mind you have people like brevin and others who are there and they are
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:57:03.000]  known cia operatives that are giving you that information plus you understand the algorithm
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:09.400]  situation algorithms are going to push you to actually support all the garks in the asylum
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:13.800]  and this is what is happening in this country are you going to leave it up to the cia in a deep
[2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:18.200]  state giving you news and information are you going to leave it up to algorithms who don't care
[2:57:18.200 --> 2:57:22.920]  where you go because they're computers and and the ai is saying over making choices for you
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:27.320]  we need to understand that we've got to think outside the algorithms and we've got to consider
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:34.840]  stories not use them as opinion and not quote what what these fox news cnn or msnbc talk about
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:39.400]  this five more minutes wait a minute we got a little break for two minutes we're gonna be back
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:44.760]  claud Lewis is in fuego right now paul watson coming up to i want to talk about super silver
[2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:49.160]  whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and
[2:57:50.040 --> 2:57:53.960]  i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:58.040]  just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and oh so here i am telling
[2:57:58.040 --> 2:58:04.520]  people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm
[2:58:04.520 --> 2:58:09.720]  45 years old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the
[2:58:09.720 --> 2:58:14.120]  big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth
[2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:19.560]  with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i
[2:58:19.560 --> 2:58:25.560]  brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:31.560]  my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:49.320]  a day now because i like the way it feels in the year 2020 crazed leftists are literally crawling
[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:55.800]  out of their political graves and attacking americans that dare not submit to their bullying

[3:00:03.880 --> 3:00:07.720]  why mullis brought up this important report that i covered back in 2004
[3:00:07.720 --> 3:00:14.600]  cfr globalist funded n i c national intelligence council predicted everything that's happening
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:19.400]  now well that's because they're programming a lot of it ladies and gentlemen and it breaks down how
[3:00:19.400 --> 3:00:25.240]  they bring us into two-party gang warfare and the collapse of america and the takeover by foreign
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:31.640]  powers led by the united nations they've got all these video games and tv shows about if they had
[3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:36.840]  the outgoing head of the justice department loretta lynch with strong city's initiative calling
[3:00:36.840 --> 3:00:42.600]  for it we've got the un small arms uh group head saying let's disarm americans you got bed to our
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:48.200]  work saying hell yes we'll take your ar 15's in summation how important is this report and and
[3:00:48.200 --> 3:00:53.400]  how do americans in just a minute and a half clad uh stop this call clad lewis clad lewis
[3:00:55.160 --> 3:01:00.600]  it's just one more uh i think uh arrow and the quiver in my opinion i mean if you're if you're
[3:01:00.600 --> 3:01:06.440]  doing research which i do every day you find these things you talk about these things and you try to
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:12.520]  present them and say look either it's a blueprint or they got really good at guessing 15 years ago
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:16.840]  i i think it's a blueprint and there's also other threat assessments i mean this was from the council
[3:01:16.840 --> 3:01:20.760]  on foreign relations but other threat assessments that have been presented by other groups and other
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:26.280]  think tanks that have been behind the scenes basically dictating uh policies i mean if you look
[3:01:26.280 --> 3:01:31.160]  at the project for the new american century what that deals with read up on that uh but
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:36.840]  matthew burrows is the author of mapping the global future and of course it was put out uh 2004
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:41.240]  you read it over and you think wow this is like a blueprint either i mean some of the things they
[3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:45.400]  got wrong there's a lot of things they implemented just like uh another one the report on iron
[3:01:45.400 --> 3:01:49.080]  mountain that's another one you need to read too which many people have said either as a hoax or
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:53.240]  whatever i don't think so i think that they wanted to discredit these things because they don't want
[3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:57.640]  the people to have a one up on these planners and what they want to do i mean if you can get a one
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:02.280]  up on them you know how it's going to go you look at the histories you look at human behavior you
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:06.920]  look at the uh what the founding fathers of the framer said hyper partisanship is going to bring
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:12.520]  despotism and civil war to this country and you have to be prepared for this you have to understand
[3:02:12.520 --> 3:02:17.720]  this so that you won't be surprised when this happens and believe me i've lived in a civil war
[3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:22.360]  before south america you're not going to even realize you're in the middle of a civil war until
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:28.360]  one day you hear about the whole town's being shut down because of uh government in the area
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:33.960]  or riots in the area or i mean look at the body count figure it out we are we are asleep walking
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:39.400]  into a globalist orchestrated destabilization of the country we must come together and say no to it
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:46.760]  round zero media dot org clad lewis thank you so much you bet thank you all right folks paul

[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:17.800]  old and i've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:22.840]  the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:27.720]  so clean and the toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with
[3:04:27.720 --> 3:04:33.960]  this it feels so good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:39.720]  i i find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now

[3:05:21.320 --> 3:05:26.360]  surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical

[3:05:59.560 --> 3:06:03.800]  it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:06:03.800 --> 3:06:13.000]  we are live and we are asking the questions that are not only not being asked by the mainstream
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:19.560]  media they're not even being mentioned in terms of what is going on with the horrendous australian
[3:06:19.560 --> 3:06:24.120]  bushfires of course they've been raging for months they've gotten particularly bad in the past few
[3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:30.600]  weeks and there's been a deluge of not just disinformation but outright blacklisting of
[3:06:30.600 --> 3:06:34.840]  the true causes behind those fires they're talking about half a billion animals dead
[3:06:35.880 --> 3:06:40.840]  18 people killed at least millions of hectares of land destroyed thousands and thousands of
[3:06:40.840 --> 3:06:48.520]  homes destroyed but if you watch the golden globes on sunday night and uh the speech of uh
[3:06:48.520 --> 3:06:55.400]  who is it russell crow read out by jennifer aniston the problem the cause is solely climate
[3:06:55.400 --> 3:07:01.800]  change and the solution is higher tax prices the solution is carbon taxes the solution is you
[3:07:01.800 --> 3:07:06.920]  altering your life of course they'll continue as in the case of leonardo de caprio to take
[3:07:06.920 --> 3:07:11.400]  private jets to pick up environmental awards you on the other hand you're going to be hit
[3:07:11.400 --> 3:07:17.880]  with the bill now they're not only not talking about it the real reasons behind the bushfires
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:22.680]  which is not climate change you'll be surprised to know they're not asking the follow-up question
[3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:27.960]  who is behind the bushfires and that is a question that we are going to ask
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:33.480]  here in the next couple of segments gonna debut that video which went up a couple of hours ago
[3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:40.360]  the truth about the australian bushfires so we're gonna get into that gonna get into facebook
[3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:45.800]  saying that they will ban quote deep fake videos in anticipation of the election of course that's
[3:07:45.800 --> 3:07:54.280]  a completely open vague term they claimed that i posted a video about uh jim acosta cnn
[3:07:54.280 --> 3:08:03.000]  reporters swatting away a an aid or a whiteout staffers arm back in november of 2018 of course
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:09.080]  that was not an edited video but the mainstream media had a stampede of disinformation they all
[3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:15.560]  said in unison yes you edited this video even though i didn't and that became a kind of deep
[3:08:15.560 --> 3:08:20.440]  fake video so of course they're gonna completely abuse that term to ban and censor more content and
[3:08:20.440 --> 3:08:28.680]  to ban and censor memes which instagram instagram of course is already doing so we're gonna get
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:34.280]  into that first i want to get into what's happening with the latest with iran because again i've made
[3:08:34.280 --> 3:08:41.320]  this point in my video world war cringe and i think it's a alex has made similar points
[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:48.280]  it is possible to oppose escalation with iran it is possible to oppose wider middle eastern
[3:08:48.280 --> 3:08:55.320]  intervention without literally siding with a terrorist commander in a casem solomani which
[3:08:55.320 --> 3:09:01.160]  is now what the democrats appear to be doing in fact if he was still alive and if he had american
[3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:07.240]  citizenship he'd probably be up on the next debate stage running for office because they love him so
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:15.080]  much i mean you had ilhan omar saying 9 11 with some people did something but she was outraged
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:20.920]  about the killing of casem solomani that apparently was way more outrageous than 9 11 to her now we
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:26.920]  have this headline out of breitbart michael moore in farsi apologizes to iran for airstrike that
[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:33.240]  killed casem solomani left-wing documentary filmmaker michael moore has apologized to iran
[3:09:33.240 --> 3:09:40.200]  on behalf of the american people now which american people that is remains to be seen because a lot
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:45.320]  less american people have been going to see his recent documentaries over the past few years
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:50.520]  because most of them have completely tanked so who he's talking about in terms of representing
[3:09:50.520 --> 3:09:56.600]  the american people that seems like a dwindling population of people but he's saying that he's
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:03.080]  sorry for the recent airstrike ordered by president donald trump that killed general casem solomani
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:09.240]  the democrats knew mass scott and leader apparently he also pleaded with the ayatollah
[3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:15.080]  the president of iran to refrain from acts of vengeance asking them instead to allow the american
[3:10:15.080 --> 3:10:21.320]  people to vote president trump out of office he's literally begging on twitter in farsi for them not
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:28.760]  to do anything please don't hurt us absolutely pathetic no matter what you think about the
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:36.040]  wise and wherefore is the sanity of escalation with iran this is absolutely pathetic this is one
[3:10:36.040 --> 3:10:42.760]  step beyond what rose mcgowan said a few days ago the bowling for columbine fahrenheit 9 11
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:49.400]  director two movies that people actually went and saw unlike his recent ones which nobody
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:53.800]  gives a damn about posted the tweet in farsi on monday expressing regret
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:57.320]  for the airstrike that took place friday while also insulting president trump
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:08.200]  again this is a guy who committed atrocities on a par with al bag daddy like it's as if
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:13.800]  michael moor tweeted to isis to apologize for trump ordering the assassination of bag daddy
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:19.640]  it's on the same level just because solomani committed his terrorist atrocities commanded
[3:11:19.640 --> 3:11:27.560]  his terrorist army under the auspices of a state doesn't make it okay this is what he said i deeply
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:32.120]  regret the violence committed on our behalf by a man that most americans never voted for
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:38.280]  he literally said this on twitter he also posted an instagram message in farsi
[3:11:38.280 --> 3:11:42.520]  in which he begged the ayatollah and the president of iran to allow the american people to remove
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:47.480]  president trump from office in a peaceful election or through impeachment via the senate first of all
[3:11:47.480 --> 3:11:54.760]  what kind of arrogance does michael moor some fat hypocrite failed documentarian who again nobody
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:12:00.680]  watches his recent stuff variety did an article about it where they outlined how he he was basically
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:05.880]  just tanking and his career was over what kind of arrogance does it take for him to think he
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:12.360]  represents the american people and to think he can reach out to foreign leaders and try and conduct
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:21.240]  diplomacy through twitter when he's a failed fat film director absolutely incredible this is what he
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:27.160]  said on instagram and to say he represents the american people no you don't you know even your
[3:12:27.160 --> 3:12:33.160]  own supporters aren't watching your documentaries the filmmaker began the post by expressing his
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:40.040]  deep condolences he's literally expressing deep consolances because some terrorist commander warlord
[3:12:40.040 --> 3:12:46.840]  was killed this is like saying sorry to isis for killing bagdaddy seriously i want you not to respond
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:53.000]  violently he said but to act bravely instead we will take care of this in our senate or at the
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:13:00.120]  ballot box no you won't non-violently violence only increases violence absolutely pathetic
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:07.800]  and he's been matched almost by bernie sanders headline bernie sanders solomonie striker kin
[3:13:07.800 --> 3:13:14.040]  to putin assassinating dissidents monday on cnn zanders and cooper bernie sanders candidate for
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:18.200]  the democratic presidential nomination likened the trump administration strike against kasem
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:23.080]  solomani the head of iranian revolution regards kudz force to actions taken by russia and china
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:27.800]  against dissidents he specifically mentioned the actions of russian president vladimir putin
[3:13:27.800 --> 3:13:34.040]  were making his comparison he said this guy you know was as bad as he was an official of the iranian
[3:13:34.040 --> 3:13:39.160]  government and you unleash then if china does that you know if russia does that russia has
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:45.800]  been implicated under putin with assassinating dissidents so he's literally again siding with a guy
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:52.360]  and talking about putin assassinating dissidents comparing that to what trump did to solomani
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:59.240]  this is a regime in iran that literally in the space of like three weeks assassinated
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:06.760]  5000 political dissidents this is a regime that killed hundreds of people gun them down on the
[3:14:06.760 --> 3:14:14.200]  streets only last month but trump's bad for assassinating a terrorist commander a terrorist
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:21.960]  warlord the level of absolute just ingratiating genuflecting weakness that we've seen from the
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:29.800]  likes of ilhan oma bernie sanders michael moore just makes your skin crawl similarly you have
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:35.640]  people in the dissident right you know what's left the dregs of the alt right literally putting
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:42.360]  iranian flags in their bios and pleading with iran and saying you know throwing trump under the
[3:14:42.360 --> 3:14:48.200]  bus site come on come on you can oppose escalation you can oppose middle eastern intervention
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:55.640]  that literally putting the flag of a brutal islamic theocracy in your twitter profile
[3:14:55.640 --> 3:15:02.920]  how cringe is that new york times is doing the same thing headline out of daily call in new
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:10.200]  york times paints iran solomani in vaunter terms following trump stride of course we had the new
[3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:17.640]  york times journalist posting a a cope post after solomani was killed exhibiting his poetry he was
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:22.200]  just a humble poet now the new york times has repeatedly peddled iranian propaganda in the
[3:15:22.200 --> 3:15:29.560]  aftermath of the drone strike and basically they're following the same rhetoric they reported in
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:35.880]  iran many saw him as larger than life hero anecdotes about his asceticism it's quiet charisma
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:42.680]  joined to create an image of a warrior philosopher so just the same as they described by daddy the
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:47.800]  washington post as an austere religious scholar the new york times is now worshiping solomani the
[3:15:47.800 --> 3:15:54.440]  terrorist commander no go away we'll be back hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over 40

[3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:03.400]  and i've been beating them ever since i wrote the book on tax debt settlement and i've helped

[3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:27.480]  the united states of empire is a book that claims the united states is the empire of the world

[3:18:51.720 --> 3:18:57.640]  to you it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know
[3:18:58.520 --> 3:19:05.640]  everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken
[3:19:05.640 --> 3:19:11.960]  the flu vaccine right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life
[3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:20.120]  but still like concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics
[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:25.400]  to get the injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada
[3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:30.680]  in europe show that when you take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:36.680]  season by lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never
[3:19:36.680 --> 3:19:43.640]  guessed the next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you
[3:19:43.640 --> 3:19:49.320]  profit by hoax you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:57.960]  record happening right now you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:05.880 --> 3:20:14.120]  you're listening to summit.news with paul joseph watson
[3:20:14.120 --> 3:20:19.560]  we're gonna get straight into this video the truth about the australian bushfires gonna play
[3:20:19.560 --> 3:20:24.440]  that video it's about eight and a half minutes long come back and talk about exactly who is behind
[3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:30.440]  the fires but here's the video the truth about the australian bushfires the australian bushfires
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:36.440]  are horrendous at least 18 people dead thousands of homes destroyed millions of hectares of land
[3:20:36.440 --> 3:20:42.280]  torched half a billion animals burned alive look at this satellite image of the country
[3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:49.000]  it's absolutely terrifying and all because of climate change right make no mistake the tragedy
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:54.280]  unfolding in australia is climate change based wrong for weeks we've been bombarded with this
[3:20:54.280 --> 3:21:00.760]  relentless sustained narrative that man-made global warming caused and exacerbated this disaster
[3:21:00.760 --> 3:21:05.960]  this is the kind of emergency that scientists say is made much more likely and more damaging by climate
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:12.360]  change climate change climate change climate change climate change and it's all total bullshit
[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:18.120]  guess what the primary cause of these fires was people deliberately starting the fires
[3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:22.840]  australian authorities are now working on the premise that quote arson is to blame for much
[3:21:22.840 --> 3:21:28.680]  of the devastation caused this bushfire season firebugs known to be responsible for lighting
[3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:34.040]  deliberately lit fires like this one where the fires intentionally started police have formed
[3:21:34.040 --> 3:21:40.040]  strike force in darah comprising detectives from homicide and arson squads last time i checked people
[3:21:40.040 --> 3:21:46.440]  deliberately starting fires had nothing whatsoever to do with co2 driven planetary climate change
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:21:52.680]  figures obtained by news agency aap show that nearly 200 people across the country have already
[3:21:52.680 --> 3:21:59.640]  been arrested or investigated by police for deliberately starting the fires nearly 200
[3:21:59.640 --> 3:22:06.040]  people identified as having started these fires and probably hundreds more who've not been identified
[3:22:06.040 --> 3:22:13.160]  in queensland police concluded that 103 of the fires had been deliberately lit with 98 people
[3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:20.280]  67 of them juveniles having been identified as the culprits according to dr paul reed co-director
[3:22:20.280 --> 3:22:26.440]  of the national center for research in bushfire and arson around 85 percent of bushfires are
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:32.360]  caused by humans either deliberately or accidentally starting them about 85 percent are related to
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:38.760]  human activity 13 percent confirmed arson and 37 percent suspected arson he said the remainder are
[3:22:38.760 --> 3:22:44.520]  usually due to reckless fire lighting or even just children playing with fire the disaster has also
[3:22:44.520 --> 3:22:49.960]  been made worse by the timing it's the school holidays in australia and many of the firebugs
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:55.480]  are teenagers the other main reason why the fires are raging is because green environmentalist
[3:22:55.480 --> 3:23:01.640]  policies have outlawed property owners doing controlled burns that create fire breaks to
[3:23:01.640 --> 3:23:07.880]  prevent inferno spreading as miranda divine explains governments appeasing the green beast have
[3:23:07.880 --> 3:23:13.160]  ignored numerous state and federal bushfire inquiries over the past decade almost all of
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:19.160]  which have recommended increasing the practice of prescribed burning also known as hazard reduction
[3:23:19.160 --> 3:23:24.520]  it's a methodical regime of burning off flammable ground covering coolamonds in a controlled
[3:23:24.520 --> 3:23:31.800]  fashion so it does not fuel the inevitable summer bushfires i'm here at king creek look at this these
[3:23:31.800 --> 3:23:36.680]  f***ing greenies and the government and these f***ing wombats who don't want to burn s*** off look
[3:23:36.680 --> 3:23:41.640]  at this we're going to lose all our f***ing houses and properties because you useless pieces of f***ing
[3:23:41.640 --> 3:23:47.240]  garbage will not burn off when it's supposed to through the winter time like we used to do years
[3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:52.280]  ago out in the f***ing farms up in the mountains burn all the undergrowth off so everything was safe
[3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:57.400]  but you pricks you want to f***ing have a really good look at this you f***ing wombats look at
[3:23:57.400 --> 3:24:02.760]  the f***ing state you've caused here you are the biggest bunch of useless loser f***ing pieces of
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:07.640]  garbage god ever had the misfortune to blow f***ing breathing things in east gippsland in the state
[3:24:07.640 --> 3:24:14.200]  of victoria protesters successfully stopped one of these controlled burns from happening with one
[3:24:14.200 --> 3:24:19.960]  protester quoted as saying i'm more worried about climate change so because of green policies
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:26.680]  preventing the vital forest management process of clearing areas via controlled reduction burns
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:32.840]  these bushfires have spread far quicker in many parts of australia trees were legally designated
[3:24:32.840 --> 3:24:39.640]  as carbon sinks to offset co2 emissions this made it illegal for australians to fell trees on their
[3:24:39.640 --> 3:24:45.320]  own property to create fire breaks this then aggravated the spread of the bushfires the
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:51.240]  firefighter was fined a hundred thousand dollars for creating a fire break on his own property
[3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:56.920]  and surprise surprise his house was the only one that survived the bushfires in his area because
[3:24:56.920 --> 3:25:02.920]  and i know this is hard to believe fire breaks prevent the spread of fires these environmental
[3:25:02.920 --> 3:25:09.240]  regulations that outlawed the creation of fire breaks worsened the previous australian bushfire
[3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:16.360]  disaster in 2009 they knew this for at least a decade yet the same laws remained in place
[3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:22.120]  thanks to the green lobby so the very same enviro extremists pointing the finger at you and i for
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:29.000]  our carbon emissions exacerbating the bushfires are themselves infinitely more responsible
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:34.280]  for exacerbating the bushfires they're the ones responsible for the half a billion dead animals
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:39.160]  and they've got the nerve to point the finger in the opposite direction data also shows there's
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:45.240]  been no significant decrease in rainfall in the affected regions droughts in the affected regions
[3:25:45.240 --> 3:25:51.720]  were caused by a natural weather phenomenon the indian ocean depoli not by man-made climate change
[3:25:51.720 --> 3:25:57.880]  temperatures haven't been significantly higher either in fact during the years 1899 to 1901
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:04.920]  average december mean maximum temperatures were well above 38 degrees as james deling poll writes
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:10.280]  to be clear there is zero evidence of any change in climatic conditions that might have increased
[3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:17.000]  the likelihood or severity of these bushfires this is not repeat not a man-made climate change
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  story and anyone who claims otherwise is either a gullible idiot or a lying charlatan to emphasize
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:29.160]  the point the two main factors causing and exacerbating the bushfires in australia people
[3:26:29.160 --> 3:26:35.400]  deliberately starting the fires and environmentalist regulations are not even being mentioned never
[3:26:35.400 --> 3:26:42.120]  mind debated in the vast majority of mainstream media reporting on this subject the bbc did a
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:48.680]  12-minute piece about the bushfires and neither of those factors were mentioned once what they did
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:54.520]  mention was the apparent solution to eliminate carbon emissions entirely a process that would
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:27:00.840]  completely devastate the economy and hurt poor people around 50 000 workers in australia are
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:06.280]  connected to the fossil fuel industry and we know that around 60 percent of australia's electricity
[3:27:06.280 --> 3:27:11.720]  comes from coal-fired power stations great let's put thousands of working class people out of work
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:17.320]  let's make fuel prices completely unaffordable for those on low or no incomes let's alienate
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:24.360]  an anger another generation of resentful rural inhabitants left behind by globalism a generation
[3:27:24.360 --> 3:27:29.880]  who are already out on the streets in france germany and holland protesting against these very
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:35.720]  same environmentalist regulations simply to make middle-class virtue signalers feel better about
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:41.480]  themselves as they spew hysterical debunked nonsense about climate change while they lobby for
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:47.960]  green policies that actually make bushfires worse great idea and listen i know it's very easy to be
[3:27:47.960 --> 3:27:53.960]  emotionally manipulated by images of burned koalas and dead baby kangaroos lulled into
[3:27:53.960 --> 3:28:00.200]  believing that if you just give your masters more power to tax more power to regulate more power to
[3:28:00.200 --> 3:28:06.520]  control that they can make it all go away but they can't make human stupidity and the sheer
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:12.520]  awesome force of mother nature ever go away and they're lying to you when are we gonna stop listening
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:18.360]  to these people they've been caught lying time and time again whether it be the experts who told us
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:23.800]  at the end of the 70s that a new ice age was coming paul earlick's prediction that hundreds of
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:30.840]  millions of people would die of starvation due to crop failure by the 1980s or the 2004 prediction
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:36.280]  that major european cities would be underwater and that britain would be plunged into a Siberian
[3:28:36.280 --> 3:28:43.720]  climate by 2020 or al gozdoomsday warning that the arctic would have ice-free summers by 2013
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:49.720]  none of it happened and yet now a certain teenage climate activist who is beyond question

[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:11.640]  frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like
[3:32:11.640 --> 3:32:18.440]  this and to know that most americans have already been silenced in cyberspace that most americans
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:24.680]  have already been shadow banned by big tech and to know that most americans feel powerless and don't
[3:32:24.680 --> 3:32:32.120]  realize how much power they have by spreading the word about news wars dot com info wars dot
[3:32:32.120 --> 3:32:36.840]  com and band on video and that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever and then if you
[3:32:36.840 --> 3:32:43.080]  tell people hey the band truth they don't want you to have is it info wars dot com forward slash show
[3:32:43.080 --> 3:32:48.280]  in band on video so take heart folks they've had to censor everybody and show everybody down
[3:32:48.280 --> 3:32:57.080]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square you're listening to the alex
[3:32:57.080 --> 3:33:11.960]  jones show transmitting worldwide from the summit dot news studios in the united kingdom you're
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:22.840]  listening to her joseph watson fires have been absolutely cataclysmic but of course the narrative
[3:33:22.840 --> 3:33:29.400]  stampede is completely centered around climate change even though the people responsible for
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:37.000]  those bushfires spreading were green lobbyists after they passed laws in australia preventing
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:43.480]  property owners preventing farmers from creating fire breaks by burning undergrowth by felling
[3:33:43.480 --> 3:33:48.840]  and burning trees to stop the spread of bushfires so again they're pointing the finger at us for
[3:33:48.840 --> 3:33:55.560]  our carbon emissions and they're the ones responsible for these massive bushfires the other people
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:34:00.280]  responsible of course are the people who actually started the fires they've arrested nearly 200
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:05.800]  people across the country but deliberately starting these bushfires there are probably
[3:34:05.800 --> 3:34:12.600]  100 200 more who haven't been caught this is not being discussed by any mainstream media
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:18.520]  network that i've seen so of course the next question to ask who is starting these bushfires
[3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:27.000]  well of course we had another fire last year at the notched am cathedral which of course as we know
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:32.040]  was completely an accident it was totally an accident it wasn't started deliberately
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:39.000]  you can believe them and it brings me back to this headline out of summit news which is
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:44.520]  buzzfeed core in huge light about notched am fire now of course they tried to spin it
[3:34:45.720 --> 3:34:50.520]  that we had started this conspiracy theory that the fire at notched am had been started
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:56.040]  deliberately that was a reporter on the scene who said that we reported on his comments but
[3:34:56.040 --> 3:35:04.440]  then oh no it was our fault then they completely lied by claiming that certain people from a
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:11.720]  certain demographic were not celebrating the notched am fire even though as it was happening
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:17.960]  and the headline is buzzfeed core in huge lie about notched am fire as it was happening as the
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:24.360]  cathedral was burning on aljazeera's facebook page on france 24 arabic's facebook page
[3:35:24.360 --> 3:35:31.960]  which post after post common after common were people let's just say of a certain demographic
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:38.040]  with a certain kind of name this is this is france 24 arabic this is aljazeera celebrating the
[3:35:38.040 --> 3:35:46.440]  notched am fire with smiley faces with proclamations of joy and buzzfeed put out an article in the
[3:35:46.440 --> 3:35:51.640]  aftermath of that here are the hoaxes of misinformation about notched am fire info
[3:35:51.640 --> 3:35:56.840]  was contributed paul joseph watson tweeted a link to a video that claims to show muslim people
[3:35:56.840 --> 3:36:02.040]  celebrating the fire this is what buzzfeed said critically the video in question does not show
[3:36:02.040 --> 3:36:10.120]  what people on facebook were reacting to uh yes it did the notched am fire was in the shot that
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:15.160]  was the video you can see it right here in this article if you scroll back up to the top of the
[3:36:15.160 --> 3:36:22.520]  article the tweet was a brief summary of who is responding to the tragic notched am fire with smiley
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:29.720]  faces on facebook if you scroll down to that first tweet it shows if you restart the video there
[3:36:29.720 --> 3:36:35.800]  it shows what they were reacting to right there in the background the notched am cathedral on fire
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:41.720]  so buzzfeed came out and said oh we had no nobody knows what they were reacting to it was a live
[3:36:41.720 --> 3:36:48.200]  feed of the notched am cathedral on fire which they were reacting to with smiley faces so then
[3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:55.000]  buzzfeed comes out and says oh nobody reacted with smiley faces absolute flagrant fake news
[3:36:56.200 --> 3:37:02.600]  and then they did another hoax there was a post and the headline out of arty is the guardian
[3:37:02.600 --> 3:37:11.000]  apologizes for saying sputnik posted fake notched am photo vilifying muslims this was a photo of two
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:18.200]  men from a certain demographic lifting up uh emergency tape police tape and in the background
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:24.680]  you can see the notched am cathedral on fire these two individuals are smiling and laughing the guardian
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:29.560]  buzzfeed all these other news outlets came out immediately and claimed that this photo had been
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:36.760]  faked had been photoshopped sputnik then went and provided the metadata for the photo which wasn't
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:42.200]  even their photo i think they got it from the getty or some other news agency proving that it
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:49.160]  was a real photo showing real individuals smiling as the notched am cathedral burned behind them
[3:37:49.160 --> 3:37:54.600]  and the guardian had to apologize to sputnik for saying that they'd faked that photo when it was a
[3:37:54.600 --> 3:38:01.240]  completely genuine photo so they have a kind of history of lying about who's celebrating these
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:08.680]  suspicious fires let's just put it that way which is not to say that the majority of these fires
[3:38:08.680 --> 3:38:13.640]  or even all of these bushfires in australia were started as i explained in the video in the previous
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:20.520]  segment by fire bugs by teenagers on school holidays they've arrested almost 200 people
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:27.640]  for starting the fires and then james deling poll pointed out in his article today australian police
[3:38:27.640 --> 3:38:35.560]  arrest 180 arsonists for bushfires someone tell russell crow he linked to a tweet which pointed
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:40.920]  out that quote officials in israel has stated that the deliberate setting of fires is a form of
[3:38:40.920 --> 3:38:46.920]  terrorism as of 28th and november at least 25 cases of fires were caused by suspected arsons
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:52.840]  on 13th of january 2017 the israeli fire investigation the gall report found that
[3:38:52.840 --> 3:39:02.840]  80 checked fires 70 out of 80 71 had been a result of arson so we know that this is a method of
[3:39:02.840 --> 3:39:10.360]  terrorism and in fact isis itself came out and said that wildfires were a terrorist technique
[3:39:10.360 --> 3:39:15.880]  were a terrorist weapon they'd line out of the daily mail isis is using wildfire as terror weapon
[3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:20.600]  against its enemies with a group claiming responsibility for arson attacks at scorchland
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:26.920]  in iraq and syria and warning this is just the beginning that article came out in may 2019
[3:39:26.920 --> 3:39:32.520]  and it points out that the terror group says the fires are just the beginning and they branked isis
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:39.640]  that quote tons of crops had been destroyed this was in iraq and syria so we know for a fact that
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:46.200]  terrorists have encouraged and indeed started these very kind of wildfires that's not to say
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:51.560]  that there's any evidence that that's taking place in australia but we have to ask the question
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:57.320]  we know these fires hundreds of them have been deliberately started who is deliberately starting
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:04.840]  the fires now there's an article about out of the daily telegraph in australia headline teen
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:11.080]  accused of lighting fire laughs after court appearance remember i just mentioned the image
[3:40:11.080 --> 3:40:16.760]  image which the guardian claim was fake at the notredam fire the two individuals laughing
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:25.240]  celebrating the fire well they just had a similar thing in australia western sydney teen fadi zrakia
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:30.760]  interesting name one of the two teens accused of lighting a grass fire at gilford park
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:37.560]  while bushfires ravaged new south wales laughed outside court today after appearing on multiple
[3:40:37.560 --> 3:40:45.800]  charges police alleged fadi and abraham zrakia both 18 set of fireworks that sparked a grass fire
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:50.440]  at bright park gilford on december 22nd and then there's a picture of those two individuals
[3:40:50.440 --> 3:40:58.680]  once again they are from a certain demographic now i'm not saying before people clip this out of
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:05.560]  context that any of the bushfires in australia were started by terrorists or people from a certain
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:12.120]  demographic but we know that this is a terror tactic and we know that in two cases two teens
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:16.280]  from that demographic have been arrested and they were pictured laughing about it outside of
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:21.320]  court they were filming the reporters and their mobile phones they found the whole thing very
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:27.880]  funny indeed despite the fact that 18 people are dead half a billion animals are dead the country is
[3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:33.320]  on fire millions of hectares of property have been completely destroyed i would say that that
[3:41:33.320 --> 3:41:39.320]  was not a laughing matter but they found it very funny indeed so we don't know who's starting the
[3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:45.480]  fires obviously it's some of its teens we've seen the numbers mainly juveniles some of its fire books
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:51.800]  adults starting these fires but the fact is people are starting these fires and the fires are
[3:41:51.800 --> 3:41:57.880]  spreading because of environmentalist policies that made it illegal for farmers for landowners in
[3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:05.240]  australia to burn off that undergrowth and to create fire breaks that stop the spread of fires
[3:42:05.240 --> 3:42:10.760]  so the very people screaming climate change and pointing the finger at us to reduce our carbon
[3:42:10.760 --> 3:42:18.360]  emissions are directly responsible for worsening these fires headline app daily caller abc news
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:24.520]  deletes issues correction on misleading tweet depicting australia wildfires they put a map of
[3:42:24.520 --> 3:42:31.960]  australia onto a map of the us and they exaggerated the fires by making them cover the entire area
[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:37.000]  when in fact these fires were individual fires dotted around the coast of the country so we
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:44.120]  have several instances of them again spreading hysteria to heighten the climate change propaganda
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:49.480]  when it's proven that climate change policies were actually responsible for spreading these fires
[3:42:49.480 --> 3:42:56.600]  we'll be back andy in florida thank you andy go ahead hey alex i love you man we love you before i
[3:42:56.600 --> 3:43:00.680]  go ahead and talk about the topic on hand i gotta talk about one of your product a little bit about

[3:43:48.600 --> 3:43:56.440]  let's just get busy m4store.com i keep my eye on the news all the time but i miss the fact that
[3:43:56.440 --> 3:44:07.880]  in late 2019 just about two weeks ago the cdc and the fda approved live ebola vaccine to be given
[3:44:07.880 --> 3:44:15.560]  inside the united states and it is an experimental vaccine it is live it's not even attenuated
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:21.160]  they've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal same stuff they did with
[3:44:21.160 --> 3:44:28.600]  the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many this is just crazy and the congos
[3:44:28.600 --> 3:44:33.560]  had the biggest outbreaks of ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last
[3:44:33.560 --> 3:44:39.160]  few years oh and of course open the borders up here and letting people in un thetted the
[3:44:39.160 --> 3:44:44.840]  democrats distribute across the country you cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity
[3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:49.880]  and it is an attempted ebola assault on america this is the new world order
[3:44:52.600 --> 3:44:59.560]  it's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know everybody
[3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:06.520]  is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine
[3:45:06.520 --> 3:45:13.160]  right before they get it and they get the worst case of the flu of their life but still
[3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:20.440]  like concentration camp victims they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the
[3:45:20.440 --> 3:45:26.040]  injections it doesn't matter that studies mainline government studies in canada in europe show that
[3:45:26.040 --> 3:45:31.320]  when you take the flu vaccine it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by
[3:45:31.320 --> 3:45:37.160]  lowering your immunity it goes on and on or the fact that the governments have never guessed the
[3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:43.720]  next year's mutation at the flu vaccine has never ever even worked but how do you problem
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:49.640]  of hoax you keep the giant hoax going no wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record

[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:49.560]  rt facebook bans deep fakes ahead of us election but vows no collateral damage against satire or
[3:49:49.560 --> 3:49:58.440]  parody videos really well instagram which is owned by facebook we had this article a few weeks ago
[3:49:58.440 --> 3:50:05.080]  they're already fact checking memes and censoring memes we had this headline instagram fact checks
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:11.320]  memes saying hillary killed jeffrey epstein it was obviously humorous and satirical they fact
[3:50:11.320 --> 3:50:15.720]  check and remove the meme they either remove it or you have to click through to another screen to
[3:50:15.720 --> 3:50:21.320]  see it you have to be logged into your account it is a form of soft censorship there was a meme
[3:50:21.320 --> 3:50:28.200]  of bush george w bush saying i killed saddam hussein obama saying i killed usama bin laden
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:34.360]  trump saying i killed abu bakar al-bagdadi and hillary clinton saying i killed jeffrey epstein
[3:50:34.360 --> 3:50:41.640]  it was obviously a joke parody they censored the meme instagram is owned by facebook oh but
[3:50:42.200 --> 3:50:48.280]  facebook's not going to ban satire meme or parody videos and you can trust them facebook has
[3:50:48.280 --> 3:50:53.720]  announced a new policy to tackle machine learning and ai manipulated defect videos on the platform
[3:50:53.720 --> 3:50:58.920]  head of 2020 us presidential election will claim satire and parody videos will be spared
[3:50:58.920 --> 3:51:05.800]  now they won't because you saw what happened with the video of jim acosta swatting away the
[3:51:05.800 --> 3:51:12.840]  arm of that white house staffer during that press conference back in november 2018 when i uploaded
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:20.440]  a video of it to twitter and the media stampede said that i had faked the video and they were
[3:51:20.440 --> 3:51:27.000]  saying why is he still allowed on social media why is this post not being banned this has manipulated
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:33.080]  this is fake this is a deep fake video this should be banned it wasn't edited the video was not
[3:51:33.080 --> 3:51:47.880]  doctored as he saw with trump he actually came out defended me you see it donald trump coming
[3:51:47.880 --> 3:51:53.000]  out and making the exact same point i did which the fact that it was not a doctored video it was
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:58.360]  a gif image uploaded to twitter there was no deliberate doctrine whatsoever you look up the
[3:51:58.360 --> 3:52:04.360]  meaning of doctoring it's a deliberately change video to mislead that was not the case but this
[3:52:04.360 --> 3:52:08.440]  is the slippery slope that they're going to employ oh but they're saying no you can trust them
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:15.640]  they understand satire and parody yeah right every time the babel on b gets a viral article on
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:22.120]  facebook the blue check marks again stampede for it to be censored in fact there's a post here which
[3:52:22.120 --> 3:52:30.680]  i flagged up yesterday by somebody called cindy or tease former cia employee deep state employee
[3:52:30.680 --> 3:52:36.680]  who said quote a post from a satirical website has been shared more than 500 000 times saying the
[3:52:36.680 --> 3:52:41.880]  dnc called for the flag to be a half mast because of solar money some family members just called
[3:52:41.880 --> 3:52:47.320]  because their republican friends on facebook are circulating it like it's legit oh my god panic
[3:52:47.320 --> 3:52:53.160]  we have a lot of work to do yeah here's the work you need to do create some satirical websites to
[3:52:53.160 --> 3:53:01.000]  compete with the babel on b everybody knows the babel on b is a satirical website okay create your
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:06.680]  own satirical websites to compete with it to get viral traction on facebook and then it cancels
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:12.600]  it out oh no but they can't do that can they because they don't have sensors of humor the left
[3:53:12.600 --> 3:53:19.160]  can't mean it's not a cliche it's absolutely true and that's why they want to ban memes
[3:53:20.280 --> 3:53:27.080]  absolutely incredible and on a similar topic headline out of bright bar charlie hebdo marks
[3:53:27.080 --> 3:53:32.360]  five-year terror attack anniversary with internet censorship criticism remember the reason why g
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:38.840]  hadist attacked charlie hebdo cartoonists in january 2015 was because they were offended
[3:53:38.840 --> 3:53:44.680]  at what these cartoonists were publishing and in the five years following that all the social media
[3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:50.600]  giants followed suit by censoring quote offensive content well now to mark the five-year anniversary
[3:53:50.600 --> 3:53:55.640]  of the terror attack that saw 12 people killed satirical publication charlie hebdo has hit out
[3:53:55.640 --> 3:54:02.600]  against social media censorship in a special new issue and if you look at the cover which is in
[3:54:02.600 --> 3:54:09.160]  the article here it's titled new censorship new dictatorships it shows a man with a pencil and
[3:54:09.160 --> 3:54:15.240]  paper being crushed by a mobile phone with the logos of twitter facebook and snapchat again with
[3:54:15.240 --> 3:54:22.760]  the caption new censorship new dictatorships and that is precisely the point kudos to charlie
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:27.480]  hebdo for continuing to stay on this again they were basically you know we had the whole just
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:32.600]  sweet charlie movement immediately after you probably men remember world leaders marching in
[3:54:32.600 --> 3:54:38.120]  the streets of paris hand in hand then then a few months after that it kind of ended very quickly
[3:54:38.120 --> 3:54:43.800]  and it wasn't just sweet charlie it was f charlie and it was oh well they offended some jihadist so
[3:54:43.800 --> 3:54:49.880]  maybe they deserved it you literally had the pope come out and say oh well if somebody punched my
[3:54:49.880 --> 3:54:57.880]  mother in the face i would react literally siding with the jihadist by giving them legitimacy
[3:54:57.880 --> 3:55:02.280]  and saying oh well they if they were offended by charlie hebdo's criticism of islam you know maybe
[3:55:02.280 --> 3:55:07.560]  maybe they deserved it maybe charlie hebdo should have show up about islam absolutely horrific and
[3:55:07.560 --> 3:55:14.840]  it's really odd to think that that was five years ago it seems much closer but charlie hebdo
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:21.720]  still going strong now calling out social media censorship of offensive content five years after
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:29.800]  their officers were attacked by jihadists who were offended by their offensive content now of
[3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:36.040]  course last night during on sunday night sorry during the golden globes we had ricky gervais come
[3:55:36.040 --> 3:55:40.680]  out and say don't get up here and use this as a platform for your dumb political speeches
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:45.960]  and what proceeded to happen numerous celebrities got up and used it as a platform for their dumb
[3:55:45.960 --> 3:55:55.080]  political speeches and we also had michelle williams this is a tweet by lila rose who is found a
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:56:00.120]  president of live action she said michelle williams while visibly pregnant claimed she wouldn't have
[3:56:00.120 --> 3:56:05.160]  won her golden globes award if she didn't kill her previous child that's right she literally
[3:56:05.160 --> 3:56:11.000]  get got up and gave a speech and said thank god for abortion basically if i hadn't have killed
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:18.040]  my child i wouldn't be able to get this little award that was the gist of it absolutely despicable
[3:56:18.040 --> 3:56:23.240]  you're going to hell i hope it's worth your little golden award she said no trophy is worth more than
[3:56:23.240 --> 3:56:28.440]  a child's life she didn't say that well that was a summary of what she said that was basically the
[3:56:28.440 --> 3:56:34.360]  gist of it and lila rose says sacrificing our children to pursue our dreams is a total antithesis
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:38.360]  of women's empowerment but how did the media react to it well here's a headline out of the
[3:56:38.360 --> 3:56:43.400]  federalist media bias vividly illustrated in headlines about michelle williams pro-abortion
[3:56:43.400 --> 3:56:50.200]  golden globe speech what were the headlines as she literally celebrated aborting her kids so she
[3:56:50.200 --> 3:56:56.280]  could she could get ahead in life cnn read michelle williams powerful speech about choice
[3:56:56.840 --> 3:57:02.360]  e-news michelle williams delivers powerful speech about women's rights at the 2020 golden globes
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:07.400]  people michelle williams powerfully champions of women's rights to choose in golden globe speech
[3:57:08.040 --> 3:57:12.680]  so they took a speech by somebody who was literally celebrating the fact that she killed
[3:57:12.680 --> 3:57:19.080]  her baby in order to receive this award and said that that was a powerful message for young women
[3:57:19.080 --> 3:57:24.840]  and we wonder why young women across the west across america are having so few babies and
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:29.800]  their fertility rates continue to plummet while elsewhere in the world they don't seem to be
[3:57:29.800 --> 3:57:35.400]  having the same problems because they're not bombarded with this insane propaganda on a regular
[3:57:35.400 --> 3:57:40.600]  basis that's going to wrap it up war room is coming up next with iwin shroyer don't go away submit
[3:57:40.600 --> 3:58:00.600]  don't use you
