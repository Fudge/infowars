[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:25.760]  Texas Alex Jones hard to believe Ferguson out of Missouri still bubbling
[00:25.760 --> 00:29.840]  with more rioting and state senator getting arrested I've not really been
[00:29.840 --> 00:33.200]  doing my job last few weeks and covering that properly though in force
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.800]  nightly news has been doing that there's a lot of really important mixed Ebola news
[00:38.800 --> 00:43.280]  today some shocking information quite frankly we're gonna be breaking all of
[00:43.280 --> 00:47.860]  that down coming up and we have freeway Ricky Ross not Rick Ross the fake
[00:47.860 --> 00:55.600]  rapper that resembles a black job of the hut but the real Rick Ross who was the
[00:55.600 --> 01:01.480]  biggest cocaine dealer ever known on the west coast 30 million dollars a day at
[01:01.480 --> 01:09.920]  some points for the Central Intelligence Agency as a distributor to fund the
[01:09.920 --> 01:14.080]  Iran contra operation that of course has now been declassified and confirmed
[01:14.080 --> 01:18.400]  validating Gary Webb that's why Gary Webb who'd won a whole bunch of awards
[01:18.400 --> 01:25.360]  had to have two bullets pumped into his brain back in 2004 now ten years
[01:25.360 --> 01:29.920]  later there's a big hit movie out that I've talked a lot about very powerful
[01:29.920 --> 01:33.200]  and that of course has killed the messenger based on a book that Webb
[01:33.200 --> 01:40.640]  wrote before he died we got Rick Ross joining us coming up at the bottom of
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.840]  the next hour of course there's a major character in the film who plays the part
[01:45.840 --> 01:53.480]  of Rick Ross will get his take on the film and more I knew Rick Ross back at
[01:53.480 --> 01:57.960]  the time and interviewed him and a new web and interviewed him as we can still
[01:57.960 --> 02:01.520]  talk to Rick Ross they haven't killed him yet knock on wood hope that doesn't
[02:01.520 --> 02:07.160]  hope that doesn't happen IMDB gives it a 7.3 it deserves more like a nine
[02:07.160 --> 02:12.880]  because if you knew Gary Webb and Rick Ross and the players and followed it you
[02:12.880 --> 02:18.760]  would know how accurate this film is almost like a documentary and it's not
[02:18.760 --> 02:21.920]  just about the CIA bringing drugs in everybody knows that pretty much
[02:21.920 --> 02:25.720]  everybody unless you're totally living under a rock and denial they've been
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.600]  caught so many times it's how they destroyed someone how they killed his
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.600]  name and then killed him but still like a phoenix he's risen again bigger than
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.360]  ever it's like Obi-Wan Kenobi strike me down I shall become more powerful than
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.600]  you can possibly imagine I think the film hit me so hard because to use a
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.200]  socialist term but I don't use it as the socialist meaning I am and have been
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.720]  and will be a fellow traveler with people like Gary Webb who are threatened
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.040]  and attacked and assassinated in the media they've told me they will
[03:00.040 --> 03:03.720]  assassinate me very serious people relayed that message in very serious
[03:03.720 --> 03:07.960]  ways and they told him a lot that before they killed him as well but that's all
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.200]  part of the great journey isn't it and all part of being a winner is not
[03:12.200 --> 03:15.960]  selling out to dehumanization and tyranny when everybody sells out out of
[03:15.960 --> 03:19.560]  fear evil wins and takes over and then you're ultimately destroyed you have
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.840]  hell on earth when good men and women take the field and stand up against all
[03:24.840 --> 03:29.000]  the different forms of tyranny and oppression you create renaissance systems
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.560]  that are a belt of honor and chivalry and that's the type of system I want to
[03:33.560 --> 03:39.440]  be in so Rick Ross will be joining us today was gonna be on the sky but is
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.440]  having some problems so probably be on for all hour in the next few weeks or
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.200]  hell he's off probation now they've been harassing him we need to fly him out
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.160]  here for an in-studio interview that's probably what we should do or for a film
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.560]  that's an idea we ought to talk to Rick about that today and then another
[03:55.560 --> 03:59.840]  filmmakers joining us there's no place like utopia Rick Ross the filmmaker to
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.320]  know Joel Gilbert to be with us in the third hour today to talk about the fake
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.600]  liberalism of collectivism and how it's really the ultimate form of
[04:09.600 --> 04:17.040]  domestication and disenfranchisement and tyranny so that is all coming up as we
[04:17.040 --> 04:22.400]  pull back the curtain and reveal the little man behind the curtain and all
[04:22.400 --> 04:28.440]  it takes everybody else Dorothy and the scarecrow and the cowardly lion they're
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.440]  all cowardly and fear but not little Toto little Toto all it takes is a child
[04:34.440 --> 04:38.840]  to call out to the emperor's butt naked all it takes is the little dog to pull
[04:38.840 --> 04:44.320]  back the curtain and show that the great and powerful Federal Reserve isn't even
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.320]  federal at all we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break I am

[09:15.120 --> 09:19.200]  is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city global governance at
[09:19.200 --> 09:23.960]  last is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living

[09:27.200 --> 09:47.080]  yes my friends and it is the 21st day already of October 2014 before you know
[09:47.080 --> 09:55.560]  it a twinkle of the eye it'll be 2015 and beyond we have freeway Ricky Ross the
[09:55.560 --> 10:01.360]  biggest known cocaine dealer in west coast history the work for the central
[10:01.360 --> 10:08.240]  intelligence agency he later learned in federal court and he's part of the

[10:15.200 --> 10:20.880]  accurate about the late great Gary Webb so that's coming up for 30 minutes at the
[10:20.880 --> 10:24.920]  bottom of the next hour then filmmaker Joel Gilbert there's no place like
[10:24.920 --> 10:29.680]  utopia will give us a take on his film now out on DVD and tie it into what's
[10:29.680 --> 10:32.760]  currently happening and what he thinks Obama who he's been tracking and
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.280]  researching very closely what he thinks Obama will do next as he becomes
[10:37.280 --> 10:43.600]  incredibly toxic if you go to drudge report calm that's the headline up
[10:43.600 --> 10:52.680]  there from patron saint to pariah how Obama became toxic for the Democrats and
[10:52.680 --> 10:58.760]  that's out of the London telegraph and Democrats running for the House and
[10:58.760 --> 11:03.000]  Senate are in trouble whether they're incumbents or running against a
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.120]  incumbent Republican they are in deep deep trouble some of the Republicans are
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.080]  good libertarian tea party types I'd say about half of them from the numbers
[11:13.080 --> 11:17.800]  I've seen that are running and winning right now and set to win in the polls in
[11:17.800 --> 11:26.880]  this midterm election that's just a few weeks away now but a lot of them are
[11:26.880 --> 11:31.240]  neocon rhino types unfortunately that are working with the Democrats and
[11:31.240 --> 11:37.560]  raising money from different establishment special interest groups to
[11:37.560 --> 11:45.240]  try to stop any attempt to write America's course onto a course that will
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.880]  give us some basic prosperity the political elite just have a will to
[11:49.880 --> 11:53.880]  power a will to crush this country a will to break the free market and
[11:53.880 --> 11:58.760]  submit their criminal takeover the difference is we're not going to sit
[11:58.760 --> 12:04.240]  here flat-footed and put a bunch of Republicans in and then watch them do
[12:04.240 --> 12:07.920]  the same old thing over and over again all the numbers all the polls show
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.120]  there is a major political awakening a major political realignment that hasn't
[12:13.120 --> 12:17.000]  happened in over a hundred plus years in this country and it's happening all
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.760]  over the world as well and with the singularity approaching off in the
[12:20.760 --> 12:26.400]  distance and many many singularities on the path to that everything is
[12:26.400 --> 12:31.920]  compacted everything is accelerated right now and the political elite better
[12:31.920 --> 12:37.440]  know thousands of armored vehicles billions of rounds of ammo militarized
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.680]  police are not going to protect you if you shut down the economy and steal
[12:41.680 --> 12:47.520]  everything a free market and prosperity is what protects elites and nouveau
[12:47.520 --> 12:53.800]  reach and prosperity but time and time again in history elites get greedy
[12:53.800 --> 13:01.920]  everybody knows the story of the golden goose he stops fables where this goose
[13:01.920 --> 13:07.360]  starts laying golden eggs and the farmer becomes incredibly rich and then he
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.840]  gets greedy and goes with the goose and says I want two eggs every day and the
[13:11.840 --> 13:18.000]  goose says all I can lay is one golden egg a day and then the goose does as
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.080]  hard as it can lays two golden eggs and the farmer comes back and says I want
[13:22.080 --> 13:26.040]  three or I'm gonna kill you and cut those eggs out finally the goose couldn't lay
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.320]  any more eggs and the farmer came with a hatchet and split its guts open and
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.600]  there was no eggs inside ladies and gentlemen and this is what political
[13:35.600 --> 13:42.800]  greedy systems do over and over again for short-term gain they slaughter the
[13:42.800 --> 13:48.640]  entire herd as they see us and then there's no cows the next year and I put
[13:48.640 --> 13:52.000]  that out from an elitist perspective that we're all a bunch of human resources
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.640]  animals that are dumbered in the box of rocks and they're all up there just to
[13:55.640 --> 13:59.680]  pray on us and lie to us why would any of you elitist want to create a world
[13:59.680 --> 14:06.200]  where your kids have to be raised around a bunch of brain-damaged people now I'm
[14:06.200 --> 14:09.680]  gonna get into Ebola I'm gonna get into a bunch of science news there is a lot of
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.920]  really powerful news today IBM is plunging in stocks
[14:13.920 --> 14:22.960]  McDonald's is plunging as well ISIS is making big gains and big moves in Iraq
[14:22.960 --> 14:31.160]  huge Ebola news the Ebola czar I told you work for Al Gore and eugenics he's
[14:31.160 --> 14:35.240]  now come out we have the video and said population reduction is needed and the
[14:35.240 --> 14:42.560]  biggest problem is the population in Africa and he said this a year ago he
[14:42.560 --> 14:46.720]  says the number one problem is overpopulation this is a big carbon
[14:46.720 --> 14:51.000]  tax or globalist that wants to tax the West but put double taxes on the third
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.160]  world stop their development which would actually lower their population
[14:55.160 --> 14:58.280]  because there are some areas that are overpopulated there's no doubting that
[14:58.280 --> 15:01.440]  but the globalists have the schizophrenic move of wanting a dumb down
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.880]  population and not letting them industrialize so then they have five six
[15:04.880 --> 15:10.320]  seven eight kids whether it's poor people in eastern Europe Asia or Africa then
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.320]  their answer is come in and hit them with vaccines with sterilants on top of
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.000]  it but the Africans aren't stupid like Americans they run from the UN
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.120]  vehicles they have to have the police you can look this up in these countries
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.360]  arrest people and take them in for four shots because the Africans notice they
[15:29.360 --> 15:33.080]  have miscarriages they can't have kids anymore they die when they're given the
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.720]  tetanus shots and other vaccines they're not stupid they're not naive like we
[15:38.720 --> 15:43.680]  are I'm just telling you they're not there they're silly and ignorant a lot
[15:43.680 --> 15:47.120]  of ways in Africa I've studied the different regions and different subgroups
[15:47.120 --> 15:50.120]  and what's going on there but they understand that they're being attacked
[15:50.120 --> 15:53.920]  and their scientists do and they have major medical facilities there and
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.160]  people trained in the West and it's been identified in South Africa
[15:58.160 --> 16:04.040]  declassified in 1993 project coast and a bunch of other programs injecting black
[16:04.040 --> 16:09.960]  people with sterilants weaponized Ebola systems that make women have an auto
[16:09.960 --> 16:19.240]  immune response to sperm so that's all coming out before I go any further I was
[16:19.240 --> 16:23.960]  talking to a famous person yesterday I'll just leave it at that because it's
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.680]  interesting the reason I plot to their famous it's just that that's where this
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.720]  type of talk goes on and this person listens to the show and has seen my
[16:32.720 --> 16:44.120]  films and he was talking to another very famous athlete and the famous athlete
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.920]  was basically saying hey eugenics isn't bad and Ebola isn't bad we need to
[16:51.920 --> 16:58.440]  reduce population and when you let diseases kill people then the stronger
[16:58.440 --> 17:04.280]  survive well at one level that's true but are you ready to die you're ready to
[17:04.280 --> 17:07.560]  have your kids died to prove that
[17:10.640 --> 17:18.360]  I mean think about this so I was having this debate and I said listen surface
[17:18.360 --> 17:23.400]  eugenics is make the elite morally and healthier and better looking but get rid
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.400]  of the dumb people real eugenics is make the general public dumb target the most
[17:28.400 --> 17:32.080]  intelligent and try to dumb them down and then they make it through all those
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.600]  hurdles with test scores then hire them to work for the system just like a
[17:36.600 --> 17:43.520]  grizzly bear will go out and smell the the the newborn cub or what do you call
[17:43.520 --> 17:52.240]  a baby bear cub yeah and we'll eat it lions and tigers males will go out and
[17:52.240 --> 17:56.200]  find baby males and eat them because they don't want the competition and
[17:56.200 --> 18:02.680]  that's the true eugenics okay it's bad enough to say we're gonna sterilize
[18:02.680 --> 18:08.240]  mentally retarded people and all of this and and sterilize people that have
[18:08.240 --> 18:14.040]  genetic disorders so they can't have kids or whatever even though I've seen
[18:14.040 --> 18:17.120]  major studies showing that a lot of people that have genetic disorders will
[18:17.120 --> 18:21.840]  also then have some super quirk idiot savant level intelligence or their kid
[18:21.840 --> 18:29.760]  will these mutations happen for a reason but I could sit back and see the
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.560]  eugenics view and say should we have people with Down syndrome you know
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.120]  getting together having kids well no that's a bad decision but do you want
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.400]  to let to use the ring of Mordor to start sterilizing those poor folks
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.320]  because then you're next that's how this works ladies and gentlemen what Christ
[18:45.320 --> 18:49.880]  said is what I live by what you do to the least of these you've done to me how
[18:49.880 --> 18:54.980]  we treat old people and mentally retarded children and combat injured
[18:54.980 --> 18:59.960]  veterans is the measure of how we're gonna be treated in our lives on this
[18:59.960 --> 19:06.320]  planet and then when we're judged by God it'd be better to tie a giant five
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.160]  thousand pound rock around your neck and throw it in the ocean a millstone then
[19:11.160 --> 19:15.440]  to hurt innocent people and it's childlike minds the globalist want us to
[19:15.440 --> 19:20.240]  be arrested development children for life simple minded so they can pray on
[19:20.240 --> 19:26.400]  us it's like a giant van playing ice cream truck music with kids trying to
[19:26.400 --> 19:30.160]  lure little kids in with candy that's the new world order with Obamacare and
[19:30.160 --> 19:35.980]  all the free goodies and I was sent by a friend photos not confirmed it's going

[24:33.880 --> 24:38.680]  and surveil everything we do in our cars time magazine let's fix it let's end
[24:38.680 --> 24:44.200]  human driving which means end human travel and the police already believe
[24:44.200 --> 24:47.760]  it's a privilege even though it's not they're also teaching them owning a gun
[24:47.760 --> 24:55.440]  as a privilege it is not commerce on publicly paid for roads is a privilege
[24:55.440 --> 25:00.600]  not travel I'm not gonna quote the Supreme Court rulings if the police
[25:00.600 --> 25:05.000]  want to look up the facts they will most of them already know so there you go

[25:22.080 --> 25:27.840]  building with 200 square foot coffin apartments and that's just the start no
[25:27.840 --> 25:32.040]  one should want them to model the future these transhumanist eugenicist
[25:32.040 --> 25:37.240]  globalist but they come to the top athletes and the top scientists in the
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.640]  top of every field ago you're an elitist you should be part of the eugenicist

[26:16.760 --> 26:20.960]  be established to carry out mass culling because that's all they talk
[26:20.960 --> 26:29.240]  about eco science did the current czar obama's obola czar thinks there's too
[26:29.240 --> 26:34.040]  many people info wars.com administration hires another over population
[26:34.040 --> 26:37.720]  fanatic that's what I said days ago that's the office he was over between

[27:26.360 --> 27:31.760]  with a trousers pocket full of goodies in sealed vials that he claimed were new
[27:31.760 --> 27:37.520]  and wonderful organisms and could do the most wonderful things on earth
[27:38.120 --> 27:44.760]  Larry Ford had mutated cholera typhoid anthrax botulism bubonic plague and it

[27:49.680 --> 27:54.560]  know in effort cons is the equivalent of the n-word now now this clip was coming
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.280]  up next this is the clip that was aired on BBC back in the 90s about the
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.200]  different scientists with the U.S. and in South Africa creating sterilants and
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.440]  when weaponized airborne Ebola we're gonna come back in the next segment with
[28:08.440 --> 28:13.920]  that here is the particular clip Obama's Ebola czar thinks there's too many
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.800]  people in Africa administration hires another overpopulation fanatic Ron
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.600]  Klein who doesn't need any medical background or Ebola background no he
[28:24.600 --> 28:28.680]  just needs to know there are too many people which the African scientists are
[28:28.680 --> 28:32.720]  saying it's been weaponized and the man that wrote the U.S. chemical biological
[28:32.720 --> 28:39.360]  weapons tree that the UN adopted Francis Boyle Dr. Francis Boyle who went
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.440]  through Kissinger's secret PhD program and was vetted to be the next Kissinger

[28:58.640 --> 29:05.560]  ignore the experts let's actually go to the Obama czar I think the top
[29:05.560 --> 29:09.040]  leadership is you're telling your world today is how to deal with the
[29:09.040 --> 29:15.320]  continuing growing population world and all the resource demands places on the
[29:15.320 --> 29:22.400]  world and burgeoning populations in Africa and Asia that lack the resources
[29:22.400 --> 29:28.600]  to have a healthy happy life and I think we've got to find a way to make the
[29:28.600 --> 29:32.600]  world work for everyone and this woman sits here nodding at him like he's God
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.920]  they all talk of these fake official do fake deliberative voices as they spout

[34:38.840 --> 34:43.960]  publications have said that's the plan now separately thousands of times
[34:43.960 --> 34:48.880]  hundreds of times just the last few months I have been attacked for trying
[34:48.880 --> 34:53.800]  to rally humanity in the face of the clear and present stated enemy agenda
[34:53.800 --> 35:04.360]  and yeah it's fantastical it's freaky it's crazy but it's happening just like
[35:04.360 --> 35:07.440]  all over the world our government injected poor people with cephalus it
[35:07.440 --> 35:13.400]  wasn't just blacks in Tuskegee it was Guatemalans it was people injected with
[35:13.400 --> 35:19.120]  it in Pakistan injected with polio injected with sterilants injected with
[35:19.120 --> 35:24.600]  you name it they've got history channel shows that I saw 20 something years ago
[35:24.600 --> 35:30.080]  and I went and looked it up it was declassified that they radiated 4,000
[35:30.080 --> 35:35.760]  plus foster kids who were even healthy in some cases they gave them low dosages
[35:35.760 --> 35:42.240]  other cases they put them in there and would fry them on the spot and in the
[35:42.240 --> 35:47.400]  reports the army and other scientists say well as I heard the four-year-old cry
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.760]  and beg their body literally burned and it took several hours for them to die as
[35:51.760 --> 35:54.560]  we monitored I felt very sad that they had to do this but it was for the greater
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.680]  good see it was about finding cadres of people that would take a three-year-old
[35:59.680 --> 36:05.080]  and stick them in a radiation chamber and then hit them so hard that their feet
[36:05.080 --> 36:11.680]  would burn to the ground like frying eggs oh the government does it bring
[36:11.680 --> 36:18.720]  drugs in no the government does it launder money no it's nice it wants to
[36:18.720 --> 36:23.840]  give me college scholarships it wants me to watch football games it wants me to
[36:23.840 --> 36:33.360]  turn my guns in so we can all be peaceful oh it's not behind the Ebola the
[36:33.360 --> 36:38.200]  government isn't a government it is eugenicist social engineers who have
[36:38.200 --> 36:46.120]  disdain and hatred for humanity they make Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer look
[36:46.120 --> 36:53.440]  like angels compared to them they have disdain and a love of death and if you
[36:53.440 --> 37:00.000]  won't get it if you won't get that understanding we're gonna lose I know
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.680]  you're not like that so it's so alien you don't understand it some of the new
[37:03.680 --> 37:10.080]  lessons out there I will assure you this is what we face it is the opposite of
[37:10.080 --> 37:17.120]  being Christ like but they sell to those of us that are Christ like in that our
[37:17.120 --> 37:20.480]  hearts are inclined towards helping the innocent helping the weak building
[37:20.480 --> 37:26.240]  people up letting people know the rabbit trick enjoy seeing young people learn
[37:26.240 --> 37:31.160]  and be empowered enjoy seeing other people that are successful enjoy and
[37:31.160 --> 37:35.360]  admire musicians that can play beautiful music admire men and women that are
[37:35.360 --> 37:41.280]  beautiful or handsome we're blind spiritually to the evil ones that hate
[37:41.280 --> 37:45.920]  beauty and hate strength and hate honor but they sell us on a fake
[37:45.920 --> 37:51.000]  Christianoid liberalism of give your money for the poor people aren't you
[37:51.000 --> 37:59.600]  like Jesus liberation theology but you notice the money they give is not to
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.920]  empower someone to know how to fish it is simply to get people to become
[38:04.920 --> 38:09.360]  domesticated and to live off the government dole that the Roman system
[38:09.360 --> 38:21.560]  had 2000 plus years ago to control the voting Romans to control the Senate we're
[38:21.560 --> 38:25.800]  going down a crony system instead of an open system and then there's always
[38:25.800 --> 38:30.040]  aspects of both in any system there's no such thing as utopia under the
[38:30.040 --> 38:36.200]  dominion of man and the god of this world who's not the good guy but you're
[38:36.200 --> 38:41.360]  going to see the total incremental rollout you think they're going to stop
[38:41.360 --> 38:49.040]  with front line parking spaces or people that have electric cars and then
[38:49.040 --> 38:55.600]  people that that carpool no they're going to make whole cities driverless
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.320]  cars in the next few years it's now moving to that and all the PR and all
[39:01.320 --> 39:05.680]  the statistics you'll pay five times more on insurance if you try to drive
[39:05.680 --> 39:09.880]  yourself because they don't want you doing what you want they want everything
[39:09.880 --> 39:16.000]  you do tracked and traced and controlled beyond the NSA so they can rig the whole
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.760]  system and actuary the entire economy to make sure there's no underground economy
[39:21.760 --> 39:26.360]  when they shut the economy off and that's in the news again today that the
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.680]  NSA isn't really about spying on people so much politically though that's part
[39:30.680 --> 39:37.320]  of it it's almost entirely about rigging markets and stealing ideas and making
[39:37.320 --> 39:44.640]  sure the insiders can take over just like when you post you're going on
[39:44.640 --> 39:48.120]  vacation and what you got for Christmas and where you live and thieves come and
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.520]  rob your house when you're gone because you were dumb enough to put it on
[39:50.520 --> 39:54.840]  Facebook because you're a good person you didn't do anything wrong so what's the
[39:54.840 --> 39:58.440]  big deal let your cell phone track you let people know where you live don't
[39:58.440 --> 40:02.040]  leave your house locked or or let folks know what you got for Christmas and
[40:02.040 --> 40:06.920]  then see someone comes and robs you and you're like why I'm a nice person they
[40:06.920 --> 40:13.040]  came and robbed you because you are a nice person you're a schmuck
[40:15.040 --> 40:22.800]  good people have to stop acting like jellyfish sheep idiots or you will be
[40:22.800 --> 40:30.840]  overrun and worse under all the fake Christ like counterfeit Christ garbage
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.120]  you will say I've got to let the state run my kids in my life and my house and
[40:35.120 --> 40:41.520]  tax me more because I'm stingy because I'm only paying 70% one tax or another
[40:41.520 --> 40:46.440]  70% is what the average upper middle class person pays in this country the
[40:46.440 --> 40:51.400]  ultra rich pay almost nothing on record because they wrote the loss you like
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.240]  good do you have any idea back when Kennedy cut taxes by half what happened
[40:55.240 --> 41:01.240]  tax receipts doubled the middle class exploded the biggest rate ever because
[41:01.240 --> 41:04.040]  it was more money for you to decide were to spend it they don't want you to have
[41:04.040 --> 41:09.000]  money to vote in the free market because that'll build a beautiful world of big
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.760]  nice luxury facilities and nice houses and nice cars and and vacations and
[41:13.760 --> 41:17.480]  going where you want and traveling where you want the globalists don't want a
[41:17.480 --> 41:23.400]  world like that their excuses it hurts the earth headline why a depression would
[41:23.400 --> 41:27.200]  be good for the carbon footprint and good for the earth that article was in
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.280]  thousands of publications but they're not even trying to turn off the the
[41:31.280 --> 41:35.240]  economy to really help the earth they're busy destroying it with GMO and
[41:35.240 --> 41:40.520]  cross species garbage and you name it as fast as they can they're doing it
[41:40.520 --> 41:45.240]  because they want you destitute so they have the money and the power and you
[41:45.240 --> 41:51.200]  have nothing where there is freedom they don't control where there is wealth
[41:51.200 --> 41:55.040]  they don't control got it it's fundamental they don't it's not that
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.560]  they don't care about you they hate you they do care about you they care
[41:59.560 --> 42:03.400]  desperately about destroying you and your family and dumbing you down and
[42:03.400 --> 42:09.000]  putting deadly vaccines in you and deadly fluoride in you and everyone
[42:09.000 --> 42:13.360]  inherently knows this deep down but you can intellectually go check everything
[42:13.360 --> 42:19.720]  I've said it's true and replicate in spades I will never sign on to
[42:19.720 --> 42:24.720]  sterilizing people in Africa I will never sign on to injecting appellation
[42:24.720 --> 42:30.600]  people with syphilis I will never sign on to 54 million abortions I will never
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.280]  sign on to any of this because the minute you sign on to that ladies and
[42:34.280 --> 42:37.960]  gentlemen you step over to the other side and let me tell you now you are
[42:37.960 --> 42:43.680]  openly working under the God of this world who wants to destroy your soul and
[42:43.680 --> 42:48.200]  you fools out there that don't know it's about that are idiots this is 100%
[42:48.200 --> 42:53.960]  spiritual demonic warfare going on manifesting itself on a planetary scale
[42:53.960 --> 42:58.920]  with robots and electric systems controlled by the beast that will
[42:58.920 --> 43:03.600]  micromanage everything we do and I got news for you you're not gonna be
[43:03.600 --> 43:08.160]  raptured out of it German Christians thought they were gonna be raptured
[43:08.160 --> 43:12.840]  in World War two Christians in Russia Christians in China that doctrines
[43:12.840 --> 43:16.960]  only 200 years old folks it doesn't happen
[43:18.960 --> 43:24.360]  and even if you don't believe in God you better know this system is evil they
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.240]  teach psychologists and psychology and psychiatrists that there's no good and
[43:28.240 --> 43:33.200]  evil that you're beyond good and evil what baloney that's saying you can't
[43:33.200 --> 43:38.080]  have a choice of what you discriminate against that you believe robbing an old
[43:38.080 --> 43:41.360]  lady and knocking her over the head is evil and you believe helping an old
[43:41.360 --> 43:45.160]  lady is good yes there is good and evil there is right and wrong that's why
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.760]  they've come out and said why the grocery store we can't have gingerbread men or
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.240]  gingerbread women because that gives people a choice it notes a difference
[43:54.240 --> 44:00.120]  and any difference is evil so that's the opposite of diversity breaking through
[44:00.120 --> 44:06.160]  the binary gender explained using continuance guys actually have the photo
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.280]  on my phone and I want to give it to the guys this is being sold in Austin as
[44:11.280 --> 44:18.240]  well where it says gender neutral gingerbread person and it's about
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.840]  throwing at your head foreign banks have robbed over a thousand trillion
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.240]  dollars from the worldwide community by design world government's being formed
[44:26.240 --> 44:29.280]  our government's funding al-qaeda to chop everybody's heads off that isn't a
[44:29.280 --> 44:35.320]  radical Islamist our test scores are plummeting cancer is exploding the
[44:35.320 --> 44:45.120]  borders wide open they're letting Ebola come into the country and the mayor of
[44:45.120 --> 44:49.440]  Houston wants to arrest preachers and is subpoenaing them because they've
[44:49.440 --> 44:55.080]  criticized homosexuality what a terrorist over the first amendment
[44:55.080 --> 45:01.640]  gender inclusive school district says drop boys and girls call kids purple
[45:01.640 --> 45:06.640]  penguins just screwing these kids up big time that there's something wrong with
[45:06.640 --> 45:10.480]  being a girl something wrong with being a boy something wrong with girls
[45:10.480 --> 45:13.880]  wanting to be pretty and have fun and something wrong with boys wanting to be
[45:13.880 --> 45:19.200]  tough and build things this is a bunch of social engineers literally ruling you
[45:19.200 --> 45:24.720]  Austin City Council approves gender neutral bathrooms gonna make you go in
[45:24.720 --> 45:30.160]  the bathroom I've actually been in restaurants and hotels where it says
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.520]  man and woman you gotta go the bathroom you walk in and there's a woman coming
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.080]  out of the stall and I just I just leave I just I mean I'm not gonna go sit on
[45:40.080 --> 45:45.320]  the toilet next to a woman so you control freaks can have your way man what
[45:45.320 --> 45:51.200]  is your problem fruits and they're not fruits it's social engineering overturn
[45:51.200 --> 45:55.760]  existing orders make us do whatever they want screw with everybody continually
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.200]  if you want to go get a sex change or you like to wear dresses or you what I
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.520]  meant I'm not in your business I'm a libertarian but you're not really
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.120]  liberals at the top you're a bunch of sick control freaks that want to go in
[46:10.120 --> 46:13.840]  and sexualize five-year-old children they have a name for that it's called
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.680]  Nambla and by the way the UN accepts Nambla and they've had top UN members
[46:18.680 --> 46:24.400]  top Australian judges top British judges come out and say well people should be
[46:24.400 --> 46:27.960]  able to date your five-year-old if your neighbor wants to date your five-year-old
[46:27.960 --> 46:34.240]  they should be able to literally look it up
[46:34.240 --> 46:37.800]  see they're not saying kids can give consent to have vaccines to be paid by
[46:37.800 --> 46:41.400]  the school to get them well why can't kids then drink liquor if you're an
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.000]  adult and give liquor to your neighbor's kid you go to jail and you should if
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.480]  you're pushing a bunch of liquor on them because you're contributing to the
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.760]  frequency of minors you have violated the age of consent just like if you're
[46:51.760 --> 46:55.320]  you know 18 your date the 16-year-old I don't think that's statutory rape but
[46:55.320 --> 47:00.120]  they'll throw the book at you for that but schools can then go in and mess with
[47:00.120 --> 47:04.400]  a seven-year-old and sexualize them and that's okay because it's politically
[47:04.400 --> 47:11.160]  correct see how screwed up this is meanwhile it was declassified in 1993
[47:11.160 --> 47:16.880]  in Australia Israel's Knesset released some of it in 2000 the British released
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.040]  some of it in 2000 the US admitted some of it in 2000 as well it was in the
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.320]  Austin American statesman and the response of PNAC project for the
[47:26.320 --> 47:29.560]  American Century headed up by Dick Cheney was to publish in newspapers all
[47:29.560 --> 47:34.080]  over the country an article calling for the legitimate use of race specific
[47:34.080 --> 47:37.800]  bio weapons the statesman do its credit as I mentioned yesterday
[47:37.800 --> 47:44.360]  type in race specific bio weapons PNAC and then click Google reply pull up the
[47:44.360 --> 47:49.640]  statesman the statesman came out and decried it kind of a real liberal thing
[47:49.640 --> 47:53.680]  to do not a fake liberal thing to do this is the insanity show we've got
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.680]  governments with bio weapon labs all over the world creating airborne Ebola I
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.400]  played the Nova special for you all this they're creating stuff to quote kill
[48:03.400 --> 48:09.040]  the kafers that's the n-word in in South African Israel wanted it for the
[48:09.040 --> 48:15.840]  Arabs that's been declassified that was in Jane's weapons quarterly in 2000 and
[48:15.840 --> 48:21.160]  what is the response of publications every day Alex Jones is insane there is
[48:21.160 --> 48:27.480]  no plan to kill Africans bull bull bull and those reporters all know it's been
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.640]  in newspapers hundreds of times and has admitted this is going on so the minute
[48:31.640 --> 48:36.040]  you come out and say I'm a liar when I'm trying to stop this means you're
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.400]  aiding and abetting it and you've now signed on to it so you think about why
[48:39.400 --> 48:43.240]  you've got such bad luck why you're so unhappy why bad things happen to your
[48:43.240 --> 48:48.560]  kids it's because you are serving evil let me give evil people a newsflash you
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.200]  will pay for evil when you're alive you will not escape judgment I got news for
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.200]  you I know all these evil people have hellish lives the worst luck you've
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.760]  ever seen let me tell you I'm God-fearing I don't believe I get my good luck
[49:01.760 --> 49:08.120]  because you know I'm trying to be good I do it out of a fear of God and wanting
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.040]  to help people and a drive to defend the innocent not because I'm a hero but
[49:13.040 --> 49:16.280]  because that's a default position let's go to this clip and then we'll go to
[49:16.280 --> 49:20.200]  break but here here is the documentary admitting with the doctor himself the
[49:20.200 --> 49:25.560]  bio-weapon program it was a wonderful father matters that he used to rock up
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.560]  in South Africa having flown in intercontinental flights with a
[49:28.560 --> 49:33.680]  trousers pocket full of goodies in sealed vials that he claimed with new
[49:33.680 --> 49:39.400]  and wonderful organisms and could do the most wonderful things on earth
[49:39.960 --> 49:46.680]  Larry Ford had mutated cholera typhoid anthrax botulism bubonic plague and it
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.600]  also come up with germs that he called kaffa killing germs kaffa as you may
[49:51.600 --> 49:57.240]  know in effort cons is the equivalent of the n-word so these are germs that was
[49:57.240 --> 50:03.440]  specifically engineered to kill only black people in other words an ethnic
[50:03.440 --> 50:11.520]  biological weapon had project coast really gone this far from the beginning
[50:11.520 --> 50:16.960]  this idea of can we find a way to control the size of the black population
[50:16.960 --> 50:21.520]  was considered one of the most important areas of research it got even more
[50:21.520 --> 50:27.440]  important over time as the size of the black population and seriousness of the
[50:27.440 --> 50:34.560]  uprising is increased so there that's one reason why they got into genetic
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.080]  modification we're gonna come back you know I want to play this whole eight
[50:38.080 --> 50:45.280]  minute clip and then the average liberals say well there are too many black
[50:45.280 --> 50:49.480]  people on go oh you're liberal and it's only a cover folks with most of these
[50:49.480 --> 50:53.320]  so-called liberals you get behind closed doors they're flaming racist including
[50:53.320 --> 50:58.640]  black ones against other blacks these people are sick

[54:51.440 --> 54:58.520]  here on the radio dealing with Ebola not just living 21 days in the body but
[54:58.520 --> 55:03.920]  41 in a certain percentage and 70 days in sperm so why are they letting people
[55:03.920 --> 55:08.720]  out yesterday 40 plus people that were quarantined only 21 days after they
[55:08.720 --> 55:14.240]  didn't show signs this is of great concern the fiance of Ebola victim Thomas
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.920]  Eric Duncan will be released from quarantine today however the CDC
[55:18.920 --> 55:23.440]  mandated 21 day quarantine period Louise Trow along with her son and two
[55:23.440 --> 55:27.480]  nephews and dirt is only half of the recommended period World Health
[55:27.480 --> 55:31.760]  Organization states recent studies conducted in West Africa have
[55:31.760 --> 55:36.520]  demonstrated that 95% of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the
[55:36.520 --> 55:41.840]  range of one to 21 days 98% have an incubation period that falls within the
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.720]  one to 42 day interval the World Health Organization is therefore confident that
[55:46.720 --> 55:52.040]  detection of no new cases with active surveillance in place throughout this
[55:52.040 --> 55:57.760]  42 day period means that an Ebola outbreak is indeed over Drexel University
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.080]  professor Charles Haas released a study of the literature behind the Ebola
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.880]  incubation period the 21 day incubation period is based on the general rule
[56:06.880 --> 56:10.800]  held for all infectious diseases the lower the initial dose of the
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.040]  microorganisms you have the longer it will take for them to accumulate to a
[56:15.040 --> 56:19.200]  critical level Haas discovered that according to the statistics generated
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.040]  from the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone Liberia and Guinea and the earlier
[56:24.040 --> 56:29.720]  outbreak in Congo in 1995 there is up to a 12% chance that someone infected with
[56:29.720 --> 56:35.040]  Ebola may take longer than 21 days to show symptoms of the disease the World
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.080]  Health Organization does not declare an Ebola outbreak contained per country
[56:39.080 --> 56:44.960]  until that country has passed the 42 day incubation period Nigeria reached the
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.840]  42 day milestone after an outbreak of 19 cases began on July 23rd the clean
[56:50.840 --> 56:54.920]  bill of health for Nigeria can also be attributed to the rapid shutdown of its
[56:54.920 --> 57:00.440]  borders with Cameroon Chad and Benin the death toll in West Africa has now
[57:00.440 --> 57:07.200]  reached 4,500 people John bound for info wars dot com that's right a bunch of

[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.760]  reports this week dealing with Ebola one of them is titled the suits of the
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.880]  super wealthy elites agenda for depopulation so I thought we'd play
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.320]  that special report from the nightly news on Monday here on the Tuesday edition
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.520]  just to illustrate and document the type of people were dealing with we were
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.080]  actually managing much of the Ebola response now that we have the new
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.160]  Ebola czar coming out saying the main problem is overpopulation in Africa
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.640]  that's Ron Klain's statement let's go ahead and dovetail that with this
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:03.480]  special report then we'll take your phone calls in the next segment
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.440]  Royal Highness Prince Charles who can trace his ancestry back to Romania's
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:16.280]  dark and distant past the genealogy shows I'm to send you from Vlad the impenetrable side
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.520]  you have a bit of a stake in the country that's it work
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.440]  forcing mothers to devour their own children according to your own census
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.560]  you killed over a hundred thousand people forgeries and lies do you deny
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:35.480]  that you murdered your own people those who broke the law were punished what do
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.640]  you see is the biggest challenges in in conservation the growing human
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:46.040]  population if where we are there's nothing else and you have views about
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.640]  what should be done about that don't you guess we've got to stabilize the
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.120]  population when I was born so what's wrong with the population I mean with too
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:59.320]  many people that's what that's why we have global warming we have global
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.360]  warming because too many people are using too much stuff back in 1997 when
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.400]  Ted Turner announced his historic support for the United Nations no one
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.840]  could have known how the foundation would evolve and what his role would be
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:21.520]  today we know that Ted Turner has delivered beyond anyone's best hopes the
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:26.880]  UN Foundation has become the United Nations best friend the negative impact
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:34.640]  of population growth on all of our planetary ecosystems is becoming appalling
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:39.320]  the evidence new world order mr. Rothschild well new world order the
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:46.280]  population of this genocide this equation has four factors a little bit of
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.160]  multiplication so you've got a thing on the left co2 that you want to get to
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.960]  zero and that's going to be based on the number of people the services each
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.720]  person choosing on average the energy on average for each service and the co2
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:07.720]  being put out a per unit of energy so let's look at each one of these and see
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.280]  how we can get this down to zero probably one of these numbers is going to
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:21.760]  have to get pretty near to zero that's the myth of overpopulation originated
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.960]  in England in 1798 when a vicar named Thomas Malthus who fancied himself
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.680]  something of a mathematician saw that food production increased incrementally
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.680]  but people reproduced exponentially he sat down and did some simple math and
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.160]  summarily decided that the world would be out of food by 1890 he blamed reduced
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.480]  mortality rates and recommended killing off the have-nots of society lest the
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:48.000]  haves starve to death this cry was taken up by Paul Ehrlich of Stanford
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.440]  University in 1968 who claimed that reckless human reproduction had
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.880]  overwhelmed the earth massive famines would result which would destroy best
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.120]  case scenario one-fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s and the planet would
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.200]  follow this fear produced large donations for the newly created UNFPA which
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.080]  thrives on an imagined crisis that has been both imminent and rescheduled again
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.280]  again over the past two centuries the truth of the matter is that every family
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.440]  on this planet could have a house with a yard and all live together on a landmass
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.680]  the size of Texas which is really just a small corner of the planet the
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.640]  population of earth will peak in 30 years and then start to go back down
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.040]  we're not overpopulated do the math
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:44.440]  thank you George Carlin thank you John bound putting that report together but
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.680]  remember they're doing everything they can to block new technologies to empower

[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.240]  some of the incredibly important headlines at prisonplanet.com and info
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:24.840]  wars dot com British spy chief calls for crackdown on internet freedom Wayne
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:29.920]  Madsen of the formerly the NSA says Ebola epidemic linked to CIA and special
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:36.640]  report Obama's Ebola czar thinks there are too many people in Africa scientists
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.480]  have come out and said Ebola can spread by air in cold weather because the
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:47.680]  sunlight can't kill it so we have army reports and others in this
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.000]  Kent Daniels article saying that they believe it could go airborne in the
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.800]  winter and that it is indeed airborne in below about 45 degrees go read the CDC
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.680]  the UN and the army reports it's red linked on info wars dot com by kit
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.920]  Daniels he spent four days writing the article it's very well documented has

[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:22.840]  international business times and Mother Jones and everyone else can say that
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.720]  we're insane and none of this is happening just like we said bringing in
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.840]  people that had Ebola to Europe in the US would probably spread it and it has so
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.760]  that's the news we've got up there I mean while British spy chief calls for
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.280]  crackdown on internet freedom why do you think all of the libertarian or pro
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:45.640]  America pro free market websites from drugs report dot com the world that
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:52.320]  daily dot com to info wars dot com the top 10 sites basically drudge on down
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:58.880]  all had their Alexa traffic the big amazon dot com traffic service that I've
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.000]  been watching for 16 years at least why do you think they suddenly just said we
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.440]  have no visitors but if you have a subscription you can see that our
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.960]  listeners and our viewers are exploding people visiting the sites and every
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.720]  socialist anti-american side from CNN MSNBC to media matters exploded because
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:22.280]  on the back end that they're imploding and so it embarrasses them that info
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.640]  wars dot com is literally I was looking at a few months ago it's like 14,000
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.040]  times more visitors or something than media matters 2,000 times plus more than
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.440]  MSNBC I mean it's not just that we dominate them they're a joke and so they
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:43.320]  can't let people know that and then drudge tens of thousands of times more
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.480]  visitors literally go to the math he got billion visitors a month at MSNBC
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.840]  gets a few million I mean they're a joke they're a joke listen it doesn't matter
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.400]  if you rig everything everyone knows where the audience is so now they just
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:02.120]  want to censor the web to begin with so don't take info wars dot com and
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.120]  prison planet dot com for granted or any other site and don't take amnfm for
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.640]  granted they're trying to bring in fairness doctrine and restrict free
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.840]  speech there the FCC announced two weeks ago they want to regulate the internet
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.560]  they got internet kill switches in they got Obama messages over the smart
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.480]  phones they will cheat folks because we are literally cleaning their clocks up
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.880]  one side and down the other because we're the patriots we're the real
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:34.080]  liberals like your house is yours your money is yours your guns are yours your
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:41.400]  family belongs to you and them not the state this is cult level totalitarianism
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:47.320]  dressed up saying it's liberal with a sycophantic NPR voice financed by David
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:54.120]  Rockefeller on record now here's the toll-free number to join us I'm gonna
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.160]  take some calls ahead of free Ricky Ross joining us at the bottom of the hour
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.840]  big whistleblower on CIA drug dealing big part of the new film it's really a
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.720]  documentary in my view big hit film kill the messenger guys we give me the
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.200]  Wikipedia or IMDB print on all that so I have it all accurate when it comes up
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:16.080]  thank you I knew Ricky Ross I talked a lot about it last week when I saw the
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.040]  film it just dumbfounded me how accurate it was and I'm really surprised by
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.760]  Hollywood putting something that's truthful out good job but see if you
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.720]  didn't know Gary Webb and hadn't been interviewing Ricky Ross for ten years
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.320]  interviewed Ricky Ross in prison you just don't know how accurate it is and
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:40.080]  how the actor Renner looks just like a younger Gary Webb by the time he got his
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.800]  head blown off in 2004 he looked like he does at the end of the movie but it just
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:51.240]  makes my head spin that's coming up 800 2599231 and guys my phone system needs
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.880]  to be rebooted just a little tip if you see it just saying it's turned off and
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.720]  we can reboot it thank you so much so we're gonna take your phone calls 800
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:12.040]  2599231 now all of that said let me hit some more of these headlines US
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:17.680]  cautiously optimistic after no new Ebola cases in five days I think there's
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.920]  evidence of them covering up the real number of cases do you really believe
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.880]  they gave them the two nurses that knew what they were doing and then nobody
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.120]  else on the on airplanes or anything's gotten it and they're releasing people
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.560]  after 21 days when they now go oh it's actually 40 41 and they're letting more
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.840]  West African flights come in with all this projectile vomit and people dying
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.880]  vomiting but they say before they're even tested everything's fine I don't know
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.440]  what do you think Obama repeats you can't get Ebola on bus day after bus
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:54.480]  quarantine in DC folks nurses in protective gear got it here and in
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.280]  Spain okay UN workers in total protective gear are getting it
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:04.120]  undoubtedly our troops some of them are gonna get it so Obama's statements are
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:10.280]  just purely hollow Ebola study projects spread of virus on overseas flights
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:21.120]  Wall Street Journal and the computer models show that they believe that it
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.360]  will end up getting on airplanes the upshot is the quote control in the
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.400]  outbreak of the source is the most important thing that needs to happen to
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.800]  prevent the international spread of the virus said Carmen Kahn and infectious
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.200]  disease physician at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and the lead
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:44.160]  author of the study but so let's just let them get on the airplane so I guess
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.120]  CDC's released Ebola gear guidelines that say you need tougher equipment to
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.560]  protect yourself yeah they said you someone could vomit directly on you and
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.360]  if you didn't have an open sore or something you wouldn't get sick total
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:03.840]  bull and meanwhile Ebola patients are just vanishing in places like Liberia
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.320]  they're just throwing them into camps so clearly even mainstream news admits
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:14.160]  there's a cover-up with the real numbers are so that's just some of the news on
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.920]  that front Governor Jindal of Louisiana orders Louisiana to develop Ebola plans
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.680]  Rick Perry has come back out again and said they should shut down the West
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:30.360]  African flights NBC's Snyderman who said just take your bleeping vaccine who got
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:37.560]  caught breaking quarantine faces credibility issues AP reports new Ebola
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.160]  czar will skip congressional hearing Friday after being a no-show at the
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.760]  first two White House Ebola meetings since Obama named him as a point man
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.880]  yeah and he has no medical background but he does think there's too many
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.800]  Africans so that's that's you know he is part of eugenics so he's doing a great
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.560]  job not helping and not showing up let's go to some phone calls then I'll get
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.360]  into what I mentioned earlier time magazine let's fix it let's end human
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:08.760]  driving here's what will happen the initial use of drivers anywhere
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.760]  autonomous cars I call them auto cars will be the companies like uber rather
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.960]  than individually owned they will rapidly gain acceptance because they will
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.320]  save people time imagine all you could do the time currently spent behind the
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.280]  wheel with lower the cost of getting from one place to another and will be way
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.320]  faster while all being safer than human driving sooner after an adoption sky
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.720]  rocket cities will designate areas that are auto car only lanes of highways will
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.360]  become auto car exclusive along for more density driving and higher speeds
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.360]  roughly 10 years from now we will see the end of human driving the seminal
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.080]  moment yes as the machines take full control of everything run by who the
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:55.360]  globalist who want us dead the ghost run in this machine is BLZ bub not a good
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.200]  system and they've got a good globalist can't get on a train can't get in a car
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.640]  your whole house will be wired with everything in it already to track and
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.400]  spy and tax you and surveil you I mean it's just a nightmare system and we're
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.520]  letting them build it so we better shut it down as consumers now before their
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.680]  Panopticon Skynet's in place Chris at Georgia on Ebola you're on the air

[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.920]  really think he was the one that broke this originally had a book called AIDS
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:51.200]  in Ebola and I remember in his lectures that he gave us he held up his book and
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.600]  he said and I have the contracts the contracts to prove that this stuff was
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.840]  made artificially in this book and I bought one of the books I don't have it
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.440]  anymore I gave it to him I mean we played a BBC clip earlier and went over
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.800]  articles where they have these scientists admitting the weaponized Ebola and
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.760]  other things so that's on info wars.com right now but I hear you I

[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:37.680]  let's go to Dave in Florida you're on the air worldwide welcome hi Alex thanks
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.440]  for taking my call I'm literally right now I am drinking my nation I die in a
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:49.520]  hex to my DNA for a supermail literally feeling like I did in my high school
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:56.600]  sports days I was a literal beast so here's my business my friend you
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.240]  literally exposed almost every plan and the end game major plan but what the
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:08.120]  people need is a dynamic list of the people behind it dynamic regarding its
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.880]  ability to be updated quickly with information regarding these alleged
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:19.320]  crimes against humanity as everyone in my belief is innocent until proven guilty
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.280]  so it's worth to prove that guilt evidence is the key no I agree with you
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.600]  that's why I've never made a list of the people that are at the top of the New
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.640]  World Order because you would need to compile the evidence on each one and
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:39.600]  that's so time-consuming but Prince Charles Prince Philip Ted Turner David
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.400]  Rockefeller George Soros they've all admitted they want a planetary regime to
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.800]  cut off the resources and reduce the population 80 to 90 percent they all
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:54.000]  work to take our guns they all work to rig different markets and create
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.320]  poverty and people like Soros are admitted top Nazi collaborators but he
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.520]  gave a bunch of money to the ADL and others out of his hordes he hauled out
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:09.240]  of Europe and so he's allowed to go on 60 minutes and admit he ran you know
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.720]  the roundup of Jews and so he gets to run media matters you know basically
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.760]  calling for me to be arrested and you know MSNBC calling you know saying I'm a
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:24.240]  terrorist because I mean I here I am my grandfather's both fought the Nazis one
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:29.480]  of them flew a fighter plane the other be 17s and also liberators both of them
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:35.240]  almost died so I can sit here and be attacked by a Nazi who just won't hurry
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.520]  up and die so I mean I think we can officially say George Soros is a
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.120]  criminal and there's a piece of trash and but I don't even something happened to
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.160]  him nothing would happen to the New World Order because he's already got
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.720]  all his like his minions under him and his all the rest of it I've just had
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:53.280]  enough of it and I'm even looking for trouble from Soros it's that he's
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.240]  coming after me my guns my family my everything he just won't go away I
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.960]  mean what kind of justice is that the both my grandfathers who were great
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.520]  loving hard-working men are dead and that giant piece of garbage is still
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:13.040]  crawling around like a 200 pound cockroach I'm sorry go ahead no don't
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.040]  apologize Alex well first off my you know my grandparents did fight for our
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:23.720]  country as well and World War two Korea etc. George Soros like he said is crawling
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:30.960]  around like a cockroach he will and has and will get his his lot in life what
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.680]  he has put in he will get out he will you will reap what he sow I mean I'm not
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.800]  seeing literally runs MSNBC and media matters I mean I just can't handle it I
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.720]  just can't handle it can't either man I can't either that's why I watch I'm
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.240]  watching via prison point of TV right now on my day off I'm hard-working you
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.800]  know contributed to society but you know what I guess I'm almost as good to the
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.640]  stuff I can't stop it's like it's like watching a car crashing slow you know
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.640]  why you can't get away from it it's reality we're supposed to watch Madison
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:06.360]  Avenue and all the dramas and all the PR and all the mindless Kardashians
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.560]  meanwhile there's a universe around us a criminal elite sitting on top of us
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.520]  there's so much good and so much bad the real world is happening around us and
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.080]  any man who's got his head halfway screwed on straight would not be able to
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.440]  stop learning how the world works see most guys learn how the sports teams

[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.920]  absolutely right the more you learn the more you want to learn but Rothkopf
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.760]  wrote a book called superclass about the 6,000 world elite I'd say that's a
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:43.720]  pretty accurate book he's the head of the Kissinger Group about 6,000 people
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:49.920]  that are doing this to us and they're a bunch of trash we're on the March the

[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:46.160]  drug use was very low but you had people that abused it
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.440]  they made it all illegal so select groups could bring it in
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.680]  and charge 20 30 times that's why all the big drug dealers out there
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.840]  interviewed by kevin booth and others uh that have aired on showtime shows
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.720]  say we don't want drugs legalized well rick ross does because he understands
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.240]  that it's a weapon system now who would blame somebody if the government's
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.560]  involved make money themselves on it but they use it to imprison people they
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:13.280]  use it to control whole populations and
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.840]  the reason the story of gary webb was so important
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.960]  is rick ross had the courage to tell the truth even though he was thrown in
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.720]  prison longer for it and abused for it and even though his family was
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.680]  threatened and he was threatened gary webb who i knew well we were going to
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:30.480]  build a website together he'd been a frequent guest
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.000]  he had quit the san jose mercury news he was writing another book
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.080]  proving government money laundering and and the worldwide crime cartel
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.280]  he told me a few months before he goes i'm not coming back onto my book comes
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.800]  out but i got to hide my stuff they keep breaking in my house
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.000]  rick ross talked to him a month before he got his head blown off
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.880]  he said guys were breaking in okay and then the media tried to demonize us when
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:56.880]  that came out look we're telling the truth folks and the
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.880]  good news is like a phoenix gary webb has risen from the ashes
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.560]  and one of the top films in the country is exposing it and i got to tell you i
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.920]  didn't think it'd be this accurate it could have been a little more hardcore
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.760]  but it got about as hardcore as i could imagine uh jeremy renner
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.960]  produced it and stars in it i'm such a big fan of him now
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.440]  i liked him in hurtlocker and in the the uh born movie but man i tell you
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:25.040]  if you knew gary if you followed the case it freaked me out to see it
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.960]  because i'm somebody who's in the weird club of being death-threaded myself
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.360]  and so is rick ross so rick what was it like for you to see this film of your
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360]  old friend gary webb who was there at your trial and the rest of it
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.560]  what was it like to be to go through this saga and 10 years after they killed him
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:45.280]  to be vindicated what is it like for you my friend
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.120]  well you know just just the whole thing when when when it came out that gary
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.280]  was accurate and that the cia admitted i i never thought in my wildest dreams that
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.120]  this guy would have admitted that they so drunk
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.720]  so with that coming out and then gary had dreamed because he said so many people
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.000]  you know don't read books and he always wanted a movie to come out
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  and just to see that that his dream came true after all these years and that
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.680]  somebody had the courage you know i met germy renner at uh
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:18.240]  in new york at one of the screenings and uh you know i had to tell him man thanks
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.760]  for having the courage and and you know just the
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.880]  communas to stand up man when everybody might go against you
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:30.400]  that's right they tried to manipulate the film that came out but two weeks
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:34.240]  before it was released the cia declassified that they indeed did target
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.040]  web to destroy him embarrassing moles like the editor of the la times that
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.080]  lied for them uh incredible what all did you talk
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.000]  about with renner and then give us your take when you saw the film
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.880]  well well we talked about uh the nerves that it took
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.720]  you know it takes a lot of nerves uh because basically what germy is doing
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:59.120]  now is he's being like gary web you know he's he's being uh
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:04.160]  almost like a whistleblower or an activist you know for for right
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.800]  uh oh yeah it's dangerous make no mistake so for him to make a move like
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.880]  that you know it i mean it could cause him his career
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.800]  and and you know uh it's just you know it's just
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.920]  challenging you know because i know because i know how people started to
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.880]  treat me you know when when when gary had found
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.040]  all this information and gary connected me to the story i didn't find this
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.880]  story uh i knew absolutely nothing about the cia
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:35.680]  but when it all came out everybody started accusing me of talking gerry into
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.280]  making all this stuff up and i'm like i don't know none of this stuff i didn't
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.480]  know who the who the conscious are you know i didn't know who the conscious was
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.880]  i didn't know who who nigger roger was i never been a nigger roger i i knew the
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.760]  guy i was getting my drugs from was from nigger roger was
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.880]  you know i didn't know what the country called nigger roger i was i was
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.080]  illiterate how can i make up all this you know and gary was like well how can
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:59.920]  rick make up these documents and and it was just like
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.720]  so so i could just imagine what germany went through you know and and i just
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:10.240]  have to take his hat off uh you know take my hat off to him and and you know and
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.320]  hope that his career continues to thrive and you know and and our people got to
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:17.520]  get behind people like that man we can't abandon them when when they stick their
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.080]  neck out like this or when you stuck your neck out it's amazing now cia
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.040]  aircraft of crash repeatedly in mexico and other areas
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.880]  loaded with cocaine that was in roiders they now admit our government grows the
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.120]  opium in afghanistan and ships and in that's even on fox news i mean the
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.640]  vindication of gary webb and you uh and countless other whistleblowers
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:43.280]  who are exposing government narcotics trafficking uh why do you think the cia
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.400]  has come out and admitted they bring in the narcotics and laundered the money
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.240]  why do you think they came out admitted they targeted gary webb and declassified
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:53.760]  that three weeks ago two weeks before it came out well i mean that's crazy why
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.760]  do you think that's happening well you know gary gary's information was so
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.320]  strong that that it was going to be worse if they if they if they if they lie
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.480]  you know a lot of times it's better once you get caught in the cookie jar to
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.680]  just admit it and and and then they knew i guess they knew too you know that uh
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.640]  because you know in my documentary that we've been doing you know we have gary's
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.520]  last interview and gary says in his interview
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:22.160]  is that it's really crazy with our new media system is that the cia has
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:27.040]  admitted that they sold drugs and nobody knows about
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.560]  incredible and and back then though they oh it's a conspiracy theory even though
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:33.360]  he had secret federal documents even though he went to nicaragua
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.040]  and talked to the king pens they tried to go back and say he was a liar
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.160]  what was it like for you to see an actor playing you
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:44.400]  though i think pulled pulled it off pretty well to see renner pull off web so
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.600]  well i almost got a sick feeling watching it though
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:52.320]  because it was like not a documentary but it was more real than real
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:56.240]  and then i felt threatened by it i don't usually get concerned but
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.560]  it made me think man they've been threatening to kill me i know they've
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.520]  been threatened to come after you didn't you feel also
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.280]  almost like some kinship like like we were almost seeing a ghost
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.400]  watching this movie absolutely absolutely uh definitely it felt
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.920]  really really weird and and you know i was in a theater with his wife and his
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:20.960]  kids and and you know uh we had got to meet and and and
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.120]  it was just a really really eerie feeling you know it was almost like
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.480]  uh gary spirit was was was there and was thriving and was like
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.480]  you know keep it going you know and and you know he gave me the courage to even
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.600]  go harder you know and i hope other news reporters
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.920]  you know uh the part that i like you know when he stood up and he said you
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:45.120]  know uh i started off writing two stories
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:49.200]  um one about a dog and one about a horse and
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.840]  uh when i found out at the end that it wasn't what it was supposed to be in
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:57.520]  and that journalism is not what i thought it was
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:01.680]  and and i'm resigning you know and and he basically
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.560]  uh you know took a shot at all these journalists that
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:08.880]  you know are out here in in one report the truth accurately
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:12.800]  because they're not really journalists they're masquerading as journalists
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.800]  yeah exactly they were never really in the arena like a journalist or like a
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.000]  top drug dealer i mean people consider and shake their finger at you and say
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.280]  oh listen to him he was one of the biggest cocaine dealers ever
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:26.640]  but then they don't even get mad at the cia that was shipping an end to attack a
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.960]  community it just shows the disconnect they don't they just get mad at me or
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:34.080]  you shouldn't have been out of jail you know people tell me all the time i'm
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:39.040]  like i did 20 years in prison and well you shouldn't have never got out
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.080]  but then meanwhile what about the cia on record bringing it in
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.800]  they don't they don't make that connection they don't they don't feel like
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.640]  that they should hold their government responsible or or the people who were
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.800]  empowered responsible that'd be like if a mafia don ordered somebody to deal
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.080]  drugs and they dealt the drugs and then that person gets caught and goes to
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.720]  prison but the mafia don is admittedly behind it but doesn't get in trouble
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.560]  that's exactly how it is and that's exactly how i feel right now uh
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:11.200]  you know we have so many people in jail right now for for selling drugs you know
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.040]  no violence no guns didn't kill anybody didn't put a gun in nobody's
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.960]  face just for selling drugs and something like
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:22.720]  two million people a million people we have in prison right now and and you
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.080]  know like 600 000 of those people are young black men
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:32.400]  uh a first-time offender and uh it's really crazy
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:36.320]  and all they're getting is an education and crime and their whole lives ruined
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.000]  and then the government set the whole thing up to control society
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.200]  how else can you lock people up it's nothing but another form
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.400]  of modern slavery shifting gears back into the film
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.240]  what part of the film killed the messenger uh touched you the most
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.120]  and again we're talking to freeway ricky ross the real rick ross
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.200]  here on air honored to have him rick it was absolutely the part where gary
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:00.960]  when they gave gary the award and and and he pretty much
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:04.800]  uh told all of them to go go go to hell
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:08.640]  when when he got the award and he got up and he gave his design letter and he
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.800]  told him that he was still with it uh you know it i mean i could imagine how
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.000]  that felt when everybody that you thought were your friends all go
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.320]  against you um i mean it must have been awful
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:24.240]  feeling it it really like i sunk because i know when i was in prison and
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.920]  and i got my life sentence how uh i didn't have any friends you know gary
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:31.680]  webb was one of the few people that said you know would even sit down and talk
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:37.360]  to me so uh i felt his pain i want to get this on record
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.960]  because we got attacked right up front trying to shut us up but i had you on a
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.280]  few days after i think it was from prison or was it from
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.040]  prisoner and you just it was from prison i was an idea you did me from prison
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:51.840]  and you did me the the first day or the second day that i got out
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.360]  that's right we were honored to have you but but for me i remember you talking
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.880]  about stuff he told me that he was getting threats and they were breaking
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.880]  in and he was having to move tell folks what he told you right before he got
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:06.640]  killed he was telling me about people following around and
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.320]  people on home poles around this house and and
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.520]  um it was really weird going through his paperwork and
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.160]  and um going back you know when he go and talk to people they would go back
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.360]  and and talk to the people and then the people wouldn't talk to him anymore
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.240]  or whatever uh well you know even in in my trial you know uh
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.760]  when the nillo came up and it's a time where he's supposed to talk to
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.520]  my lawyer and uh he wouldn't do it he just told him
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:37.200]  he clamped up and said he didn't have anything to say to him so it was like
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.360]  they were going around telling people not to talk to gary
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.960]  do you have any doubt i mean in your gut do you think you really committed
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:50.000]  suicide or did they kill him i mean my gut feeling is that
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.040]  that they killed him uh because for me i think it's pretty hard to shoot
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.840]  yourself in the head twice i mean i don't think that it that is possible
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.880]  you know you you shoot yourself in the head and then you don't get it done but
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:08.320]  you're conscious enough to uh pick the gun up well i talked to him
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:11.520]  right right before you did because i was trying to get him back on the show and
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.800]  he said wait till my new book proving everything comes out
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:18.400]  and then i'm ready but i want you to put up this website with all the documents
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.520]  so people can go online and and and not just get the book
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.280]  and so i was like okay uh and he was getting irritated with
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.000]  i'm sorry tell me about the new book too so he doesn't have a new book to
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.360]  vindicate himself coming out and he's calling me to build a website and then
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.680]  he blows his head off it doesn't make any sense
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.520]  yeah i mean it was you know i was really shocked when kevin boof uh you know i
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.520]  was talking to kevin boof when it happened uh and i called kevin at night
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:47.280]  and he told me and and it just blew my mind that uh
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.040]  uh you know i just like lost one of my one of my dear friends
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:57.920]  um so it was really mind-blowing did it creep you out too thinking man they
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:02.640]  could try to kill you as well it did it did i mean and you know and
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.560]  that was one of the things that i know you you you helped me with when uh
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.000]  you made it very clear on air uh you asked me
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.920]  i remember you one of the craziest things anybody ever asked me uh
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:18.880]  are you attempting suicide or do you feel suicidal and i was like
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:26.880]  no i love life i'm glad to be living um so yeah it absolutely did creep me out

[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.960]  that's why it's so important to say i will never commit suicide i love life
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.000]  same thing with you and all of us and gary uh was not suicidal i think it's
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.760]  important to show what a hero he was because the film accurately shows
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.040]  i know you guys got threatened outside the courtroom he did that wasn't in the
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:50.720]  film but they did threaten his kids in the movie we know that happened
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:53.440]  and gary didn't back down when they threatened his kids and folks that takes
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.280]  a lot of courage i know gary's a bulldog
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.560]  and just for the record i am not planning on committing suicide
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.360]  matter of fact as you know i got a new book out myself

[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:25.040]  and he's also they got films in the works and a lot more kevin boost also made
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.400]  documentaries with him that have aired on showtime you name i i need to get
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:31.440]  kevin booth back on uh who was the guy that helped me
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.200]  interview you in prison which was pretty amazing
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.640]  he's got of course sacred cow production sacred cow dot com
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.880]  certainly breaking the sacred cows rick my point is it's hypocritical
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.160]  to put nonviolent people it wasn't like you were scarface
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.320]  you were more of a you know executive you know type guy uh you know at a level
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:54.000]  even above that violence is in the drugs because it's
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.360]  illegal all the studies show you decriminalize
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.200]  it ends it it so so what about all these people in prison
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.320]  i know you've been lobbying out there to try to change the laws tell us what
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:08.320]  you've been up to right well i felt that that that is crazy
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.920]  to keep the guys in prison that that didn't hurt anybody
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.440]  that didn't actually go up and robin put a gun in your face or rape you or
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.960]  something like that but what they do is they let these kind of guys out of
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.880]  deal the guys that are raping and child molesters you know they go to
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.560]  jail they get two years and slap on the wrist because they're making room in
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.000]  prison to keep the drug dealers and i think that it
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.240]  it's crazy because drug dealers in general in the prison industry know it
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.120]  already they have a study that they did and they said drug dealers are not
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:40.400]  violent when the majority they are some that are violent but the majority of
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.840]  them are not violent that they're just people trying to make a living
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:48.640]  uh and trying to be productive well if you make it illegal people are
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.000]  going to get into it and i mean it's so obvious
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.440]  and then real criminals are going to get involved as well but they'd be criminals
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.760]  regardless i mean look if they decriminalize if they decriminalized
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:04.080]  as a former top drug kingpin what would it do to the industry
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:07.760]  it would drive the price down to where most people wouldn't want to it would
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.480]  it would be like you know trying to sell cigarettes
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.000]  you know it's so cheap that it's not worth it
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.960]  or even less than that even so so when they when they the more that they
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:22.400]  incarcerate they go around to a neighborhood and they
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.040]  and they arrest all the drug dealers from that neighborhood
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.400]  where as soon as that happened the price of the drugs go up once the price of
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:31.200]  the drugs go up and it looks more attractive to the people in the
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:35.280]  community to get them off exactly that's how you
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:39.520]  create the huge criminal economy is is having the drugs to begin with be
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:43.120]  illegal exactly so you put an artificial price
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.920]  on something that's worth nothing and then you make it worth 100 000
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.240]  and then the big banks launder the money while the youth kill each other
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:57.760]  yep and go to prison and work in the factory
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.720]  and then all the good old boys go make them intercity people work in the
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.560]  prison for 25 cents an hour taking their job away on the outside
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:08.160]  i mean this this drug war is killing this country right yeah you're right
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:10.960]  because now they take the jobs from the people on the street and they put them
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:14.400]  inside the prison and and on the street they won't get you that job
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.960]  because it's a 25 hour job but in prison they'll pay you 25 cents an hour
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:23.040]  and give you that same job for 30 years and they said they'd like to give guys
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.600]  a lot of time because once they train them
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.720]  they don't have to retrain anybody for a long time that's right they're good
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.120]  slaves that that's what it is folks free ricky ross rick ross
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:38.320]  book.com and folks need to get his new book today
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:41.520]  my only concern is for people that didn't know web
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.680]  didn't follow it uh the film's just powerful it only gets you know seven
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.320]  and a half stars which is very high on imdb folks
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.480]  if you knew the inside case like i do or even more like rick ross does
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:55.520]  i got to give it nine out of ten stars i mean it's an amazing film do you agree
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.240]  with that rick i agree i agree with you you look at it
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.440]  like this here uh none of the major studios would touch it
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:05.440]  you know it took a guy like germy to to to get involved and
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:09.760]  to volunteer itself you know i already volunteered his time he didn't get paid
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:13.280]  it was a uh a work of love and it took something like this they
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:16.320]  make it happen because none of the big wigs you know the guy that's tied in
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.720]  with the government we're going to let it happen
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:23.120]  but it shows they don't run the show that much anymore because it came out

[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:08.480]  fantasy of paradise on earth there's no place like utopia is a humorous and
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.960]  horrifying exploration of progressive amnesty for illegals
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.680]  so-called race relations radical islam political correctness barack obama

[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:25.040]  should be close quote but is utopia a real destination for america
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.520]  or does the true path to happiness still remain with faith family and hard work

[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:16.400]  and a plan to take over society by a bunch of parasites and foreign banks
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:19.760]  just because you know that doesn't mean young people know it or your neighbors
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:24.320]  know it or your church knows it people don't learn this by osmosis magically
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.800]  you've got to get it into their hands you've got to be an info warrior

[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.600]  to do it you haven't heard me promote films in a while because there haven't
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:44.400]  been that many good ones out there this one is excellent

[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:05.280]  i mean just the mind control of these control freaks is really getting
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:09.520]  obvious as uh obama gets booed at his own events people
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.840]  leaving mass uh he now is no longer the messiah that jamie
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:17.360]  fox called him so what do you expect him to do

[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:01.440]  time so it's amazing when i talk to these folks
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:04.880]  especially you know african-american women in chicago
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:08.400]  detroit they're the biggest conservatives in america today
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:11.280]  they don't want any part of their kid smoking marijuana they don't want
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:14.240]  amnesty for illegals they don't want any part of this
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:18.400]  progressive nonsense and uh so i was very inspired once you
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.080]  meet people these are people that if you ever talk to people that just came out
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.000]  of east germany or the soviet union and you say to them hey how would you like
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.960]  a little socialism and they say are you crazy
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:33.440]  so this is the mood in inner-city america as a result of the progressive
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:38.080]  destruction for the past 50 60 years and this film i think
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:42.400]  exposes the progressive agenda and the reality and the roots in the history
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:48.560]  and the mentality of these uh these people that think there's this utopian
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:52.560]  society they're going to create in history we've seen it again and again
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:57.440]  mal Stalin hitler was a utopian and a national socialist
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:02.320]  pull pot they say i've got the perfect formula for social change follow me
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:05.200]  and when you get to the end of that yellow brick road you don't get to
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.360]  paradise you get to hell on earth and that's why a hundred
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.600]  million people were murdered by progressives by utopian progressives in
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:18.720]  the 20th century trying to force humanity to fit into their
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:22.960]  fantasy of utopia i hope this film will make an impact and really educate
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  people it's a lot of fun and uh it really hits home
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:30.720]  well you're right that most so-called democrats i talk to
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:35.840]  uh know that they've been domesticated but at the same time they're angry at
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:38.560]  mainline republicans that are pretty much the same thing
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:44.480]  but now obama has really shown the true face of progressivism so much i think
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:49.440]  he's been a disaster forum and blown up in their face but the problem is
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.520]  the bureaucracy is in place the industries have been shut down the
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.880]  domestication has taken place so it's kind of like we now
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:00.880]  know we're in this hell but how do we get out of it
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.800]  and look i'm i'm not for the drug war because it's another evil
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.160]  but i'm totally against the drug culture that you expose in the film and
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:11.600]  people are like well wait a minute you're against the drug culture but
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.760]  but you're also against the drug war well the drug war the way it runs
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.000]  actually just expands over all the profits so it creates a drug culture
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.960]  but absolutely the uh drug culture and the marijuana culture
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:28.640]  uh that i see out there of people that smoke this weaponized weed
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:32.240]  they're like zombies and i'm a libertarian if they want to you know be
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:35.520]  vegetables that's their issue some adults and people i guess use it
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:38.800]  responsibly has some medical uses but but you know the whole weed crowd
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:42.240]  doesn't understand just because i'm for decriminalization
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:46.800]  doesn't mean i'm endorsing it because i go into these weed havens
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:50.960]  and it is like zombies i mean i've known women that were incredibly dynamic
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:54.400]  beautiful talented couple years into marijuana they
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  look like living dead zombies yeah so i've got my issues with it
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.240]  yeah well certainly the progressives will use anything any tool
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.080]  anything that comes up to exert more control
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:09.440]  well look at george soros he backs the total weed culture because he wants
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:12.800]  dumb zombies right now have you ever been to your high school reunion let's
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:16.720]  say when you were 28 years old or 38 you go back 10 years
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:21.120]  later 20 years later everybody that was smoking weed in high school
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.280]  is pretty much still smoking weed and working in a fast food joint
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:28.960]  it definitely causes problems in development
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:33.760]  in ambition there are many issues with it and the more the progressives can
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:38.240]  promote anything that keeps people from focusing on their radical agenda
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:43.040]  the more they'll get behind it they want folks stunned and stumbling around
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:46.400]  exactly now i think they've gotten away with a lot of stuff the past
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:50.160]  you know six seven years they've got uh the multiculturalism thing they're
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:53.040]  trying to throw amnesty down our throats they want
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:58.480]  transgender you know soldiers and female firefighters which is fine but
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:01.840]  not if you're uh if you're wrong with commandos and tutus i think we should
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:06.240]  have if you need to be carried off of a roof you pretty much a pretty muscular
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.480]  guy if you you need these things but i think they may have met their match
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.120]  on ebola and enterovirus because these things that they're ramming down our
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:17.680]  throat bringing these kids in from south america
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.920]  that are obviously there's gonna there's some connection to this tropical
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:24.960]  disease more people have died from enterovirus
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:29.360]  than ebola and then it comes out of south america and and so we can thank our
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.880]  loving obozo exactly just when school started all
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:36.800]  of a sudden these kids are coming down with this enterovirus so
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:41.200]  i think america is not going to rebel from all these other things but i think
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:44.640]  when you threaten their children and the safety of their children
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:48.000]  and their daily health you can't even get on a plane without looking over your
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.960]  shoulder i think this progressive nonsense
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:54.880]  is finally going to meet a backlash and hopefully we'll find out in a few weeks
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:59.520]  if the regressive suffer a big blow well that's true i mean they say there's
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:03.040]  like hundreds of kids that have died kids on breathing machines tens of
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:07.440]  thousands sick from this jungle virus from south america
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:10.960]  and now they say the flood of illegals is even more than now the jails are
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:14.880]  releasing the illegals everywhere they now busted at the seams
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.360]  it's really true obama is trying to destroy the country cloward and piven
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.360]  they really are trying to scuttle it a progressivism
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:27.040]  this entire ideology is a war against every individual
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.080]  it's a war against women it's war against your mind
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:33.680]  it's a war against america because america
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:38.000]  stand was based on the declaration of independence the bill of rights
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.920]  and we have a great american identity which emanated from this
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:45.920]  which was individual markets free speech limited government
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:49.920]  all of these things they want to destroy because they look at the world
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.920]  differently from normal people we look at the rest of the world and we say
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:59.280]  america is the best place to live we have freedom we have individual rights
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:03.040]  we have our own world that we can create whatever we want to be we can do it in
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:06.640]  america so we love america progressives look at america
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:11.040]  and compare it to a socialist utopia where everything is perfect
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:14.720]  and they conclude they compare it to fantasy land the fantasy land so they
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:17.600]  say we have to destroy america we have to tear it down and
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:21.520]  and destroy it and undermine it and wipe it out so we can start to rebuild this
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.040]  perfect society heaven on earth we don't have to look far back in
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:28.400]  history to see that every time some charlatan like
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.360]  obama like the wizard of us well that's what the zeitgeist movement is we're
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:34.800]  all gonna live in giant plastic dome cities and have a robot computer tell
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:38.800]  us what to do that sounds like hell well it is hell it's it's called a socialist
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:43.280]  hell and you just look back in history every time some charlatan said i've got

[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:21.040]  there's no place like utopia because i have the idea to actually get some of
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:24.960]  the most powerful clips of the film and have him walk us through it
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:29.120]  i like when pbs is doing a film review and they talk about it it's just so
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.720]  important to give this to everybody this christmas or this holiday it is so
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:38.400]  important that we promote the ideas of liberty and show what a disease
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:43.440]  progressivism is it's just like if you feed squirrels at the park they become
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:46.080]  obese they don't know how to feed themselves anymore or it's like
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:50.560]  domesticating wales or something it's just it's it's all done by design and we
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.200]  have the blueprints written by the socialist that this is their plan to
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:59.360]  wreck america and europe and they've done it but what the film shows and this is
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.160]  what i found is the people living under it are rebelling against it

[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.720]  so if you want to get it infowarstore.com
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:25.440]  or 888-253-3139 but but talk more about the film because that to me is the
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.720]  really good news is the people are already rejecting it now they're walking
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:32.480]  out of his events no one in the democratic party wants him around
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:35.920]  uh he's basically canceling fundraisers because even the rich people don't want
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.400]  to hang out with him even though he's a puppet he's the progressive god
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:46.720]  we must pull down this idol correct uh i think just like they did in the days of
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:51.520]  the late fifties early sixties the cold war the
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:56.480]  idea of ronald reagan and others was shed light illuminate show what they're
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:59.600]  really up to when they're screaming peace
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:04.720]  fairness we want to help families you have to shed the light and show that
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:08.800]  they're they're pathological liars their agenda
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:12.560]  is exactly the opposite whatever they say is the opposite
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:15.760]  and when you look at these progressive cities i visit new work
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:19.840]  south side chicago i run into michelle obama's mother is pretty interesting
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.000]  uh you know encounter i meet up with jesse jackson a lot of just regular
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:28.400]  folks in denver uh and they they realize they've been had
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:31.920]  they realize they've been had they know it they just look around and they say
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.360]  things are getting worse and worse and not better
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:39.680]  so the mask is off in the inner cities but a lot of
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:43.280]  i guess the problem is white liberals uh among others
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:47.680]  that is a problem believe in this idea of this fantasy world
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.080]  and they don't understand that reality they're a cult of control freaks
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:56.240]  they they use all kinds of innuendo they become very good at it
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.600]  these radicals these are the 60s radicals who
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.000]  wanted to destroy america the sds weather underground these are the mentors
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.920]  these are the people that slowly took over the democrat party for the last
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.800]  20 30 years since the early 80s these are the heroes and mentors of the people
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:17.120]  running the country today so that today you see from this film that the democrat
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:22.000]  party is a radical socialist party most well-meaning democrats
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.280]  or liberals even my my poor aunt up in san francisco
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:29.680]  lifelong democrat it's hard for them to realize that their party
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.680]  has been taken over by marxist out of chicago
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:37.520]  who are trying to undermine the country rather than again look at fray marshall
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:41.360]  davis his real dad the evidence overwhelming a hardcore worldwide
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:45.360]  communist leader and then they admit that his grandfather would
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.640]  leave him for months in the summers with a
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:52.960]  commie pornographer i mean these people are freaks
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:56.160]  yeah the uh don't forget it was white communists
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:27:59.760]  who decided they would use black people and use minorities
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:04.240]  to join their cause they recruited frank marshall davis obama's father was a
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.800]  journalist in chicago and they used him to promote
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:12.560]  communism and marxism amongst african-american groups
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:15.840]  the same thing was repeated with obama bill ares the
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:18.800]  weatherground marxist terrorist weather underground
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.160]  his father brought obama from new york to chicago
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.960]  to agitate and infiltrate the black church groups who rejected communism
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:30.000]  because it was atheist and they were religious people
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:36.560]  so communism has a sordid uh history of using minorities and using people with
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:40.160]  dark complexions to infiltrate and use those people
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:42.480]  sure sure but our own government of the ford foundation
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:47.120]  and carning endowment started it all with liberation theology and the cia is
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:51.360]  involved as well on one arm of it uh doing this as well it's
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:55.760]  incredible it's a uh you know it's a like the
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:01.120]  hall of shame of all the worst uh group of people and ideologies in america
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:04.000]  have come together under this progressive ideology
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.800]  and they've exerted control over all these cities in america for years
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.600]  and you can just see the destruction uh if only any republican would just
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:17.360]  tell the truth and say look progressivism is a path to hell
[02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:21.680]  and here's the evidence and then there's american values prosperity
[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:25.360]  freedom free markets let's go in this direction
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.040]  and get rid of this progressive agenda which is leading us down this yellow

[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:17.680]  right now per se it's really about breaking news

[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:08.640]  to just be ready to throw in vehicles if Ebola really breaks out
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:12.080]  now i don't think Ebola's going to get that bad here i hope it's getting bad
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:15.440]  in african places but the MRSA all the other crazy stuff
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:20.000]  government not trying to stop it all the things happening in the economy you

[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:26.080]  for my patreon supply dot com that's the place in my view
[02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:29.840]  to get your storeable food super high quality delivered to you quick
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:35.280]  non-gmo uh great people i mean their communications director is a popular
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:41.760]  gcn radio host uh in his own right uh so that just tells you what
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:45.600]  patriots they are uh red hawk who runs the company's been a
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:48.960]  listener for a decade now chris gio um found a
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.400]  truth frequency radio and he's a field of research includes
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:56.480]  economics false flag terror geopolitics and occult agendas
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.800]  and he joins us here on gcn gcm live dot com where he is
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:05.280]  no stranger to many of you because he really burrows in and of course works
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:10.800]  for my patreon supply dot com but they had the feds approach them and i
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:15.200]  talked to other companies that this happened to as well but they
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:18.480]  told me don't tell anybody well i was already working with this
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:21.040]  company so i talked to them and they said yeah we're about to go public with an
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:24.320]  article homeland security last year and this year
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:29.120]  wants to buy everything they can produce and they give you an idea they're now
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:32.160]  the most successful company in the country because it's a better customer
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:34.720]  service better food even though they're not that old of a company
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:38.640]  i don't know four five years whatever it is six years so
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.840]  all of this is going on and then we have an article on drudge report dot com
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:47.600]  yesterday that paul watson wrote so i thought well we better get chris gio on
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:52.080]  or matt red hawk fed stockpile protective gear
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:57.120]  an expectation of emergency event nih fear supply
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:00.960]  of mass gloves to be exhausted well we have a reporter down in new orleans who
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:05.440]  just filed a video that's up on info wars dot com of a firefighter in uniform
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:10.480]  you know there with his wife saying we've been given 300 body bags
[02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:15.120]  he's wearing his firefighter shirt so there's massive preparation going on
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:17.520]  and remember the cdc came out and said they've got these
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:21.200]  multi-person coffins for incineration that are there outside
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:24.800]  atlanta that was confirmed from five years ago that's not a conspiracy theory
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:30.480]  now that was confirmed last week i mean bomb shell stuff going on
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:35.120]  and it really clicked for me i need to talk to probably the most successful
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:38.960]  storable foods company out there
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:44.560]  my patreon supply dot com chris gio but let me give that number out again for

[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:59.200]  they have emergency survival food cop quality water filtration
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:02.400]  survival provisions heirloom siege you notice they carry a lot of the same
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.560]  seeds we do because they carry the best you can also buy the my patreon supply
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:10.560]  line with the same discounts at infowar store
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:14.560]  dot com but i think they have an even bigger selection at my patreon supply
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:19.040]  dot com so go there again chris gio thanks for coming on i'm kind of all over
[02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:22.240]  the map here when we talk to you this morning i just had this wild hair to
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:25.760]  get you on because i wanted to get intel more i'm
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:28.720]  maybe sure what you're going to tell us i mean you sent me an email i had time
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:32.960]  to read it yet i i said i want to get you on at about 11 and then i guess you
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:36.080]  you said oh there is a lot of news but i'm not sure what angle you're coming at
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:39.680]  it from but if the feds are stocking up on food and want everything you can
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:42.400]  produce thank god you're actually selling to the people
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:46.080]  we know with bullets they're going to manufacturers producers and buying
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:48.880]  everything they can produce that's why there's been a bullet shortage for three
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:51.760]  years uh what's really going on here because you're the
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:55.520]  communications director you're a smart guy you got your ear to the ground
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:59.760]  uh i had a hunch just to get you on what's your intel
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:02.800]  oh well thanks for having me on first of all alex and i've got to say we are
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:05.840]  living in some very very interesting times right now
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.240]  over the last five days the mainstream media coverage of this Ebola situation
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:13.520]  seems to have kind of died down a little bit but thankfully people like
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:16.880]  yourself are covering this extensively and bringing the real
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:20.640]  information out there now i find this kind of coincidence that
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:23.840]  the mainstream media coverage is starting to decline right after they
[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:29.520]  appointed rob clane as the Ebola czar um you know the the the great
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:34.080]  cesar obama appointed this this rob clane who's not a doctor
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:37.520]  he's not a medical guy i mean he probably hasn't even removed an ingrown
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:40.400]  toenail much less knows anything about Ebola
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:43.360]  but what he is famous for is covering up the housing bubble
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:46.880]  um several other scandals like that the fake stimulus fanny may
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.200]  he's a cover-up artist he is a cover-up artist and a spin doctor exactly
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:55.440]  so that begs the question what's really going on here and we we know from
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:58.560]  looking at the mainstream media over the last 20 years
[02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:01.760]  that they don't ever tell us the truth we have to go to sources like info wars
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:04.800]  dot com to get the real information so when the mainstream media says there's
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:09.760]  five Ebola victims there's probably 50 or 60
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:14.080]  well that's what my gut tells me is that uh if two nurses got it that's because
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:16.960]  they have a union they know what it is they wouldn't shut up
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:19.920]  the nurses have already been complaining they're in Dallas the
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:24.560]  workers at the airports have been on strike at jfk where people are dying
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:28.160]  vomiting from west africa and before they test them they say nothing to worry
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:31.600]  about i think it's clear there's a cover-up chris how bad is it is the
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:34.960]  question your guess is as good as mine but i do
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:39.200]  know the facts behind the matter are there's a 21 day incubation period some
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:43.520]  say as as much as 24 days where a person can be infected with Ebola
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:47.680]  they're not saying 41 the CDC now says 41 but sorry go ahead
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:50.880]  see exactly that's exactly what i'm talking about so we could have a lot
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.680]  more people who are actually infected and not showing signs
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:57.040]  walking around i mean personally i just flew across the country and i was
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:00.640]  looking over my shoulder watching out for people coughing and i like to think
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:04.160]  that i keep my my ear to the ground as you said and my finger on the pulse of
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:07.280]  situations but when i even started looking around
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:11.280]  and somewhat of a panic i mean i don't want to live in a complete panic but in
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.880]  somewhat of a panic or concern that's a better way to put it
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:18.160]  then you've got to take that to the bank because you've got to think about this
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:21.920]  too when truckers and pilots and other people that are
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:24.880]  moving products across country when you know when they're stocking up the
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:27.680]  walmarts and the grocery stores and things like that
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:31.760]  if something breaks out are those people willing to drive into an infected area
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:34.800]  to deliver food so we know what happened in in
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:38.800]  four different nations is in five total but in four it's causing your
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:43.360]  collapse in society just from the panic alone that's another reason
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:47.360]  people need to be prepared government prepares and calls it reasonable when
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:50.480]  we prepare they call it very bad and evil
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.560]  why do they want us so dependent when hurricane sandy hit the east coast
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:58.160]  they beg for FEMA to come for weeks wouldn't help them Katrina they came and
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.440]  took the guns i mean why does government want us so
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:06.160]  unprepared chris oh because they want to come in as the savior of course they
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:08.960]  want to come out looking yeah oh absolutely they
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:12.560]  they're it's mommy and daddy government that's the way they want us to see them
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:16.960]  uh they're the saviors we we shouldn't be prepared we shouldn't be independent
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:20.080]  nothing like that rely on them a hundred percent and
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:23.760]  i'm not willing to do that personally i i moved out to to the woods
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:27.920]  in an undisclosed location in the rocky mountains i've got my storable food here
[02:42:27.920 --> 02:42:32.000]  and i feel really good i feel prepared i feel like i can take care of my family
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:35.040]  and i know that if something breaks out here in colorado springs or denver or
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:38.080]  any of these surrounding areas i don't have to go there i don't even have to
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:41.040]  go to the grocery store because i have everything that i need here
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:44.960]  and it's really about being uh independent i mean that's
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:49.280]  if you're not prepared then you're going to definitely fall into whether it's a
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:52.560]  bola or some kind of hurricane or some kind of disaster
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:56.160]  you're just setting yourself up for failure well i see a bola as a good prep
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:59.280]  for everybody to realize how unstable things are and how there is some
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:02.640]  deadly smallpox or a bola they're going to just leave the flights open
[02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:06.000]  they're going to let kids go to school whose dad has it they're going to just
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.440]  do everything they can to spread it bare minimum they're trying to let it
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.480]  spread a lot of folks like frances boil who wrote the
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:16.800]  biological weapons treaty for the u.s dr boil is saying it clearly looks
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.000]  staged uh we've got wane madson formerly the nsa
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:23.600]  saying looks staged we have all these other medical experts saying it looks
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:27.120]  staged uh you have a history of south africa and the cia
[02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:31.200]  creating weaponized a bola this appears to have mutated and to be somewhat
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:36.080]  weaponized we have a new army report out on info wars dot com that's red linked
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:38.880]  by kit daniels i want to put it back as the top story
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:42.160]  it's so bombshell and it's gotten no attention of course
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.880]  a bola can spread by air in cold weather and i want to go over some of that
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:50.720]  report in a moment uh but but chris this is a big deal
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:54.160]  now now specifically last year and again this year
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:57.360]  you guys even published the letters and some of the info homeland security
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:00.720]  wanted to buy everything that my patreon supply dot com is one of the
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.680]  biggest uh makers of storable food in the country
[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:08.080]  they wanted to buy up everything you had we know other suppliers they did these
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:10.480]  deals with but they wanted to do that with the
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:15.040]  government uh and they didn't say just scale up
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:17.760]  and then give us this scale and produce to others no
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:20.800]  shine a contract to scale up and give us whatever you can make so
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:24.240]  while they're hoarding food they act like it's weird if we prep
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:27.680]  even though i saw articles this week that prepping's gone mainstream i think it
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:32.480]  was the new york times uh what's going on that you can tell us
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:35.920]  about homeland security trying to buy up all your food well i can tell you this
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.320]  for sure and and i hope the ceo doesn't mind me
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:41.520]  speaking on his behalf but we're willing to burn down our entire
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:45.840]  warehouse before selling to the feds that's our position we will never sell
[02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.440]  to the feds but i did speak to them firsthand as a
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:53.360]  communications director i recorded it even put it up on youtube because we
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:56.400]  we want to put this information out for everybody so we actually have the
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:59.840]  conversation out there they're preparing for something big
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:03.680]  um he gave me several different scenarios when we spoke everything from
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:08.720]  uh an outbreak of some kind of pandemic to a mass hurricane or disaster
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:12.160]  something that can take out quote unquote the tri-level states
[02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:15.120]  so they're preparing for something big and you're absolutely right this Ebola
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:18.560]  situation if it does spread the way we believe that it's going to spread
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:23.120]  it is a manufactured crisis and um that makes it even even scary
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:26.800]  other because when the federal government is willing
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:30.160]  to release something like this here in the united states
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:32.560]  that's when you know you're living under tyranny that's when you know that's
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:36.560]  right it's a litmus test commodity yes exactly i mean either they're the most
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:40.080]  inept people in history or they're pure evil i mean you just either way you're
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:44.480]  in trouble yes yes what what what concerns me though
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:48.160]  who officials and doctors without borders they're
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:52.000]  saying that this thing is mutating as fast as the flu i think that if this is
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.440]  a government contrived situation they're going to release something that
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:59.200]  they're not going to be able to later control and it's going to just get
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:03.280]  completely out of proportion and and even outside of their control so
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:06.960]  well before this happened in the last six months before even
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:10.000]  i said i'm having the most anxiety i've ever had
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.040]  and i said it could be biological nukes are missing
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:16.480]  other funding al-qaeda the borders wide open i mean you just look at what
[02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:21.200]  they're doing they are destroying this country europe has blocked the flights
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:24.080]  for two months countries bordering it have
[02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:28.080]  blocked it but they won't block the flights chris i mean
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:31.360]  it's so obvious look at what they did in katrina
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:34.720]  they quarantined that entire area they were shooting people who were trying to
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:38.640]  get across that bridge they they disarmed everybody first of all
[02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:41.920]  if this breaks out the way that it could break out we could
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:46.240]  essentially be looking at dozens if not hundreds of katrina type situations
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:50.960]  isolated all over the country and just like one supposed bomber from the
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:54.160]  boston bombings they locked down literally half the city and dragged
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:57.120]  women out by their hair pointing machine guns at them that don't even look like
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:03.600]  suspects or one dorner shooting cops uh one crazy cop and so they're shooting
[02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:07.440]  blonde haired women and and and his spanish women that don't even look like
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:10.800]  dorner just ran it just shows hysteria in government
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:15.200]  can you imagine how this will blow up they've been gearing up for this and i
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.640]  know this sounds very very strange but october 2013 the dhs and the cdc
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:24.880]  actually did a drill down in the southern california area
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:29.120]  where they were combating quote unquote zombies they literally had a thousand
[02:47:29.120 --> 02:47:33.120]  people dressed up like zombies now take the zombie aspect out of it for just a
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:36.480]  second what do you have left you have people that are infected with some kind
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.720]  of virus that the dhs and the cdc have been gearing up to actually fight
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:44.160]  absolutely now admit that that it's it's politically incorrect to show abola
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.640]  victims being shot begging for food and water as people are like after a week
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:51.840]  they turn into what essentially zombies but they're living undead just out of
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.080]  their minds crazy and so now we learn all over the world including africa
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:58.640]  they're training to kill zombies before this happened
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:02.320]  so so that was the cover story but like train to kill zombies
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:06.640]  well it turns out that's the simulant for disease people it's a fact
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:10.480]  exactly exactly so we need to start looking at all these situations very
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:13.520]  very seriously and i think they throw in things like zombies to
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:18.320]  make people go oh that's crazy zombies you're talking about a zombie virus
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:21.920]  and so people just automatically dismiss that they had an article last week
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:25.680]  attacking me saying jones thinks the government's training to fight zombies
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.360]  when it was an ap roiders everywhere but then when we point out what they're
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:34.800]  doing oh we're lying chris right right right the nurses know the nurses in
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:37.680]  spain i'm sure you heard about that situation where they just threw their
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:40.240]  hands up check their gloves off and said we're not going to do this anymore
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:42.400]  because we're going to go and we're going to infect our families

[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:19.680]  happens i get them on earlier than i get guessed on i'll do a little bit overdrive
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:25.760]  to go to you kevin and donna uh and uh
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:29.280]  dylan and philip i'll try to get to everybody finishing up with chris gio
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:34.480]  chris we'll have to keep track of this with you as we go along but
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:37.520]  i'm just surprised at so many other food companies we talked to
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:40.720]  just basically quit selling because all they do is sell to homeland security
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:44.080]  and they're getting body bags ready everywhere and martial law ready
[02:55:44.080 --> 02:55:48.160]  i mean maybe it's just a big boondoggle uh in the federal government but
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:51.680]  i've never seen such a gearing up as we've said in the last year here and
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:55.200]  i remember you in that recording that they were that you guys released boldly
[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:59.520]  with homeland security that they talked about a pandemic
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:03.040]  i'm just really worried about hysteria with the flu being misidentified as a
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:05.760]  bola any other points you think should be added
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:09.600]  uh as the communications director for my patreon supply dot com
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:13.760]  well i i think it goes the opposite as well that some people who are diagnosed
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.120]  with say flu could actually have Ebola symptoms or something like that
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:20.880]  but they're saying it's flu or something else just to try to keep the numbers
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:24.640]  down that is also a possibility now i don't have anything to back that up a
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:28.400]  hundred percent but we have to speculate in these regards as well we have to
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  think from every perspective and we have to think like a chess player ultimately
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:35.600]  what's the next move they're going to make but also what's the next five moves
[02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:38.960]  they're going to make um i would just say to the audience that
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:42.400]  we have to make sure to separate ourselves from fear because fear is the
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:45.840]  mind killer and when they put you in that fear like state then you're acting
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:49.760]  erratically and you're acting based on emotion we have exactly they act like
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:53.920]  we're scared when we own guns and we have food and we have supplements and
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:58.320]  we have water filtration well i mean old timers all had that and can food and
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:02.880]  had guns and a root seller i mean ants save food
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:07.120]  honeybee save food i mean that any species that's smart
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:10.560]  and wants to survive does that they're trying to run that out of us
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:14.160]  saying we're weird and we're living in fear no it's the opposite people always
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.040]  say you're really paranoid must be afraid of everything
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:20.960]  no i know there's corruption so i'm fighting it if i was paranoid i would
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:25.280]  shut up and go along with it go ahead sorry exactly exactly now i know me
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:29.040]  personally having a couple of years of storable food having enough ammunition
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:32.000]  and everything else that i need now instead of worrying about where am i
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.200]  going to get food from i can worry about what am i going to do what's going
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:38.000]  to be my next move i have my food i can put it in my car
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:41.760]  the these these three month supplies are great i mean they you can really carry
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:44.880]  them i can carry two in one hand and just throw them right in the back of any
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:48.560]  small car and i can get anywhere that i need to go and i know that i'm taking
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:52.400]  care of as a matter of fact i keep um a couple of weeks in my car as an
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:56.080]  emergency in case we get snowed in somewhere sure and you don't be an
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.120]  expert to do this exactly and you don't be experts to do this

[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:05.680]  place is trying to like help you but yet they're
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:10.080]  you know they're forcing hospitals have the worst nutrition and major studies
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:13.120]  in the world here in the united states but the worst period not just for
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:16.480]  hospitals and then government hospitals and the
[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:21.040]  va have the worst of that nutrition they will listen diet coax we knew 30 years
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:24.720]  ago cause diabetes eat your pancreas and make you obese
[03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:28.480]  major studies came out this year and even cbs news had to admit it
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:32.720]  so yes and then vaccines cause pancreatitis in many cases one of the
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:36.400]  most common autoimmune responses other than blood on the brain and
[03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:40.320]  gut problems most people who have crones it's from the measles
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:44.560]  mumps and rebella shot major studies on that uh and so yeah people that are
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:48.320]  getting shots five six times a year you can bet your bottom dollar their
[03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:52.080]  pancreas is better than a hammer and that's just how it works god bless you
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:56.240]  good to hear from you donna in new hampshire you're on the air go ahead
[03:01:56.240 --> 03:01:59.760]  hi elix thanks for taking my call i want to tell you that i love all of your
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:03.200]  products i'm doing all of them and our family up here is doing
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.040]  wonderful and we're going to keep our immune system the best we can
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:10.960]  i wanted to bring to your attention that monica lawinsky
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:15.520]  is going around the circuit saying that drudge ruined her life that's all that
[03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:19.680]  pure bull i thought it was bill clinton doing stuff to her in her line
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:23.520]  that's that's exactly right i mean yeah she's going around and she and
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:27.200]  and then she's saying that drudge is a bully you know now they're trying to
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:31.120]  do internet um bully you know cyberbullies and
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:35.040]  they're going to try to take down put more control on the internet for this
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:38.720]  that's it and she's the new poster girl that if something hurts your feelings
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:41.840]  she's in there having sex with a married man in the wine house
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:45.280]  she was connected to israeli intelligence a bunch of other stuff
[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:48.320]  and then drudge puts it out it breaks how is that his fault
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.000]  that's what journalists are supposed to do when it's the president
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.880]  and and then people can decide what they want to do about it and it's not like
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:59.360]  it was one woman clinton was like reporters settling
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:03.120]  cases of raping women and you know in the in the
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:07.520]  linked bedroom with all these movie stars and the issue is black male of the
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:10.720]  president i mean i don't get in people's issues of
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:14.320]  infidelity and stuff like that you know that's it's a free country doesn't mean
[03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:18.560]  i endorse it either it's just that the issue is the word is he was
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:22.240]  being blackmailed with that information and so drudge is a hero
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:27.040]  and a bellwether of the new media and that's why they hate him so good point
[03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:31.040]  yeah and that i just wanted to bring that up because they are really chomping at
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:34.000]  the bit to go after the alternative media
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.760]  your crew is doing the best job ever um i'm seeing info war stickers all the way
[03:03:39.760 --> 03:03:43.200]  through new ham sure so keep up the good work god bless your
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:47.040]  crew no god bless you please don't thank me ma'am i want to thank you
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:50.800]  you are just as important as i am you're a journalist too like a fellow that shot
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:54.400]  the video of the firefighters saying they got 300 body bags in their town for
[03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:58.240]  abola i mean you are just as important as i am just as
[03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:01.920]  important as matt drudge is just as important as the new york times is as
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:05.520]  matt has always said and it's it's the things
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:09.840]  drudge says stuff that makes so much sense
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:14.160]  i mean it's it's true in fact quite frankly you're even more important than
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:18.080]  i am of the new york times because you're just citizen journalists
[03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.000]  giving your view videotaping what happens asking real questions you see
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.240]  national news all the time from some question
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:27.520]  at a uh meet and greet with a person because media
[03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:32.480]  or media establishment press to media will not ask real questions
[03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:36.160]  okay and then you could even claim you know info wars has an agenda it is
[03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:39.280]  libertarian patriot ideals we tell the truth but you still say there's an
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:41.440]  agenda because you know we got to pay the bills or whatever
[03:04:41.440 --> 03:04:44.640]  the you know agenda to try to have advertising whatever it just comes to
[03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:48.320]  the territory it's not bad it's just true but a pure person on the street with a
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:51.680]  blog or videotaping something they saw on youtube
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:55.520]  that is veritas right there we can all look at it and come back with our own
[03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:57.600]  view great job to the crew god bless you all
[03:04:57.600 --> 03:05:27.440]  sorry to the college
