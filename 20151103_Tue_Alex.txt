[01:54.720 --> 02:01.920]  borders are the obstacle they're very proud of this Merkel Germany must step up world role
[02:01.920 --> 02:10.040]  climate change causing waves 750 arrive in tiny village of 102 we reported on that a few days
[02:10.040 --> 02:17.400]  ago but now it's in international news thousands in anti-Islam March hold crucifixes Merkel out
[02:17.400 --> 02:27.320]  pressure glow grows to close borders but the head of the UN migrant agency the guy that helped
[02:27.320 --> 02:33.680]  create the EU openly says yes we're getting rid of your sovereignty yes we're conquering you
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.560]  with outside populations that we will put on the dole that we will fund with your tax money
[02:38.560 --> 02:48.520]  who will vote exactly as we say this is 21st century warfare this is 21st century usurpers
[02:48.520 --> 02:55.560]  this is 21st century takeover and that's not rhetoric as I've said over and over again many
[02:55.560 --> 03:00.720]  listeners are starting to notice that what you heard me talk about 20 years ago 10 years ago a year
[03:00.720 --> 03:08.320]  ago my exact nomenclature or my terms for things are now being used well most of them aren't my
[03:08.320 --> 03:15.080]  terms their terms from white papers their terms from globalist publications I'm using their language
[03:15.080 --> 03:22.680]  when I talk about dictatorial technocracies 15 years ago it's because I read it in CFR white
[03:22.680 --> 03:29.880]  papers now they call themselves technocratic dictators and say it's good to be a dictator
[03:29.880 --> 03:37.320]  because the great tyranny is here and they want to just hide it nakedly in plain view let it all
[03:37.320 --> 03:43.760]  hang out and in a big confidence game try to condition the public to accept it so Tony Shaffer
[03:43.760 --> 03:49.000]  Colonel Shaffer is coming on Michael Savage Dr. Corsi David Knight and more today got a bunch
[03:49.000 --> 03:58.280]  of special reports and of course we have the ultramassive news even the Democrats at the Daily
[03:58.280 --> 04:08.400]  Beast realize that Obama is looking with Hillary and the Democrats at starting a civil war in
[04:08.400 --> 04:19.560]  America that's why they branded Obama as this savior who is basically the return of old honest
[04:19.560 --> 04:30.040]  Abe Lincoln Abraham Lincoln and so there's a Daily Beast article Obama and Hillary toying with
[04:30.040 --> 04:36.720]  the Civil War over gun confiscation and then they admit yes we're coming to confiscate your
[04:36.720 --> 04:42.920]  guns but they actually say you're still black helicopter people for thinking we're coming for
[04:42.920 --> 04:49.440]  them you understand that mental schizoid schizophrenic thing they're trying to implant
[04:49.440 --> 04:56.920]  their people everything we said's coming true but we're still cooks for being right see we'll be back

[08:16.360 --> 08:27.400]  welcome ladies and gentlemen to this Tuesday the third day of November 2015 global transmission
[08:27.960 --> 08:33.320]  Dr. Michael Sabbaths joins us in about 20 minutes then of course we are going to be joined by
[08:33.320 --> 08:39.080]  Colonel Anthony Schaefer and then we have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us as well look at the
[08:39.080 --> 08:46.120]  headline of your a tv viewer on there on the big screen drudgereport.com Germany sliding towards
[08:46.120 --> 08:52.680]  civil war and that is in the london independent rt you name it that is what's being announced
[08:52.680 --> 09:00.920]  by government ministers as towns of 102 people are told you will house 700 people and you will pay
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.200]  for everything and as old people and disabled are thrown out of government housing
[09:07.400 --> 09:12.360]  Merkel has to absolutely break the german will and if they can get them to accept this
[09:12.360 --> 09:18.440]  they will accept anything and the problem is germans are smart hardworking people
[09:18.440 --> 09:24.040]  but they tend to follow government orders until they don't and then all hell breaks loose
[09:24.920 --> 09:32.440]  and we are approaching the point at which what's left to the german people a dying race no doubt
[09:32.440 --> 09:39.800]  gets angry so that is coming up germany's dying in germany it's not german bloodlines
[09:39.800 --> 09:46.280]  aren't dying around the world you got places like Omaha that's about all you find but it is amazing
[09:46.280 --> 09:54.760]  to watch the purposeful in the words of the un immigration chief the purposeful destruction of
[09:54.760 --> 10:02.600]  europe by design one in three refugees to us now from africa libya warns it could flood europe already
[10:02.600 --> 10:10.840]  is new york times mass immigration to the west only the opening act germany must do more says
[10:10.840 --> 10:18.680]  merkel the globalists are turning off the food supplies the globalists are deindustrializing
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.240]  the west and destroying the industrialization that they're attempting the third world then they're
[10:23.240 --> 10:35.400]  using giant strip mining streams of illegal immigration just spewing into the west to
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.280]  overturn society and i use that term strip mine because in a classic strip mine you have high
[10:40.280 --> 10:46.440]  powered water at hundreds of times what comes through a fire hose cutting right through rock
[10:46.440 --> 10:51.720]  right through sediment to get the valuable minerals out whether it be gold silver uranium
[10:51.720 --> 10:59.640]  whatever you're mining for and so i'm not against water as i've said many times but water coming
[10:59.640 --> 11:05.240]  out of one of those hoses will cut you in two i'm not against the poor desperate arabs the
[11:05.240 --> 11:11.720]  poor desperate africans the poor desperate latin americans the poor desperate asians but they're
[11:11.720 --> 11:20.840]  fleeing collapsed failed civilizations they are fleeing systems for a reason and the globalists
[11:20.840 --> 11:28.280]  want to bring them here to organize them into the chaos which will then bring in the global
[11:28.280 --> 11:42.120]  totalitarian order but it is focused directed chaos let me get into the news here let me go
[11:42.120 --> 11:49.320]  over these headlines themselves before i get into the situation europe that is a mirror of what is
[11:49.320 --> 11:54.520]  going to be unfolding here they're just a few years ahead of us you can already see the similar
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.800]  situation with the quote migrants the immigrants the children that's all the media focuses on
[11:59.800 --> 12:09.400]  17 percent of them under the age of 18 you can see the pr but now what's happening in europe
[12:09.400 --> 12:20.280]  uh threatens to bring the world economy to its knees which again is part of the larger plan
[12:21.000 --> 12:28.120]  but within all of this deindustrialization within all of this crisis creation that's unfolding
[12:28.680 --> 12:36.360]  is the political agenda to disarm us we have the story linked up on info wars dot com it's from the
[12:36.360 --> 12:46.200]  daily beast there's also a report on it by breitbart and here is the headline daily beast
[12:46.200 --> 12:55.560]  obama hillary is toying with civil war over gun confiscation and within this article you've got
[12:55.560 --> 13:05.080]  the most classic example of doublespeak and mass mind control and true cult programming
[13:05.080 --> 13:11.400]  because they admit and have the quotes of hillary obama and others saying we may have to confiscate
[13:11.400 --> 13:17.720]  that that's now been said in the last month several times we've played the clips they go on to say
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.600]  this is going to scare the delusional black helicopter people you know that's folks that
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.720]  see open military drills for gun confiscation in their towns they take photos they shoot video
[13:29.720 --> 13:35.400]  they make films about it myself and then you get called a kook on the front page of the paper and
[13:35.400 --> 13:40.440]  on the news and they say it doesn't exist or a blimp comes down low over salt lake
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.960]  surveilling everyone and they say that it's a flying saucer no it's a surveillance blimp but
[13:45.960 --> 13:52.040]  but this is the mind control we're coming for your guns but it's not a conspiracy to take your
[13:52.040 --> 13:57.000]  guns it's not oh the conspiracy theorists were right they really weren't conspiracy theorists
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  they saw the slide towards the talitarianism classical totalitarianism with a disarmed population
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.920]  boy they're right we should join them boy the nsa is spying on everybody boy the government is
[14:08.920 --> 14:14.200]  shipping in the narcotics boy they sure have connected these vaccines to cancer and autism
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.640]  and neurological disorders wow the conspiracy theorists were right about gmo and glyphosate
[14:19.640 --> 14:22.920]  wow they were right about world government being announced they were right about the
[14:22.920 --> 14:26.200]  interest rates being rigged they were right about the currencies being rigged they were
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.480]  right about the stock market being rigged they were right about the fellow reserve being private
[14:29.480 --> 14:33.720]  they were right about secret torture prisons they were right about eugenics they were right about
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.920]  fluoride causing brain cancer and bone cancer harvard admits it even the fda and epa say take it
[14:38.920 --> 14:42.680]  out of the water they were right they were right they were right they were right they were dead on
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.200]  they were paul reveres they warned us over and over and over and over and over again
[14:46.200 --> 14:50.600]  they were the real liberals they were the true freedom lovers oh my gosh political correctness
[14:50.600 --> 14:55.240]  is banning free speech. Oh my gosh, it is the Talitarianism. Oh my gosh, what have we become?
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.960]  On and on. Oh my gosh, the ice sheets are getting bigger. Oh my gosh, the earth is cooling.
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.520]  Oh my gosh, it's not human unless it's the secret geoengineering they now admits going on.
[15:10.040 --> 15:15.640]  There's a whole world going on that Bill Maher and Rachel Maddow aren't covering and aren't going
[15:15.640 --> 15:23.400]  to tell you about. And that Fox News isn't going to tell you about. Fox News still gets up there
[15:23.400 --> 15:28.520]  routinely and will just put my face up and just have some random report about women being raped
[15:28.520 --> 15:37.240]  or thieves or internet hate and they'll just cut to a clip of me. I'm not involved in raping women.
[15:37.240 --> 15:44.040]  I'm not involved in Boston bombings, but they pray on you like you're lazy in a trance. Well,
[15:44.040 --> 15:50.760]  you're not in a trance, are you? And so here it is, Daily Beast, Obama, Hillary toying with Civil
[15:50.760 --> 15:57.640]  War over gun confiscation. On November 2nd, the Daily Beast pointed to recent statements from
[15:57.640 --> 16:01.560]  President Obama and Hillary Clinton regarding the implementation of Australian-style gun
[16:01.560 --> 16:07.480]  confiscation and suggested, quote, civil war could erupt on American soil. Well, what did I tell that
[16:07.480 --> 16:12.680]  Redcoat creature? I said, listen, I don't care how many brainwashed lemons you got. We won't relinquish
[16:12.680 --> 16:18.920]  our guns. 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. You're on notice.
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.120]  They went on to say civil war could erupt on American soil if any administration actually
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.960]  tried to confiscate privately owned firearms. Well, that's not true. They're doing it by
[16:29.960 --> 16:36.840]  covert semi-stealth in New York, Rhode Island, Illinois, California and a bunch of other states
[16:36.840 --> 16:40.280]  where they're implementing federally, but they do it in states they think have got a population
[16:40.280 --> 16:46.840]  that won't stand up. We're Bloomberg at the headline two years ago. Gun confiscation begins in California
[16:49.560 --> 16:53.960]  and they show up and go, yeah, you got a prescription for Prozac 15 years ago. You said you were
[16:53.960 --> 16:59.000]  depressed. You got diagnosed with depression. Your guns are gone. Boom. Hey, the VA has an
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.880]  algorithm. You don't have any criminal record. You haven't been adjudicated, unfit, but we're going to
[17:03.880 --> 17:11.640]  take your gun. You haven't been adjudicated to be incompetent. Folks, you can't get a schizophrenic
[17:11.640 --> 17:16.360]  person that isn't hurting people adjudicated incompetent. Believe me, I know people that
[17:16.360 --> 17:20.200]  have family members that have schizophrenic family members who are allowed to think space
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.440]  aliens are coming after them and who think the sun is following them. I know one guy who thinks
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.920]  the sun is following him around. He comes up and shows me photos when he sees me in public.
[17:28.920 --> 17:32.920]  He's a nice guy and says, look, it's following me. See, it's following me now. And I'm like,
[17:32.920 --> 17:37.240]  no, it's the sun. It's just your perspective. It's so big. It looks like it's following.
[17:39.720 --> 17:43.320]  You can't get them adjudicated incompetent because they're not hurting anybody.
[17:44.200 --> 17:49.240]  But that's under law. But outside of that, they just say, oh, VA is just going to say you can't
[17:49.240 --> 17:59.480]  have guns. And now they're going to apply that same quote algorithm pre-crime to every social
[17:59.480 --> 18:05.160]  security recipient 64 and up. How you like them apples. That's in the Washington post.
[18:05.160 --> 18:10.360]  That's not Alex Jones saying it. What are you going to do as it all comes true? See, I don't
[18:10.360 --> 18:15.400]  want it to come true. I don't want to be a big international sensation when everything I say
[18:15.400 --> 18:22.120]  ends up happening. I want to stop these people and still let the dumb idiots out there think it
[18:22.120 --> 18:27.080]  wasn't true. So I don't get proven right. But you know what? It's going to get proven right.
[18:27.080 --> 18:31.720]  You stupid slobs out there that think you're liberal and follow the Huffington post and
[18:31.720 --> 18:38.120]  Daily Beast. Do you understand what eugenics is, jackasses? Do you understand they put
[18:38.120 --> 18:43.480]  cancer viruses on record in the vaccines to soft kill your stupid little butt?
[18:45.080 --> 18:50.520]  I want to slap these people upside the head. Do you understand they're probably going to
[18:50.520 --> 18:54.680]  blow up federal buildings and blame it on libertarians and start a civil war?
[18:54.680 --> 18:59.000]  Do you know what that's going to do to the economy and your little lazy world? You know what's
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  going to do to you? And by the way, if this thing goes hot, all of you that have been going along
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.840]  with this, you are going to be open season. You know that. I'm not threatening anybody.
[19:11.480 --> 19:15.400]  You know how many people are sick of this that are real men out there that have been controlling
[19:15.400 --> 19:20.520]  themselves? They are sick of you. They will not be conquered by you and they are just waiting,
[19:20.520 --> 19:27.400]  trying to fix this peacefully. Let's go back. On November 2nd, the Daily Beast pointed to
[19:27.400 --> 19:33.000]  recent statements from President Obama and Hillary Clinton regarding the implementation of Australian
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.800]  style gun confiscation and suggested civil war, this is a quote, could erupt on American soil
[19:39.800 --> 19:44.760]  if any administration actually tried to confiscate privately on firearms. The Daily Beast theoretically
[19:44.760 --> 19:49.880]  agreed that confiscation on a massive scale may be needed and quote the only way to solve American
[19:49.880 --> 19:54.840]  gun violence, that's a quote, confiscate the guns. But they pointed out that it was not realistic
[19:54.840 --> 20:00.840]  and suggested Hillary risk causing irreparable divisions. My name is Bill Bonner and I have an
[20:00.840 --> 20:06.920]  important message. Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable
[20:06.920 --> 20:13.240]  crisis, but they're about to lose control. When this happens, it will rip our country apart
[20:13.240 --> 20:19.240]  in ways you never imagined, from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want
[20:19.240 --> 20:24.520]  to protect. Look, I've made predictions like this before. A few years ago, I warned that the housing
[20:24.520 --> 20:30.600]  prices would collapse. Before that, I warned that dot com companies would crash and they did.
[20:30.600 --> 20:36.280]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves, but this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[20:36.280 --> 20:44.040]  This will affect us all. I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com. Maybe you'll disagree with
[20:44.040 --> 20:49.960]  my conclusions, but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself. You can watch

[23:55.960 --> 24:05.160]  Come and take it.
[24:05.160 --> 24:09.960]  I heard from friends of stuff a few weeks ago that the hit movie Sicario that means hitman
[24:09.960 --> 24:15.640]  in Spanish comes from a derivation of the word zealot for those that fought the Roman Empire
[24:15.640 --> 24:21.720]  and of course got destroyed by Titus in 70 AD but that's a little side issue. I finally a few
[24:21.720 --> 24:31.640]  days ago got a chance to see it and I personally think the film that gets an 8.0 on IMDB deserves
[24:31.640 --> 24:39.080]  it. It's very well done. A lot of it's extremely accurate where it shows the US military operating
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.640]  in Mexico and taking out cartel leaders and people and it shows how the CIA is operating
[24:43.640 --> 24:48.920]  domestically and then they just admit at the end of the movie spoiler alert that
[24:50.360 --> 24:56.920]  they're orchestrating civil war in Mexico so that they can take out all the cartels and only
[24:56.920 --> 25:05.160]  put one cartel in charge and it's got people's children being killed which is something even
[25:05.160 --> 25:10.440]  the cartels won't do so there's Hollywood trying to sell going to the next level where the good
[25:10.440 --> 25:18.680]  CIA kills a man's wife and his two young sons because it's vengeance and it makes the Delta
[25:18.680 --> 25:25.160]  Force look invincible yeah that's the sucker people into that it's all just mind control
[25:25.160 --> 25:32.520]  but people like wow it tells the truth yeah it normalizes it and it's got the star actor of the
[25:32.520 --> 25:43.240]  CIA commando Josh Brolin teaching people that the end justifies the means which is what they teach
[25:43.240 --> 25:47.960]  you in the Delta Force graduation they've had to change it because it's leaked that that was one
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.600]  of the trick questions you read Machiavelli's The Prince and then if you agree with doing
[25:52.600 --> 25:58.440]  evil things to defeat evil then you get to graduate because you're immoral and look
[25:58.440 --> 26:05.160]  the truth is sometimes if you're in a war for your life you do end up doing really nasty stuff
[26:05.160 --> 26:12.920]  to survive but this is an empire doing nasty stuff to expand evil if they wouldn't have made
[26:12.920 --> 26:18.680]  narcotics illegal in the 1930s because they wanted something new to bootleg and sell when when
[26:18.680 --> 26:26.760]  when alcohol was made legal after prohibition Mexico would be a thriving prosperous country
[26:26.760 --> 26:35.560]  right now almost all sociologists agree professors economists we've had them all in on from across
[26:35.560 --> 26:42.600]  this board the drug war has destroyed many countries in Latin America and it's going to destroy America
[26:44.600 --> 26:52.680]  and 100 there is a war in Colombia Nicaragua El Salvador Guatemala Mexico and even further south
[26:52.680 --> 27:04.200]  and different corporations and federal agencies own huge multi-million acre branches in those
[27:04.200 --> 27:10.440]  countries and they grow the cocaine they grow the opium they grow the marijuana they grow it all
[27:10.440 --> 27:15.960]  and they don't want it legalized or decriminalized because they want to run that stuff in here
[27:15.960 --> 27:24.040]  then they can corrupt the local police departments they can pay everybody off they can create new
[27:24.040 --> 27:29.080]  cartels that don't even know they're controlled by the western governments it's like Larry Nichols
[27:29.080 --> 27:33.640]  talks about he was one of the top guys in the Dixie mafia in Arkansas he had learned till years
[27:33.640 --> 27:37.720]  later that people in the state government and the wealthiest people in the state were actually
[27:37.720 --> 27:48.040]  the heads of it all over the country all all over the south that's right the real mafia is wasp
[27:48.680 --> 27:55.320]  and Jews and people like that I mean the German mafia just went legit by the 20s the Irish mafia
[27:55.320 --> 27:59.640]  went legit by the 30s the Jewish mafia just went legit they took over the government
[28:02.040 --> 28:06.280]  and they all just merged their powers into corporate boardrooms and the Italians wouldn't
[28:06.280 --> 28:11.320]  really join it and said this is our thing and we're competitive with us so they said you know what
[28:11.320 --> 28:17.560]  we control Hollywood all gangsters are Italian now how you like that here's the FBI bye bye
[28:17.560 --> 28:22.040]  you want to meet the real mafia oh and by the way Italian mafia you want to mess with us we're
[28:22.040 --> 28:27.080]  going to send in us army commandos to kill you and your families you think you're tough
[28:30.040 --> 28:35.400]  they've got probably 30 brigades of sheet-depth troops in the country from my estimation
[28:35.400 --> 28:37.400]  30 brigades
[28:40.680 --> 28:46.680]  hundreds of thousands of just murderers just in every town every city ready to get activated
[28:46.680 --> 28:52.200]  and go kill whoever they're called this government is a criminal filthy operation and you know why
[28:52.200 --> 28:56.840]  I'm against it because it's wrecking society in the whole world and people think it's tough
[28:56.840 --> 29:02.680]  and it's cool no you don't produce anything you bring in addictive substances you jack up the
[29:02.680 --> 29:07.000]  prizes you put people in prisons who are dumb enough to use them and then all the crime that's
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.440]  associated around it and then you greedily sell pharmaceutical drugs on top of it and the reason
[29:12.440 --> 29:21.480]  I raised that is because they're openly saying a civil war is going to break out and that they're
[29:21.480 --> 29:25.240]  going to come try to take the guns and this is where this all ends just like they started a civil
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.280]  war in Mexico and we'll all just kill each other while the social engineers sit back and laugh at
[29:30.280 --> 29:37.080]  everyone and now these black ops squads and corporate squads are snuff films and child trafficking
[29:37.080 --> 29:41.880]  and white slavery and the argument is in like brazinski's book the technotronic era back in
[29:41.880 --> 29:46.360]  the 70s is well that's how we control it but we've seen what's happened under your control
[29:46.360 --> 29:54.680]  it's gone to seed you you push this stuff you're sick on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:17.160 --> 33:22.680]  you know i respect michael savage and when i would listen to him 10 12 years ago i agree with
[33:22.680 --> 33:29.720]  about 95 but what he would say there's a socialist plan to flood the west with radical islamics
[33:29.720 --> 33:33.800]  and to create caliphates and takeover he was the first person i ever heard say that i thought
[33:34.520 --> 33:40.200]  well i believe him he sounds sincere and i could tell he's a man who believes in what he's doing
[33:40.200 --> 33:45.880]  and he's a smart guy with all these letters to his name but man that's really crazy would the
[33:45.880 --> 33:51.640]  elite really do that and now here's the headline migrant crisis pushing germany towards anarchy
[33:51.640 --> 33:58.360]  and civil war in one town alone the daily mail reports 750 military age men basically
[33:58.920 --> 34:04.120]  in a town of 102 they're demanding the germans pay for it all same things happening here with
[34:04.120 --> 34:09.800]  the open borders who talked about language borders culture michael savage so call him a
[34:09.800 --> 34:15.800]  prophet a historian a man before his time uh he is a renaissance man of course best-selling
[34:15.800 --> 34:21.800]  author launch much of the modern herbal uh supplement movement we know of in the 60s and 70s
[34:21.800 --> 34:27.240]  if there's one guy you could say michael savage under another known diplom and now he's with us
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.440]  for just 30 minutes i'm gonna shut up and go to him but i gotta tell you he's banned from entering
[34:32.440 --> 34:37.640]  england i've been threatened that i'll be banned from entering europe or england now if i criticize
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.360]  radical islam they are arresting germans in mass and taking their kids from them if they
[34:42.360 --> 34:47.800]  criticize radical islam the women are being told don't wear short skirts they're canceling christian
[34:47.800 --> 34:54.680]  holidays in public squares because the radical islamics uh are offended this is the suicide of
[34:54.680 --> 34:58.760]  the west you talk about total mental illness because i mean these radical islamics are
[34:58.760 --> 35:02.440]  going to go after the liberals first thing when they get control it is suicidal it's a form of
[35:02.440 --> 35:07.880]  cuckolding in my view he's got his new book out the last one was censored on china getting ready
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.840]  to make big moves you notice that all happened china is now involved with clandestine radio they
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.640]  secretly own in the u.s trying to censor media they block hollywood movies being released
[35:18.600 --> 35:24.120]  his new book government zero no borders no language no culture and folks you may all get it
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.200]  but your friends and family don't this is a book you better give them this christmas or
[35:28.200 --> 35:34.520]  this holiday season and i'm here pushing it because savage needs support with his information he
[35:34.520 --> 35:39.080]  doesn't need money he needs to get the book out and you need to get the book out and you
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.160]  need to support people that are telling the truth now i'm done ranting i want to come back to the
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.640]  next month for a full hour he's doing a book tour right now as we just got 25 minutes with us but
[35:48.200 --> 35:54.120]  to say it's dire when the daily beast says we need to confiscate guns that's a quote but the black
[35:54.120 --> 35:59.000]  helicopter people may fight back so we're still crazy even though we were right they're coming
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.360]  for the guns and we were right they're going to get rid of the borders and we were right they're
[36:02.360 --> 36:06.520]  coming with forced inoculation and we were right about world government with the pope calling for
[36:06.520 --> 36:11.880]  it michael savage i'm gonna try to shut up but i tell you this is an epic moment you've laid so
[36:11.880 --> 36:18.920]  much knowledge on us where are we now where are we going word is you're being censored as well
[36:18.920 --> 36:23.720]  they're trying to block your new book i mean it is on they're saying they want to persecute the press
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.400]  supreme court justice told matt drudge that they're coming next year to shut down basically talk
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.480]  radio and free speech on the internet i mean it's here what do we do michael savage okay
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.120]  without hammering the book i want to start with the title because it says it all government zero
[36:40.760 --> 36:44.760]  if we don't see president zero invoking government zero i'd like to know what it's
[36:44.760 --> 36:51.480]  going to take but the average moron out there idiot moron fools who have sold the country away
[36:51.480 --> 36:55.960]  running around in shorts with halloween costumes with their children on drugs and sugar and they
[36:55.960 --> 37:04.840]  wonder why these sobs with that monster tyrant leftist bastard in the white house this guy is the
[37:04.840 --> 37:13.480]  smartest leftist in the history of the world this slick bs artist barry from hana lulu has done more
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.920]  harm to the world than marx and letin put together and he gets away with it for one reason alex
[37:18.920 --> 37:25.640]  he doesn't shout like me have you ever heard barry from hana lulu scream no never he is the
[37:25.640 --> 37:33.640]  smoothest con man in the history of the world he makes soros look like a chump soros by the way
[37:33.640 --> 37:39.080]  is behind breaking all the borders of europe you know that with his open society you know
[37:39.080 --> 37:43.800]  soros is who flooded america with marijuana you know that now many people like marijuana i think
[37:43.800 --> 37:51.080]  it's one of the most toxic substances in the world it is the road to addiction it is a gateway drug
[37:51.080 --> 37:57.720]  who has made it suddenly so friendly ten years ago i fought with one of soros's minions on my radio
[37:57.720 --> 38:04.440]  show soros was the first to fund medical marijuana initiatives in arizona and california and i was
[38:04.440 --> 38:09.960]  arguing are you people crazy it's a gateway drug you're going to hook a generation on drugs we had
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.160]  this argument it's history now marijuana is as friendly as candy corn everyone thinks it's a
[38:15.160 --> 38:21.320]  benign herb it is not so what does it have to do with soros's master plan the man is possibly the
[38:21.320 --> 38:26.920]  most evil genius on the planet in my estimation why does he want to break the borders of every
[38:26.920 --> 38:34.600]  nation on earth what is it that they're after what do you mean no borders well listen no borders no
[38:34.600 --> 38:41.160]  language no culture a mass of stupid drug humanity easily manipulated turned into slaves
[38:41.160 --> 38:46.680]  serfs in their own country what more do you need to know children on drugs parents on alcohol
[38:46.680 --> 38:53.240]  marijuana and drugs and then you have the puppet masters as in the godfather the peasant avante
[38:53.240 --> 38:58.680]  is pulling the strings sucking the money out of the people's pockets as they go to work like slaves
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.880]  in their little slave factories thinking they're free remember orwell's book remember that great
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.680]  phrase those who rattle their chains most loudly loudly scream i'm free i'm free i'm free yes that's

[41:25.480 --> 41:33.080]  even touch god guns and gays remember that that time not so long ago but barry from hanelulu
[41:33.080 --> 41:39.720]  is such a slick con artist that he's so hoodwinked the american drug addict that they actually think

[43:02.760 --> 43:10.040]  supported him why does polosi push it because that is all roads lead to roam you ever hear that one
[43:10.040 --> 43:15.480]  going back every time all roads lead to roam that's as far as i can go without winding up with
[43:15.480 --> 43:22.520]  lead shoes in the bottom of san francisco bay and i'll let it hang in the air it is the most corrupt
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.840]  degenerate criminal government in american history and i'm not saying this for a fact
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.560]  nor to sell a book i'm trying to awaken people unfortunately alec your audience is already
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.840]  awakened they're agitated they're ready to strike they don't know what to do but look at the morons
[43:36.840 --> 43:40.840]  around you go walk in the street they're zombie walk in san francisco yesterday the most beautiful
[43:40.840 --> 43:47.240]  city i love it to death and walking through a park near the embarked arrow and without being graphic
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.480]  i'm an old boy scout so i read footprints in the woods and i can read droppings in the woods i was
[43:53.480 --> 43:58.760]  taught how to follow droppings of what kind of animal it is well there was a dropping on the
[43:58.760 --> 44:03.720]  ground on the sidewalk that i said there are no bears in the city how could the artist can't be
[44:03.720 --> 44:09.080]  a bear well it's an admitted record problem in san francisco public defecation and now in government
[44:09.080 --> 44:14.600]  buildings even when they have bathrooms they're so mentally ill that they just enjoy crapping in
[44:14.600 --> 44:20.600]  public what does that say about a civilization alex that people are allowed to crap without being
[44:20.600 --> 44:25.880]  they're having their heads broken open by a cop in my day if a guy did that a big irish cop would
[44:25.880 --> 44:30.360]  smash him on the head with a night stick and drag him into the into the into the prison
[44:30.360 --> 44:35.480]  and hose him down and throw him into a jail and leave him there well what kind of country is this
[44:35.480 --> 44:41.480]  that permits this to go on now you ask yourself if society is breaking down and at the same time
[44:41.480 --> 44:46.920]  they're trying to break us down what is it all about so the public defecation could be stopped in
[44:46.920 --> 44:53.720]  one second right so what is this about it's the constantly lower the standards of the middle class
[44:53.720 --> 45:00.200]  constantly dehumanize the middle class that's it right dehumanize desensitize
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.440]  weaken weaken weaken weaken until eventually they have no resistance to whatever the evil
[45:06.440 --> 45:13.960]  criminal gangsters in their in the regime might do next it's as simple as that alex and at one
[45:13.960 --> 45:19.720]  at the want and at the uh the wish to not offend people who think i'm peddling a book i have to

[46:24.760 --> 46:29.160]  oh it's admittedly if you wanted what people are reporting that they're going in stores
[46:29.720 --> 46:36.120]  and they're finding stacks of the books with the covers bent wow so you got sabotage then they're
[46:36.120 --> 46:40.520]  finding the book in the back not on the front table which the publisher paid for but in the back
[46:40.520 --> 46:45.160]  on the feminine hygiene that's a joke but that's where they're putting it anywhere but where you
[46:45.160 --> 46:51.320]  can find it now which books are selling well why oh riley's books the killing series what what
[46:51.320 --> 46:56.120]  people buying that garbage for what's the revelation about killing patent or killing reagan can you

[46:59.640 --> 47:03.960]  don't already know it's mindless it's non-threatening they want to think they're pseudo intellectuals
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.560]  they want to sit back and read something that's utterly mindless well i i said this facetiously
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.560]  i certainly don't mean it but i said i'm waiting for the next book in the series by him called
[47:13.560 --> 47:19.080]  killing a riley maybe you do us all a favor and end it already he's got some franchise going there
[47:19.080 --> 47:22.840]  doesn't he but nevertheless let's get back to serious stuff no borders no language no culture
[47:22.840 --> 47:28.040]  what does that matter left this is hey savage what the heck you're so excited about what do you need
[47:28.040 --> 47:34.840]  a border for and what are you holding on to english for your parents were immigrants weren't they
[47:34.840 --> 47:40.200]  michael yes and and so what's your point larry i was a larry king last week he has a little show
[47:40.200 --> 47:45.320]  on russian television how is that for funny come up come about of events but i actually like larry
[47:45.320 --> 47:52.280]  king you know why alex he's a liberal old school nice liberal smart but not vicious totally different
[47:52.280 --> 47:58.520]  than the new generation of progressive psychos right he says to me your parents were immigrants
[47:58.520 --> 48:02.600]  so what are you afraid of someone not speaking english i said i don't care what language they
[48:02.600 --> 48:07.320]  speak at home my grandmother never spoke a word of english but my father drilled into me
[48:07.320 --> 48:13.080]  you're in america learn english learn the best way you can become an american you're not living
[48:13.080 --> 48:18.680]  anywhere else be an american and that's not the ethos of this generation is it do you hear them
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.600]  teaching their children learn english they're teaching them learn anything but english stamp on
[48:22.600 --> 48:27.640]  the country that's so good to you don't learn their language there is no culture there how long
[48:27.640 --> 48:32.520]  is the left taught us that america has no culture it's an aculturated nation that we're a nation with
[48:32.520 --> 48:38.040]  no culture they want to get rid of our culture so they can then download into us their sick mentally
[48:38.040 --> 48:43.080]  ill culture and you were one of the first to say this but more and more it's clear the top liberals
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.680]  are vicious mafia social engineers as you've documented but their minions really are mentally
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.560]  ill basket cases i'm sure you saw the atlantic monthly article a few weeks ago about the coddle
[48:53.560 --> 48:58.920]  generation admitting and these are left as saying that their college students have now become like
[48:58.920 --> 49:05.640]  these weird malice youth brigades that shout them down for just any language they are complete
[49:06.360 --> 49:12.040]  but the fascist basket cases that just flip out and now want to ban the word mother and father
[49:13.240 --> 49:17.640]  you're a father alec you know that children need discipline you know what happens when you raise
[49:17.640 --> 49:21.960]  them without discipline they become animals animals i was in a chinese restaurant last night
[49:23.400 --> 49:28.120]  in san francisco i love a dumpy restaurant that i go to there was a kid two of them running around
[49:28.120 --> 49:33.240]  screaming at the top of the lungs i mean screeching where the the food you couldn't even digest it i
[49:33.240 --> 49:38.120]  wasn't going to say anything because you know what are you going to do i looked at the father
[49:38.120 --> 49:44.760]  he was a nice looking guy not a weakling but indulgent afraid to say no to johnny the type
[49:44.760 --> 49:50.200]  that when johnny defecates in his hand and wipes it on the wall he will say johnny is an artist
[49:50.200 --> 49:55.720]  that's a shagali just painted don't wipe it off the wall these people these people are crazy
[49:55.720 --> 50:03.160]  they are no they have no discipline themselves remember if the father's 30 32 33 right he may
[50:03.160 --> 50:07.720]  look good he may be what's amazing to me is that these guys are well built they all go to the gym
[50:07.720 --> 50:13.320]  right alex they all got abs but they have no no cerebrum they don't have the minds of men
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.600]  well they have abs they have good abs but no no no cerebrum fold no folds in the brain
[50:18.600 --> 50:24.440]  that folds in the stomach he's like zomboids walking around wild crazy children this child's
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.920]  made to be only one thing which is a tort lawyer that's all they grew up to be and if he fails at
[50:28.920 --> 50:35.000]  that it can become a government worker but aside from the facetiousness okay discipline gone society
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.640]  going breaking down at the top gangster regime sucking us dry paul ryan first speech first
[50:41.640 --> 50:46.120]  speech first speech highway bill highway bill highway bill who's in the highway building business
[50:46.840 --> 50:51.480]  who makes the trillions off the highway bill are you in the highway business you don't know but
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.360]  nancy polosi went into congress worth about a half a million now she's worth hundreds of millions
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.640]  and her husband suddenly became worth billions she's a nice lady of course i'm sure she's friends
[51:01.640 --> 51:07.080]  with don curlier and i she's a sweet grandmother and you know what's also nice about polosi is the
[51:07.080 --> 51:12.920]  fact that her brother-in-law got about a $1.2 billion loan from the government for a solar
[51:12.920 --> 51:18.680]  solar plant in the nevada desert and he did so well in producing about a megawatt of energy for it
[51:18.680 --> 51:22.680]  that they gave him another 800 million according to what i've recently read how come it's not in any
[51:22.680 --> 51:27.400]  of the newspapers have you ever seen corruption like this couldn't even go on yeah what's wrong
[51:27.400 --> 51:32.600]  with harry reid giving billions in contracts to his sons he's got like four or five of them
[51:32.600 --> 51:37.080]  what's that that's nothing that shouldn't even be in the news i mean how dare you do your research
[51:37.080 --> 51:42.200]  it's totally normal republican party there is none it's a one party system oligarchy all the
[51:42.200 --> 51:47.480]  conservators that were put in last year were put at the back of the bus remember how much hope we had
[51:47.480 --> 51:51.800]  in november when i wrote stop the coming civil war i said hold your nose go vote for republicans
[51:51.800 --> 51:57.400]  and we'll put their feet to the fire after they win guess what baner has no feet mcconnell has no
[51:57.400 --> 52:03.880]  feet there's no feet to put on the fire they're empty shells they were never men they were never
[52:03.880 --> 52:10.600]  there they were factotums of barry from honolulu one party period it is a fascist dictatorship
[52:10.600 --> 52:16.200]  he wants to crush us under his fist he is the worst monster in the history of america and if he uses
[52:16.200 --> 52:20.520]  an executive order to go around congress on immigration we need 10 million people demanding
[52:20.520 --> 52:25.240]  immediately demanding that an impeachment hearing be started whether or not those cowardly useless
[52:25.240 --> 52:29.960]  gangster republicans do it or not we need a people's tribunal now let's be positive for a moment
[52:29.960 --> 52:35.960]  i agree we need a people's tribunal and find these people guilty of war crimes i agree but but your
[52:35.960 --> 52:41.560]  audience my audience drudge and world net daling a lot of the great people uh did get organized we
[52:41.560 --> 52:49.560]  did get 40 or so a libertarian constitutionalist they did get rid of ryan of uh of of boner then
[52:49.560 --> 52:54.040]  of course they brought in ryan but the point is we get a whole another group in they won't be able
[52:54.040 --> 53:00.920]  to suppress 80 to 100 so we are marching forward we are getting closer uh but i expect they're
[53:00.920 --> 53:05.320]  going to pull out all the stops now to try to shut down our free speech which they've said they'll
[53:05.320 --> 53:10.040]  do to stop us resting control you said yourself 10 minutes ago there's going to be a revolution
[53:10.040 --> 53:14.600]  in this country i hope it's peaceful so specifically michael savage joining us right now michael

[53:32.440 --> 53:38.200]  because i'm a scholar by training book the end of the book i have 40 action points direct
[53:38.200 --> 53:44.920]  actions that have to be taken immediately to save the nation the number one thing is
[53:44.920 --> 53:49.560]  create a nationalist party now you may say that's crazy that has no chance of winning
[53:49.560 --> 53:56.520]  not now alex alex we have to start laying the groundwork to save the country by by creating
[53:56.520 --> 54:03.640]  a new party the nationalist party you know there's a a a a word going around liberal parents be where
[54:03.640 --> 54:07.800]  the millennials are very conservative do you know that yes you know that it's a conservative
[54:07.800 --> 54:13.160]  generation that's rebelling against the insane drug addicted liberal parents yes if we had a
[54:13.160 --> 54:17.960]  charismatic young leader if i were 40 right now and knew what i know now and had the the the
[54:17.960 --> 54:21.960]  reach i have now i'd run i wouldn't run for office excuse me it's corrupt i'd create the
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.120]  nationalist party knowing that in 10 years we'd run we'd win and win in this country
[54:27.480 --> 54:33.480]  so i'm not gonna do it i'm not young enough to create a party nationalist party to close
[54:33.480 --> 54:39.960]  the borders for seven years i didn't say anything but close the borders for seven years absorb all
[54:39.960 --> 54:46.760]  those who are here number three deport all illegal aliens dot dot dot in prison see people misquote
[54:46.760 --> 54:53.400]  me i said first start by deporting the criminal illegal aliens in prison alex one third of all
[54:53.400 --> 54:58.600]  our prisoners as i point out as you well know one third of our prisoners are illegal aliens what
[54:58.600 --> 55:04.600]  are we paying them for get them out of the country empty the prisons of one third of the prisoners

[56:48.360 --> 56:53.000]  what this Barry from honolulu doesn't know is that if we had a strong leader take over
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.840]  and i pray to god trump wins i know you may i don't know what you think of him
[56:56.840 --> 57:00.040]  he's our only hope right now i think it's a lot better than hillary and i agree with what he has
[57:00.040 --> 57:03.800]  to say and i hope it's the real i'm supporting he uses executive orders and he gets rid of all
[57:03.800 --> 57:08.920]  of these appointees throws him out and says go sue me i'm the government go to hell get out

[58:02.840 --> 58:09.400]  i didn't think of it thank you for your insight i meant government zero means not a government
[58:09.400 --> 58:13.800]  of the people by the people and for the people but a government of itself by itself and for itself
[58:14.840 --> 58:19.480]  we have zero government we have a lawless criminal group exactly zero representation

[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.520]  it's better than what the slavery you had a year before because you could argue some of those regimes
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.720]  you know about two thousand years ago three thousand years ago well two thousand two hundred
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:13.560]  years ago as the real roman empire started up were worse than the romans it's not like loving
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.880]  space aliens have showed up that want to give us free energy it's like aliens have showed up that
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.000]  want to harvest our organs or something and i'm not saying the globals are aliens it's an analogy
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  they don't have our best interest at heart they have disdain for the public they live on these
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.920]  giant beautiful resort community areas on thousands of acres of peace people like pelosi and others
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.920]  and then they're at war with free market rich people because i know i've been in these communities
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.760]  i know a lot of rich people i've been invited to some very interesting places and and they'll be
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.640]  like helicopter pads across the way and they'll say yeah that guy's the ceo of this you know he hates
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.920]  my guts and and this guy over here over here is okay but he's leaving the country and and that lady
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.760]  over there i'm kind of working on her but you know she's just ignorant she got ignorant people
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.400]  that are ultra rich you got really hard working folks that made their money themselves or took
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.800]  some family money and made it even bigger they're almost always free market they believe in people
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.920]  they believe in humanity they like getting down on the trenches that they're not disgusted by the
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:22.520]  masters of people but you get around a globalist gangster they are the most neurotic weirdos their
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:30.440]  staff won't look them in the eyes they're totally hateful they're super cold they're always into
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:39.960]  beating people sexually that's what the elites are into is hurting people that's their sexual fetish
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.440]  i don't mean like some light spanking or something i mean really brutal stuff
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.160]  and and they're into being brutalized they like hurting good things
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:57.000]  it's paedophilia is rampant in the elites just just just rampant and you see that in sociology
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.080]  it comes out but it's it's much worse than the statistic show it is i i know so many people
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:10.280]  that also know really rich people some of the biggest names in america and i'll say at dinner
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:17.400]  i'll say tell me uh what are they into sexually and i'll say what are they into religiously
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.720]  and always out of the person's mouth is satanism the occult
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.560]  i mean these are really unhappy people and that's all they've got to the darkness and i don't mean
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.000]  some guy that goes to a rock and roll show and wears a pentagram t-shirt because he thinks the
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.520]  devil's cool i mean people with helicopters and in in 15 jets and 20 mansions and you know had
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.800]  mistresses when they were 15 years old and and now have you know just sex operatives all over the
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:55.560]  place i mean these folks are completely jacked and they know talent when they see it too they
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:04.680]  know resistance when they see it and i told people this 18 years ago and i've told people this
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:11.800]  over time and now folks can see that it was true a lot of us come out in the news but
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:19.160]  i personally was offered you know to join the new world order repeatedly off record and people
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.160]  said well just tell us who well then if i do that i've lost the confidence i don't even if it's a
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.400]  bad person if they're not telling me something illegal and it's in confidence i don't ever tell
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:35.240]  them i don't ever tell i don't tell my wife about it plus it's dangerous dangerous type stuff but
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.520]  this morning i was on the elliptical and i really had a big epiphany i was watching some show
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:46.200]  called bling on vh1 they had it on i wasn't watching it and it was just flashing this purse this car
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.240]  this this thing for the masses to watch it was just the most soul-sucking garbage and it's like
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:58.760]  who would sell out for that to hang around with a bunch of those mummies a 17-year-old high school
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:04.120]  student in illinois was sent home last week after administrators claimed his hunting t-shirt
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:09.480]  violated the school's dress code policy clinton boyer who wore the rifle-clad sweatshirt feet
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:15.800]  shirt featuring the phrase i'll stop hunting when they pry the gun from my cold dead hands was sent
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.680]  to the principal's office after a teacher took offense to the imagery they told me if i don't
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:26.280]  take the sweater off or turn it inside out i would be sent home the junior said to salk valley news
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:31.160]  clinton who refused to remove the sweatshirt argued that the school's dress code handbook
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:37.400]  included no mention of clothing featuring images of firearms upon inspection of the student handbook
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.960]  clinton's father derrick noted that students were only barred from wearing clothing with
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:48.440]  violence lewd obscene offensive or vulgar images or language and elsewhere in the country we've
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:55.400]  seen students barred from wearing american flag t-shirts you can find more reports on info wars

[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:35.400]  well i could not think of a better guest to have on to give us more
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.440]  information about the vengazi hearings and about the current situation that he predicted
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:50.120]  back when vengazi happened now unfolding in syria and that's because he ran operation stratus
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.320]  ivy able danger and other secret operations against al-qaeda and the wahabi is in afghanistan
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:09:00.840]  and other countries and he was ordered not once but twice to not pull the trigger to kill bin laden
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:08.200]  when they knew exactly where he was in 2001 before 9 11 we just of course had michael sabbage on the
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.600]  last hour about jerome course he's coming up the next hour colonel schaefer joins us for the next
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:20.680]  20 minutes londoncenter dot org is one of the consultancies he is engaged in he of course blew
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.920]  the whistle about some of the stand downs going after bin laden they tried to persecute him as a
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.240]  whistleblower but he survived that thanks for support he's also a best-selling author and has
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:35.720]  a new book out we'll tell you about as well but before we do that i've just got to say well
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:42.280]  colonel schaefer uh it's it's got to be good for you being one of the first people to expose what
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.840]  was happening in bin gazi and i know taking a lot of heat to now see more and more of it come out
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:52.520]  has that taken some of the heat off you why yes i know alex i mean i think uh you and others
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.000]  supported me on this from day one thank you uh with that said it's been a very impotent
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.840]  or position even now because you know at the heart of this is really hillary clinton who is the
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:09.640]  chosen one for the democrat uh candidacy for president so as much as i think rational people
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.120]  uh and by the way i've been getting questions from the left so my friends on the left saying hey
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.160]  do you really think this is all true it's like yeah it's all true and uh i think the hearings
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.160]  should have if it was a democrat uh congress questioning a republican candidate who had
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.760]  been a lover for that candidate but instead the very email alex which they have completely
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:36.680]  chose it show that she she this plan was lying and even in the end when they asked her about the
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:42.360]  arms deal which by the way has been highly documented by the investigation by whistleblowers
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.000]  everybody knows there was an arms deal at the heart of bin gazi she got away with lying about
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.040]  that which frankly at this point my understanding is the congress is now looking at perjury charges
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.840]  because she had she they have evidence that she did know about the arms deal of trying to get
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.520]  these arms moved around libya pulling him into uh turkey which then in turn uh they were being
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.160]  moved into syria and by the way another guy who i respect immensely was involved in that
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.720]  a lieutenant general mike Flynn the director of bia has admitted on the record that yes he was
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.880]  part of the arms deal he was directed to do this sort of thing so alex that there's just there's
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.880]  just no uh doubt about what was at the center of bin gazi and yet the mainstream media continues
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:27.720]  to ignore it and people like me here continue to you know uh media matters can even now consistently
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.080]  says that somehow i'm fantasizing about what happened at bin gazi it's truly uh it's really
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.320]  bizarre well you were one of the first within a week of it happening to come on this show and to
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.440]  go on fox and other channels and and talk about an arms deal talk about the turkish ambassador
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:48.200]  to break down what happened to warn about missiles getting into the hands of al qaeda uh the fact that
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:53.960]  isis once it came up a few years ago you said no that is a lohabious group as well al al nuzra
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:12:00.040]  is al qaeda that's all been proven to be accurate now and we see this whole thing metastasizing
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.120]  you said last year that there should be criminal charges in a newsmax article for hillary and the
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:12.360]  clear cover up so i would imagine that in a way you might be under more heat now because it is an
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:20.120]  election year why this is interesting because that's yes and no because clearly alex is part of the
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.600]  issue now becomes talk on the other side that the republicans use it to their advantage so
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.280]  i think it's hillary does survive the primaries that the republicans are going to go into this
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.560]  with a great deal of of ammunition to use against her because this is all again on the record so
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.200]  yeah i think my democrat friends are pretty upset with me about the fact that you know
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.920]  that there are democrats who actually recognize what's going on but because they are so
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:47.640]  loyal to their party they choose to look the other way and those are the guys i think i'm
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:53.560]  in most most with odds with but then again you know we we've talked to uh uh part of what i do
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.800]  my job is to talk to the president of candidates i can't say by name who they are but we've talked
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:03.400]  to them all as best we can and uh the idea is what we're going to give them fashionable information
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:10.600]  that is that is based on what is known and can be proven be a hard copy document so this now at
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.560]  this point like you point out now like this this is all hard copy well researched fully
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:22.040]  recognized as fact that there was an arms deal that hillary clinton was involved uh that the deal
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:29.160]  went bad uh that the she knew the night of the attack or the day after the 12th of september
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:37.000]  that uh that you had al-qaeda terrorists involved and frankly i still stand by my belief that they
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.760]  they were fully willing to allow christine's to go to his death knowing something is going to
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.560]  happen sure well i've interviewed other whistleblowers uh after you've been on talks plumbly others
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.880]  cia pilots and others and i've talked to other military people i'm just going to leave it at
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:55.320]  that it's known that there were drones overhead you said that years ago it's come out uh you've
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:00.760]  come out and said you've gotten intel that obama was watching a part of the seven hours as it unfolded
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.840]  i stick by that comment yes well this is just outrageous then i mean is it an arms deal and
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:14.040]  they didn't know what to do or does it go further did somebody in a government outside of al-qaeda
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:20.600]  want to get rid of the ambassador so there wouldn't be any fingerprints on this arms transfer
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:27.960]  well it's it's very clear at this point that that evens was the key he was the pivotal the pivot
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:33.080]  man he do everything he was involved you know it was his interest to do this he they really
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.640]  thought alex the time and this is one of the the biggest conceptions i think what we're going to
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.520]  continue to pay for this for this mistake for years but the muslim brother had to be a trusted
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.880]  ally that they would be a good ally a good proxy to work with us in place of our our our other
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:53.400]  allies and that was what their assumption was so i think when they started seeing that the
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.320]  brotherhood was not going to be a good partner they were too far in to say we can't we can't
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:02.280]  stop it i think they got themselves in over their head i think christy was part of that
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.440]  that completely ill thought uh badly managed effort to bring uh the brotherhood into essentially
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.680]  our sphere of influence and i think because of that because they all start going bad and
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.640]  look hillary clinton's not a stupid woman at all i think they recognize that as as much as they
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.040]  needed to get rid of information to get rid of people this was a good way to kind of let things
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:29.000]  fly and that's why you didn't see i mean alex think about this this was about a little more than a
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.880]  two months out before a major presidential election how was it you don't do maximum effort to go
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:38.520]  recover an ambassador who goes missing think about that if it was under any other president that i
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.280]  know of that would have been the primary thing everybody would have been scrambling to figure
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:47.960]  out where was that well we know they were countermanning the the the orders of the military to save
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.800]  these people and so when they get caught i mean we know they did it it's going to bring them all down
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:58.600]  and and so as you stipulate that there is documentary evidence again that someone ordered
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:04.600]  every command and keep in mind alex there's an automatic process once a terror attack is undergoing
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.920]  once an embassy is under siege there's an automatic process which kicks in that it's
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.800]  basically the the worst case scenario people start moving someone called around to every
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.280]  command and control headquarters and stopped so that means someone had to to literally
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.800]  intercede directly and stopping all of the military actions occurring and this is this
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.640]  remains one of those areas where we we know bits and pieces we don't know the whole picture but
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:32.680]  yes someone did order all the forces which would have been scrambling to get to libya stand down
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.320]  so that why would you do that so that that's that means let me ask you this big question now that
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:44.440]  we see the aftermath years later isis which is just al-qaeda as you do in your organization you go
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.000]  around educate congress you educate the candidates you're in an info war with the truth when the
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.160]  white house three years ago was saying oh these are all good rebels they're wonderful you went and
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:59.000]  exposed that with other military people that it was almost all radical saudi arabian ahabias so
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.040]  they clearly know that then then what are they thinking what's the end game where is this going
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.640]  what are they going to do like i asked you years ago when this first happened what are they going to
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.440]  do when radicals use those stinger missiles and other service air missiles to shoot down
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.560]  airliners they can't cover it all up what's going to unfold what were they thinking i mean you know
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.760]  in the old days just 15 years ago used to run missions some of us come out in the news trying
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:28.360]  to find old stingers you guys would go through all sorts of hell just to get a few old stingers
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.960]  now you've got hundreds of of modern ones being given to these crazies what is the establishment
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.920]  thinking well i at this point in time i think that's part of the issues they got completely out of
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:45.320]  control they they know for example uh i like that that these things are kind of scattered all over
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.720]  and i think this is where the real firm remains because uh the last time a credible terrorist
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:55.080]  organization tried this was al-qaeda in 2002 in kenya where they attempted to take down the
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.040]  two Israeli charter aircraft it didn't work for any number of reasons thank goodness but imagine
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.880]  now we have that that situation where al-qaeda does have and i just does have literally crazy
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.120]  these things and i think this is where we don't know what's going on and i think we're blind
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:14.680]  what's the end game well i don't know exactly what the leadership was thinking other than they
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:20.440]  thought they could cut deals with some of these these really worst of the worst terrorists
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:25.000]  to think that they could be our partners similarly to bring some level of different stability
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.160]  and and frankly you know the whole thing of trying to partner with the free Syrian army
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:34.120]  in the al-nusra front it was all ill-conceived but i think let's be honest with you there's an
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.120]  arrogance on the left now like to permeate their thinking where they think they're the smartest
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:43.240]  people in the room this is the analogy is in raw where you had jeffree skilling right down there
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:47.640]  in texas and in raw thinking that they were the smartest guys in the room and they could do things
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.760]  that no one else has ever done and i think that that's not it's been the one of the the problems
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.560]  would be the left where they will thank you know despite the fact they have all these people available
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.480]  then to will help educate them they think they're smarter than everybody else and go off on these
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:07.880]  real really idiotic ill-conceived concepts of operations which result in a tragedy and i think
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:13.960]  that's what's going on here well i want to recap one of the best moments i've seen in the u.s army
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:21.080]  and just the pentagon in general really showing some moral leadership i mean i wouldn't say mutiny
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.720]  against the president but but just not following illegal orders as you know and if you can talk
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.720]  about some of the inside baseball it's not classified i'd like to hear some more but even came out in
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:36.200]  the news what two years ago when rand paul and senator cruz and others were saying we're not
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:41.160]  going to be al-qaeda's air force the military uh even before that was holding up the signs on the
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.560]  internet saying we're not going to be in a syrian civil war we're not going to back al-qaeda we're
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:50.200]  not going to be part of it and then uh the chairman of the joint chiefs the time general demsy on that
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.520]  saturday night went to obama and it even came out later i was told this but it came out months
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.800]  later and said do not do this you cannot do it it is insane the military isn't going to go along
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:06.440]  with it that is such a historic moment and that's got to really concern the criminals that are running
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:11.800]  this government i'm just going to say it that's like a moment where it's not operation valkyrie
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:16.360]  with the military trying to take out hitler in germany it's just the military saying we're not
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:21.320]  going to follow that order well everybody recognize elix that the people we were trying to support were
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:26.360]  indeed completely affiliated if not wholly owned by al-qaeda so why would you do that and this is
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:32.120]  where you know the solution would be worse than the problem uh look look no no down here president
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:38.760]  Assad is a bad guy he's killed his own people he is truly a death spot but frankly we recognize what
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:45.080]  happened in libya when we allowed for those elements to include al-qaeda and by the way do you remember
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:51.720]  alex uh uh akadapi was warning us saying hey these people who are opposing me are not the simple
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.880]  you know revolutionary thinkers who want democracy these people these folks are al-qaeda
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:01.560]  and sure enough we have a combination of al-qaeda and isis now running libya so this is clearly
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.120]  it's something the military and the people ideal were understood from day one and you cannot bring
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.760]  in al-qaeda thinking that they're going to be an ally to get rid of Assad and think somehow they're
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:16.360]  going to continue to support your position we tried this in afghanistan that we we helped create
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:21.640]  something called the heqani network as part of the uh the akadapi intelligence service back in
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.080]  the 80s to go against the russians well once the russians left the qani network supported
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:32.600]  coming after us that they've been one of the the main killers of of us and afghan forces
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:37.800]  since we've been there so we cannot believe for a minute that al-qaeda or its affiliates or anyone
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:43.720]  who believes like al-qaeda can be dealt with in a friendly way to to achieve a short-term objective
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.280]  and think somehow they're not going to come back after after us to attack us after that fact i think
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:53.160]  dempsley recognize that a number of us recognize that but again we have these political leaders
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:57.560]  who alex think they're smarter than everybody else and they continue to to try to do these
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:04.280]  truly insane dangerous things colonel shaffer is our guest londoncenter.org just segueing briefly
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:10.040]  uh one of your latest books predicts the breakdown of the border uh basically a soft civil war
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.960]  this was two years ago and you said watch it's coming you know this is a lot of
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.840]  stuff i couldn't put in a non-fiction book so i put it in a fiction book i want to talk about
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.600]  that book so i'm going to talk about what's happening in europe but the controlled left
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:28.520]  they're not just this stupid they really hate the west they've said that the head of the un migrant
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:34.040]  agency uh peter southerland has said we want to get rid of western culture they're bringing
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:40.120]  in they admit 80% military age men they're mainly the folks that invaded syria they're not really
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.240]  syrian rebels i mean i know you know all this they're not really syrian refugees what is the plan
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.240]  open borders here open borders there what is the left trying to do why are they so affiliated with
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.760]  radical islamist that would put a hood over their wife's head and and literally not let women drive
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:02.200]  cars why is the left supporting these people well i think the left is especially the vanguard of the
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:07.480]  third world i mean i had a friend of mine basically posit that this morning uh basically they are the
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.800]  third world uh and they're trying to make cuts the third world so that's why you see this sort of
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:17.640]  thing they want to import people who will radicalize who will be established that the basic western
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.880]  principles which have made us very strong the conditions that we've created in the west alex for
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.800]  better for worse of the best mankind has ever seen we have the most people ever who have clean water
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:33.000]  clean homes a good used to be a good healthcare system which is now being diminished by obama
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.480]  care and again this third world idea that we have to be essentially treat everybody the same
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:44.520]  that's what they want this idea they use fairness as a value to say you know alex you live too high
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.200]  you shouldn't be living as well as you do you shouldn't have a nice car you should be living
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.960]  at a level like someone lives in say rural pinia and their idea of fairness is we're all the same
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:59.160]  and anything extraordinary anything that's good or bad it's all the same so i think that's why you
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.720]  see the left work so hard here to be stabilized every western nation and that's something we
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.120]  have to be aware of and then you've got these ultra rich that make their money off of government
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:13.640]  contracts waging war against new rich who actually create jobs and wealth teaming up with the third
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:19.640]  world it is just sickening to watch well well here's the key you predicted it's just crazy how
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.200]  actually been colonel shaffer i'm not kissing your butt it's just no brag just fact you predicted
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:29.400]  right women gazi happened that nexus syria then you said nexus europe what are they going to do i
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:35.000]  think it's not a question of if it when they try or they succeed to shoot down one or more
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.880]  major passenger liners uh on the outskirts maybe east europe russia wherever they can get these
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:44.840]  missiles how can they get the missiles into western europe can they get them into the us
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.080]  how long till that happens or am i wrong can we stop it and then what what do you see happening
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.520]  in syria well this is kind of a part two a two per what you see right now as you point out aptly
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.040]  is that these these males these so-called refugees are not actually military age males are going into
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.040]  the vanguard and the first thing you do is a terrorist organization alex you set up a trusted
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.800]  network to climb this the network once you have the network in place you can move these things
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.040]  around with the community right now they don't have a trusted network that can do that you saw
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.080]  the attacks in france or isis was able to and al-qaeda was able to accuse things under the radar
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:23.320]  they're finding ak-47s full auto from the middle east now in france exactly so that was it that was
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:28.680]  the first test okay it worked so now then if you see it works if you expand it so now you see the
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:33.080]  expansion of phase one of getting all these people into europe and setting up trusted and
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.080]  climbing this network after the network's in place alex they could move the missiles around
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:42.200]  with the security there's no way law enforcement or intelligence can stop and search every single
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:46.840]  vehicle moving around or every single boat coming in and out so again once you get once you flood
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.600]  the market so to speak it makes it infinitely easier to move weapons such as stickers around
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:58.120]  you can deal with an ak-47 on a low scale it basically increased by an order of magnitude and
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:03.640]  then you can do it with impurity that's where they're going with all this the russians uh where do
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.880]  you see the situation in syria going how big of a defeat to obama wasn't that putin came in
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.880]  do you think the russians are being suckered into a new afghanistan what about the plane
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.840]  being shot down well i i think the russians are seeing uh i think it was an attack i think it was
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.560]  done by a lockerby type attack where you had a bomb on the aircraft or a suicide bomber
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.480]  all the pictures i've seen alex in the case today that it was a explosion from the inside not an
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:35.240]  explosion bomb inside right and so uh so and i think the russians have got their first real
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:39.160]  casualties in the war and god bless them i'm glad they're gone they they need to stabilize
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.120]  syria if they can this is our one joint uh objective should be a stabilizing syria even
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.360]  if you don't like a sod stabilize syria because otherwise you're going to continue to be al-qaeda
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.800]  and i just kind of using that region as a base of operation and of course al-qaeda hits russia
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:00.680]  even more than they hit us on average right what do you expect the russians to do if some of the
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:07.640]  voices calling for some type of military containment or a no-fly zone i mean we've all heard the talk
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.880]  from former generals let's start killing russians that's some really dangerous talk it is no the
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.160]  russians are doing what i think we should have been doing i think it's why it's such a big blow
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.960]  to president obama frankly alex and with that said you know our military i've talked to the
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.960]  post senator gun our military will continue to conduct itself professionally with the russians
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:31.320]  we're going to do anything to antagonize them as much as i think uh that that that can't be said
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.760]  of the other side with that said we've got to come to an agreement if what we're focused on
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:39.000]  regarding joint objectives unfortunately long-term we have to accept alex that they're trying to put
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.720]  together what i would call the Damascus pack uh essentially a form of the warsaw pack in the
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:48.280]  middle east where they're joining the iranians uh syria and russians together and we have to look
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:53.240]  at how we can counter that long term but for now we have joint objectives regarding stabilizing syria
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:58.440]  yes trying indeed to stabilize the region that's what we should be sure let's not romanticize russia
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.240]  their elites are just as corrupt as some of ours but exactly we can't lose the moral high ground
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:07.560]  and back a jihad al-qaeda army to run around murdering hundreds of thousands of christians
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:12.360]  absolutely you hit the nail on the head and i think that's what we need to understand the russians
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.080]  and us if we share that one focus area we should focus on that for now and then worry about that
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:21.160]  worry about what to do after that after we defeat isis and al-qaeda i really appreciate you giving
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:26.360]  us time london senator or spend a minute on uh your books you've written and the one predicting
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:32.440]  the border situation well the last five alex you've you've done a great job of allowing me to talk
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:37.400]  about it look we we recognize that you live there they're clearly there than i do in fact the border
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.480]  is breaking down the people wanted to break down so the last line essentially is a kind of looking
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.920]  at all the different people who could be involved and essentially that you point out a soft coup
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:50.200]  d'etat looking at people who have interests that are really meant to undermine and soften our ability
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.000]  to defend the nation uh that's ongoing and it's something we have to all be concerned about uh
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.080]  my first book operation dark art is about the lord afghanistan and uh how we uh how we need to go
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.400]  about trying to we can still pull victory out there and i i'm hopeful that we could do a lot more
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:11.080]  to stabilize that area as well but it takes parts but does not take uh political types
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.000]  who wish basically to have to reinforce their own political power enough to not protect the
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.160]  american people and that's what we should be that's what we should focus on it's scary to have
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.520]  political leadership has never been in the military telling the military what to do
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:27.160]  and we'll see in these disasters colonel shaper thank you so much and thank god for being there
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:31.400]  you're a real hero not just what you did in the military but what you've done now
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.120]  to to to get the information to congress and the people it's been so accurate thank you so much
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.200]  colonel thanks thanks for having me that's an amazing person right there he has risked his
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.440]  life so much domestically for what he's done on been gazi that's one of the main sources that's

[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:17.560]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:28.520]  jones he was talking colonel shaffer was about general flinn the former head of defense intelligence
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:34.280]  who resigned of four or five months ago he went public on national television and said look we
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.800]  were ordered to basically put these people in charge we were ordered to give them weapons in
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.200]  syria that's what happened and they go oh obama didn't know and he goes no we were ordered
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:52.440]  so that is so huge because obama says the opposite when the commanding general says we gave them the
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:34:00.520]  intel they countermanded it and ordered us to arm them but he's saying that in 2015
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:06.600]  shaffer was saying that three years ago and that's when it's dangerous is to say it then i mean when
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.520]  we were covering mangosia a week after it happened with with exactly what happened
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.360]  they called colonel shaffer and because he's involved in a bunch of clandestine
[01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.080]  government groups and operations
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.200]  and they threatened basically and i'm not going to get into the stuff it was behind the scenes but
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.960]  he gets threatened every time he basically comes on the show he's told not to but he still does it and
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.280]  he goes on other shows and exposes it because he's not going to sit there and watch the government
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:41.320]  engage in criminal activities he's not going to follow orders that are illegal and the moral
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:47.160]  of the story is with this show and shaffer and drudge and others telling the truth about this
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:53.640]  from day one they haven't been able to fully back al qaeda to take over syria it is a war crime to do
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:35:01.400]  war crime to do that so there's a battle for the heart and soul of america going on right now in
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:06.760]  government and we're starting to win that fight and that's why the leftist and the controlled
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:14.360]  opposition on the right the neocon leadership they don't want to have a real debate about this
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:20.040]  they want to just basically shale on into the future continuing all this criminal activity
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.600]  but the criminal activity is coming out now and they're not going to get away with it it's a lot
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:31.400]  bigger than ben gazi ben gazi's just one string on an old rotten sweater that if you keep pulling it
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.640]  soon the whole arm unravels but there's a whole bunch of strings and so i don't know which string
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:41.400]  is going to bring the whole thing down but just start pulling strings so we're trying to let sunlight
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:45.720]  in and you're in a castle fighting vampires you know it's noon there's big black curtains
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.280]  and you've got a sword don't even fight the vampires in the dark just get up there and start hacking at
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:55.720]  the curtains and pretty soon there's beams of light all around you and you see the vampires
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:59.960]  and they're hissing wanting to get at you but you're just busy hacking more holes and pretty soon
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.840]  you hack sunlight hits one boom they burst into flames i can't tell you how many of these things
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:10.840]  politically we've burned to the ground and sure out of the depths of hell more of them pour up
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.560]  but there's more sunshine coming in all the time and so they're screaming shut down talk radio
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:21.480]  shut down the internet shut down drudge now see idiots online going leftist to mainly going i don't
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:26.360]  care sure shut him down they're going to shut everybody down they're going to restrict everybody's
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:34.520]  speech if they can shut down rush limbaugh or matt drudge believe me folks they've probably had
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.720]  let's not exaggerate 20 articles or more in the last few months i've seen saying shut alex jones
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:45.960]  down he's dangerous in major leftist publications that take direct talking points for media matters
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:53.960]  in the white house shut me up they just had a big southern poverty law center article saying the
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:37:00.040]  extremists have taken over they're dangerous we've got to shut them up now the leftists never talked
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:03.480]  like that because they had to act like they were really leftists who were into free speech no only
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:10.120]  they're radical garbage they're now shooting their fat mouths off about shutting us up because you
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.520]  think about it if they killed you know a couple dozen people or put us in prison or shut us off
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:20.680]  they could then roll forward you said well that'll wake everybody up no they'll have the college
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:29.480]  people and the mainstream media celebrating it folks at least that's what they think they are
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:36.040]  strongly considering going after everybody i can tell you that not to be alarmist not to
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:41.560]  be sensational that's what i really think and you know i've learned what i think is nine times out
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:54.760]  of ten dead on the social engineers are playing with madness they're playing with fire they are
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:02.440]  pyros political pyroheads that'll burn down your house in a minute i mean they are playing with fire
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.160]  with these open borders they are playing with fire with this drug war they are playing with fire with
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.600]  the gmo they are playing with fire with the medical dictatorship they're playing with fire with the
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:20.280]  hadrian collider they're playing with fire with this fractional reserve banking and flash trading
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:27.320]  and dark pools and derivatives and they do think they're the smartest guys in the room when corzine
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:36.200]  the head of goldman sacks those on the run mf global makes 40 to 1 bets with people segregated
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:44.680]  accounts that didn't even know he bought their gold fund bought their private bank accounts
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:51.160]  and then and i use that as an example because that's crazy folks that's like a degenerate gambler
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:57.480]  that goes and mortgages the family home and goes to vegas for 200 000 and then runs out of it in
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:04.920]  the day and then is busy hawking his wedding ring i mean you're not invincible elite and a lot of
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.600]  them know that they just don't care it's like so exciting to be reckless so exciting to give
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:21.320]  thousands of surface to air missiles to al qaeda so they can go shoot down the syrian air force
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.440]  and then al qaeda goes you know what we're not going to be told what to do with this we're not
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:30.200]  going to ship this where you said we're going to sell this to the highest bidder across the middle
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.240]  east thousands of missiles this is worth billions of dollars we're going to kill you
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:42.200]  you and they send over the Benghazi security force that our government hired that is al qaeda
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.600]  to murder everybody and then they order to stand down now tell me the rest of the story
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:52.440]  they've got some operation chaos planned with those missiles i'm telling you they're going
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:58.120]  to pull something big and the globalists are involved in it saudi arabia has got those
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:04.760]  wahhabis on about a one inch leash and they got something nasty planned i don't know what it is
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:11.400]  but you know what i got my little brain is like a computer working working working trying to figure
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:17.080]  it out now i know there's shows like bling on vh1 about i was only elliptical like 30 minutes this
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:23.000]  morning before i lifted weights for about an hour did a longer workout and they had in the gym
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:30.840]  somebody put vh1 on all the channels so i was looking at like six seven tv's with the audio
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:37.960]  turned off but subtitles for a show called bling and it was 30 minutes that i watched of flashing
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:44.360]  from this jewelry to that jewelry to this house to this car to this yacht only spending about
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:53.800]  a second or two on each purse and kim kardashian in her closet showing off this crap and look
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.680]  it's fine if your wife or your girlfriend wants three or four persons for the for the seasons
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:04.520]  and that's a nice person it's good but it was the mindless worship of hundreds of purses and then
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:11.640]  it was knowing that it was designed for poor people to watch it and to have no idea what they were
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:17.000]  even seeing that it was meant to make them feel inadequate make them to feel pathetic so that
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.680]  they think kim kardashian and and and and kyan west oh it's kanya west and all the rest of these
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:29.320]  people are like gods that that's successful to get out of limos and get out of bentley's and get
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.600]  out of rolls rices and march into restaurants do you have any idea how unhappy those type of people
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:40.200]  are they they live in hell i've been around folks like that i've been around celebrities
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:46.360]  at that level i mean even above charlie chic and they are trying to get out of it it is it is
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:52.760]  hellish when you've been in it for years but they're selling it to you something that you
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:57.800]  can't attain an an an unattain him so that you then feel inadequate so then during the
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.800]  advertisements you've been put in this position with well you can't have kim kardashian who looks
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:08.280]  like the penguin can we pull up kim kardashian slash the penguin and show her next to the penguin
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:17.480]  and show her next to the penguin this is their beauty for us already called the supreme court
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.360]  justice the penguin because she looks like a penguin as well i guess there got to be a penguin
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.960]  to be in power these days and you just sit there and you watch this and you feel inadequate and
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:31.240]  they can show you her she's commercials or car commercials in between it and i just think about
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:35.720]  what they're bombarding women with and then of course their husband can't give them a yacht
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:42.280]  or 14 you know mercedes benz so he's a piece of crap and she doesn't want to be with him
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.520]  just type in kim kardashian as the penguin there it is

[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:20.040]  but i tell you when i saw this article at the daily beast this morning and then i saw another
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:28.520]  article from a Breitbart countering it it chills down my spine literally because
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:36.760]  of what it portents what it means is coming there are all these democrat publications now
[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:42.760]  and obama and anancy polosi and hillary and others saying it's time to confiscate guns it's just
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:49.560]  time to take the guns not just register them but but just take them and i've got the quotes here
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:57.080]  right at the first hour and then their response that but this will upset the black helicopter

[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:06.680]  theoretically agreed that quote confiscation on a massive scale may be the only way to
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:12.760]  solve the american gun violence close quote they admit it but they pointed out that it was not
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:20.760]  realistic and suggested hillary risk causing irreparable divisions by talking about confiscation
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:26.120]  than mocking gun owners as conspiracy theorists waiting for black helicopters to come take

[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:57.480]  or is there a true method of the madness that's succeeded now that's a lot of points i just threw
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:02.440]  out dr coursey but they're trying to start a war against the police obviously so the feds
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:09.160]  can come as the savior they're trying to start a implosion in europe and here as well i think i've
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:13.880]  stated what's happening i want your details on it and if you think it's succeeding and what you
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:19.240]  think the next shoe to drop is dr coursey thanks for coming on with us always a pleasure alex
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:27.000]  let's take this article i wrote on bill airs and the entire analysis of black lives matter
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:33.880]  what um airs is saying is that the black lives matter is really a revolutionary movement
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:44.680]  it drives from communist principles its whole goal is to essentially stir up intensify race
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:53.720]  and class tensions under the idea that police are inherently oppressive to black communities
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:59.240]  and get black communities to feel this so there's an antagonism with the police that results in
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:05.800]  social conflict i mean this is what the you know marxists what uh sol linsky taught
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:14.200]  in rules for radicals it's intensifying these lines of antagonism or social conflict in order
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:21.560]  to create a revolutionary environment and what the far left what airs wants out of black lives matter
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:27.240]  i mean if you think about it seriously it should be all lives matter why are we focusing on black
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:34.360]  lives matter but the underlying theme here the hidden message is that the police are the white
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:43.080]  society's uh institutional institutionalized oppressor of black people designed to keep black
[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:50.600]  people into some subjectivity and when that resentment is fueled the idea is that black
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:57.000]  communities will rise up against the police there'll be more murders and assaults on police
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:03.800]  will have more chaos and that leads to the kind of social chaos and confrontation that the
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:10.200]  radical far left believes that they can use to impose a socialist society it's a totalitarian
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:16.120]  society eliminating guns eliminating the constitutional freedoms we enjoy as americans
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:21.880]  under the idea that we've got a renewal of civil violence throughout the society that's the basic
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:29.720]  underlying intent and goal airs reject programs like teach for america because they call them
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:36.600]  classical liberalism they just put too many teachers in schools and and air says it's not
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:43.720]  about trying to improve grades or educate black children and minority communities what is about
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:51.080]  is the fact that minority communities are part of the colonialism that the radical left wants to
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:59.320]  blame america for continuing as a racist capitalistic society it's really a marxist movement this
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:09.800]  disguise as an obama a reaction to the shootings that occurred over the past couple of summers
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:16.760]  in incidents where black kids usually black thugs and counter police were shot and obamas
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:21.960]  use those incidents black five matters have come out of this to try to produce a revolutionary
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:28.280]  movement against the police that is being consciously used by the far left to disrupt
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:34.120]  society and i wanted to expose this article because it's bill airs in an interview saying
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:40.680]  directly what his goals are and it makes very clear the black lives matter is not just a movement
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:47.720]  for um the civil rights movement for instance in the 60s well dr corcy in austin twice without
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:53.160]  even looking for it i've heard chanting and and in 200 300 people the red flags marched by
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:57.720]  the communists run the black lives matter movement here then i've been to other cities
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:03.560]  and it's the exact same thing and it's all over the world now it seems like communists are coming
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:08.840]  out of the woodwork and you go to their websites i'm like one of their top enemies and then i go out
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:14.680]  to pro-life demonstrations and the same people crawl out from under rocks and attack us i mean so
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.560]  and then we go to ut we've actually gone to their meetings folks that they don't know work for us
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:24.200]  we're doing a report on it we videotaped them uh and they're there with the city council people
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:30.360]  the commissions they're actually in charge of the police review board not to help the police be better
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:35.240]  but to actually federalize them which as you know is this new announcement by the justice
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:42.040]  department last month where the un advises these safe cities uh acts and actually brings that in
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:48.200]  locally to monitor us uh run by the justice department i mean it's very diabolical well and i
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:53.240]  i'm confident that before the end of the obama administration there'll be an effort to sign
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:15:00.600]  on to the un small gun treaty in a major way again bypassing us law which brock obama seems
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:06.680]  perfectly comfortable to do ignoring the senate becoming his own legislator through international
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:12.440]  bodies a same type of approach the obama administration is going to be taking with global warming here
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:19.240]  in the paris conference of the un soon to impose carbon controls of the economy and here the agenda
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:27.240]  with black lives matters the agenda uh with the obama signing this un small guns treaty is ultimately
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:33.240]  to disarm the american people to create a pretext in which guns can not only be registered but
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:39.880]  confiscated they want to start a mini localized uh unevenly distributed revolution against local
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:46.360]  government make it a classist struggle and of course it's the it's the strong city's un initiative
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:52.440]  and then literally have the feds come in then left as feds uh as the negotiators or as the
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:58.760]  referees correct dr corcy i mean if you get a city that goes into actual chaos and shooting you
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:04.680]  know where a black community would rise up and begin shooting whites or uh or vice versa i mean
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:09.480]  you get that kind of an incident then you've got the pretext to declare martial law to come in
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:15.640]  to impose a militarized police with military assistance and go house to house and confiscate
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:23.080]  guns i mean i think we saw some trial runs of this with the um boston bombers when they were on the
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:28.760]  loose were basically in various communities surrounding boston the militarized police moved
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:35.160]  into one house to house and began asking people why they had guns and taking them away this is again
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:41.560]  the far left and obama's intent is to use every one of these school shooting incidents every incident
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:50.280]  he can find where he can fan these flames of fear of you know gun violence or fear of violence period
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:57.000]  as a pretext for disarming america the second amendment is clearly the target and the second
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.960]  amendment is the target because it's the one issue which stands between totalitarianism on the left
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:10.360]  and the you know the protection of the constitution as much as it's been eroded uh the second amendment
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:17.000]  still allows the american population uniquely in the world to be armed i agree let me ask you this
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.360]  question before we go to break and then i want to get a geopolitical stuff and the economy with
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:29.320]  you dr corcy how is it going for them the political air the groups you talk to how are things going
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:33.880]  right now for this leftist coalition in europe and the united states with their new world order
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:39.640]  well i think there's finally beginning to be cracks and pushback i mean the you see in the
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:44.600]  it's pushed back as well by the way against the republican party the establishment republican
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:49.800]  parties become indistinguishable from the establishment democratic party although the
[02:17:49.800 --> 02:17:55.720]  democratic parties move much farther to the left and what's happening is i think the americans are
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:18:03.480]  waking up shows in your show what you've been doing we've been writing at wnd trying to awaken
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:10.200]  the american people to know that this is a social revolution and the goal of the obama far left is
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:15.720]  the destruction of the constitution and especially the first amendment the second amendment we've
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:24.200]  got a major social re-engineering going on with redefinition of marriage redefinition of sexuality
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:31.880]  the influx of now just not immigrants from south of the border but immigrants from islamic immigrants
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:38.600]  fleeing northern africa in chaos that by the way obama caused with the this and hillary clinton
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:43.640]  and the u n and peter southerland admit they want to end european culture they admit they want to
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:49.560]  bankrupt it that's what's so crazy why would this elite this in control actually want to wreck
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:55.240]  everything they are mentally ill well and you would think that you know if europe had been able
[02:18:55.240 --> 02:19:00.520]  to still have a second amendment or any rem you know remnant of being armed the governments like
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:05.640]  germany and france these other governments would have a much harder time just saying to a community
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:12.120]  of a hundred people here's 700 you know radical muslims from who knows what country in north
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:18.600]  africa and they're now your neighbors all right this is the kind of a demographic revolution
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:25.640]  that is designed to fundamentally erode european traditions well it's ultra aggressive i mean how
[02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:31.320]  do they expect the town of 102 folks that's a new york time story endorsing it to take 700 plus people
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:37.240]  well it's calculated to fundamentally change the culture to change the culture in islamic
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:43.320]  direction to move again for gun confiscation and other issues against the second amendment
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:48.040]  against the first amendment this is the left conquering us with radical third world populations
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:53.640]  and the more radical the better i mean this is so treasonous we'll be back with dr corcy

[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:28.280]  259 92 31 1800 259 92 31 dr. Corsi of course is a new or times number one best-selling author
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:32.840]  a political researcher and a phd in political science he also has degrees in economics i'm
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:36.840]  going to get it all his degrees all the things he's done but in the limited time let's talk
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:42.360]  Syria real quick talk economy and other issues and what's the state of the world right now
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:48.920]  in your prognosis dr. Corsi well i think the international economy is closer to collapse
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:54.840]  than ever i mean the amount of debt that we're building up with obama doubling the u.s. debt
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:25:01.480]  it's going to be 20 i'm sure 20 trillion with a t u.s. debt by the time obama leaves office
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:08.520]  and europe is piling up debt i mean the debt china has had a massive sell-off of its foreign
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:13.720]  reserves just to prop up its currency the stock market looks good right now but the
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:21.560]  fundamentals of stocks are not there to support this price these prices and i can see the stock
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:28.280]  market collapsing by five six thousand points any day when the federal banks realize they can no
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:35.720]  longer just keep printing money the situation in syria and in the middle east has never been
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:41.400]  more chaotic and more dangerous i like to emphasize it's that way by design i mean the obama
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:48.600]  administration and hillary clinton destabilized libya uh supporting al-qaeda changing sides
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:55.640]  and now russia's come in with ground troops and air troops and the potential of a confrontation
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:02.680]  between russia and the united states escalates every day obama does not have a strategy the
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:07.800]  strategy is going to be almost abandonment of the middle east by the united states in chaos
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:15.080]  and the goal seems to be to push millions of muslims in the europe to destabilize europe
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.640]  i mean in a sense i think it's why candidates like donald trump are doing well
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:27.400]  ted cruise uh ben carson i mean when you take a look at hillary clinton it's more of the corrupt
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:36.760]  you know the pay for play uh role she played the lying of the the continuation of a corrupt world
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:41.000]  order that hillary clinton represents i think is going to be very tough for the democrats
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:48.840]  to sell in 2016 it is if the clintons don't get indicted soon over the clinton foundation fraud
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:53.880]  and i've been writing a series of stories with charles or tell the financial analysts i think
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:27:00.520]  they should lead to prosecution indictment and prosecution of both bill and hillary clinton
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:07.560]  for fraud monetizing the white house and using this clinton foundation as a personal piggy bank
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:12.920]  violating charity laws of the international situation and our domestic politics are in chaos
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:20.040]  right now and it's it's intentionally chaos this is this is what communism looks like just before
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:24.280]  the attempt to produce revolution that's right this is the standard playbook for the destabilization
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:28.600]  period and then once they take us over they'll use us in the exploitation period against the next
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:35.080]  target uh i just can't believe how naked the corruption is it really is bizarre and to see
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:40.760]  democratic hordes of people uh because i'm really nonpartisan as you know really endorsing criminal
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.280]  gangsterism when they're the ones being screwed over by it i mean we could see the fall of america
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:51.960]  very very soon well and i think it's also it is bipartisan i mean the american voters are rejecting
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:58.440]  the republican establishment just as much as the democrats are getting rejected and candidates like
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:05.000]  donald trump i think are going to draw from across the spectrum uh the last chance america has is if
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.840]  you know the patriots those who are trying to be branded as extremists by the obama
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:15.400]  administration they you know the people who support the constitution who support the founding
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:22.680]  fathers still believe in god uh say no we've had enough and we're not giving up the second amendment
[02:28:22.680 --> 02:28:29.320]  and we're not giving up the first amendment this attempt by the supreme court to impose you know
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:36.040]  upon america a whole new definition of sexuality and marriage just because supreme court's decided
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:41.720]  this i don't think you're going to change the religious practices across america of millions
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:46.600]  of people who you know really want to pursue their own and have a right under the first amendment
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:54.280]  to pursue their own ideas about god and religion so we're in a major upheaval and i think the
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:29:02.440]  economics globally is about to collapse and when that does you'll have massive chaos because the
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:08.520]  invasion from uh middle east through syria libya all these countries is going to continue
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:13.000]  you and europe will probably be pushed to the brink of civil war certainly in countries like
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.760]  germany which are just going to basically take to the streets if they have to and i think we're
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:24.520]  in for one of the most ugly peak periods coming in you know recent human history i agree with you
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:30.360]  we're in the middle of a globalist leftist in game 21st century military takeover using economics
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:35.880]  and migrant hordes it's incredible jerome coursey dot com wnd dot com dr coursey thank you so much

[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:29.960]  all this insane news by the way nasa came out yesterday and i didn't get to it and i saw it
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:35.400]  back on the news today and admitted that the satellite show that the ice has gotten thicker
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:42.600]  and bigger thicker and is covering more surface arctic and Antarctic north and south
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:51.960]  it's supposed to be gone by 2013 algor said in 2006 and no one called him on it in the controlled
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:58.840]  media and of course there's always big pieces breaking off it's always done that they go
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:05.960]  look icebergs we're all dead it's melting it's the pieces are falling off we're all just playing
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:12.040]  on the ignorance of the public big ones they're dying they can't swim polar bears they're falling
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:17.960]  in but if you're gonna lie why not go all the way just say polar bears can fly and that global warming
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:24.520]  cut their wings off look at this polar bear it did have a 30-foot wingspan until the enemies of
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:33.800]  captain planet use tweezers to pull them off aquaman had to summon three giant whales to deal with
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:44.360]  the evil polluters yeah i used to say that uh polar bear swim 300 miles people didn't believe me
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:49.800]  but there's a daily mail article where they uh in 2012 did a study i hadn't seen this
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:59.640]  where they can swim straight for 400 miles and i have covered because i was in a pizza place
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:05.000]  the corpus christian saw it where the school that then they had their stuff hung at the local pizza
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  place did a contest it was actually the port a pizzeria i say corpus christi decent pizza no no
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:19.800]  but they had all these kids things hanging by i did a video on it where they had a contest to show
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:24.200]  how the penguins and polar bears were were having their habitats they were drowning
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:34.840]  the polar bear can swim 400 miles and they hunt by jumping off one ice flow to go to another
[02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:43.880]  to hunt beluga whale and they love it a polar bear a large male can pull up a 2000 pound
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:50.280]  beluga with one arm they've been videoed in fights with grizzly bears they kill them in seconds
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:55.640]  this is a super animal toughest land animal there is and these people lie to you and say they can't

[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:08.680]  it's moving in the hydrology and salt water freezes at a lower level one time i was debating some
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:13.000]  gone talk radio about it he goes oh yeah the polar bears are in freezing water how are they swimming
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:20.680]  in freezing water it's just the the the the the the abject ignorance of these people i got two
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:28.760]  clips to plan i'm going to your phone calls yeah that's a uh some kind of larger whale he's that's
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:33.160]  one that washed up i don't think he killed that one but i'm telling you they're incredible beast
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:37.480]  if you're a radio listener we also have a tv side show me talking about stuff we're showing
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:42.840]  it's on info wars dot com present planet dot com other sites like that now let's go to obama saying
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:49.640]  the g.o.p candidates occupy different reality and this is reality inverted from ap as we analyze
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:58.600]  this ap piece part of fair use the g.o.p finally didn't let themselves be bullied by staged questions
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:06.200]  it was an admitted route of c nbc they've left nbc now as a punishment it's the mainstream media
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:11.880]  collapsing in front of everyone then polls all show that but he spends it and says how are they
[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:19.800]  going to handle foreign policy when they can't even handle c nbc they dominated c nbc and they
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:24.680]  weren't reading off teleprompters obama and they weren't running against john mccain either let's
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:33.560]  go to this clip i don't know if the republicans who are running for this office know any of these
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:38.760]  things he's all the smart democrats are there's a new mark dies video where all the democrat
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:50.760]  women want to read a law because they occupy a different reality it seems yeah well you're not
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:57.240]  coming after our guns according to them everything was really good in 2008 and according to you when
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:01.480]  we were going through the worst the debt limit doesn't raise the debt crisis in our lifetimes
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:04.840]  we're being fear-mongered and the bank's taking over it's totally staged unemployment and uninsured
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:10.520]  rates were up and we were hopelessly addicted to foreign oil and bin laden was still on the loose
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:17.880]  oh he got bin laden was the golden age that i messed up no you're all part of the my part of
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:25.160]  the screw job the planet's warming 99 of scientists have said it's warming and we've got the republic
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:29.960]  he used to say all sciences degree debate is over they turned out thousands of science were put on
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:35.000]  this list those are only 80 something percent were never contacted they were just told will you
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  contribute to a climate report if we ever call you yes they put them on the consensus list and
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:44.040]  said they agreed now if they come out they'll fire them won't publish their books they want to arrest

[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:58.520]  idiot audience he's still doing the old warming no no they already abandoned that one obama
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:04.520]  because nasa had to admit it's it's it's cooling now it's change but see for the morons he still
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:10.200]  uses the old line keeping them in that false reality let's go to the club and and we've got

[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:51.960]  you don't answer the questions it came across as you lying and saying you were a race that you
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:56.040]  weren't am i correct was you you know a headline a single headline yeah change
[02:42:56.840 --> 02:43:03.880]  even now sitting here asking you we're saying why not say you're white but you identify as being
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:12.120]  black and you you don't seem to answer the question straight on my my question yeah not identify how
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:17.160]  you identify like why not give me the right to identify how i identify i give everybody else
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:21.720]  so that's what it is it's like the training stuff we are all entitled to be correct exactly who we
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:28.280]  are in it to identify it i think it's kind of hard i mean look she puts tanner on her skin so when
[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:33.320]  you she sits there and just does everything with these fake mannerisms you know what i mean like
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:38.600]  you're not you weren't born black so when you say you are black it makes it hard for people to
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:42.520]  understand why i think she's a joke and you know we're allowed to think you're a joke just like
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:47.160]  jenner's a joke the whole creepy guy with a wig on we're supposed to bow down to you know we're sick
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:44:03.240]  of it yeah you're black yeah whatever obama identifies as black is

[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:54.360]  engineered narrative it's no more true than saying a couple of beers is going to force you to drink
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:46:01.640]  a handle of vodka every night um do you know what telomeres are yes i do know what uh telomeres are
[02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:08.520]  in the dna before we go there he specifically was hitting the fact that george soros is pushing
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:16.040]  hardcore weaponized marijuana it's like 90 thc when the strongest stuff used to be 25 max
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:22.680]  and that many people then never develop live in their parents basement forever and uh basically
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:28.360]  get brain damage from it marijuana is an amazing plant it has thousands of different medical
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:33.720]  applications it's it's you know it's right up there uh with things like aloe vera maybe even
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:39.480]  more powerful maybe one of the most versatile plants ever uh in pharmacia so so that's one debate
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:44.600]  but then people that just smoke dope all day and push it and say it's a cure for this a cure for
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:48.600]  that when it's just a treatment for things and a great treatment for a lot of things glaucoma you
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:54.840]  name it they exaggerate and it becomes a cult and so he was going at it from that angle i am against
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:47:01.560]  the drug war itself i'm for decriminalization but i think we should also talk about how destructive
[02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:08.360]  weaponized marijuana can be uh now go ahead and elaborate your point i think the uh the
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:14.840]  destructive part of that would be uh the chemical processed forms of it so like a hydroponic version
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:20.440]  where you're pumping chemicals into it i mean no different than any gmo product um but in its true
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:27.960]  base form i mean phc is not bad uh higher values of phc will actually contribute to helping people
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:35.800]  rid of adhd or uh any other type of uh there are some studies that it does a lot better than speed
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:41.320]  pills like ritalin or other things that burn your brain out it actually does help some people that
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.360]  are overactive uh minds and a lot of that if you get kids off red dyes processed foods sugar
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:50.280]  that's the real answer but sure if you're going to drug them in a lot of studies it's been proven
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:57.240]  that low dosages of pure thc are better uh for children's brains than say something like adderall
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:04.120]  but i mean adderall is absolutely hardcore and fetamin and so i think comparing it to it is not
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:09.320]  fair but i get your point i hear what you're saying uh but you have to also get the perspective of
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:13.880]  what savages talking about i know that's a famous statement from the 30s you know it's a gateway drug
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:21.320]  in the 60s but it probably is a gateway drug at certain levels but the argument that it's a gateway
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:26.280]  drugs let's put people in prison for it is wrong let's not put anybody in prison for being a user
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:33.400]  and let's admit some drugs have good applications if they're not abused but at the same time i don't
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:37.720]  think we then jump the other direction and fooling endorse it and i agree with savage
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:43.800]  on why george soros is so deeply involved in it and tonight we'll hear from savage on that
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:49.640]  point when we rear that seven o'clock nightly news thank you eric brandon infima region three
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:56.760]  you're on the air go ahead hey i like uh i just wanted to start off by saying god bless you we're
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:05.000]  praying for you uh i wanted to tell you a quick story i was recently in dallas uh i just got engaged
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:11.080]  was uh spending some time with my fiance's family and i went out to a bar with some of her older
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:16.440]  brothers and a lot of these guys were like extreme arrays and i think one was even a seal at one point
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:21.960]  and uh they were telling me that uh you came up in conversation because i was wearing an info
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:26.920]  war shirt and that one of her brothers smiled at me he's like that's gonna have extreme people
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:32.920]  like a legend in special forces i don't know why they say that because i went and followed some
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:39.080]  of their live events and exposed some of it and videotaped that but i've had way back then they're
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:42.600]  like yo we know who you are when i would be like being in the town they were doing some drills
[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:46.920]  you're a legend following us around because i think other media was following them around
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:52.760]  and so i was the only name they knew so anytime somebody was following them they thought it was me
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:57.640]  and and so i really don't deserve any titles there but we did used to follow them around because the
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:03.160]  media kept saying it didn't exist so i got matter and matter and so i would like get tips and fly
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:08.280]  all over the country probably like 10 times or well more than 10 probably 10 or so times following
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:13.480]  the army around marines that much but my listeners started following them around and so they started
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:18.200]  thinking i was just everywhere so i think my listeners are legendary and special forces
[02:50:18.200 --> 02:50:22.200]  because we made them all admit they were doing these covert drills but i was just trying to get
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:27.880]  the media to stop lying about it but go ahead he mentioned to me he's like he's right on point
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:32.360]  on everything he's saying he's saying when alex says that delta force is training the least
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:35.800]  when people say doing well listen i want to hear that when we come back because your your

[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:38.600]  the break you were saying you're hanging out with your fiance and their family there's a bunch
[02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:42.680]  of military people there and they were talking about delta force training local police departments
[02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:50.680]  go ahead yeah he was telling me to go check out an old tv show it was like on the air in 2014
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:55.800]  and it's called crisis and he said the plot in that show there's delta force that's working for the
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.880]  cia and they go around killing members of the press he said that's predictive program and he
[02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:04.760]  said delta force has been trained police departments on records since the early 80s and he said that
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:09.560]  they're going to start rolling it out and they'll say oh someone so died of a harm pack when you
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:13.240]  know him and his entire family was basically executed by a bunch of deltas well that's how
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:18.840]  i went to saucaro a few days ago and in that it's very accurate we told people 20 years ago delta
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:24.280]  force was in mexico and it's got delta force there and they're they're expanding the squadrons
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:28.760]  there's a bunch of groups outside of delta force i mean the real groups don't even have names and
[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:35.720]  they're private operators that reconvene who are basically outside of everything uh and yes they are
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:41.480]  trying to mainline uh using them in operations domestically and they're trying to get rid of
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:46.520]  the good people that are patriots in the military who won't go around killing members of the press
[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:52.040]  and and i mean that's why they've had delta force and navy seals and you know groups like xz
[02:55:52.040 --> 02:55:57.720]  with piles of cocaine naked with like you know 20 hookers they're really trying to demoralize
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:02.040]  these people but the movies act like they're invincible and god you know what's going to
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:06.840]  really happen is other people in the military when they find out stuff like this goes on
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:11.320]  it'll be six months a year later those guys are just going to get killed so i mean if they start
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:14.680]  going around killing patriots it's not going to go too well for them i can tell them that
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:21.640]  told me that uh when you get into the green berets and delta force you in front he said you
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:27.720]  graduate into the cia he said that's public record all these specialized units they are cia they're
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:34.040]  just working for the military and it's a takeover of the military by the cia and they are just
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:38.840]  totally turning them into and when i say cia that's a whole glomer in itself bigger than coca
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.960]  cola people think it's also prestigious this person was in cia that was in cia i mean it's
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:49.160]  just an absorption of the whole economy and it's not free market and it's wrong so we talked about
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:55.160]  cia the cia is just a cutout for all that as well i appreciate your call edward in florida
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:59.880]  you're on the air say you're in the army the topic of naval base with chinese ships go ahead
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:04.520]  edward thanks for holding so yeah you're going going to the capital at the beginning of the
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:08.760]  segment you talked about essentially it's mental you know we have some mental illness in this
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:13.640]  country with with the leadership and then today i kind of got to use first hand they actually
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:20.040]  welcomed three chinese warships into mayport florida near jacksville and they're literally
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:24.760]  walking around base with their commie hats they're running the the chinese flag on the ship
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:29.480]  like it's and no one everyone's just driving by it like no big deal you know hundreds of you guys
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:35.960]  i know they've given and there's the article on screen a navy dot mill they have basically
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:41.160]  handed over most of our bases on the east and west coast deep water ports to the chinese government
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:48.120]  panamal canal it's a total sellout yeah it's i think we look at this like well what's going on
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:52.760]  this south china sea and what's going on with you know the today with on drugs the submarine
[02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:57.720]  that was stalking the uss ron oregano japan you know it like it's it's like i don't think it's uh
[02:57:58.280 --> 02:58:03.320]  it's bipolar geopolitan you know one end we're fighting the shabby the other end we're we're
[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:07.960]  you know hanging out with them doing joint middle motor drills well that's the balance it's like
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:12.840]  the globalists say look you can have america that's the deal they made a deal really 30 years ago with
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:17.560]  china to give them our ports give them our area let them have economic dominance but they're not
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:22.440]  supposed to move military in and china's been breaking that moving military into africa moving
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:27.880]  into the caribbean moving them into latin america moving them in to the south china sea so the globalists
[02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:34.040]  are still following one old policy of letting them take over but going hey wait you're breaking the
[02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:39.480]  deal it's a truly scary edward great call thanks for alerting us to that we confirmed it greg another

[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:56.280]  up on info wars dot com uh right now let's go to greg and new jersey thanks for holding her on the
[03:00:56.280 --> 03:01:02.680]  year hey alex uh so here's a classic example of your problem reaction solution scenario uh the
[03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:06.760]  new jersey department of education is you know crying about you know they have poor test results
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:11.560]  of the students so in 2010 they applied for a federal grant to create a database that tracks
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:16.440]  every single piece of data on the kids including name religion social security number health
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:22.360]  conditions photo etc so they built a database and then like magic democrats in the state assembly
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:28.520]  passed a bill authorizing the database in 2014 how magical and magically all the cars have boxes
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:31.960]  that track you as well and are getting ready to tax you they just fell on the cars by accident
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:37.400]  that's it it's like magic well i kind of like blew the whistle on the whole operation so
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:40.840]  uh now people are starting to find out that not only do they want to collect just the
[03:01:40.840 --> 03:01:44.360]  data on the kids while they're in school now they want to make it mandatory to collect the
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:49.320]  student data after they grow i'm glad you blew the whistle on that because it's a nexus then
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:54.360]  with that kernel of info into everything else to build that data map great job greg did you
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:01:58.840]  put it on a website or something so folks can read about it it's already been on the state's
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:04.040]  big radio station at 105 it's going to be going into the paper shortly uh people there's also a
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:08.680]  special uh like community activist group you know people asked me how i got involved the truth was
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:13.480]  by the end of high school i was calling into talk radio shows and changing the whole topic
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:18.440]  and then seeing snowball effects and actually defeating state bills just because i made a
[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:23.480]  few calls literally it causes a snowball i'm nothing special and that's why i did what i did
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:27.800]  and i love what you did i mean i believe you did that i remember reading about that just
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:34.440]  last week you found out you made calls it caused a chain reaction you you you made the spark
[03:02:34.440 --> 03:02:41.080]  we salute you greg bad ass write an article about it send it to info wars dot com jerry in florida
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:45.080]  go ahead i think you're the last call we got time for uh luke maybe they get to him in the next
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:50.520]  segment but jerry go ahead no lucky me now i hate following guys like that last guy because he
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:55.320]  does stuff actually i just talk about no talking about something does do it because then you alert
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:03:01.640]  others go ahead yeah um listen as far as the immigration thing goes you know i a while back
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:05.640]  i think it was something last year you had a guy i think his name was amamado or amamado or something
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:13.160]  he talked about a guy in a couple people called rosario and on which is much like uh the cloward
[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:18.840]  piven but from the asian side and we're really seeing that now number one is from from the asian
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:24.280]  side the other thing is man you do a pretty good aquaman and so i do you do better aquaman and you
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:30.120]  do a cobalt commander really i think yeah you know it's funny though is when we were kids and we played
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:34.440]  superheroes my friend steven was always aquaman i thought man i was really gay and then turned out
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:41.480]  to be gay so well there you go who's gay yeah my friend steven i don't think aquaman was i just
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:45.160]  always could get the well in the riders can make aquaman whatever they want because he's not and
[03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:49.800]  now that disney owns it they're gonna be anti-t party anti-family whatever the point is to be one
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:54.920]  thing if they had a gay character it's like all of them are gay every you know a person is is
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:04:00.040]  interracial in their relationship and trannies with the king i mean it's it's just it's a cultural
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:05.640]  takeover and a force feeding is my major issue with it but what was his name ted knight he was
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:10.120]  the guy that did the caddyshack voices or he was the guy that played the judge schmales and caddyshack
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:17.720]  he was the voice of aquaman and so i can do a pretty good ted knight invitation but i have to
[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:24.760]  kind of get warmed up into it but uh meanwhile back at the hall of justice greek and others combined
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:32.840]  forces meanwhile apache chief is out surveying in the midwest what might be a strange alien craft
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:39.560]  so i've got to uh kind of if i've got the lines i can do it but i need to focus on that that is my
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:45.000]  second career i've actually made a living in voiceovers as a side issue uh but i just don't
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:49.320]  have time to go do the auditions so thank you for saying i do good voices yeah i'm actually a highly
[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:54.120]  paid voice uh actor i just don't have time to do it all right david night's coming up charlene
[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:59.400]  luke probably able to get to you that at night coming up did you know governments around the
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:03.880]  world are attacking your free speech online in an attempt to control the internet like cable tv for
[03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:08.200]  one thing governments are paying online trolls to sway public opinion the turkish israeli and
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:12.680]  chinese governments along with a host of others are paying companies to quote correct misinformation
[03:05:12.680 --> 03:05:17.320]  on web forms and the u.s government has even hired a data security firm to create large numbers of
[03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:21.640]  fake social media profiles that could be used to spread propaganda while also encountering
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:25.640]  anti-establishment viewpoints online also an increasing number of mainstream news outlets
[03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:29.720]  are disabling or severely restricting comment sections to sodden out critics that challenge
[03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:34.120]  to prevailing status quo pushed by the media for example popular science said it was killing its
[03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:38.680]  comment section to silence global warming skeptics in other words they don't want readers to have
[03:05:38.680 --> 03:05:43.320]  the ability to sway public opinion against their agenda the ultimate end game is to both eradicate
[03:05:43.320 --> 03:05:47.480]  free speech on the internet and to turn the internet into a tightly controlled medium where only
[03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:51.080]  government approved viewpoints are allowed in other words governments want to bury the truth

[03:08:05.560 --> 03:08:14.200]  there's a war on for your mind welcome back to the alex jones show on this november 3rd 2015
[03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:19.560]  we're exactly one year away from the presidential election and today we have some elections in
[03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:23.560]  various places there's an election going on in ohio we're going to talk briefly about what's up
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:29.080]  with that looks like they're trying to set up a monopoly on marijuana well i thought we already
[03:08:29.080 --> 03:08:34.600]  did that with war on drugs oh that was a black market monopoly now the guys want to go legit
[03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:40.680]  you know like michael corleone let's take this out of the black market let's go into a strictly
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:45.320]  legal market but let's still keep it a monopoly because that's what prohibition always does
[03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:50.440]  it creates monopoly so they're going to create a prohibition monopoly that'll have a little bit
[03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:54.040]  of a different twist on it so we'll talk about what's up with that but i got this press release
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:59.080]  about the election that's being held in texas today specifically in austin there was a press
[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:04.600]  release that came out from a variety of people travis county citizens great panthers and la raza
[03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:10.840]  roundtable la raza roundtable is concerned and i think they have a legitimate gripe uh gripe here
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:15.640]  about uh the fact they're not printing results and tallies have been given instructions not to
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:20.760]  do that and violation appears of state election laws so they've been told at the polling places
[03:09:20.760 --> 03:09:26.680]  do not print the results at each polling place because they use those election monitors use
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:32.280]  those to verify the state total so i think they're absolutely right about that but i had to scratch
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:37.640]  my head when i saw la raza roundtable talking about that because you know it's racist if you
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:43.640]  want to authenticate the voters themselves how do we support that i mean is it racist then to
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:49.240]  have regulations to require printing tallies so you can check those tallies
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:55.240]  there's so many different places where election fraud can occur and the first place it can occur
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:10:02.200]  is with people who aren't citizens voting but la raza doesn't want us to validate or verify the
[03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:07.160]  voters just the totals that they get at the local area so i thought that was kind of interesting
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:14.120]  we're also going to talk about what's going on in the vatican we have two new books this week
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:21.240]  that are exposing massive tales of mismanagement at the very least but perhaps criminal actions
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:25.800]  money laundering market manipulation going on within the vatican bank and what's the response
[03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:33.080]  of the pope who wants to tell us that we have to create a world government in order to stop
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:37.720]  climate change that's a moral issue that we have to redistribute wealth that's a moral issue yeah
[03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:42.600]  he's redistributing wealth all right and we're going to look at the details of that so this
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:46.760]  same pope his response to the corruption that's going on there is to have the people arrested
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:51.800]  so they're setting in a vatican jail right now same thing we see from our government
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:56.680]  whenever you've got a whistleblower exposing corruption and fraud and abuse and criminal
[03:10:56.680 --> 03:11:03.160]  actions it's not the criminals who go to jail it's the whistleblowers who go to jail and that's
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:06.920]  what's happening in the vatican so we got a lot of different articles here that we're going to
[03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:12.440]  talk about i want to go first to the caller who's still waiting for us luke in arizona you wanted
[03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:18.920]  to talk about social media go ahead hello hi david it's good to speak with you yeah i just wanted
[03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:25.720]  to bring to attention an article i saw on the dredge report the teen instagram star speaks out
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:32.120]  about the ugly truth behind social media fame uh she quit social media and posted a youtube video
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:36.760]  or final youtube video and a lot of points that she made about why she you know how she felt empty
[03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:41.240]  how it wasn't an end in itself and all the things like that uh they sounded a lot like the things
[03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:45.960]  that alex classically says about social media and about how you know what it will do to you and how
[03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:51.720]  it can get into your brain and infect you uh so i just wanted to bring that uh attention to people
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:56.440]  and uh thought maybe you guys might want to speak with her or talk to her especially because
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:01.160]  once again it's very fresh and uh she's just kind of kind of she's kind of like a disillusioned
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:05.160]  you know uh part of the system well you know of course uh when matt dredge was here he talked
[03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:09.880]  about how social media was a ghetto to trap you in it and julien assange has warned people and i
[03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:14.440]  wish i had the exact wording of the quote is very well written uh he said that basically facebook
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:18.680]  has all of your friends wearing a wire for the government uh they're going to take whatever you
[03:12:18.680 --> 03:12:24.760]  say on social media they will misconstrue it take it out of context use it to attack you perhaps arrest
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:31.080]  you perhaps send a swat team to your house you need to be aware of the fact that facebook and
[03:12:31.080 --> 03:12:35.720]  all the social media has essentially been set up as a monitoring device just like the rest of the
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:42.200]  internet we can use it in some ways for good we can use it to communicate and to uh expose things
[03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:48.840]  but we also need to understand that they are watching uh thank you luke uh let's let's go to this issue
[03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:54.200]  here that's on the ballot today in ohio new york times reports on the ballot ohio grapples with
[03:12:54.200 --> 03:13:00.040]  the specter of a marijuana monopoly and they talk first to a guy who's been a member of a
[03:13:00.040 --> 03:13:07.000]  international cannabinoid research society uh he's worked for decades his life's work has been to
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:13.240]  stop the criminalization of marijuana and he's going to vote against this because here's what
[03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:18.440]  they're going to do today this is issue number three in ohio this proposed amendment is being
[03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:24.040]  bankrolled this is new york times by wealthy investors spending nearly 25 million dollars
[03:13:24.040 --> 03:13:30.040]  to put it on the ballot and to sell it to the voters if it passes they will have exclusive
[03:13:30.040 --> 03:13:36.680]  rights to grow commercial marijuana in ohio and i would add also to sell it the proposal has
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:42.440]  strange bedfellows coalition of opponents law enforcement officers doctors state lawmakers
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:48.760]  and others who warned that it would enshrine a monopoly in the ohio constitution see there i
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:54.120]  did that 44 years ago it was just a black market monopoly and nobody is asking the fundamental
[03:13:54.120 --> 03:14:00.760]  question why do we have a government that prohibits anything there's no power to do that under the
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:04.120]  constitution the federal government's war on drugs it could be done at the state level
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:08.840]  constitutionally the states have the power that they could prohibit stuff i would think
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:13.240]  that people would vote a government like that out but we haven't voted a government like that out
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:19.480]  for 44 years i guess we really haven't had an opportunity because uh the two phony choices
[03:14:19.480 --> 03:14:26.120]  that were given every election are both in on the fix and here's the fix when we had alcohol
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:32.520]  prohibition we had an amendment to the constitution that was required to have alcohol prohibition
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:37.720]  we've got two amendments out of 20 some odd amendments one to pro to allow them to have
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:42.680]  the power to prohibit alcohol and a second one to take that away they had to put that in because
[03:14:42.680 --> 03:14:47.560]  under the ninth intent the amendment the federal government has no right to prohibit anything they
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:53.320]  also don't have the right to to force you to take vaccines they don't have the right to withhold
[03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:59.720]  medicine from eternally ill patients but we have allowed them to take that we have allowed them
[03:14:59.720 --> 03:15:05.480]  to turn our lives into privileges that they grant to us things that they dole out to us like
[03:15:05.480 --> 03:15:11.560]  we're children on an allowance we have stood by and let them do that somebody has to point out
[03:15:11.560 --> 03:15:16.680]  that they have no legal authority under the constitution to prohibit anything the dea needs
[03:15:16.680 --> 03:15:22.200]  to be shuttered tomorrow and if we had somebody who cared a thing about the constitution running for
[03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:27.720]  office at any level they would talk about that now when we look at this and we look at what these
[03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:32.680]  monopolists are trying to do in ohio understand this is what's going on throughout the country
[03:15:33.240 --> 03:15:40.920]  we just had marco rubio acquired by billionaire paul singer for an undisclosed amount so far as
[03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:47.480]  the new yorker put it he bought rubio's first four-year contract with an option for an additional
[03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:52.920]  four years that's the way these guys roll and i want you to think about how paul singer gets his
[03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:58.200]  money because this is the kind of guy these are the kind of guys that are rolling the
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:05.320]  trans-pacific partnership out these are the guys that are working at a multinational level
[03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:13.720]  to establish corporate governance this is a guy who according to wikipedia has taken the state of
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:20.520]  peru in in 1996 he bought peruvian debt for 11 million dollars and then he escalated that
[03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:25.560]  uh adding interest charges and other fees till he got it up to 58 million when the
[03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:31.720]  dictator of peru tried to get out he confiscated his jet and said you can't leave the country
[03:16:31.720 --> 03:16:37.240]  until you pay me that's the that's the billionaire that's paul singer talking okay even worse with
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:43.240]  argentina what he did was he bought their debt for pennies on the dollar quite frankly about 10
[03:16:43.240 --> 03:16:48.520]  percent it was 630 million dollars worth of debt that his company bought for 48 million dollars
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:53.160]  that's less than 10 cents on the dollar and then what he did was he multiplied it with a crude
[03:16:53.160 --> 03:17:00.120]  interest of 2.3 billion so in other words what this guy's trying to do is get a 50 to one return
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:05.720]  on his investment 5001 as i pointed out last night you know we've all had seen these uh
[03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:10.680]  articles about the evil little hedge fund yuppie that bought that company raised the price of the
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:16.520]  pill from 1350 to uh i forget what the amount was but it's about a 5000 percent increase
[03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:20.920]  everybody said how can he get away with it well you can get away with it because of the fda
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:28.680]  because of its rules because it keeps competition out even for generic drugs whose patent has expired
[03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:32.360]  now subsequently we had another company come in and say they were going to make that drug available
[03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:37.160]  because it's being used now uh for AIDS patients they were going to make that drug available for
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:42.600]  one dollar a pill instead of the 1350 before the price increase the reason they can do that
[03:17:42.600 --> 03:17:49.320]  is because there's an exception to the fda rules that allows them to do that for AIDS
[03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:56.360]  they can bypass the regulations that typically would be used to create a monopoly so whether
[03:17:56.360 --> 03:18:00.840]  you're talking about the black market or on drugs or whether you're talking about the
[03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:04.920]  Ohio monopoly that they're trying to establish with this ballot access or whether you're trying
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:11.000]  to talk about the monopoly the de facto monopoly that is established by the regulatory agencies
[03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:16.040]  that serve the pharmaceutical companies it's called regulatory capture that's the way this
[03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:22.760]  thing works folks all of this boils down to billionaires seeking to own and control everything
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:28.600]  and here's this guy paul singer very active in republican politics he's a hardcore Zionist as
[03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:34.840]  well as promoting gay marriage and along with sheldon adelson another Zionist their main concern
[03:18:34.840 --> 03:18:39.480]  is where what's your position on israel they're far more concerned about the presidential
[03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:43.720]  candidates positions on israel than they are on protecting the united states
[03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:50.840]  and that's the guy that has picked marco rubio it's also rumored that he's won the sheldon
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:57.240]  adelson primary but that hasn't been made known yet but this is precisely the kind of control
[03:18:57.240 --> 03:19:01.960]  that we're going to be looking at once the trans pacific partnership the transatlantic
[03:19:01.960 --> 03:19:07.400]  partnerships are implemented through law and of course the other thing that's going to be coming
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:12.920]  to us is going to be this climate treaty that they're going to be working on in less than a month
[03:19:12.920 --> 03:19:17.880]  in paris and as we look at the corruption in the vatican remember that this was something
[03:19:17.880 --> 03:19:23.720]  they tried six years ago in 2009 in Copenhagen and they failed one of the reasons that they failed
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:28.680]  was because they hadn't brought china on board and many people were rightfully saying at the
[03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:32.360]  time you're talking about global warming but you're not going to do anything about china that has
[03:19:32.360 --> 03:19:38.760]  all of these probably the dirtiest power plant facilities and the most they're rapidly expanding
[03:19:38.760 --> 03:19:43.640]  these things exponentially in china they're burning very dirty you're not going to do anything to
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:48.920]  control china so this time they brought china on and instead of using people like prince charles
[03:19:48.920 --> 03:19:55.880]  as a mask as a beard they use the pope and they said this is a moral issue when we come back
[03:19:55.880 --> 03:20:00.200]  we're going to talk about the moral issue that the pope refuses to address we'll be right back
[03:20:00.200 --> 03:20:07.000]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:11.800]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we start
[03:20:11.800 --> 03:20:16.760]  with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage i'm

[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:32.360]  need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern there may come a time when you
[03:20:32.360 --> 03:20:37.240]  need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn

[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:32.680]  and the oxygen colon cleanser oxy powder that ends tomorrow now today what we found out is
[03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:42.920]  a vatican scandal that is breaking just as we are seeing the push towards a climate treaty
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:46.520]  that's coming up beginning the end of this month through about the first two weeks of december
[03:25:47.560 --> 03:25:54.120]  two new books are being are opening up this week uh depicting a vatican scandal with tales of
[03:25:54.120 --> 03:25:59.480]  mismanagement and greed that's the way the ap reports this such as sainthood causes that can
[03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:05.160]  cost half a million dollars understand that you can buy a sainthood it'll cost you half a million
[03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:11.640]  dollars and that has implications for what we saw with the pope's visit as well one mon senior
[03:26:11.640 --> 03:26:16.120]  allegedly broke down a wall of his next door neighbor who was a sick elderly priest so he
[03:26:16.120 --> 03:26:22.040]  could expand his already palatial apartment now this is the pope that lectures us on the evils
[03:26:22.040 --> 03:26:28.440]  of private property on the evils of the lack of compassion for the poor tells us that we have to
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:36.920]  get rid of the system of free markets of private property we have to embrace socialism yeah he
[03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:42.680]  can't manage his own house and yet he thinks that the global governance will be a solution no it's
[03:26:42.680 --> 03:26:46.840]  just going to be much much worse now what's going on with this as far as the sainthood they say the
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:57.480]  average price for beatification comes in at about $550,000 some have gone as high as 750,000 euros
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:04.440]  the causes of saintly candidates who don't inspire rich donors meanwhile can languish okay and that
[03:27:04.440 --> 03:27:10.200]  brings us back to what the pope did when he was here remember how he canonized a very controversial
[03:27:10.760 --> 03:27:20.040]  missionary out in california at the time archbishop jose gomez of la said that the canonization
[03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:25.240]  of this guy sarah the missionary was quote the most important dimension of the pope's visit to
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:30.680]  the united states he said this is a big story the first hispanic pope is coming to america to give
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:37.400]  us our first hispanic saint this is not a coincidence said the archbishop others who are
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:41.880]  native americans point out that these missions that he set up ended up killing about 90 of the
[03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:49.000]  california indians present at the time of the missionization and yet they did this yet they
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:56.120]  had a they made him into a saint even bypassing the usual requirements of reported two miracles
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:28:00.360]  the pope waived that requirement so the question i have and the question i had at the time and of
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:05.240]  course we know that there was a political agenda behind this we know that he was pushing open borders
[03:28:06.040 --> 03:28:11.560]  and he very explicitly did that with the canonization of that individual and i guess
[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:17.960]  since they're selling these beatifications i guess there may be some billionaires who wanted
[03:28:17.960 --> 03:28:22.680]  to see that happen we know they're billionaires like george soros who are pushing open borders
[03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:27.400]  maybe they would not be above buying a sainthood to make that case because they brought the pope
[03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:34.520]  here to make a moral case for global governance based on climate panic now one of the books that's
[03:28:34.520 --> 03:28:40.520]  coming out on thursday is called avarice avarice talking about the vatican it claims a foundation
[03:28:40.520 --> 03:28:46.280]  set up to support a children's hospital paid 200 000 euros towards a renovation of an apartment
[03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:53.720]  of the vaticans number two at the time carcisco bertone bertone came under fire last year over
[03:28:53.720 --> 03:28:59.000]  the apartment described to the book as a mega penthouse now he replies that he paid for this out
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:05.640]  of his own pocket the author of the book also said that nearly 400 000 euros donated in 2013 by
[03:29:05.640 --> 03:29:13.160]  church's worldwide to help the poor wound up in an off the books vatican account the books and this
[03:29:13.160 --> 03:29:19.080]  week's arrests because again the whistleblowers who expose this are now arrested just like in america
[03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:24.920]  even though it's one of the smaller governments you'll find the corruption doesn't change if they
[03:29:24.920 --> 03:29:31.560]  say it marks a new leak a phase in the battle leaks scandal which began back in 2012 if you remember
[03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:35.880]  there was a butler who was arrested for exposing information there stay with us we're going to be
[03:29:35.880 --> 03:29:41.800]  right back and we're going to look at the details of how they propose to enforce these carbon
[03:29:41.800 --> 03:29:46.600]  limitations on us they've already got the structure proposed in the draft document we'll read you

[03:33:13.800 --> 03:33:17.240]  host and joining me in this segment is leanne macadam we're going to talk about what's coming
[03:33:17.240 --> 03:33:22.600]  up tonight on the nightly news as well as some breaking news i want to continue with what's
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:28.680]  going on in the Vatican because this is very very relevant this isn't catholic bashing many people
[03:33:28.680 --> 03:33:35.480]  who are catholic have asked why climate change is the number one priority of the Vatican many would
[03:33:35.480 --> 03:33:40.920]  say the only priority of the Vatican and at the same time he's preaching to us about the morality
[03:33:40.920 --> 03:33:46.280]  of climate change telling us that we need to change our economic systems we need to have
[03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:50.840]  everything politicized we need to make decisions politically about economics and about other
[03:33:50.840 --> 03:33:54.440]  things in other words socialism is what he's telling us folks in many different ways he's made
[03:33:54.440 --> 03:33:59.560]  that very very clear at the same time he's pushing socialism as a moral cause at the same time he's
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:06.600]  pushing global governance as a moral cause we have this massive scandal that's going on within
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:13.400]  his own beefdom within the Vatican within the small nation state he can't even control if he's not
[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:20.680]  a part of it he can't even control and manage the tiniest nation state and yet he thinks that global
[03:34:20.680 --> 03:34:26.040]  governance is a solution the moral solution to everything it's exactly the opposite of what the
[03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:31.480]  founders of this country and all of us understand is the real problem well let me just tell you
[03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:36.680]  some of the other issues that are part of this of course there's two people that were arrested today
[03:34:36.680 --> 03:34:42.280]  a senior priest and an advisor these are people who were brought in to take a look at the
[03:34:42.280 --> 03:34:48.440]  murky finances as they put it in Reuters for decades they were brought in to investigate the
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:54.280]  bank it's called the Institute for Works of Religion and also the administration of the
[03:34:54.280 --> 03:35:00.200]  patrimony of the Holy See the APSA which acted as its own financial powerhouse as something
[03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:04.760]  directly under the pope now they're being investigated for money laundering for insider
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:11.480]  trading for market manipulation do you think that this pope that the whistleblowers have alleged
[03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:16.600]  is selling the edifications in other words sainthood do you think the pope who is selling
[03:35:16.600 --> 03:35:21.480]  sainthood who is accused of money laundering insider trading market manipulation do you think
[03:35:21.480 --> 03:35:26.600]  that the Vatican could be making some money off of pushing this climate change deal because somebody
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:30.680]  is going to have to be paid we're going to have to pay our taxes to somebody some of it will go to a
[03:35:30.680 --> 03:35:36.280]  world government but most of this is going to be an indulgence that's paid to Al Gore and to others
[03:35:36.280 --> 03:35:42.760]  and perhaps the pope is edging his way in there to get a piece of that indulgence now one last
[03:35:42.760 --> 03:35:51.400]  example and then I'll get Leanne's comments on this from May 22nd 2000 to March 29th 2011
[03:35:52.120 --> 03:35:59.800]  so for 11 years a guy named Natino who served on the board of many Italian firms okay this is a guy
[03:35:59.800 --> 03:36:05.160]  a big guy in business he's on the board of directors of a lot of Italian companies
[03:36:05.160 --> 03:36:12.360]  but he volunteers as an usher as an usher in the papal palace and he winds up being the owner of
[03:36:12.360 --> 03:36:18.200]  one of these papal accounts the aps a portfolio 339 which consisted of four separate accounts
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:25.000]  and the report speaks of the quote dubious origin and dubious final destination of the money
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:31.640]  and the closing of portfolio 339 so they brought these investigations to Vatican's promoter of
[03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:36.120]  justice kind of like their inspector general I guess the investigators asked the prosecutor
[03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:40.360]  to look into possible money laundering insider trading and market manipulation yeah we should
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:45.640]  look into that when it comes to pushing a global governance and that's what they're going to be
[03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:52.520]  pushing at the Paris conference that's going to be beginning in November 30th and going for the
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:58.040]  first couple weeks of December this is something that is very very risky Leanne. Right getting ready
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:03.720]  to rumble over these carbon emission reductions now you talked about you're talking about the
[03:37:03.720 --> 03:37:08.440]  papal slush fund basically are we going to invest investigate Hillary Clinton's slush fund the same
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:15.880]  type of thing it's sort of the pay to play and we have the lead author at the IPCC he's environmental
[03:37:15.880 --> 03:37:22.200]  economist Richard toll based on his data here he's working with the IPCC which is of course you know
[03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:28.360]  part of the UN there saying 25 years of failed global warming policies have actually just made
[03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:34.600]  us poor so for most people it has affected us served to make most people a little poor but those
[03:37:34.600 --> 03:37:40.360]  who benefit are those in politically favored industries or with connections to powerful
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:45.240]  politicians oh yeah we're seeing it again here with the pope and now with this coming out he says
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:49.400]  the policies are failed but what really has failed are their predictions are their models they've had
[03:37:49.400 --> 03:37:54.200]  to go from man-made global warming to say well we've got climate change and I think people are to
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:58.600]  blame and now they've got what's the latest term that they've come up with you mentioned it earlier
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:03.320]  today apogenic climate disruption oh yeah well you know they're going to continue to come up with
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:07.640]  different of course that that's essentially they're calling it climate disruption but it's still
[03:38:07.640 --> 03:38:12.840]  man-made yeah exactly so what they've gone from global warming to climate change to climate
[03:38:12.840 --> 03:38:18.600]  disruption and coming up this this conference is going to be in Paris and they have just fired
[03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:23.560]  now the top French meteorologists this is a guy who is very well known he was a meteorologist on
[03:38:23.560 --> 03:38:28.520]  their their biggest television station the biggest french television station and he came out in
[03:38:28.520 --> 03:38:38.600]  reaction writing a book against climate alarmism because one of the french ministers had brought
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:43.320]  all the weathermen together the meteorologists and said I want you to push this climate change
[03:38:43.320 --> 03:38:47.960]  narrative and he thought that was outrageous and it is but we saw the same thing when Rob Jacobson
[03:38:47.960 --> 03:38:53.240]  and I went to the American Meteorological Society meeting in Austin a year or two ago there was a
[03:38:53.240 --> 03:38:58.120]  George Soros organization that's how they got their funding pushing the weathermen saying you
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:04.600]  are the people who can change public opinion about this it's like show me the science right don't lock
[03:39:04.600 --> 03:39:09.960]  up your data I was part of a group that tried to get the raw data that Michael Mann and others
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:14.280]  were using he was the guy that created the hockey stick that Al Gore used to such a great effect
[03:39:14.280 --> 03:39:18.840]  we said show us the data you only show us your conclusions we want to see your raw data no no
[03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:24.920]  no they they sued they fought it in court they fought it in the all the way through the Virginia
[03:39:24.920 --> 03:39:31.160]  court system they won't even show you the raw data but we now have seen that NASA has come out
[03:39:31.160 --> 03:39:36.120]  and said oh the ice caps are actually growing yeah you see more ice melting and releasing around
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:42.760]  the edges but in other parts of the Antarctica you've had such an increase that it's a net increase
[03:39:42.760 --> 03:39:47.560]  it's not a net decrease and they and they were trying to spend the data again by looking at one
[03:39:47.560 --> 03:39:53.480]  area and by saying this is snowfall it's not ice and NASA came back and said no snowfall has been
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:58.680]  way below average this is ice growth here so on and on and on you can take the information
[03:39:58.680 --> 03:40:04.440]  and you can continue to spin it to spin it to try to create alarmism so that the you can pass your
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:09.880]  end goal which is global control global governance do you think at some point they're going to realize
[03:40:09.880 --> 03:40:14.600]  that with the internet they can't continue lying to us they're going to have to start dealing in
[03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:20.120]  truth or I mean is that just a big push to control the that's a good point and I don't really know
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:23.400]  where this is going to be put there's a lot of people who aren't buying the narrative and that's
[03:40:23.400 --> 03:40:27.240]  why they're concerned that's why they want the meteorologists and that's why they they fired
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:32.520]  the top meteorologist in France is because they're trying to push this on public opinion
[03:40:32.520 --> 03:40:37.080]  but let me read to you the statement from six years ago at Copenhagen and this is the guy
[03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:43.800]  the scientist uh Schellenhooper who is the principal advisor to the pope he is the common
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:49.480]  thread with all this he was part of the earth league that Prince Charles put together he's
[03:40:49.480 --> 03:40:53.880]  on the Vatican scientific advisory board he wrote the encyclical earlier this year during
[03:40:53.880 --> 03:40:59.560]  the summer for the pope but he said back in Copenhagen uh 2009 he said let me conclude
[03:40:59.560 --> 03:41:03.960]  with a daydream about key institutions that could bring about a sophisticated version of the
[03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:09.160]  conventional quote-unquote world government notion so he's self-revelant you know he's talked about
[03:41:09.160 --> 03:41:13.960]  this is world government he said we could do it with an earth constitution a global council
[03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:18.520]  and a planetary court I can't discuss these institutions in any detail here but I'll get
[03:41:18.520 --> 03:41:23.640]  to them later well now we know what those details are right because new american broke the story
[03:41:23.640 --> 03:41:27.640]  this last weekend there's a draft out there of this agreement that they're going to have
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:31.400]  and they pointed out that there's going to be they're calling for an international tribunal
[03:41:31.400 --> 03:41:38.200]  of climate justice there's two options one of them will be very rigid uh compliance enforcement
[03:41:38.200 --> 03:41:42.200]  and then the other one will be less rigid but the one that's less rigid doesn't really have any
[03:41:42.200 --> 03:41:46.200]  details in it the one that's going to be very rigid looks like that's what they're going to go with
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:50.680]  because that's the one that they've come up with details on if you look at the option that is just
[03:41:50.680 --> 03:41:54.760]  kind of what we're going to advise and pressure people they say well that committee shall consist
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:59.320]  of x number of members they don't even know but if you go down and look at the one that is going
[03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:04.840]  to have a compliance mechanism option number two they have it they say it's going to be 12 members
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:10.200]  we're going to break up the world into this many different regions we're going to have a two-thirds
[03:42:10.200 --> 03:42:15.080]  majority that's going to do this and here's the key leon not only have they broken this down and
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:19.400]  saying they're going to have a 12 member panel that is going to dictate to people and make them
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:26.360]  comply with this but the developed countries will have an enforcement branch but the developing
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:31.320]  countries the smaller countries will have a facilitative branch so we're going to get the iron
[03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:35.880]  fist but the smaller countries will get a facilitative branch and they will get subsidies
[03:42:35.880 --> 03:42:39.320]  from us so not only are they going to shut down our industry not only are they going to make our
[03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:44.600]  energy costs more expensive to where we're going to have pensioners like they do now in Germany
[03:42:44.600 --> 03:42:48.120]  who are dying from the cold because they can't afford to heat their house and not only are they
[03:42:48.120 --> 03:42:54.200]  going to destroy the quality of life for us but they are going to make us subsidize this for the
[03:42:54.200 --> 03:43:00.280]  smaller countries and they're going to make sure these smaller countries are well well represented
[03:43:00.280 --> 03:43:05.160]  and these 12 members that's the way this thing is going to break down i mean this sounds completely
[03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:11.240]  psychopathic who comes up with these ideas and then you have these successful countries like
[03:43:11.240 --> 03:43:16.040]  germany or sweden or other places now being infiltrated with this huge mass migration crisis
[03:43:16.600 --> 03:43:21.320]  so you were an example of a successful country and now we're going to destroy you because it's
[03:43:21.320 --> 03:43:26.840]  the only that this plan can take place they're blaming it on climate change of course uh over
[03:43:26.840 --> 03:43:32.920]  looking the george soros influence and other globalists who aren't destabilizing these regions
[03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:35.880]  but blaming it on climate change that that's what's going to continue this
[03:43:36.440 --> 03:43:43.160]  massive influx but it it is part of this huge plan well if you look at every legislative agenda
[03:43:43.160 --> 03:43:47.560]  that's coming out right now whether it's these trade treaties or whether it's this climate treaty
[03:43:47.560 --> 03:43:54.600]  they are all looking at globalization they're all looking at getting rid of borders getting
[03:43:54.600 --> 03:43:59.640]  rid of culture in the name of multiculturalism taking our property in the name of compassion
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:04.600]  and they're coming up with these compliance mechanisms that are going to transfer wealth
[03:44:04.600 --> 03:44:09.480]  at the national level but then they're using the open border situation to transfer wealth
[03:44:09.480 --> 03:44:14.920]  at the local level to kick people out of their homes while they create refugee areas for the
[03:44:14.920 --> 03:44:20.760]  people that they're bringing in so everywhere you look at this they are setting up not only the
[03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:27.400]  transnational mechanisms to do this but they've got corporations who are going to be insinuating
[03:44:27.400 --> 03:44:31.640]  themselves when they talk about this trade agreement they're talking about nations and
[03:44:31.640 --> 03:44:36.760]  stakeholders when they talk about nations and stakeholders they're talking about the big
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:41.640]  billionaires who are going to be making the money off of this right that that's there's no reason
[03:44:41.640 --> 03:44:46.440]  and of course we're not stakeholders in this we don't have a stake in the future if this stuff
[03:44:46.440 --> 03:44:50.600]  goes through this is something that's going to be run by the billionaires just as we see with
[03:44:50.600 --> 03:44:53.480]  these trade partnerships everybody was concerned one of the things they were concerned about was
[03:44:54.280 --> 03:44:57.560]  they were going to own everything set up a monopoly on everything by extending their
[03:44:57.560 --> 03:45:03.880]  patents and they were going to have a transnational group that was going to be at the level or above
[03:45:03.880 --> 03:45:07.320]  the nations and I would say that they're already above the nations if they can dictate
[03:45:07.320 --> 03:45:11.320]  to the legislatures like they've done here in America you can't talk about this trade agreement
[03:45:11.320 --> 03:45:16.680]  here we are yesterday was four weeks since they finished the trans-pacific partnership we were
[03:45:16.680 --> 03:45:21.000]  told by paul ryanow that we couldn't see that until they got it finished because they were
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:25.320]  negotiating it well show us where it is we know they're going to hold this until the holidays
[03:45:25.320 --> 03:45:28.920]  and they're probably going to ram this through when everybody black friday or exactly everybody's
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:33.480]  going to be be happy you know they're going to be doing their christmas and their new year's
[03:45:33.480 --> 03:45:36.920]  stuff and they're going to ram it through like they did the federal reserve on us because this
[03:45:36.920 --> 03:45:41.720]  is the next level right and they must be planning something really big because in 2016 they're
[03:45:41.720 --> 03:45:46.120]  planning for an extra long summer break and we know how they love to ram things through and
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:50.920]  then take a nice long break oh yeah to let the dust settle after they so we we know 2016 is
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:56.440]  definitely going to be a very big year but i mean you were pointing out yesterday just the size of
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:46:02.280]  the government in 2004 if we just backed it up and went back there how we could solve our debt
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:05.800]  problem that was something harry brown did very effectively the two times he ran for president's
[03:46:05.800 --> 03:46:11.320]  libertarian candidate he said what is he what does the personal income tax contribute percentage wise
[03:46:11.320 --> 03:46:18.040]  to the revenue stream well today that's about 36 percent and harry's insight was to say what if
[03:46:18.680 --> 03:46:24.520]  we got rid of the income tax what if we got rid of the irs as far as personal income tax goes just
[03:46:24.520 --> 03:46:32.040]  have a zero flat tax okay nobody pays any tax how far back would you have to cut government
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:37.320]  in order to not increase the deficit any faster than we're doing each time and the answer is
[03:46:37.320 --> 03:46:42.440]  today you would have to go back to 2004 could we live with the government it was the size it was
[03:46:42.440 --> 03:46:49.640]  in 2004 to get rid of the income tax completely to have a zero tax rate for all of us i think we
[03:46:49.640 --> 03:46:55.400]  could yeah and we see how overgrown the government has become and largely incompetent the larger
[03:46:55.400 --> 03:47:01.800]  that it grows and yet this is the plan to rule the entire world yeah in this way and it's a failure
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:07.720]  and it's a corporate plan it is corporate cronyism at the global level and and that's what's so
[03:47:07.720 --> 03:47:12.200]  worrying about this and they're about to ram through all of these treaties and they may treat
[03:47:12.200 --> 03:47:17.480]  treat this paris situation as a fast track for the treaties as well when they ran through the
[03:47:17.480 --> 03:47:22.280]  procedure for trade promotion authority that really opened the door to a lot of things besides
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:28.600]  just the tpp and the ttip and it does it for six years very very dangerous times that we're living
[03:47:28.600 --> 03:47:35.080]  in things could be changed incredibly quickly and they could reorder society on an international
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:39.400]  level just like that absolutely that's what they're about to do i i know one of the big things as
[03:47:39.400 --> 03:47:43.800]  well i was reading this morning just about how the apple pay how this is going to be something huge
[03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:49.240]  is going to completely alter the way that people use cash and and money and everything we will no
[03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:53.800]  longer need credit cards so as all the poor credit card companies they're going to go out of business
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:58.520]  here with this apple pay and then you know google and these others but of course it's going to same
[03:47:58.520 --> 03:48:04.680]  people running it yeah and it's going to come away from our telephones to of course the implantable
[03:48:04.680 --> 03:48:09.640]  chips that'll be next because you know you won't lose those implantable chips and so it is all just
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:15.480]  apart step by step moving us closer to the global governance and being able to be controlled and
[03:48:15.480 --> 03:48:21.160]  contained in these borderless world which is of course the wonderful all the kids now that are
[03:48:21.160 --> 03:48:26.120]  being indoctrinated with socialism they really are pushing for this borderless world because
[03:48:26.120 --> 03:48:29.960]  on the one hand yeah we should all be free we shouldn't be told where we can go and where we
[03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:35.960]  can't go but that's not the agenda of the the rulers it's not for us all to be free to go where
[03:48:35.960 --> 03:48:41.400]  we want we talk about their their global agenda again it's not just this climate treaty that's
[03:48:41.400 --> 03:48:44.920]  about to come up in less than a month but it's also what they did back in september about the
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:50.040]  time when the pope was here and that was when they passed the 2030 agenda at the un michael
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:54.760]  snider had a great article yesterday breaking down one of the details on that because it's a very
[03:48:54.760 --> 03:48:59.240]  large document there's a lot of bureaucratic doublespeak and you know the way they do this
[03:48:59.240 --> 03:49:05.480]  is the last person awake wins because they try to put you to sleep reading these documents they're
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:10.440]  very dense they're very thick they got a lot of bureaus cratics talk in it but what he did was he
[03:49:10.440 --> 03:49:18.600]  went down to the section 16.9 one of their goals by 2030 provide legal identity for everyone including
[03:49:18.600 --> 03:49:23.640]  birth registration globally and he points out that they've already selected the UN has already selected
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:28.680]  a place where they're going to store all of this in geneva switzerland they've selected a vendor
[03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:32.920]  who is going to do all this and this is what i thought was also very interestingly and because
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:39.000]  it shows again yet again how this is all tied together this isn't our conspiracy theory connecting
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:43.160]  the dots that the open borders are connected with global governance and everything they
[03:49:43.160 --> 03:49:48.760]  tied this together you know while they're justifying getting biometric data on everyone
[03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:54.200]  from birth and storing it for the united nations in geneva switzerland it's the united
[03:49:54.200 --> 03:50:00.360]  nations high commissioner for refugees it's because of the refugees we need to have this
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:04.520]  yeah we need to track these people and we've already got them disappearing in germany so
[03:50:04.520 --> 03:50:09.240]  all of this stuff is tied together it's the globalist agenda and now they have
[03:50:09.240 --> 03:50:14.280]  have opened it up overtly it's been covert in many ways but we could see what their broad
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:21.160]  goals were but now we're seeing the detailed plans we've got names places concrete goals
[03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:26.840]  timeframes everything is there we just have to get the public to wake up to what's going on
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:31.800]  before this is too late yeah and it absolutely is pushing that way you know to where it is
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:35.560]  going to be too late people do need to wake up when we get back we'll talk a little bit about
[03:50:35.560 --> 03:50:39.800]  this model quitting instagram yeah but more people need to do this yeah let's talk about
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:45.800]  that we'll also talk about donald trump i actually like his va program this is something that is
[03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:49.080]  very simple it's something that would work that's one of the good things that can come out of

[03:54:09.640 --> 03:54:13.400]  welcome back to the alex joe show i'm david knight and joining me now is leanne macadoo
[03:54:13.400 --> 03:54:18.120]  we've been talking about what's going on in the vatican the move to create a world government
[03:54:18.120 --> 03:54:23.480]  based on climate alarmism leon is going to break down for us what we're going to be talking about
[03:54:23.480 --> 03:54:28.120]  what she's going to be covering tonight on the nightly news as well as what a caller was referring
[03:54:28.120 --> 03:54:33.080]  to earlier about the model who quit uh was it instagram was that uh basically her whole social
[03:54:33.080 --> 03:54:39.000]  media existence she just decided she let all of her uh followers know she had nearly a million
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:42.680]  people following her on different social platforms and she was letting everyone know
[03:54:42.680 --> 03:54:50.040]  that her life as an online insta celebrity was dishonest contrived and she wanted she wants
[03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:54.840]  young people to disconnect and stop constantly being absorbed by this digital media because
[03:54:54.840 --> 03:55:00.440]  it's fake and she was just explaining she spent 50 hours a week just putting on clothes just because
[03:55:00.440 --> 03:55:05.000]  she gets paid for it and spending you know taking hundreds of selfies just to get that
[03:55:05.000 --> 03:55:10.280]  perfect thing to make you feel like oh i want to be her her life is so perfect and she just
[03:55:10.280 --> 03:55:15.960]  was feeling really empty and uh i mean this is important because young people are getting
[03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:20.840]  plastic surgery so they can look good in their selfies on instagram something that doesn't even
[03:55:20.840 --> 03:55:25.640]  well because they're living in a plastic existence right it's completely unreal it's totally fake
[03:55:26.200 --> 03:55:33.480]  and a new a new survey found that teens age 13 to 18 spend more uh than nine hours a day
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:39.160]  on social media and their different um entertainment media and so i mean these are these are kids
[03:55:39.160 --> 03:55:43.160]  are now 13 to 18 and then they're going to go out and vote yeah so their their whole life they've
[03:55:43.160 --> 03:55:48.920]  been absorbed into a completely false version of reality and then we're asking them to go and
[03:55:48.920 --> 03:55:54.920]  no wonder that they'll vote for a socialist communist i mean it's very concerning as you
[03:55:54.920 --> 03:56:00.680]  mentioned their judgment but also very sad for them as individuals so they don't have a a relationship
[03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:06.840]  with people right one-to-one relationship these these social media relationships are not real
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:12.360]  relationships folks there's something that is much much richer out there for you i want to talk
[03:56:12.360 --> 03:56:16.760]  real quickly get your take on this lee and i saw a couple of things come out from donald trump over
[03:56:16.760 --> 03:56:22.680]  the weekend that were pretty amazing one of them was he lays out a plan to reform the va he said he
[03:56:22.680 --> 03:56:27.320]  would institute policies that would see the veterans affairs the va facilities competing
[03:56:27.320 --> 03:56:32.360]  with non-va hospitals he said that under his plan any veteran could go to a doctor that accepts
[03:56:32.360 --> 03:56:38.840]  medicare or receives care i mean that's a very very simple way to fix this problem it's called
[03:56:38.840 --> 03:56:44.600]  competition and choice he says i'm not going to get rid of the va i just want to supplement it
[03:56:44.600 --> 03:56:49.240]  and if they are going to make people wait inordinate amount of times for health care
[03:56:49.240 --> 03:56:53.640]  then then fine let let people take these government vouchers the government is paying
[03:56:53.640 --> 03:56:59.000]  forward anyway just honor the contract that you created with the veterans for health care just
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:03.720]  honor your contracts and once we get them to honor their contracts that they created to the veterans
[03:57:03.720 --> 03:57:07.160]  maybe we can move to the next step get them to honor the contract they have with all of us the
[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:11.560]  bill of rights the constitution that sort of thing exactly well and i also like how he continues
[03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:16.600]  to point out how the tv networks shouldn't be raking in all the dough from these contrived
[03:57:16.600 --> 03:57:23.080]  debates that they should be putting some money back into the va uh true i mean these are the ones
[03:57:23.080 --> 03:57:26.760]  that are protecting their freedom of speech i think it highlights that there are some very very
[03:57:26.760 --> 03:57:30.200]  simple solutions that are out there i know when the pope was here one of the things that they did
[03:57:30.200 --> 03:57:33.880]  with that stage we know that was staged with that little kid who gets through all the tight
[03:57:33.880 --> 03:57:37.720]  security because let me tell you that security was tight you don't get in there unless somebody
[03:57:37.720 --> 03:57:41.880]  lets you so they push this little kid forward and he goes up and gets a kiss or something from the
[03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:47.480]  pope and they wanted to talk about the dreamers parental the dapa instead of the daca there's
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:51.960]  a dreamers program for the children there's also one for the parents and they said well we want
[03:57:51.960 --> 03:57:57.160]  obama to extend this you have to understand all this amnesty stuff is being done by executive order
[03:57:57.160 --> 03:58:00.360]  right and all these people pushing back on trump saying well we're not going to do this we're not
[03:58:00.360 --> 03:58:04.360]  going to do that he would have and any other president would have the ability to do that
[03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:09.720]  and just shut that down by revoking those executive orders well that's it for today's
[03:58:09.720 --> 03:58:14.520]  show join us tonight at seven central for the nightly news lienne macadoo will be hosting
