[00:00.000 --> 00:25.800]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline
[00:25.800 --> 00:33.440]  against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere every day Jones admits he's an actor or Tucker
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.720]  Carlson says nobody would take me seriously where do we say that we never said that they
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.720]  just say we said that but where's the clip what where's the article what where do we
[00:44.720 --> 00:51.600]  say that doesn't exist Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist Jones
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.240]  is playing a character on his radio show the radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act
[00:58.240 --> 01:04.560]  he's actually a performance artist he's a performance artist Alex Jones is a fake they're
[01:04.560 --> 01:12.280]  lying to you because they think you're stupid and it's all based on custody battle max wife five
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.160]  years ago and she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before like
[01:17.160 --> 01:22.800]  the Joker being sarcastic saying take your pros at kids take your illegal drugs to you'll die
[01:22.800 --> 01:28.560]  it's fun so people wouldn't take drugs and they wanted to enter that in evidence they look he's
[01:28.560 --> 01:34.200]  insane telling kids to use drugs and my lawyer went when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the
[01:34.200 --> 01:41.800]  Joker no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson so yeah when I've been Cobra commander or Optimus
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.560]  Prime auto bonds let's roll or the Joker because I can do imitations of them all really good or
[01:47.560 --> 01:53.760]  Darth Vader don't act so surprised globalist you didn't think you could silence the American
[01:53.760 --> 02:00.920]  people did you do I really think I'm Darth Vader no I think I'm Optimus Prime over commander
[02:00.920 --> 02:07.480]  the Joker no and clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what
[02:07.480 --> 02:12.800]  I'm saying is what I really think no one believes the Babylon be it's not trying to lie to you
[02:12.800 --> 02:19.000]  it's being sarcastic by the vaccinate me on model today it's required by the CDC but they play
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.520]  those games and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to even though I tell people
[02:24.520 --> 02:31.280]  okay this is a joke this isn't serious they clip it out and they say no this is what he really
[02:31.280 --> 02:37.920]  believes every day when I leave work I do this and they go look he admitted in court he's an
[02:37.920 --> 02:44.640]  actor well yeah I'm was an actor in scanner darkly I was an actor in waking life I was an actor when
[02:44.640 --> 02:52.400]  I was Cobra commander but it doesn't mean that Alex Jones the talk show host up here reading news
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.120]  articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying and you know that
[02:57.120 --> 03:03.040]  you're insulted right now I'm even explaining that to you and so am I but that's who these
[03:03.040 --> 03:12.920]  people are you don't know the power of the dark side am I really Darth Vader make Alex Jones
[03:12.920 --> 03:27.600]  really talented he's smart he's funny as hell it's truly funny I'm kind of retarded now that
[03:27.600 --> 03:34.120]  I've done those imitations those little jokes you now not listen to what I say about other
[03:34.120 --> 03:39.560]  things when I show you a powerful news article by dr. Joseph McCullough on info wars calm
[03:39.560 --> 03:45.240]  it has all the cited information the latest tragedy sudden adult death syndrome no that's
[03:45.240 --> 03:51.440]  a real thing that's something happening in the real world and that's what we're breaking down here
[03:51.440 --> 03:59.040]  today I am Alex Jones and I am the guy on this show every day I am an American and that's what
[03:59.040 --> 04:15.640]  I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand Pesky earth creatures
[04:15.640 --> 04:32.400]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[04:32.400 --> 04:39.680]  gonna happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the
[04:39.680 --> 05:03.840]  front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones vitamin mineral fusion is your one stop shop
[05:03.840 --> 05:09.720]  for health for longevity for a boosted immune system and the climate we live in today and what
[05:09.720 --> 05:14.120]  the globalists are up to I think anybody not taking a high quality product like this is
[05:14.120 --> 05:19.120]  insane and there's other great vitamin mineral amino acid you'll complete products out there
[05:19.120 --> 05:24.920]  ours is amongst the very best and it is a lower cost than many leading brands but whatever you do
[05:24.920 --> 05:31.080]  take a high quality multi vitamin mineral amino acid system like this it's liquid that you put
[05:31.080 --> 05:36.320]  in water because you have a better absorption rate when you do that now vitamin mineral fusion is
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.840]  our overall best-selling product it finally came in a month ago and we've almost sold out of the

[06:15.360 --> 06:20.160]  good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Alex Jones show I am Harrison Smith sitting in
[06:20.160 --> 06:25.040]  for Alex but not really actually I'll just be here for the first hour really just setting up what
[06:25.040 --> 06:29.520]  you're about to see this is an interview that Alex Jones had with Steve Bannon yesterday on
[06:29.520 --> 06:34.760]  Steve Bannon show the war room pandemic and it's an extensive interview about an hour long
[06:34.760 --> 06:38.960]  we're gonna fill up the first hour with it where they talked about all sorts of topics but primarily
[06:38.960 --> 06:44.400]  transhumanism which of course you can find all about in the great reset in the war for the world
[06:44.400 --> 06:50.720]  the new book by Alex Jones so without any further ado here it is the interview from yesterday with
[06:50.720 --> 06:57.240]  Steve Bannon and Alex Jones let's watch the next 71 days we're gonna see some very violent fireworks
[06:57.240 --> 07:07.840]  I would predict racially motivated mass shootings bombings poisonings attacks on power supplies
[07:07.840 --> 07:14.880]  being blamed on the right wing they intend to bring in a full dictatorship in the next 71 days
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.940]  and we are all strapped to this thing this is such a dangerous time and I would advise the
[07:20.940 --> 07:27.440]  globalist who are mid-level that think they're about to have a leftist revolution the globalists
[07:27.440 --> 07:30.960]  don't actually plan the higher levels to have that they plan on having a civil war that brings
[07:30.960 --> 07:38.160]  down America and you'll be the fall guy okay welcome back we got Alex Jones the release of
[07:38.160 --> 07:43.740]  the book is today the great reset and the war for the world it's a it's a blockbuster everybody's
[07:43.740 --> 07:49.840]  got to get it but I want to get in first Alex these comments yesterday let's talk about them
[07:49.840 --> 07:55.240]  for a second because it's got everybody obviously their heads blowing up we got now 70 days or
[07:55.240 --> 08:01.280]  70 days to go you know we've got momentum they're trying to suppress it with suppression poles
[08:01.280 --> 08:05.960]  they're sitting there going you know you guys are not gonna have a writ tsunami what is your
[08:05.960 --> 08:10.400]  theory of the case here because you're a smart guy do you do you really believe that they're
[08:10.400 --> 08:15.360]  going to try to pull out all stops in this regard or does that hurt us playing into that
[08:15.360 --> 08:19.040]  narrative walk us through because I know you're trying to accomplish exactly what we're trying
[08:19.040 --> 08:23.640]  to accomplish which is to take the country back and to make sure we take it we do the house in
[08:23.640 --> 08:27.520]  the Senate and then we get you know I don't know if Trump back in or not I know that you've got
[08:27.520 --> 08:32.000]  some some very definitive of thoughts about that but we got to win the house we got to win
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.640]  the Senate we have to win these school boards we have to win these state legislatures so walk
[08:35.640 --> 08:41.640]  us through your theory of the case because we only got a 42nd clip on you from yesterday and I
[08:41.640 --> 08:46.160]  apologize I know you requested a full clip I've spent basically an hour on that my third hour
[08:46.160 --> 08:53.040]  yesterday in context I said that is something that is in their deck of cards it's the race of
[08:53.040 --> 08:58.600]  spades is a provocateur a false flag attack or something like we saw with the staged Whitmer
[08:58.600 --> 09:05.240]  kidnapping situation a few years ago with the same FBI group then going and running the provocaturing
[09:05.240 --> 09:12.400]  on January 6 the same FBI group running the fake Russian dossier and the same special FBI unit
[09:12.400 --> 09:19.520]  now raiding Marlago a few weeks ago so we see the pre-programming of puppet Biden the third
[09:19.520 --> 09:25.400]  administration of Obama in June of last year putting out a new national terrorism directive
[09:25.400 --> 09:33.840]  saying questioning election fraud questioning election results or questioning lockdowns or
[09:33.840 --> 09:40.360]  forced inoculation is terrorism or questioning critical race theory that's officially in that
[09:40.360 --> 09:44.160]  national plan and then we've seen them roll that out we've seen the FBI say the number one
[09:44.160 --> 09:49.560]  terror threat is domestic right wingers they've now defined it as fascism if you support President
[09:49.560 --> 09:54.120]  Trump or America first and then now we start seeing headlines in the top of drugs yesterday
[09:54.120 --> 10:00.560]  you know imminent Trump's calling for violence Trump's Trump's calling for insurrection January
[10:00.560 --> 10:09.120]  6 2.0 it's that's been all over the news building up and Biden came out on Friday and said I believe
[10:09.120 --> 10:16.000]  that Republicans are going to be violent in the next 74 days well now yesterday was 71 days now
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.120]  we're 70 days out and if you look at all the pre-programming data points that are there they're
[10:22.120 --> 10:29.640]  hyping this up and with their long history of sir hand sir hand being a patsy and all the other
[10:29.640 --> 10:35.680]  events we've seen where the FBI goes out and actually creates these terror groups that is what
[10:35.680 --> 10:40.320]  I would do if I was them and we know Bill Clinton on Air Force One in front of the huge
[10:40.320 --> 10:48.600]  press corps right after he won reelection in 2000 in 1996 excuse me said he owed his reelection
[10:48.600 --> 10:54.000]  when he was 10 points behind to the Oklahoma City bombing and so they can use these type of
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.400]  tragic events as a pretext to demonize and try to basically outlaw their opposition that's why
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.960]  he's calling Republicans semi-fascist claiming that if we don't want dead people and illegal
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.440]  aliens voting or all these electronic voting machines or Ellen ballots that we're somehow
[11:11.440 --> 11:17.120]  fascist when they're the ones that are censoring and suppressing and raiding their political
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.440]  enemies we now know the FBI admits Mark Zuckerberg told the truth last week on Joe Rogan when he
[11:23.440 --> 11:30.080]  said the FBI came to us and said do not have this story it is election meddling but it was a real
[11:30.080 --> 11:35.160]  story they were election meddling so they know there's a giant political realignment against
[11:35.160 --> 11:40.920]  globalism neoliberalism around the world and really the epicenter is the United States in
[11:40.920 --> 11:45.880]  places like Brazil with Bolsonaro and they know they're losing support with the yellow vest and
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.920]  all these other movements and so they know that austerity and the great reset that as you pointed
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.920]  out is an irreversible collapse if it goes much further is unpopular they're taking the gloves off
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.440]  and going to a pure authoritarian model and I believe in the next 70 days it is their main
[12:02.440 --> 12:08.520]  move and again they pre-programmed it pre-rolled it out pre-advertised it to provocateur or stage
[12:08.520 --> 12:14.880]  some very serious massive events it might be a new war it it it might be oh hackers took down
[12:14.880 --> 12:22.040]  a part of the power grid it might not be a mass shooting it might not be a bombing but something
[12:22.040 --> 12:27.560]  big is gonna happen we're gonna have a gigantic October surprise what do you think how do you
[12:27.560 --> 12:34.480]  let's put Biden's address to the nation I don't know if the broadcast it doesn't seem to be to
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.120]  be newsworthy because it's purely political what do you expect out of him and how does that fit
[12:39.120 --> 12:44.400]  into your theory of the case when he's calling this is worse than Hillary Clinton calling us the
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.640]  deplorables I mean right now I would argue that two-thirds of the nation back our policies when
[12:49.640 --> 12:55.200]  we talk about inflation immigration crime wokeness in schools the economy on our side of the foot
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.240]  this is Ron Brownstein on our side of football versus theirs climate change you know whatever
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.760]  this whatever they're they're this thing of democracy because we got more votes than they
[13:04.760 --> 13:11.600]  have and and abortion is bronzing saying that's what's going to motivate them put in your theory
[13:11.600 --> 13:17.600]  the case where does where does Joe Biden's they're all fascist or semi-fascist fit in and what do
[13:17.600 --> 13:24.800]  you anticipate he's gonna tell the nation on Thursday night well absolutely what you just
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.760]  said is what he's gonna say he's going to say the republicans want to take your vote the republicans
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.800]  want to take your right to kill children the republicans are evil they're bad and basically
[13:34.800 --> 13:40.320]  demonize the republican party pop down because the populist realignment happened through the
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.920]  republican party not the democratic party and so he's going to try to basically expand this idea
[13:45.920 --> 13:51.280]  of beginning to outlaw the political opposition and democrats have been talking about outlawing
[13:51.280 --> 13:59.680]  the republican party we see them going around the country with gozer and with green and with
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.280]  countless other races we're right here in texas with members of congress the democrats are trying
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.960]  in court cases to bar multiple current members of congress and people running from congress
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.440]  to be able to not run because they questioned the the 2020 election and so they're trying to outlaw
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.200]  people running for office or being reelected to question election fraud well we we send the
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.240]  state department around the world to try to make sure elections are free and fair and if you measure
[14:30.240 --> 14:35.680]  up us elections the two elections in the third world that they say are fraudulent we're way fraudulent
[14:35.680 --> 14:41.360]  than them by every yardstick so they're trying to outlaw questioning elections and barring people
[14:41.360 --> 14:47.440]  from running that's the greatest form of blocking the electoral process and blocking voters will
[14:47.440 --> 14:52.640]  and then turning around he's going to have an address and say that the republicans are fascist
[14:52.640 --> 14:57.680]  they don't want dead people and illegal aliens voting and and they don't want mail-in ballots the
[14:57.680 --> 15:03.840]  same way we know they stole the 2020 election so it's going to be a declaration of war an expansion
[15:03.840 --> 15:09.520]  of the ongoing declaration of war not just against america's energy not just our borders not just our
[15:09.520 --> 15:15.440]  sovereignty not just our currency not just the the value of our dollar but a further declaration of
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.400]  war against anyone questioning any of their fraudulent narratives that are collapsing
[15:21.280 --> 15:24.800]  look i want to talk about i'm gonna get the fb and a second i want to talk about these executive
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.840]  orders that you bring up the one about the voting and the the the previous one do you believe that
[15:29.840 --> 15:35.600]  republican attorney generals and the republican party elected officials have done enough to expose
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.320]  what those executive orders were what they really say and to combat them even at a state
[15:40.320 --> 15:46.720]  attorney general level to contest what these executive orders are well it's like you said a
[15:46.720 --> 15:52.480]  few days ago our biggest problem is not even the democrats they're unpopular they're criminal
[15:52.480 --> 15:57.120]  they're disgusting but the republican leadership will not get on the ramparts will not defend the
[15:57.120 --> 16:05.600]  gates will not cover just look at these headlines from roiders world faces unprecedented global

[21:50.080 --> 21:55.680]  it is our biggest problem is not even the democrats they're unpopular they're criminal
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.320]  they're disgusting but the republican leadership will not get on the ramparts will not defend the
[22:00.320 --> 22:07.600]  gates will not cover any real issues they talk about uh you know small business stimulation
[22:07.600 --> 22:13.120]  packages that don't even pass and things that are not on people's radar they're not talking about
[22:13.120 --> 22:17.360]  inflation they're not even talking about human smuggling and open borders like they should
[22:17.360 --> 22:23.760]  they're not talking about election fraud they're not talking about any of the real things that
[22:23.760 --> 22:27.920]  concern americans they're not talking about the military still being forcibly inoculated or
[22:29.040 --> 22:33.440]  illegal aliens component by the millions and not even be given covid test or covid shots
[22:33.440 --> 22:37.600]  which i don't think they should give them covid shots but but then uh jokovich can't come here
[22:37.600 --> 22:44.960]  for the us open the republicans need to get on the offense but the republican rhino establishment
[22:44.960 --> 22:52.640]  is working with the democrat party establishment to fend off the populist peaceful political
[22:52.640 --> 22:58.640]  insurrection that has been taking the country and the world by storm they are fighting us
[22:59.200 --> 23:04.080]  they are attempting to bankrupt america to bring people to their knees in a giant cloud
[23:04.080 --> 23:10.160]  and privin great reset model so that we're so poor and so destitute we've got to accept
[23:10.160 --> 23:17.520]  a communist socialist model with a high tech technocracy global id global carbon tax global
[23:17.520 --> 23:23.440]  social credit score global universal basic income they're bringing down the old system
[23:23.440 --> 23:28.720]  that they've already sucked dry owes us the saviors as they bring in their new tyranny that's why
[23:28.720 --> 23:34.720]  the climate we're in it's not like five years ago or 30 years ago or 40 years ago it's closer to
[23:34.720 --> 23:39.600]  the climate we had during the the the civil war where there's major competing factions
[23:40.160 --> 23:44.880]  battling over control of this country and they want the populist faction out of the game
[23:44.880 --> 23:49.920]  basically outlawed and and labeled as terrorists it's not going to work though that's why i warned
[23:49.920 --> 23:55.040]  the establishment that they really need to study history and and look at what they've done and
[23:55.040 --> 24:00.480]  understand that drag queen story time and critical race theory has turned the country
[24:00.480 --> 24:05.760]  and really the world against them and that they they should sue for peace they should back down
[24:05.760 --> 24:10.640]  they should not try to accelerate us into a civil war but you see it all over the news civil war
[24:10.640 --> 24:14.400]  imminent we're gonna have a war with the republicans we're gonna have a war with the populist
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.400]  we're gonna arrest trump lindsay graham if you arrest trump there's gonna be a civil war there's
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.840]  gonna be war on the streets i don't if they do arrest trump i don't want war on the streets
[24:23.840 --> 24:29.200]  i want total political realignment to the next level and we should talk about peaceful ways
[24:29.200 --> 24:35.280]  to not let them steve that's a lot of tourists that into violence this is my point lindsay
[24:35.280 --> 24:40.320]  graham and these guys who are never with us for him to say that because right now the momentum
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.800]  is on our side everything they're trying to do from the suppression polls to divert the conversation
[24:44.800 --> 24:50.080]  over to civil war to all of this gets us off the target which is the target is november 8th
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.320]  in a sweeping we could break the democratic party as a national political institution
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.160]  from the school but you guys are seeing this in texas from the school and what disances
[24:58.160 --> 25:01.920]  have done in florida from the school boards all the way up to the state legislatures to the house
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.480]  in the senate they're trying to divert our attention what would you tell the people out there that
[25:06.480 --> 25:10.960]  follow you given the fact that they're going to use information warfare like they've never
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.440]  done before at your icor commander what is it we're going to get to the book in the next break
[25:15.440 --> 25:20.240]  but right now what should what should the people that follow alex jones and the people that say
[25:20.240 --> 25:25.920]  hey look this guy's smart and tough and he's one of our leaders what is your advice to the populist
[25:25.920 --> 25:33.520]  movement right now i would tell every person watching this to share this broadcast while it's
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.960]  live and and later when it's archived and i would have them send it to all of their liberal friends
[25:38.960 --> 25:43.760]  and left his friends and say how long are you going to be a chump how long are you going to be
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.960]  a fool uh even if you're unable to vote in this election because of changing over parties a lot
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.440]  of states can still do it you need to understand you're going to be bankrupt you're going to have
[25:53.440 --> 26:00.400]  no future if you don't wake up to the fact that some very criminal multinational corporations
[26:00.400 --> 26:05.600]  are using the democratic party to basically have a possible corporate takeover of this country then
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.760]  i would go out to every relative every friend every family every employee every boss every
[26:11.760 --> 26:18.320]  stranger and and i would tell them you need to go vote and you need to not just count
[26:18.320 --> 26:25.280]  on there being a red tsunami because there's going to be a blue election fraud firewall or or
[26:25.280 --> 26:30.160]  seawall that's going to try to block that but we know from the studies in places like texas and
[26:30.160 --> 26:35.840]  florida they run out of dead people and they run out of illegals on the ballot able to vote very
[26:35.840 --> 26:42.960]  very quickly and they hit a wall so we've got to counter them with absolute total and complete
[26:42.960 --> 26:47.840]  voting okay sure i think i reach a lot of voters being on air myself why do i need to go vote well
[26:47.840 --> 26:52.960]  because every vote counts and and even if you think your state's red it's not for long we have to
[26:52.960 --> 26:58.160]  crush them now everybody watching has to go to the city council their school board even if you
[26:58.160 --> 27:02.240]  don't have children you've got to go to the county commission people are watching those
[27:02.240 --> 27:08.480]  commissions those those hearings go out they get picked up they go viral everyone especially america's
[27:08.480 --> 27:14.720]  veterans this is the real fight for the republic itself must go every week to every televised
[27:14.720 --> 27:20.240]  hearing whether you're in a small town or a big city everyone must call c-span everyone must call
[27:20.240 --> 27:26.480]  on the liberal talk radio everyone must understand that this is a massive historic crossroads and
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.880]  the enemies of freedom know that we need a maximum effort to go out and to study the ballot and to
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.840]  vote for good people and to just do everything we can to just have such a giant red wave they
[27:37.840 --> 27:44.080]  can't stop us alexander one second the great reset in the war for the world the central

[30:21.520 --> 30:28.560]  matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward
[30:28.560 --> 30:34.480]  the matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as
[30:34.480 --> 30:39.920]  the bull buries himself into the dust they've got the ace of spades in their hand which is false
[30:39.920 --> 30:45.360]  flags before you launch a war you stage false flags that's the first thing you do because nobody

[33:22.640 --> 33:27.520]  the interview that was held yesterday on steve bannon's war room pandemic alex jones and steve
[33:27.520 --> 33:35.120]  bannon two powerhouses in the alternative right information sphere coming together to face off
[33:35.120 --> 33:40.000]  against our common enemy the globalist scumbags that are destroying this country in the entire world
[33:40.000 --> 33:46.800]  here it is without any further ado alex jones and steve bannon okay alex jones is my guest
[33:46.800 --> 33:52.640]  you're in the war room it's the 30th of august the in the year of our lord 2022 alex i think you've
[33:52.640 --> 33:56.480]  done a pretty good job of forcing them to read it given how you've walked through
[33:57.120 --> 34:04.400]  what you anticipate they're up to in in the next uh in the next 70 days uh because this your book
[34:04.400 --> 34:10.960]  makes the case that the united states of america this beloved constitutional republic we were bequeath
[34:10.960 --> 34:16.000]  is the central battlefield on this global reset in the war for the world can you explain that sir
[34:16.000 --> 34:22.160]  and i want to add in the developments that have happened with the fbi agents over the last 24 hours
[34:22.160 --> 34:26.960]  how that fits into your theory of the case as you lay it out in this book and this book is for the
[34:26.960 --> 34:32.480]  people that hate alex jones the most for the people that think he's a charlatan uh in a carney
[34:32.480 --> 34:38.000]  barker i strongly recommend that you read this book you may still hate him at the end of it
[34:38.640 --> 34:44.080]  but you will respect the intellectual integrity of this book because it's a very very powerful
[34:44.080 --> 34:49.360]  document alex jones we'll see if i appreciate that and look i'm on the air four hours a day
[34:49.360 --> 34:54.240]  i've been on there 28 years i screw around have some fun sometimes it gets taken out of context
[34:54.240 --> 34:58.640]  i hate myself sometimes but i don't really joke around and have fun anymore the last few years
[34:58.640 --> 35:02.480]  because the world is so serious now as they're having trouble you know finding the sad tire to
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.920]  take it out of context but getting back to your point about why they have to take america out
[35:07.920 --> 35:14.480]  it's what ronald reagan told us ronald reagan wasn't perfect getting conservative ideas through
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.440]  he got a lot of things done that were good some things that were bad but reagan made the world
[35:19.440 --> 35:26.720]  love america and made the world love american ideals of private property and family and freedom
[35:26.720 --> 35:34.000]  of religion uh and capitalism and security and peace through strength and he was an ambassador
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.400]  to the world the world absolutely loved america we were at the pinnacle of our strength at the end
[35:40.400 --> 35:46.640]  of world war two and then again with ronald reagan and then since then it's been our president's
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.800]  pretty much selling us out to globalism until trump comes along and then trump makes it about
[35:50.800 --> 35:56.560]  america again because how can america be a leader in the world if it's not free and successful
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.560]  and powerful so if we're bringing in a worldwide corporate panopticonic surveillance
[36:02.560 --> 36:10.960]  mark of the beast control freak mad scientist run great reset build back better depopulation
[36:11.840 --> 36:18.560]  nightmare you can't have a free country like the united states of america that's an example
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.000]  to others to aspire to as a model just like our constitution became the model of the world
[36:24.000 --> 36:30.960]  they want communist china and its authoritarianism and its death camps and the Uyghurs and forced
[36:30.960 --> 36:35.920]  labor uh and you know sixteen hour workdays and the government turning your power off when they
[36:35.920 --> 36:42.560]  want and social credit scores they want that to be the model these multinational fortune 500
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.560]  pretty much to a company allied with communist china to parlay that power into their world
[36:48.560 --> 36:53.280]  government now russia's got its own problems and isn't i'm not lionizing russia but it's trying to be
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.640]  its own sovereign nation that's why it's public enemy number one as a country but the united
[36:58.640 --> 37:04.640]  states and what it was and what it could be is the real number one enemy russia becomes a junior
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.280]  enemy when you pull back and realize everything is to undermine the country everything is to
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.760]  destroy confidence everything is to make to break up our families everything is to destroy
[37:13.760 --> 37:19.600]  our veterans everything is to ship in fentanyl it's all about demoralizing us to break our will
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.160]  then they can get control of our science and our military and once they believe they have a godless
[37:24.160 --> 37:31.120]  authoritarian america now we'll we will make nazi germany uh look like a choir boy compared to what
[37:31.120 --> 37:37.520]  the new world order can do once america falls and becomes an absolute tyranny so the war for the world
[37:37.520 --> 37:43.360]  the epicenter is the united states of america and and so that's why i titled it the war for the world
[37:45.200 --> 37:49.600]  the great reset in the world for the world does everybody should go it's on sale i i don't know
[37:49.600 --> 37:54.480]  if bookstores are going to stock this but definitely it's on amazon and you can go to your site so
[37:54.480 --> 37:58.240]  everybody should get it today you should read it i want to go to the center one of the central
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.800]  thesis is about decarbonization deindustrialization depopulation but you make the case about wokeness
[38:05.360 --> 38:11.440]  and also your work over the last 20 years in transhumanism tie that together in the great
[38:11.440 --> 38:19.120]  reset and why is this actually the underpinnings of what this fights about well george arwell's
[38:19.120 --> 38:22.800]  real name is eric blair and he'd been a top communist and a top thibian socialist and he'd
[38:22.800 --> 38:27.920]  fought against hitler in the in the spanish civil war and he believed in it and then he learned how
[38:27.920 --> 38:34.000]  evil stalin was and so he wrote a book 1984 about what the world would look like if stalin's
[38:34.000 --> 38:41.120]  revolution succeeded and in the book it's really about destroying language destroying words outlawing
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.960]  words uh making people scared of what they said what they did and that's what wokeness is is giving
[38:46.960 --> 38:52.240]  hollywood and the democratic party and the globalist control over language control over every facet
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.400]  of society to then bring in old tyrannies like discriminating against somebody off of what
[38:58.400 --> 39:04.240]  color they are something the west got rid of they turn our greatest strength around against us and
[39:04.240 --> 39:09.600]  now oh we're gonna fire the white teachers we're not we're you know because they're white uh we're
[39:09.600 --> 39:14.880]  gonna not have white airline pilots because there's too many white people these are authoritarian
[39:14.880 --> 39:23.280]  mainstays but now inverted so it's a corporate authoritarianism masquerading as as neoliberalism
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.560]  and so they need us to say two men can have a baby two women can have a baby they need us to
[39:28.560 --> 39:35.600]  believe uh that uh we can be a dog if we want to the furries phenomenon and drag queen story time
[39:35.600 --> 39:41.280]  they have to get us to accept outrageous things because they want us to accept human animal hybrids
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.480]  they want us to accept human clones they're already growing for organs they want us to accept
[39:47.360 --> 39:54.080]  no bar no control no governor on what these people can do and elon musk has talked about that
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.440]  he says beware of billionaires that worship ai gods and he's explained if we don't have 2.2
[39:59.440 --> 40:04.160]  children civilizational collapse they're building an anti-human civilization he's come out and says
[40:04.160 --> 40:09.760]  he wants a pro-human civilization he's on against cybernetic augmentation if you choose it if if
[40:09.760 --> 40:15.120]  it's not forced on you and if it helps you my uncle was in a motorcycle wreck uh 30 years ago
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.960]  had really bad epilepsy he got one of those vega nerve stimulators basically stopped having seizures
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.680]  then that failed three years ago he actually got a more advanced brain chip doesn't have seizures
[40:26.240 --> 40:30.960]  not in a wheelchair anymore lives great has a great life that brain chips a wonderful thing i'm
[40:30.960 --> 40:36.640]  not against progress but but we don't want to make people take brain chips so there's all
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.040]  these opportunities with all this technology we just don't want it to be tied to a global social
[40:41.040 --> 40:46.800]  credit score and to have the head of the debos groups say soon school children by 2030 we'll
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.760]  have a chip in the brain to communicate and if you don't have chip you won't be able to i mean this
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.440]  is what they're saying and it's an attack on free will so woke ism is about just getting us to stand
[40:57.440 --> 41:06.320]  in our head or if they say jump we say how high to to to accept absurdity so then we hand over our
[41:06.320 --> 41:11.760]  personal authority to the technocrats to the transhumanist this whole revolution isn't liberal
[41:11.760 --> 41:17.840]  it's not communist they use that as a control mechanism it is a transhumanist mad scientist

[45:58.800 --> 46:04.320]  donald trump and the magnet republicans represented extremism that threatens the very
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.640]  foundations of our republic i wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name in fact i
[46:10.640 --> 46:18.560]  bet it does i bet it's called operation matador they see us as the bull and they are shaky a red
[46:18.560 --> 46:26.720]  flag in our face and the matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.880]  the bull lunges forward the matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step
[46:32.880 --> 46:38.400]  aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust they've got the ace of spades in their
[46:38.400 --> 46:43.920]  hand which is false flags before you launch a war you stage false flags that's the first thing you
[46:43.920 --> 46:49.440]  do because nobody wants to say they started a war bad guys start wars so every time a war gets
[46:49.440 --> 46:54.560]  launched by bad guys they stage an event this is operation matador
[46:54.560 --> 47:10.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[47:18.720 --> 47:23.440]  all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen this is the alex jones show you're watching us on

[47:36.000 --> 47:40.560]  steve bannon and alex jones about the book the gray reset in the war for the world about
[47:40.560 --> 47:47.200]  transhumanism and the ultimate goals that those transhumanists have for the rest of us we're
[47:47.200 --> 47:52.800]  going to go back to that now and finish up with this interview before owens shawyer comes in and
[47:52.800 --> 47:57.760]  takes over the show for the second hour but here's the rest of steve bannon and alex jones talking
[47:57.760 --> 48:04.720]  yesterday okay our guest is alex jones alex napoleon used to tell his marshals the marshals of
[48:04.720 --> 48:10.320]  france uh and particularly after a couple of big engagement he said when you set out to take vienna
[48:10.960 --> 48:16.880]  take vienna uh what is your message now to the populist nationalist movement in this country
[48:16.880 --> 48:21.760]  this is inclusive nationalism regardless of your race or your ethnicity uh in particular
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.040]  it's hard working hispanic americans down the rear grand valley in south texas in uh in your
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.840]  beloved state also in arizona california all throughout the country african-american men
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.960]  particularly men that are turned off by this wokeness what is your message for the next 70
[48:36.960 --> 48:43.680]  days sir my message is plowshaw bill gates the democratic party the new world order
[48:43.680 --> 48:48.240]  they're a global party of authoritarianism it's the same in australia the same in germany the
[48:48.240 --> 48:52.640]  same in france the same here we need to join balsenaro we need to join victor or bomb we
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.600]  need to join other leaders around the world we need to get trump reelected we need to realize
[48:57.600 --> 49:03.680]  that we are being enslaved by corporate fascism masquerading as neoliberalism and you've got to
[49:03.680 --> 49:09.600]  be a hundred percent all in because if you think 49 percent increases in electricity prices last
[49:09.600 --> 49:14.560]  year is bad if you think gas prices doubling the last two years is bad if you think any of this is
[49:14.560 --> 49:22.640]  bad the the the the globalists admit they want to bankrupt us and bring us to our knees permanently
[49:22.640 --> 49:28.400]  they have horrible plans for the average american this is life and death this isn't a game as steve
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.160]  bannon said a few days ago and all the actuaries show it already the lockdowns the last two and
[49:34.160 --> 49:40.240]  a half years already the regulations already what's been done has put us into a collapse
[49:40.240 --> 49:46.160]  the the plane's crashing the question is can it be a survivable crash landing we need to get these
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.520]  people out of there now we need to get rid of the clout swabs that are in control of our
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.600]  government he brags his control of our government the canadian government he penetrates the
[49:53.600 --> 49:59.840]  governments we have to we have to stop them get them out of control of our system and then try
[49:59.840 --> 50:05.040]  to crash land the airplane or if you think things are bad now folks you have not seen anything yet
[50:05.040 --> 50:11.920]  this is a real global corporate technocrat takeover for economic and cultural warfare
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.680]  of america and the world this is the war for the world and people better choose aside freedom and
[50:17.680 --> 50:23.200]  justice and prosperity or total destruction the democratic party is literally run by international
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.480]  criminals they're literally run by the ccp it's an hunter biden's laptop and we now know this head
[50:28.480 --> 50:34.000]  fbi guy got marched out two days ago and and you know fired because we now know that it's been
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.840]  declassified he ordered the hunter laptop sealed he ordered them to threaten the media not to cover
[50:39.840 --> 50:46.080]  it he ordered it put in a secret file so nobody could see it and it's only because of a bunch of
[50:46.080 --> 50:53.920]  good fbi agents that lost their jobs or were put on leave that we even know about this so the fbi's
[50:53.920 --> 50:58.720]  not our enemy the people running it though are an enemy and we're never going to fix it until
[50:58.720 --> 51:02.880]  we have taken the whole government back over and i think we have to break up these federal agencies
[51:02.880 --> 51:10.640]  once and for all because you can't have one central national police force uh like the fbi but
[51:10.640 --> 51:15.760]  we we're at such a historic crossroads and it's all coming out in the open and the globalists
[51:15.760 --> 51:22.720]  have lost their only hope is to smash and collapse everything before the people actually wake up
[51:22.720 --> 51:29.120]  and bring them to justice they hope the collapse creates such a giant smoke screen and such a fog
[51:29.120 --> 51:34.240]  of war that somehow they slink away i've looked at every possible development in that they're never
[51:34.240 --> 51:39.120]  getting away with what they've done the question is do they want to just run off with their money
[51:39.120 --> 51:45.440]  now and and we'll you know put them in abstentia like napoleon or if they come creeping back and
[51:45.440 --> 51:50.000]  try another war with us they're gonna actually get put in prison for the rest of their lives
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.880]  i would be happy for some of these globalists to slink off because i understand how dangerous they
[51:54.880 --> 51:59.840]  are and and i understand this is gonna really cause world war you name it if it keeps going down
[51:59.840 --> 52:06.000]  this road so i would i would say if i was trump he should do a big televised speech
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.680]  and offer them amnesty offer them pardon if they just put up their hands and give up and stop now
[52:11.680 --> 52:16.160]  because they're identified the new orders out in the open the great resets out in the open
[52:16.160 --> 52:20.480]  more people learn about it every day everybody's turning against them they should just give up
[52:20.480 --> 52:25.600]  and come out with their hands up now and we will give them a good deal alex for those people
[52:25.600 --> 52:29.360]  they're hearing you for the first time and having a chance to get to the show given that they've
[52:29.360 --> 52:35.200]  tried to deplatform you over how do people get to the alex jones show and become a uh and get to

[55:44.640 --> 55:49.680]  this book we have a couple a few copies sitting around the office uh they're a little bit under
[55:49.680 --> 55:53.440]  lock and key they won't let me take one i haven't had a chance to read it but while we've been sitting
[55:53.440 --> 55:58.400]  here and listening to the interview i've been uh thumbing through a little bit and the great thing
[55:58.400 --> 56:03.760]  about it i think is even just from the first chapter you can tell alex jones wrote this it's not a
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.920]  goat it's not a ghost writer it's not you know somebody else and they just put alex jones's
[56:07.920 --> 56:15.200]  name on it the whole first chapter has this uh very long uh metaphor about tribesmen having
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.440]  arguments uh between sag and uther as they try to determine the best path forward for the tribe i
[56:21.440 --> 56:26.240]  mean if you read this and you know alex jones it's in his voice but of course it's different than
[56:26.240 --> 56:31.440]  what you get on uh info wars with him speaking off the cuff it's been researched it's been
[56:31.440 --> 56:35.680]  thought about but it is very much in the in line with what you expect from alex jones so
[56:36.240 --> 56:40.000]  i'm i'm just looking forward to reading this myself i know a lot of people out there are

[1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:18.080]  and the last one number 44 and one before that 43 bush and obama well their pictures are bush
[1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:25.440]  with his arm around eight-year-old barack obama because his step daddy adopted daddy lolo sotoro
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:34.320]  had done a lifetime worth of business with the bushes uh uncle george herbert walker after whom
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:41.520]  george herbert walker bush bush one president was named founded halibut in 1936 in oklahoma
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:47.600]  and lolo sotoro had been international executive vice president for standard oil
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:53.120]  there was talk of him being a cia asset well yes see he ran the death squads for the indonesian
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:01:01.120]  army on his own call anyone could be assassinated so when george herbert walker bush became head
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  of the cia under the fort administration he just got with his old buddy in the oil business lolo
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:18.960]  sotoro and pulled off the hits see uh barack's grandmother has been acknowledged as being the
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:26.720]  woman that operated the channels through which cia money went to the southwest pacific so she
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:37.040]  introduced her daughter who had just had barry barack to lolo sotoro and they got married and
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:43.920]  lolo sotoro adopted barack obama the name was changed to barry sotoro now he went to high
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:49.440]  school in awahi i know about that high school almost sent my oldest son to it i got afforded
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:56.640]  but i didn't think he observed deserved it 20 years ago the tuition was $95,000 a year not
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:02.560]  including room and board when obama went there i've talked to two of his classmates they independently
[1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:09.600]  state that the tuition not including room and board was 45,000 now business insider reports
[1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:18.400]  his income for 2017 at over 200 million net that's after taxes deductions write-offs for this last
[1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:27.200]  year 2018 they reported it as 570 plus million dollars and that's after all deductions tax write
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:36.240]  trump doesn't make that net i mean even some of the richest people in america don't make that why
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:42.880]  because when his stepdaddy died he was one of the 1015 richest men on earth and he left everything
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:48.720]  in a trust fund operated out of indonesia sotoro american government can't touch it
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:55.920]  that makes barack obama one third beneficiary for the assets of one of the 1015 richest men on earth
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:04.960]  so we got a game run on us so you know that little thing that bush w does when he gets
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:10.720]  with michelle they giggle and he gives a candy the inside thing is that supposed to be the same
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:16.160]  kind of candy he used to give to our husband when he was six seven eight years old it's a big club
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:25.360]  and you ain't in it you and i are not in the big club well judge joe brown just laid it out he's
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:31.600]  joining us next week on the show attorney thomas wrens with the latest on the collapse of the whole

[1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:29.760]  and celebrated international lawyer enri t king and anthony rinds he won his national
[1:06:29.760 --> 1:06:33.600]  trailblazer award for political action assisting a number of state national legislative and
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:38.640]  regulatory reforms i won't go over all the great huge cases he's been involved with
[1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:45.200]  but his website is rinds-log dot com and he joins us to talk about the huge events taking place
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:50.640]  with him admitting the shots don't work the rats leaving the sinking ship admitting the fda
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:55.760]  overroad the regulator saying the shot was dangerous this is a seismic moment i mean i
[1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:03.680]  don't know how we quantify thomas how big this is man alex it is huge and i've been so honored to
[1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:08.160]  to be with you talking about this over the last couple of years i mean you've done so much helping
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:17.440]  us get this out and i gotta say you know we see now this entire narrative is crumbling and i gotta
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:24.480]  tell you one of my concerns is as we're looking forward they are now trying to pin this on trump
[1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:29.520]  they're trying to put this this out there they just released the house just released a report
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:34.720]  yeah i was it yesterday or the day before trying to pin uh operation warp speed and all this stuff
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:40.000]  on trump despite the fact that berksis has admitted she's been lying to him that fauci has been lying
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:46.720]  to all these people like but we've got him alex we've got him dead to rights we're getting ready
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:54.480]  to bring out we've got a first-hand witness to them creating this in a lab in wuhan we know that
[1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:59.840]  fauci funded it we know it's gained a function it's coming they're running you're right the rats
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:04.240]  are scurrying and this is historic and the question is how much longer before we're ready for the
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:12.960]  nuremberg trials lay that out for people how huge this is okay so let me start out with with this
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:19.280]  because i think this is really a critical thing right now so you see ran poll and some and uh
[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:24.240]  senator johnson some of these guys who are fighting on this gain of function stuff i want to start
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:30.720]  with that because i think that is crucial because fauci lied to congress about this now
[1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:36.000]  steve bannon can talk to you about you know the the issues that come with that you can certainly
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:43.200]  talk extensively about what happens when you start speaking truth to power and uh you know
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:48.080]  they come after you and persecute you but anthony fauci seems to be doing okay let's talk about
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:52.880]  gain of function we had hours and hours of testimony from a bunch of scientists who are
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:58.480]  entirely too smart for their own good i'm going to break this down for real people like a lawyer
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:04.960]  right what is gain of function there's no legal definition it literally means that you're you're
[1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:11.120]  doing work on a virus in this case where that virus is going to gain function so let's let's look at
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:17.760]  this anthony fauci said he didn't fund gain of function well let's ask eco health alliance who
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:22.640]  was getting his funding whether they were doing this so if we say to eco health alliance were you
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:28.240]  doing gain of function work they're going to him and haul around but the question is did you experiment
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:33.920]  on coronaviruses in a lab and the answer is yes we know because they've admitted it it's on record
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:39.600]  there's peer reviewed publications talking about it then we asked them the following question was
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:44.640]  that experimentation designed to alter or modify coronaviruses and the answer is yes
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:51.680]  right there you see creation of chimeric cires like virus right they did this it's a it's
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:59.520]  established we know about it so if you if you experimented on coronavirus and if the result
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:06.240]  was to change coronaviruses did said did said change result in additional functionality or
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:12.400]  change functionality well obviously it did why else would you do it and if that's that enough
[1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:16.480]  we've got the peer reviewed articles and them admitting that that's exactly what they did
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:25.040]  so then we would say eco health alliance using the funding that anthony fauci gave you you have
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:31.280]  already admitted on record repeatedly that you experimented on coronaviruses that experiment
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:37.600]  changed the functionality of the virus and in doing so that that virus gained functionality
[1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:44.720]  how is that not gain a function if anybody can explain that to me i would love to hear it because
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:51.360]  you know that comes down to did anthony fauci lied to congress and yes he did he belongs under
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:59.840]  gitmo under gitmo uh so we've got gain a function proven now the question is did that gain a function
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:05.920]  result in the creation of sars-covid too yes yes it did and i'm going to explain how that
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:12.080]  happened over the next coming weeks we've got a whistleblower uh he's he's brilliant scientist work
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:18.400]  for sandia labs work for eco health alliance and he's a veteran standing up for a country good guy
[1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:24.000]  we've got all sorts of things coming out on this all sorts of things happening on this
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:32.080]  and uh because of that we now know they created this in the lab using funding from fauci
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:38.400]  and the result was the the biggest pandemic disaster in human history
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:45.200]  and then they decided to cover up and lie about the cure which is worse worse than the disease
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:50.080]  and so we got us we got a true snake oil salesman situation here alex they create the
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:55.360]  disease they create the cure the cure is worse than the disease and now we have this giant mess
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:01.120]  that is so massive and i want you to drill back into this whistleblower and the gain
[1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:05.040]  of function which is all admitted why do you think suddenly the rats are leaving the sinking
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:09.680]  ship why do you think suddenly they're admitting okay we didn't know okay we fired the fba boards
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:14.000]  and authorize because we thought it was the best thing to do what do they know is about to come out
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.560]  obviously what you and others are doing yeah so i mean i i would love to be able to take credit
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:27.280]  for everything i don't know what i do know is that about two months ago and i you know alex
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:32.160]  you've known me for over a year i don't leak if things come out it's because i want them to come
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:40.720]  out right so a few months back we accidentally leaked which was intentional that we were working
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:47.760]  with dr andrew huff dr andrew huff is the whistleblower i'm talking about right uh so we we talked
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:53.120]  that we were talking with dr andrew huff within a couple weeks of us saying that suddenly fauci
[1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:58.400]  sacks all these different people started saying you know i wonder if there's any credibility to
[1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:03.200]  this lab leak theory suddenly they were willing to talk about that even though they had denied it
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:08.000]  outright ever since the reason that they were doing that is because they know what huff has
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:13.120]  they know the documents he has they know he what where he worked and what he knows i think they're
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:19.200]  terrified of this we're going to be providing this to senator johnson if rand paul will accept it
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.400]  we'll provide it to him we're going to be providing this evidence to everyone and these guys have been
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:29.280]  going after this from the beginning going after it hard and you know even for the guys in congress
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:35.520]  who've been avoiding talking about the jab no one is is avoiding talking about fauci creating this
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:40.800]  because it's it's inexcusable so we're going to give them that information i think one of the
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:44.720]  big things that's changed is i think they're terrified of what we're going to bring and they
[1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:52.240]  should be because it's unbelievable and uh you know just for you alex just for info wars because
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:57.520]  i think you'll appreciate this i think there's a really important question i want to put out there
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:06.640]  for the viewers so going back to the 1990s china's been talking about using bio warfare against the
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:15.520]  united states if you fast forward to the to the 2000s and 2010s china didn't have the capacity
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:23.200]  the technology to do this advanced genetic engineering suddenly anthony fauci decides he's
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:29.440]  going to fund this super advanced genetic engineering that would essentially transfer that
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.720]  technology to the chinese communist party and they're going to do so in the wuhan labs which
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:43.040]  are known to be bio bioweapons development labs does anybody in this country truly believe that our
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:49.840]  do d and our intelligence agencies were unaware of this does anybody truly believe that they didn't
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:57.840]  know that and that you know our nation's about enemy was was not looking to get this data and get
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:04.720]  this information so that they could use it against us and if so then why is it that we allowed this
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:11.600]  to happen why why did our intelligence community and our do d why did they not step in and stop it
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.360]  why did they actively allow this to occur and by the way we're going to be producing evidence on this
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:23.360]  so i think these are really important questions and i think they go to why this has been so
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:30.800]  covered up and why this has been so so hidden p s let's also not overlook hunter biden's connections
[1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:37.040]  in this metabiotta who was invested in by rosemont seneca hunter hunter biden's uh
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:42.960]  thing let's not overlook their connections to eco health alliance during the time that sarah's two
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:47.440]  was created in the lab all right thomas rinds stay right there we're going to come back and get into this

[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:56.480]  so thomas wrench has been at the tip of the spear as a lawyer for two years fighting this
[1:20:56.480 --> 1:21:02.320]  covered rollout tyranny to have the cdc head admit we lied to you the shot doesn't protect you
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:07.520]  had to admit that the boards tried to override the boosters uh to have them sing the lockdowns
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:14.080]  were wrong why are they doing this and and what do we expect to come next what is precipitating
[1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:19.440]  foul cheat resigning what is precipitating congress coming out blaming trump which yeah
[1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:23.200]  trump's part to blame for going on the warp speed but he didn't do force inoculation
[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:27.600]  he didn't push the lockdowns he was against them asking i mean he certainly woke up later
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:31.120]  but but he's still defending the shots letting them scapegoat him
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:35.680]  which i'm not even about defending trump i'm just simply saying i want the real guilty parties
[1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:41.200]  like fauci and peter dazik and bill gates to go to prison so please continue thomas wrench
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:48.720]  yeah so i mean and there's so much going on i mean that's literally we've got just
[1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:55.200]  immense amounts of information um in terms of of what's going on with this you got to understand
[1:21:55.200 --> 1:22:00.640]  fauci they know that this is coming out they know that we're going to be able to show fauci
[1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:06.320]  was behind this so they've got to get fauci out of this lightning rod position everything about
[1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:11.840]  this was a failure the jabs are being proven to be deadly everything's going south so they
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:18.240]  got to get fauci out of there now fauci's not retiring he said that right the reason he's
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:23.120]  not retiring is because they he knows where all the bodies are buried so he's going to go into
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:27.840]  some cushy private sector position where they're going to pay him an immense amount of money to
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:33.600]  basically stay quiet uh and if he doesn't stay quiet welcome to the jeffrey eppstein show part
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:41.840]  two so you know that's i think what's going on with fauci uh with regards to congress you know
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:48.560]  alex i think you and i did an interview on this probably a year plus ago you know we said listen
[1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:52.960]  these jabs they're gonna we're gonna win on this we're gonna prove that they're poison it's gonna
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:59.600]  come out and you know when they do that when that happens they're going to say it's trump's fault
[1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:04.160]  operation warp speed that's what they were going to do that was always something that they've had
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:09.760]  in their back pocket now we're hoping and i'm praying that the donald will let us come and
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:14.240]  brief him and explain to him what's actually going on so that he can come out and tell the truth
[1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:19.920]  because i think that's his best mechanism for dealing with this politically but uh you know
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:24.960]  he's been lied to by everybody and that's not a tremendous surprise i mean listen look at
[1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:31.280]  even his friends in the media his supposed friends at fox news have been telling you know
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.640]  promoting this jab because everybody's been bought off so you know that's just it's just
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:42.480]  unbelievable he hasn't had anybody he could trust on this issue and the people who he can trust
[1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:46.800]  don't understand the issue in depth to rabble properly brief so that's where i think that's
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:53.040]  going and i think that congress especially i mean mcconnell these rhinos they do anything to get rid
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:58.000]  of trump so they're going to be more than happy to try and lay the deaths from these jabs at his
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:03.200]  feet just so long as they can keep him out anything they got i agree some of my listeners are saying
[1:24:03.200 --> 1:24:08.800]  why are you defending trump no he's not the one to to blame it's fouchy and bill gates and the new
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:12.560]  world order and obama with a game of function research i don't want them to get away with it
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:17.760]  what do you think trump needs to do right now to make sure the guilty actually get in trouble so
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:21.920]  trump's got to come out and he's got to start immediately talking about the dangers of this
[1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:28.080]  jab he's got to let us brief him and give him real science real science will i've offered i will pay
[1:24:28.080 --> 1:24:33.200]  on my dime to fund getting mccollum alone all these geniuses down there where he can get some real
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:39.760]  science we'll give him every bit of data we got he needs to help us make make this truth available
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:47.120]  if he does that you know it listen the guy is 100 pro america everybody makes mistakes
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.400]  this is a great opportunity for him if he if he's willing and we would be honored to help him in
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:57.200]  any way that we can that's what i think trump's got to do but i know that a lot of people say
[1:24:57.200 --> 1:25:02.560]  oh trump did this because he you know he should have spoke out listen you got to understand
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:09.120]  something we've been trying to get information to trump for years on this and so i don't think
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:12.960]  there's anybody on this planet more frustrated than me with that but you got to understand
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:18.720]  something i'm a nobody attorney from ohio why is donald trump going to listen to me when he's got
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:25.120]  people from fox news professional advisors high end doctors all lying to him so we have to build
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:30.560]  our credibility well it's turned out everything we've said was right alex this is i mean you
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:36.400]  should play this on on repeat alex was right alex was right alex was right everywhere we go alex
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:43.120]  was right you know here's another case you were right we've known this but we had to get it to the
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:49.360]  point where our voice was strong enough to overcome the swamp and the swamp is powerful they've got a
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.480]  big voice and it's hard to tell who's swamp and who's and they wouldn't be positioning trump to
[1:25:54.480 --> 1:25:59.920]  take the fall unless they know they were in trouble that's exactly right if they could keep going with
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:06.480]  this they would and i'm going to tell you this is this is the issue this is what was behind the
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:14.000]  election they could never have stolen 2020 without covid and they they could never have done half of
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.280]  what they've done without covid i mean if you look at the destruction of our economy the amount of
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:24.560]  money that's been printed and transferred you know as the globalist war against america this is the
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:31.760]  great reset it is absolute well i mean they even told us at the world economic forum the crowd covid
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:37.520]  was the most proper profitable event in us history or in world history well maybe if you're a billionaire
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:44.400]  globalist but not for you and i i know it sure wasn't profitable for me uh you know so these guys
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.120]  the little guy got crossed the billionaires doubled their money at least that this was their war
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:57.360]  yeah and let's not overlook the world the chinese communist party who's who's as much our enemy as
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:03.600]  anybody right now you've got the enemy of our enemy right the the world economic forum and the ccp
[1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:09.840]  are cozying up and working together and whatever they have to do to destroy freedom right whatever
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:15.920]  they have to do china cannot have the shining beacon for freedom on the hill doing well because
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:20.560]  if they do their people are going to say why in god's name would we want to live in this crap hole
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:26.640]  and it's the same sort of thing these globalists they don't want they don't want upward mobility
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:32.000]  they don't want a middle class those people are threats they're their competition so what what do
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:36.800]  they do well they eliminate competition that's how they do it so these things this is all coming
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:41.920]  together there's a whole bunch of people that are the enemies of freedom and basically it's it's them
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:47.920]  the globalists the communists versus us we the people who want freedom and now they're trying
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:52.400]  to depend on trump who they tricked he needs to figure that out thomas rins you're on fire so i
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:56.400]  want you to host the next two segments so you're uninterrupted what are you going to be covering

[1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:05.360]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:23.120]  hey everybody hey glad to be here uh man aren't you all disappointed you turn in for alex jones
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:30.000]  and you're stuck with tom runs wow um listen i am honored to be here it's my privilege that alex
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:37.440]  would let me rant here for a couple segments and he had a very very important thing came up
[1:33:37.440 --> 1:33:42.000]  it's so important that he was stuck leaving a guy like me to talk so i'm gonna get try and fill
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:46.560]  his shoes the best i can i'd be lucky to wear his sandals but we're gonna do what we can do
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:51.920]  so what we're talking about is we're talking about uh what's going on with this whole covid
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:56.960]  debacle it's coming down it's coming down in a big way you know and we talked about the gain
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:02.480]  of function stuff we know that anthony fauci has lied about gain of function he funded this work
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:08.160]  we know that this was created in the lab in wuhan and you know i asked a question do you really
[1:34:08.160 --> 1:34:13.680]  think that we created this and had this sort of technology transferred to china without our intel
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:19.440]  and military knowing of course not of course they knew about it so i'm looking forward to bring out
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:27.360]  that information but i want to talk about another aspect of this that i think is absolutely critical
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:34.080]  the thing that everybody wants to know is what can i do right how do i get involved so this is a
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:38.880]  critical component of this and this goes to what alex is dealing with alex has been censored he's
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:43.920]  been beat up he's been attacked i mean i don't think i could list another media personality
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:49.600]  that's been more attacked than alex jones bannon's close but you know alex jones has been through
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:56.480]  absolute hell and you know maybe not every time but he has been right far more times than wrong
[1:34:56.480 --> 1:35:04.000]  he's been on to it he's been on to it so why is that why is that well it goes to what the world
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:10.720]  economic forum just just announced they need to tighten down ahead of sense ahead of the elections
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:16.720]  they need to tighten down on censorship they need to tighten down on uh you know this free speech
[1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:23.040]  stuff they call it misinformation but the reality is is they don't want us to communicate they can't
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:28.480]  have alex jones out there they can't have steve bannon out there they can't have these guys out
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.800]  there telling the truth if these guys are out there telling the truth and you're hearing the truth
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:39.440]  boy it's hard to sell a lie when someone's telling the truth right next to it right so truth is critical
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:45.120]  and communicating with each other working with each other is critical what are we doing about that
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:50.000]  so one of the things that i've done is early on you know i'm a nobody attorney from a little town
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:54.960]  in ohio right i don't have a huge firm i'm not a big shot i've got a platform because guys like
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:36:01.520]  alex have allowed me to speak they've allowed me to come out here and do my thing but i didn't have
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:08.320]  a big platform nobody knew who i was five years ago so what we had to do is we had to build that why
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:13.200]  why because i recognized early on if we wanted to have a chance in the courts if we wanted to
[1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:19.280]  have a chance elsewhere we had to build that platform up we had to make it so big that no
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:24.320]  matter how much these guys are spending on lies and controlling the mainstream media that we would
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:29.840]  have an alternative mechanism for getting the truth out we've been working on that ever since
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:34.240]  and for any of you that have followed my work i always talk about hitting these guys legally
[1:36:34.240 --> 1:36:39.920]  politically and pr all three and none of the three are more important mind you i'm a lawyer
[1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:45.600]  and i'm telling you that the pr and the political aspects are as important as the courts and if you
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:51.200]  don't use all three you can't win in any one of them the other side has been attacking us using
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:56.960]  all three for years and it's worked incredibly well so we've had to build this we've had to build
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:01.840]  alternative communications networks so we've done things so one of the things that one of the groups
[1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:07.200]  that i work with a ton is make americans free again mafa make americans free again is the one who
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:11.920]  sponsored the work that andrew hoff and i are doing that it's you know bringing out all this
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:17.120]  gain of function work and all these sorts of things it's a huge deal pam popper a good friend
[1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:22.320]  of mine yes she founded man mafa and uh you know we're building an attorney network there we're
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:26.400]  building this we're building that and we're communicating with the membership and it's
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:32.720]  all over the country why is that so important that is exactly what they don't want us to do
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:37.840]  they don't want us to communicate they don't want us to talk to each other they don't want us to
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:43.040]  let you know what's going on they they need to shut down the alex jones's of this world
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:46.320]  and they need to shut everything else down now let me let me explain to you how the
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:51.760]  importance is and why sharing information is crucial the first amendment is everything
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:56.320]  everything the first and second amendment protect the rest without the first and second
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:00.480]  amendment the rest of the constitution is going to go away and the reason for that is
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:04.960]  is the second amendment is the ultimate backstop and i don't need to explain that
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:10.160]  but the first amendment freedom of consciousness which is freedom of religion
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:17.360]  and freedom to communicate and associate and to speak that is the foundation of our nation
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:23.760]  without it we're done when they censor alex jones they're censoring you when facebook says alex
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:30.240]  jones can't talk they're saying you can't talk they don't want your perspective out there now
[1:38:30.240 --> 1:38:37.440]  what's truth well i don't know i mean if you ask the left uh it can be my truth and my truth can
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.480]  be that i'm a cowl i hey i'm a furry i'm a cow today what the heck does that mean it's the
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:48.960]  stupidest thing i've ever heard but to the left that's where we're at right that's that that's
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:55.440]  truth it's not misinformation for an eight-year-old to say that i need a litter box at school because
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:02.160]  i'm a furry cat today but it's misinformation for alex jones to say hey these jabs aren't safe
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:09.040]  can anyone explain this to me this is insanity it is absurdity that is why we have to develop
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:15.840]  these alternative systems and alternative mechanisms for travel uh communicating we are working with
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:21.440]  groups like info wars with groups like mafa with all of these different groups to make sure that we
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:28.800]  can get this word out because here's the deal when covid started i did a speech this weekend or last
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:34.320]  weekend this with clay clark with the reawakening tour right 15 minutes before i went on stage
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:39.760]  suddenly the feed got cut it was supposed to be broadcast live by a whole bunch of streaming
[1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:46.560]  partners it got cut well that's shocking i wonder why could it be that they didn't want us to talk
[1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:52.000]  about the whistleblower who'd given me the social security death master file you know the death
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:58.240]  master file that showed that you know that big spike and sorry and corona the deaths that occurred
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:05.120]  when coronavirus first hit you know in march ish of 2020 the big spike that was so bad that we had
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:11.440]  to shut down our country lock people in their houses mask our kids for god knows how long
[1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:17.520]  that spike you know the the worst spike in history could it be that the reason that they
[1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:25.280]  didn't want this out there was because that spike was minuscule minuscule compared to the death spike
[1:40:25.280 --> 1:40:31.440]  that was shown in the social security master death file when the covet jabs were rolled out and then
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:37.440]  again when the covet jabs were mandated that's what they didn't want you to hear they don't want you
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:43.120]  to hear that they've got to shut down our communications you know they didn't want you to
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:49.680]  hear that along with the uh the accompanying spike from des from sars covet too which did occur there
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:56.720]  was a spike but they also didn't want you to hear that there was an accompanying decline in inpatient
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:03.600]  stays according to medicare medicaid and that that decline in inpatient stays was so substantial
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:09.600]  that it was probably a major contributing factor to that first spike basically sars covet too
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:15.200]  is the thing and did kill people nowhere near as many as they said they've lied about it from
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:19.760]  the beginning we have the evidence we have the proof and here's the thing about the stuff that I
[1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:27.360]  had at the reawakening tour this is the social security death master file right so when we see
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:32.000]  reports about what the insurance companies have anthony file chief can say well I didn't see that
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:37.520]  I didn't know I you know it was this is private information we didn't have that he can't say that
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:44.720]  they didn't have the social security death file there's no way anybody could be so incompetent
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:50.000]  to be rolling this stuff out and not and not be looking at the social security death file
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.600]  they knew how many people were dying you know when this first rolled out the biggest spike in deaths
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:03.520]  since 2010 the highest monthly deaths occurred in the months right after the rollout that january
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:12.240]  february ish time frame of 2021 right after that and what happened so in 2020 december of 2020 ish
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:19.840]  these jabs they start becoming available in 2021 and they wanted to prioritize this for sick people
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:27.120]  they did and guess what happened those sick people died they forced it in the nursing homes
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:32.800]  and then the people in the nursing homes died they knew it they covered it up why is anthony
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:38.560]  file chief leaving because all of this is coming out because that crook was behind this he knew
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:44.560]  what was going on and now there's accountability coming we've got to hold these guys accountable
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:50.400]  and we got to not only ask what did anthony file chief know but we also got to ask who paid him
[1:42:50.400 --> 1:43:01.040]  off stay with us we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen if millions of people get this book

[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:32.400]  the reckoning fest occurring down in mesquite this is important right this is important this
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:38.480]  goes to what i was talking about and i can't stress this enough supporting alex jones supporting these
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:44.000]  these events supporting these things this is how we get the truth out the one thing they didn't
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.480]  want us to do is they didn't want us to be together they didn't want us to bond they didn't want us to
[1:48:48.480 --> 1:48:53.360]  shake hands they didn't want me to be able to stand next to you and let you know that you weren't
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:49:02.080]  alone you didn't have a third eye you weren't some sort of a freak show we the people we are the
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:09.120]  majority this is the real secret this is alex jones secret nor the majority people don't
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:14.320]  realize that you've got to come to these events now and then and i don't get to go to as many as
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:18.960]  i'd like because you know i got to do that lawyer thing a little bit here and there and uh i got all
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:24.320]  these other obligations but i love when i get to because i get to shake hands and meet people
[1:49:24.320 --> 1:49:30.800]  and it's critical i cannot tell you how important it is that we the people come together as peaceful
[1:49:30.800 --> 1:49:38.640]  patriotic americans and and let each other know that we got each other's backs i also want to
[1:49:38.640 --> 1:49:45.520]  bring chris on because chris is a he's a normal guy just like me and i want you to see that normal
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:53.040]  guys like me like chris we're fighting and making a difference or at least trying to and the important
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:59.280]  part of that is that you understand that you're watching me on a tv show right now and you know
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:05.360]  godboss alex jones it's actually a really big popular tv show and they still let me talk but
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:11.920]  you don't have to be a big shot to make a big impact you just got to have the courage and the
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:18.640]  tenacity to stand so i'm gonna ask that you you you stick with us here chris uh let's bring chris
[1:50:18.640 --> 1:50:26.400]  on chris how you doing i'm blessed and deserved brother now that i'm on here with you and and uh
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:32.720]  wow to be on info wars has been a dream come true and i actually prayed about it this morning when
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:39.520]  i walked into the venue i'm at the venue friends i'm at the venue i walked in and i thought i was
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:46.640]  just gonna see this empty shell it's completely done i i i literally took pictures in the video
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:53.200]  and and really um couldn't even stop you know with the motion i was so overwhelmed and i said
[1:50:53.200 --> 1:51:00.160]  yeah i looked at god and i said please let's fill every single seat in this place and here i am on
[1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:08.000]  info wars with you and alex jones and own shroy and and no place better heroes on the show on this
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:16.800]  channel everything on this show is about courage is about integrity say what you mean mean what you
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:22.800]  say and what i love about them is that it doesn't matter what people think it doesn't want matt it
[1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:29.440]  doesn't matter what people they still deliver the truth they still deliver the facts regardless of
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:35.600]  whatever backlash that they get it doesn't matter and i love that that's people have to know i want
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:41.440]  it and that's what i want to talk about so you know i uh alex gives me the great honor of sitting
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:47.280]  here today and uh you know i was like you know what i want to call chris because i knew what we
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:52.400]  were talking about today and i know that you got the reckoning fest up in mesquite this weekend
[1:51:52.400 --> 1:51:58.320]  and i hope people will come but you know what i wanted to talk about is so i met you at the
[1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:04.160]  reawakening tour and much like a you know a lot of the rest of us we all met through that tour a
[1:52:04.160 --> 1:52:10.000]  lot of us you know came together but that tour brought together people who were not willing to
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  sell out not willing to bend like alex shones people who are willing to stand for something
[1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:24.400]  chris um are you a superhero are you are you a billionaire philanthropist playboy superhero
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:32.800]  or something you see i'm on the floor you've always you're a stasi dresser but outside of that
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:38.000]  and you've got some really cool shoes that i've seen over the years but uh outside of that
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:47.360]  you're you're a pretty regular guy let's talk about reckoning fest yes let's talk about some
[1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:50.640]  names let's talk about some of the people that are going to show up at this and i'm going somewhere
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:57.120]  with this it's not just a promo by the way i'm not trying to sell sell tickets i'm i'm pushing it
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.200]  because it's i don't get a dime out of this right i'm just showing up because it's the right thing to
[1:53:01.200 --> 1:53:07.200]  do i want to promote this um chris isn't paying me to be there what i'm trying to do is i'm trying
[1:53:07.200 --> 1:53:14.640]  to set the example chris is a regular dude i'm a regular guy you give me a bear and a campfire
[1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:23.200]  and i am a happy man right but we're fighting this is what they're afraid of tyranny is an illusion
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:29.680]  it's always been an illusion and it only works when we the people allow it to happen so chris
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:35.040]  what i'd love is i'd love for you to tell a little bit about your story so people can see
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:42.320]  see it's not superhero chris that put together this chris has lindell or logan also it's a big
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:48.240]  people coming in he was able to pull all this stuff together chris tell us your superhero
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:53.440]  background billionaire philanthropist playboy uh background that has facilitated you being able
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:54:00.880]  to do all this now i'm just the average person that is just sick and tired of being sick and
[1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:06.960]  tired and i didn't have the pleasure or the honor to fight for my country when i was younger but now
[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:12.960]  i'm fighting for my country now i'm doing something and you know it's one thing to say it it's another
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:19.520]  thing to put your steps you put your steps forward right god puts your steps he orders them you just
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:26.000]  obey them um and when this came through to me i literally was like really god you really want
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.120]  me to do this and take this on i don't have anybody that what's working with me i don't have and i
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:35.360]  don't have an assistant and i have somebody that answers a phone i've answered every single phone
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:41.680]  every single email every single text i've gotten people hotel rooms i've got people flying in all
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:48.160]  over the country you know why because it matters it matters that you're here it matters that you're
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:55.280]  sitting in that seat because what's gonna go down on saturday and sunday it's gonna make history
[1:54:55.280 --> 1:55:03.120]  right the reason i chose the reckoning fest uncensored is because i'm sick and tired of things
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:08.320]  being censored i'm sick and tired go to events and they tell me well baby trump you can't talk
[1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:13.440]  about that and baby trump you can't talk about this well then why are we having an event how we call

[1:59:52.720 --> 2:00:04.560]  the new world order it's alex jones we have a whistleblower doctor joining us it's been censored
[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:12.000]  next segment but first let's go to this report has america been slated for starvation is america's
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:19.200]  food supply being sabotaged or are we being judged by god and plagued with the future famine
[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:25.440]  as michael snider details on his economic collapse blog a worldwide drought mainly in the northern
[2:00:25.440 --> 2:00:31.520]  hemisphere is impacting agricultural production in the us in europe and this scarcity of various
[2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:37.600]  produce and meat is going to raise food prices in the months and years ahead in italy farmers in
[2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:43.360]  some parts of the country cost up to 80 percent of their harvest this year due to the severe drought
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:49.120]  conditions in the region in france with a lack of rainfall has prompted widespread limits on fresh
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:56.720]  water use they are experiencing their driest month in recorded history since march of 1961 this is
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:02.720]  especially impactful on the world's food supply since france is the fourth largest exporter of
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:09.920]  wheat in germany the most important river the rye has dropped to dangerously low levels and even dried
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:16.560]  up completely in some places not only does this drop in water affect crop irrigation but the river
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:23.520]  is used to transport the vast majority of all goods in and out of germany including coal oil and
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:30.480]  most importantly food in the elb river hunger stones have reappeared which were used to mark
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:38.240]  low river levels that would forecast famines in the land on one stone from 1616 it reads if you see
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:44.640]  me cry here in the us about half the nation is experiencing some level of drought but the lack
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:50.880]  of precipitation is particularly bad in texas where the dallas fort worth area has had no
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:57.360]  measurable rain for two straight months the lack of water has led many ranchers to panic sell their
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:04.000]  herds being unable to water them which will impact beef prices in the future is this just a typical
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:10.720]  weather cycle where a season of drought comes and goes or is this a true climate disaster as the
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:17.600]  global warming alarmists would like us to think and with food prices poised to explode the question
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:23.920]  arises what can we do about it will weather modification technology that has the ability to
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:30.400]  create rain by cloud seeding be brought to the mainstream public at last as a solution to this
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:37.040]  worldwide drought china the ua e indonesia and other nations have already come out of the closet
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:42.560]  with their cloud seeding technology so will the u.s. government declassify their own weather
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:50.080]  manipulating tools to meet this crisis or perhaps this weather modification technology is what caused
[2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:55.600]  the drought across the world by prematurely pulling water vapor out of the atmosphere and
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:01.600]  showering the land with kim trail tainted rain how many decades have governments around the world
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:08.880]  used these cloud seeding agents chemical compounds made from aluminum barium potassium iodide solid
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:15.920]  carbon dioxide and various salt compounds aside from farmers and ranchers losing a large percentage
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:21.440]  of their products due to a lack of rainwater food processing plants across the u.s. have been
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:28.080]  mysteriously bursting into flames or shutting down further fueling the food crisis caused by the
[2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:34.960]  drought starting in 2021 the uptick in disruptions at food processing facilities began and today
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:40.800]  the number stands well over a hundred incidents that led to the shutdown of significant production
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:47.280]  starting in 2022 there was a shutdown at least once a week these incidents destroyed damage or
[2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:53.680]  impacted food processing facilities indefinitely either by fires diseases or an assortment of
[2:03:53.680 --> 2:04:00.880]  accidents like plane crashes these incidents ceased beef and pork packing plants milk parlors
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:07.440]  egg farms fertilizer plants various produce packing and processing facilities and an assortment of
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:13.840]  farms for turkeys ducks and chickens have been cold millions of animals killed for outbreaks of
[2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:22.000]  bird flu massive corporations like general mills keloch nestly walmart smithfield jbs and purina
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:28.880]  have also shut down production have we been slated for starvation or are we being backed into a
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:35.440]  corner so we accept the terms of the new world order's great reset agenda although we're armed
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:40.640]  with the powerful military and the second amendment to protect ourselves from an invasion or a
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:48.080]  tyrannical government is food the weapon being used against us just like henry kissinger said

[2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:23.440]  join us he's been exposing what's all confirmed now they tried to censor her here's one of the
[2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:29.040]  local tv stations she talked to us life insurance companies have reported an overwhelming and
[2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:34.640]  unexplainable increase in all caused deaths among 18 to 49 year olds so along with that
[2:06:34.640 --> 2:06:39.680]  there's also been an increase in certain medical diagnosis such as miscarriages and bell's palsy
[2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:44.560]  here to give us her take on the new data and what she believes could be causing the rise in numbers
[2:06:44.560 --> 2:06:50.080]  is emergency medicine and disaster specialist dr kelly victory doctor victory good morning great
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:55.600]  to talk to you as always good morning jason thanks for having me okay we want to make sure that
[2:06:55.600 --> 2:07:00.320]  anytime we talk we want to make sure the information that we have is accurate so let's start this
[2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:06.560]  interview by telling us i've seen your correspondence here what is the source of the information
[2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:14.320]  that you're about to present well this information became available to me or on my radar last week
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:20.480]  following a hearing with senator ron johnson uh who was looking at sort of what he calls a second
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:27.440]  opinion on the entire response to the covet pandemic the medical data was released by three
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:36.160]  career military physicians who got the information from the military database that collects what we
[2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:43.360]  call icd codes which are the diagnosis codes and these physicians had a feeling they believed
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:50.000]  based on their own observation that they were seeing a significant uptick in certain conditions
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:56.720]  so they actually went back and called the database from the military on certain conditions over a
[2:07:56.720 --> 2:08:08.320]  five-year period from 2016 through 2020 notably continue containing one year 2020 of the full
[2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:16.160]  blown pandemic so they looked at 2016 1718 19 and 20 at the prevalence of certain conditions
[2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:22.080]  including things like heart attack blood clots to the lung miscarriages those sorts of things
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:29.280]  and they compared it to the incidence of those same things in the calendar year 2021 and saw
[2:08:29.280 --> 2:08:36.560]  an alarming increase in certain things for example they saw a 270 percent increase in
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:44.480]  myocardial infarction in 2021 a 300 increase in incidence of Bell's palsy and of certain
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:52.960]  neurologic complaints a 470 percent increase in pulmonary embolisms blood clots to the lungs
[2:08:52.960 --> 2:08:59.840]  and many many other huge increases that they found alarming all right since she
[2:09:00.400 --> 2:09:06.080]  covered that on air she's been massively attacked but if you go to youtube almost every comment is
[2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:10.160]  on her side and the people are confirming what she said but it's in mainline studies
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:16.960]  Dr. Carlson was covering it last night uh their intimidation is not working she's a medical doctor
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:24.000]  and go over her old bio but Dr. Kelly victory joins us and so you're not censored you're live
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:28.560]  you can say whatever you want tell us about yourself your concerns you're not just talking
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:33.840]  for five minutes on you know San Diego TV here you you're reaching millions of people can really
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:40.080]  break down your concerns thank you so much for joining us well thanks so much for having me Alex
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:45.200]  I've still somewhat caught off guard when people reference me as you did as a quote whistleblower
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:52.080]  back in the olden days I'm what people would call an honest physician reporting on the facts and
[2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:58.240]  the science and the data as I interpret them uh from the beginning I have been really raising
[2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:06.240]  the alarm bells during this pandemic going really back to February of 2020 primarily because I saw
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:13.360]  a response that was totally out of line with what one would have expected from public health
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:21.040]  it began with things like talking about you know masking I mean these sorts of things and I sat back
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:26.800]  and said wait a minute you know we've known for decades that masks don't do anything appreciable
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:32.160]  to stop the spread of respiratory viruses why would they be talking about that and then it very
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:38.480]  quickly went on to things like social distancing perhaps my favorite made up construct of this
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:46.240]  entire debacle I have an entire library of books on public health epidemiology virology
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:53.280]  immunology pandemic preparedness and response and I defy anyone to go to any of those textbooks
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:59.840]  and find where the phrase social distancing appears in the index it's a yet we have mom and
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:05.680]  pop shops all over the country that we're putting up you know plexiglass and circles on the floor
[2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:13.040]  and one-way signs in the you know aisles at the Walmart so that was the initial thing that got my
[2:11:13.040 --> 2:11:19.920]  attention was what the heck are they talking about then I started talking very early about the
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:28.640]  vaccines and my concerns about the vaccines now suffice to say out I am not a hentai vaccine
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:35.600]  anything but I've actually been called a vaccine zealot in the past I have written and spoken
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:41.680]  much of my career in public health on the importance of vaccinations my concern was with
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:50.160]  these vaccines number one when they started talking about launching very quickly an mRNA vaccine I
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:56.240]  said wait a minute we have never had a safe and effective mRNA vaccine not because we haven't
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:12:03.440]  tried that technology has been around for well over a decade at the time yet the vaccines had
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:09.440]  always failed sometimes with disastrous results then I said wait a minute they're talking about
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:15.680]  a vaccine that's going to be predicated on a singular spike protein well that's not going to work
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:23.120]  anybody with any background in virology knows that viruses mutate all viruses mutate and the
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:30.160]  area most likely to mutate is that spike protein so if you create a vaccine based on that spike
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:35.200]  protein I simply predicted I said well this isn't going to work it's going to fail immediately
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:41.920]  independent of any severe adverse events you might have because of the mRNA this thing is going to
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  fail in a New York minute so I was out talking about all of this very very early on and unleashed
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:56.960]  a world of hurt on myself with regard to censorship I don't have a big or I didn't at the time a big
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:06.320]  social media presence whatsoever but I started receiving just unbelievable vitriol from people
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:11.600]  people were sending me not only personal notes but I was receiving you know many things in the
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:16.880]  mail people would get my address and send me things and talk about how I was a horrible human
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:21.360]  being and I was going to result in the deaths of you know hundreds of millions of people
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:28.080]  that I should lose my medical license and lo and behold I have had to defend my medical license
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:35.520]  on seven separate occasions during this pandemic I've done so successfully every time
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:40.000]  and I mean let's think about that though an unapproved drug rammed through on the public
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.880]  and a doctor questions it you've now been vindicated and the left doesn't want doctors
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:49.440]  questioning unapproved drugs rolled out I mean they've turned into like big pharma cult members
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:14:00.480]  exactly this is in the past we have absolutely promoted the idea of robust vigorous debate
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:06.800]  in medicine frankly it's a cornerstone of medicine respectful debate but robust and
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:13.760]  it's a cornerstone of science isn't it I mean it's all about debate absolutely we rarely come
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:18.880]  to the best decisions in medicine or science or frankly business or anything else if you
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:25.600]  only listen to a singular voice for years I was the chief medical officer of a company that ran
[2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:31.920]  on-site healthcare for huge companies fortune 100 companies and dozens of federal agencies
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:39.200]  incidentally and I had a plaque on my desk that said argue with me and I meant it tell me why this
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:44.720]  is the dumbest idea I've come up with or tell me why I'm misinterpreting the data tell me why
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:49.920]  I have overestimated oh that's what I say on air and and I wouldn't call them the left just these
[2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:55.280]  corporate bots they'll never debate on a face-to-face they only want it when it's their playing field
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:15:01.760]  period right and they don't debate on the science immediately they start hurling invectives and
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:08.720]  making ad hominem attacks it never has to do with them saying hey Dr Kelly we read that same study
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:14.320]  and here's where I think you misinterpreted the findings it's never about that it's you're a horrible
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:19.120]  human being and you need to go away you shouldn't be looking at the lands at journal saying it doesn't
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:26.080]  work and it raises the immune system just shut up exactly and so when I did that last little clip
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:32.640]  that you reported where I was talking about specifically that data that was revealed by
[2:15:32.640 --> 2:15:39.280]  three career military physicians who were looking at what they call dmed the defense military
[2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:46.800]  epidemiology database and they have access I don't I'm not a military physician but they have access
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:52.560]  to this enormous database that was very very helpful Dr Kelly I want to hear about what these
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:57.760]  military physicians said that they're trying to censor when we come back stay with us the cavalry

[2:20:38.480 --> 2:20:44.800]  yeah i just was talking um briefly about this issue of the data that was revealed by three
[2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:51.600]  career military physicians who were drawing attention to these very very alarming increases
[2:20:51.600 --> 2:20:57.200]  in the incidence of certain conditions things like blood clots to the long and bells palsy
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:04.160]  heart attacks strokes those sorts of things and was actually in posting that sworn testimony by
[2:21:04.160 --> 2:21:10.960]  these military physicians that got me permanently banned from from twitter how posting sworn
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:16.320]  testimony from a congressional hearing is misinformation is beyond me but that's the
[2:21:16.320 --> 2:21:22.080]  way it seems to go these days the thing that i think should be absolutely alarming and really
[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:30.400]  incense all americans alex is that the veirs system the vaccine adverse event reporting system
[2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:37.840]  has been in place for 24 years was specifically put there as an early warning system it was meant
[2:21:37.840 --> 2:21:45.200]  to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine uh the the cdc said let's put a system in place where
[2:21:45.200 --> 2:21:51.840]  people uh civilians and physicians can report things that might be adverse events related to
[2:21:51.840 --> 2:21:57.600]  a vaccine so that we'll know very very quickly early on we'll have that early warning sign and
[2:21:57.600 --> 2:22:03.040]  now their own system is showing 10 20 times previous record problems they say it's discredited
[2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:11.200]  correct they they not only haven't looked into it they have ignored it there are more
[2:22:11.200 --> 2:22:19.920]  adverse events and specifically more deaths attributed on veirs to the covid 19 vaccines
[2:22:19.920 --> 2:22:28.560]  than to all other vaccines combined over 24 years think about that say that again in its whole
[2:22:28.560 --> 2:22:35.520]  history there are more in the last two years than ever reported of all the vaccines all 30 other
[2:22:35.520 --> 2:22:42.480]  vaccines over the 24 year period combined you heard that correctly incredible now there's not
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:48.560]  there's no saying that any particular case that's reported to veirs is definitely a result of the
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:55.440]  vaccine but that's the way it's always been that's that's the nature of that system the the point
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:02.000]  is they need to be evaluated and well it's like if you feed your cows a bunch of a new feed and you
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:07.440]  got 100 cows and 10 die and normally one cow dies a year and 10 die in a day you know it's it's the
[2:23:07.440 --> 2:23:14.320]  feed i mean it's it's cause and effect it's right there exactly and and so the the great news is
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:21.040]  or should have been for for americans is that there's an organization whose job it is to look into that
[2:23:21.040 --> 2:23:26.800]  and it's called the cdc they haven't done it they not only haven't looked into some of them
[2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:32.480]  they haven't looked into any of these they haven't done the autopsies they haven't called the data
[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:38.960]  instead they've turned a blind eye to it and they march out on a daily basis and say safe
[2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:46.160]  and effective safe and effective when they know darn well that it is neither safe nor effective
[2:23:46.160 --> 2:23:53.360]  and the idea that they are coming out now and making some sort of disingenuous mea culpa about
[2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:57.680]  the fact that they didn't let me stop you doctor because you're reading my mind my next question is
[2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:02.960]  what do you make of berks and fouchy and all of them saying oh we never thought it would work
[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:10.160]  what is that about oh they're saying the quiet part out loud all of the sudden they're acknowledging
[2:24:10.160 --> 2:24:18.240]  the reality uh deborah berks has come flat out and said they knew from the beginning uh as i did
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:24.800]  that the vaccines wouldn't work that they would lose effectiveness very very quickly uh and again
[2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:32.080]  that is independent and well let's see the head of the cdc oh yes she has come out and she has said
[2:24:32.080 --> 2:24:37.200]  just recently yeah well whoops we made some mistakes and now we're going to do better going
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:43.920]  forward because we're going to focus on quote communication collaboration and timeliness
[2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:51.600]  um i truly alex they should focus on competence and integrity and perhaps some humility that would
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:56.160]  be a more compelling trifecta well i totally agree so basically they got rid of three fda boards as
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:00.000]  they wouldn't approve this they've got a bunch of executives involved with the companies making
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:04.880]  money off of it the big question is why were they so psychotic to even try this and now
[2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:11.440]  it's all coming out doctor victory where do you see this going well unfortunately there
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:18.160]  it is going to take us decades alex to really understand the damage done by this pandemic
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:24.720]  debacle it there are so many areas as i said it's not just the vaccines that's a huge piece
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:31.040]  and we won't likely know literally for decades what the fallout is there's a reason that the
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:38.720]  average vaccine takes six to eight years to come to market if it ever makes it at all these vaccines
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:44.640]  had a paucity of safety data behind them when they started they were never tested on pregnant women
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:49.840]  lactating women people with autoimmune diseases or people who'd already had and recovered from
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:57.200]  covid we have really no idea what the long-term neurologic impact is the impact on uh reproductive
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:05.040]  health and on and on furthermore we have done untold damage to an entire generation of young
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:11.280]  people who were forced to wear masks socially distanced miss two and a half years of school
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:18.320]  there's a reason for example that toddlers have significant speech delay the cdc rather than
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:23.840]  acknowledging that wearing masks and being around you know throngs and others wearing masks rather
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:30.560]  than acknowledging the profoundly negative impact that has had on young children they simply went on
[2:26:30.560 --> 2:26:37.280]  quietly and unceremoniously and changed the childhood the milestones for the number of
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:43.920]  words for example that a toddler should know and be able to say by the age of 24 or 30 months
[2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:50.000]  children learn to speak by mimicking mouth movements not by what they hear so the fact
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:56.880]  that we've had people masked for two and a half years has had a huge impact these things it is so
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:04.320]  deep it's going to take us a long long time and unfortunately perhaps the greatest tragedy of it
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:12.400]  all is that it is absolutely undermined the faith and confidence that people have in public health
[2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:18.080]  god help us when the next thing comes along because there will be a next thing i can't tell
[2:27:18.080 --> 2:27:24.960]  you what it will be but we will need to get the attention and the buy-in of the american people
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:31.840]  and the population globally to listen to what we have to say and to pay heed and right now the
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:38.000]  average person looks at public health and says you're a bunch of incompetent buffoons because
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.960]  well doctor victory i mean i couldn't say it better you're saying it better than i could i mean
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:47.600]  they're admitting the next things coming this is big pharma taking over you don't want to
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:53.120]  speculate but clearly pulling back worldwide responses coordinated we have operation lock step
[2:27:53.120 --> 2:27:59.200]  the whole thing was organized oh there's no question and i will you know wax i am not a
[2:27:59.200 --> 2:28:06.800]  conspiracy theorist but i can connect the dots the reality is that people like bill gates have
[2:28:06.800 --> 2:28:13.760]  wanted for a long long time to create a universal vaccine platform in the name of you know named
[2:28:13.760 --> 2:28:21.200]  mrna uh there's no question that much of what they did was a you know a sigh up to see exactly how
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:28.560]  much people would tolerate just how quickly will people hand over their civil liberties on a platter
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:37.040]  in the name of public health fear itself fears an incredibly powerful intoxicant is a very good
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:43.120]  way to manipulate people i teach a course on leadership and times of crisis and if i had to
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:51.280]  summarize that entire seminar it's you know learn to recognize abject fear and terror and get yourself
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:55.680]  out of it because you don't make good decisions that's right stay there dr kelly victory let's
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:29:03.200]  talk more about just look at these headlines from roiders world faces unprecedented global hunger

[2:31:02.480 --> 2:31:08.800]  foundations of our republic i wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name in fact
[2:31:08.800 --> 2:31:16.720]  i bet it does i bet it's called operation matador they see us as the bull and they are shaky a red
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:24.880]  flag in our face and the matador is the deep state with a long skinny razor shark sword so that when
[2:31:24.880 --> 2:31:31.040]  the bull lunges forward the matador uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step
[2:31:31.040 --> 2:31:36.480]  aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust they've got the ace of spades in
[2:31:36.480 --> 2:31:41.920]  their hand which is false flags before you launch a war you stage false flags that's the first day
[2:31:41.920 --> 2:31:47.440]  you do because nobody wants to say they started a war bad guys start wars so every time a war
[2:31:47.440 --> 2:31:52.720]  gets launched by bad guys they stage an event this is operation matador
[2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:02.000]  i don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer a rancher a doctor
[2:32:02.000 --> 2:32:07.040]  a lawyer or a millionaire fortune and money magazine have all done these profiles you see it
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:11.920]  every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different
[2:32:11.920 --> 2:32:17.600]  answers and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and and the big
[2:32:17.600 --> 2:32:22.080]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:26.880]  this and knowing this so it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things
[2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:33.440]  out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows
[2:32:33.440 --> 2:32:37.600]  you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here if i hadn't gotten great tax advice
[2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:44.800]  in the last few years the only way you fail is not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com

[2:33:03.840 --> 2:33:20.400]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:40.160]  everywhere i go all right well i'm really impressed with medical doctor kelly victory
[2:33:40.800 --> 2:33:45.360]  and we got cut off by a break a lot of folks are watching right now and i want to take part
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:50.880]  of this interview tomorrow and and play it again it's so powerful powerful early cobancare.org
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:56.880]  i said connecting the doc's big picture the premeditation of operation lockstep all the
[2:33:56.880 --> 2:34:01.200]  documents you said absolutely you're sort of going through that so start over again
[2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:05.920]  and and spend some time on that because they're saying new lockdowns coming new viruses coming
[2:34:06.560 --> 2:34:11.040]  they admit this shot didn't work erasure your immune system all that big picture what do you
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:15.520]  expect to come next and and speak to what you were just talking about about this being premeditated
[2:34:15.520 --> 2:34:22.400]  what's your view on that well early on i have to say early on i did not believe that i said no
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:29.120]  i i i you know i can't possibly connect those dots i think you'd be hard pressed at this point alex
[2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:34.080]  to not understand that there's something else bigger going on whether you want to say it's the
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:41.600]  great reset uh or simply look at the fact that people like bill gates uh george soros the people
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:46.960]  at the world economic forum and others they clearly believe that the world that the globe
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:55.040]  would benefit it would benefit significantly from a large decrease in the population uh and again i
[2:34:55.040 --> 2:35:02.080]  say that not um because i believed it initially but when you watch the behavior it is simply not
[2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:08.960]  conceivable that these people are just that incompetent there is a nefarious intent here
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:14.640]  you have people at the helm not just in the united states but elsewhere who have continued to push
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:20.800]  and push and push for example on these vaccines let's talk about that there's global coordination
[2:35:20.800 --> 2:35:28.400]  blocking therapeutics uh early studies from the cdc predicting the bad side effects talk about that
[2:35:29.360 --> 2:35:34.080]  yes absolutely and you take um there were studies that were you know white table
[2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:40.880]  exercises on things like you know what would happen if we had a pandemic of this sort um these
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:46.160]  guys have known from the beginning whether it's masking social distancing um talking about the
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:53.120]  idea of asymptomatic spread testing people who are asymptomatic these sorts of things are absolutely
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:59.440]  not based in the science and they have to have known that asymptomatic people have never been
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:06.000]  the spreaders of of uh a pandemic or of a respiratory virus masks have never worked
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:12.560]  social distancing as i said earlier we've known for decades that lockdowns do far more damage
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:18.400]  um than good and there's a reason why we haven't used them in the past we've known
[2:36:18.400 --> 2:36:24.400]  from the beginning that children frankly healthy people under the age of 50 but certainly people
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:30.960]  under the age of 18 were at such a de minimis risk from this virus as to be indistinguishable
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:38.800]  from zero yet they applied with a broad brush these mandates to everyone they acted as if
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:44.400]  everyone was at equivalent risk when they knew from the beginning that that was not the case
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:51.520]  and you see them doing it again with monkeypox all of the sudden we're going to act as if
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:58.960]  everyone is at equivalent risk when we know up front who the risk groups are with covid
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:04.960]  it clearly was the elderly and when i say that i mean people really over the age of 75 or 80
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:11.600]  and people with a very well known set of comorbidities specifically obesity diabetes and heart
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:18.640]  disease yet they acted as if everyone was at risk everybody must distance and lock down and stay
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:24.720]  home and bathe in purel and hide in fear in the basement they're doing the same thing interestingly
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:32.000]  with monkeypox we know who's at risk from monkeypox we know that it's not the average individual
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:38.560]  we know that 95 percent of the people getting monkeypox identify as men and that more than 95
[2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:47.440]  percent are homosexual or or transgender transsexual and and therefore those are the risk groups
[2:37:47.440 --> 2:37:52.560]  but instead we're going to act as if you know suburban housewives and people who aren't sexually
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:57.600]  active and young children are at risk they always go against the logic it's like an exercise against
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:04.000]  logic well you know and they they there's a part of it that's just being so politically correct
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:10.960]  you know we need the equity has no place in public health okay unfortunately viruses don't
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:17.680]  know equity viruses know who their targets are and we don't do anybody any good as public health
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:25.360]  experts to call it any other way the only way we can protect those people who are truly at risk
[2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:32.000]  whether it's from covid or tuberculosis or monkeypox is to actually acknowledge who the
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:38.320]  risk groups are put our resources towards those risk groups you know one of the the greatest
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:45.440]  failures of this pandemic and that's a long list from which to choose but one of the greatest
[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:52.640]  failures was their failure to acknowledge the the role the mandate alex of public health
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:59.440]  is to look at the impact of any particular mitigation scheme on the entire public not
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:05.600]  a single individual not a single disease process it's very different from when you come to see me
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:11.760]  in the emergency department or in my office at that time that's a one-on-one interaction
[2:39:11.760 --> 2:39:18.880]  and you are my sole concern when i put on my public health hat it's very different i have to look at
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:26.560]  the impact on the entire population and not just their physical health also their spiritual health
[2:39:26.560 --> 2:39:33.680]  mental health economic health so they should have known from the beginning what a lockdown
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:39.440]  would do and they knew it and it was all a giant a giant milgram experiment uh to basically divide
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:44.320]  in congress society you give us your view as a medical doctor for the psychology of this thing
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:50.640]  well and if you listen by the way to debra berks and others who freely acknowledges in her book
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.520]  that they had to be surreptitious they had to be very careful quote unquote to not let their
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:02.400]  true intentions be known these are her words not mine she knew they knew that if they acknowledged
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:07.760]  what they intended which was never simply a two week lockdown you know two weeks to flatten the
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:13.280]  curve that was never their intention as berks acknowledges in the book they knew if they'd
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:20.080]  said that however to trump being the businessman that he was that he would understand the profoundly
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:24.640]  negative impact that's right so so why are they now writing books and giving speeches
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:30.880]  taddling on themselves to create a new narrative that was all you know the the noble lie or what
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:36.640]  was it yes i think it's i think it's in part that and i frankly you know the rats are jumping ship
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:43.200]  uh anthony fouchie up and you know put turned in his notice uh he's going to be stepping down as of
[2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:48.560]  december you know three and a half decades too late but nonetheless he's finally stepping down
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:56.480]  and i think he intends to try to get out of dodge and slink into the shadows uh before there's
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:02.000]  likely a republican call to to have his head and to be hauling him in front of congress
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:08.480]  um depending on what happens in november many of them are trying desperately to get on the right
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:14.000]  side of history um they are trying to hitch their wagon and say oh yes we always knew i know i did
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:20.160]  this because i said this because it was in the best interest of the population but we always knew
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:26.720]  they're trying very hard to rewrite history i do not think that history will treat them kindly
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:32.880]  however uh and there's a long list of people who are complicit in this certainly fouchie's right
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:41.120]  at the top of that list um he was participant let's not forget in actually creating this thing
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:49.440]  called covid he absolutely funneled us taxpayer dollars uh through eco health alliance and peter
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:56.880]  dayzak to the wuhan lab in china for gain of function research uh one of the only things i truly
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:04.960]  agreed with president obama on was the moratorium that was put on in 2014 to gain of function
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:11.520]  research it was recognized as very very dangerous certainly something that could potentially create
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:17.280]  a super bug and now the idea and now he's purging himself to congress stay right there final segment
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:24.240]  very impressed kelly victory md i want to talk about big picture and and where we're going next
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:29.600]  the facts of the rats are leaving the sinking ship what does that signify early covered care
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:36.560]  dot o r g kelly victory md on getter wow so he knows what she is talking about that's why the

[2:47:46.640 --> 2:47:52.480]  based on my experience and you'll see that in a moment is that there is no question that there
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:58.640]  will be a challenge the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic
[2:47:58.640 --> 2:48:03.360]  infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have certainly a large
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:07.200]  burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:16.320]  md doctor telly victory is our guest you got caught up by the break again
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:19.200]  covering critical information please continue doctor
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:26.800]  well just talking about you know really really where this is going alex because i think that's
[2:48:26.800 --> 2:48:32.400]  what most people want to know you know fauci stepping down many of them are stepping down
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:39.120]  fauci isn't going away though i can guarantee it he will pop up somewhere else likely either
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:45.600]  at the bill and melinda gates foundation the who or somewhere else in a word about the who
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:53.920]  by the way the who to be very clear there's a reason why we stepped out of it previously
[2:48:53.920 --> 2:48:59.600]  uh with president trump the who is essentially the long arm of the chinese communist party
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:07.280]  dr tedros uh not a who's not a medical doctor by the way dr tedros who runs the who
[2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:13.600]  was handpicked by the chinese communist party and he has a very different agenda the idea
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:20.480]  that fauci and others were involved not only in doing gain of function research uh that is
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:26.880]  very very dangerous but they were doing it with our greatest geopolitical foe china they were doing
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:33.600]  it in wuhan and there's no question that this was a lab created virus and the idea that anyone is
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:39.920]  suggesting that it was that it still is a naturally occurring uh virus is preposterous uh you need
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:46.000]  only look at the genetics of that particular virus to know it was lab manipulated whether it was
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:53.680]  released purposefully or out of abject incompetence i cannot say but lab created i can and there's no
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:50:02.160]  question anthony fauci's fingerprints are all over that so is the who so uh clearly people are
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:08.240]  making billions of dollars off of this pandemic and they stand to make billions of dollars from
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:15.600]  the next fear fest um whether it's a resurgence of polio or monkey pox or whatever else but i
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:23.120]  think that this has been as i said a sigh up not that the virus itself wasn't real uh covid was very
[2:50:23.120 --> 2:50:31.440]  real and unfortunately many people died unnecessarily because of the therapeutic nihilism that occurred
[2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:38.400]  and the refusal of the powers that be to even allow us to talk about this safe effective
[2:50:38.400 --> 2:50:44.560]  readily available medications that we have to treat covid we had them from the beginning
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:51.440]  things like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and steroids for the duration of the pandemic
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:57.520]  the people who are supposedly the gurus of public health have failed to tell people about the
[2:50:57.520 --> 2:51:03.840]  importance of supplementing vitamin d and zinc two of the least expensive and simplest ways
[2:51:03.840 --> 2:51:09.760]  we could have prevented people from dying from not only covid but a heck of a lot of other viruses
[2:51:09.760 --> 2:51:15.120]  that are out there yet they haven't focused on that because their concern isn't really public
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:22.320]  health at all it's control it's gaining control of you your children your business and where you
[2:51:22.320 --> 2:51:30.000]  work this is the fundamental of a totalitarian society make it as miserable as possible so you
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:36.320]  will finally break down and say okay i'll do whatever it is you want if you'll just make it stop
[2:51:36.320 --> 2:51:42.960]  just make it go away and they hand you back some little bit of freedom something that
[2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:47.760]  months ago you would have considered your god given right and something they had no right
[2:51:47.760 --> 2:51:55.200]  to take away in the first place we've got a lot of work to do alex to rebuild and undo the damage
[2:51:55.200 --> 2:52:02.320]  that was done by this pandemic and this pandemic response it's not just the physical components
[2:52:02.320 --> 2:52:08.560]  and the the tremendous adverse events that are going to continue to happen as a result of these
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:16.000]  vaccines but it's really the psychological damage the economic damage the social damage
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:21.840]  the fractionation of families and friends over this issue of whether or not you wore a mask or
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:28.400]  took the dang vaccine or whatever else we've got a lot of work to do all right i only learned about
[2:52:28.400 --> 2:52:33.440]  you from this clip i've looked you up medical doctor great past great history i'm very impressed
[2:52:33.440 --> 2:52:39.520]  i've had a lot of amazing people dr mercola mercola uh you know we've had so many other top
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:45.680]  people on i know you're already prominent but man we need to get you out front and center
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:52.800]  i think you're one of the most coherent cogent full spectrum doctors out there tell us people
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:58.000]  know about you a little bit about yourself who you are and how people can contact you and how
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:03.200]  people can support the great work you're doing doctor well thank you very much for this platform
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:07.760]  too as i said it's been a tough time with the amount of censorship i am a trauma and emergency
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:13.440]  physician by training i practiced hospital based trauma medicine for years and then developed an
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:20.960]  interest in mass casualty and in disaster preparedness and response i ran the healthcare
[2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:26.080]  for companies and their employees and their families for many many years i happened to have
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:33.920]  been at the helm at continental airlines during the sars covet one pandemic in 2003 so have some
[2:53:33.920 --> 2:53:40.720]  some pandemic experience as well i did postgraduate training at the harvard school of public health
[2:53:41.520 --> 2:53:47.760]  and and really have spent the last 20 years primarily teaching i still see patients but
[2:53:47.760 --> 2:53:53.120]  teaching and training in everything from active shooter preparedness and response
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:54:00.400]  to this whole issue of leadership in times of crisis god knows we need more people at the helm
[2:54:00.400 --> 2:54:08.720]  during these events and people who are not afraid to speak openly and honestly we do know in any
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:15.040]  favors by sugarcoating the truth on the other hand as i said fear is not a way to lead people
[2:54:15.040 --> 2:54:23.360]  um out of the basement uh i have a website with a number of other terrific physicians not only
[2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:30.160]  storied people with storied academic careers but stellar human beings people like doctors
[2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:37.040]  peter mccullough and harvey reish paul alexander george beread and that website is early covet
[2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:44.480]  care dot org um it's a great website because it's a repository for a huge number of studies
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:50.080]  if you're interested in what i'm talking about with regard to studies for example on masks or
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:56.240]  social distancing or information about the vaccines we have hundreds and hundreds of
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:55:02.960]  published scientific studies there there are resources for people with regard to protocols to
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:10.160]  treat covet as well as covet vaccine injuries and a way to avail yourself of of telemedicine
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:18.960]  services if you need to talk with a physician um my only real social media platform right now
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:24.640]  is on getter having been permanently banned from from twitter i chose not to fight that
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:29.760]  ban by the way it simply wasn't worth it i'm not interested in participating in a propaganda
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:37.680]  platform um so i'm on getter at kelly victory md uh and i spend really some time doing shows like
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:45.120]  this one and again i so appreciate the platform because people deserve to be able to hear this
[2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:52.480]  i am was the the lead co-defendant and the lead i go excuse me co plaintiff uh the co plaintiff
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:59.120]  with um president trump in his class action lawsuit against big tech and again it's not
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:06.480]  because it's a an affront to my first amendment right to speak it's more an affront to the right
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:14.000]  of all americans to hear to hear the other sides um i believe that people are smart enough that they
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:18.800]  can take the information they can distill it and they can come to the best decisions for
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:24.880]  themselves and their families it's not anybody's right to prevent you from getting all of the
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:30.960]  information if people want to argue with me as i said bring it on happy to argue but let's argue
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:36.800]  about the facts no i totally agree well doctor victory usually they say don't judge a book off
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.960]  its cover and i actually now that we're talking to you i've seen some other big stuff you're
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:45.120]  involved in but like seeing the newscast having you here it's amazing you're a great american
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:49.440]  you're an amazing doctor you're a wonderful woman and we're so much stronger to have you here and
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:53.840]  you just knocked out of the park hope everybody takes the archive of this interview today it'll
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:59.040]  be a band-aid video and i hope they share it thank you so much for your time and i think it's fair
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:05.040]  to say though they expect a lot more out of this power grab they they got a lot but not what they

[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:28.880]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:37.280]  all right i have a special guest joining us next segment right now we're taking your phone calls
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:45.120]  all in florida you're on the air welcome hey alex welcome hey so i just wanted to bring up a key
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:52.320]  pieces of information that i think was overlooked by the sandy hook trial um so still to today fbi.gov
[3:00:52.320 --> 3:01:00.320]  has the uniform crime report and if you look up sandy hook kinesia in 2012 it still says zero murders
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:08.160]  and manslaughter in that category so the fbi confirms that nobody died at sandy hook in
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:15.840]  connecticut 2012 even if you go to 2013 because it happened in december still it's a big goose egg
[3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:23.840]  nobody died this is very specific information from the fbi confirming nobody died in samuels
[3:01:23.840 --> 3:01:31.680]  yeah no that that actually was brought up during the so-called uh kangaroo trial and the thing is
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:36.880]  they say the state of connecticut doesn't report deaths of the fbi doesn't put them in there but
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:41.360]  that's why people are asking questions one of the reasons i appreciate your call uh let's go
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:49.120]  ahead and talk to erin in wisconsin erin go ahead hey jones i just wanted to talk about
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:54.960]  something i saw on friday evening i was watching one fighting championships at the mix martial arts
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:00.640]  promotion out of asia and they had their first event on amazon and one of their main sponsors
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:08.000]  even on the page for their uh the one fc website is globalcitizen.org and naturally you know being a
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:13.760]  viewer of your show this kind of struck a chord so i went to the site to check it out and you can go
[3:02:13.760 --> 3:02:19.200]  and look and read all these wonderful articles like five ways our lives would include i'm sorry
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:25.840]  improved in a circular economy and this is called swabs you'll own nothing you'll be happy about it
[3:02:25.840 --> 3:02:31.840]  and this article goes on to say how the world bank estimates that americans produce all this waste
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:38.320]  and you know what they don't say is this is how they've set the system up so this is how we this
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:44.720]  is how we behave this is how we act and now it's all our fault they kind of sidestep blame it's
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:50.080]  everything that you're always talking about that they built up this system for us to be in and now
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:55.920]  they use that as the reason why they need to get all of us under control we're all dangerous you
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:03:01.360]  know all the all throughout history that that's what the elites have said that 95 of us are dangerous
[3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:09.280]  to ourselves and into the future of the human race and also i was listening to uh richard grove
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:16.480]  interview john taylor gato the ultimate history lesson are you familiar with that yes and i mean
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:22.800]  this i would recommend that people go and listen to this it's five hours full of everything from
[3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:28.480]  the history of public education in this country and how we're just kind of set up to fail and
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:34.400]  and i believe that if you can learn this you can kind of get out ahead of it and you can you can learn
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:40.960]  to get out of this way of thinking and actually you know make some real change and act some real
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:47.680]  change in our own lives and to try to prevent or mitigate some of what these people are are trying
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:53.600]  to do to us you know the world economic forum all the usual suspects so that's about it that go
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:58.320]  check out that global citizen dot org they're just kind of stuffing it down our throat every everywhere
[3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:01.280]  they can oh and they just announced world government we're getting rid of the humans we're
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:04.880]  going to cut your resources off to bring into your knees i mean that's what's so frustrating is
[3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:12.000]  this thing is out in the open thank you erin all right joining us is a very special guest dr
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:18.400]  lee merit the medical rebel dot com she's been massively centered she's a medical doctor predicting
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:22.640]  everything that's unfolded and now we have government submitting nine out of ten people
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:30.160]  that are dying of covid have been double or triple or quadruple vax this is so huge and then after she
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:35.440]  leaves us i'm going to go ahead and just host fourth hour after she leaves us i'm going to hit
[3:04:35.440 --> 3:04:42.240]  trump calling for a new election massive news trump's response to us my old demand
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:46.960]  without coming out against the vax and these drag queen pedophile story times and the big
[3:04:46.960 --> 3:04:55.280]  developments in texas it's all coming up today info wars dot com stay with us
[3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:03.200]  so many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:09.360]  male vitality is incredible why does it work so well and the answer is very simple it takes from
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:15.360]  chinese medicine and other ancient traditions known herbal compounds that boost libido
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:22.800]  stamina and energy and it comes from cold pressed herbs so they're not boiling or heating up the
[3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:29.280]  herbs that are known to have these natural effects it's cold pressed it's been sold out for eight
[3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:37.120]  months or more it's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com for 25 off super male vitality
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:43.280]  and it goes great with x2 which is also 25 off but if you get both these products together
[3:05:43.280 --> 3:05:51.680]  they're 40 off in a combo at infowarstore.com so x2 and super male vitality 40 off together
[3:05:51.680 --> 3:05:56.800]  are 25 off individually at infowarstore.com it's amazing try it today
[3:06:01.040 --> 3:06:06.640]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow
[3:06:06.640 --> 3:06:14.480]  i hear people talking about the way we have to live here in this country
[3:06:16.480 --> 3:06:22.880]  harping on wars be fine dr. lee merritt for two and a half years has been exposing covid as a
[3:06:22.880 --> 3:06:29.280]  lab made product and she's been exposing the deadly shots she is now completely and totally
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:34.160]  absolutely vindicated in triplicate i'm going to go over some of the big developments
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:38.320]  that have just unfolded but i just want to out of the gates go right to her
[3:06:38.960 --> 3:06:44.320]  to talk about the state of the world and what's coming next she's got a dna strand behind her
[3:06:44.320 --> 3:06:50.960]  if you're a tv viewer and they're now announcing that these dna swabs these covid tests we took
[3:06:52.240 --> 3:06:55.360]  at universities and medical centers and you name it were actually sent
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:07:03.440]  to a dna database got a big stack of news on that this is part of a massive globalist takeover
[3:07:03.440 --> 3:07:07.520]  there is no doubt so so dr. lee merritt thanks for having us on why don't you give folks the
[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:12.480]  35 000 foot view then we'll zoom in with the microscope and look at the specifics
[3:07:14.480 --> 3:07:21.200]  well uh the 30 000 foot view may be a quote from eggurellen po that i i've become insane
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:26.880]  with long intervals of horrible sanity it just seems like every time we turn around it gets more
[3:07:26.880 --> 3:07:34.000]  confusing um you know the real issue is there is this really even a genetic war i've had this dna
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:40.080]  strand behind me but you know we're we're not finding dna in the vials of of these vaccines
[3:07:40.720 --> 3:07:47.680]  i think what if the in the real quick summary of this i think there's a lot of um misdirection
[3:07:47.680 --> 3:07:52.800]  and i think they've got us looking one way when we need to be really looking at another way and
[3:07:52.800 --> 3:07:57.920]  that's wavelength um we talked about it on the show here a long time ago about the implication
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:05.760]  of 5g but i honestly i didn't realize how you know i still thought there were viruses and dna
[3:08:05.760 --> 3:08:10.880]  was like i was taught now i'm not sure no no they know it's not blood clots it's artificial
[3:08:10.880 --> 3:08:15.680]  circuitry confirmed by hundreds of prestigious universities you name it growing in the body
[3:08:15.680 --> 3:08:22.320]  it's just causing blood clots right and i have to say the one thing i can be absolutely sure of
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:27.840]  and your previous caller brought this up is that schools have failed us but it wasn't by accident
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:33.040]  you know a lack of knowledge you have a you have mark pass you on here every once in a while and i
[3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:38.240]  really like mark pass you but he has a two-hour excellent excellent everybody should watch this
[3:08:38.240 --> 3:08:46.480]  um video on on demystifying the occult and occult just means hidden and i will tell you that they've
[3:08:46.480 --> 3:08:52.960]  hidden so much from us that is very hard to get a handle on what is true that's really our problem
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:09:00.960]  well that's right so so dive right into it dr merit well you know um i the thing that came
[3:09:00.960 --> 3:09:05.920]  first of all there's been some issues of just you know the whole genetic thing what's really
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:11.600]  going on here it's a couple things didn't make sense like um you know in 2017 i know that
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:18.480]  that they had a they they they were doing these hygiene therapies and we've been spending three
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:23.840]  billion dollars in genetics research every year but for that only about three percent actually goes
[3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:30.560]  to anything real any anything used in medicine now they claim that they've made a genetic vaccine
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:35.840]  here that goes out in the whole world but i looked it up the cost of a genetic therapy in 2017
[3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:42.160]  the one that they kind of tout as being the the the prototype it was somewhere between 800 000
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:48.240]  and a million dollars now something isn't ringing right here how can they then just suddenly within
[3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:53.760]  a couple years make this so cost effective they can do a gene treatment the genetic based
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:10:00.400]  therapy on the whole world there's something not right here and then you have um you know i also
[3:10:00.400 --> 3:10:07.360]  uh feng zhang of the zhang lab at mit now he has a he has a he's a he's what they call a
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:13.360]  bio biological engineer he's got a phd in biological engineering which is a little creepy
[3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:19.680]  but he's always cited as being one of the premier genetic manipulators having been the pioneer of
[3:10:19.680 --> 3:10:25.520]  crisper but you know if you go on his site and you actually read what it says it says that he
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:30.720]  else quoted it says although we typically talk about gene editing in reality we mostly do gene
[3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:38.880]  deleting our ability to precisely integrate new stretches of dna is limited so and then the final
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:45.760]  issue here is i interviewed dr. porna mawag you may have seen a small snippet of her on the internet
[3:10:45.760 --> 3:10:51.840]  but on my rumble i've got a two hour video so people can really watch and hear her for themselves so
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:10:58.160]  they get the understanding because there are 18 lab researchers she's a phd in virology there's
[3:10:58.160 --> 3:11:03.280]  there are labs researchers all over the world that have come up and said there is no genetic
[3:11:03.280 --> 3:11:10.000]  material in this in these vaccines and that's not one that is going to be too mushy mushy that's one
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:17.200]  of those things where we understand um you know electrophoresis gel electrophoresis it's a simple
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:23.440]  way of separating molecules if it's there we would have seen they should have seen it secondly
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:28.960]  we have a technique called the ramen spectroscopy so i'm i'm telling you they really looked at this
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:36.800]  that also can be very precise at looking at molecules using their um their refraction i
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:42.480]  guess using laser light so they did not find genetic material in these vials of vaccine and
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:47.680]  they looked at they looked at the sputnik they looked at sign of fact they looked at all of
[3:11:47.680 --> 3:11:53.920]  these different words well didn't they didn't they just simply find outside material that cuts
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:59.440]  dna like you said they're not manipulating dna they're cutting dna that causes mutation and cancer
[3:12:00.720 --> 3:12:08.160]  well they're doing something and the question is is it really genetic based um so what they're
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:15.600]  what they found in the vaccines so far and this is labs in germany india all over um they found
[3:12:16.640 --> 3:12:21.680]  they're all the same they say the vaccines are all the same they're a basis of hydrogel with
[3:12:22.640 --> 3:12:30.160]  reduced graphene oxide and then they've got a variety of metals in it now you know the one
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:36.640]  thing i can tell you for sure about graphene oxide is it is not safe you know you look at it and
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:44.160]  yes it has a lot of potential they say a lot of potential for for all sorts of interventions
[3:12:44.160 --> 3:12:51.040]  into humans the problem is it really has lots and lots of problems and and if you think about it
[3:12:51.040 --> 3:12:56.720]  it does a lot of the things that we're seeing the clotting the neurologic damage it's been it's been
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:13:03.840]  shown to to um you know give you abnormal immune responses i mean and and so you're saying is it's
[3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:08.640]  a big mystery all these labs around the world have found it's triggering the body not just what
[3:13:08.640 --> 3:13:14.880]  they inject but using your own body's chemicals to start growing these these these complexes
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:19.120]  inside the body we know that's happening the question is what is it for and why do they have
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:25.680]  all four vaccines that were backed by the NIH to cause this right again because they're all the same
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:30.560]  essentially and they their their purpose was never let's just keep in mind we also have to
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:34.800]  have a correct worldview that they were never here to help us this has never been about
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:39.760]  making anybody's safety if you look at the tragedy of the child vaccine program uh
[3:13:39.760 --> 3:13:43.680]  they're they've they've increased your doctor you're gonna have the floor when we come back
[3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:47.760]  i'm gonna think i'm gonna let you out so i'm just sit back and turn my mic off but pulling back to
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:52.320]  at the 30 000 foot view as i said you don't want to extrapolate you know give your opinion but
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:58.720]  clearly you're a smart lady what is this really about building capacitors into us changing the
[3:13:58.720 --> 3:14:01.920]  live form because that's what claus wobb says we're going to go in your bodies we're going to
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:05.520]  change who you are we're going to make you be ready to interface with machines and it looks
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:10.000]  like that's what this does and a bunch of people are going to be killed in the process i think
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:15.520]  that's pretty close to the to write on and i think they're using the graphene somehow to as a
[3:14:15.520 --> 3:14:22.640]  transformative agent in other words it can it can transform gigahertz to terahertz to run nanobots
[3:14:22.640 --> 3:14:28.560]  it's an it's an electrical receptacle so they're putting a receptor in for nanobots and electromagnetic
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:34.720]  energy yeah and 5g will coordinate it that's why they need five so to dumb it down they're putting
[3:14:34.720 --> 3:14:40.000]  the plug into us they're they're putting the interface in yeah anybody that says oh they're
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:44.560]  going to put a chip in you that's old news they don't need a chip all they need is this microscopic
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:49.920]  system injected over time i don't think the good news is i don't think they can do it in one piece
[3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:53.680]  and you've all heard already said that he said we're going to put nanotech in you to interface
[3:14:54.880 --> 3:14:58.960]  yep i think that's what it is i don't think it has it doesn't have any other
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:04.320]  if they look if they wanted to just kill us outright they could have done that a long time ago
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:09.040]  we know that i mean there's so many technologies out there that are just completely world busting
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:14.320]  technologies uh you know tess tesla's death ray but they're but that's not what they're doing
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:19.920]  they're they're doing this to um first of all i think they love our misery there's somebody out
[3:15:19.920 --> 3:15:24.880]  there that just feeds on our misery but because it's just been horrible experience right but the
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:29.360]  second thing is they're going to take away some of our population we saw the guide stones and they're
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:35.520]  going to transform people look what's you know if anybody's seen westworld what what's westworld
[3:15:35.520 --> 3:15:40.480]  really telling us it says there are people that look like us that talk like us that walk like us
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:47.280]  this is the protagonist said this but they're not us and what's if you look at that show the new
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:53.280]  westworld it shows that they for every robot that are synthetic they have to make a lot of they have
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:15:59.040]  to have a lot of humans tending it stay right there we brought the game changing product previously
[3:15:59.040 --> 3:16:03.760]  only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market two years ago
[3:16:03.760 --> 3:16:10.640]  the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for rvs for your drains your boats it goes on and on
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:16.480]  it'll eat the oil off of your driveway you just add water but it's been so successful now we're
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:23.760]  selling it to major rv parks uh pig farms you name it because this stuff will eat anything
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:31.040]  that is organic and it's exclusively available at the bio pros dot com and now info war store
[3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:37.840]  dot com we sold out of this for almost a year but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock
[3:16:37.840 --> 3:16:42.480]  for whatever your need is at info war store dot com you'll also find instructional videos
[3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:50.000]  more information at info war store dot com or the bio pros dot com made america powered by god's
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:57.520]  great creation it is amazing and it funds the info war ladies and gentlemen if millions of people
[3:16:57.520 --> 3:17:02.000]  get this book our funding problems will be over and it's starting to happen that's why i said yeah
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:05.680]  go to info war store dot com get the book and start shipping in a couple weeks the great reset in the
[3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:10.800]  war for the world but i said go to amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world and
[3:17:10.800 --> 3:17:15.440]  if it goes to number one not a political not of history not of us history it's already number one
[3:17:15.440 --> 3:17:21.840]  over 40 categories like political science you name it 40 plus categories it's number one ladies and
[3:17:21.840 --> 3:17:28.960]  gentlemen drum roll please of books in the world the great reset in the war for the world is one
[3:17:28.960 --> 3:17:38.080]  two three four five six seven eight nine we are now number nine in the world this is major this
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:44.000]  is political this could fund our war chest just go to amazon dot com everybody and buy 10 copies
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:49.040]  send this blueprint to the death star and the new world order because you read this you know their
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:53.040]  whole plan how to stop them hit the great reset more of the world now it's gonna go to number one
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:18:01.680]  what do you make of that we are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange
[3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:08.480]  space between what we've known and what's to come and right now the most important thing to remember
[3:18:08.480 --> 3:18:15.680]  is don't panic stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:23.440]  onto a safe sound course there is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:30.480]  our own society all we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:38.000]  the world fiat currency system is racing towards zero it's time to convert it into hard assets now
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:45.600]  including food water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready go to prepare today dot
[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:53.920]  com for the essentials storable foods water filtration first aid power and more at prepare
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:18:59.440]  today dot com if you're like myself and so many other people on this planet especially as you get
[3:18:59.440 --> 3:19:05.600]  older you gain weight even if you eat a lot less i gotta tell you info wars is only about bringing
[3:19:05.600 --> 3:19:10.000]  you amazing products that really work so we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:17.280]  our operations with and we said one of the best-selling natural healthy anti-fat weight loss
[3:19:17.280 --> 3:19:23.280]  products that are out there we went looked at the top 10 they all had the same ingredients in common
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:31.120]  that is in this product but with our new product from x7 diet force we got the very best concentrates
[3:19:31.120 --> 3:19:38.720]  of these known natural essences that's two amazing things for your body and so i've lost almost 40
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:43.440]  pounds i'm so a little bit of a weight in the last three months and i've been doing it using diet
[3:19:43.440 --> 3:19:49.600]  force and also exercise well now diet force is exclusively available right now at info wars store
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:56.160]  dot com 40 off info wars store dot com diet force you need to take this product it really works
[3:19:56.160 --> 3:20:03.680]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:19.360 --> 3:20:23.440]  dr lee merits our guest here on the alex jones show the third hour she's a visionary medical
[3:20:23.440 --> 3:20:28.080]  doctor or military veteran and she's been the tip of the spear exposing all this it's on a
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:33.520]  shut up during this segment and the next and just let her host and and and and start over and and
[3:20:33.520 --> 3:20:39.280]  lay all this out because it's so big and i've studied it myself it's not a really even a gene
[3:20:39.280 --> 3:20:46.320]  therapy like they say it just cuts your dna it just kills your dna but it also rewires you and some
[3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:52.560]  people to grow faster some slower they're testing on us all like guinea pigs and we've got claus
[3:20:52.560 --> 3:20:59.760]  swap saying it's a revolution taking us over dr merit please continue well thank you i um
[3:20:59.760 --> 3:21:05.200]  so i basically i i tell people we need to change our language so we understand what's going on
[3:21:05.920 --> 3:21:12.240]  the idea we keep talking about these viruses but quite frankly we have we have some proven technology
[3:21:12.240 --> 3:21:17.200]  that can cause disease but what is unproven is viral transmission especially airborne viral
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:23.360]  disease so let's let's turn our thinking more and let's move over to the idea that they're using
[3:21:23.360 --> 3:21:29.840]  toxins against us you know in latin uh virus means toxin and in ancient medicine the only
[3:21:29.840 --> 3:21:35.520]  two treatments are purification and detoxification and we've lost sight of that and we've gone to
[3:21:35.520 --> 3:21:40.000]  this idea that that these little antimicules float out of our mouth and make people sick and
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:44.640]  everybody says well but i know people get sick yes but you can get sick for other reasons
[3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:48.480]  and i think i want to start there actually because it leads into all this and it's maybe
[3:21:48.480 --> 3:21:55.200]  not what you're going to expect but there in the 1930s and 1920s in in russia in the soviet union
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:59.600]  and trust me the russians are way ahead of us on this research or at least way ahead of what
[3:21:59.600 --> 3:22:06.160]  we're being told we have there was a guy named kosnachev and this is what he did he he took a
[3:22:06.160 --> 3:22:12.320]  tissue and he divided it in two parts and he put cells into one container from half of the tissue
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:18.240]  and cells in a container b let's say from the other the other cells and then he connected them and
[3:22:18.240 --> 3:22:23.280]  the only thing that connected them in it was in one now one chamber but separated between the
[3:22:23.280 --> 3:22:29.280]  tissues was an optical window then he took the first side of these cells and he blasted them
[3:22:29.280 --> 3:22:34.480]  with let's say a radiation i mean he killed he was going to murder the cells somewhere either with
[3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:41.600]  radiation uh staphococci he could put in bacteria he could put in arsenic you name it whatever he
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:48.400]  put into side one then he watched what 12 hours later he watched to see if side two started changing
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:55.360]  well if the window glass was glass between those two chambers nothing happened but when he put in
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:00.880]  quartz he started to see an effect and what the effect was and it was subsequently called the
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:08.480]  mitogenic effect or my favorite is death photons what he what he showed was that side b starts dying
[3:23:08.480 --> 3:23:14.080]  using the same pattern of death if it was radiation side b started dying from radiation if it was
[3:23:14.080 --> 3:23:22.400]  arsenic side b started dying with the same symptoms of arsenic death okay so so whatever was killing
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:27.840]  side a moved over to side b when they weren't physically correct connected they were connected
[3:23:27.840 --> 3:23:34.640]  by an optical quartz window and that quartz window allowed the uv the difference between
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:40.960]  quartz and glasses quartz allows ultraviolet or near ultraviolet rays to get through so that's why
[3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:46.560]  they named them the death photons because they said something is being given off by these cells
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:53.920]  that is causing these other cells to get sick now if we take a step back and we say look if they can
[3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:59.600]  if they can if this is happening and we know that it has an electromagnetic signature and we can
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:06.160]  capture that electric magnetic signature just like Luc Montagnier showed and others then we could
[3:24:06.160 --> 3:24:12.800]  we could program and we could broadcast disease when people say well if there are no viruses
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:20.400]  how can i get sick i'm going to tell you this is how now royal rife um yeah they did a lot royal rife
[3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:28.160]  was doing the opposite royal rife was a very well known scientist also about the same time
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:35.760]  he developed a microscope of 50 or 5780 some parts that he handmade that had all quartz
[3:24:35.760 --> 3:24:42.160]  optics and quartz allowed you to see all this radiation all i mean all the uv light all this
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:50.000]  different wavelengths now he could get 15 000 um magnification off a light microscope what can
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:56.400]  we get today a hundred years later we're we're stuck yes there's a picture of royal rife who's uh
[3:24:56.400 --> 3:25:04.080]  who was born near where my office is actually but he here he is in 1929 now we are in 2022 and we are
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:10.000]  still hampered by having light microscopes that don't use a complete quartz system don't use his
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:15.760]  patented lighting and we can get maybe 2500 but what did he tell us well he told us a lot of things
[3:25:15.760 --> 3:25:20.800]  and think if we'd gone down this road he said that he could watch with this microscope and this is
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:27.600]  pretty impressive in the days before fully catheters he sat there for over 24 hours sometimes 36 hours
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:33.440]  i guess without moving to observe the live bacteria and what he showed is that bacteria
[3:25:33.440 --> 3:25:39.360]  had a had what they call a pleomorphic phase in other words bacteria would morph into viruses and
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:45.200]  back again into bacteria what he called viruses now they were smaller things that were moving around
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:50.240]  he called them viruses but they aren't what we call viruses and the other thing he noticed was
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:54.800]  that all these different things whether it was tuberculosis or staphylococci whichever one it
[3:25:54.800 --> 3:26:00.160]  was they had a specific wavelength they had a different color so a different color meant a
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:06.880]  different wavelength and so he developed the um what he called the mortal oscillatory resonance
[3:26:06.880 --> 3:26:12.000]  or mor it was a complementary wavelength or a non-complementary that could blast these things
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:17.600]  and kill them there's a famous story i don't think it's apocryphal i think this really happened
[3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:23.600]  he went to multiple radio stations in san diego near where his lab was and he asked him if they
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:29.760]  all simultaneously on one day would broadcast a particular frequency a particular sound for a
[3:26:29.760 --> 3:26:34.720]  particular period of time and after it was over he announced he said there we have just cured
[3:26:34.720 --> 3:26:42.160]  tuberculosis in san diego because what he showed is that if you find the right um the right frequency
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:47.920]  you can do lots of things so he was doing good but there's a potential to do evil so i'm just
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:52.640]  going to say we we have been this knowledge has been hidden from us but it was not hidden from
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:27:00.000]  the germans for example they were doing it um causna chev's work was re uh looked at in a famous
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:04.880]  lab in germany and guess what it was called it was called marburg and what do we think about marburg
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:09.600]  we hear about marburg we hear about a virus of marburg but to be honest there are less than 600
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:17.120]  cases of marburg in the world what's really going on here so let's say you so i i personally think
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:24.560]  we are looking at wavelength men's medicine and we're looking at wavelength medical warfare
[3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:34.400]  and ultimately we are dna we are we are wavelength beings and we can be manipulated that way well
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:40.320]  they know dna is a is a is a transceiver and i remember going to telegraph has done the reports
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:45.440]  when a when a sperm breaks into the egg there is a pulse of energy and they don't even know
[3:27:45.440 --> 3:27:49.680]  what where it comes from there's like an interdimensional releases and electromagnetically
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:54.880]  releases and we know that we're electrochemical that's how our cells operate but they ignore all
[3:27:54.880 --> 3:27:59.120]  that in so-called mainline science because we know from tesla and others it's the real science
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:04.160]  right and that spark i believe is what they call that's why they called it the mitogenic
[3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:11.440]  effect the russians actually discovered that and so i think that there's a lot of potential there now
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:16.880]  that gets us back to the whole issue of what are what are we facing we're facing what happened during
[3:28:16.880 --> 3:28:22.240]  the covet lockdowns well they put up all these 5g towers that that that should have been a
[3:28:22.240 --> 3:28:27.600]  suspicious moment to begin with the second thing is when now we're finding out there's no there's
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:34.320]  no genetic material in the vaccines there's graphene reduce graphene oxide now graphene oxide
[3:28:34.320 --> 3:28:40.320]  i'm not i'm not you know i i know dr noak the uh the german scientist german doctor that died
[3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:45.840]  was talking about this razor blade effect but quite frankly graphene oxide is so so tiny i'm not
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:51.520]  sure that's really what's going on here i don't i'm not buying that it's slicing anything um except
[3:28:51.520 --> 3:28:57.520]  maybe maybe dna it may damage you know don't america stay there this is fascinating the cavalry

[3:31:02.320 --> 3:31:08.720]  relationships to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear the number one cause of
[3:31:08.720 --> 3:31:15.360]  marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men have is a

[3:33:11.680 --> 3:33:18.400]  we've been told it's genetic revolution with the republic or against it resistance to
[3:33:18.400 --> 3:33:25.600]  tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones we've been told this is genetic revolution we've been
[3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:30.800]  told our bodies are being taken over by the club of rome and devos group at the un and now they're
[3:33:30.800 --> 3:33:36.240]  doing an early merit medical doctor is here laying out what's really in these so-called
[3:33:36.240 --> 3:33:41.680]  shots that have killed so many people the whole separate subject that we've been vindicated and
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:46.880]  we've all been confirmed to be accurate that you're nine out of ten dying of covid they say
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:51.600]  they are dying from the shots that's a british medical journal it's all coming out they don't
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:56.080]  care they got caught that's a whole other subject where is this going next but one of the shots
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:02.080]  actually really do and why would they risk global rebellion to put these in us dr lee marrett please
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:08.800]  continue yeah well i i don't know if you want to talk a little bit more about the shots but i i was
[3:34:08.800 --> 3:34:12.960]  you could talk about whatever you want doctor well i'm i'm going to just proceed on a little
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:19.200]  bit with this nanotechnology issue and the and the issue of it not being primarily genetic
[3:34:19.200 --> 3:34:24.560]  modification necessarily as we think of it and i was saying i love that you played the uh west
[3:34:24.560 --> 3:34:31.280]  world theme because really i think that's telling us things if you look at west world it's very
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:36.960]  expensive to maintain synthetic robots wouldn't it be a lot cheaper if they could just put something
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:43.120]  here to control me i mean that's really where this goes i think is that no that's what claus
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:47.360]  swab set up with the clip at the first hour we're going to make humans the commodity the revolution
[3:34:47.360 --> 3:34:54.000]  is taking humans over right i mean i i think that in my mind i used to think the world was uh
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:59.120]  courier and ives and norman rockwell and unfortunately you were right long ago when
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:04.240]  you pointed out these the the statue of mo lock at our at our bohemian grove because
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:09.600]  the world is more like that we are we are dealing with we are serfs in a world that we
[3:35:09.600 --> 3:35:15.600]  have not understood and it's a criminal it's a horrible uh situation that were kept here by
[3:35:15.600 --> 3:35:20.080]  tax bondage and lack of knowledge so we have to understand this and the lack of knowledge is
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:25.760]  leading to the what i'm about to talk about and that's called the rise of the nano mafia okay
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:31.120]  there's a doctor and i just found this because i actually was looking up the kazarian mafia or
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:35.920]  something i was looking up some mafia point and this time before you get there they don't want to
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:40.800]  just have all our data they want to make us the data right we're going to be the data and we're
[3:35:40.800 --> 3:35:46.960]  going to be the robots because we self assemble we self reproduce we can take care of ourselves
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:51.200]  and then they can kill us off when they want and we can just be controlled i think that's
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:57.200]  where this goes so there's a doctor i believe he's a doctor he's at the faculty of medicine at the
[3:35:57.200 --> 3:36:03.120]  national university in my order to son marcos peru and anyways names david floris and he wrote an
[3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:08.160]  article that that came out on in the international physical medicine rehabilitation journal and the
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:13.680]  name of the article is the nano mafia nano technologies global network of organized crime
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:17.840]  and here's basically what he said and and honestly one of the reasons he wrote this is
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:22.800]  he was just kind of upset that people he thought were getting the Nobel prize in medicine and physiology
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:28.160]  and they were doing work on on essentially on unwitting
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:35.520]  patients on people that just like the death camps in in germany the people that were compelled to
[3:36:35.520 --> 3:36:41.440]  be in these and maybe not even know it or like the cia experimenting years ago with lsd and they
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:45.440]  they dosed people without them knowing it it's totally unethical and he didn't want people to
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:51.120]  be getting them the Nobel prize for this but anyway what what he said he says this is happening in
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:54.720]  south america it's really kind of starting there because they have the cartel experience
[3:36:55.360 --> 3:37:01.120]  that if you're going to do work in your if you're a high tech biotech research arm and you've got
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:05.840]  these grants and you've got this money but you can't get people to want to have nanobots put in
[3:37:05.840 --> 3:37:10.960]  their brain this is about nanobots um they're orders of magnitude smaller than anything we're
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:15.840]  talking with chip technology so these are things that travel through your bloodstream you can't
[3:37:15.840 --> 3:37:21.840]  really see them with a naked eye and really can't see them they're below microscopic levels so these
[3:37:21.840 --> 3:37:26.640]  are very very tiny so they didn't but people don't want to be dosed for this as an experiment no
[3:37:26.640 --> 3:37:32.480]  matter how much you pay them for the most part so they got in bed with the cartels and they got
[3:37:32.480 --> 3:37:38.960]  involuntary subjects and what he's saying is you don't need injections to get these nanobots into
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:46.320]  people um they actually believe that beer is the best best way to do it so what the what the
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:51.120]  cartels or what the criminal element that was involved in this figured out is that they could
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:57.600]  use it as nanotechnology as a criminal in their toolbox right as a weapon you know you don't
[3:37:57.600 --> 3:38:02.320]  have to go now i don't have to go and i don't have to use guns and and violence and and it's very
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:09.440]  messy to try and rob a bank all i have to do is take the bank ceo ceo out and and dose him in a beer
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:13.680]  you know having to have a drink of a beer and having dose and apparently beer works well because
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:19.440]  you know beer kind of has has things that open up your gut a little bit and open up your blood
[3:38:19.440 --> 3:38:24.080]  brain barrier it disinhibits you a little bit and apparently this the the idea is to put these
[3:38:24.080 --> 3:38:30.720]  nanotechnology devices in our brain and that was the new james bond movie was all about nanotech
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:37.520]  yeah i i interviewed j dire on you what you've had you've had he does some of your programs and
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:43.040]  he's really interesting on predictive programming and i started going back and looking at this stuff
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:51.040]  and and all through the last decades of movies and mostly i watch tv old tv shows they tell you
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:57.120]  over and over that that we have people among us that are not us and why do they do that why do
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:02.480]  they have a need to tell us what they're doing to program or subconscious yeah that's what i
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:08.320]  think he thinks it is programming at subconscious i'm not sure it isn't just a you know the the old
[3:39:08.320 --> 3:39:14.800]  the the the religious you know idea that if i tell you what i'm going to do and then you stupidly
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:20.080]  do it i'm not guilty i i think this is a i think this is the way they're it's a free will issue
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:26.400]  it's a free will issue and unfortunately what we've seen you know we always used to wonder
[3:39:26.400 --> 3:39:32.000]  as a child of the of the fifties that was not too far after world war two i remember my father who
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:36.320]  was a physician small town doc and his buddy sitting around talking about how could it
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:40.320]  when the when the word started coming out what had happened in nazi germany they kept saying
[3:39:40.320 --> 3:39:46.000]  how could this have happened how could this have happened well i think we now know and if if you're
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:51.360]  paying it and we've now got not only corrupt researchers we've got in corrupt governments
[3:39:51.360 --> 3:39:58.080]  goes without saying but we have corrupt hospital administrators health unions um professors every
[3:39:58.080 --> 3:40:04.080]  you know we've got a we've got the organization and it isn't you know it's not what we expected
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:08.160]  you know when they said we took an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and
[3:40:08.160 --> 3:40:14.000]  domestic i didn't really expect it would be domestic medical authority but that's what it's
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:20.160]  turned out to be and now they're using it for other things now you notice in canada um and i think
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:24.880]  it's a combination it's a control we're going to be controlled by this technology if we don't stop it
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:28.720]  and i think there's a way out to stop it but we're going to be controlled if we don't stop it and
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:34.480]  there's also depopulation there's no question this is about depopulation and and you know in
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:40.080]  canada right now i think i heard the number 30 but for sure what's happening is that elderly
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:46.080]  going into canadian hospitals are being offered euthanasia oh came out two weeks ago and said
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:51.040]  we're going to push euthanasia on people that's right and that's what they're doing i i heard 30
[3:40:51.040 --> 3:40:56.960]  percent were offered euthanasia so what's the point there it's because all governments ultimately
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:03.040]  don't value you as an individual you know this is this is getting rid of the deadwood that are
[3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:09.760]  too old or infirm or or something wrong with them it's bill gates saying kill the old lady
[3:41:09.760 --> 3:41:15.920]  and hire ten people that's exactly right that's exactly what we're doing and i actually i have
[3:41:15.920 --> 3:41:20.480]  to say in 2009 and when i was president of the association american physicians and surgeons i
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:26.400]  gave a talk about this and it was about the lessons of carl brandt still on the video somewhere and
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:34.000]  um on youtube but amazingly but um you know the reason that they did it is they had a philosophy
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:39.840]  and the philosophy was that the state the organization trumped your individual rights
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:46.000]  it's that's what all of this is about all of this is is abrogating our individual rights
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:52.320]  for a world in which there's there's technocracy it's so organized and and worked out and don't
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.280]  worry that we won't have all that messy electoral process problem that's what this is about it's
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:03.680]  it will we'll probably have the the appearance now the issue really is how how we get out of this
[3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:11.280]  and the first thing i want to say is the the people running this show you know in 2011 there was a
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:16.720]  guy named i think glad felter in switzerland and he did a he did a study and he showed that of all
[3:42:16.720 --> 3:42:22.880]  the corporations millions 37 some million corporations in the world they really boiled down to be 147
[3:42:22.880 --> 3:42:27.600]  companies you know we hear about black rock state street and vanguard or the big three but there are
[3:42:27.600 --> 3:42:32.480]  147 companies and then people on wall street looked at that and said actually they're run by
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:37.280]  you know 10 big funds and then somebody else on wall street said well if you know that then you
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:43.120]  know that those funds are actually in the control of about 150 men around the world so it's right
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:48.160]  out of john colman's book on the committee of 300 where he claimed the 300 men ruled the world
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.040]  global corporate dictatorship generally meritless talk about solutions straight ahead we'll be back

[3:47:45.840 --> 3:47:50.800]  and what we can do as a community so as individuals the first thing you have to realize is don't be
[3:47:50.800 --> 3:47:57.200]  afraid because they love it and it's counterproductive to your survival it doesn't help you knowledge is
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:02.560]  the antidote to fear you you need to learn things and they're the world now is has been divided into
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:07.440]  kind of two groups and that's the group that sit back passively and let the news tell you things
[3:48:07.440 --> 3:48:12.800]  that's just listening to the intelligence services don't do it you have to actively go out and seek
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:17.680]  out the truth and question everything and when i've for me question everything means go down to the
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.640]  basic science so you know as deep as you can dive to feel out how did they actually prove something
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:28.800]  to be true um so you got to have knowledge the the other thing is you need to be healthy to be a
[3:48:28.800 --> 3:48:33.600]  warrior in this we want to save the world for our children at least i do and i think most of you do
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:38.320]  so just to be i i think there are five or six things i always say about being healthy the first
[3:48:38.320 --> 3:48:44.000]  thing is don't poison yourself it's unbelievable the number of poisons we take in um but some of
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:48.720]  them are almost unavoidable like the city fluoridates your water but we have solutions for that too but
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:56.640]  don't don't purposely taken things like you know wheat products that that are doused with glyphosate
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:00.880]  i mean there's just so many things you have to you have to look at that so don't poison yourself
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:05.040]  and then you need essential nutrients you need about 90 essential nutrients that you can't get
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:09.680]  except eating it and our soils are depleted so alex you've got the you know you've been on this
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:14.800]  this you are the tip of the spear on this you've been doing this for years i mean they they're
[3:49:14.800 --> 3:49:18.880]  going to lie to you the government lies to you says oh those those supplements that just makes
[3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:24.720]  expensive urine no that's what set us up for this don't don't believe them uh research it yourself
[3:49:24.720 --> 3:49:30.240]  you need to supplement there's certain things that you you need parasites parasites are a big
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:35.600]  lie i've got a parasite protocol on my on my website it you know i i learned some of this
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:39.920]  from brian artist but also just think about it there are there are five or six things they really
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:45.040]  really don't want us to have in terms of drugs and they are all anti-parasitic drugs chloroquine
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:53.680]  hydroxychloroquine nitrozoxanide um uh um what am i blanking on ivermectin and then chlorine
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:49:59.200]  dioxide they really don't want you to have that chlorine dioxide is a universal antitoxin and
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:03.440]  it helps with the fluorine problem it helps with lots of things i would i would you know
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:08.000]  people go to jail just for mentioning it i'll mention it and say this is for educational
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:13.680]  purposes only this isn't this is not approved by the fda i just happen to use it um so you have
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:20.080]  to take care of yourself now the other thing is don't abet the enemy don't work for these guys
[3:50:20.080 --> 3:50:25.600]  you know eichmann didn't kill all the people in the death camps little people like we did it we
[3:50:25.600 --> 3:50:31.120]  got together and we didn't stand up and we didn't quit you know if you're a nurse or you're a pharmacy
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:37.440]  tech and you're still injecting these toxins into children stop doing it because it won't be forgotten
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:42.160]  you know the the thing we have to remember is the 150 guys on the top of this pyramid
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:48.160]  they move money they move around a lot of words but they don't do the physical reality of working
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:53.120]  the world of creating the wealth of doing all the things we do they're just keeping us separated
[3:50:53.120 --> 3:50:57.920]  from each other and fighting each other so we don't realize that we have to start realizing that
[3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:02.640]  so i think you know i think that's uh that's a that's a big way to go now the other thing is
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:07.360]  don't let them distract you with viruses when we need to be starting to look at
[3:51:07.360 --> 3:51:12.560]  at wavelengths i'm i'm serious during this outbreak early on i realized there was the the
[3:51:12.560 --> 3:51:16.880]  fix was in there was something wrong here even though i still you know was kind of going down
[3:51:16.880 --> 3:51:21.440]  that viral paradigm i noticed that the guys in hypha had taken out the wi-fi from their
[3:51:21.440 --> 3:51:26.560]  kids schools hmm they thought it was dangerous and there's a lot don't let them tell you there's
[3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:32.080]  no evidence for this there's lots of research you can find online there's a ton of it uh arthur
[3:51:32.080 --> 3:51:39.040]  fursenberg um just has a download that you can do i mean there's just a lot of stuff uh that show
[3:51:39.040 --> 3:51:45.520]  you the damage of of all sorts of wavelengths i just did a um a deep dive on the pandemic of 1918
[3:51:45.520 --> 3:51:51.920]  and really that started with the telegram lines telegraph lines that the guys moved down from the
[3:51:51.920 --> 3:51:56.880]  farms in tennessee and they were suddenly surrounded by all this copper wire and this telegraph it
[3:51:56.880 --> 3:52:04.720]  sounds a little crazy but it really is true because to in fact the earlier um alex you put up a video
[3:52:04.720 --> 3:52:10.000]  and it showed the part of the electron transport chain how do you metabolize your food you take the
[3:52:10.000 --> 3:52:16.720]  food in it goes to your mitochondria and it it has an electron transport chain and that transport
[3:52:16.720 --> 3:52:22.800]  chain gets messed up when you suddenly change into a higher electromagnetic field and that's
[3:52:22.800 --> 3:52:28.080]  what happened that's one of the studies show once new electromagnetic systems go in we get sick we
[3:52:28.080 --> 3:52:33.920]  adapt to it quickly but but that's when we all these studies show it's happening right and we don't
[3:52:33.920 --> 3:52:39.680]  always completely adapt to it so i can't remember if it wasn't a paul or shrillank i'm just having a
[3:52:39.680 --> 3:52:44.720]  brain blackout on the country but i just read about this and basically the country had been you know
[3:52:44.720 --> 3:52:50.960]  rural uh not electrified for its entire existence and i think in the 1990s about the time we were
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:56.320]  putting in cell phones the country the government decided to electrify the country that country
[3:52:56.320 --> 3:53:02.800]  developed the highest rate of diabetes you know change the the the rate of change of diabetes
[3:53:02.800 --> 3:53:08.480]  in that country was number one in the world now again you will adapt to some degree but every
[3:53:08.480 --> 3:53:13.600]  time we've made a jump up we become a little more sick i mean there's a real issue here so the one
[3:53:13.600 --> 3:53:19.200]  thing you can do personally is you know hardwire your house put your cell phone at least one arm
[3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:24.800]  lengths away i measured this on myself when you put it one arm lengths away it's not it's not it
[3:53:24.800 --> 3:53:30.720]  registers pretty much almost zero i don't know it's the length of the transmitting antenna it
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:37.840]  becomes half as weak each length away right right so yeah it's the inverse square law so all radiation
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:42.480]  goes down for every two times you for every double of the distance it goes down the square so it goes
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:50.160]  down four times so you you need to do that and and that's why it does make sense to wear to use
[3:53:50.160 --> 3:53:58.080]  wearables to have things in your area that mitigate um the wi-fi's in in in ionizing radiation like
[3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:02.560]  we're talking about x-rays you have to block it i spent well let's go back to start a world war two
[3:54:02.560 --> 3:54:07.520]  they started heating up cans of beans at the end of world war two in england they noticed people that
[3:54:07.520 --> 3:54:11.840]  worked around renter say so we're getting cancer that's in mainline history books so these are
[3:54:11.840 --> 3:54:16.720]  broadcasting systems just as we don't see them doesn't mean it's not shooting through our dna
[3:54:16.720 --> 3:54:23.440]  shooting through the the neurons of our body blasting through uh the molecules that make us up
[3:54:24.880 --> 3:54:30.160]  oh yeah and that and that's the point about about treating things with wavelength too the good news
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:35.760]  is this this opens up the possibility for restoring health using this technology now
[3:54:35.760 --> 3:54:39.920]  you know i think we're way behind on that but nonetheless i i'm not giving up hope on that
[3:54:39.920 --> 3:54:44.960]  i hope that that is what the med bed's about people ask how are the globalists doing all this
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:48.800]  and protect themselves well they've got they've got the cures they've got the treatments
[3:54:50.080 --> 3:54:54.400]  yeah yeah they know you know i'll bet you bill gates doesn't live in a wi-fi environment
[3:54:54.400 --> 3:55:01.760]  i'll bet you he doesn't you know that's just for us so we're we're being constantly toxified
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:06.640]  and it's going to get worse i think they're going to start dosing us with graphing now that there
[3:55:06.640 --> 3:55:13.760]  are some things you can do like i i like um bob greska i met years ago bob greska is a real nano
[3:55:13.760 --> 3:55:20.800]  chemist and he developed carbon 60 which is a buckyball it's like it's like 60 carbon atom
[3:55:21.680 --> 3:55:27.840]  carbon solution in solution and it's an electron donor one of the reasons i think that we're getting
[3:55:27.840 --> 3:55:33.440]  the the final common pathway with this low formation when your red blood cells kind of stand up and
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:38.160]  and all clump together and that's what can start these clots and i'm not saying it's the only thing
[3:55:38.160 --> 3:55:44.720]  but it can start it is that these these vaccines have um cations in them yeah there's the there's
[3:55:44.720 --> 3:55:51.600]  the carbon 60 this is the antidote but but these cations um they they strip the electrons from the
[3:55:51.600 --> 3:55:55.680]  laminar flow system of your capillaries and so everything starts clumping together what you
[3:55:55.680 --> 3:56:00.480]  need to do is restore the electrons you need an electron donor and so uh there's certain things
[3:56:00.480 --> 3:56:07.120]  that do that i i mean i think carbon 60 makes a lot of sense i also think chlorine dioxide
[3:56:07.120 --> 3:56:13.680]  makes a lot of sense um and and un-wifiing your house i think we have to do that i think you have
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:18.480]  to get get away from as much wi-fi as possible you're going to have some but it's dose related
[3:56:18.480 --> 3:56:23.200]  so even if you just turn it off at night time the good news about the 5g is it doesn't travel that
[3:56:23.200 --> 3:56:29.280]  far the bad news is they're going to improve everything so um so i think China's already rolling
[3:56:29.280 --> 3:56:38.720]  out 6g yeah and keep in mind um g is generation so i don't know what 6g is because 5g is anything
[3:56:38.720 --> 3:56:43.920]  over a gigahertz everything else before our cell phones before we're always below one gigahertz
[3:56:43.920 --> 3:56:48.160]  and now we're we're one gigahertz up to whatever they want to do so i don't know what they mean by
[3:56:48.160 --> 3:56:54.320]  that but i do know and and this was just reported and i think it was Karen Kingston it was somebody
[3:56:54.320 --> 3:57:00.240]  pointed out that looks at patents that i my eyes glaze over but the chinese patent for their vaccine
[3:57:00.240 --> 3:57:08.320]  their covid vaccine admits to having graphing in it so this is not just conspiracy stuff
[3:57:08.320 --> 3:57:14.480]  there's a global a global program they're putting the plug in us the interface dr lee merritt incredible
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:21.040]  hour please join us again very very soon themedicalrebel.com we love you we appreciate you you're
[3:57:21.040 --> 3:57:29.520]  definitely over the target thank you so much thank you all right folks i got loaded phone lines here
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:33.760]  from tim and greg and paul and jonathan and mike and i said i get to your call so i'm gonna do those
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:42.000]  and then i'm gonna hit the latest trump news i'm gonna tell you what trump responds to my
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:50.640]  ultimatum was they was donald trump and the magnate republicans represented extremism that
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:55.920]  threatens the very foundations of our republic i wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an
[3:57:55.920 --> 3:58:04.160]  operational name in fact i bet it does i bet it's called operation matador they see us as the bull
[3:58:04.160 --> 3:58:11.760]  and they are shaky a red flag in our face and the matador is the deep state with a long skinny
[3:58:11.760 --> 3:58:17.760]  razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward the matador uses the force of its weight
[3:58:17.760 --> 3:58:24.160]  to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust
[3:58:24.160 --> 3:58:29.360]  they've got the ace of spades in their hand which is false flags before you launch a war you stage
[3:58:29.360 --> 3:58:34.400]  false flags that's the first thing you do because nobody wants to say they started a war bad guys
[3:58:34.400 --> 3:58:41.200]  start wars so every time a war gets launched by bad guys they stage an event this is operation
[3:58:41.200 --> 3:58:53.200]  matador there is nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's what
[3:58:53.200 --> 3:58:58.480]  people recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not going to find a better place
[3:58:58.480 --> 3:59:03.200]  for information you might not agree with everything you might not agree with our perspectives but we
[3:59:03.200 --> 3:59:07.760]  cover all the information and uh there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here thank you
[3:59:07.760 --> 3:59:13.280]  for that word infowarstore.com by the way the products he mentions infowarstore.com is where
[3:59:13.280 --> 3:59:18.640]  to get them folks and we do have the best supplements I mean just like we try our best with our news
[3:59:18.640 --> 3:59:25.520]  coverage and our information we do the best with our supplements as well I mean look at the hair
[3:59:25.520 --> 3:59:29.680]  and beard support formula folks this is a this is a joke I mean we're giving this thing away
[3:59:29.680 --> 3:59:35.360]  it's 75 off by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula
[3:59:35.360 --> 3:59:43.520]  is working for me quite well I might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard support
[3:59:43.520 --> 4:00:07.520]  for men I go and see them quite often now. If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
