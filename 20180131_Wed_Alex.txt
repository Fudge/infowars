[00:28.860 --> 00:33.840]  play it right now trump after the speech says he will 100% release the
[00:33.840 --> 00:39.420]  fives of memo he said we've got to be so angry if we didn't the question is
[00:39.420 --> 00:45.720]  when will he release well the word is they're looking to do it Monday but
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.080]  here's the president after the victorious state of the union that even
[00:50.080 --> 00:56.600]  has democrats in their own stewed polls at 70 to 75 percent in support of the
[00:56.600 --> 01:17.660]  speech so very very exciting we've got some bad news though and hopefully this
[01:17.660 --> 01:24.640]  is just a real accident and hopefully it's not sabotage town hall is
[01:24.640 --> 01:30.600]  reporting train carrying lawmakers to GOP retreat involved in an accident the
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.720]  annual republican retreat is set to take place
[01:32.720 --> 01:37.040]  Wednesday in white sulfur springs with many top republican leaders West
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.520]  Virginia however there appears to have been an accident as the lawmakers were
[01:40.520 --> 01:47.400]  enroute news per a GOP aid via a member of the train the train carrying members
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.840]  of Congress the GOP retreat just had some kind of accident said people seem to
[01:51.840 --> 01:56.680]  be okay but there appear to be some injuries here's another being reported
[01:56.680 --> 02:01.040]  the train carrying GOP lawmakers to a retreat in West Virginia has collided
[02:01.040 --> 02:08.240]  with a dump truck initial reports indicate everything is okay just like
[02:08.240 --> 02:13.120]  hashtag hunt republicans and congressman scolese getting shot ladies and
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.400]  gentlemen I'm not a cheerleader for political parties or leaders I'm a
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.560]  cheerleader for the truth and Trump over-delivered the last year the
[02:22.560 --> 02:27.000]  American people have awakened we've over delivered as well the speech was true
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.920]  grit it was from the heart it was direct it was truthful it was strong and it was
[02:31.920 --> 02:39.480]  empowering it was booing and the response by the Democratic Party Bernie
[02:39.480 --> 02:44.560]  Sanders video feed cutting out for 90% of the time is very emblematic an
[02:44.560 --> 02:49.200]  archetypal socialism the other Democrat leaders response spit all over his
[02:49.200 --> 02:56.680]  face like a demonic heathen all of it is incredible and to then see MSNBC say
[02:56.680 --> 03:04.080]  this is terrible ladies and gentlemen they talked about families and we don't
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.720]  have families anymore they actually actually said that drudges linked to
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.560]  our article MSNBC's joy read triggered by Trump using the word family church
[03:14.560 --> 03:20.560]  family police military the national anthem Trump trying to call on all of
[03:20.560 --> 03:26.440]  the tropes of the 1950s era nationalism the goal of a speech appears to be to
[03:26.440 --> 03:34.160]  force the normalization of Trump on the terms of a bygone era his supporters
[03:34.160 --> 03:44.680]  are nostalgic for so family church you know security prosperity that's a bygone
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.080]  era and then you understand they're targeting families because they want
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.640]  you all alone and it's in their own textbooks we're being managed by the
[03:52.640 --> 03:57.080]  psychological warfare chiefs who were totally cold-blooded they're not left
[03:57.080 --> 04:02.160]  as loons they're creating mental patients in the colleges they're creating
[04:02.160 --> 04:06.480]  dysfunctional people that have to be in a system that can't make it on their own
[04:06.480 --> 04:12.960]  to then hold the rest of us hostage and and they're so honest about it now
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.520]  Trump and and and info wars and all of you we have forced this debate out the
[04:17.520 --> 04:21.640]  open and they're like listen you're not gonna have prosperity and you're not
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.000]  gonna have families and you're not allowed to have it I mean at every major
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.680]  school in the country now I'm like it's federal dollars under Obama's behavior
[04:31.680 --> 04:35.000]  the government you said there's what they're gonna eat that you can't say
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.400]  mom or dad father or mother or he or she on the entrance forms I mean that's
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.040]  cult level when you can't say I'm a man I'm a woman because that could hurt
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.920]  somebody else's feeling this is high level psychological warfare to make us
[04:48.920 --> 04:54.000]  all alone plugged into the matrix we'll be back with incredible excerpts from

[06:21.920 --> 06:34.640]  well to say that I am polaxed to say that I'm dizzy to say that I'm basically
[06:34.640 --> 06:39.240]  speechless is a understatement by the State of the Union speech and just
[06:39.240 --> 06:45.160]  everything setting in for me personally and my parents that I watched it with
[06:45.160 --> 06:53.400]  my wife and children last night because you've got the best of worlds but you've
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.960]  also got the worst of it the tale of two cities it was the best of times it was
[06:57.960 --> 07:03.560]  the worst of times we were all going straight to heaven we were all going
[07:03.560 --> 07:11.880]  directly to hell it was feast or famine you are seeing such honesty such
[07:11.880 --> 07:22.680]  directness such true grit such courage and delivery in one year and then you've
[07:22.680 --> 07:28.640]  got the Democrats like howling lunatics
[07:28.640 --> 07:41.600]  frothing and uncloaking and saying basically don't criticize MS-13 or
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.920]  you're racist or I don't want to hear about family and church that's all gone
[07:45.920 --> 07:51.920]  you're not gonna have that anymore and you realize that Bernie Sanders who you
[07:51.920 --> 07:54.560]  know was one of the people that responded to this last night as a
[07:54.560 --> 08:04.240]  Democrat response honeymoon in the Soviet Union in Moscow back in the 70s
[08:04.240 --> 08:09.400]  when you had to basically be a Russian agent to even go there I mean it's just
[08:09.400 --> 08:16.440]  incredible and then they turn around and say we are the anti-Americans when the
[08:16.440 --> 08:25.880]  country is just turbo-charging back it's so clear how bad they are and of course
[08:25.880 --> 08:32.360]  most of Sanders response cut out emblematically because socialism doesn't
[08:32.360 --> 08:35.000]  work except for the dirtbags want to control everybody so we're gonna be
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.320]  getting back to that in a moment but
[08:39.040 --> 08:44.120]  watching Trump's speech and we're gonna air large segments of it today and in
[08:44.120 --> 08:49.000]  the fourth hour right into the war room we're gonna air rear the whole thing so
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.120]  coming up in the fourth hour into the war room that starts with Owen and others
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.320]  we're gonna just air the whole thing in pieces today because it's incredible and
[08:59.320 --> 09:02.720]  the fight we've been through and the battles we've been through and the
[09:02.720 --> 09:06.520]  victories and the defeats and the blood sweat and tears and then did you could
[09:06.520 --> 09:11.520]  have victory and to know the memos coming out and Trump said he's gonna
[09:11.520 --> 09:20.440]  100% release it in the next few days I think Monday at the latest and it's just
[09:20.440 --> 09:28.080]  incredible that we're in the middle of this epic historical battle and Trump's
[09:28.080 --> 09:33.880]  right when he said this is the new American moment this is like Martin
[09:33.880 --> 09:40.720]  Luther King I have a dream speech that changed so many hearts and minds it's
[09:40.720 --> 09:46.640]  like Washington crossing the Delaware and the next day having victory at
[09:46.640 --> 09:52.200]  Trenton the first victory over the Hessians and the British troops it's
[09:52.200 --> 09:59.320]  like the flag getting raised at Iwo Jima by the Marines what it symbolizes is
[09:59.320 --> 10:05.520]  we're back we understand who the enemy is we understand who's showing all the
[10:05.520 --> 10:10.240]  race war garbage who's injecting the poison who's venomous who's bad who's
[10:10.240 --> 10:15.160]  been holding us down who's been sending all our jobs to communist China as
[10:15.160 --> 10:21.080]  Democrat fat cats sitting over the slave factories I mean these people are
[10:21.080 --> 10:25.960]  bad news and they've got a playbook Van Jones doesn't believe a word he says
[10:25.960 --> 10:32.520]  Gutierrez when he heard USA USA ran out like it was a vampire and and the Sun
[10:32.520 --> 10:39.240]  had risen because he's funded by the Ford Foundation to come turn Hispanics
[10:39.240 --> 10:43.480]  into anti-American racist and then break the country up that's the globalist
[10:43.480 --> 10:50.400]  plan to steal the American dream from America that's 50% Hispanic already
[10:50.400 --> 10:55.600]  below the age of 25 and with another decade it'll be 50% total and if you
[10:55.600 --> 11:02.760]  look by your 2050 some projections are like 70% you are having the birthright
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.240]  of free market and Second Amendment and all this stolen from you by people
[11:07.240 --> 11:10.880]  funded by the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation the Carnegie
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.680]  Foundation like Mr. Gutierrez who is on record and he wants everybody watching
[11:15.680 --> 11:24.080]  to know you can't say USA USA the night circuit wants you to know you can't have
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.360]  American flags on because that's evil you can't have a family you can't have
[11:30.360 --> 11:36.360]  an identity you can't have anything and so why this was so powerful is that it
[11:36.360 --> 11:41.640]  shows we were being suppressed by design one year in things are turning
[11:41.640 --> 11:46.280]  around the patient's getting better and you've got these globalists trying to
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.600]  squat on America and suppress us it is unparalleled
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.960]  Trump's whole speech is about unity and nationalism and pride and families and
[11:57.960 --> 12:04.760]  Gutierrez says it's explicitly racist see that's the inversion of reality it's
[12:04.760 --> 12:09.720]  Gutierrez that's Metsha and Laraza do I have to tell people what Laraza and
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.480]  Metsha's slogans are for those in the race everything for those outside the
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.200]  race nothing it's the same as the KKK now let's continue here you don't think
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.040]  people in the KKK think they're good well these folks think they're good too
[12:22.040 --> 12:25.960]  they're brainwashed into it when they're born by these leftist families they're
[12:25.960 --> 12:29.680]  sent to colleges that teach it because the man wants that taught at the
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.320]  colleges because the big banks and the Ford Foundation the Carnegie Foundation
[12:34.320 --> 12:38.080]  the Bill and Mona Gates Foundation they're the big one now fund those
[12:38.080 --> 12:43.960]  liberation theology studies Bill Gates doesn't want Hispanics to be Americans
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.200]  and to have that birthright he wants to steal it from you but let me get to the
[12:48.200 --> 12:53.280]  big news here on DrudgeReport.com and illustrates everything that I am
[12:53.280 --> 13:00.720]  talking about here and we'll put that article up on screen forming MSNBC's
[13:00.720 --> 13:08.280]  Joy Reid triggered by Trump using the word family just like I remember 15 years
[13:08.280 --> 13:11.160]  ago I couldn't believe it when I was given a Calhoun reader from the
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.680]  University of Texas that all social workers were taught from and it said
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.640]  the family belongs to a bygone era they even use the same term and is
[13:21.640 --> 13:27.840]  prehistoric they use that term as well and must be eradicated that's pure
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.760]  communism like like North Korea okay that was the goal in 1984 was to break
[13:33.760 --> 13:38.680]  the families up and then here she is church family police military the
[13:38.680 --> 13:45.360]  national anthem Trump trying to call on all tropes the 1950s era yeah past the
[13:45.360 --> 13:51.560]  Civil Rights Act all that defeating Hitler the goal of his speech appears to
[13:51.560 --> 13:57.360]  be to force the normalization of Trump on the terms of the bygone era his
[13:57.360 --> 14:04.040]  supporters are nostalgic for church family again think of how wicked that is
[14:04.040 --> 14:08.800]  and then here's Joy Reid let's play a clip of her last night responding saying
[14:08.800 --> 14:15.200]  MS-13 only people that watch Fox News know what that is no if you're in
[14:15.200 --> 14:20.480]  Guatemala or Mexico or in all 50 states this country and you are in a Hispanic
[14:20.480 --> 14:26.440]  predominant area in a poor area you are being fed on and robbed and your
[14:26.440 --> 14:31.200]  children are being recruited by absolutely crazed maniac death worshipers
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.120]  that worship the grim reaper okay and are responsible for over 150,000 people
[14:36.120 --> 14:41.080]  dead a lot of those dead in Mexico but she just says it doesn't exist and
[14:41.080 --> 14:47.080]  Gutierrez says it's racist no people with satanic tattoos all over them
[14:47.080 --> 14:53.800]  running around murdering people is a big problem producing methamphetamine and
[14:53.800 --> 14:58.680]  they kind of get almost all the people they prey on are other Hispanics because
[14:58.680 --> 15:01.800]  they're underclassed they're they're they're being exploited by the
[15:01.800 --> 15:06.960]  Democratic Party and a big Republican company owners and they're this
[15:06.960 --> 15:11.080]  permanent underclass and in this 13 is right there squatting on them and here's
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.360]  this lady saying oh it's not an issue here she is the defining issue of the
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.840]  Trump administration thus far is how he got into office it consumes Donald
[15:20.840 --> 15:25.600]  Trump's time it can it is an obsession if you believe all of the reporting in
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.120]  the Michael Wolf book and even not beyond the Michael Wolf book he spends his
[15:29.120 --> 15:32.840]  time complaining about the prosecutors who are investigating Russian
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.000]  interference conspiring to fire them thinking about them obsessing about them
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.680]  and then he gives a speech tonight in which he makes it sound like the biggest
[15:40.680 --> 15:45.160]  issue in the United States of the biggest threat is MS-13 again nobody that
[15:45.160 --> 15:48.320]  doesn't watch Fox News has ever heard of so it makes it sound like they're the
[15:48.320 --> 15:53.200]  big we're going to break because that is that is the biggest Latin American

[20:44.600 --> 20:49.840]  news amazing speech by the president delivering in the last year promising
[20:49.840 --> 20:55.920]  to deliver even more taking the chains off of america talking about unity even
[20:55.920 --> 21:02.640]  skewed democrat run polls had him at 70 75 76 78 and that's the poll that came
[21:02.640 --> 21:08.200]  out everywhere when it was phone polls computerized polls you name it and they
[21:08.200 --> 21:12.560]  are just freaking out right now because they're even over sampling democrats
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.080]  still in those polls and they are getting 70 percent or higher that is red
[21:18.080 --> 21:23.080]  level panic for them and you've got democrats running out of there when they
[21:23.080 --> 21:27.880]  hear us a chance when he says america's back our industry's back our families are
[21:27.880 --> 21:33.080]  back it's like and then you have democrats running out because you can't
[21:33.080 --> 21:38.760]  say us a and then other democrats on msnbc going you can't talk bad about ms
[21:38.760 --> 21:43.720]  13 and the washington post has come out and said that too and oh don't talk about
[21:43.720 --> 21:48.520]  families don't talk about church you that's all gone you can't have that you
[21:48.520 --> 21:54.960]  cannot make this up these people are such villains and then this is breaking
[21:54.960 --> 21:59.520]  Paul Ryan was on board the train carrying lawmakers a whole bunch of
[21:59.520 --> 22:09.160]  lawmakers to a high level GOP retreat a truck kamikaze rammed it a cement
[22:09.160 --> 22:17.400]  truck a big truck comic a dump truck kamikaze rammed it and Paul Ryan was
[22:17.400 --> 22:24.520]  on board there's one dad a bunch of people injured but what's the odds of
[22:24.520 --> 22:28.640]  this no this is a message you better believe it and they're gonna spin it
[22:28.640 --> 22:32.800]  and try to oh it's no big deal everything's fine oh vegas is an
[22:32.800 --> 22:36.040]  islamic of course it's come out it has and oh there's not multiple shooters
[22:36.040 --> 22:42.520]  this is a serious message very serious message that we can get you anywhere you
[22:42.520 --> 22:45.840]  are you go to your baseball practice we're gonna shoot you we're gonna come
[22:45.840 --> 22:52.800]  out to your family rammed the front of the train killing the driver and derailing
[22:52.800 --> 23:00.000]  part of the train I mean this is amazing so this country is in a civil war you
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.480]  can believe this was on purpose I mean I'd say 98% chance that this is
[23:04.480 --> 23:09.200]  unbelievable you had two miles away in Washington
[23:09.200 --> 23:13.960]  anti-fameting with videos and police raids saying they were gonna derail
[23:13.960 --> 23:21.680]  trains at that exact place and derailing a train a month before but nobody but it
[23:21.680 --> 23:27.480]  wasn't a passenger train and then they go oh the driver admits that he missed the
[23:27.480 --> 23:33.240]  speed limit and just went ahead and went too fast around there yeah whatever I
[23:33.240 --> 23:41.840]  mean this is getting ridiculous so GOP train collision in Virginia and Rand
[23:41.840 --> 23:46.360]  Paul's talking about it on Fox News right now let's fade up some of this
[23:46.360 --> 23:50.600]  audio if we can please no and then I guess over time people will have to
[23:50.600 --> 23:54.800]  investigate these things and figure out you know are there sensors on the train
[23:54.800 --> 23:58.280]  that the engineer should know there's a truck you know a mile in advance that's
[23:58.280 --> 24:02.960]  on there did it happen in an instant it's such a great question considering you
[24:02.960 --> 24:08.200]  know right at this hour Sandra we have covered our share of train accidents you
[24:08.200 --> 24:11.200]  know I mean it's the lunch hour on these coasts and so you have a lot of activity
[24:11.200 --> 24:15.960]  but it is unbelievable and we've got the video up on in fours calm I really want
[24:15.960 --> 24:22.560]  to get into all of the amazing clips and the speech itself and then what the
[24:22.560 --> 24:25.760]  Democrats are up to just illustrating that they're as bad as we thought they
[24:25.760 --> 24:28.800]  were and they're even worse I mean they are just committed to division
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.960]  committed to evil committed to
[24:36.880 --> 24:42.280]  dominating and controlling and and being manipulators being villains being
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.560]  crooks there are so many people who think being evil and lying and manipulating
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.880]  and being nasty is cool they think it's powerful and they get off on it and the
[24:52.880 --> 24:59.640]  only way to deal with it to stand up to them and again the media will say oh
[24:59.640 --> 25:06.160]  Jones before there was any evidence said that this was probably a dirty trick
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.120]  it could have been some innocent person had a heart attack or you know that
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.760]  stuff happens but this train after the State of the Union in Virginia it's
[25:15.760 --> 25:21.760]  known where it's going and now this happens you can't have the Democrats
[25:21.760 --> 25:25.440]  saying we're gonna kill Republicans hashtag hunt Republicans and Scalise
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.080]  getting shot trying to take out the leadership trying to take out Trump all
[25:29.080 --> 25:32.560]  these calls for violence anti for saying we're gonna go out and kill police and
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.720]  kill Republicans and then when you have stuff like this happen you have to say
[25:36.720 --> 25:42.040]  we've got to look at foul play you've got a default say they say they're gonna
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.840]  do this type of stuff we know they're targeting the Republican leadership then
[25:45.840 --> 25:55.880]  it has to be investigated for that potentiality it may not be I'm gonna
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.280]  open the phones up to I've got Larry Pratt the head of Congress of America
[26:00.280 --> 26:07.800]  popping on for the segment or two in the next hour on the bump stock band
[26:07.800 --> 26:11.520]  because now they're the Democrats are trying to add anything that enables
[26:11.520 --> 26:17.200]  rapid fires they're trying to tie 30 round mags or larger to bump stocks
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.320]  confusing the public there's nothing to do with it and so we're gonna get an
[26:21.320 --> 26:27.120]  alert and a breakdown from Larry Pratt of the GOA with his operatives on the
[26:27.120 --> 26:31.080]  House Senate floor to give us the real intel on what the staffers are passing
[26:31.080 --> 26:37.200]  around behind the scenes so that is coming up bump stock band takes effect
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.680]  in Massachusetts on February 1st yeah and a lot of states are starting to pass
[26:42.680 --> 26:49.760]  those so we're gonna be following that now when I come back I want to just run
[26:49.760 --> 26:54.320]  through a stack of headlines and statements and quotes from the state of
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.360]  the Union and then leftist behavior responding to it and then we're going to
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.760]  start playing large clips of POTUS but this is just an incredible time to be
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.760]  alive right now but I can tell you this they're going to strike back and they're
[27:08.760 --> 27:12.440]  going to try to bomb and they're going to try to kill and they're going to try
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.360]  to to intimidate the leadership of bringing America back into submission
[27:17.360 --> 27:23.640]  and you've seen globalist operatives go on MSNBC and singing in and say if you
[27:23.640 --> 27:27.800]  release the memo there will be massacres in America so what they're
[27:27.800 --> 27:31.840]  saying is false flags will be done against the Democratic Party and their
[27:31.840 --> 27:35.800]  own operatives and then we will blame you just like Oklahoma City which was
[27:35.800 --> 27:40.040]  totally Bill Clinton and Hillary we know who did it the names the hotel receipts
[27:40.040 --> 27:43.360]  it all came out in lawsuits I've interviewed the police officers that
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.440]  survived the family members of the police officer that was murdered because
[27:46.440 --> 27:49.960]  he saw the bombs in the building Terrence Yankee I've made three films on it
[27:49.960 --> 27:57.840]  that was a Clinton inside job 100% and I'm telling you they are right now with
[27:57.840 --> 28:02.760]  their criminal networks looking to stage massive false flags in this country to
[28:02.760 --> 28:06.280]  make themselves a victim you can a thousand percent guarantee that right
[28:06.280 --> 28:10.200]  now but they're not in control completely anymore they got stay behind
[28:10.200 --> 28:14.000]  networks they've got their operatives still embedded and they've got foreign
[28:14.000 --> 28:18.600]  help that's why we need to understand that a lot of the middle leadership are
[28:18.600 --> 28:24.720]  still Clinton and Obama operatives that's why FBI CIA military police officers
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.280]  veterans average citizens you've got to not just watch football on your off time
[28:30.280 --> 28:36.720]  you've got to penetrate all the leftist groups you have to go grow a scruffy

[28:45.560 --> 28:49.880]  because they're powering up right now a violent revolution we have to infiltrate
[28:49.880 --> 28:53.600]  every one of the organizations now we need human intelligence on the ground

[33:22.400 --> 33:35.480]  transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6
[33:35.480 --> 33:42.880]  Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:43.960 --> 33:49.560]  ladies and gentlemen one of our great producers Matt had one of the most
[33:49.560 --> 33:54.880]  powerful ideas I've heard in a long long time we're gonna get to that here in
[33:54.880 --> 34:00.080]  just a moment as it ties into all this but here's the president humanizing
[34:00.080 --> 34:04.360]  victims of MS-13 and then you've also got the poor lady shot in the back in
[34:04.360 --> 34:08.440]  San Francisco and the leftist jury wouldn't even give the guy manslaughter
[34:08.440 --> 34:12.960]  which is accidental death because they had to virtue signal that illegal aliens
[34:12.960 --> 34:18.200]  are angel kicks even if you've been deported what five times like he had and
[34:18.200 --> 34:23.960]  had a bunch of convictions some people been deported up to 40 times drunk
[34:23.960 --> 34:31.400]  driving murder you name it they're above the law and the left wants to
[34:31.400 --> 34:38.040]  advertise come to America crap all over it because as Joy Reed has come out and
[34:38.040 --> 34:42.960]  said you don't have church you don't have family she actually said this it's on
[34:42.960 --> 34:47.720]  drudgereport.com and info wars.com she said that's a bygone era and it's
[34:47.720 --> 34:53.000]  basically racist that the president said that say having anything having any
[34:53.000 --> 35:00.680]  wealth any family anything is now evil and that ties in just to how they want
[35:00.680 --> 35:05.760]  people totally alone and domesticated and that's in the WikiLeaks it's top
[35:05.760 --> 35:09.400]  Democrats talking to Hillary and Podesta and they go the answer is
[35:09.400 --> 35:13.680]  demoralizing people and keeping them in the dark and absolutely desperate and
[35:13.680 --> 35:17.760]  then Hillary shooting back all these baristas and then they're in their mother's
[35:17.760 --> 35:23.560]  basements at 35 and they think I'm gonna give them everything they hate you they
[35:23.560 --> 35:29.320]  want to make you poor and totally control you they have total disdain for you
[35:29.320 --> 35:34.520]  and then these leftist love their masters it's so shit but but here's what
[35:34.520 --> 35:42.040]  I wanted to say Trump last night put the biggest dent in the mind control force
[35:42.040 --> 35:47.680]  field that the average leftist has been put in and just rammed a huge giant
[35:47.680 --> 35:52.640]  gaping hole in their main gate and we've got to pour through I mean this is how
[35:52.640 --> 35:56.520]  it is exponentials taking decades to build a critical mass info wars drudge
[35:56.520 --> 36:01.920]  you the listeners all of us have blasted holes through their propaganda wall
[36:01.920 --> 36:11.480]  through their electronic iron curtain and now we've moved our big battering
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.960]  ram Trump up and he's under full attack just gleaming in the flame and the fire
[36:16.960 --> 36:24.320]  and now Trump's on fire but they're on fire and now the battering ram they just
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.880]  cut all the big ropes and the weights went cranking back and just boom and the
[36:28.880 --> 36:37.800]  gates just want BAM I mean it's just but there's that train going right through

[36:46.600 --> 36:53.160]  whole stage deal now the train gets rammed by a loaded dump truck killing
[36:53.160 --> 36:56.600]  the driver injuring a bunch of people and partially derailing it with the
[36:56.600 --> 37:01.120]  speaker of the house on board do you really think that's an accident maybe
[37:01.120 --> 37:06.240]  it's a wonderful nice guy who knows maybe somebody poisoned him and parked

[37:24.720 --> 37:31.920]  wonderful nice person probably yes okay so let's go ahead and play the
[37:31.920 --> 37:38.400]  president right here humanizing victims of MS-13 for decades open borders have
[37:38.400 --> 37:45.560]  allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities they've
[37:45.560 --> 37:51.800]  allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the
[37:51.800 --> 37:58.200]  poorest Americans most tragically they have caused the loss of many innocent
[37:58.200 --> 38:05.080]  lives here tonight are two fathers and two mothers Evelyn Rodriguez Freddy
[38:05.080 --> 38:11.880]  Quavis Elizabeth Alvarado and Robert Mickens their two teenage daughters
[38:11.880 --> 38:19.120]  Kayla Quavis and Nisa Mickens with close friends on Long Island but in
[38:19.120 --> 38:27.560]  September 2016 on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday such a happy time it
[38:27.560 --> 38:35.240]  should have been neither of them came home these two precious girls were
[38:35.240 --> 38:42.000]  brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown six members of the
[38:42.000 --> 38:51.240]  savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders many of these
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.400]  gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the
[38:56.400 --> 39:06.080]  country as illegal unaccompanied alien miners and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's
[39:06.080 --> 39:14.960]  high school Evelyn Elizabeth Freddy and Robert tonight everyone in this chamber

[39:27.880 --> 39:36.360]  kill people you never get to learn about it or they don't tell you who did it now
[39:36.360 --> 39:43.720]  here is the response by the very same lady last night Joy Reed on MSNBC saying
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.280]  church family police military the national anthem those are terms of a
[39:48.280 --> 39:53.040]  bygone era and she goes on saying you're not gonna get it because there's a
[39:53.040 --> 39:58.560]  several tweets I mean this is just crazy but see if you're a slave master you
[39:58.560 --> 40:04.600]  understand men and women are kept apart children are taken by the house this is
[40:04.600 --> 40:10.760]  how slavery is done and nobody's better at carrying it out historically than
[40:10.760 --> 40:15.360]  women who come from a line of slaves because it was women that would be used
[40:15.360 --> 40:21.280]  over the men going back to Rome there's manuals on this and that's why you you
[40:21.280 --> 40:28.560]  get this archetypal image that is projected by the media out there with
[40:28.560 --> 40:32.320]  leftist pushing this agenda they're very very cold-blooded let's play that
[40:32.320 --> 40:36.920]  clip and then he gives a speech tonight in which he makes it sound like the
[40:36.920 --> 40:40.960]  biggest issue in the United States of the biggest threat is MS-13 a gang no
[40:40.960 --> 40:44.520]  buddy that doesn't watch Fox News has ever heard of so it makes it sound like
[40:44.520 --> 40:49.480]  they're the biggest because he he's playing to the audience that he wants
[40:49.480 --> 40:53.000]  applause from and the audience on the right just wants to hear that first
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.480]  have that speech by the way sounded like he went in a time machine and gave it in
[40:56.480 --> 41:03.120]  1950 he talked about bringing coal back a dying in the coal beautiful coal what
[41:03.120 --> 41:05.920]  is that about he sounded like he was running for president against white
[41:05.920 --> 41:09.720]  Eisenhower I don't know what I mean he sounded like a president from the past
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.160]  and in the second half of the speech was about how all immigrants are murderers
[41:13.160 --> 41:17.080]  and he needs to stop them from coming to the country through family migration it
[41:17.080 --> 41:21.720]  was a bizarre okay I think right you know I can spend an hour going over her
[41:21.720 --> 41:24.200]  lies right there but we don't have the time but number one he didn't say
[41:24.200 --> 41:27.920]  everybody coming here is a murderer that's the total lie beautiful people
[41:27.920 --> 41:34.160]  great people but he's got a vet folks okay then she says coal this is from
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.040]  Eisenhower we have totally clean coal we have some of the cleanest coal in the
[41:38.040 --> 41:41.120]  world that we have scrubbers that make it totally clean everybody else is using

[47:39.640 --> 47:46.680]  Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen we've got big
[47:46.680 --> 47:53.040]  developments on this dump truck attack on the train carrying the speaker of the
[47:53.040 --> 47:58.040]  House and others the day after the State of the Union right as the train left the
[47:58.040 --> 48:07.520]  Charlottesville area that's coming up but first if you just joined us I played
[48:07.520 --> 48:14.040]  the clip of Trump humanizing fathers and mothers that lost their sons and
[48:14.040 --> 48:20.000]  daughters to MS-13 being humanized by the president the big no-no of the left
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.920]  you never humanize the victims of Islamic attack of MS-13 attack you name it
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.840]  and the president has now trolled them yet again and tricked them to do on a
[48:29.840 --> 48:36.240]  national plane in a big national debate what they've already been doing and
[48:36.240 --> 48:41.920]  that's defending MS-13 chain migration, illegals killing people, liberal
[48:41.920 --> 48:46.880]  juries in San Francisco letting illegals shoot women in the back and just saying
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.760]  you can go free because this is their religion is hating America this is what
[48:51.760 --> 48:54.840]  they're engaged in so they usually cover it in the news here cover it there but
[48:54.840 --> 48:59.560]  never have a big national debate about it Trump just chumped them just tricked
[48:59.560 --> 49:05.840]  them in the biggest troll ever to come out the Washington Post CNN MSNBC
[49:05.840 --> 49:11.400]  Van Jones Joy Reid all these nobodies have come out and are now calling him
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.000]  racist even though it's Hispanic and black folks that had their kids killed by
[49:16.000 --> 49:23.720]  MS-13 amazing it's mainly Hispanics that get killed by MS-13 and they turn it
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.480]  into if you want to say no to a transnational gang you're a bad person
[49:27.480 --> 49:36.160]  so we had the idea to come out and say CNN is ISIS because CNN had supported
[49:36.160 --> 49:40.080]  ISIS they supported the Arab Spring they supported what happened in Egypt and
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.840]  Libya and giving the weapons to them and they were attacking Trump last year
[49:44.840 --> 49:47.560]  trying to sit in the military with the Russians to take them out which he's
[49:47.560 --> 49:51.720]  done successfully it's a perfect parallel now they're saying oh you talked
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.160]  about MS-13 that'll make it worse just like oh you talked about ISIS that'll
[49:56.160 --> 50:02.280]  make it worse no we went and crushed it so we created I think Mike Cernovich was
[50:02.280 --> 50:06.320]  involved in the idea but our audience launched it t-shirts you name it it was
[50:06.320 --> 50:13.920]  all over the news had a huge effect CNN is ISIS but with this it's even better
[50:13.920 --> 50:23.920]  and we just tweeted it at real Alex Jones please retweet it hashtag MS-NBC is
[50:23.920 --> 50:32.640]  MS-13 it fits even better than CNN MS-NBC defends MS-13 says don't talk bad
[50:32.640 --> 50:38.880]  about MS-13 that they're the that they're basically don't even exist they're
[50:38.880 --> 50:46.080]  not a problem illegals aren't twice as likely to commit crime no that's the
[50:46.080 --> 50:49.240]  national crime statistics they don't want to have a debate about that so they
[50:49.240 --> 50:52.840]  just say shut up your race is your bad Trump you know Hispanic family black
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.040]  family are here had their kids killed it's racist to say it was wrong that you
[50:57.040 --> 51:02.320]  know hit that that a Hispanic gang killed him crazy basically a death cult
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.520]  where it's more and more radical and they always one up each other that's what
[51:06.520 --> 51:13.800]  happens in these death cults and so now we're putting the hashtag out MS-NBC is
[51:13.800 --> 51:18.400]  MS-13 now obviously they're gonna try to game this and censor it but they can't
[51:18.400 --> 51:23.240]  stop you putting it out on YouTube on Facebook on Twitter just the idea that
[51:23.240 --> 51:31.720]  MS-NBC is MS-13 because they defend MS-13 they think MS-13 you know shouldn't
[51:31.720 --> 51:37.360]  be criticized they choose MS-13 over these families and their dead children
[51:37.360 --> 51:40.720]  killed on Long Island and the thousands of others that have been killed here are
[51:40.720 --> 51:49.160]  the hundreds of thousands killed in Mexico and Guatemala and now they're so
[51:49.160 --> 51:54.480]  arrogant they have come out and jumped the biggest shark I've ever heard of and
[51:54.480 --> 52:02.320]  are attempting to sell this idea I've got Washington Post you name it Trump is
[52:02.320 --> 52:09.720]  wrong about MS-13 his rhetoric will get make it worse incredible
[52:10.480 --> 52:14.360]  yeah there it is Mexico to beef up troops and crack down against violence
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.520]  after a record 25,000 murders just last year now let me get back to what I was
[52:18.520 --> 52:22.560]  breaking down Trump wants to stop that from totally coming here it's already
[52:22.560 --> 52:27.160]  here the severed heads out front the police stations the girls getting
[52:27.160 --> 52:33.760]  kidnapped the sex slavery the meth labs all of it and because of that the
[52:33.760 --> 52:39.480]  Democratic Party that's deep in bed with it they're upset so magically Paul Ryan
[52:39.480 --> 52:44.800]  and the Republican leadership get on an Amtrak train so they can wargame while
[52:44.800 --> 52:49.720]  they travel they're gonna go out to a retreat that they've been having for
[52:49.720 --> 52:55.520]  decades and a dump truck rams into the train and the media's spinning it well
[52:55.520 --> 52:58.720]  it was on the track the guy may have had a heart attack sure he's a wonderful
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.200]  person but these are computerized controlled tracks that's why they
[53:03.200 --> 53:06.480]  admit they can use driverless cars to kill people or the remote controls can
[53:06.480 --> 53:09.280]  get hacked on airplanes and fly them into buildings I told people about that
[53:09.280 --> 53:12.800]  decades ago people didn't believe me now it's ubiquitous now it's all over the
[53:12.800 --> 53:20.600]  news and so did a Democrat dump truck just try to derail the Trump train oh
[53:20.600 --> 53:25.320]  I don't know the day after the State of the Union when the train left this
[53:25.320 --> 53:30.040]  morning from DC going through Charlottesville that's Democrat run and
[53:30.040 --> 53:35.120]  then right there this happens a dump truck just happens to ram into the
[53:35.120 --> 53:39.680]  front of the train and the media is like we don't know what happened maybe it
[53:39.680 --> 53:43.880]  was stalled maybe it drove across maybe the signals didn't work maybe this maybe
[53:43.880 --> 53:49.920]  that what are the chances this is an accident as Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.240]  would say when things happen in politics it's planned that way we better
[53:53.240 --> 53:59.040]  believe that this is super stinky something is rotten in the state of
[53:59.040 --> 54:04.640]  Denmark is there a chance that I don't know a bolt of lightning would hit the
[54:04.640 --> 54:12.920]  train and blow up a gas tank and and and kill the speaker or something because
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.120]  here's the deal Paul Ryan's bad news but he's a follower he's now getting in line
[54:17.120 --> 54:21.360]  McConnell's getting in line they're all getting in line they've tried to defeat
[54:21.360 --> 54:24.680]  Trump they believe that each state state would take them out they thought
[54:24.680 --> 54:28.600]  Russiagate would work it didn't work the memos about to get released Trump said
[54:28.600 --> 54:31.520]  last night hundred percent he's gonna release it let's queue that up in a
[54:31.520 --> 54:40.240]  moment but I need everybody right now to understand if you put out hashtag MSNBC
[54:40.240 --> 54:48.760]  is MS13 man it goes together like a horse and carriage they'll block it we put
[54:48.760 --> 54:51.760]  out that incredible twilight zone video that McBreen spent a month putting
[54:51.760 --> 54:55.160]  together they wouldn't let us share it on Facebook they wouldn't let us share it
[54:55.160 --> 54:58.840]  on Twitter to your own it you can hand share it you can tell friends and
[54:58.840 --> 55:03.640]  family do whatever it takes you can change the name of it and reuploaded
[55:03.640 --> 55:07.600]  on your YouTube channel or your Facebook get around the sensors they can only
[55:07.600 --> 55:11.800]  mainly watch our channels and then if you give them a different name like

[55:16.280 --> 55:18.800]  on our site that only had a hundred thousand views because they admittedly
[55:18.800 --> 55:21.880]  block us project Veritas has been inside congressional hearings it's all

[55:26.280 --> 55:30.520]  million over here it's getting out because you're uploading it yourself

[55:52.440 --> 55:57.840]  maybe maybe a sinkhole opened up the whole train goes in maybe it was an
[55:57.840 --> 56:01.400]  accident when Scalise got shot and he tried to kill his other congressman and
[56:01.400 --> 56:05.800]  said he wanted to kill the leadership maybe that didn't exist either
[56:07.240 --> 56:14.820]  maybe the stock market's not 26,000 maybe I don't exist we're in a civil war
[56:14.820 --> 56:17.840]  ladies and gentlemen trying to get our country back from globalist police I
[56:17.840 --> 56:23.200]  haven't plugged hardly any we got to find the operation we've got bodies the
[56:23.200 --> 56:28.120]  strongest of turmeric highest quality that that we could get at a very low

[56:43.560 --> 56:49.160]  price but I thought contractually I couldn't put it out under the DNA force
[56:49.160 --> 56:52.280]  name because that had been in partnership with group and he couldn't get the
[56:52.280 --> 56:55.920]  same deals we could he's so nice he saw that we got this better deal just said
[56:55.920 --> 57:00.600]  you just manufactured DNA force plus now that we were planning to put out as he
[57:00.600 --> 57:04.400]  said this is such a great formula that's just how classy he is and so they'll
[57:04.400 --> 57:07.960]  only be one run of cell force then it will be known as DNA force plus let me
[57:07.960 --> 57:15.400]  explain more bio pqq more coq 10 more evolved I mean massively more and it's
[57:15.400 --> 57:22.880]  even lower price similar formulas are 200 to 400 to $500 because doctors

[57:26.440 --> 57:31.360]  300 okay whatever we don't do that I've been able to lower it costing is 50 60

[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:23.240]  Chinese the Romans the Egyptians the Babylonians the the Mesoamerican
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.360]  Mayans they didn't know why they just knew that when there were blood moons
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.640]  and and things generally it was associated with earthquakes big changes
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:37.480]  cultural changes and we've had record numbers of blood moons and last night
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.360]  I intended to get up at 5 a.m. to see it I just didn't do it I slept into like
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.520]  seven I don't normally do that but I was up pretty late last night after that
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.840]  amazing state of the Union and I was reading it wasn't just a blue moon it
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:56.360]  was a super moon meaning it was super close to the earth and we can roll some
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.680]  of it and then it was a blue moon meaning two in one month and then it there
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:08.680]  was an eclipse at 5 a.m. so it was a blood moon it was a super moon blue moon
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:16.160]  blood moon and reportedly that is just unbelievably rare depending on your
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.320]  geographic area I mean thousands of years that'll be seen again
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:26.120]  reportedly I mean this is just insane and then you've got that amazing state
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:35.160]  of the Union when all of this happened and you've got this train getting rammed
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.600]  by this truck and you know maybe the guy had a heart attack I'm sure it's a great
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:44.080]  person but the globalists aren't beyond killing somebody remote controlling the
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.640]  vehicle in I told you about self-driving cars and these train systems can be
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.960]  hacked and then you can not you know let the train know there's an obstruction
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.000]  coming up I mean there's all sorts of angles to this kid Daniel's got a story
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.760]  up on m4wars.com dealing with it but just look at this this is just wild if
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.240]  you're a TV viewer remember we're on a lot of radio stations I got to keep
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.200]  reminding myself everybody else we have over 200 radio affiliates and I'm like
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.800]  saying look at this look at that but you know again super moon meaning is close to
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:22.040]  earth blue moon meaning two in one month and blood moon meaning eclipse I mean
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:32.320]  that is crazy and then in all hell breaks list you know the Romans wouldn't
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.880]  march up the war voluntarily unless Mars was visible and then if Mars you know
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:45.120]  Mars is usually down by the horizon doesn't get up too high usually but
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:52.000]  I used to be an astronomy and but sometimes it gets closer and that's when
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.800]  and historically that they've checked when the Mars is close to the earth and
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.280]  they've checked historically all the world and then that's when massive wars
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.000]  break out and again I'm not into all this voodoo and superstition and mumbo
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.640]  jumbo and abracadabra hocus pocus but then you have to be people that are into
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.040]  it get obsessed with it it's a bunch of cons and charlatans acting like they
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:20.280]  understand it know what's going on but I mean just the moon when it's full is
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.320]  when the fish are all going crazy is when the animals are out hunting and
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.440]  then when and mating and it's been proven that animals go wild when there
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.280]  are full moons and when the moon is closer to the earth and that women
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.560]  generally line up their cycles at least in rural areas it's changed all the
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.160]  electromagnetic radiation stuff now in industrial society but the women all
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:46.960]  line up with the moon I mean it's just a lot of wild stuff going on and space
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.240]  winds and the Sun and but the globalist oh that you voted seven years ago and
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.520]  said the Sun has no effect on climate it's all humans because they want to be
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.080]  God they don't want to let you realize you're this little speck in the universe
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:06.040]  with an amazing mind that can grasp it but still incredibly small and they
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:11.040]  don't want you to have that awesome opening up and understanding and that
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:16.800]  infinity moment where you spacewalk spiritually and realize you are part of
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.160]  the past you are the present you are the future in infinity consciousness not
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.720]  just in the Zen moment of moment and forever but in the great genetic quest
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:33.400]  of life in the mind of God experiencing consciousness at a lower level and then
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:41.680]  projecting onward again with species in time jumps millions of years that that's
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:48.600]  our species time jumping seems to you like slow but it's instant in a higher
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.560]  dimension and then you add to all of that together with the spiritual level
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.920]  that interfaces it's all multivariate all ties together perfectly you know I've
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.360]  got some talking points here about caveman from info wars life calm but
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.800]  setting on those talking points let me just give you what I've experienced

[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:38.400]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live I am your host Alex Jones Larry Pratt
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.400]  can be joining us coming up here in a few minutes on the moves to restrict the
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:51.640]  second amendment not just bump stocks going after a larger capacity magazines
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:07:00.920]  you name it now first thing I want to do is just restate the big issue that I
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:08.200]  see here that America's back that the globalist are panicking that they could
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.080]  pull anything that I've said they're gonna launch attacks on Congress and
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.320]  they're gonna try to kill Republican leaders of Congress this week and I've
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:20.600]  been saying that for about the last two weeks I said building up towards the
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.760]  release of the memo they've had their operatives from the Obama National
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.760]  Security Council go on MSNBC and say quote if you release the memo there
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:35.320]  will be giant massacres now that means they'll do false flags on themselves to
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.240]  be the victim but you've seen hashtag hunt Republicans go at risk release and
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.960]  try to kill the leadership you've seen them push it all over the place they
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:49.400]  mean business and of course the little messenger girl from former Obama
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:53.160]  National Security Council she may not know what's even going on Alyssa Jordan
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.920]  the wife of Michael Hastings car that blew up MSNBC analyst claims
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:04.640]  conspiracies about FBI text messages could lead to violence he goes on to
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:10.720]  say massacres well we've now seen a dump truck full of trash
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:20.560]  ram the train did they hack in open the signals let the truck on tell the
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.680]  signals to not alert the train that's what you can do with hacks that's what
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.120]  you can do with these trains that are basically remote control and notice now
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.800]  that we have driverless trains more and more there's a conductor but he's
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.400]  sitting there playing on his iPhone you're having more and more of these
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:37.960]  wrecks so is this the conspiracy of the system falling apart or is it the day
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:42.280]  after a key state of the Union derailing the Trump train by changing the
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:47.560]  subject to the image of the Republican train being rammed by a dump truck full
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.480]  of garbage remember Matt Allen them calling Trump the garbage presidency and
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.600]  the garbage man and I said I love that logo I love that iconography I love
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:02.240]  that symbolism he's taking the garbage out that's a very honorable job taking
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:08.360]  the garbage out the country's coming back getting rid of the globalism Democrat
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.520]  dump truck derails Trump train question mark this is perfectly divert the news
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.360]  cycle away from Trump unifying the nation with his powerful speech
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.840]  hashtag train crash and another tweet I put out we really need to get out
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.160]  everywhere need to tweet it on Paul's tweet I need everybody to help us get
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:31.880]  this out Paul Watson's tweet I need the listeners to hashtag MSNBC is MS13
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.840]  now that they've said the president's bad for putting down the precious MS13 and
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.480]  for humanizing the Hispanic and black families that were there who had their
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:48.320]  children killed by MS13 in Long Island so again hashtag MS MSNBC is MS13
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:54.480]  please get that out everywhere until it's a slogan Hillary for prison Bill
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:02.400]  Clinton's a rapist lock her up CNN is ISIS if the shoe fits wear it and that's
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.400]  what we're doing but let me just read to you these headlines viewers approve of
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.880]  Trump's first state of the Union address CBS News polls 75% you Alex you say
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.520]  polls are fake yeah they over sample Democrats so it's probably 85 to 90%
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.760]  because I don't just believe one poll I looked at a whole spectrum I looked at
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.320]  eight different polls they were all 70 or higher we got video of this on info

[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:06.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:35.960]  well they're now reporting as many as 30 people injured
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.240]  one dead when a dump truck carrying garbage rammed in the front of an Amtrak
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:45.440]  train carrying the Republican leadership including the speaker of the house to an
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.400]  annual retreat they've had for decades right after the train left Charlottesville
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.160]  this happened now I'm not saying the driver did this he's probably a great
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:58.400]  guy but you could easily remote control a truck you could also have the sensors
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.680]  turned off so the train didn't know it was up there that's the problem driverless
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.480]  cars and these trains are basically driverless the fact that this happened
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:10.560]  the day after this historic speech with the Democrats saying hashtag hunt
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.000]  Republicans and Scalise getting shot and the plan to take out the leadership and
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.600]  all the calls for violence is very suspicious and we can pull the clips up
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.280]  if somebody can find it the notes from the last week I have been saying since
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.200]  last week over and over again before they release this memo they're gonna plan
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:33.680]  something violent now it's three dead okay so the numbers are you put that back
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.880]  on screen because we're getting conflicting reports there but we're
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:41.000]  following it as it goes so if you put that back on screen place
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.080]  well that's a Milan train derailment okay well good that's that's not that
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.240]  all right thank you guys appreciate that okay we're about to go back to Larry
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:56.600]  Pratt here just a moment I appreciate him joining us from gun owners of
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.240]  America gun owners.org a lot of people think we can go to sleep now about the
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.480]  Second Amendment but they have called to ban all semi-autos after what happened
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.280]  in Vegas they've had calls to ban bump stocks that's in Congress different
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.400]  states are banning them and different states are wanting to ban high-capacity
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.960]  magazine so there's a hysteria going with this right now and I wanted to get
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.960]  Larry Pratt on the head of Gunners America to give us the fact versus some
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.400]  of the fiction that's going on out there so Larry Pratt thank you for coming on
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.840]  with us what is the truth going on right now well thank you very much for
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:37.200]  having me Alex I really appreciate your interest in this subject the the bump
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:44.320]  stock is simply one more excuse that the anti Second Amendment crowd is trying
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.760]  to use to get rid of as many guns as possible I remember that I didn't even
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:55.960]  really this is many years ago know much what a semi-automatic was but when the
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:01.480]  left started pounding away is how bad these assault rifles were I went out and
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.160]  bought a few just because they didn't want me to have one and obviously all
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160]  during the Obama administration that was I think one of the factors was
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:16.440]  operating with the very robust gun sales is that in fact I was in gun stores where
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:21.080]  they had pictures of President Obama and a caption underneath saying gun
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:27.280]  salesman of the year well what they're going to do now is try to expand from
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.960]  this bump stock which is a it's an interesting device and it can be fun
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.480]  but it's not particularly practical unless maybe you're shooting people like
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.480]  those that might be in a barrel of fish but otherwise it's not particularly
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:49.280]  accurate it's an amusing accessory that you can put on a gun if you got it's
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:55.000]  fair hundred and fifty dollars I immediately had the same reaction when
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.120]  they started talking about bump stock in Las Vegas that went online to see if I
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.720]  could buy one they were all sold out and my desire to get one has
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:11.280]  subsequently subsided considerably but what I did years ago with my semi
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:17.760]  automatic rifle was to engage it so that my finger was able to bump back and
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.240]  forth and I would hold the barrel in just such a way that I was doing what the
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.920]  bump stock does not very accurate but neither is the bump stock the fact of
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:33.520]  the matter is guns or guns and we don't really have a problem until bad people
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:39.360]  want to do something and if we're gonna keep going back to the tragedy at Las
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:47.360]  Vegas at the hotel the hotel was a gun-free zone how did that work out
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.480]  so looking at legislation in the states versus DC what are the main threats
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.720]  right now because I see some of these reports that the Democrats are passing
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.280]  bills around it go after not just bump stocks but semi-auto you name it again
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.640]  and they're having some success at the state level I mean what's the what's the
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.600]  threat assessment right now on the current attacks on the Second Amendment
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.160]  not just with bump stocks but any other areas no I think you're you're spot on
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:17.960]  and this was what we were concerned about and said so in one of our email right
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:23.000]  after Las Vegas that this could very likely be used as an excuse to go after
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.280]  as much of the Second Amendment array as they could and true to form they're
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:36.200]  using that for precisely that reason the fact of the matter is I don't see them
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:41.760]  doing too much in Congress unless they are able to what they've done is to
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:49.440]  cobble a really serious measure onto the bump stock measure there the so-called
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:55.200]  fix-nix system and that has been before the Congress would expand the instant
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:01.360]  background check to all transfers of the firearms thus giving the government a
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:07.640]  complete list of anybody who's bought a gun period and eventually they'd have
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.840]  just about it and they're done in that list now they're not supposed to keep
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.520]  that list well lowest learner wasn't supposed to do what she did at the IRS
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.480]  when you give the government this kind of information count on it there'll be a
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:28.240]  rogue agent a rogue bureaucrat like like like like reality winner who will who
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:35.640]  will exact that is exactly the problem so we're very concerned that this could
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:41.720]  be but a first step and we've been telling the Congress don't do it this
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.640]  will not help your political situation because we know what's going on and you
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.880]  know it turned out that when the NRA said well let's have the Congress take a
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:58.800]  look at this maybe should be regulated more I'll tell you what that that got us
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.960]  more new members in a short order of time than we've had in a long time the
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.880]  American gun owner and I think the American public is not buying this I
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.360]  think we've come to the point now where we've seen that the government is not a
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:19.400]  trust for the entity it's way off there in Washington it's the very kind of
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.320]  problem that the founders sought to avoid by keeping government at the state and
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.400]  especially the local level but when it's often Washington it's very difficult to
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.200]  track what's going on and my next question is that Massachusetts and some
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.400]  other states have passed laws banning bump stocks and and they're now going
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:42.200]  after you know even the some of the firearms or even bolt action and some
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.240]  of the more controlled areas like Chicago and other areas even though we have a
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.800]  Supreme Court ruling saying they shouldn't be doing that are the
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:56.640]  Democrats still basically flagrantly ignoring the DC Heller decision the
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.920]  Democrats definitely ignore the Constitution they ignore Heller they
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:06.120]  ignore federal law the Democrats as you know I'm not this is no newsflash they
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:12.720]  are control freaks they want it all and they will move on as much as they
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:18.760]  possibly can in a somewhat related way you remember when the tax cut was being
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:25.200]  proposed by the administration Nancy Pelosi so that would be Armageddon in
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.360]  other words the end of the world if the Democrats can't take all our money
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.680]  that's the end of the world I want to do a few more minutes with you just to
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.720]  discuss where the gun culture is right now and how the Democrats are striking
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:39.360]  back and that they admit brainwashing children against it but but how you see
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.480]  in the long-term trajectory this fight going and I want to ask you your

[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.120]  they're coming back against us so we need your support
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:06.160]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:29.760]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show we are the most
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.800]  hated most demonized most attacked patriotic libertarian conservative
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:40.920]  Christian broad test in the world hands down Southern Poverty Law Center says it
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:46.960]  ADL congressional hearings do you name it New York Times Washington Post they
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:52.440]  say we're enemy number one and then we have project Veritas in two different
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:57.240]  undercover videos with Google executive saying our main job stop Alex Jones and
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.640]  then everybody else like him and to keep them in their own echo chambers and
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.960]  don't let them reach people because his information takes over and goes viral
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.240]  yeah we had 86 million viewers and listeners the week of the election last
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:11.200]  year year and a half ago now and that panicked them so when I get up here and
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:17.360]  brag and say that it's not bragging I'm saying we've got the information and the
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:24.600]  guest and the synergy that scares them what are vampires scared of sunshine they
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:31.280]  are scared of this broadcast and they have hit us hard in so many ways to
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.880]  censor us to block us to cut us off and so many other things I'm not at liberty
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:42.880]  to get into because some of it is subject of criminal investigations federally not
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:48.200]  of me of them and I'm just gonna stop right there but this is a very serious
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:53.960]  time to be alive right now and and understand they're capable of anything
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:59.240]  so we're beginning to win and turn the tide unifying the country around what
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.400]  made us great the globalist aren't going to turn loose and I wanted to ask Larry
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:07.280]  Pratt who's not just had a gun owners of America who Ted Nugent has said on air
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:11.600]  and so many others he's a board member of the NRA that if it wasn't for GOA we
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.520]  couldn't have basically radicalized the NRA to stop being a bunch of compromisers
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.800]  and and weasels like they were 20 years ago to what they are today so again the
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.200]  conscience of the NRA is GOA and isn't about praising GOA it's about
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.480]  understanding we have been down to the wire just since I've been politically
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:35.080]  involved for 25 years five or six times where the country was going to go
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:39.040]  completely over into tyranny and we have been so close just like this election
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.280]  and just like the tax cuts and just like everything else I don't want people to
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.640]  be too confident because the enemy is going to strike back I expect serious
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.560]  attacks on Republicans physical attacks you name it just experiencing what I have
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:57.520]  experienced there's so much to get into MSNBC's Joy Reed triggered by Trump
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.720]  using the word family she said church family police military the national
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:06.440]  anthem Trump trying to call on all the tropes of the 1950s that's a bygone air
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.720]  and she goes on and that tweet and others to say it's it's bad and then she
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:15.000]  defends MS-13 the Washington Post does Trump trolled them again didn't they Larry
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.080]  by by having victims of MS-13 one of the most deadly gangs in the world
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:26.200]  definitely the most vicious the most crazy and then he's bad for humanizing
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.920]  people and it just shows they're incredible disconnected did they not
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:35.120]  know that Trump was trolling them he knew that he was setting them up I mean
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:39.520]  it's incredible so speak to that and work what you expect them to do next
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.920]  because they never give up
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:50.640]  unhinged comes to mind frequently when I'm thinking of our opponents on the
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.560]  left they increasingly seem to be disconnected from reality they are
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.840]  more than frustrated that they don't have the control that they have long saw
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.760]  and I think they actually believe their own polling that they were going to win
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:13.920]  the last election and when they didn't they just fell apart and I don't think
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.240]  we've seen them come back together again and I guess Humpty Dumpty and all the
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:25.160]  Kingsmen couldn't put him back together again so we're watching a a continuous
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.240]  train wreck for sure you could ask about the Second Amendment and the
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:37.400]  president's speech he certainly made it clear that he's going to continue being
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:43.360]  what I think will go on record as being the most pro Second Amendment presidency
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:50.600]  certainly in the last hundred years this guy is acting quickly he has been
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:56.800]  undoing executive orders with his own executive orders that Obama had been
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:03.320]  signing to make it so that an old veteran who had somebody writing checks
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:08.000]  for it would be declared incompetent and because of that
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.960]  incompetency have his guns taken away Obama would was really good at finding
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:20.280]  any excuse whatsoever to grab guns well that's clearly over that's not going to
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:25.160]  happen for the next four hopefully next eight years or beyond President Trump
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.520]  has really made a difference and what I'm hoping is that the one thing that's
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:36.040]  big thing that's hanging fire that hasn't happened yet is that the
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.200]  Republican leadership like so many other Republican leaderships around the
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.320]  country don't really care about the gun issue and maybe it's even stronger maybe
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.840]  they really like the Second Amendment at all and so they're not moving on the
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.360]  national carry bill if the national carry bill passes particularly the way the
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:02.080]  House has it framed that means that you and I if we had to could go to Chicago
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:09.040]  on business with our concealed carry firearm and we would be legal put it in
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.000]  the belly of the plane when you check your luggage when you get to your
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.040]  destination reclaim it put it in your purse but further main lines the fact
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:23.160]  that good guys good women with guns is the answer is the facts and so we
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.240]  definitely need to get that's what you're saying to get to the next step in
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:35.720]  defeating this in closing for me it's surreal Larry to I've gone and heard
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:40.960]  Ronald Reagan speeches when I was a little kid and George W. Bush speeches
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:45.760]  or George Herbert Walker Bush speeches and then not really see it get
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.760]  delivered even though Reagan did do some good things I think was a good man
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:56.120]  obviously with Trump he's on a mission he's delivering the enemy hate seem he's
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:02.360]  just it's so refreshing to see someone do exactly what they say they'll do it's
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:07.520]  just it's just mind-blowing but then I see the media use right-wing attacks
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.040]  against him because that is the only thing that works by going oh see he told
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.400]  you he was gonna ship all the illegals out or blah blah blah and he hated all
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:21.280]  the Mexicans but now he's gonna let 800,000 stay if they are able to ensure
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.840]  everything else up he always said that back during the campaign so what they
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.280]  do is they misrepresent him on both sides people on the right wing want to
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.600]  get cheap you know shots in on things that Trump didn't do the left wing will
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.040]  then amplify right-wing media if it attacks Trump with false reports so I
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:44.360]  only see that angle now being one of the areas that they've got any hope I think
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:48.760]  with Trump we have to learn to take a deep breath especially those of us on
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:54.720]  the right and realize he's playing them like a strativarius violin and if he
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.360]  does something that I don't understand at first and wait a day or two or a week
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:05.960]  or so and you may just get to see that oh that's what he was up to Donald Trump
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:10.600]  is a smart cookie yeah he started out with a million or so bucks in his pocket
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:17.800]  but he didn't lose it and he hundreds times more from what he had inherited
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:23.800]  clearly the man is a doer and achiever and I'm just very impressed with what
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:29.480]  I've seen so far he's done more in his first year to undo the Obama
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.960]  administration than I would have thought at all possible I wouldn't even hoping
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:39.800]  for that kind of a broom coming through and just knocking it all out you're right
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:46.080]  and you know a man by his enemies and boy the enemies I mean Trump just
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:51.440]  absolutely enrages them and makes them show who they really are coming out
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.200]  hey here's a Hispanic couple a black couple they lost their children to
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:00.920]  vicious ms-13 humanizing them in the media viciously attacks him calls Trump
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:06.280]  a racist and defends ms-13 I mean he's making them unclog themselves and
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:12.840]  that's what's invaluable it was it was just priceless and for the black caucus
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:21.800]  to be so upset with Trump when this is the guy who has given an economic picture
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.440]  that has so improved the lives of so many blacks it's a near record low black
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.080]  unemployment and they just sat on their hands when he pointed to that fact
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:37.240]  amazing how the left is more interested in their cause they're not interested in
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.560]  people well look at the sullen faces of the black caucus those don't look like
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.680]  any black people anybody else I know it looks like people that were hired to
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:47.840]  come in and sell out their people and make sure they could abort as many as
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:52.800]  they could possibly God bless you Larry Pratt gun owners dot org we'll talk to

[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:39.200]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live I've got 16 clips from the state of the
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.440]  Union I want to play and that's not even all of it
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:46.600]  Trump arrives at the state of the Union and the stuff he says on the hot mics
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:52.800]  Trump says we're gonna release the memo 100% or you'd be too angry Americans
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:59.320]  are dreamers to Trump this is your time America Trump a new tide of optimism
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:04.160]  is sweeping our nation see we've been demoralized with all the race stuff and
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:09.400]  the sex stuff and the infighting and all the rest of it Trump is the opposite of
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.560]  a divider but the globalists say get rid of your country or you're a divider so
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.640]  they can conquer you know first he says we have a nation we have values we're
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:21.640]  inclusive we're America but we're not globalist and we're not communist and
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:24.880]  we're not any of these things and the people that hijacked this country are
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:31.160]  flipping out they were running a military destabilization and demoralization
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:36.600]  campaign people should think I was negative I was targeting them as the
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.720]  outside force showing how they were screwing us and telling you if we just
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:46.840]  got somebody in guaranteed recovery because it's artificial that's in all
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:52.000]  the documents it's artificial if you're holding somebody under the water and
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.120]  they're drowning I can guarantee that if you let them back up before they die
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:02.640]  they won't die so there's just so much to get into so much to break down ladies
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:08.840]  and gentlemen if you think that that truck just stole there by itself and
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.840]  that somebody didn't kill that guy and park it up there on the tracks that's
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.960]  how they like to do it the classic CIA tactic to you'll kill somebody have them
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.560]  in the car and remote control it into the next vehicle that is the standard
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.880]  assassination tool right now is they got remote control and all the new cars
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.320]  released a decade you kill an individual who doesn't have a background who's
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:32.880]  innocent and then of course they always end up dying and then that's how you do
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:38.600]  this type of stuff you ram somebody else's car with it that's even the movie
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.440]  like Sariana that's based on three-story George Clooney says I want you to kill
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.600]  him and then I want you to load him in a car I want you to run a truck into it a
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.840]  dump truck into it I mean this is standard dump truck I mean it's
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:50:02.920]  standard standard so I mean that is CIA playbook 100% unbelievable on the day
[01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:09.680]  after I gotta get to Trump here let's go ahead and this is your time America
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.000]  America and again the Democrats tweet how dare you talk about America and
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.880]  children and family and God this is horrible that's all gone that's what
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:25.880]  MSNBC said that's all gone and the statistic show record number of low
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:29.920]  families record number of people not having kids yeah you really messed us
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:35.160]  up you heard us real bad and now we're trying to crawl away like Russia has done
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:40.680]  and survived and you're pissed that you didn't finish the job rats but I swear
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.760]  I'm gonna expose you period and our listeners are gonna expose you let's go
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:56.520]  to the club here it is and he's a great welder I was told that by the man that
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:02.040]  owns that company that's doing so well so congratulations Corey since we pass
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:09.480]  tax cuts roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses many of
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:15.560]  them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker and it's getting more every
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:23.120]  month every week Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of 350
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:31.280]  billion dollars in America and hire another 20,000 workers those this is in
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:39.560]  his words he wrote almost all of us doesn't work those bonuses and the
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.920]  tax cuts show just how hard president Trump is working he had to call all
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.120]  those companies and coordinate this entire thing for those bonuses just a
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:53.280]  little while ago Exxon Mobil announced a 50 billion dollar investment in the United
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:52:06.240]  States just a little while this in fact is our new American moment there has
[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:12.680]  never been a better time to start living the American dream so to every citizen
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:17.320]  watching at home tonight no matter where you've been or where you've come
[01:52:17.320 --> 01:52:25.000]  from this is your time if you work hard if you believe in yourself if you believe
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:32.440]  in America then you can dream anything you can be anything and together we can
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:40.120]  achieve absolutely anything you know I think this is the best speech I've heard
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:45.520]  Trump give as far as acting very presidential and very professional and
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.840]  really doing a good job of getting that message across to the liberals how well
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:59.800]  he's helped our economy tonight I want to talk about what kind of future we're
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:06.680]  going to have and what kind of a nation we're going to be all of us together as
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:15.280]  one team one people and one American family can do anything we all share the
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:25.120]  same home the same heart the same destiny and the same great American flag
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:34.400]  powerful and I've got a bunch of other clips I want to play but let's play that
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.640]  clip one more time I've only played it at the first of the broadcast about an
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:43.080]  hour and 53 minutes ago of the president when he's leaving talking to a
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:50.000]  congressman saying please release the memo and Trump says oh 100% now the
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:57.960]  question is will the executive branch decide to redact any other and then if
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:04.080]  he doesn't do that if he just sits on it Congress can then override in eight days
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:10.800]  so we're talking next week we're talking next Monday that we're going to be able
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:15.880]  to see the contents of the roadmap of the criminal activity the Democratic
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.880]  Party has been caught in trying to destroy our electoral process and bring
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:25.480]  our country into a dictatorship run by Homeland Security sitting over the
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:30.120]  local towns and cities voting systems that is what Obama put on the books in
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:37.360]  the last days of office but here is the dramatic hot mic audio and video
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:54.000]  one of the biggest talking points they've got against him full wars and
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.640]  myself is after decades of warning of martial law and gun confiscation and
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.200]  plans to attack the family and all around and world government always made
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:07.280]  up stuff in the next show on the very program promotes that Jones now loves
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.520]  the government loves the military I always loved the military I was never
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.160]  against the police I wanted constitutional government I wanted my
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  country back being run by Americans for the nation for the people does that
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.400]  mean Trump's perfect I can't believe he got this much done he's got to work with
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:27.880]  Congress work with the courts and so many of them are opposing him but what's
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:33.120]  happening is the Republican leadership was told he would be removed in
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:38.400]  November or December they sat there on their hands until the the coup didn't
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:44.880]  take place and then Russiagate imploded and now like good little ducks the
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.920]  Republican leadership are getting in line because they know which way the
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:53.560]  wind's blowing and you see the whole thing shift the Saudi Arabian money's
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:57.240]  been cut off from the Democrats the Chinese money's getting cut off suddenly
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:00.280]  the New York Times and Washington Post admit every major university that's
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:04.640]  Democrat controlled is Chinese commie controlled that's coming out it's all
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.120]  gonna come out and people are gonna look back and go wow that's exactly what
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:13.320]  Alex Jones told us because I've studied and I only point out we're so right
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:19.680]  because they try to brand us fake news to destroy us that's why I need your

[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.160]  lines of the Info War
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:30.640]  I gotta tell you we're seeing big-time history right now in front of us we're
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:39.760]  seeing criminal cabals of private corporate leaders big foundations
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.200]  running people for college and and putting them into the system and then
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:48.160]  putting them into the CIA the FBI just like the Mafia is known for putting
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:51.120]  people in college and running them through to join the FBI or join the
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:59.600]  state police and we just got total infiltration but now these people are so
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:05.680]  hubris filled that they tried to bully everybody once we started doing this
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:10.360]  cancer operation to remove the face-sucking cancer and it's just
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:16.560]  accelerated their demise it is crazy I mean Trump's really been up at sixty
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:23.400]  percent polls I've gone over all that evidence and now they've got these polls
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:30.640]  at 70s the lowest on CNN some of them are at 79% CBS 75 and that's with
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.560]  oversampling Democrats you look at the different polls 9 to 15 points I mean
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:43.160]  we're talking 85 points people couldn't watch that and see him lay out
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.600]  actually watches immigration speeches he talked all the experts had a really
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:53.160]  reasonable pragmatic plan he understands we've got to bring in workers all the
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:58.560]  rest of it and then the media can't stand the globalist controlled media
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.440]  cannot stand that he gave a seven and a half minute breakdown of his totally
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:11.680]  reasonable pragmatic quite frankly very open immigration stance you just
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:16.080]  better not be a criminal or try to get on welfare right away and that's why
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.840]  some of the more right-wing groups that aren't optimistic and think that the
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.200]  folks being brought in from China and Mexico and we're gonna get brainwashed
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:29.000]  by leftist and you know they may be right I mean Trump may be wrong I may be
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.920]  wrong I'm just very optimistic I think hey you want to come here because there's
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:36.520]  a little bit of free market left right and this media is owned by the big
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.320]  banks and all it tells you all days to hate white people that's stupid white
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:43.800]  people are gonna be a minority they almost are most of them are old why
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:49.440]  don't you go enjoy yourself and and and you know have 500 flavors of ice cream
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:52.800]  hundreds of different phones hundreds of different doctors in each town
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.440]  hundreds of restaurants hundreds of everything and then you know all the
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.080]  just bitching about it constantly and opportunities that are just so crazy
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:06.320]  compared to everything else I mean are you really to see I'm not a racist I
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.680]  don't think you're stupid I think if I present these facts that hey these big
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:14.920]  mega banks that are tax exempt that are into all sorts of really evil stuff like
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:18.640]  pedophilia they're the ones that have looted these countries and had programs
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:24.920]  to not let them industrialize they admit in the UN population plan and the rest
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:30.640]  of it to not let you industrialize to control you and then they want to blow
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.920]  up whatever's left to not have any competition the globalist want total
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:39.960]  control like Elon Musk has said the tech heads are crazy they're in a cult they
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.640]  think they're God they're gonna merge the machine they're planning to get rid
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:50.360]  of everybody because he's been in there with them I just read their writings so
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:56.680]  I will guarantee you they're not your friend 100% 100% and they want to use
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:59.280]  tribalism and divide and conquer to control everybody I'm gonna come back
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.200]  and hit these clips then I'm gonna start getting your phone calls because in the
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:06.480]  fourth hour I'm gonna host I'm going to play large just segments from the start

[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.680]  the war room today I want these clips played I want them celebrated I mean we
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:22.600]  should name the clip here where Trump talks about what he really stands for
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:29.520]  dealing with the border his real immigration plan and then in his own
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:34.520]  words what Trump really says what they hope you don't see on immigration because
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.720]  right after he said all these things they had the usual suspects like Joy
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:44.880]  Reed on TV saying well you just heard him he says every immigrant's a murderer
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:50.720]  and every Mexican's evil he didn't say that you lion's sicko witch man you're
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:55.760]  the one getting pissed off anybody's got a family you damn witch

[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:39.400]  messianic and I'm not saying Trump is the deliverer like Moses when I say
[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:44.200]  messianic from going from Hillary and what we were facing and their plan to
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:48.320]  shut down the internet freedom and come after everybody and ban talk radio with
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:52.640]  fairness doctrine I mean they were announcing a total power grab America
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:07:03.680]  was on its death doorstep America was on its death bed and pragmatists that
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:08.360]  like freedom and free market and wealth and success just came in and said you
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:13.880]  lunatics that have got these giant you know what's on to rape the country it

[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:52.480]  much he hates all immigrants and says they're all criminals and trash I mean
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:08:01.680]  if I walked on a car dealership and Trump's saying this is a Ford F-150 pickup
[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:09.720]  with the basic package and it's $20,000 that's our lowest cost and you can
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.160]  check it online you might be able to get it shipped in from out of state
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:16.280]  somewhere but there'll be extra duties for 19,500 and I go do research is
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:19.320]  exactly like you said I go okay well this is a truck I'm looking for I'm gonna
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:26.720]  get it the Democrats who've got a gremlin for the 1970s with fire shooting out
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:32.720]  burning and they're telling me that it's a Lamborghini
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:37.400]  cuntosh or however you call them the cost of million dollars and I'm like man
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:42.560]  it's a rusted out gremlin like no socialism communism works wonderful
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:45.400]  and we're gonna take good care of you we're gonna and then you find out what
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:50.120]  they're all involved in like toasting $200 bottles of wine when they go I'm
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:54.720]  gonna get my Lamborghini can we sell these baby parts and it's just and
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:59.320]  they're like getting off on it they're not just doing bad they're like like
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:06.320]  witches and they've given into an evil spirit and that's why I keep going back
[02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:14.640]  I've got like four clips here I've only played one of them but I just can't get
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:18.960]  over I've got hundreds of articles here they're all incredibly important but I
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.360]  can't get over this this one article that's on drudgerport.com by Paul
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:29.560]  Joseph Watson from news wars.com MSNBC's Joy Reed triggered by Trump using the
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:37.600]  word family and then you read her sickening evil tweets church dot dot
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:44.080]  dot family dot dot dot police dot dot dot military dot dot dot see the site
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:48.800]  where first he's been trained in they've demonized the police and military okay
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:51.280]  because they want to overthrow what's left of the government bringing their own
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.400]  system where you'll really won't like the police and military and then they
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:58.760]  associate that with church and family first they demonize Pavlovian Lee with
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:03.400]  it five minutes of hate every day Orwell style police and military and the
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:06.800]  national anthem and then you know kneeling during it all of it then they
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:14.400]  add church and family and see that's how you do it it's it's next level and
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:19.960]  then she says you're trying to normalize the bygone era of church and family
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:26.560]  okay and that's what's in the textbooks it says in the CPS training manual
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:32.560]  textbooks I've shown on air it says the family belongs to the prehistoric era
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:37.760]  they actually believe you're born and go into a communal building and social
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.480]  engineers raise you and that's what the colleges are are the trigly puffs and
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:50.920]  all these zombies and then you read the documents they admit we're forming a
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:53.600]  post-human world because of our carbon footprint we're gonna merge with
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:57.280]  silicon to become AI gods but to do that we've got to make people just be
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:01.040]  derelicts that watch TV and play games all day while we slowly drug them and
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:04.880]  poison them ahead of larger forced population reductions but studies show
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.880]  many will opt in it's actually being euthanized after a certain point for
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.240]  several years of entertainment and fun and we'll have these future they're
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.640]  gonna have you sign contracts to be killed in the future you can be on
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.560]  welfare for 10 years and go to Vegas every day to everyone then you're gonna
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:22.680]  be then you're gonna die and you think I'm joking the announcements are about
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:28.680]  to come so I've got their whole plan from my own research and also from other
[02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:34.760]  sources but we are now the source for the CIA and the FBI see we've gone from
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:38.680]  that thing of the mad prophet out in the wilderness oh that's the nut you know
[02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:43.320]  until when it all comes true then you're in the palace see it's not a power
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.800]  trip you don't even want to be there because there's good people in the
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.720]  government there's also a lot of bad people and the operatives are inside
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:52.080]  there I don't want to be anywhere around it but yes we are the zeitgeist
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:57.080]  info wars is the flamethrower right in the middle of the enemy camp and they
[02:11:57.080 --> 02:12:01.960]  may censor and block us from all the trendies and the zombies and try to keep
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.320]  us from them and try to inoculate them against us while they suppress us while
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:10.560]  they block us while they don't let us share our links while they have it's
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.560]  like 10 TV shows attacking me every week now or sometimes five nights a week
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:18.480]  where they admit yes we play Alex Jones and then the guy gets up it's so
[02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:22.560]  original and goes I love the KKK and I hate black people and I'm Alex Jones
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:26.040]  they'll probably take that clip out blade out of context and then they'll say
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:32.280]  that as if they're me and the message is everybody else too you stick your head
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:35.840]  out and you stand up we're gonna destroy you like we've done Jones well you
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:41.320]  haven't destroyed me we are the zeitgeist in the White House we are the
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.360]  zeitgeist at the highest levels of intelligence agencies worldwide we are
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:50.160]  the channel that the people that actually know what's going on listen to
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:54.360]  because it's one of the only places they can tune in and hear something that's
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:00.120]  akin to what they are seeing day to day and what they are witnessing so when I
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:06.680]  tell you this I'm not bragging we're on the knife edge of total victory or total
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:10.640]  defeat the country in the world is not on that knife edge at this point we've
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.600]  moved back from the knife edge facing AI and other things down the road we'll be
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.560]  back on the knife edge again at those critical junctures and crossroads but
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:23.200]  info wars because of the tremendous power and the tremendous focus and the
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:29.320]  tremendous understanding of the system and the nexus point is under attack and
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:35.640]  by the way it's not safe to have this much influence even in the halls of the
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:41.860]  good guys because there's really sinister arguments down the road that
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:46.000]  gets into very complex political calculus you see I don't engage in
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.080]  complex political calculus I engage in the most sophisticated forms of
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.920]  information warfare which means go with the truth go with your gut let it all
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:14:00.760]  hang out and let the chips fall where it is and just tell it like it is and move
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:07.400]  forward because it's that innate gut level instinct reaction also back with
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:12.440]  research that is the deepest pools of knowledge this is Trump said the deepest
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:19.640]  thing he ever learned was to be shallow to stop self-checking and guessing and
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:23.760]  wondering and and and holding back and ignoring his gut that when he started
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:29.200]  going with his gut it was the deepest thing in his life exactly because it's
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.800]  not shallow it's your giant subconscious hundreds of times more powerful than
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.840]  your conscience all of your instincts all of your ancestors all of it telling
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:45.480]  you what's really going on so they try to bombard you with fake stuff in fake
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:48.760]  news and fake entertainment to program your subconscious with all these
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.840]  dramas and shows and you know the new ex files character and the new I mean all
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:58.560]  every new drama movie science fiction movie orange is the new black they've
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:04.040]  got characters or people they've chosen that are in Alex Jones who then say all
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.880]  this crazy stuff and then turns out not to be true so that's that's a full-on
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:16.000]  inoculation so I've been chosen in the deck of cards to be the person that they
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.720]  try to destroy and if they can destroy me they believe they can destroy you now
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:27.600]  there was a real shot across the bow to this Chris Carter said no I like Alex
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.320]  Jones he's not a racist he's a good guy I'm gonna put out a positive portrayal
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.480]  of Alex Jones in the last season and the rest of it and so again you have to
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:38.960]  understand it's not about us about why they're just talking about me all day
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:46.520]  it's about why are they doing it because they intend to destroy me and in that
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:51.160]  destroy a card from the deck which if they knew anything they ought to know
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:57.280]  they can't even do we'll be right back here's a special message for those of

[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:41.720]  democrats are threatened republicans on television that you better not release
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.760]  the memo that trump says he's a hundred percent gonna release said that at the
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:47.120]  end of the state of the union last night when he was leaving we've played the
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.960]  video several times it's on info wars dot com and they keep saying you do this
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:54.480]  there's gonna be massacres well we already know the democrats have tried to
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:57.960]  massacre the republican leadership of patriots while they were playing
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:01.520]  baseball we've seen all the other attacks and bizarre behavior and ran
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:05.440]  ball getting attacked I mean take hours to go over all of it so kit daniel's is
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:09.880]  posted an article GOP train crash was deep state warning republicans to jump
[02:21:09.880 --> 02:21:16.560]  off the train the trump train was GOP train crash completely accidental or the
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.840]  circumstantial evidence point to something else and that's a great
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:23.920]  headline kit but I would add somewhere in here what you have in the article
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:29.600]  in 2016 popular science reported that train systems were vulnerable to hacking
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:33.520]  yeah after highlighting a study by German cybersecurity researchers who
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:38.760]  warned that train warning signals could be compromised to cause accidents
[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:45.720]  absolutely and again what you do is you kill the driver with a fast-acting drug
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:50.240]  that dissipates out of the bloodstream you drive up you park it you turn the
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:54.960]  signals off or you remote control the vehicle into the train but they're now
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:59.160]  saying it was stalling the tracks again this is all real this is what's this has
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:04.400]  been declassified in fact it's in the vault seven documents and vault eight
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:09.120]  documents about hijacking cars to kill people I mean they've got Hollywood
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:13.040]  movies like seriana about three stories where I want you to get him I want you to
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:16.000]  kill him I want you to put him in the front of a car and I want you to ram it
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.680]  with a dump truck I mean that's what you do that's how you kill people is in
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:25.200]  fake auto accidents that's the number one way to do it if you don't want a
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:31.960]  big investigation another big thing they do is they'll they'll hit your car
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:36.600]  pretty hard and they'll usually hire an illegal alien the people get paid to do
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:40.640]  this to ride in the car when it happens but they'll have a bigger car they'll
[02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:44.520]  ram the car the person isn't dead the illegals told to flee the scene and
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:48.440]  other it's usually rural areas another car pulls up kill the person that's
[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:51.960]  living with Diana she was alive and finally put her back at the ambulance
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:56.440]  and then they get you they shoot you up and then you know you're off to the
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:00.360]  races right there and then police show up you're dead in the car there's been
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:04.320]  famous cases of husbands I saw one on unsolved mysteries kind of nostalgic so
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:13.720]  I'm watching that series with my son sometimes and he he knocks her off the
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:20.000]  horse then he gives her this horse tranquilizer kills her beats her head in
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.360]  the rocks make it look like she fought the horse they exhumed her body find the
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:27.440]  drugs busted because they found he was a con artist I mean there have been
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:33.800]  thousands of cases in America of men doing this to their wives okay so don't
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:39.800]  tell me we shouldn't look at this this is how this is done and the media will
[02:23:39.800 --> 02:23:44.760]  spin and say Joe says the dump truck driver did it and then they'll like out
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:47.560]  you know put the family on TV it's how they work it won't matter what I really
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:51.240]  said they'll just say that Joe's is the one that said the dump truck driver did
[02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:55.800]  it no I'm saying they could remote control it and then and then have him
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:24:00.600]  run onto the tracks or they could kill him put him in the vehicle remote
[02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:04.320]  control it up there or kill him drive it up on the tracks themselves get off and
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:10.520]  leave I mean look at the train they just hit it's a total message I'm ranting and
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.360]  I've got so much other news to get to and see why I'm mad about the train not
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:17.840]  just the dead person in the 20 something 30 something injured Republican
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:22.240]  leadership as a message it distracts everything from the huge state of the
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:25.920]  Union and the big issues that were there what was really said it's now the big
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:32.560]  story because it's the Republican leadership hit by a garbage truck
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:38.480]  hit by a dump truck garbage truck it's both a dump truck is a garbage truck it's
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:44.480]  just a dump truck that carries garbage a trash truck is still a dump truck by any
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:49.360]  other name a rose is still a rose so there's the headline was GOP train
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:54.040]  targeted by cyber attack 2016 popular science report the train systems are
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:25:01.280]  vulnerable to cyber attacks again because the train would know this this track
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:08.280]  we've got the report does have the sensors oh but he didn't slow down isn't
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:13.560]  that interesting do you believe any of this come on folks okay here's the toll
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:24.560]  free number to join us 877-789 Alex 877-789-ALEX 877-789-ALEX 877-789-2539
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:29.720]  and by the way if you disagree you go to the head of the line if you're a
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:34.720]  liberal or Democrat or someone that really doesn't like the president that
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:38.680]  doesn't mean you call in just you want to you say I'm a Bill Hicks or something
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:42.480]  stupid and then you go to have lines people cheat on the call screening they
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:45.480]  don't really screen your calls but sometimes I do I say hey I want these
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:48.560]  topics and hey I want to discuss what do you think of the state of the union
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:53.160]  whether the crazy Democrat response what was the craziest Democrat response I
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:58.920]  mean they went completely nuts they're crazier than I thought don't they even
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:03.680]  get how this looks why can't they control themselves because lying and
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:07.320]  sneaking didn't work now they're showing us who they are accelerating their
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:11.400]  political destruction so what was the craziest Democrat thing did you like
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.640]  Bernie Sanders response didn't even work of course as a socialist 90% of it was
[02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:22.880]  cut out and now the socialist communist response doesn't work and and the
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.720]  Democrat response was spit all over his mouth all this craziness and then what
[02:26:26.720 --> 02:26:35.360]  Trump really said versus how the media spun it 877789 Alex 877892539 and your
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:42.000]  phone calls are coming up and then the whole next fourth hour I'm hosting I'm
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.640]  gonna play clip after clip of the president right into the war room and
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:47.600]  the rest of it but I'm gonna play some of that too after we go to some of your
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:54.160]  phone calls but this is a date of long remember in a big way listen I'm not
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:57.880]  gonna belabor this people are excited about it it's selling out that's great
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:02.760]  but we don't make a ton of money on us we need to sell a lot of it I was gonna
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:09.320]  come out with DNA Force plus with Dr. Group who we've worked on with this with
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:13.040]  the CoQ 10 the bio PQQ and some of the other key compounds for optimal
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:20.440]  absorption cell it's known to help the telomeres not shorten as fast it's
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.640]  done for cell regrowth hundreds of studies totally backing just the bio
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:28.680]  PQQ alone and this is a huge dose of it most of it synthetic and they still 50
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.360]  bucks for a tiny little bottle of little bitty pills that you don't even sort
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:41.040]  well this is $70 now even though when I was doing DNA Force it was costing us
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:47.440]  45 to $60 was it varied each batch what the stuff was in the market that's how
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:50.480]  good this is well we were able to with one of the top firms in the country
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:55.080]  lower the price that it cost us almost by half but I didn't want to step on
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:27:59.560]  groups toes so I said we'll still have DNA Force he said Alex it's fine you got
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:03.520]  with the top company it's really great I'm out of it you're wonderful we'll

[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:14.200]  whatever so cell force is DNA Force plus just DNA Force plus isn't out yet and
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:18.680]  so group so classy he published such a great formula he said listen I'm glad

[02:32:51.160 --> 02:32:53.560]  country back
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:33:04.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:26.480]  you've got it we've got it we're going to war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:38.280]  to you live you know we've never had this happen before and I'm not saying it's
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:43.160]  a conspiracy but they built backdoors into everything they've given the
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:46.880]  Democratic Party and people like reality winner keys and backdoors to all the
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:52.120]  major computer systems for COG for continuity of government but you can
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:56.560]  use anything like that to bring everything down it's like the Snowden film
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:03.560]  that was advised by the former technical head of the NSA William Benning that
[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:07.760]  whole operation shows how the computer chips sent out for power plants and
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:13.160]  hospitals and everything has backdoors so the US government can just shut
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:18.680]  everything down in Japan in Germany but they in tune sell us chips do the same
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:24.640]  thing I mean it is just so corrupt so evil so dangerous so bad and the word
[02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.640]  is Trump saying that's all stopping that's part of the agreements as well
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:32.960]  he calls that be a bureaucracy and backstabbing so it just shows how crazy
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:38.600]  is we've never had the phone system go down on its own not the internet the
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:43.640]  phone system went down the phone box crashed at the same time that the
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:48.200]  computer system that runs the audio for the show that's why you didn't hear
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:51.800]  music going out it's why you didn't hear music coming in we're having to hand
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:58.680]  fire it right now off of a backup system so it's probably just a glitch but two
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:03.720]  separate systems not even plugged into each other at the same minute go down
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:07.720]  imagine when all the driverless cars are in place and the driverless planes and
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:13.280]  the robots are in charge what if there's a giant meteor shower and it knocks out
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:18.320]  the wrong satellites and things go haywire just the possibility of malfunctioning
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:23.800]  like we keep seeing with these trains is incredible so we've relaunched the phone
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:28.000]  system specifically your comments on the state of the union specifically your
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.960]  comments on what was the craziest thing the Democrats said or did maybe you
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:34.920]  disagree with the president maybe thought something said was wrong you will
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:43.480]  talk to you as well 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 and I hope the phone system
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:49.120]  doesn't go down again only goes down about twice a year some it's a pretty
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:55.200]  stable top-of-the-line system we've got okay that's a great system to it can
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:58.480]  take like a hundred phone calls at once one time we open the phones up and we
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:03.800]  had 24,000 calls because it can tell you how many hit them a hit the deal I mean
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:07.880]  a national talk shows are begging for callers so we've just got so many great
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:12.440]  callers we're gonna be going to you guys here in just a few minutes because I got
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:17.760]  cut off by break I didn't finish up telling you about cell force we could
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:24.920]  get a better deal with a top lab on the bio PQQ the CoQ to the other compounds
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:30.640]  and have it pass California standards which is nearly impossible if we went
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:35.920]  with a big national lab well I developed DNA force for Dr. Group and my dad
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:40.240]  basically off the top stuff that was selling for three four five times at
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.400]  medical clinics but wasn't prescription I said why are why is it 400 bucks we can
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:47.960]  you know buy it for 50 bucks and sell it for a hundred bucks and you know fund
[02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:52.200]  her operation and undercut the whole market which we've done well then we
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:56.200]  were able to get it for even less so now I guess the retail won't be a hundred
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:59.440]  and forty nine I guess it'll start being like you know a hundred dollars and then
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:04.360]  we can discount it for 60 or 70 dollars so this is DNA force plus will be the
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:08.080]  name when it comes out but it's called cell force right now because I didn't
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:10.920]  want to do that to group and the reason I'm telling this long convoluted story
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:17.200]  is that's how I'm explaining is it cell force because really DNA force plus and
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:21.080]  and I was developing that with group he said there's no way I can do this at this
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:24.840]  price you've done a great job it's a great formula just take the product over
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:29.520]  yourself so that's what we're doing cell force is a limited run when it's gone
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:33.280]  it'll be discounted usually at about eighty ninety dollars which is an
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:36.600]  incredible deal for this I mean let me tell you something they don't put thirty
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:39.800]  forty dollars a product of something and then and then you know sell it for
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:43.640]  hundred dollars I mean we were putting fifty five sixty bucks depending on the
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:47.040]  run in it and discounting it like eighty bucks the accountant's going man this is
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:49.920]  why I can't fund your operation you're bringing in a ton of money but most of
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:54.480]  it's in the cost of the product so yeah yeah millions of dollars come in but
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:57.960]  ninety percent of it or eighty percent of it is the cost of the product you
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:03.960]  got to stop it oh here's an example we sell colloidal silver when it's on sale
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:07.760]  for fourteen ninety five usually twenty bucks the same stuff sold for twenty five
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:11.520]  dollars at Whole Foods it's the highest quality thirty parts per million when we
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:15.480]  discount it's a super sale it's nine ninety five so that's our colloidal
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:20.560]  silver it's nineteen ninety five right now already a great deal so info or store
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.000]  dot com and force life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  we've got bodies the new ultimate turmeric form four hundred plus milligrams
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:35.920]  per caplet the curcumin in reading on is ninety five percent curcumin in leading
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:39.960]  competitors are three percent that's why it took us years to finally bring you
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:46.600]  the ultimate turmeric formula bodies whole body support we're gonna change the
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:51.960]  bottle label later I got busy and didn't have ultimate turmeric on the bottle is
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:55.560]  gonna say that in the next run but that's what we're out to do bring you the
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:59.640]  very best at twenty nine ninety five leading competitors ladies and gentlemen

[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:29.280]  I'm gonna get next hour into a bunch of clips we haven't gotten to yet from the
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.920]  powerful state of the union that the globalist couldn't stand was on air
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:38.200]  couldn't stand had record ratings and he would say something loving and and and
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:42.600]  you know very conciliatory and very unifying and they would say oh he's a
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:46.800]  horrible racist in all Mexicans or criminals he didn't say any of that and
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.560]  shouldn't people be insulted being lied to like that it's incredible so here's
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:58.040]  the big mom show news we haven't broken yet it's up on news wars dot com need to
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:03.280]  get this out please everybody because we're in a war Trump and I know most of
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:05.600]  you know that they're sick of hearing and I'm talking to new listeners that
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:08.680]  don't get it okay that's why I repeat some of the same stuff I've got five
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:12.920]  hundred articles here hours of tape I could talk five minutes like other
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:17.680]  talk shows do they're scared to be on air I'm still hitting the millions of new
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:21.160]  people that tune in each week so they understand this is a total war they're
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:26.240]  totally needed to totally get informed and get involved or we're gonna lose but
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.360]  I know it's obnoxious even to myself to listen sometimes rebroadcast cuz you know
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:33.240]  I kind of repeat some of the same things because it's the truth and without you
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:38.120]  we're nobody and you see things turning around just as we knew the hypothesis
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:41.640]  if globalism is artificial and designed to make you poor to control you and
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.920]  designed to leverage Western wealth into third-world nations to not empower
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:50.360]  those people not make them trading partners but enslave them to control
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.600]  them and then leverage their anger against you to bring you completely down
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:58.840]  as well so the breakaway civilization can dominate all of us after we get
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:03.320]  sucked into that whirlpool we've got to expose the real operation and believe
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:06.400]  the people are smart enough to understand what's happened so we can turn
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:11.280]  this around and one year in baby it's proven and in other countries it's
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:15.680]  already happening and it's instant turnarounds because human potential is
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:21.760]  unlimited we have been artificially under neo feudalism kept in a position of
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:28.560]  poverty and control and cultural poverty and spiritual poverty by the globalist
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:34.880]  of their poison Hollywood soul rot and we're coming out of it we're breaking
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:41.280]  out of it ladies and gentlemen this is it this is it you want to live you want
[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:46.760]  to be free we must break out now because we're gonna face the AI we're gonna face
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:50.640]  our even if we're all good people the technology's gonna be so advanced we're
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:54.000]  gonna kill ourselves with it we're gonna have that Atlantis moment I talk
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.400]  about so we better get together we better try to be good we better get
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:02.400]  focused are none of us have a future I don't care what color you are here's the
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:08.600]  article Trump reminds lawmakers you serve America first because here's the
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:12.360]  deal they're all they're gonna serve somebody like Bob Dylan says they're
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:16.800]  gonna serve the Communist Chinese or the corrupt Vatican or or or or Microsoft
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:24.760]  if they don't serve their families and their country and justice you will have
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.640]  a God and if you don't say there's a God above you the state will become a God
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:34.120]  that's why so many atheists but we had his founding fathers some were atheists
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:36.720]  most were Christians or let's just say there's they didn't know that the
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:40.280]  scientists but they said but we still want a God above the king and the
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.220]  government so that we we become a God and I don't mean that in a satanic way
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:49.320]  little G when we put something above the state then we say no it's up there to
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:56.040]  reach for not the state up here as the God because we know it's not God in full
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:59.680]  war's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine we have found

[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:05.240]  though I mean I hardly work out anymore and I and I weigh less than I did ten
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:09.800]  years ago I mean it's just what it did to my metabolism my skin I used to get
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:14.120]  sunspots I got a lot of sun my sunspots went away I mean I'm like old person you
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:18.040]  know brown spots because I would fish a lot and hike a lot and you know go water
[02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:21.920]  skin and stuff and it just I got but thank you so much for your support but
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:26.480]  yeah the x2 really is amazing well what was your take gem on the whole state of
[02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:33.880]  the Union I was just astounded that it you know how he tells us so many good
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:37.320]  things that are happening you know I've been alive I'm a little older than you
[02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:40.160]  and I've been alive long enough to see enough presidents who don't keep their
[02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:47.400]  word and these the first guy who has and it's so refreshing and then to see how
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:55.600]  you know the wrong side of the aisle where I live it's just like there it's
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:02.960]  like they're evil almost you know that you can't see the good in this and you
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:09.320]  don't even want to support this when it you know my life got better you know and
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:14.680]  and and for everybody and they really aren't like villains I used to be a
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:18.640]  kid and read about villains in books or movies about that's dumb that isn't how
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:22.080]  it is people just don't do evil stuff when doing good would be better for them
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:25.600]  and now that I've grown up and experienced stuff no all the villains the
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:30.480]  stuff and fairy tales those are art types of just how it is I mean I used to
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:34.600]  read like FBI indictments the criminals and stuff and think there's no way they
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:38.280]  did all that they're just demonizing people to the jury and then I've
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:42.720]  experienced stuff in my own wife now where people will go out of their way to
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:47.760]  screw you over even though it hurts them they just want to hurt people and
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:53.000]  that's why those of us that aren't out to get people we're not perfect we're just
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.200]  not to get people I mean I think I'll be Trump 2020 he's not out to get you I
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:02.240]  mean just you know not out to get us and there's so many people though that are
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:07.520]  literally so angry that they just hate everybody and feel good if they see you
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:12.280]  pulled down does that make sense yeah well and you know I'm a Bible reader and
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:16.120]  you read that the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one and I've
[02:51:16.120 --> 02:51:21.720]  always wondered to see how you were gonna see that actually come out and you
[02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:26.040]  know it's like you know he's got to have his fingers you know Satan's got to have
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:29.560]  his fingers in the government somehow and so you start looking at the going is
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:34.520]  that how it's coming out these people are just these hateful evil you know we
[02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:39.440]  want you're never gonna find anything good in a guy who's basically saving you
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:45.040]  and what did you think of three different pundits I've got clips of coming
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:49.520]  out and saying how dare him talk about family and church we don't have that
[02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:57.840]  anymore that's by God I mean families they had told you they hate families
[02:51:57.840 --> 02:52:02.520]  they want to get rid of them the greatest thing Satan ever did was get
[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:06.520]  the majority of people out there to believe he doesn't exist and brother you
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:14.440]  said it and there's something messianic about what's happening here and I know
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:18.080]  what it is we are about to face our real challenges we're gonna look back on
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:23.120]  this and think well this was easy but it was hard to get to this point we're
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:26.480]  gonna have more confidence now but it's because we're gonna fight a hundred foot
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:30.640]  giant a decade from now it's gonna be a thousand feet then a trillion feet tall
[02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:34.960]  and we're gonna really face some times brother that's when I'm getting that God
[02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:38.560]  bless you I appreciate your call oh I noticed you were also asking on the
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:42.000]  board it said when will the memo be released the president said he will do
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:46.040]  it a hundred percent he has what is it seven eight days to release it from the
[02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:52.040]  time and so that was a couple days ago when they voted so let me let me break
[02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:57.360]  that down my sources told me no one's sure yet but they think Monday he's not
[02:52:57.360 --> 02:53:01.920]  gonna he's gonna kind of let the state of the union thing be there and then build
[02:53:01.920 --> 02:53:07.040]  up the memo and release it sometime next week they think Monday just like I
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:10.240]  was told last week they're gonna vote Monday and then five days later they
[02:53:10.240 --> 02:53:13.360]  said yeah we're gonna vote on Monday again my sources aren't a hundred percent
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:19.280]  because they don't know that even though they are people in Congress here's the
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:39.680]  club of the president so you can see Trump high as a kite no drugs just
[02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:45.400]  smiling and just see I'm not as positive as Trump I like to fight tyrants and
[02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:48.920]  stuff I know you do as well but I get too pessimistic just dealing with it and
[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:55.440]  I've got to make it fun we got to make it more of a joke I mean Trump I'm so
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:54:00.680]  disillusioned with Hollywood I can care less about it I'm so disillusioned with
[02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:05.240]  all of it none of it means anything it really is just family and being a good
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:09.280]  person and being able to support yourself it's what life's all about but
[02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:12.880]  then somebody like Trump comes on the stage you know he's under attack he's
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:17.040]  going through hell he's working so hard his family's working so hard he's so
[02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:22.080]  good and then they're saying he's so bad because they're that bad that's what
[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:28.000]  hurts me is I can't believe Pelosi when they said let's work together was
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:34.200]  shaking her head when Trump is trying to give them DACA and then again the right
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:38.720]  wing says well you backed out you lied he said Obama's DACA is total
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:42.400]  legalization of anybody that wants to come here calling 40 year old men kids
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:46.920]  with criminal records is not happening a lot of criminals coming across you can't
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:50.640]  just leave a lot that turns into I hate all Mexicans all Mexicans are
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:55.240]  criminals that's what they said it again last night and then he's like no if
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:58.120]  you've lived here a long time aren't a criminal we're gonna make it quicker for
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:03.000]  you to be a citizen absolutely we want to vet people we're gonna make it easier
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:06.160]  to be a citizen you're gonna be vetted you're not gonna get brainwashed against
[02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:10.200]  the country up front you're gonna at least have a chance to make your own
[02:55:10.200 --> 02:55:13.320]  decision about how you want to be politically and that's what he said the
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:20.160]  whole seven-minute breakdown and it's very reasonable that turns into Trump
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:25.880]  hates all the Mexicans it's not true that's univision owned by big mega banks
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:30.640]  owned by kingpins owned by narcotics traffickers the New York Times all of it
[02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:35.000]  they are the greedy enemies they're the people worth hundreds of billions of
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:42.560]  dollars Jeff Bezos with Warren Buffett and with Bill Gates want to have a
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:47.000]  Thomas computer the same ones that are over the veterans affairs till Trump
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.680]  stopped it with bioethics deciding when to not give you health care and kill
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:56:02.000]  you but CNN has it the dream team to fix health care Bezos diamond and Buffett and
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.240]  I know the whole background of them they're all pushing eugenics care where
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:11.360]  they way overcharge everybody and then if you don't have money they just kill

[03:00:57.720 --> 03:01:00.760]  hours at night because the coast is on but by the end of the year and that means
[03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:04.120]  I've only got 11 months down to get it going. I've got to hire all these people

[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.440]  go ahead and who's who's disagrees. Josh you and Orrin let me put you kind of
[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:41.320]  ahead of the line because I've missed that go ahead. Hey can you hear me Alex?
[03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:47.920]  Yes sir. Okay yeah I mean yeah I guess I sort of disagree what I want to what I
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:51.880]  want to say is first off I thought the State of the Union speech I thought it
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:55.720]  was great I'm definitely a you know conservative libertarian I'm a big fan
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:59.640]  of Trump in a lot of ways. One thing I'm a little concerned with though is how
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:03.640]  the immigration situation is being handled. I do know that I'm pretty sure at
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:06.240]  least that what he's doing is he's trying to put forward this deal that he
[03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:09.840]  knows the Democrats won't take because they're gonna put you know the having
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.240]  unsecured borders. Well you're a smart guy that he had Conway and others say that
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:18.040]  he put forward something that's reasonable and they went no total open
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:25.200]  borders you're a Nazi so there you go. Yeah no absolutely it just it just
[03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:28.120]  concerns me I just hate that we're at this point in our country where we have
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:32.920]  to you know bargain about our security then the security of our nation. No I
[03:02:32.920 --> 03:02:37.320]  hear you here's the deal he's not a dictator and I don't want the president
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:40.720]  to be okay because even if he was a great guy they put a dictatorship in and
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:43.840]  then they'd assassinate him and then he'd have some horrible person in because
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:47.600]  you can have you know philosopher kings for a while and the golden errors happen
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:50.520]  sometimes when you get a good guy that's like to take Putin he doesn't have a
[03:02:50.520 --> 03:02:54.480]  dictatorship he's elected but if he was a dictator then they remove him who knows
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:57.600]  what happens after that when you get a different dictator so you know one guy
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:01.640]  dies you get another but here's the deal he's got a compromise I can't believe
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:07.840]  he got a bill this good through because you've got those so-called moderate
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:11.440]  which means establishment Republicans if we had a bigger freedom caucus in there
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:15.040]  we'd have the real trifecta he doesn't have really all three branches of
[03:03:15.040 --> 03:03:21.200]  government right now the courts are in rebellion against him the Senate is in
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:24.680]  rebellion half the time so I mean I'm surprised he's been able to bug you with
[03:03:24.680 --> 03:03:29.760]  this much what do you think and listen there 800,000 a million whatever there
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:32.920]  are a bunch of people been here 20 30 years and aren't citizens that work and
[03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:38.160]  have jobs I say there's fast-tracked citizenship for them and then get an
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:41.600]  education program about America going instead of giving this whole
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:45.000]  race-baiting narrative the Democrats I get they want to bring in different
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  demographics brainwash them and then have a whole anti-white agenda as the
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:54.520]  basis of their new political apparatus we just have to take the high road and I
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:57.800]  think checkmate them by explaining that but you know what maybe I'm wrong what
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:02.640]  do you think no no I totally understand I mean in this political climate it's
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:06.360]  become so you know so toxic because of the mainstream media because of the
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:10.760]  sort of establishment culture that is completely against Trump it's still
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:14.680]  aligned against them that you have to be very you know very careful if you have
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:19.920]  to you have to sort of play this game where you really got to be careful about
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:24.240]  everything that's done instead because there's a lot of research to be free and
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:28.320]  be informed you're absolutely right well I'll tell you the big secret is it's not
[03:04:28.320 --> 03:04:32.200]  a secret now and I almost don't like it it's so authoritarian but Mexico was
[03:04:32.200 --> 03:04:36.640]  collapsing into us and was bringing authoritarianism the CIA the FBI the

[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:51.440]  just they just took the whole Mexican mafia everything else and just wiped it
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:53.560]  out

[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:51.400]  proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our

[03:06:56.880 --> 03:07:04.560]  people that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never
[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:19.360]  happen again the Democrats don't want to stand for that because they know they're
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:23.840]  to blame the Democrats don't want to support those victims families because
[03:07:23.840 --> 03:07:26.520]  they know they're partially to blame because they're open border policies
[03:07:26.520 --> 03:07:34.080]  compassionate nation we are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere
[03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:39.880]  in the world to help the needy the struggling and the underprivileged all
[03:07:39.880 --> 03:07:46.000]  over the world but as president of the United States my highest loyalty my
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:53.200]  greatest compassion my constant concern is for America's children America's
[03:07:53.200 --> 03:08:00.000]  struggling workers and America's forgotten communities I want our youth to
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:08.000]  grow up to achieve great things I want our poor to have their chance to rise so
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:12.960]  tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties
[03:08:12.960 --> 03:08:19.800]  Democrats and Republicans to protect our citizens of every background color
[03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:43.520]  religion and creed my duty and the sacred duty of every elected official in
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:50.160]  this chamber is to defend Americans to protect their safety their families their
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:56.480]  communities and their right to the American dream because Americans are
[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:13.760]  dreamers too those homeless Americans are dreamers as well
[03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:38.880]  this is a difficult task many have spent the last year
[03:09:39.680 --> 03:09:45.980]  you're sad for your f***ing sad look at you look at your piece of s*** you can't
[03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:50.240]  even tell me the definition of a f***ing word you're uneducated mother f***er I
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:57.080]  got the great f***ing engineer I got a head no you don't right here no you don't
[03:10:06.360 --> 03:10:17.240]  disturb me and that is a clip of Joe Kennedy the third spitting and licking
[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:23.200]  his lips and then other Democrat goblin creatures Lord Jabba and spit man as
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:32.040]  he's known out there screaming and Owen shroyer and Daria and screaming give me
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:36.120]  a hot cup of coffee I'm gonna dump it on we're going back to your phone calls
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:39.720]  right now it's the fourth hour I'm your host Alex Jones coming up the war room
[03:10:39.720 --> 03:10:46.760]  with Owen shroyer we do not have Roger Stone on the stake as he is gonna be
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:52.960]  addressing the Oxford Union the Oxford faculty over an Oxford a coveted
[03:10:52.960 --> 03:10:57.600]  historical speaking spot and whether it's today or tomorrow we're gonna get
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:01.840]  the HD tape of it we will air the speech here you better believe your bottom
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:06.120]  dollar we're talking about Trump right now about all the crazy stuff that
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:10.080]  happened listen I know dump trucks get stuck on railroad tracks but this train
[03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:14.840]  with the Speaker of the House and a bunch of Republicans going through that
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:20.160]  area of Virginia Charlottesville and then there's a dump truck stuck a trash
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:24.960]  truck stuck on the tracks the driver one person killed another couple are
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:29.760]  injured and then a bunch of people injured on the train I just saw the
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:33.560]  video earlier Fox News was showing they finally got the dump truck out of the
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:38.360]  way and the train is now moving back down the tracks so this is just crazy
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:42.720]  we'll follow it again they can remote control these things they can turn the
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:47.760]  centers off of the tracks all I'm saying is Democrats keep saying there's gonna
[03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:50.840]  be blood in the streets they're gonna get the Republican leadership they
[03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:55.800]  already shot a bunch of people up and almost kills police so I look at all
[03:11:55.800 --> 03:12:00.640]  these things like that and so I'm not saying it was that I'm saying it needs
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:06.840]  very suspicious okay let's go ahead and speaking of the train go to Gary in
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:14.120]  Vancouver Washington you're on the year go ahead hey Alex can you hear me okay yes sir yes I
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:20.320]  mean think of it statistically if it was a random accident I mean for every
[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:25.120]  one dump truck on the road there's probably you know thousands of sedan
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:30.000]  vehicles smaller vehicles and if you wanted to do an accident take a train
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:35.720]  off the track you're gonna use a heavy vehicle and then it's this train how
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:41.080]  many trains run a day surface trains that aren't subways it's it's in the
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:45.080]  thousands thousands of trains running day after the state of the Union the
[03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:50.720]  Republican leadership on a train and then this happens it's just or or if it
[03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:57.360]  isn't foul play it's a serious omen what do you think yeah I mean just hire a
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:01.560]  statistician they could give you a statistical number on the odds of that
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:06.360]  happening and my next question is are there black boxes on these newer
[03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:12.360]  vehicles that we can forensically go back in and find out if how it actually
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:16.560]  happened because the guy all we have to do is if you didn't push on that
[03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:21.720]  accelerator pedal but the thing took off on our own that should be recorded in
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:26.840]  the black box well we learned this with Vegas when we now know we were told a
[03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:30.360]  lie it was an Islamic attack they were having the Saudi Arabian military
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:33.520]  convention there that week they use that as the cover to get operatives in they
[03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:39.520]  then used a known Middle Eastern gun runner as their connection to get guns
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:43.560]  in the country so they could attack and then set him up as a message to Trump I
[03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:47.360]  got that first from the FBI not the complete story but but that him go in
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:50.720]  the Middle East being a gun runner there being more shooters all that I was
[03:13:50.720 --> 03:13:55.280]  from the hostage rescue team Patriots and then it all sort of coming out later
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:13:58.560]  we got it from Congress we got it from other sources and we got it from Zach
[03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:01.840]  by the way let's call Zach he said call him in a few weeks that was a few weeks
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:05.360]  ago I know who Zach is he's been on television before he's well known
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:12.400]  intelligence operative in the US Army now doing other work and Zach you know
[03:14:12.400 --> 03:14:16.760]  it's laid out the whole deal and later it all came out so there are thousands
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:20.280]  and thousands and thousands of trains running a day I'm trying to I'm not how
[03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:25.920]  much just Amtrak is total trains running but as is 2025 a day so I was
[03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:29.560]  guessing thousands but crossing collisions and casualties by a year I
[03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:33.520]  don't know these statistics looking up yourself it's very very rare thank you
[03:14:33.520 --> 03:14:39.480]  Gary Nathan in Tennessee you're on the air worldwide thank you for holding from
[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:45.320]  the volunteer state it's an honor to speak with you Alex and I want to say
[03:14:45.320 --> 03:14:51.240]  God bless you thank you for all the work no thank you and I want to thank Mr.
[03:14:51.240 --> 03:14:57.440]  Trump president from commander-in-chief Trump for everything that he's doing I
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:02.880]  enjoyed his speech that to me there were no bombshells because there was there
[03:15:02.880 --> 03:15:06.400]  was nothing that he did that came to a surprise to me at all you know make
[03:15:06.400 --> 03:15:09.600]  complete sense to me it was straight shooting great I mean it's straight
[03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:12.880]  shooting good you just you know it you know what the plan on it's straight
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:19.080]  shooting exactly and it made sense to me and and it's just amazing how there's
[03:15:19.080 --> 03:15:23.560]  the other side just does not understand it all just does not compute with them
[03:15:23.560 --> 03:15:27.080]  at all it's just really illustrates what we're up against because they're a bunch
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:30.680]  of spoiled rotten out-of-control babies stay there because I see one about lack
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:35.320]  of veteran talk in the speech that there wasn't a lot of that there's been
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:40.320]  action though they've doubled the amount of actual surgeries and things vets are
[03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:43.840]  getting there trying to clean it up democratic operatives inside the VA all

[03:20:28.560 --> 03:20:33.880]  train-train GOP lawmakers was a kamikaze attack on republicans no I said
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:38.240]  was the truck used like a kamikaze I've been totally clear could have been a
[03:20:38.240 --> 03:20:41.440]  heart attack could have got stuck on the tracks could have been the sensors
[03:20:41.440 --> 03:20:44.280]  being turned off could have been somebody being killed put in the car
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:49.240]  parked on there I simply talked about how the CIA and others have done this in
[03:20:49.240 --> 03:20:53.880]  the past and I was very clear let's see they snippet it just like I knew they
[03:20:53.880 --> 03:20:58.680]  would that's what george soros does let's look at the other article please
[03:20:58.680 --> 03:21:05.360]  we just track these people unhinged alex jones claims the deep state wants to
[03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:10.280]  nuke DC now that's that's another one there was another one from the from
[03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:13.480]  today on there that's just a whole separate deal you know I said in that
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:18.520]  article that they're gonna attack republicans go after them and they could
[03:21:18.520 --> 03:21:23.480]  even set a nuke off to take Congress out I mean there's no telling they don't
[03:21:23.480 --> 03:21:29.480]  want to give up there it is a truck kamikaze rammed it a cement truck a
[03:21:29.480 --> 03:21:34.600]  big truck a dump truck kamikaze rammed it and Paul Ryan was on board there's
[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:41.440]  one dead a bunch of people injured but what's the odds of this and then again I
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:47.200]  was going through hypotheticals and they take it out of context so that's how
[03:21:47.200 --> 03:21:51.160]  they operate all I know is it needs to be seriously investigated just like the
[03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:55.600]  you know the guy that showed up and shot everybody or you know they've had truck
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:59.360]  attacks all over and they won't say it's islamist is doing it it's like what
[03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:02.880]  happened in New York a few months ago and that day they're having congressional
[03:22:02.880 --> 03:22:08.200]  hearings and they go oh jones says that you know an imam warned of the attack
[03:22:08.200 --> 03:22:12.520]  and it was Islamic attack that's fake news don't worry we censored it it was an
[03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:18.720]  Islamic attack it was it was it was but that's what they do then they'll run
[03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:23.320]  around and say jones says it was the poor people doing the truck that did it
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:29.680]  no I said the different scenarios of what could go on from a heart attack to a
[03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:33.920]  stalled deal to them killing somebody and putting them in the truck to remote
[03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:40.280]  control to just our countries falling apart infrastructure wise okay let's go
[03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:44.320]  back to the calls here brandon in Arizona you're on the air what did you
[03:22:44.320 --> 03:22:49.920]  think of the state of the Union hey Alex can you hear me yes sir it was magic I
[03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:54.480]  mean my wife and I watched the whole thing he was straight shooting on every
[03:22:54.480 --> 03:22:58.360]  point we absolutely loved how he would look in turn to the Democrats and wave
[03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:02.600]  his hands up in the air like are you gonna stand are you gonna stand are you
[03:23:02.600 --> 03:23:07.360]  guys gonna finally stand but it's very impressed and the reason why I was
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:12.040]  calling in was one of the things that he said about how all the manufacturing
[03:23:12.040 --> 03:23:15.480]  companies are coming back especially the automobiles that he's got coming back
[03:23:15.480 --> 03:23:18.920]  in into the state do you think that there's any fear I've called in before
[03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:22.760]  kind of talking about the way most self-driving cars out here in Arizona do
[03:23:22.760 --> 03:23:26.920]  you have any fear that you know those cars will then just be made by robots and
[03:23:26.920 --> 03:23:31.800]  we won't even have an opportunity for jobs well that's the plan one of the
[03:23:31.800 --> 03:23:36.840]  last decent jobs a really hard-working folks is truck drivers and they need to
[03:23:36.840 --> 03:23:40.200]  know when to be there when to wait how to take care of the truck humans are
[03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:43.720]  amazing we built this world they're trying to force everything on the
[03:23:43.720 --> 03:23:47.440]  automation that's their admitted plan they want to raise insurance rates on
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:51.840]  human drivers when we've had disasters with these self-driving cars and
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:56.360]  absolutely I don't like all the incentive incentivization we see for
[03:23:56.360 --> 03:23:59.720]  self-driving cars being forced down people's throats and what I like about
[03:23:59.720 --> 03:24:04.720]  what Trump's doing is he's trying to say we're building a world for humans that's
[03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:09.440]  built by humans and so yes the future is still human you know it's a term I've
[03:24:09.440 --> 03:24:15.120]  used to make the future human but we need a human future and so that's the
[03:24:15.120 --> 03:24:18.720]  bottom line what do you think no I completely agree with you there was
[03:24:18.720 --> 03:24:21.440]  just the part where he was saying that that they're fearful because like I
[03:24:21.440 --> 03:24:25.320]  said in the past couple years out here in Arizona it's just you know what one
[03:24:25.320 --> 03:24:29.160]  car you see every two miles and four way most driving then you know six of them
[03:24:29.160 --> 03:24:33.000]  now I imagine you constantly everywhere everywhere and and David Knight was
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:36.120]  actually mentioned this morning that you know these automobile companies they
[03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:39.000]  don't look at themselves as an automobile company anymore they look at
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:43.880]  themselves as a tech company you know what I mean so I just the fearful
[03:24:43.880 --> 03:24:46.400]  well that's right because then once you've got a bunch of self-driving cars
[03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:50.640]  you can have them tasked with stealing data transmitting data delivering things
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:55.640]  and so yes there's a major displacement of human commerce and again it's an
[03:24:55.640 --> 03:25:01.760]  example of lowering quality I appreciate your call McDonald's began to put signs
[03:25:01.760 --> 03:25:05.200]  up in the 70s saying thank you as if you're supposed to throw it away then
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:09.800]  you get a dirty place low quality then there's nobody there to clean things up
[03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:15.920]  then they got away from full-service gas stations where they check your oil
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:21.000]  check things proven it's better for the vehicle you name it they got rid of that
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:25.760]  but then you see it the other way like oh kill people that's that'll solve
[03:25:25.760 --> 03:25:29.960]  healthcare no build-up economies have more quality more services that's make
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:33.920]  things better for humans that makes the ecosystem economically more complex in a
[03:25:33.920 --> 03:25:40.160]  great example is Alamo draft house which is run by liberal globalist folks that
[03:25:40.160 --> 03:25:44.640]  hate my guts and all the rest of it and you know they've got to be too big of a
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:48.200]  chain so they've had some of their own issues and you know I call it a Alamo
[03:25:48.200 --> 03:25:51.560]  food poisoning house because I personally never get food poisoning I've had it
[03:25:51.560 --> 03:25:54.640]  there three times my kids have gotten up there I don't even go there anymore
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:58.120]  because you know I'm sorry it's where I get food poisoning but I'm not trying to
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:04.120]  attack their company they're putting in general you know gender neutral you know
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:09.560]  gender neutral place over here and in Southeast Austin where everybody goes in
[03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:13.080]  the same bathroom it's not like a bunch of small bathrooms which I like that are
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:16.520]  just anybody goes in but it's one person at a time that's great you know like like
[03:26:16.520 --> 03:26:20.320]  a W hotel there's like seven bathrooms that's wonderful you know I'm there by
[03:26:20.320 --> 03:26:24.320]  myself you know that's great it's the opposite they all heard you in to get
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:29.840]  rid of the gender so they're little social engineer people but they started
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:38.440]  the trend 15 16 17 years ago of the little boutique theaters where they had
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:43.920]  food and drinks and things they kind of expanded that rolled it out and now just
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:48.320]  because of them every other theater chain in Austin tore everything out went
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:53.280]  to lounge seats has food has drinks outside that they've they've all gone to
[03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:56.760]  it through competition so that's an example and then of course Alamo got
[03:26:56.760 --> 03:27:00.600]  too big and had problems and I don't know what's going on with them but I will
[03:27:00.600 --> 03:27:04.640]  not eat their food because they're so big and got issues that whatever's
[03:27:04.640 --> 03:27:07.640]  happening let me tell you something I can eat a dead horse okay and that place
[03:27:07.640 --> 03:27:11.360]  gives me it gives me food poisoning and I say that to be mean I just thought
[03:27:11.360 --> 03:27:15.240]  about it they it's happening me I can't go there because of it so I'm gonna talk
[03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:17.680]  about it now it's something that's happening to me and my family we can't
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:21.440]  go there but anyways everybody else has converted to it so great they were
[03:27:21.440 --> 03:27:27.360]  trailblazers that's an example of growing too fast though being Obama bots and
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:32.000]  that's where they are but that changed everything so now they got all these
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:36.640]  movie theaters I walk in there like swanky clubs with marble counters and all
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:42.080]  this great food like I pick great folks up there in north Austin foods amazing
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:46.080]  never had an issue I was just telling you and they got a couple Alamos are
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:49.040]  close to me I'd rather go to them that you know they got funny movies and
[03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:53.280]  clips and that's a nice theater just I had to be honest I've gotten a point
[03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:56.560]  where I just got to be honest with you and I'm gonna tell it like it is now
[03:27:56.560 --> 03:27:59.280]  so there's some other Alamo franchises around the country may be great the
[03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:02.480]  ones that are still owned by the people that started it right here in Austin
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:07.440]  Texas I won't go to plus some other issues that went on there and I'll leave
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:14.200]  it at that so mm-hmm something else you want to have your food served to you by
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:18.680]  an SJW that's where you go so we're gonna go to break them back with your
[03:28:18.680 --> 03:28:22.640]  calls I'm gonna play what I think is the most important clip Trump put out and
[03:28:22.640 --> 03:28:27.560]  that is we will return America to the people that is so simple but so
[03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:32.960]  fundamental and so earth-shaking to these globalist that it's amazing so we're

[03:33:15.280 --> 03:33:22.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny
[03:33:22.120 --> 03:33:29.520]  well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones we're
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:32.200]  going back to your phone calls here in just a minute amazing points the
[03:33:32.200 --> 03:33:36.160]  callers are making I didn't mean to go off on a jag about the local movie
[03:33:36.160 --> 03:33:39.880]  theater chain that changed the whole theater system nationwide I think that
[03:33:39.880 --> 03:33:45.440]  contribution is amazing but the Alamo draft house started feeding people and
[03:33:45.440 --> 03:33:48.360]  alcohol and it was already starting to pop off some other chains but they've
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:51.880]  gone nationwide like nobody else and now everybody else is pulling out the old
[03:33:51.880 --> 03:33:56.200]  stadium seating and going with quality and the tickets cost like 50 cents more
[03:33:56.200 --> 03:34:02.160]  and again it's what you demand quality wise and it's the same thing I can play
[03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:06.400]  the clips for Bill Gates goes if we get rid of one grandma and don't give her
[03:34:06.400 --> 03:34:11.360]  that care the last year we can hire 10 teachers and what he's saying is get rid
[03:34:11.360 --> 03:34:14.720]  of your life force get rid of your standing up for each other get rid of
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:19.640]  any of your standards you can get money if you help us engage in eugenics and
[03:34:19.640 --> 03:34:23.440]  extermination and that isn't right to die that isn't man believe me I've had a
[03:34:23.440 --> 03:34:27.400]  family die I've I've seen it all I'm brain dead I don't want to be kept alive
[03:34:27.400 --> 03:34:32.960]  that's totally separate they mix right to die with the state euthanizing you
[03:34:32.960 --> 03:34:38.720]  and that's their plan and that's what they're pushing now Bezos and the
[03:34:38.720 --> 03:34:42.760]  Bill and the Gates Foundation that's why Buffett's involved and Jamie Dimon
[03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:50.720]  they're gonna save you instead demand more quality take care of more people
[03:34:50.720 --> 03:34:59.200]  and then that's the civilization you build is medicine and luxury and travel
[03:34:59.200 --> 03:35:03.160]  that no one could ever have now almost anybody can have and the globalists are
[03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:07.680]  the ones saying oh that's bad for the earth austerity we're gonna fly with a
[03:35:07.680 --> 03:35:13.440]  plain load of male and female hookers to Davos but you can't have heating in
[03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:22.440]  your house this is bad for the earth I mean these are selfish people period and
[03:35:22.440 --> 03:35:27.200]  they treat your employees like dirt especially Bezos I mean Bezos is the
[03:35:27.200 --> 03:35:34.800]  worst of a crowd of bad guys man super bad news super bad news but he
[03:35:34.800 --> 03:35:39.640]  verges his signals all day see while he supports TPP in the IMF the World Bank
[03:35:39.640 --> 03:35:44.280]  and has Chinese slave good deals and treats his employees the worst ever and
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:48.120]  it's slave conditions but it's okay because his eyes point different
[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:55.000]  directions she's a fly when it goes like this and he's trending he funds
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:59.200]  black lives matter so it's cool yeah Bill Gates his dad admitted that we need
[03:35:59.200 --> 03:36:02.800]  to sterilize the black people and yeah he headed up Planned Parenthood and yeah
[03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:05.480]  Bill Gates agreed and a Bill Moyers interview that we need to get rid of
[03:36:05.480 --> 03:36:10.720]  the poor people and sterilize them and yeah on and on and on and yeah he funds
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:14.440]  Cold Spring Harbor which is where they created the whole Nazi eugenics
[03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:19.840]  operation and yeah his family was involved in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:33.280]  that's okay you know because he's real liberal that's sick and that's the thing
[03:36:33.280 --> 03:36:38.200]  they're the ones brainwashing all the immigrants to hate everybody to bring
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:42.000]  everybody down so a big horde of brainwash immigrants are dangerous and
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:46.440]  are racist and are bad many cases but it doesn't mean you play into the whole
[03:36:46.440 --> 03:36:50.440]  paradigm because that's how these guys win you've got to learn their scams
[03:36:50.440 --> 03:36:54.960]  it's the only way to stop them and once you've got the scam down it's over for
[03:36:54.960 --> 03:37:02.360]  these guys man they're uncool and it's the only black person they let the
[03:37:02.360 --> 03:37:10.120]  meetings is Oprah Winfrey that tell you about these guys what a witch when she's
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:14.280]  not delivering young women to Harvey Weinstein okay let's go to the most
[03:37:14.280 --> 03:37:18.440]  powerful clip because it's simple you're like well of course but that's what's
[03:37:18.440 --> 03:37:24.120]  revolutionary family church community workers being strong honoring people
[03:37:24.120 --> 03:37:31.040]  working hard having that attitude no no stop don't do it no no no not that but
[03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:34.600]  the big do you disagree I'm gonna ask the callers this we should ask this in
[03:37:34.600 --> 03:37:39.880]  the war room coming up what is the most important thing Trump said and what do
[03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:43.800]  you disagree with and I'm not trying to prime you disagree with the president I
[03:37:43.800 --> 03:37:46.880]  just I'm saying you're welcome I'd like to hear that because I'm gonna tell you I
[03:37:46.880 --> 03:37:50.680]  disagree with the president right now you know what remind me to do it next
[03:37:50.680 --> 03:37:55.200]  segment because I'll forget I'm gonna tell you the big thing Trump's doing
[03:37:55.200 --> 03:37:58.600]  wrong that is gonna end up being his undoing and I know he's smart he's got a
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:02.520]  good spirit he means well and maybe I'm wrong but I just at a gut level know
[03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:06.960]  there's one thing he's doing particularly that is gonna lead to rack and ruin
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:11.360]  potentially so here is the president saying what I believe was the most
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:16.840]  integral key thing he said it's so true it's so simple and it's so essential to
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:21.040]  tell you you're in charge you're important you control the destiny you are
[03:38:21.040 --> 03:38:26.920]  your own person he's activating that in a ritual all these satanic rituals
[03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:29.960]  they're trying to do bad stuff and like putting it into a ritual but the ritual
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:34.800]  of standing up and saying God country family you have value we're gonna build
[03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:38.960]  we're strong we're gonna celebrate what we've done we're gonna come together you
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:44.800]  are gonna take control of your destiny you're gonna wake up see I don't do all
[03:38:44.800 --> 03:38:49.720]  the NLP and all the linguistics and all the programming but I innately already
[03:38:49.720 --> 03:38:56.520]  do it because all of that is copying truth copying reality trying to create
[03:38:56.520 --> 03:39:02.520]  a synthetic system of lies what you deliver it where people will buy it
[03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:08.800]  because it's packages truth I innately as a natural and all of your natural's
[03:39:08.800 --> 03:39:18.480]  if you simply stop trying to be fake I never won a fight that I tried to win I
[03:39:18.480 --> 03:39:24.480]  won the fights where I didn't think about it and then every punch devastation a
[03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:29.360]  few fights where I had to think it out got my ass kicked whenever I turn loose
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:35.680]  and just let my body do it need to be done ended very quickly and it's the
[03:39:35.680 --> 03:39:39.040]  same thing Trump keeps saying the deepest thing I ever did was learning to
[03:39:39.040 --> 03:39:45.080]  become shallow that is so zen and the media made fun of that because they
[03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:54.400]  didn't even get it you think women's intuition is shallow because they'll
[03:39:54.400 --> 03:39:58.720]  tell you women go off their intuition even more but the whole system is
[03:39:58.720 --> 03:40:02.680]  telling them don't go with your gut and everything the species gave you to make
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:09.160]  the right decisions don't go with that innate power don't don't go with that
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:17.800]  all right let's go to the president here it is some host story is a testament to
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:24.280]  the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom it was that same yearning for
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:32.560]  freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America
[03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:38.760]  it was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:48.560]  wilderness it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea that
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:57.320]  they could rule themselves that they could chart their own destiny and that
[03:40:57.320 --> 03:41:05.240]  together they could light up the entire world that is what our country has
[03:41:05.240 --> 03:41:11.440]  always been about that is what Americans have always stood for always strived
[03:41:11.440 --> 03:41:22.280]  for and always done atop the dome of this capital stands the Statue of Freedom
[03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:30.200]  he stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought
[03:41:30.200 --> 03:41:36.400]  and lived and died to protect her monuments to Washington and Jefferson
[03:41:36.400 --> 03:41:46.760]  and Lincoln and King memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga the
[03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:53.360]  young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:42:02.840]  beyond and others who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all
[03:42:02.840 --> 03:42:13.720]  over Asia and freedom stands tall over one more monument than this one this
[03:42:13.720 --> 03:42:22.440]  capital this living monument this is the monument to the American people
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:28.120]  it's about America not about the bubbles the dims oh it might start standing

[03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:14.960]  Trump clip I was talking about Trump reminds lawmakers you serve America first
[03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:17.440]  here it is
[03:48:18.360 --> 03:48:25.440]  we're a people whose heroes live not only in the past but all around us
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:34.080]  defending hope pride and defending the American way they work in every trade
[03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:41.880]  they sacrifice to raise a family they care for our children at home they
[03:48:41.880 --> 03:48:49.320]  defend our flag abroad and they are strong moms and brave kids they are
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:55.640]  firefighters and police officers and border agents medics and Marines but
[03:48:55.640 --> 03:49:02.600]  above all else they are Americans and this capital this city this nation
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:10.640]  belongs entirely to them exactly what I keep saying if you're an American it's
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:16.560]  your country there's a standing ovation for that yeah crank it back up that's
[03:49:16.560 --> 03:49:21.560]  it if you want free market the wealth it's yours it's all a big lie by the big
[03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:24.440]  foundations and globalists and if you're not white you don't get to be part of
[03:49:24.440 --> 03:49:31.240]  the country it's pure crap our task is to respect them to listen to them to
[03:49:31.240 --> 03:49:40.960]  serve them to protect them and to always be worthy of them Americans fill the
[03:49:40.960 --> 03:49:50.120]  world with art and music they push the bounds of science and discovery and they
[03:49:50.120 --> 03:50:00.240]  forever remind us of what we should never ever forget the people dreamed this
[03:50:00.240 --> 03:50:08.720]  country the people built this country and it's the people who are making America
[03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:15.440]  great again all right that's good let's stop right there we gotta check his
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:20.480]  speech and do promos for months I mean it's just all coffin nails to vampires
[03:50:20.480 --> 03:50:27.280]  high noon to vampires justice to pedophiles if you got a business you
[03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:31.640]  didn't build that somebody else did that for you well the chicken of the egg
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:36.280]  Obama where'd that come from when you're paying the taxes and dealing with
[03:50:36.280 --> 03:50:40.120]  everything and all the rest of it and run in your office when you're sick
[03:50:40.120 --> 03:50:45.240]  because there's only two or three of you biggest small business startups in US
[03:50:45.240 --> 03:50:48.760]  history since we've been recording statistics it's all coming back and
[03:50:48.760 --> 03:50:53.040]  they're so pissed and notice what mama said he got a business you didn't build
[03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:57.520]  that somebody else did that for you what he just say can you back that up 30
[03:50:57.520 --> 03:51:02.360]  seconds you said you built America you are America you did it you built it
[03:51:02.360 --> 03:51:10.400]  unifying you it's all about individual woes with a shared dream building a
[03:51:10.400 --> 03:51:15.480]  collective not the Soviet Central Bureau collectivizes you and tells what to do
[03:51:15.480 --> 03:51:20.520]  no you just build it and then you see what is good and what works and then you
[03:51:20.520 --> 03:51:24.440]  all join together and then that builds it
[03:51:27.200 --> 03:51:31.480]  but people like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton they want to run it so
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:38.120]  bad and they just get violently angry at your health or your beauty or your
[03:51:38.120 --> 03:51:41.800]  strength or your will and they think you're stupid because you're not like
[03:51:41.800 --> 03:51:46.320]  them always scheming how to screw somebody over and my biggest wake-up in
[03:51:46.320 --> 03:51:52.480]  my life is I thought evil like that was only in certain places I didn't realize
[03:51:52.480 --> 03:51:57.400]  that it's been mass produced and there are a lot of losers out there who weren't
[03:51:57.400 --> 03:52:03.640]  successful through the normal systems so they decided to be bad people now
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:08.560]  before I go back to your calls here let me tell you the problem with Trump and
[03:52:08.560 --> 03:52:12.520]  what wasn't really brought up in a speech Russia has been taken over by the
[03:52:12.520 --> 03:52:16.520]  globalist for 70 80 years they've halfway got control of their country again
[03:52:16.520 --> 03:52:21.800]  they're not expanding they help us at 9-11 they help us with ISIS all they
[03:52:21.800 --> 03:52:26.680]  did most of the work on the last four years our military recognized that
[03:52:26.680 --> 03:52:30.440]  it works with them and they're Christian and conservative and patriotic and
[03:52:30.440 --> 03:52:34.760]  pro-human and have programs paying people to have kids and they're trying to live
[03:52:34.760 --> 03:52:37.960]  that they're not a culture of death they've been under that for a long time
[03:52:37.960 --> 03:52:40.760]  they kind of hit bottom so they're they're coming back up kind of like we
[03:52:40.760 --> 03:52:46.080]  are starting to come back up and Trump is massing troops on the Russian border
[03:52:46.080 --> 03:52:49.760]  they've double what NATO had there you got the Marine Corps commandant saying
[03:52:49.760 --> 03:52:53.560]  get ready for war with Russia you got all these missiles being moved up in a
[03:52:53.560 --> 03:52:59.560]  new Cold War kicking off and all this and it's Trump trying to look tough on
[03:52:59.560 --> 03:53:04.080]  Russia instead of his instinct to have daytime and then to get in there all
[03:53:04.080 --> 03:53:07.760]  those Russian resources is more than Africa good Lord that's and Russia's
[03:53:07.760 --> 03:53:13.040]  ready they want the investment but Western elites don't want Russia to share
[03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:17.200]  in the empowerment they picked China and its corrupt system because it would
[03:53:17.200 --> 03:53:21.040]  have one child policies and it would execute Buddhist and Christians and it
[03:53:21.040 --> 03:53:24.160]  would be ruthless and evil so Rockefeller and others said we're going to be with
[03:53:24.160 --> 03:53:28.360]  you and went in there when China couldn't even produce toilet paper for half
[03:53:28.360 --> 03:53:33.360]  their population to wipe their ass okay 30 years ago and built it up to a bigger
[03:53:33.360 --> 03:53:36.760]  economy than us and gave them all our secrets and now they're breathing down
[03:53:36.760 --> 03:53:43.520]  our necks man so if Russia gets in our way or tried to do something I'm not a
[03:53:43.520 --> 03:53:51.600]  roosa file but it's Russia has been under the same thumb as us it's natural
[03:53:51.600 --> 03:53:55.640]  China doesn't have any resources except for the people it uses like slaves
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:54:04.000]  Russia's 90% untapped it's a very simple economic human equation for the
[03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:08.840]  United States with all its fury and energy and and wildness and then all of
[03:54:08.840 --> 03:54:13.400]  Russia's scientific and cultural acumen and resources to work with Russia
[03:54:13.400 --> 03:54:17.080]  and it has been the fear of the globalist from the beginning that
[03:54:17.080 --> 03:54:20.000]  something like that would happen but everybody's pulling out of the new
[03:54:20.000 --> 03:54:24.520]  world order and Russia helped lead the charge on that and that's the only
[03:54:24.520 --> 03:54:29.600]  Russian collusion there is and Trump has been pushed by his generals and all
[03:54:29.600 --> 03:54:33.640]  these other people into the Russians are ruthless they're cunning they're only
[03:54:33.640 --> 03:54:37.400]  looking for an advantage don't be a fool and show everybody you're tough and
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:42.560]  it's it's it's a it's a it's a mess he now lists the so-called oligarchs
[03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:46.120]  anybody that's got money in Russia and talk about going after hundreds of
[03:54:46.120 --> 03:54:50.880]  Russian businessman and shutting them off which is a real act of war and all
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:56.800]  Putin said was that's not very friendly not oh you better watch it that's an
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:55:04.480]  act of war all that's not very friendly come on you know Russia doesn't teach
