[00:00.000 --> 00:22.900]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[00:22.900 --> 00:30.200]  show.
[00:30.200 --> 00:35.080]  The Bible says that as the end days approach, whether you believe in it or not, the Bible
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.960]  says time will speed up, people will run to and fro continually, there will be so much
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.840]  information no one will know what to do with it, like water, water, everywhere, not a drop
[00:45.840 --> 00:53.160]  to drink because despite all the information, the public on average will get dumber and dumber.
[00:53.160 --> 00:57.000]  The aftermath of the Megyn Kelly interview, we're going to be going over that today, what
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.900]  it signifies in dinosaur media, the untold deceptions, the 19-minute piece, it just makes
[01:04.900 --> 01:09.080]  the head swim, there's so many lies.
[01:09.080 --> 01:15.160]  Then of course we've got the even bigger news here, ladies and gentlemen, US-led coalition
[01:15.160 --> 01:21.200]  of Syrian plane, active aggression and support of terrorists, that's from the Ministry of
[01:21.200 --> 01:28.640]  Defense and from their foreign affairs department, Russia to target US planes flying over Syria
[01:28.640 --> 01:33.280]  as targets and shoot them down.
[01:33.280 --> 01:41.760]  Russia warns US not to hit Syrian government troops in another report, Russia ends air
[01:41.760 --> 01:48.800]  safety agreement between US-led coalition for Syrian jet, shoot down.
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.480]  Now Trump has turned the US military loose to take out ISIS, but they've been massing
[01:53.480 --> 02:01.560]  artillery, marines, army, you name it, in and along on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border,
[02:01.560 --> 02:10.440]  we've seen people like the national security advisor, the president, also the chairman
[02:10.440 --> 02:16.480]  of the joint chiefs, as well as the secretary of defense, floating different ideas about
[02:16.480 --> 02:22.160]  taking out Assad and ISIS at the same time.
[02:22.160 --> 02:29.000]  So this is a very dangerous situation, McMasters appears to be at the center of it, I'm not
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.360]  trying to demonize him, it's just that's the news that keeps coming out from our sources
[02:33.360 --> 02:39.480]  and then as later confirmed in the news, I cannot stress to people enough how dangerous
[02:39.480 --> 02:46.360]  this is to have this confrontation with Russia on Russia's doorstep in a sovereign country
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.120]  where Russia was invited in, where our government, starting six years ago, via Hillary at the
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.600]  head of the State Department and Obama, launching strikes into the country with paramilitary
[02:57.600 --> 03:05.520]  forces to destabilize it, call the invasion of civil war, back ISIS, back al-Qaeda, back
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.600]  al-Nusra, trying to overthrow the country, our own military refused to go along with
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.840]  it, going back about four and a half years ago, so there's been a stalemate and now that
[03:15.840 --> 03:21.760]  Trump's in, he says, knock out ISIS, but then our military begins to knock out ISIS, but
[03:21.760 --> 03:28.000]  also prepares to basically take the rest of the country with these military moves and
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.480]  begins targeting and bombing Assad forces on the ground that are battling Wahhabi's forces.
[03:35.480 --> 03:46.480]  And now, shooting down a Syrian aircraft, this is a U.S.-Russia showdown and it's being
[03:46.480 --> 03:54.720]  done by the deep state, not President Trump, who made it clear that he is not going to
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.320]  have troops on the ground to take out Assad, and we told you that three days before he
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.520]  came out and said that word for word a few months ago from our White House sources, and
[04:04.520 --> 04:08.480]  Trump has been very, very clear about this, that he doesn't like the fact that the civil
[04:08.480 --> 04:12.600]  war was started there by Obama, that he doesn't think the Syrian leadership is offensive or
[04:12.600 --> 04:17.800]  causing a problem, and that it's not our place to remove them, and that he wants to basically
[04:17.800 --> 04:24.440]  stabilize the Middle East and put Iran and Saudi Arabia in check.
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.160]  Remember Trump said no to troops in Syria, his aides aren't so sure.
[04:29.160 --> 04:34.080]  That was days after we broke that down, Bloomberg and others laid it out, the point is we have
[04:34.080 --> 04:43.000]  our sources and I've reached out to them, I haven't gotten contacted back yet because
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.160]  it takes time to get into position and be able to get the information, and I'll just
[04:47.160 --> 04:48.160]  leave it at that.
[04:48.160 --> 04:53.040]  But we have a bunch of big guests today, Jesse James is coming on, we have Mike Cernovich
[04:53.040 --> 04:58.840]  in the studio, Paul Joseph Watson, Joe Biggs is going to be in the studio, I'm Alex Joe
[04:58.840 --> 05:28.800]  and stay with us.
[05:28.800 --> 05:34.560]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat US aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.120]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation
[05:39.120 --> 05:43.160]  to be over, but don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.160]  overnight.
[05:44.160 --> 05:47.600]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia while they are threatening
[05:47.600 --> 05:49.440]  him and our country.
[05:49.440 --> 05:53.680]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria
[05:53.680 --> 05:56.640]  in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[05:56.640 --> 06:02.400]  Don't fall for it, make America great again, for ImpeWars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[06:02.400 --> 06:07.560]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry, our ancestors would hear the
[06:07.560 --> 06:14.000]  drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[06:14.000 --> 06:20.120]  Sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[06:20.120 --> 06:25.680]  of their own, air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there were silent weapons for
[06:25.680 --> 06:31.400]  quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, the lining of plastics that destroy
[06:31.400 --> 06:36.640]  our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[06:36.640 --> 06:39.720]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.

[07:58.480 --> 08:19.240]  Take action now before we sell out.
[08:19.240 --> 08:48.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are viewing the
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.680]  collapse of mainstream media, not just here but around the world.
[08:53.680 --> 08:59.840]  We are witnessing the panicking cultural left backed by the big multinational combines openly
[08:59.840 --> 09:05.640]  trying to declare physical and cultural war against anyone that doesn't submit to them
[09:05.640 --> 09:09.440]  and we have the big news.
[09:09.440 --> 09:16.480]  Last night, the US military reportedly shot down a Syrian military aircraft in its own
[09:16.480 --> 09:24.800]  airspace for reportedly flying too close to US forces, about a month ago they blew up
[09:24.800 --> 09:30.720]  a convoy that was going into a town controlled by ISIS so military convoy of armored vehicles
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.160]  and tanks was bombed by the US military and Russia is saying this is basically an act
[09:36.160 --> 09:41.400]  of war, they have warned the US that the downing of Syrian warplanes say if any US aircraft
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.720]  enter the airspace now they're going to shoot it down so that is what you call a new Cuban
[09:46.720 --> 10:02.120]  missile crisis, that is what you call people, that is what you call the people of the planet
[10:02.120 --> 10:12.480]  having a very, very serious problem on their hands as the deep state inside of our government
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.560]  attempts to manipulate our country into war.
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.640]  President Trump is on record, President Trump is clear, President Trump does what he says
[10:20.640 --> 10:27.400]  you'll do or he basically dies trying and he said I want to knock out ISIS, kick him
[10:27.400 --> 10:32.200]  out of Iraq, kick him out of Syria, they were Obama's problem, he helped create him with
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.240]  Hillary, now I'm the president, it's my problem and every time McMaster's or every time somebody
[10:36.240 --> 10:40.040]  else comes out and says we're going to take out Assad too, Trump comes out and says no
[10:40.040 --> 10:44.640]  you're not, our troops are there to remove ISIS and stabilize the country, we're not
[10:44.640 --> 10:48.920]  removing Assad, they're going to have elections, we already have an agreement.
[10:48.920 --> 10:56.680]  So clearly this is being done to stir things up, this is being done to try to push our
[10:56.680 --> 11:02.880]  country into war and this is the biggest threat yet to the Trump presidency, to our recovery
[11:02.880 --> 11:05.480]  and to real world peace.
[11:05.480 --> 11:11.200]  Our government with Saudi Arabia and others turned loose, jihadi, Wahhabist fighters in
[11:11.200 --> 11:17.720]  more than 15 countries in the last nine years under Obama.
[11:17.720 --> 11:21.000]  Trump is now trying to reverse that.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.840]  The Arab Spring was run by the criminal elements of the CIA and by Google and by Facebook and
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.760]  by all the usual suspects and by CNN promoting it, that's why we say CNN is ISIS and more
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.360]  folks took the stage in New York last night at Shakespeare in the park where they simulated
[11:35.360 --> 11:40.040]  murdering the president and said CNN is ISIS, stop pushing the culture of violence, stop
[11:40.040 --> 11:51.560]  pushing death, stop doing it and so all over this is beginning to happen more and more.
[11:51.560 --> 12:01.440]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we have to ask ourselves what are we going to do as
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.040]  a people to wake up to the fact that we're being manipulated and how are we going to
[12:05.040 --> 12:10.000]  reach out to the massive folks upwards of a third of the population in the United States
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.480]  even higher in Europe that's still in a trance but still believes mainstream media is their
[12:15.480 --> 12:16.480]  friend.
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.440]  We're going to laugh at that 30-40% that don't know their heads from a hole in the ground
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.760]  and who can't find their rear end with both hands but those are our fellow humans.
[12:24.760 --> 12:29.440]  I don't care what color they are, where they came from, they can be woken up and we need
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.240]  to wake them up because they're being used as a lemming army of destabilization and
[12:34.240 --> 12:35.240]  danger.
[12:35.240 --> 12:40.720]  So we're going to cover the Russia situation, we're going to cover the push by leftists
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.320]  for violence that's even got Ted Nugent saying, listen, we need to de-escalate this on the
[12:45.320 --> 12:52.160]  right and the left, he's not saying that out of weakness, he's saying that out of understanding
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.840]  that these fools don't know how much danger they're in and we're trying to take the high
[12:56.840 --> 13:02.000]  road one more time before things get really really physical.
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.040]  So that's all coming up today.
[13:08.040 --> 13:15.960]  So Megan Kelly showed herself to be absolutely completely and totally deceptive.
[13:15.960 --> 13:20.920]  This is a thousand times bigger than Megan Kelly, a thousand times bigger than Alex Jones.
[13:20.920 --> 13:25.280]  This is a hundred times bigger than Donald Trump.
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.760]  This is about humanity and our destiny and our future and it's about MSM with its billions
[13:30.760 --> 13:37.760]  of dollars per station crafting lies and if you watch the 19 minute piece, it is one
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.000]  lie from pillar to post, from the start to the finish and that's why I can't just start
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  attacking it today because we're going to basically make a mini documentary with the
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  behind the scenes audio and video and we're going to show you lie after lie after lie
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.600]  systematically so you can see that this is the ultimate lie but bigger than that you
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.600]  can also see it's the ultimate failure from putting a heat lamp over my head to morphing
[14:02.600 --> 14:08.160]  my face and blowing it up big and lighting her perfectly to saying Trump's a liar.
[14:08.160 --> 14:09.160]  I'm a liar.
[14:09.160 --> 14:10.160]  Joe Biggs is a liar.
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.800]  No drugs come across the Mexico border.
[14:14.800 --> 14:15.800]  We're not journalists.
[14:15.800 --> 14:17.960]  That wasn't drugs in those containers.
[14:17.960 --> 14:19.800]  We talked to the FBI.
[14:19.800 --> 14:21.520]  We talked to the state police.
[14:21.520 --> 14:26.360]  We talked to the high level folks in ICE who told us where to go watch because they've
[14:26.360 --> 14:28.480]  been ordered to stand down.
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.840]  Joe was briefed by the FBI after this and he was briefed before the next mission and
[14:33.840 --> 14:39.000]  he went into Mexico where they have an al-Qaeda base, an ISIS base and it was later confirmed
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.080]  one year after that indeed that was an ISIS facility by judicial watch.
[14:45.080 --> 14:48.160]  So Joe Biggs our reporter goes in.
[14:48.160 --> 14:53.760]  We also first reported that in McAllen that the federal government was shipping people
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.560]  in and giving them money to be shipped by Greyhound and other bus wherever they wanted
[14:59.560 --> 15:04.760]  to go in the country to democratic facilities.
[15:04.760 --> 15:06.040]  And then later that all broke.
[15:06.040 --> 15:09.520]  You knew it as the quote migrant crisis, the children, the media spun up.
[15:09.520 --> 15:10.520]  They were children.
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.640]  17% were under the age of 18.
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.280]  It was whole families and we went into the centers.
[15:16.280 --> 15:17.440]  We went into the facilities.
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.840]  We went and we showed you.
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.440]  Shukari Jackson showed you, Adon Salazar showed you, Joe Biggs showed you, I showed you,
[15:24.440 --> 15:25.760]  John Bowne showed you.
[15:25.760 --> 15:33.360]  We all went to the border and we went in the terminals and we showed you all of it.
[15:33.360 --> 15:36.800]  We interviewed the local county emergency manager that said yes, we're ordered to load
[15:36.800 --> 15:37.800]  them in.
[15:37.800 --> 15:38.800]  They're not checked at the border.
[15:38.800 --> 15:39.800]  They come in.
[15:39.800 --> 15:43.960]  We put them on to the vehicle and we bring them in.
[15:43.960 --> 15:44.960]  No ID, no nothing.
[15:44.960 --> 15:51.240]  So, we show that and Megan Kelly says, look at the fake journalism.
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.080]  They claim these men swimming across the Rio Grande are bringing in drugs.
[15:55.080 --> 15:56.160]  We talked to law enforcement.
[15:56.160 --> 15:59.640]  They said those are 55 pound standard cartel bags.
[15:59.640 --> 16:00.640]  It's marijuana.
[16:00.640 --> 16:02.360]  It floats.
[16:02.360 --> 16:08.920]  The mules or the curriers then go back across and do it over and over and over again unless
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.080]  sometimes they're people that are illegal coming in and part of their passage across
[16:13.080 --> 16:16.960]  is that they've got to carry the bags, 55 pound packs.
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.200]  It's compacted marijuana.
[16:19.200 --> 16:21.600]  Its classic name is Mexican brown weed.
[16:21.600 --> 16:24.080]  It's known because it's dead.
[16:24.080 --> 16:25.080]  It's brown.
[16:25.080 --> 16:26.080]  It's been compacted.
[16:26.080 --> 16:30.320]  It's the classic marijuana that's always flooded Texas my whole life, even the worst headache
[16:30.320 --> 16:31.320]  you can imagine.
[16:31.320 --> 16:37.320]  But the point is that is the, you know, kind of the Budweiser of marijuana.
[16:37.320 --> 16:42.240]  It's the cheap or the Milwaukee's best and everybody knows it and that's what it is
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.960]  and it's being brought across and it's being loaded on right in front of you.
[16:47.960 --> 16:51.600]  I mean, we've got it coming across the Rio Grande with a camera.
[16:51.600 --> 16:54.960]  Then we're waiting when they come through the woods, the same people catch it on both
[16:54.960 --> 16:55.960]  sides.
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.640]  A perfect media sting.
[16:57.640 --> 16:59.200]  Where's our Peabody?
[16:59.200 --> 17:00.480]  Where's our Pulitzer?
[17:00.480 --> 17:03.080]  Where's our award for risking our lives?
[17:03.080 --> 17:04.600]  We don't get one.
[17:04.600 --> 17:13.120]  Megan Kelly, who'd never get close to that, says that it's fake.
[17:13.120 --> 17:16.280]  Yeah, they were just carrying their dirty laundry across her.
[17:16.280 --> 17:17.280]  I don't know.
[17:17.280 --> 17:18.280]  Maybe some food.
[17:18.280 --> 17:19.280]  No, it's drugs.
[17:19.280 --> 17:23.080]  And you'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to say it wasn't.
[17:23.080 --> 17:25.240]  But getting back to Megan Kelly, because it's bigger than her.
[17:25.240 --> 17:26.240]  It's about the fall.
[17:26.240 --> 17:28.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, I looked at her ratings with Putin.
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.040]  It was 7 million.
[17:32.040 --> 17:36.480]  Dateline NBC had up to 15 million viewers when I've been on it two or three times before.
[17:36.480 --> 17:37.640]  And it was never even a big deal.
[17:37.640 --> 17:39.400]  I mean, I'm on big shows all the time.
[17:39.400 --> 17:41.040]  This was hype.
[17:41.040 --> 17:46.560]  She has the record lowest ratings ever recorded for Dateline NBC because people are sick of
[17:46.560 --> 17:48.560]  it and they don't want hit pieces.
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.040]  And it was a total hit piece where she just acted like she interviewed me, waited until
[17:52.040 --> 17:56.120]  I paused, waited until I wiggled my chair over almost two hours, and then cut it together
[17:56.120 --> 17:57.680]  like I was a sweating buffoon.
[17:57.680 --> 18:02.200]  Well, people all know the reality.
[18:02.200 --> 18:06.060]  They see this gibbering, stammering person when I'm the opposite of that.
[18:06.060 --> 18:07.840]  People know they just saw fraud.
[18:07.840 --> 18:08.840]  But we've got it all.
[18:08.840 --> 18:09.840]  We've got the audio.
[18:09.840 --> 18:10.840]  We've got everything.
[18:10.840 --> 18:15.140]  But Mike Cernovich has pointed out to me, America's funniest home videos has higher
[18:15.140 --> 18:17.040]  ratings and reruns than this.
[18:17.040 --> 18:21.360]  Mike Cernovich will be on with us in studio coming up with Jesse James just a little while,
[18:21.360 --> 18:23.880]  but break this down for us.
[18:23.880 --> 18:25.040]  Exactly.
[18:25.040 --> 18:26.040]  She was humiliated.
[18:26.040 --> 18:27.600]  She counter-programmed her.
[18:27.600 --> 18:33.320]  So I don't know, should you do her a favor and release the tapes is my question because
[18:33.320 --> 18:37.440]  the way I'm thinking is nobody cares about her.
[18:37.440 --> 18:39.040]  Nobody cares about her.
[18:39.040 --> 18:41.360]  Do we want to promote her brand anymore?
[18:41.360 --> 18:43.000]  Because she's going to be out of the game.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  So I would say don't even release the audio.
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.160]  What's the point of releasing the audio when she's a failure and needs us to promote her
[18:50.160 --> 18:51.160]  brand?
[18:51.160 --> 18:52.960]  We would be doing her a huge favor.
[18:52.960 --> 18:54.880]  So I don't think we should release the audio.
[18:54.880 --> 18:57.240]  I want to be 100% clear here.
[18:57.240 --> 18:59.160]  In fact, let's pull that up.
[18:59.160 --> 19:01.840]  I'll give folks your source on that.
[19:01.840 --> 19:07.200]  Record low ratings, what, 3.0 million will show you the actual document here in a moment.
[19:07.200 --> 19:08.800]  This is joke level.
[19:08.800 --> 19:11.200]  We're not here saying we're on a power trip.
[19:11.200 --> 19:12.720]  We're not here saying we're big.
[19:12.720 --> 19:13.720]  We're powerful.
[19:13.720 --> 19:14.960]  It's not that we're that big.
[19:14.960 --> 19:15.960]  She's that little.
[19:15.960 --> 19:17.800]  There it is, Hollywood Reporter.
[19:17.800 --> 19:21.680]  The show offers up a flat 3.5 million viewers.
[19:21.680 --> 19:24.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is complete and total joke level.
[19:24.800 --> 19:29.320]  Sean Hannity every day has like 8 million viewers on his, or listeners on his radio
[19:29.320 --> 19:33.760]  show, 3 to 5 million on his nightly show.
[19:33.760 --> 19:37.280]  This broadcast has over 3 million a day conservatively.
[19:37.280 --> 19:40.440]  Rush Limbaugh has upwards of 10 million listeners a day.
[19:40.440 --> 19:45.280]  People like Coast to Coast AMs, George Norrie has 6 to 8 million listeners a day.
[19:45.280 --> 19:48.720]  I mean, talk radio is the biggest thing out there.
[19:48.720 --> 19:54.880]  What TV believes it's so elite and so powerful, we're only pointing out that 3.5 for her show
[19:54.880 --> 19:58.120]  when it was hyped like it was the end of the world is unbelievable.
[19:58.120 --> 20:00.840]  They hyped this like the Super Bowl for over two weeks.
[20:00.840 --> 20:02.600]  Let's expand on this.
[20:02.600 --> 20:09.600]  Mike Cernovich on his Facebook put out one video that was titled, let me go from memory
[20:09.600 --> 20:11.800]  here, Megan Kelly, the Queen of Fake News.
[20:11.800 --> 20:18.800]  I saw his internal analytics on his phone yesterday at my house where it had 4.5 million
[20:18.800 --> 20:23.400]  views, and then another version had 2 million views on somebody else's channel, and our
[20:23.400 --> 20:27.360]  channel copied it and had a million views, and then all my other videos together were
[20:27.360 --> 20:29.800]  over 15 million views.
[20:29.800 --> 20:35.080]  Just a few of the videos we put together, so with his views, that's 22 plus million
[20:35.080 --> 20:39.360]  views in the last week on videos we put out online.
[20:39.360 --> 20:43.080]  We get 22 mil, she gets 3.5 mil.
[20:43.080 --> 20:49.000]  Now, again, this shows how it is literally a giant fraud, a giant hoax, a giant paper
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  tiger, Mike Cernovich.
[20:50.000 --> 20:51.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[20:51.000 --> 20:52.960]  TV is a dead medium.
[20:52.960 --> 20:56.760]  It was a fun thing to kind of do, but she tried to use you for the ratings.
[20:56.760 --> 20:57.920]  It didn't work.
[20:57.920 --> 20:59.600]  People aren't interested in what they have to say.
[20:59.600 --> 21:03.560]  I mean, I actually got a funny comment from somebody who's a more liberal person, a liberal
[21:03.560 --> 21:09.320]  media critic, and he had said to me, he said, they brought on Tom Brokaw, whereas you have
[21:09.320 --> 21:13.520]  that on me and Andrew Torbott, the founder of a new social media company.
[21:13.520 --> 21:14.520]  We're the future.
[21:14.520 --> 21:15.520]  We're the truth.
[21:15.520 --> 21:17.080]  The best they can do is Megan Kelley.
[21:17.080 --> 21:21.520]  I didn't know what Tom Brokaw was, and then when I saw him, I thought it was Dan Rather.
[21:21.520 --> 21:22.520]  Who cares?
[21:22.520 --> 21:26.840]  They think they're going to lecture us, and then meanwhile, you have me, I'm out there
[21:26.840 --> 21:31.440]  breaking big news, Andrew Torbott's on there doing great things in social media.
[21:31.440 --> 21:32.440]  We're the future.
[21:32.440 --> 21:33.440]  They're the past.
[21:33.440 --> 21:34.440]  Everybody sees it now.
[21:34.440 --> 21:38.320]  Even the liberals who might disagree with us are saying Cernovich, you know, I'm trying
[21:38.320 --> 21:43.040]  to tell my friends that if you guys don't up your game, you're going to be crushed,
[21:43.040 --> 21:44.680]  and they're winning the game.
[21:44.680 --> 21:46.080]  That's what they're saying about us.
[21:46.080 --> 21:50.200]  Everybody now who understands is saying that we are winning and destroying the media game.
[21:50.200 --> 21:56.600]  And the left, even with their big pharma advertisers, the poison that they sell people, all the diseases
[21:56.600 --> 22:00.360]  that they make up that don't even exist, even with all that money behind them and saw us
[22:00.360 --> 22:05.640]  behind them, we have them on the run for the first time since probably 1950.
[22:05.640 --> 22:08.640]  Now tell you what's crazy.
[22:08.640 --> 22:09.640]  I'm not being mean to old people.
[22:09.640 --> 22:13.800]  I love old people that are patriots, but when you look at all the hosts except for Kelly,
[22:13.800 --> 22:17.160]  they all look like they were 80 years old, and they were all trying to act like they
[22:17.160 --> 22:23.000]  were cool hipsters, you know, oh, legalized marijuana, or oh, let's go to New Zealand,
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.480]  or let's go do this or that, and then they roll out Tom Brokaw, who called me a total
[22:27.480 --> 22:32.960]  unalloyed racist earlier in the week.
[22:32.960 --> 22:38.920]  And then they come back and he's at the end of the show to say, we must stand against
[22:38.920 --> 22:40.880]  this evil racist.
[22:40.880 --> 22:42.920]  You know, we've got to do all this.
[22:42.920 --> 22:44.360]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[22:44.360 --> 22:49.800]  They literally opened up like the crypt keepers mausoleum to bring out all their heavy hitters.
[22:49.800 --> 22:53.880]  And I realize that's because all the execs are super old at NBC.
[22:53.880 --> 22:58.040]  That's because the shareholders are, I see the parties they have with Megan Kelly on
[22:58.040 --> 23:04.880]  the runway, and it's a bunch of 75, 85, 90-year-old people with their trophy wife, 45-year-old
[23:04.880 --> 23:08.400]  women, and it's all these old men like Hugh Hefner's in these photos.
[23:08.400 --> 23:12.000]  You can Google their names, Dan Rather, Megan Kelly, and see them on the runway together
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.280]  and like all these little old men that are shorter than her, and that's no big deal.
[23:16.280 --> 23:17.520]  You get smaller as you get older.
[23:17.520 --> 23:21.920]  You know, my dad's like a foot shorter than he used to be, and I'm a few, it's just shorter
[23:21.920 --> 23:22.920]  than I used to be.
[23:22.920 --> 23:25.480]  You know, you slunch over, your, you know, your discs start collapsing, whatever.
[23:25.480 --> 23:30.480]  But there's like always little gremlin men like hanging on her, like she's their mommy,
[23:30.480 --> 23:36.000]  and they hope Medusa can roll out and defeat us, and then they have 3.5 million viewers
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.880]  according to Nielsen and Hollywood Reporter.
[23:39.880 --> 23:42.960]  This is the biggest joke I've ever seen.
[23:42.960 --> 23:47.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, my Sunday show is only half the size of my weekday broadcast.
[23:47.480 --> 23:49.280]  I'd like to get ahead of the news.
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.560]  It's got over 100 affiliates, conservatively, according to the ad agencies that get the
[23:53.560 --> 23:57.360]  big, you know, spectrum of ratings that come in.
[23:57.360 --> 24:01.680]  It has close to two million listeners on average that tune in.
[24:01.680 --> 24:04.840]  Sometimes if there's an NFL game or something, it's like, you know, not even a million.
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.640]  But that's on commercial radio rated, almost two million, the weekday show almost four
[24:09.640 --> 24:11.760]  million over the three, four hours.
[24:11.760 --> 24:12.760]  But that's rated.
[24:12.760 --> 24:16.280]  And then of course there's internet and live streams and everything else, it's huge.
[24:16.280 --> 24:20.960]  We're talking conservatively, 45 million different people that tune in each week, one way or
[24:20.960 --> 24:21.960]  the other.
[24:21.960 --> 24:27.680]  If that's 45 million people, it's not six million like Tom Brokaw, but notice Tom Brokaw
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.360]  on every other channel this week kept saying six million, six million, six million.
[24:31.360 --> 24:34.000]  There was no original article that even said that.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.760]  Some talking point went out and said the six million.
[24:36.760 --> 24:41.120]  I think it came from Podesta because the entire attack we're seeing from Pizza Gate to New
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.400]  Town to everything is the exact hit pieces they put out a year ago in the Hillary campaign
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.840]  against myself and Trump.
[24:47.840 --> 24:49.360]  It's word for word.
[24:49.360 --> 24:50.360]  What do you think?
[24:50.360 --> 24:56.200]  Yeah, it's old news and it's boring and all credit, of course, to you and the people who
[24:56.200 --> 24:57.520]  suck the air dry.
[24:57.520 --> 25:03.280]  So what happened is because we counter programmed so aggressively, everybody had already thought
[25:03.280 --> 25:04.800]  they watched the interview.
[25:04.800 --> 25:06.520]  Nobody cared to watch Megan Kelly.
[25:06.520 --> 25:10.240]  If you actually read the articles, all the articles talked about how we were drinking
[25:10.240 --> 25:13.920]  champagne and having fun and toasting to victory and everything.
[25:13.920 --> 25:16.440]  Nobody even cared about what Megan Kelly said.
[25:16.440 --> 25:18.280]  It goes to show she's not interesting.
[25:18.280 --> 25:19.280]  She doesn't read books.
[25:19.280 --> 25:22.860]  She said, ask Megan Kelly, what is the last book she has read?
[25:22.860 --> 25:24.160]  She clearly is not literate.
[25:24.160 --> 25:25.680]  She's not cultured.
[25:25.680 --> 25:27.760]  She didn't read a book about Russia before she went to Putin.
[25:27.760 --> 25:33.600]  I had actually heard from my sources in the media that she had made some very, she mistook
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.600]  St. Petersburg landmarks for things that were in Moscow.
[25:37.600 --> 25:40.920]  She completely humiliated herself.
[25:40.920 --> 25:47.400]  She got really excited when she talked about Putin to me and again, she doesn't get this.
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.560]  Even a toad like me with a heat lamp over my head, who'd been working since seven in
[25:52.560 --> 25:55.240]  the morning, interviewing me at 10 at night.
[25:55.240 --> 25:58.880]  And despite all the editing and almost two hours that she had just from that interview,
[25:58.880 --> 26:02.760]  all she could put out was the five or six stammers, the five or six times that I wiped
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.160]  my brow to make me look uneasy and all these jump cuts.
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.000]  And even CNN reporters came out and said, this adds credence to Jones because it's so edited.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.080]  And that's what Sean Hannity said.
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.280]  He said, listen, I'm not taking sides here, but he said this is totally edited.
[26:16.280 --> 26:18.600]  The American people deserve to see the full interview.
[26:18.600 --> 26:20.200]  I mean, this is a joke.
[26:20.200 --> 26:25.640]  Yeah, I was, I was embarrassed by the whole thing and it goes to show we should not waste
[26:25.640 --> 26:27.680]  our time talking to these people.
[26:27.680 --> 26:31.080]  They can't bring us any, they don't bring anything to the table NBC doesn't bring anything
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.080]  to the table.
[26:32.080 --> 26:37.160]  Well, but let's be clear, her show didn't overall, but the giant spectacle and the trolling
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.120]  them did because I realized when I bought that bottle of champagne at the grocery store
[26:41.120 --> 26:44.840]  yesterday with you before we came into the office, we were hanging out at my house.
[26:44.840 --> 26:49.840]  I knew that regardless just popping the champagne bottle and declaring victory would be victory
[26:49.840 --> 26:51.400]  because they don't get it.
[26:51.400 --> 26:53.440]  Mainstream media is already hated and reviled.
[26:53.440 --> 26:55.000]  They're already seen as the enemy.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.440]  So all we have to do is signify and identify with the public that hates them and celebrate
[27:00.440 --> 27:02.920]  their cultural powers death.
[27:02.920 --> 27:05.720]  That was the big win was simply the act of pissing on them.
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.400]  Well, and that's what I've been trying to tell all these weak beta males in the GOP
[27:09.400 --> 27:11.880]  who we have to route in 2018.
[27:11.880 --> 27:14.280]  The hit piece only lands if you flinch.
[27:14.280 --> 27:18.200]  When you laugh in their face and you mock them and you toast champagne, it doesn't even
[27:18.200 --> 27:19.200]  matter what's showing.
[27:19.200 --> 27:20.200]  Exactly.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.200]  If they throw a punch.
[27:21.200 --> 27:24.520]  Listen, that time, Glenn Danzig, who's a great musician, everything else, got in a fight
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.880]  with a guy a lot bigger than him and, you know, took it on the chin and got knocked
[27:28.880 --> 27:29.880]  out.
[27:29.880 --> 27:30.880]  That really hurt him.
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.000]  But if it wouldn't have knocked him out, it would have made him even stronger.
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.680]  Or if he had got back up and uppercutted the guy, then, you know, he'd be champion of
[27:37.680 --> 27:38.680]  the world.
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.680]  And I'm not trying to knock Glenn Danzig.
[27:39.680 --> 27:42.880]  You know, the point is his bodyguards jumped in and wouldn't let him keep fighting.
[27:42.880 --> 27:44.000]  Maybe he would have won.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.280]  The point is, is that if you take it on the chin and then it even knocks you down when
[27:48.280 --> 27:50.120]  you get back up, you're Superman.
[27:50.120 --> 27:51.560]  And that's why I went into it.
[27:51.560 --> 27:57.000]  Even a sweating blob up there with them lying and those snakes attacking me from every side,
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.760]  even though I'm not that strong, I'm not that good.
[27:59.760 --> 28:00.760]  My heart's good.
[28:00.760 --> 28:03.520]  I want freedom and I knew we would defeat them.
[28:03.520 --> 28:08.120]  And across the board, they admit we destroyed them and she had to lie on tape and promise
[28:08.120 --> 28:09.120]  it wasn't a hit piece.
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.320]  She's now known as a total liar, a total fraud.
[28:12.320 --> 28:14.440]  This is a devastating defeat for them.
[28:14.440 --> 28:15.440]  Yeah.
[28:15.440 --> 28:16.440]  Nobody interesting.
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.200]  He's going to talk to her now because we all heard her commit journalistic fraud.
[28:20.200 --> 28:22.320]  She is now a journalistic fraud.
[28:22.320 --> 28:26.040]  People who are interesting like me, why would ever talk to her now, especially for a few
[28:26.040 --> 28:27.200]  of Paltry viewers?
[28:27.200 --> 28:28.200]  I'll do more on that.
[28:28.200 --> 28:32.120]  Spend my time on Facebook and that's something the fake news people, media people have to
[28:32.120 --> 28:33.120]  understand.
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.240]  They get real angry because I blow them off and I go, look, dude, I can do a video or
[28:37.240 --> 28:38.840]  write a blog post.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.080]  More people are going to read it.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.080]  They're going to read your article.
[28:41.080 --> 28:42.600]  So don't waste my time.
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.320]  So the only media people I'll talk to now, they have to be literate and have read books.
[28:47.320 --> 28:51.120]  And that means it's only like 5% of journalism because the other people, they ask you the
[28:51.120 --> 28:56.200]  same questions over and over again, the same boring thing, Sandy Hook, Pizza Gate, this
[28:56.200 --> 28:57.200]  or that.
[28:57.200 --> 28:58.200]  And the public is burned out.
[28:58.200 --> 28:59.760]  You have to stay fresh.
[28:59.760 --> 29:03.920]  So the optics of it, I mean, you could, if you wanted to talk about a meme, you could
[29:03.920 --> 29:11.960]  compare you, me, Andrew Torba on one side, on the other side, Dan Rather or Tom Rather
[29:11.960 --> 29:16.520]  or whatever the guy's name is, and Megan Kelly on the other side.
[29:16.520 --> 29:20.760]  And then go show that to the people and say, what is the future and what is the past?
[29:20.760 --> 29:21.760]  Exactly.
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.400]  Or just show shots of younger people that are on YouTube, even than us, and like show
[29:26.400 --> 29:27.400]  their stats.
[29:27.400 --> 29:32.520]  They're like 20 times bigger and then say, now look at these people rolling out a retiree
[29:32.520 --> 29:34.160]  like Tom Brokaw.
[29:34.160 --> 29:39.360]  But again, if Tom Brokaw was promoting freedom, he would have giant audiences, no matter how
[29:39.360 --> 29:40.360]  old he was.
[29:40.360 --> 29:41.360]  So it's not bashing old people.
[29:41.360 --> 29:45.680]  It just shows, though, it is a bunch of old out of touch people that still think globalism
[29:45.680 --> 29:47.600]  is going to win when we've kicked their butt.
[29:47.600 --> 29:48.600]  Thanks Mike Cernovich.
[29:48.600 --> 29:50.520]  More coming up on the Russia crisis.
[29:50.520 --> 29:51.800]  We're on the march.
[29:51.800 --> 29:54.240]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.240 --> 30:01.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.480 --> 30:03.840]  While the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.120]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing
[30:08.120 --> 30:12.480]  of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President
[30:12.480 --> 30:13.480]  Trump.
[30:13.480 --> 30:17.480]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands,
[30:17.480 --> 30:22.240]  as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[30:22.240 --> 30:26.600]  While she was being arrested, Jack Pasobic went live on Twitter to broadcast the event
[30:26.600 --> 30:30.880]  and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that Joseph Goebbels
[30:30.880 --> 30:34.200]  would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis.
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.000]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.720]  Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[30:40.720 --> 30:45.360]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be
[30:45.360 --> 30:47.480]  proud, CNN is ISIS.
[30:47.480 --> 30:51.640]  While the protesters were all arrested, rumor has it some of the police involved support
[30:51.640 --> 30:55.800]  the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York
[30:55.800 --> 30:57.960]  Public Theater against our president.
[30:57.960 --> 31:01.040]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[31:28.120 --> 31:30.680]  To the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:30.680 --> 31:35.680]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:35.680 --> 31:38.680]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:38.680 --> 31:40.880]  The general public doesn't.
[31:40.880 --> 31:44.840]  The elects of pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:44.840 --> 31:48.440]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.440 --> 31:52.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.200]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.200 --> 31:59.400]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today in Infowars.com.
[32:25.200 --> 32:28.440]  All the refugees spreading disease around.
[32:28.440 --> 32:31.040]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:31.040 --> 32:32.040]  These are all parasites.
[32:32.040 --> 32:34.760]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[32:34.760 --> 32:36.000]  You have the neem in there.
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.080]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:39.080 --> 32:42.360]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:42.360 --> 32:43.360]  All right.
[32:43.360 --> 32:45.520]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[32:45.520 --> 32:46.720]  It just came back in yesterday.
[32:46.720 --> 32:47.720]  Living Defense.
[32:47.720 --> 32:48.720]  Infowars.com.
[32:48.720 --> 32:53.480]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support
[32:53.480 --> 32:54.480]  the broadcast.
[32:54.480 --> 32:55.480]  This is InfowarsLives.com.
[32:55.480 --> 32:57.480]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:57.480 --> 33:26.320]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:27.480 --> 33:56.320]  Thank you, Dr. Group, for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:56.320 --> 33:57.320]  Thank you.
[33:57.320 --> 34:01.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Sernovich is in studio with us.
[34:01.640 --> 34:03.640]  He was in the control room, but I thought just bring him in here.
[34:03.640 --> 34:06.680]  We've got a bunch of other guests coming on throughout the day.
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.200]  We've had one British man reportedly run over a Muslim and kill him in the street and hit
[34:12.200 --> 34:13.960]  a few other people.
[34:13.960 --> 34:15.160]  They're calling it a terror attack.
[34:15.160 --> 34:17.400]  The left is calling for total repribution.
[34:17.400 --> 34:20.720]  They're saying all whites are to blame, and all Christians are to blame.
[34:20.720 --> 34:21.800]  They're not calling for unity.
[34:21.800 --> 34:23.280]  They're not calling for love.
[34:23.280 --> 34:26.920]  They're not calling for hashtag, you know, sweetie pie.
[34:26.920 --> 34:27.920]  They're calling for death.
[34:27.920 --> 34:33.600]  We don't even know the truth about this or what the guy's political motives were yet.
[34:33.600 --> 34:37.800]  And they said that the man was already in the street and appeared to be sick with people
[34:37.800 --> 34:39.880]  gathered around him when he got run over.
[34:39.880 --> 34:45.680]  Now, we've seen staged events where they staged dead kids and stuff on the side of the Mediterranean.
[34:45.680 --> 34:48.920]  We know Islamists will blow themselves up for their political aims.
[34:48.920 --> 34:50.600]  So could this be staged?
[34:50.600 --> 34:51.920]  I'm not saying that.
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.000]  I'm saying our government staged the babies in the incubators event that led to millions
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.760]  of dead in multiple wars.
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.640]  I'm saying Muslims are, you know, caught staging stuff all the time.
[35:01.640 --> 35:04.600]  Trump said, you know, he thought the Jewish center is getting attacked and the cemetery
[35:04.600 --> 35:05.760]  was probably a false flag.
[35:05.760 --> 35:10.000]  And it turned out a month later, the police busted a young leftist Jewish man that was
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  doing it to blame Trump.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.440]  And a journalist actually, Juan M. Thompson, who, I mean, this is amazing.
[35:15.440 --> 35:17.840]  And again, that's why the fake news media is having a crisis.
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.880]  So legitimacy is Juan M. Thompson, who formerly worked at the Intercept, had written articles
[35:23.880 --> 35:27.960]  about how people at Trump rallies were calling the n-bomb and dropping n-bombs and everything
[35:27.960 --> 35:29.440]  like that.
[35:29.440 --> 35:34.200]  But then it turns out he was the person who was actually calling in death threats to Jewish
[35:34.200 --> 35:35.360]  community centers.
[35:35.360 --> 35:40.440]  And he was actually trying to frame a white woman that he had dated or been involved with
[35:40.440 --> 35:41.740]  for this crime.
[35:41.740 --> 35:45.440]  So we literally have so-called journalists, right?
[35:45.440 --> 35:48.480]  Calling in bomb threats, trying to frame other people.
[35:48.480 --> 35:49.560]  And then they go, well, wait a minute.
[35:49.560 --> 35:50.560]  Why does nobody trust this?
[35:50.560 --> 35:51.560]  Why do people fight against this?
[35:51.560 --> 35:56.360]  By the way, he was a journalist, a leftist, all the stuff, threats on the ADL.
[35:56.360 --> 35:59.840]  I'm not saying the ADL did this, but they've been caught breaking into police stations
[35:59.840 --> 36:01.040]  to get files.
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.460]  They've been caught and they've lost lawsuits, framing people, calling them anti-Semitic.
[36:05.460 --> 36:06.460]  They were founded.
[36:06.460 --> 36:08.120]  The ADL was founded by the Jewish mafia.
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.920]  Now, I don't believe Jews around the world, I'm not anti-Semitic.
[36:10.920 --> 36:18.560]  The ADL itself, though, is a leftist organization that has been caught and been absolutely convicted
[36:18.560 --> 36:22.160]  in civil court of engaging these type activities.
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.640]  And so we should investigate this particular operative and see if he had connections to
[36:26.640 --> 36:27.640]  the ADL.
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.640]  Well, a lot of my Jewish friends actually hate the ADL and we'll talk about these issues
[36:31.640 --> 36:37.080]  all the time because they know that there's a lot of people trying to divide people along
[36:37.080 --> 36:38.080]  racial lines.
[36:38.080 --> 36:39.080]  Religious.
[36:39.080 --> 36:43.560]  Now, one thing you'll notice is Alex began receiving death threats last night from Megan
[36:43.560 --> 36:46.200]  Kelly and that, I believe, was a target.
[36:46.200 --> 36:52.160]  She was trying to put a target on Alex and unlike Alex and I, we have pledged to disavow
[36:52.160 --> 36:53.240]  all political violence.
[36:53.240 --> 36:57.080]  So if this thing that happened with the guy in the van running over the mosque, I had
[36:57.080 --> 36:59.240]  people going, oh, I bet you won't comment about this.
[36:59.240 --> 37:04.880]  And I go, you're such a sociopath that you think that I would ever, ever have the back
[37:04.880 --> 37:05.880]  of the victim.
[37:05.880 --> 37:07.840]  No, I think if he did this just because they were Muslims, it's wrong.
[37:07.840 --> 37:08.840]  It's terrorism.
[37:08.840 --> 37:12.800]  And it's only going to ask like this, I totally agree that this is the time to intensify our
[37:12.800 --> 37:17.440]  calls to never offensively launch violence, I agree with Ted Nugent and we need to get
[37:17.440 --> 37:18.440]  back on the broadcast.
[37:18.440 --> 37:23.320]  Uncle Ted, that we need to have unity as much as possible as the left tries to start a civil
[37:23.320 --> 37:24.320]  war.
[37:24.320 --> 37:27.920]  And we're saying that again, so we have the moral high ground, but invite them to stop
[37:27.920 --> 37:28.920]  what they're doing.
[37:28.920 --> 37:31.840]  A lot of leftists, you know, to say, oh, yeah, we're about to bring it.
[37:31.840 --> 37:32.840]  We're about to shoot you.
[37:32.840 --> 37:34.120]  We're about to kill everybody.
[37:34.120 --> 37:35.400]  We're about to get Trump.
[37:35.400 --> 37:40.960]  They take our wanting to have peace, our wanting to have the high road.
[37:40.960 --> 37:43.240]  They take our kindness for weakness.
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.800]  And it seems like our calls for peace, though, are only getting them into a more violent
[37:47.800 --> 37:48.800]  froth everywhere.
[37:48.800 --> 37:52.440]  Well, they better hope, well, they found out that we'll protest.
[37:52.440 --> 37:53.440]  Okay.
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.320]  So they found out that if you want to have a little play where you assassinate Trump,
[37:57.320 --> 38:00.480]  the new right does protest, so my advice to them would be to ratchet down.
[38:00.480 --> 38:05.720]  But the bigger issue here is why will Jake Taper and Megan Kelly and Brian Svelter and
[38:05.720 --> 38:11.280]  CNN, why will not they join our pledge to disavow political violence of all types?
[38:11.280 --> 38:12.280]  They won't.
[38:12.280 --> 38:13.280]  That's right.
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.640]  Wolf Blitzer had on the guest that said the guy that, you know, shot the congressman
[38:15.640 --> 38:19.120]  in the cops and everything last week, uh, and congressman's colleagues still fighting
[38:19.120 --> 38:20.120]  for his life.
[38:20.120 --> 38:23.640]  And all these surgeries later, he has the guest on saying this man wasn't evil.
[38:23.640 --> 38:26.080]  He was just tired of politics and everybody nods their head on the show.
[38:26.080 --> 38:27.080]  It's like, absolutely.
[38:27.080 --> 38:31.560]  I mean, we need to hear from Wolf Blitzer that he disavows people saying this was quote
[38:31.560 --> 38:36.800]  just political because God forbid somebody then find Wolf Blitzer next time or another
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.080]  CNN host the next time they're doing a live remote, just walks up and pumps rounds into
[38:41.080 --> 38:43.160]  them saying it's just politics.
[38:43.160 --> 38:44.160]  That would be horrible.
[38:44.160 --> 38:45.160]  Well, that's the whole point.
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.880]  That's what I keep telling them as I go, look, you guys got to understand something here.
[38:48.880 --> 38:50.760]  I am trying to keep you safe.
[38:50.760 --> 38:55.520]  And if you say, Hey, it's open season on Trump supporters, it's open season on Alex
[38:55.520 --> 38:57.720]  Jones, Mike Cervig, the independent media.
[38:57.720 --> 39:02.080]  If you're inciting your listeners and viewers to murder us, I can assure you if any harm
[39:02.080 --> 39:05.880]  befalls either of us, you have no idea what will be unleashed.
[39:05.880 --> 39:07.600]  So you need, you need the peace.
[39:07.600 --> 39:08.600]  I don't need it.
[39:08.600 --> 39:09.600]  I'm not afraid.
[39:09.600 --> 39:12.160]  If things go hot, Hey, I'm not afraid of anything.
[39:12.160 --> 39:13.680]  Neither are people on my team.
[39:13.680 --> 39:14.680]  All right.
[39:14.680 --> 39:15.680]  We though, we have daughters.
[39:15.680 --> 39:16.680]  We like art.
[39:16.680 --> 39:18.040]  We like culture.
[39:18.040 --> 39:19.520]  There's nothing good about civil war.
[39:19.520 --> 39:23.260]  So you got to understand that another point too is that we do have security and we've
[39:23.260 --> 39:25.360]  got in each major room weapons lockers.
[39:25.360 --> 39:26.360]  Exactly.
[39:26.360 --> 39:29.400]  And they have, and I, when I travel, even they go, Oh, you know, are you by yourself?
[39:29.400 --> 39:32.880]  And I go, if you think I'm by myself, I'm not obviously not going to blow up, sec or
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.440]  talk about what I carry or whatever.
[39:34.440 --> 39:40.600]  But the, the bigger point is CNN also hosted Thomas DeMasimo, who jumped the stage in Ohio
[39:40.600 --> 39:43.100]  Trump rally attempted to assassinate Trump.
[39:43.100 --> 39:48.320]  He had tweeted out gun emojis about Trump and said that he wanted to be a martyr.
[39:48.320 --> 39:51.960]  CNN put him on and they called him a protester.
[39:51.960 --> 39:54.160]  That kid and a Vegas, I call him a kid.
[39:54.160 --> 39:55.400]  He's actually a terrorist.
[39:55.400 --> 39:57.440]  The BBC did a profile on him.
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.320]  He tried to grab a gun from Secret Service and he was going to go try to murder Trump.
[40:01.320 --> 40:06.400]  They treat these guys like heroes and then they come at us and try to pin things on us.
[40:06.400 --> 40:08.800]  When they're the ones who are saying, we will give you an audience.
[40:08.800 --> 40:10.000]  We will give you a platform.
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.240]  If you try, let's be clear.
[40:11.240 --> 40:12.240]  Let's be clear.
[40:12.240 --> 40:14.400]  I want to get into the Russia issues and a few other her in a moment and we got a bunch
[40:14.400 --> 40:15.400]  of guests coming up today.
[40:15.400 --> 40:18.600]  But Mike Cernovich in studio with us visiting us here in Austin as we gear up to launch
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.120]  more shows and a larger network system on radio and TV.
[40:23.120 --> 40:26.400]  I want to just pull back just briefly on Megan Kelly because you've got a lot of prominent
[40:26.400 --> 40:27.560]  folks texting you.
[40:27.560 --> 40:31.280]  I've got them texting me saying, yes, we're sick of Megan Kelly.
[40:31.280 --> 40:32.280]  She's been defeated.
[40:32.280 --> 40:34.440]  She had 3.5 million viewers.
[40:34.440 --> 40:38.000]  When Dateline NBC used to have 15 million, when she first took over the show, it had
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.400]  six, seven million.
[40:39.400 --> 40:41.440]  People don't want to see their hit pieces.
[40:41.440 --> 40:44.960]  They're sick of the hype when the mainstream media hype something, everybody tunes out
[40:44.960 --> 40:45.960]  of it.
[40:45.960 --> 40:51.040]  Meanwhile, again, we're not bragging, I had over 15 million views just on Facebook and
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.960]  YouTube last week, just on our handful of Megan Kelly videos.
[40:55.960 --> 40:57.720]  The average video had about a million views.
[40:57.720 --> 40:58.720]  I mean, that's crazy.
[40:58.720 --> 41:00.160]  We had one that had 4 million views.
[41:00.160 --> 41:02.120]  You had a couple with over 4 million views.
[41:02.120 --> 41:03.120]  Paul Watson.
[41:03.120 --> 41:04.400]  I mean, it's a joke.
[41:04.400 --> 41:13.200]  It's an absolute joke plus I'm airing those videos here on air with an audience of conservatively.
[41:13.200 --> 41:14.200]  So conservative.
[41:14.200 --> 41:18.280]  That's, you know, people that are rated listening on commercial radio and we can see on the
[41:18.280 --> 41:21.120]  screens listening 4 plus million a day.
[41:21.120 --> 41:22.120]  It's a joke.
[41:22.120 --> 41:25.800]  And our overhead is probably one tenth of what Megan Kelly's is.
[41:25.800 --> 41:28.960]  It still costs millions of dollars to run something like this and make sure support
[41:28.960 --> 41:29.960]  we're able to do it.
[41:29.960 --> 41:32.240]  But this is just biblical.
[41:32.240 --> 41:33.240]  What a joke.
[41:33.240 --> 41:39.320]  I can't believe that her ratings have gone 7 million, 5 million, 3 million.
[41:39.320 --> 41:45.440]  I mean, she is falling like a shooting star from her old highs of 5 million at Fox.
[41:45.440 --> 41:46.720]  Then she attacks Trump.
[41:46.720 --> 41:48.520]  It drops to 2 million.
[41:48.520 --> 41:49.760]  Then they get rid of her.
[41:49.760 --> 41:52.600]  Now they're talking about you have your sources getting rid of her contract.
[41:52.600 --> 41:53.600]  Yeah.
[41:53.600 --> 41:57.560]  And so that's the whole thing is at this point, we're actually doing her a favor.
[41:57.560 --> 41:59.680]  She isn't in our league anymore.
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.680]  Maybe she was at one time.
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.320]  Megan Kelly, Tom Brokaw, they're just not in our league.
[42:03.320 --> 42:05.160]  They can't compete with us at all.
[42:05.160 --> 42:09.720]  So yeah, I'm getting text messages from all kinds of high level people from the government
[42:09.720 --> 42:10.720]  media.
[42:10.720 --> 42:11.720]  You name it.
[42:11.720 --> 42:14.760]  Even people from Hollywood saying, yeah, you know, at this point, you know, even one
[42:14.760 --> 42:20.200]  person who's a publicist for all the Hollywood people said, at this point, she is so dead
[42:20.200 --> 42:23.400]  and desperate that you're doing her a favor by talking about her.
[42:23.400 --> 42:25.160]  You guys are way bigger than she is.
[42:25.160 --> 42:26.320]  They want us to move on now.
[42:26.320 --> 42:30.280]  That's why I was telling Alex earlier, you know, I said, why even release the audio
[42:30.280 --> 42:31.280]  now?
[42:31.280 --> 42:32.280]  She, she's dead.
[42:32.280 --> 42:33.280]  We did autopsy.
[42:33.280 --> 42:34.280]  We've inspect.
[42:34.280 --> 42:38.840]  Well, we said, we said we were going to do it, but I'm going to do this very, very delicately
[42:38.840 --> 42:42.320]  is the look at which the West says of the East, we're just going to go through and show
[42:42.320 --> 42:45.840]  the lies of the piece that we're going to show where she edited stuff, how she manipulated
[42:45.840 --> 42:47.240]  it, what I actually said.
[42:47.240 --> 42:51.600]  It's just, it's like making a documentary, but I'm going to put a deadline on a Friday
[42:51.600 --> 42:54.000]  to try to just put it out.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.160]  It's not fun though, listening to hours and hours of her or myself.
[42:57.160 --> 42:58.600]  I mean, she's boring, dude.
[42:58.600 --> 42:59.600]  Nope.
[42:59.600 --> 43:04.280]  That's the whole point is nobody wants to watch Vapid Megan Kelly, boring Megan Kelly.
[43:04.280 --> 43:05.440]  Nobody wants to listen to her.
[43:05.440 --> 43:09.520]  They would rather watch you on Joe Rogan with the Joe Rogan podcast.
[43:09.520 --> 43:11.560]  That is the most downloaded podcast of all time.
[43:11.560 --> 43:12.560]  Exactly.
[43:12.560 --> 43:16.480]  So if you're in a room and there was something like that, that analytics were through the
[43:16.480 --> 43:19.320]  roof and they got bigger as you talk longer.
[43:19.320 --> 43:22.160]  So you guys were going for four hours and then Joe was like, Hey, we got to stop.
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.360]  And I was like, I don't know.
[43:23.360 --> 43:25.480]  Maybe Joe was like a little bit jealous or something.
[43:25.480 --> 43:32.000]  No, he had to go do a, no, Joe's huge, probably bigger than I am overall for his total rage.
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.320]  And it's definitely smarter.
[43:33.320 --> 43:34.320]  He knows everything I know.
[43:34.320 --> 43:36.600]  He just, he's just, you know, kind of runs down the rail there.
[43:36.600 --> 43:37.600]  Talk about it.
[43:37.600 --> 43:38.600]  He knows what he's doing.
[43:38.600 --> 43:39.600]  No, he had to go do a sold out show.
[43:39.600 --> 43:40.600]  Gotcha.
[43:40.600 --> 43:42.840]  So what he is is a super workhorse.
[43:42.840 --> 43:43.840]  Gotcha.
[43:43.840 --> 43:44.840]  Well, you have to be.
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.080]  So the point though is the longer you guys talked, it spiked when I started watching
[43:49.080 --> 43:53.400]  you guys were doing 10,000 live viewers and then it just kept going crazy.
[43:53.400 --> 43:56.680]  You guys would have had probably, you probably would have crashed YouTube.
[43:56.680 --> 44:01.280]  So the point is for those of you listening us, Alex Jones can talk for four hours.
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.920]  The longer he talks, the more people listen, Megyn Kelly is the opposite effect.
[44:05.920 --> 44:10.360]  You hear her talk for 30 seconds, she's like, Oh God, another, it's like, it's like pretending
[44:10.360 --> 44:13.400]  you're interested in a girl when you're dating, you're like, Oh gosh, she's so true.
[44:13.400 --> 44:14.760]  But I'm going to walk that thing back.
[44:14.760 --> 44:15.760]  You did about Joe.
[44:15.760 --> 44:18.360]  Joe is one of the most unjealous people I know of anybody.
[44:18.360 --> 44:19.600]  He's super confident.
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.360]  And I'm going to say, you know, a masculine man in the classical side, he's smart.
[44:23.360 --> 44:24.360]  He's tough.
[44:24.360 --> 44:25.360]  He's funny.
[44:25.360 --> 44:26.360]  The truth was he's got family.
[44:26.360 --> 44:27.360]  Like I do.
[44:27.360 --> 44:28.360]  He had family stuff that day.
[44:28.360 --> 44:31.280]  He, he, he, he got there a little bit late like we did.
[44:31.280 --> 44:32.680]  He's like, dude, great to see you.
[44:32.680 --> 44:33.680]  Man.
[44:33.680 --> 44:34.680]  It was like smog that day.
[44:34.680 --> 44:35.680]  I felt sick.
[44:35.680 --> 44:37.560]  Uh, he goes, let's just do like an hour.
[44:37.560 --> 44:38.560]  All right.
[44:38.560 --> 44:40.480]  Well, then we start drinking a little bit of whiskey.
[44:40.480 --> 44:42.880]  He's not a big drinker, but for energy, we start drinking a little bit of whiskey.
[44:42.880 --> 44:45.920]  He goes, yeah, man, I got a sold out shut and I, it'll be great.
[44:45.920 --> 44:46.920]  You want to go?
[44:46.920 --> 44:49.560]  You know, cause maybe we get some dinner after, if not, I can't have dinner after this with
[44:49.560 --> 44:50.560]  you and Eddie.
[44:50.560 --> 44:51.560]  If you're going to that steakhouse.
[44:51.560 --> 44:52.560]  I'm like, no, let's just get it.
[44:52.560 --> 44:55.480]  He goes, all right, let's do an hour and a half and you know, Eddie's here.
[44:55.480 --> 44:56.480]  Come on.
[44:56.480 --> 44:57.480]  Let's go in here.
[44:57.480 --> 44:58.480]  And then we did it.
[44:58.480 --> 45:03.320]  And then he got woke up and then he went four hours and then he's like, God, I'm exhausted.
[45:03.320 --> 45:05.200]  And then he went and did a two hour show.
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.120]  That's what, that's what really happened behind the scenes because everybody was asking me.
[45:09.120 --> 45:12.440]  They go, dude, the ratings kept getting higher and higher and higher and higher and high.
[45:12.440 --> 45:14.320]  It was like super bowl level ratings.
[45:14.320 --> 45:15.320]  So it's good.
[45:15.320 --> 45:16.320]  It's good that we covered.
[45:16.320 --> 45:19.760]  That's the whole point of doing real journalism is to give people behind the scenes and people
[45:19.760 --> 45:21.240]  can't get enough of that.
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.760]  But with Megan Kelly, nobody wants to hear the audio man.
[45:24.760 --> 45:25.760]  I'm telling you.
[45:25.760 --> 45:28.520]  I mean, if you want to release it, you know, you're the boss, you can do what you want
[45:28.520 --> 45:29.520]  to do.
[45:29.520 --> 45:30.520]  But I think people are so bored.
[45:30.520 --> 45:31.520]  I just don't want to listen to the torture.
[45:31.520 --> 45:32.520]  No, I couldn't do it.
[45:32.520 --> 45:36.120]  But frankly, I get a little annoying too, because it was just the most dumb.
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.000]  It was 30 minutes on each subject.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.560]  Just trying to get me to, because, and you know what?
[45:40.560 --> 45:44.000]  I screwed up because I'd finally just go, what is this going to end?
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  You're not asking me real questions.
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.680]  She would just cut to me going, because it wasn't me even with gotcha questions.
[45:48.680 --> 45:51.960]  Like, dude, you just asked me like nine times about Sandy York.
[45:51.960 --> 45:53.160]  I told you the answer.
[45:53.160 --> 45:58.120]  Well, it's just, nobody, that's the thing is I'll just tell you right now that it would
[45:58.120 --> 46:01.080]  be torture to assign that to anybody to do.
[46:01.080 --> 46:03.960]  Because I couldn't, if you said, hey, sir, if you want to help me with this, I would
[46:03.960 --> 46:07.560]  be like, you know, I love you, Alex, but dude, I, I can't handle this man.
[46:07.560 --> 46:08.560]  I cannot handle.
[46:08.560 --> 46:09.760]  I barely could watch her.
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.800]  I had to drink, drink wine to watch, even watch her for a few minutes, cut into pieces.
[46:14.800 --> 46:17.120]  Because that's how we're not just saying that.
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.600]  It's no, it's true.
[46:18.600 --> 46:20.320]  I mean, no, it's true.
[46:20.320 --> 46:21.320]  I don't watch her.
[46:21.320 --> 46:22.320]  I don't watch Megan Kelly.
[46:22.320 --> 46:25.000]  The people who listen to us and watch us don't watch Megan Kelly.
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.840]  Even the liberals who are on her side, they're telling me, God, that was terrible, dude.
[46:28.840 --> 46:31.240]  I'll never watch her again, she's so boring.
[46:31.240 --> 46:32.240]  She has nothing.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.240]  Let's think about Joe Rogan, though.
[46:33.240 --> 46:34.240]  He's like a real family guy.
[46:34.240 --> 46:37.440]  Like, I think he said he's been at a children's birthday party before and then shopping and
[46:37.440 --> 46:41.640]  traffic and you're like, you're like in this office and, you know, LA, I mean, this is
[46:41.640 --> 46:42.640]  the real world, folks.
[46:42.640 --> 46:43.640]  He's too.
[46:43.640 --> 46:44.640]  This isn't teleprompters.
[46:44.640 --> 46:45.640]  This isn't pre-screen.
[46:45.640 --> 46:46.640]  We're just dads.
[46:46.640 --> 46:47.640]  We're just people here fighting.
[46:47.640 --> 46:51.080]  Well, I mean, your fame and Joe Rogan's fame is, I don't want anything to do with that.
[46:51.080 --> 46:52.560]  So we're, we're in Austin, actually.
[46:52.560 --> 46:53.720]  I wouldn't even say it's fame.
[46:53.720 --> 46:55.640]  It's more like we have just connected with people.
[46:55.640 --> 46:59.520]  But, but the point is, though, for those people who have never hung out with you, we were
[46:59.520 --> 47:03.640]  in Austin and everywhere we go, people are looking and talking, sending people out to
[47:03.640 --> 47:05.160]  talk to him, checking it.
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.960]  So, you know, just from my own standpoint, like Alex Jones is a level of fame.
[47:08.960 --> 47:10.960]  Well, I can't imagine Rogan fame.
[47:10.960 --> 47:11.960]  That would not be fine.
[47:11.960 --> 47:15.360]  Here's the only reason to have that message.
[47:15.360 --> 47:19.880]  For all the conservatives that want to kiss the mainstream media's butt and the congressman
[47:19.880 --> 47:25.000]  that get upset when CNN or NBC says something, it's only because they're able to get to
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.560]  you and make you think that there's a controversy and then you start waffling.
[47:29.560 --> 47:30.560]  And then that's happened.
[47:30.560 --> 47:33.120]  I mean, there have been times where I thought I was a little bit wrong, so to just do the
[47:33.120 --> 47:34.120]  right thing.
[47:34.120 --> 47:35.120]  I admitted I was wrong.
[47:35.120 --> 47:37.040]  Then they all freak out and think I'm weak and it gets worse.
[47:37.040 --> 47:41.440]  So it's almost like I can't even say I'm wrong when I'm wrong, even though I want to, because
[47:41.440 --> 47:42.440]  the enemy twisted.
[47:42.440 --> 47:43.440]  No, no, no.
[47:43.440 --> 47:46.280]  So I've actually had this conversation with Shauna because, you know, you're, you're
[47:46.280 --> 47:47.800]  talking to your wife, people who love you.
[47:47.800 --> 47:51.760]  And I go, I go, babe, if we lived in a decent world, there are things that I would apologize
[47:51.760 --> 47:52.760]  for.
[47:52.760 --> 47:53.760]  I would say, you know, I went too far on that.
[47:53.760 --> 47:54.760]  I didn't mean that.
[47:54.760 --> 47:56.600]  You know, we do not live in a decent world.
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.680]  We live in a world where an apology or human decency or Christian morality is blood in
[48:00.680 --> 48:01.680]  the water.
[48:01.680 --> 48:02.680]  You can't show any weakness.
[48:02.680 --> 48:03.680]  Damn right.
[48:03.680 --> 48:04.680]  You double down.
[48:04.680 --> 48:08.000]  So the more they confront me, I just say, whatever I put them on the defense, I go hard after
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  them.
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  No, no, we don't.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  These people have no morality.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  Exactly.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.520]  Because the people they've got following them are the followers, the idiots.
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.600]  And I'm sorry, we don't need you to change the world.
[48:16.600 --> 48:21.520]  You want to be scared of CNN and scared of Megan Kelly and scared of Tom Brokaw.
[48:21.520 --> 48:22.560]  Be scared of them.
[48:22.560 --> 48:24.400]  We have audiences bigger.
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.840]  It doesn't matter if they make 50 times the money, I want people to be awake and free.
[48:28.840 --> 48:29.840]  We're going to break.
[48:29.840 --> 48:30.840]  We're to come back into Russia.
[48:30.840 --> 48:31.840]  It's the big enchilada.
[48:31.840 --> 48:33.840]  I think this is how they undermine Trump.
[48:33.840 --> 48:36.840]  This is how they get his base to really turn against him because we've been on the inside
[48:36.840 --> 48:37.840]  of this.
[48:37.840 --> 48:38.840]  You've got big sources.
[48:38.840 --> 48:42.040]  We know he's been against the war against Syria.
[48:42.040 --> 48:43.640]  They're trying to manipulate him right now.
[48:43.640 --> 48:46.560]  The US and Russia are in a major showdown.
[48:46.560 --> 48:52.920]  First off though, I've decided quite frankly to bring in some of the biggest sales in our
[48:52.920 --> 48:53.920]  history.
[48:53.920 --> 48:56.960]  Last year or so, we have more and more big sales because we've done it.
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.360]  We've habitualized the audience to always having sales because you don't buy anything
[49:01.360 --> 49:02.360]  if there's not a sale.
[49:02.360 --> 49:06.440]  But I'm not like some of the big shops out there that raise their price and then have
[49:06.440 --> 49:09.280]  a sale, but it's really at the regular retail.
[49:09.280 --> 49:11.920]  You'll notice over the years, the products are the same price, even though with some
[49:11.920 --> 49:19.280]  products the price has gone up for us, like Brain Force and others, like DNA Force.
[49:19.280 --> 49:24.360]  And so quite frankly, I guess I'm going to have to have a new low price that is the sale
[49:24.360 --> 49:30.120]  and then the sale price is the regular price because that's how we fund our operation.
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've had free shipping for a week.
[49:32.000 --> 49:33.680]  It's going to end in a couple of days.

[54:21.160 --> 54:25.280]  We've got this supposed right-wing terror attack that we decry when one Islamist, one
[54:25.280 --> 54:26.280]  Muslim killed.
[54:26.280 --> 54:29.040]  A lot of weird stuff going on around the story.
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.120]  The man was already hurt in the street with people around him and then was in front of
[54:32.120 --> 54:33.840]  a mosque and then somebody ran into them.
[54:33.840 --> 54:37.880]  So we're trying to figure out exactly what's going on there.
[54:37.880 --> 54:42.320]  We've got a bunch of other big developments, but the big one is US-led coalition downing
[54:42.320 --> 54:47.000]  a Syrian plane, act of aggression and support for terrorists.
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.280]  Moscow views the US-led coalition attack on Syrian government military jet as an act
[54:51.280 --> 54:52.280]  of aggression.
[54:52.280 --> 54:58.360]  Now if you search engine, President Trump, no boots on the ground, no Syrian war, you'll
[54:58.360 --> 55:06.200]  see our article that Paul Watson wrote four days before mainstream media wrote the exact
[55:06.200 --> 55:10.240]  same article because that was real White House sources.
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.400]  The only reason I point that out is time and time and time and time and time and time and
[55:15.400 --> 55:19.400]  time and time again, we break and roll out what's really going on.
[55:19.400 --> 55:21.200]  Trump said no to troops in Syria.
[55:21.200 --> 55:22.800]  His aides aren't so sure.
[55:22.800 --> 55:23.800]  McMaster and others.
[55:23.800 --> 55:27.680]  Now if you go back four days before that, just type in infowars.com.
[55:27.680 --> 55:29.440]  You don't search infowars.com.
[55:29.440 --> 55:35.440]  In Google, you put in infowars.com and then you type in Trump not planning writer's Syria
[55:35.440 --> 55:39.040]  war, no boots on the ground and you'll get Paul Watson's article.
[55:39.040 --> 55:41.760]  If you guys can't find it, call Paul.
[55:41.760 --> 55:43.200]  We must show everyone this.
[55:43.200 --> 55:46.480]  You must show it or just shut the show down because we have to show folks that we're not
[55:46.480 --> 55:47.480]  the fake news.
[55:47.480 --> 55:51.800]  How we set it first from our sources and then how four days later, word for word, that's
[55:51.800 --> 55:55.480]  what the president came out and said because that was from the president.
[55:55.480 --> 56:01.680]  Well, and I broke the story too, how McMaster was pushing for a troop ground war in Syria
[56:01.680 --> 56:07.000]  to McMaster's war before Eli Lake did and those guys in the fake news media do.
[56:07.000 --> 56:14.240]  So when will NBC do a special on storiesinfowars.com had before everybody else?
[56:14.240 --> 56:15.240]  Why is that?
[56:15.240 --> 56:16.240]  Do they want to pick two or three?
[56:16.240 --> 56:17.240]  We won't do them.
[56:17.240 --> 56:18.240]  I've asked my crew that we need to do that.
[56:18.240 --> 56:21.280]  Yeah, you need to do a big because we're always so busy covering the latest.
[56:21.280 --> 56:23.600]  But yeah, but you got to tell me you had some of the same sources.
[56:23.600 --> 56:27.000]  So tell folks the battle because the big deal is here, not even about credit.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.640]  They're trying to maneuver Trump.
[56:28.640 --> 56:30.200]  They've got the artillery on the ground.
[56:30.200 --> 56:31.200]  They've got it all set up.
[56:31.200 --> 56:34.440]  They're trying to tell him to take out ISIS, but we have McMaster saying he wants to take
[56:34.440 --> 56:35.440]  out Assad as well.
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.640]  Yeah, this is they're going to get the world war three.
[56:37.640 --> 56:38.920]  They want Iran.
[56:38.920 --> 56:39.920]  They want it.
[56:39.920 --> 56:40.920]  They want to drag in Russia.
[56:40.920 --> 56:42.440]  So they're talking about we need to worry about Iran.
[56:42.440 --> 56:44.240]  We need to worry about Syria.
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.000]  Even though in Syria, you can actually be a Christian in Syria.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.280]  You can't be a Christian Saudi Arabia, but we're selling weapons and arms to Saudi Arabia
[56:52.280 --> 56:53.440]  where you can't be a Christian.
[56:53.440 --> 56:54.800]  You can't be a Jew.
[56:54.800 --> 56:58.160]  But in Syria, you can be a Christian.
[56:58.160 --> 56:59.160]  Wow.
[56:59.160 --> 57:00.600]  What is the common theme here?
[57:00.600 --> 57:03.840]  This is ultimately a war on Christianity.
[57:03.840 --> 57:05.760]  That is what the fake news media is doing.
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.000]  Any country where Christianity is allowed, they want war and carnage.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Got a call, Paul.
[57:11.000 --> 57:12.840]  I just, I have this OCD thing.
[57:12.840 --> 57:16.840]  I didn't used to be OCD, but then if I have an article and I know we broke it and we can't
[57:16.840 --> 57:17.840]  find it, I can't do the show.
[57:17.840 --> 57:18.840]  Keep going.
[57:18.840 --> 57:19.840]  I have to go up here.
[57:19.840 --> 57:20.840]  Yeah.
[57:20.840 --> 57:21.840]  Okay.
[57:21.840 --> 57:23.720]  Go to my, they can also go to my medium, my medium.com page McMaster wants broad war
[57:23.720 --> 57:24.720]  in Syria.
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.720]  So McMaster has been playing that's at my medium.com forward slash at Cernovich.
[57:28.720 --> 57:33.600]  That was another story how McMaster is pushing hard for ground war in Syria.
[57:33.600 --> 57:34.760]  Now here's what you'll learn.
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.480]  I learned this from Christian Orthodox people that visited Syria.
[57:39.480 --> 57:43.200]  You can actually, so yeah, the Treyas McMaster have taken over the NSE.
[57:43.200 --> 57:45.480]  They want massive ground war in Syria.
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.720]  That was April 9th.
[57:46.720 --> 57:50.720]  I had also done a story before that where I talked about how McMaster had been manipulating
[57:50.720 --> 57:55.400]  intelligence supports for the president and wanted 150,000 ground troops in Syria.
[57:55.400 --> 57:57.880]  And then of course people go, oh, you're fake news.
[57:57.880 --> 57:59.400]  There's no ground war in Syria.
[57:59.400 --> 58:04.000]  You, yeah, because it takes a long time to manipulate these things in action.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  I mean, think about the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.520]  That's something the fake news media will never talk about.
[58:09.520 --> 58:15.040]  Why don't we do a special on NBC or ABC about the Gulf of Tonkin incident and how there
[58:15.040 --> 58:21.000]  have been that false flag operations to drag us into a war.
[58:21.000 --> 58:22.200]  Media never wants to talk about that.
[58:22.200 --> 58:23.880]  I find that fascinating.
[58:23.880 --> 58:27.920]  So could there be another Gulf of Tonkin incident?
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.520]  Could this plane being shot down be another fake Gulf of Tonkin incident to drag us into
[58:33.520 --> 58:34.520]  war?
[58:34.520 --> 58:35.520]  And let's be clear.
[58:35.520 --> 58:37.160]  They'll say that we're saying no plane got shot down.
[58:37.160 --> 58:38.160]  No.
[58:38.160 --> 58:41.040]  You can give the military orders that Trump hasn't actually given because he's turned the military
[58:41.040 --> 58:42.040]  loose.
[58:42.040 --> 58:44.320]  People inside then can use that to try to start a war.
[58:44.320 --> 58:45.520]  We know that's their strategy.
[58:45.520 --> 58:48.440]  You broke it from your sources the same weekend we broke it.
[58:48.440 --> 58:49.760]  So we did show your site.
[58:49.760 --> 58:50.760]  Yes, he was right first.
[58:50.760 --> 58:51.760]  We was right.
[58:51.760 --> 58:52.760]  We found the article.
[58:52.760 --> 58:53.760]  At least he had it.
[58:53.760 --> 58:59.320]  The first shipment of super blue sold out in one week.
[58:59.320 --> 59:02.680]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners and since then people are beating

[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:35.160]  war.
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:45.840]  Anyways, ladies and gentlemen, Mike Cernovich is here.
[1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:50.240]  We know the bigger story is they're trying to start a war in Syria with this proxy war
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:53.920]  where Trump says they're not going to have a wider war when you get rid of ISIS, al-Qaeda,
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:55.560]  but then others want to start a larger war.
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:56.880]  They're shipping in the artillery.
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:00:57.880]  They're setting it all up.
[1:00:57.880 --> 1:00:58.880]  They're getting it ready.
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:02.560]  Paul Watson's coming up in the next segment to get into a supposed right wing terror attack
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:03.760]  in London and more.
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:05.800]  But Mike Cernovich, get into the breaking news.
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:09.480]  I know you told me about this yesterday from your sources and that you were going to be
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:11.680]  releasing this soon, but I guess it's already breaking.
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:12.680]  Tell us about it.
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:17.400]  Yes, so I found out from multiple sources now have confirmed it, and I believe you maybe
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:22.560]  wrote about this a year ago, but the Clinton Foundation is actually laundering money and
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:27.800]  paying off ISIS to protect a certain cement factory in Syria.
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:28.800]  This is breaking news.
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:33.400]  I just got this from the top level people personally inspected it.
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:38.920]  So there are all these cement factories in Syria, and what is happening is that the cement
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:43.760]  factory is paying money to the Clinton Global Initiative, and then the Clinton Global Initiative
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:49.480]  is using its contractors and sources to pay off ISIS to not bomb this cement factory.
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:50.920]  So the story is still developing.
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:54.960]  I haven't broken it yet on my medium.com, but it's still in draft form, but I wanted
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:55.960]  to get that out right away.
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:57.640]  I meant to break it last night, but we got so busy.
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:03.360]  So we have proof now, sources, the most reliable sources you can have that the Clinton Foundation
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:09.220]  is actually giving money to ISIS as part of an extortion racket with the cement factory.
[1:02:09.220 --> 1:02:12.840]  So yes, this story here has now been confirmed.
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:17.840]  This is now not what you say possible.
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:19.360]  This is actually true.
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:21.960]  The Clinton Foundation, they're still doing it.
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:23.240]  They're paying money to ISIS.
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.800]  They are funding terrorism.
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:28.280]  So when you say Hillary Clinton is a terrorist, she is a terrorist.
[1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:29.280]  They're paying money to ISIS.
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:30.720]  It can no longer be denied.
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:31.720]  We have confirmation.
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:35.280]  And I believe you broke that story before it's still ongoing.
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:37.200]  Well, I don't mean to freak out about who breaks stories.
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.960]  I can't stand it when I can't find one, one that was particularly from a high level
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:41.960]  White House source.
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:42.960]  I remember writing it.
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:43.960]  I remember doing it.
[1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:45.480]  It was separate from the one from your sources about McMaster.
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:46.480]  It was backing that up.
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:51.000]  But it was from the president himself saying about your story from your sources that, yes,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:52.520]  we're not going to expand the war.
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:53.800]  I'm not going along with this.
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:56.720]  And three days later, Bloomberg picked up on that.
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:02.480]  That's the obsession with not being able to ever find myself, the information to show
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:03.480]  it.
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:08.160]  But, I mean, of course, at Nauseam, we spearheaded exposing that ISIS previously was al-Qaeda.
[1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:12.000]  And six years ago, they launched the Arab Spring, and they overthrew all these governments.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.960]  And the news promoted it publicly.
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:17.520]  And then they tried to be al-Qaeda's air force and ISIS's air force.
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.160]  And our guests, like Colonel Schaefer and others, spearheaded exposing that.
[1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:27.040]  Then Senator Paul covered it, then Senator, the guy from Texas, Cruz, covered it.
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:31.800]  And so, yes, when Trump then later says, you funded ISIS, you created ISIS, Hillary, and
[1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:36.400]  Obama, that's true, the media then thinks we're all geographically and geopolitically
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:41.400]  and militarily and historically completely illiterate.
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:45.920]  And so they just say, no, you're liars, just like they think that we don't know that Comey
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.040]  said, two testimonies, that Trump never tried to get him to obstruct justice, and we even
[1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:51.040]  have the video clips.
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:52.040]  They just say we're liars.
[1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:53.040]  So it's that frustration.
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.040]  It's not with you.
[1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:55.040]  It's not with the crew.
[1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:57.240]  I just, occasionally, I never used to be OCD.
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:01.560]  I've got this thing now where I just, I know what the news was.
[1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:02.600]  I know what it was.
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:06.000]  I know what it said, which we already found a bunch where you said it, so it doesn't matter.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.080]  The point is, that's not the bigger issue.
[1:04:08.080 --> 1:04:13.560]  I'm pissed off, excuse me, because I realize they're about to try to start a major war to
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:15.640]  take control of things from Trump.
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:17.640]  So his one blind spot is saying, I trust the military.
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:18.640]  We have the military.
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:19.640]  He's good overall.
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:20.640]  They're good people.
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:25.520]  The globalists at the top of the military can use this to then basically destabilize
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:29.960]  Trump or start major wars, because even though he's given them the main directives, clearly
[1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:31.760]  people above him are trying to start a major war.
[1:04:31.760 --> 1:04:36.240]  Well, and the chess pieces are now being moved into a place where they now, Mattis now has
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.320]  his authorization to increase troop levels in Afghanistan.
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:42.120]  So if you know where the chess board is going, you can see the moves.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:43.640]  We are headed towards the World War III.
[1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:45.920]  The globalists want to do anything to start it.
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:49.160]  That's why they're going to lie, but you're here in the real news here all the time.
[1:04:49.160 --> 1:04:53.160]  And I'm glad that you're OCD, because you have to be, because there's so much going
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:54.160]  on.
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:04:55.160]  But it didn't used to be.
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:56.160]  It's this thing now.
[1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:57.160]  It's bad.
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:04:58.160]  I've got to just learn.
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:04:59.160]  It doesn't exist.
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:00.160]  We never said it.
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.160]  Isn't it?
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.160]  It's not real.
[1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:05.440]  Lost in the constant fake news cycle, we have forgotten the building tensions in Syria
[1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:10.280]  until this morning, when news broke of a Syrian army plane being shot down by a United States
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:11.280]  F-18.
[1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:15.600]  This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been downed by the United States since 2011.
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:20.040]  Washington justified the strike, claiming the jet-dropped bombs near US-backed forces,
[1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:23.160]  while officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS.
[1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:27.880]  Truth be told, these are most likely the same group, but we should be asking John McCain
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:28.880]  that question.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:34.520]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat US aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:39.080]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation
[1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:40.080]  to be over.
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:44.120]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:47.160]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia, while they are
[1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:49.400]  threatening him and our country.
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:53.680]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria
[1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:56.640]  in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:57.640]  Don't fall for it.
[1:05:57.640 --> 1:05:58.640]  Make America great again.
[1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:01.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:05.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:10.120]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:11.640]  to detoxify the body.
[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.520]  Stick metal and chemical defense support.
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:18.040]  It's made in the USA.
[1:06:18.040 --> 1:06:22.960]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:24.760]  the body and it supports the Info War.
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:27.040]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:30.600]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:35.480]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:36.600]  you can possibly get.
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:40.400]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:45.440]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you

[1:06:50.680 --> 1:06:53.400]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:13.800]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:18.160]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:23.480]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:41.440]  It's down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:44.160]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:48.840]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:19.400]  Alright earlier in the mainstream media, government cover us.
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:21.120]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:26.120]  Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios.
[1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:27.120]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:33.920]  Earlier in the last hour, I was getting into the big critical story that affects us all.
[1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:40.000]  A major Cuban Missile Crisis level showdown between the United States and Russia now because
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.720]  a second time the last month and a half, the United States has bombed an armored convoy
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:50.480]  that was battling ISIS forces, that's admitted, and then now a Syrian government war plane
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:56.800]  has been shot down reportedly by US forces, these was flying too close to US forces on
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.800]  the ground.
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:04.480]  Now a few months ago, back in April, the neo cons of McMaster and others on the National
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:10.240]  Security Council, the National Security Advisor was pushing for more trips on the ground and
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:13.160]  to go ahead and take out Assad as well.
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:19.360]  I talked to my White House sources and they said the president said absolutely not, that
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:22.960]  is not going to happen, it doesn't matter if they're pushing that, it's not going to
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:23.960]  happen.
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:27.680]  Paul Watson wrote the article, White House source, very high level source, very high
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:28.680]  level source.
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:34.440]  Trump pushes back against neo-conplan to invade Syria, that was the last time I talked to that
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:35.440]  high level source.
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.240]  Well that was back in April.
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:43.920]  It breaks it all down, then three days later, Bloomberg, AP, everybody reported the exact
[1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:49.040]  same thing, he pushed back, he said no, do not mass trips for this, they're putting
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:53.080]  artillery in, they put the marines in, they're gearing up for a wider war.
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:58.400]  So Trump is being truthful, Trump is sticking by what he said he would do.
[1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:03.320]  The problem is he's being ignored by the deep state on so many fronts and now you've got
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:09.840]  this major, major, major, major clash where anytime this could escalate.
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:16.600]  What happens if more US forces go in, what happens if a Russian aircraft or Syrian aircraft
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:22.040]  get shot down, what happens if US aircraft go in and the Russians shoot them down, things
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:25.920]  are escalating very, very quickly and we're on the wrong side when we're trying to take
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:29.120]  out the Assad government because he didn't start the Civil War.
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:34.400]  Paul Joseph Watson, our London Barrow Chief and the editor of infowars.com, joins us to
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:40.480]  talk about this but then another terror attack in London, this time one dead, this time we
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:47.000]  hear it's a right winger that did it and the leftist media is calling for war over it,
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:51.080]  they're not calling for unity and peace and love before the blood's even dry and we even
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:53.480]  know what happened so we'll cover both those stories.
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:55.640]  Paul, which one do you want to tackle first?
[1:10:55.640 --> 1:11:00.680]  Let's talk about the terror attack Alex because that's what I've been covering today.
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:06.280]  Again, right wing terrorists drove into a group of Muslims near a mosque in north London,
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:11.760]  trusting tragic reprehensible, we've decried violence on both sides for eternity, we've
[1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:17.040]  said that the lack of solutions to address Islamic terrorism will cause extremists on
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:21.920]  the other side of the equation to fill the vacuum, said that numerous times now it's
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:26.400]  happening but of course who's to blame, well it's us, we'll get into that but like you
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:31.440]  said Alex, I thought the proper way to respond, the reasonable way to respond to terror attacks
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:37.040]  was just for everybody to love each other and unite and tweet, pray for hashtags like
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:42.160]  candles, arrange pop concerts, sing, don't look back in anger, I thought that was how
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:47.360]  we were all supposed to respond to terrorism, strange Alex that today nobody on the left
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.360]  is responding in that way, they're calling for new laws, they're calling for Tommy Robinson
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.480]  to be arrested as a hate preacher, they're calling for me to be deported even though
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:01.320]  I'm a British citizen, doesn't quite work out, they're calling for Katie Hopkins to
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:06.920]  be arrested, isn't it strange Alex, how they're reacting in a completely different way to
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:12.640]  how they normally react to terrorist attacks, after numerous Islamic terrorist attacks
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:19.680]  over the past two years, we've had celebrities say that Muslims are being radicalized because
[1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:24.880]  they're not being given enough movie roles, there's not enough diversity in Hollywood
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:30.280]  and that's causing young Muslims to turn towards ISIS, well maybe Alex, we're just not giving
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:35.600]  enough movie roles to right wing violent extremists, maybe that's the result, that's the cause
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:39.360]  of this terror attack, so again, complete hypocrites.
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:45.120]  Well when I go to the mall, do I see Gap now, their main centerpiece is a woman in a jib,
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:48.960]  the leftist marches are handing out jibs, they're actually saying we need to accept
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.640]  them and accept Sharia then they'll stop killing us but they don't do that in the Middle East,
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:59.720]  they kill each other and the most radicals are then in charge and control the dialogue.
[1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:05.000]  No exactly, after every single Islamic attack they blame us because they say we might offend
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:10.080]  Muslims who then might become terrorists, well one that's the bigger tree of low expectations,
[1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:15.320]  you're saying that random Muslims will just turn into terrorists because they're offended,
[1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:20.160]  and two again it's the hypocrisy Alex, they're trying to equate this threat of right wing
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:27.040]  terrorism which we decry, the right disavows its fringe violent extremists, the left doesn't,
[1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:31.760]  you saw they were celebrating after the attack on Scalise last week, every single time there's
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:36.560]  an Islamist terror attack they make apologies for it, they stick their heads in the sand.
[1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:40.760]  And let me tell you Paul, it's creepy watching a bunch of mainly old New Yorkers that look
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:45.240]  completely wimpy, I'm not bashing old folks, a lot of old folks are really tough and awesome,
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:50.200]  they're patriots but liberal old people, all chicken-necked, all weird, wearing their rainbow
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:56.840]  shirts, clapping and getting off on the simulated murder of Trump, it's just they're such hypocrites,
[1:13:56.840 --> 1:14:03.360]  they're such frauds, they never stick by anything that's logical and they are just lusting
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:05.160]  after violence.
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:11.360]  Exactly, and I mean the heart of it is they use Muslims, they use minorities, brown people
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.520]  as human shields for their argument because they have no argument, they can't defend
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:21.360]  logically their argument on anything, so they just grab an ethnic minority and put them
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:25.880]  up in front and say well if you're attacking that person then you're a racist and before
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:32.440]  we even get to having an argument, but here's the fact, Islamic terrorists have killed 1,263
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:39.960]  people in the last 23 days alone Alex, that's the grand total for Ramadan so far.
[1:14:39.960 --> 1:14:44.720]  So for people to take these sporadic right-wing terror attacks which are deplorable and we
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:51.840]  disavow them and make any kind of comparison to the mechanized industrial bloodshed carried
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:57.040]  out in the name of Islam on a daily basis is intellectually dishonest and crass.
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:02.040]  Just in the time we've been discussing this today, two more Islamic terror attacks in
[1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:06.680]  Europe, one in Paris a guy tried to blow up some police in a vehicle, another guy in
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:11.480]  London shouting al-ar-Aqbar with knives, they arrested him, tried to attack a policeman,
[1:15:11.480 --> 1:15:14.400]  within minutes they said not terror related.
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:19.800]  So just in the time we were reacting to this, we had two more attempted Islamic terror attacks
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:25.520]  to make any kind of comparison is completely dishonest, but again if you leave that vacuum,
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:30.480]  if you don't have actual solutions and border security deporting terrorists, then it's going
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:34.960]  to create a vacuum for actual extremists on the right who become desperate and try to
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  fill it.
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:38.720]  This is going to be the clash of civilizations, so let's talk about where that goes, but first
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:43.560]  off I saw a trailer for the new Handmaiden's Tale that's the leftist book about a right-wing
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.680]  dictatorship where they have women as concubines and sex slavery and make them wear hoods over
[1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:49.680]  their heads.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:54.480]  It's basically projecting onto Christianity what Orthodox Islam's doing.
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:59.320]  I saw the new ad for this and it looks like the police state that the left's actually
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:08.160]  trying to set up, and then separately I also see other movies and other things that are
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:16.200]  coming out where they project onto us what in reality, and I know you're not even really
[1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:22.480]  a Christian, but they project onto Western civilization the things that they themselves
[1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:27.040]  are actually wanting to do, and then they have movies like The Purge where one night
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:32.880]  out of the year you can go around and kill whoever you want, but at the same time Ramadan's
[1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:36.400]  like a month or more where you can go around and murder everybody or under Islam, kill
[1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:40.480]  people that aren't Muslims whenever you want anyway, so everything they're projecting onto
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.280]  right-wing America or even Americana, which is classical liberalism, is what leftism
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:50.720]  actually is supporting in Islam, I mean it's total inversion of reality.
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:55.880]  Exactly, and again it comes down to the fact they don't disavow their extremists, most
[1:16:55.880 --> 1:17:01.280]  people don't know, there's a guy called Michael Sanford who a year ago tried to actually assassinate
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:06.560]  Trump at a rally, tried to grab an officer's gun and kill him, how did the left respond
[1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:07.560]  to that?
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:12.160]  They actually made a documentary, the BBC, it was basically a puff piece saying oh he
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:18.280]  was just this misunderstood young man, literally tried to gun down Trump in cold blood, that's
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:25.320]  just one example of many, they always lionize and justify violent extremism time after time
[1:17:25.320 --> 1:17:31.080]  Oh, blame it on Western foreign policy, that's the real cause, that justifies it, well no,
[1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:35.240]  90% of terrorism victims are other Muslims because they're killing each other.
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:40.040]  Well sure, but I mean take last week, with the congressman, Wolf Blitzer had a guest
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:44.240]  on saying this guy wasn't evil, he was just upset and Wolf Blitzer didn't even disagree
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:49.200]  with him and justified it, I mean these people are openly trying to prosecute terror and
[1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:53.880]  violence against us and are pushing people to do it, at what point we haven't attacked
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:59.160]  offensively, at what point does defense become offense and these people start getting gunned
[1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:02.160]  down, I mean I don't want that to happen, but if they're pushing violence it's going
[1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:04.280]  to start.
[1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:08.840]  Well there'll probably be hate mobs of leftists that actually try to lynch people, they'll
[1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:13.720]  probably go after Tommy Robinson, I mean you've got all the same leftists who say absolutely
[1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:18.440]  nothing in response to every Islamic terror attack, literally calling for Tommy Robinson
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:23.840]  to be targeted as a hate preacher, okay, the difference is Tommy Robinson doesn't get
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:29.240]  up to 10 years in a mosque and celebrate ISIS terror attacks, he doesn't go and tell people
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:35.160]  to go and carry out violent attacks against anyone, we're calling for solutions that will
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.880]  end terrorism across the board and for that we're labelled hate preachers, they're saying
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:44.600]  oh, just like we go after the Islamic hate preachers, we need to go after Tommy Robinson,
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:49.040]  they don't go after Islamic hate preachers in the UK, they're allowed to preach in mosques
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:53.880]  for 10 years or more without being arrested, they're given platforms on television.
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:57.040]  Exactly, we should get Tommy Robinson on, he's never done anything violent, he's done
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:18:59.960]  nothing wrong, one more segment with Paul Watson, then I'm going to take your phone
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:04.760]  calls to cover other news, but since we mentioned it, here's Wolf Blitzer last week, the day
[1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:09.280]  of the attack, the day of the attack and some of the other shows are condoning it, Huffington
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:13.840]  Post has writers saying too bad it's not more organized, too bad it's not bigger, here they
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:16.200]  are pushing this narrative.
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:36.680]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil, that he was, I guess, tired of some
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:38.720]  of the politics that are going on.
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:44.040]  That's what we just heard, perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics that's going
[1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:45.040]  on.
[1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:49.120]  When they say I'm so evil, don't let me on air, then misrepresent what I've said, and
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:53.560]  then meanwhile they just have this on, I mean these people, they're looking for a war, I
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:57.840]  want to ask Paul, what does he think they're going to do next, how does he think it's going
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:00.280]  for the globalist versus the nationalist?
[1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:04.860]  Diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety meds, everyone's on them.
[1:20:04.860 --> 1:20:08.760]  If you're a 50 year old male, maybe a bit porky and you may even have type 2 diabetes,
[1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:14.400]  a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about 200 bucks a month, called term

[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:49.320]  Bacon, fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm
[1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:50.320]  and served.

[1:23:54.200 --> 1:24:01.200]  Ships free at fullycookedbacon.com, fullycookedbacon.com.
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:34.360]  So, let me ask Paul Watson his question.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:35.360]  Why is he calling this?
[1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:36.920]  I'm not disagreeing with him.
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:40.960]  A right-wing terror attack in London, I guess just to be fair because the left always makes
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:43.800]  excuses for all the countless Islamic attacks that happen.
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:48.680]  So somebody gets tired and strikes back, even though it's like, you know, one-one-thousandthes
[1:24:48.680 --> 1:24:53.600]  just of what the Islamists have done during Ramadan, thousands of dead.
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.640]  But why call it a right-wing terror attack?
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:59.040]  Because I don't think we really know yet, I mean, we have some videos, we have some
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:04.600]  supposed Muslim witnesses, UK police investigating Van attack in London as terrorism.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:07.920]  So the New York Times is saying, investigate his terrorism.
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:11.120]  Paul, why are you saying it's a right-wing terror attack?
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:17.400]  Well, I think it's important to be intellectually consistent and not deny violent extremism,
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:20.200]  which is what the left does after every single terror attack.
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:23.440]  So we know, Alex, that there are violent right-wing extremists.
[1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:29.280]  As sporadic, like you said, this unfortunately is tragic, it's outrageous.
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:34.080]  Fortunately only one person died, unlike Manchester, where 10 children had their arms and legs
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:38.960]  blown off, unlike Nice, where 84 people died and 400 plus were injured.
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:41.840]  So it's dishonest to say there's a comparable threat.
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:47.200]  But again, it's important to say that it is right-wing extremism because extremism causes
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:48.200]  more extremism.
[1:25:48.200 --> 1:25:52.520]  And if you don't offer solutions, and if you shout down the people who are trying to
[1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:57.720]  offer solutions, then it's only going to cause a backlash by other extremists, and that's
[1:25:57.720 --> 1:25:58.720]  what we see happening.
[1:25:58.720 --> 1:26:01.760]  And that's what you were getting into before, Alex.
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:06.880]  I think as I predicted before the attempted massacre, and let's call it what it was, it
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.560]  was an attempted massacre of Republican lawmakers, thankfully stopped.
[1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:16.520]  I predicted that saying a social justice warrior would go postal and kill a lot of people.
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:19.080]  Fortunately, it didn't happen on that occasion.
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:20.080]  That's what's going to happen.
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:24.360]  There are going to be massacres by social justice warriors, and then we'll get blamed
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:25.360]  for it.
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:29.040]  There's a huge riot probably going to happen on July the 2nd, where they have these nationwide
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:31.840]  anti-Trump impeachment marches.
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:34.320]  Almost certainly there'll be violence during those.
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:41.600]  So it's all coming to a boiling point in this summer of rage that we now find ourselves in.
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:43.320]  What's the larger master plan?
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:46.520]  Soros is one of the main funders, other globalist groups.
[1:26:46.520 --> 1:26:50.320]  The left, though, on Hollywood, TV, everywhere, I mean, they want war.
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:52.880]  How do you see this ending?
[1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:53.880]  Not good.
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:59.720]  I mean, you saw the guy in Alexandria, he couldn't shoot straight, basically.
[1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:03.960]  It was prevented from being a massacre by the fact that there were good guys with guns
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:06.920]  and the fact that he was useless at shooting.
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:10.160]  So there are, what, 70 million armed American gun owners.
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:13.640]  If they want to get into a shooting war, it's not going to go well for them.
[1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:15.840]  But again, they're the ones pushing that.
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:19.760]  You had the Punchinazzi narrative, Alex, for months and months that it was acceptable to
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:24.720]  physically violently attack people because you disagree with them politically.
[1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:31.280]  You had people up on stage at awards shows shouting Punchinazzi, leftist directors, okay?
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:35.840]  Any violence that happens, they're responsible for it because they didn't disavow it.
[1:27:35.840 --> 1:27:36.960]  They encouraged it.
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.400]  They legitimized it.
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.920]  So no, you don't have the moral high ground when you point your finger at us, a lecture
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:48.960]  us about extremism and violence, when you're the ones who, you know, curated it for months
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:52.920]  and months beforehand, now it's happening on a more regular basis.
[1:27:52.920 --> 1:27:57.240]  The left is firmly to blame for that.
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:01.920]  That's why Ted Nugent has never been for offensive violence, but he said if they, you know, go
[1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:05.160]  after us, we have a right to fight back against them.
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:09.160]  He's saying everybody's a disavow violence right now because that's what the globalist
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:10.160]  want.
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:16.160]  We just have a civil war, but it's the whole argument which is going on between more establishment
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:21.000]  conservatives and the alt-right or the alt-right, whatever you want to call them.
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:27.080]  Do we actually embrace the tactics of the left, the tactics of Saul Alinsky and use
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:32.360]  the left's own tactics against them, which you saw in the aftermath of the Trump assassination
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  play.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:39.360]  Again, this, this outrage mob mentality that now targets the left calls for people to boycott
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:44.280]  them, calls for people on CNN celebrating that play to be fired.
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:48.200]  So you have this strange scenario, and this is a huge debate going on within the conservative
[1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:49.200]  movement.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:53.720]  Do we take on the tactics of the left, which let's be honest, have been quite successful
[1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:56.960]  in prior years, use them against them?
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:29:01.000]  Like Saul Alinsky said, I want to be clear, I want to be clear, I don't want to offensively
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  be violent, but I do think people should take over these violent plays.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.320]  They should get in their faces.
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:11.640]  We should hijack the media when it's legal.
[1:29:11.640 --> 1:29:13.400]  No, exactly.
[1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:17.400]  I mean, there are certain ways you can do it without being a hypocrite, but again, that's
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:22.000]  the big debate that's going on because for decades and decades, conservatives have just
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:27.240]  remained pretty much mute, and they've lost, lost, lost over and over again, especially
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:29.840]  in terms of the culture war and politically.
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:34.960]  So that's why that debate is happening now, because it's having some success by embracing
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:35.960]  those kinds of tactics.
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:39.040]  And the left doesn't see how hypocritical they are.
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.920]  I mean, I never even thought of myself as right wing.
[1:29:40.920 --> 1:29:45.120]  I'm just a libertarian, but the left are crazed.
[1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.280]  Thank you, Paul Watson.
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:48.360]  Your phone calls and breaking news straight ahead.
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:49.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:50.360]  Stay with us.
[1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:51.600]  We're on the March.
[1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:54.080]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.080 --> 1:29:57.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:57.480 --> 1:30:03.720]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine.
[1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:07.560]  On Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York public disgrace theater
[1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:11.840]  showing of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination
[1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:12.840]  of President Trump.
[1:30:12.840 --> 1:30:17.360]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands,
[1:30:17.360 --> 1:30:22.120]  as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:26.480]  While she was being arrested, Jack Pasobic went live on Twitter to broadcast the event
[1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:30.760]  and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that Joseph Goebbels
[1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:34.080]  would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis.
[1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:37.880]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the
[1:30:37.880 --> 1:30:40.600]  Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:45.200]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be
[1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:47.360]  proud, CNN is ISIS.
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:51.520]  While the protesters were all arrested, rumor has it some of the police involved support
[1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:55.680]  the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York
[1:30:55.680 --> 1:30:57.840]  public theater against our president.
[1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:00.920]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:33.120]  it is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,

[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:07.160]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:08.960]  Great, hey, thank you so much.

[1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:22.560]  Swell, Plainman Interfusion, I've got the body armor.
[1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:23.560]  Wow, thank you.
[1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:26.040]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:27.720]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[1:32:27.720 --> 1:32:31.400]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:32.400]  That's amazing.
[1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:36.480]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:37.480]  sweet.
[1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:43.280]  My morning was fantastic, and I love the guys, I love the InfowarsTrue, and I just want to,
[1:32:43.280 --> 1:32:47.640]  yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence,
[1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:49.800]  just buy it, you will love it.
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:52.120]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:56.280]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:32:56.280 --> 1:33:24.360]  It's a win-win at InfowarsLife.com.
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:44.240]  From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, we're here live, thank you for joining us.
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:49.200]  Coming up today, we're going to have Mike Cernovich popping back in.
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:50.200]  He's here.
[1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:51.200]  Joe Biggs is going to be in studio.
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:53.080]  I want to open the phones up and take your calls.
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:55.840]  David Knight's coming up, hosting the fourth hour.
[1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:03.920]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-2599-231.
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:13.120]  Personally, I thought that it was pretty anticlimactic what happened last night, because there wasn't
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:14.480]  any gotcha moment with her.
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:20.080]  It was just every lie, every spun piece of garbage, every piece of disinfo, and then
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:25.720]  she had the lowest rating she's ever had, showing that people were totally sick of her.
[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:32.400]  If you would have promoted drying paint the way they did, you would have had more than
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:33.960]  three and a half million viewers.
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:40.040]  I mean, that is a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy thing in the final equation to think about.
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:41.520]  But that's not why we're opening the phones up.
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:46.280]  You're welcome to call in about Megan Kelly and what you thought last night, but the big
[1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:51.680]  issue's obviously Russia and the fact that Obama created a total disaster in the Middle
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:57.160]  East along with NATO and the EU, turning over many, many nations to horrible jihadists.
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:03.240]  Syria has been fighting against it, and now our military has been defeating ISIS and mopping
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:10.600]  them up, so now more and more they're turning towards, it looks like, removing Assad.
[1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:14.640]  And to try to trick Trump into that conflict, they have shot down an aircraft, they have
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:20.640]  blown up a armored column of armored vehicles, and this has been going on for months.
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:26.800]  There's been other incidences as well, and now Russia is saying, okay, well, we're entering
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:32.680]  war territory, so if any U.S. aircraft enter the airspace or any other flying objects,
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:36.720]  cruise missiles, you name it, we're going to shoot them down because we let you blow up
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:42.000]  the chemical dump, we let you bomb the armored column, now you've shot down the airplane.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  This is clearly a test.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:46.600]  I mean, if Trump wanted to do it, he'd tell the Russians, I'm coming in, back off, get
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.400]  ready, try to make some deal or go ahead and do it.
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:53.520]  He wouldn't be probing like this.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:57.560]  And I've got it from White House sources, multiple sources, very high up, that Trump
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:01.080]  understands there's people trying to get him into a larger war, and he's been saying no.
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:05.720]  And that goes back to this article by Paul Watson on April 10th, the day after I talked
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:09.040]  to a high-level White House source, White House source, Trump pushes back against a
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.760]  neocon plan to invade Syria, trips to massing his deep state plots, regime change.
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:20.040]  Three days later, Bloomberg and others all reported word for word what we got from our
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:26.360]  source who talked to the president, and I'll just leave it at that.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:32.280]  So again, you can see our story is April 10th, and then, look, Bloomberg, April 13th, this
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:35.880]  is what I wigged out about earlier, and a lot of that is pent up anxiety about the
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:38.680]  interview yesterday and all the energy and things that are going on.
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:42.800]  That's not an act when I occasionally maybe once a month freak out on air, and I've got
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:43.800]  to have a headline.
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:45.520]  It's not that I'm even mad at the crew.
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:49.400]  I started obsessing over it and wanting to remember it, and knowing I did the interview
[1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:54.880]  and knowing I talked to the sources and knowing we wrote the article, and then I'm just here
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:58.760]  gibbering on air asking for what I want, and there's so many thousands of articles they
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:36:59.760]  can't find it.
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:04.560]  So, you know, say a prayer for the crew occasionally, it's putting up and they can be obnoxious.
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:12.680]  But seriously, Megan Kelly asked me, are you an actor, because in court documents they
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:17.040]  said that you're playing an actor, or something fake.
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:21.840]  I mean, I'm here giving you sources that the president said, no boots on the ground, we're
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:27.480]  taking ISIS out, we're not going to remove Assad, and then three days later, exactly
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:33.840]  what we said is in the news, that's not acting, that's real, or when I get mad and basically
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:39.960]  I'm not obsessive compulsive about the bed being perfectly made, or food being right
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:44.480]  in the refrigerator, or my toothpaste, you know, being upright in its stand, I have a
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:47.880]  lot of friends and family that are kind of OCD, a lot of them are nice people, but they're
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:52.400]  real neat freaks, or I've got to have the yard mowed perfectly, or you know, whatever.
[1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:58.360]  I'm not that type of guy, I'm not a neat freak, but I have developed this frustration because
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:02.720]  I know all this knowledge and I know I'm right, and then when I can't find it or pull it
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:04.700]  right up, I go crazy.
[1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:10.200]  Then what frustrates me on the other side is Megan Kelly, the biggest lie of the night
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:14.040]  was her saying that it wasn't a hit piece when we all knew it was, and then we showed
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:18.800]  you the tape, we played the audio so you could see she was a liar, and then everything else
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:25.600]  that flowed from it was a lie, but the big factual lie wasn't just all the trick editing,
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:31.160]  it was her playing a clip with Joe Biggs, our full-time reporter at the time, he does
[1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:35.040]  reporting work for us now, but also does his own stuff, and that's great.
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:37.280]  He's coming to the studio later.
[1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:43.920]  Down there with our camera people, catching, this was Josh Owens and others, catching people
[1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:48.400]  with drugs coming across the border, and it's clearly marijuana, that's what they ship
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:52.160]  in the 55-pound containers, and they put it in the back of the vehicle and then run back
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:57.040]  across, and they just smuggled something, which is 99% drugs, probably marijuana, the
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:01.920]  police told us marijuana, FBI said marijuana, Biggs met with the FBI after this occasion
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:05.080]  and other occasions, they told him he had a lot of courage, and our camera people had
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:09.880]  a lot of courage, and we did a great job, and then we went into the most dangerous area
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:14.280]  over the Texas border and went and showed a known ISIS facility, it was later confirmed
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:18.720]  to be an ISIS facility, by government documents, the judicial watch got, and she just said,
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:23.320]  no, we're liars, so I want to play that clip and just illustrate that because Joe's coming
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:29.880]  into the studio a little bit later, here's a clip from Megan Kelly last night where she
[1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:33.920]  shows it and says, this is an example of how we're not journalists because we said it was
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:40.360]  drugs and then Trump said it was drugs, well that's like saying if a blue jay lands in
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:45.200]  the tree in my yard, and I'm looking at it out the window and I take a picture of it,
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:51.360]  and I put it on Facebook and say, look, I took a picture of a blue jay, and then, you
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:55.400]  know, CNN does a story saying you're on an ornithologist, you don't know that's a blue
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:40:03.800]  jay, no, if I see a red and silver 57 Chevy, I know a 57 Chevy, I don't have a degree,
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:12.680]  you know, in automotive history, but I know a 57 Chevy when I see one, and I can post
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:17.440]  a picture of it and I can say it's a 57 Chevy, you know, it's the same thing, we go down
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:21.960]  to the border, we get tipped off by the state police and border patrol, we go show it to
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:26.720]  you, it's embarrassing for the government, Obama with the border open, it's now clamped
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:31.120]  down to a great extent by Trump, they're embarrassed, what do they do?
[1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:35.600]  They just say it's fake, they got clips of Comey saying that Trump never tried to influence
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:39.960]  him, never called for obstruction, just say it's obstruction, you know, just say the tape
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:45.080]  doesn't exist, just say we're liars, and have the New York Times do it and try to use its
[1:40:45.080 --> 1:40:53.920]  credibility, it doesn't have credibility, NBC doesn't have credibility, CNN doesn't
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:58.680]  have credibility, you have zero, you have less than zero, you're known liars, does it
[1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:04.760]  mean if you sandwich a pro marijuana piece in, with a piece about New Zealand and how
[1:41:04.760 --> 1:41:10.960]  beautiful it is, that by mixing, you know, some nebulous stuff in, does it make the lie
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:16.760]  that it's sandwiched between seem okay, and the answer is no, everything Megan Kelly said
[1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:21.200]  was a lie, and I'm sick of Megan Kelly, you're sick of Megan Kelly, but we have to illustrate
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.360]  how they lie, we can't just go, oh, we know you're liars and move on, we've got to continue
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:31.120]  to show how they're liars and hammer it in because they're so close, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:36.680]  to being completely discredited and collapsing, here's the clip from Megan Kelly last night.
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:41.480]  I mean, I know Trump watches and sees the clips and things. We did find indications
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:48.200]  of that on July 22nd, 2015, info wars put up this video, claiming it showed drug trafficking
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:54.720]  along the US-Mexico border, although we don't know what it actually shows. We actually witnessed
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:42:01.160]  a drug smuggling operation from Mexico into the US. Three days later, Mr. Trump gave
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:17.880]  this speech in Iowa. And then she goes on to say, look how Trump just lied to you.
[1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:21.520]  I mean, no, he didn't. That's one of the biggest drug corridors in the world. It's people
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:28.720]  illegally coming across with big cases of marijuana. That's how they ship it. You think
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:33.520]  people are going to risk their lives and risk going to prison to smuggle bananas across
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:39.240]  or smuggle Easter bunnies across or Keebler elves or maybe it was Santa's elves and
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:44.240]  Santa now months before Christmas, he flies over in a big plane and little, little elves
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:50.200]  jump out like pear trippers. And then they drift down to earth and then they build the
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:57.320]  toys in the bushes by the Rio Grande. And then they come across and then they get in
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:00.480]  a vehicle. They love, you know, they love the goods of the vehicle. Then the elves run
[1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:05.120]  back into the bushes and then the car speeds away. I mean, that was really what happened.
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:10.160]  That's a conspiracy theory. In a drug corridor, in the packaging, we know the marijuana is
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:14.520]  packaged in people clearly running it across to put it in a vehicle to be carried down
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:21.960]  the highway. I mean, you'd have to be a moron not to know what that was, but I'm digressing.
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:25.400]  I get frustrated by Megan Kelly. I get frustrated by her lies. And I'm just sick of hearing
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:30.200]  it. I know most of you just tune out of it because you're tired of her, but we've got
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:40.920]  to continue to hammer these liars. 800-25-99231-800-25-99231 on the Russia situation, on all of it.
[1:43:40.920 --> 1:43:45.040]  Speaking of Russia, Adam Schiff admits there's no proof of Trump-Russia collusion. He keeps
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:55.000]  saying this. He keeps saying this. It's a CYA. But then, he's saying it doesn't matter.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:02.080]  We have obstruction, so let's go into obstruction. I want to play a clip of Schiff. Adam Schiff
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:06.000]  admits there's no proof of Trump and Russia. Here it is.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.080]  I know you can't talk about specific evidence, but he says, Diane Feinstein has said there's
[1:44:11.080 --> 1:44:16.200]  no evidence of collusion. So, collusion between whom? Can you tell us that?
[1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:21.960]  Well, the allegation, of course, is that the Russians in the hacking and dumping of documents
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:29.240]  in the election had essentially relationships with Trump campaign people and coordinated
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:34.760]  those efforts. Now, the FBI opened an investigation into that issue in July, well before Congress
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:39.800]  did. I think they did that for good reason in July. I think they maintained that investigation.
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:44.400]  That's ongoing for good reason as well. But I'm not prepared to say that there's proof
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:49.680]  you could take to a jury, but I can't say that there is enough that we ought to be investigating.
[1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:50.680]  Indeed, it would be...
[1:44:50.680 --> 1:44:57.920]  Yeah, like the uranium that Hillary and Podesta sold for $37 million or her meeting with Putin
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:02.800]  in secret. This is all insane, but they just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to change
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:08.000]  the subject that they lost the election and that we were right about the polls being fake.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.080]  And we were right and we broke so much of the news. That's why they've got to have dateline
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:17.280]  NBC with these hit pieces saying, I'm not credible and I'm a fraud. And all the rest
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:23.320]  of it is because they want to get to you. They want to demoralize you. They want to
[1:45:23.320 --> 1:45:27.880]  make you feel hopeless. They want to make you think you're powerless. Instead of keeping
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:32.320]  your head up and realizing we've already had such huge victories, thank God we've got a
[1:45:32.320 --> 1:45:36.760]  decent Supreme Court justice in. Thank heavens we've got some good things happening and some
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:40.840]  of the economy coming back and a 40 plus percent reduction of illegals coming across
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:46.440]  the border and NAFTA and GATT being renegotiated and the TPP being withdrawn from and the carbon
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:51.280]  tax of the Paris Accord were out of and all the good things. That's why I'm so behind
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:57.200]  Trump is because I know the globalist hate him because they hate America and he's trying
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:02.200]  the best he can. Trump told my sources that he wasn't going to let him launch a water
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:07.440]  war, but they were trying to and they're still trying, but he's doing good with our military
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:13.040]  taking out ISIS. This is a very exciting time to be alive. The globalists are panicking
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:19.120]  briefly and then I'm going to John and Zach and Dave and Frank and Alan others. I want
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:25.160]  to hire and we're hiring some more producers and other folks to run live shows. We've just
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:29.960]  got amazing new lady we've hired. I'm trying to hire another 10 or 15 people just to run
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:34.000]  all these shows. I'm going to launch the morning, the afternoon and at night. So there's other
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:39.880]  hosts and other guests and more callers and more time to really continue to affect the
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:44.280]  news cycle on Twitter, Facebook and Google because the stories we're putting out in our
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:51.560]  reports and our analysis is really having a big effect and I want to go to the next level
[1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:56.440]  in the face of their onslaught, but that takes your financial support. It takes your prayers
[1:46:56.440 --> 1:47:00.720]  and it takes you spreading the articles and videos and info wars.com to everybody you
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:04.920]  know continually and not just saying, Hey, I already know all this. You know, I'm glad
[1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:10.360]  Alex is there. I'm glad other people are there. We've got to continue to hammer the globalists
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:13.800]  because if they're able to overthrow Trump, they're going to move against the independent
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:17.720]  media. They've said they're doing this and then the sky's the limit for the things the
[1:47:17.720 --> 1:47:21.200]  globalists are going to do. We're going to be right back where we were in Obama's last
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:28.400]  six months when the country was absolutely collapsing. So again, I'm running more and

[1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:10.920]  near. Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:15.720]  and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:20.680]  and city shutdowns and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long term
[1:51:20.680 --> 1:51:25.520]  outages from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:30.080]  the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's why

[1:54:10.400 --> 1:54:14.200]  You know, folks, just because we haven't had a nuclear war since the United States dropped
[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:18.560]  atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, doesn't mean it's not going to happen. In fact, most
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:23.960]  historians, most military analysts believe the longer we go still having the weapons
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:30.760]  on ships, on airplanes, in submarines, in silos, the longer this continues, the more
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:36.320]  there's a chance we're going to end up having something go wrong. When I say that particularly,
[1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:43.000]  not just because of accidents, but because people stop worrying about them. They start
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:48.440]  taking it for granted that we're always going to have peace and we won't destroy ourselves.
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:54.320]  And then the Pentagon starts thinking maybe we can use nukes in limited strikes. So we
[1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:58.080]  have to respect these weapons. We have to respect the bio weapons and the chemical weapons
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:03.440]  and all the things that are happening because Russia is saying you fly an airplane over
[1:55:03.440 --> 1:55:06.720]  serious space, we're going to shoot it down. That means they intend to do it. And then
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:11.280]  if we retaliate, then the Russians retaliate and within a matter of an hour, most analysts
[1:55:11.280 --> 1:55:17.200]  believe it could lead to tactical nuclear weapons being used. And again, Trump isn't
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:21.520]  trying to do this. He's been very clear. But there are people inside the deep state that
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:25.760]  are undermining him at every level, not just the State Department, not just the CIA, but
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:30.680]  in the military. John in Texas, what do you think about what's happening?
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:37.280]  Hi, Alex. First off, before I start, I want to recommend a great movie. It just came out.
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.280]  I've seen it at the movies called Bitter Harvest. I don't know if you heard of it or not.
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:43.800]  No, I haven't. What's it about?
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:47.680]  What's it about? The Ukrainian massacre, the Communist massacres of the Ukrainians during
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:55.640]  the 1930s. Really a great movie, really. You know, not too many Hollywood movies I'd ever
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:58.440]  recommend with that. You know, folks that complain that they had
[1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:04.600]  not an Armenian massacre or Ukrainian extermination movies. And so I'm glad that the one about
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:10.760]  the folks in Turkey came out. And so I've heard about Bitter Harvest. I need to see
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:15.720]  that. Walmart. They're in Walmart right now, so you
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:21.560]  can pick a copy up there. Great movie. Okay, what I want to talk about is a couple weeks
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:28.600]  ago I was going through some of the militia websites, you know, and they said that what
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:32.280]  I got out of reading them is that they said they were trying to form a new continental
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:38.720]  army and that when the deep state starts their war with Russia, that they plan on asking
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:42.160]  Vladimir Putin for air cover and heavy weapons, and then they'll mark John Washington.
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:45.720]  Oh, that is total. I guarantee you that's feds. And they're saying they can create that
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:49.720]  narrative later and claim any American resistance is directed by the Russians.
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:54.320]  Well, I hope so, I mean, I hope so.
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:00.200]  Oh, of course. I mean, that's central scripting. The Russians can't even run their own country.
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:05.600]  They're not going to be coordinating anything here. It's the left. It came out in FBI documents
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:10.400]  that wanted to invite the Cubans and a bunch of Latin American communist states in and
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:16.480]  then Chinese on the West Coast. And that still is tenuous and somewhat delusional. But the
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:23.640]  idea that Russians are going to come over here and runs things is again, I'm not against
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:29.240]  the militias, the feds inside the militias always misrepresent what I say and go, he's
[1:57:29.240 --> 1:57:34.440]  anti militia, man. Then the guy goes in and gets his orders from the FBI. They'll have
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:38.120]  people go out create militias, have them do unconstitutional things so they can then
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:42.280]  demonize the idea of an armed citizenry. They've had a project since the 80s. That's
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:47.360]  what it is. I don't know about the group you're talking about particularly. I just know the
[1:57:47.360 --> 1:57:53.360]  idea of asking Putin to come over here with air cover is a ridiculous and be meant to
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:58.720]  demonize any resistance movement. If this goes to a hot war, they're going to claim
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:00.720]  that they're Russian agents.
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:08.040]  I got another quick question for you. Yeah, go ahead. Okay. Donald Trump, some strong
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:15.200]  supporter Israel, his friends with Benjamin Martin, Netanyahu and his fellow Jewish. Why
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:20.480]  are so many Jews in Hollywood and in the media and in, uh, in, uh, they're trying to bring
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:26.480]  them down because they're leftist and then that's where leftists are unified, no matter
[1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:30.280]  where they come from, whether they're communist, Chinese or Jewish or whatever is that they
[1:58:30.280 --> 1:58:34.640]  hate Christianity, they hate freedom and they want to have a socialized command and control
[1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:39.240]  system. Uh, just like left wing Jews want to kill the right wing Jews. And it's the
[1:58:39.240 --> 1:58:43.600]  same thing. It's all a left wing, right wing issue, which itself is a controlled paradigm.
[1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:48.600]  Those are really good questions, John. I appreciate your call. You know, we should talk about what
[1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:53.040]  a civil war will look like because they may have one. Men, give your body the support

[1:59:53.840 --> 2:00:16.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war. It's
[2:00:16.680 --> 2:00:29.680]  Alex Jones. If you just joined us, a caller called in and talked about going around on
[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:35.960]  militia websites, you know, I could start a website and claim that I was a Chinese jet
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:42.160]  pilot from Pluto. All right, sort of website and claim that I was a militia, this militia
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:46.800]  that I believe in the militia. It's in the second amendment. It's an armed citizenry
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:52.000]  called out by your local government or your local leadership. If the country's invaded
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:57.040]  or if the federal government falls to an outside hostile force. And you've got the states and
[2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:01.460]  counties and cities organizing against globalism right now. You've got countries organizing
[2:01:01.460 --> 2:01:06.040]  against it and our movement is popular. The globalists are going to try to brand it as
[2:01:06.040 --> 2:01:14.520]  extreme racist or basically outsider. It's been the left historically wanting to bring
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:18.800]  down the country and then bring in a multinational force from communists and socialist nations
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:23.280]  to suppress us. Loretta Lynch tried to do that just about a year ago with the strong
[2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:28.600]  cities initiative to bring in the UN to actually have them oversee the police. So they're
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:34.220]  trying to cause a civil war or civil unrest. Then if things break down and get really bad,
[2:01:34.220 --> 2:01:38.000]  they have now said in Atlantic monthly, they're going to overthrow Trump claiming he's a Russian
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.480]  agent. Then all of the new Republicans that are elected, they'll claim were elected by
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:48.520]  Russian influence as well. If they go along with the purge, maybe they can stay in office.
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:52.160]  The Democrats will then have new elections run by Homeland Security. We'll never have
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:57.840]  another real election again. They will then claim everyone resisting this takeover is
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:02:03.240]  a Russian agent. So of course they're going to have the websites and the groups and the
[2:02:03.240 --> 2:02:07.040]  organizations. That's a false flag. Just like Trump knew when the Jewish centers were
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:12.360]  being attacked, he said it's probably a false flag. Turned out it was a false flag because
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:18.840]  99%, I mean, every once in a while you see a real racial attack or a cross burning or
[2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:24.280]  somebody painting swastikas in a dorm. But 99% of the time it's somebody wanting attention.
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:28.000]  Most of the time you hear the story of, you know, a white woman, four black guys raped
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:32.360]  her behind the 7-11. And then it turns out that's fake too. A lot of this stuff is done
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:39.760]  to get attention. And the police know that. So, strangest thing, a lot of times they find
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.440]  pipe bombs in towns and that it's usually a cop or a firefighter. And I'm not saying
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:47.280]  cops and firefighters on average are doing that. It's just psychologically there's that
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:53.280]  very low percentile that still is the majority of the actual events that are normally rare.
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:58.840]  That's just criminology. And so without even seeing these sites, I had already envisioned
[2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:02.520]  and then I saw the preparation and I've seen them announce it. Now you could argue they're
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:05.360]  listening to me in government and going, oh, that's a great plan. Let's do it. But that's
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:08.720]  not what they're doing. I've studied history. I know who their tacticians are. I know their
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:13.080]  plans. And that's why I've said they're going to try to kill the president, overthrow the
[2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:17.560]  president, whatever they can, cause a civil war, be violent, blame it on us, and then
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:25.440]  claim if we resist them, we're with Putin. And so yes, of course, that's what we've been
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:30.880]  hearing that if there's a civil war, there'll be Russian air cover. That's not how the military
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:35.360]  works to begin with. It's whoever gets control of the National Security Council and the launch
[2:03:35.360 --> 2:03:39.520]  codes and the nuclear weapons and then whoever gives orders to the submarines and ships and
[2:03:39.520 --> 2:03:49.280]  do they follow those orders? It's not like we're in a civil war, the Russians come over
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:56.320]  and help us and all this stuff. It's whoever's got control of space command and the weapons
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:01.240]  platforms in space, not just satellites, but whole, whole platforms up there with Shabo
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:07.040]  meteor guns with DU projectiles and hydrogen bombs and neutron bombs and just, and by the
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:12.000]  way, I think it's insane. They put all this up in orbit, but we're like 30 years ahead
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:16.800]  of everybody else. And it's just, it's all up there. They assemble them in pieces. They
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:23.240]  claim that's how it's safer. They send them up in pieces and they assemble them up there.
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:27.920]  And it's just completely insane. It's a miracle or even alive. You know, I'm thinking about
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:32.200]  not being political anymore, just because I've already done that so much and just covering
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:37.920]  genetic engineering, electromagnetic stuff, the chimeras, you know, just all the weapons
[2:04:37.920 --> 2:04:42.000]  systems and just how most people I've talked to don't even talk. They just look at their
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:45.840]  phone all day. Hell, most talk show host came and host shows anymore. They just sit there,
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:50.120]  look at their phones and just, I mean, I'm not making this meanly, but a lot of people
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:53.600]  I know personally can't even host a talk show because they, they just can't miss out their
[2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:57.920]  phones. They all have family members now. They're just gone. They just face sucker, boom, you
[2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:04.880]  know, lost in the constant fake news cycle. We have forgotten the building tensions in
[2:05:04.880 --> 2:05:09.880]  Syria until this morning when news broke of a Syrian army plane being shot down by a United
[2:05:09.880 --> 2:05:14.640]  States F 18. This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been down by the United States since
[2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:20.040]  2011. Washington justified the strike claiming the jet drop bombs near US back forces while
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:24.720]  officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS. Truth be told, these are most likely
[2:05:24.720 --> 2:05:29.640]  the same group, but we should be asking John McCain that question. Russia has responded
[2:05:29.640 --> 2:05:35.040]  by saying it will now treat US aircraft operating in Syria as targets. President Trump can't
[2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:39.840]  get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation to be over.
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:44.120]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.

[2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:35.280]  I'm going right to Zach, Dave, Frank, Al and others and then Joe Biggs is scheduled to
[2:08:35.280 --> 2:08:39.480]  be here. They can Kelly attacked him and said it was totally fake. You know, we didn't catch
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:44.360]  drugs coming across the border. It's just emblematic of her whole piece what a fraud
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:49.640]  she is. But now they've got the Washington Post and others after saying they didn't want
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.880]  the interview to air that didn't even matter and use that as a backdrop to demonize me
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:59.120]  and say I was the most evil person in the world. Now their new thing is Megan Kelly
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:04.680]  just helped some guy get thousands of new followers. Oh, she helped me. Yeah, MSM, you're
[2:09:04.680 --> 2:09:10.720]  the you're the power structure. She's the princess. I'm the toad. They can't even create
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:17.800]  their own analogy. That's mine. I made fun of myself. And then meanwhile they show how
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:25.320]  we got boosted traffic. Well, yeah, this is usually a slow time of the year. And we got
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:29.560]  a lot more traffic. So what I told everybody, this is usually one of the slowest times of
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:34.880]  the year. This end of the first two weeks of August is the slowest time of the year.
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:39.280]  People are going on summer vacation. The summer is really kicking in. Our people are going
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:43.760]  back to school. But no, I told everybody I didn't show the analytics. I said we've got
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:49.680]  the highest ratings we've had since the election. But it wasn't from her show. It was from
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:57.080]  them making a huge controversy to try to get her viewers for flagging NBC. She came in
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:04.200]  and had 6 million, 6 and a half million. Then she had 5 million. And now she has 3.5 million.
[2:10:04.200 --> 2:10:10.840]  Now part of that is the summer. But I looked it up a decade ago, they had like 15 million
[2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:18.880]  viewers for an average day on NBC. They're tuning out of you. I don't need you, may gun.
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:25.840]  Our videos in the last week about you had 20 plus million views.
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:30.120]  Ours had over 15 million. Cernovich's had a bunch. 22 million. That's just counting a
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:34.280]  few activist videos. I don't have a lot of time. I went and got on YouTube, counted them
[2:10:34.280 --> 2:10:39.920]  up this morning. Saw Cernovich's yesterday because I want to see how ours compared. He
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:47.680]  had like 8, 9 million. We had 15 million. That's 20. I said 22 million. That's 24 million,
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:53.000]  25 million. So it didn't matter what they did. She's a joke. That's the story. And
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:59.200]  now they've got articles saying don't say my name. MSM has been not saying my name as
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:07.880]  a rule until about 3 years ago. And now they're back to saying we will not say his name. A
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:15.520]  little too late there, guys. A little too late. There's the headline. Megan Kelly just
[2:11:15.520 --> 2:11:20.960]  helped some guy get thousands of new followers. Megan Kelly just helped some guy. NBC News
[2:11:20.960 --> 2:11:24.840]  host Megan Kelly boosted the social media profile. Well, I've never been good on social
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:31.240]  media. We have our own syndicated system, our own network, but I mean we reach millions
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:38.240]  there, but I just don't get it. NBC's news host, fake news host Megan Kelly boosted the
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:42.360]  social media profile of a person when she aired the interview of him on her show Sunday
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:46.960]  night. But I love the paradox. They cannot even say my name and folks know who they're
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:53.480]  talking about. So it's really a joke on them. Of course, does anybody even want to know
[2:11:53.480 --> 2:11:59.640]  the name of the guy that wrote this story? So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, a total
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:04.160]  joke. Okay, who's been holding the longest here? Let's go ahead, Dr. Zach and then David
[2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:07.160]  and Frank and then Al. Zach, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:11.400]  Alex, thanks for having me. It's good to be back on. And I just wanted to connect some
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:15.800]  dots from a military intelligence perspective. So greetings from St. Com. They hate to hear
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:19.760]  that over the airways, but we're going to do what we got to do. So this whole Russia
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:24.080]  thing, I don't think you know how critical your role is in this because it is critical.
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:27.480]  But I don't know if you saw the Oliver Stone 4P series on Putin.
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:31.800]  I didn't have a chance. I hear it's excellent. Okay. So this, the Oliver Stone piece came
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:36.360]  out just after making Kelly's debacle with him, where she, she basically, I mean, she
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:40.000]  looks like an idiot talking to him. He talks her down. Then they put Oliver Stone, put
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:44.240]  out his piece where he looks completely credible, completely breaking down Syria, completely
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:49.720]  breaking down everything. Then they panic, push your interview, not to mention they panic.
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:54.040]  They hear Russian and Putin's view on North Korea, which is a problem for them. So not
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:12:58.640]  only do they push your interview, demonize you, tie Trump to you, they knock down a plane
[2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:03.800]  in a sovereign country to push Trump to a point where he has to go to blows with Russia
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:08.320]  because they are done. Bezos and the Apple CEO are going to the White House soon. They
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:13.000]  got Kushner in the Middle East now. They've picked their sides and you are critical in
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:17.760]  this. They can't stand it, but nobody cares in the intelligence agencies. They're the
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:21.880]  three letter agencies are incompetent. The only three letter agencies that really matter
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:26.600]  nowadays are WWW. And that's followed by whatever website you want to go to for real
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:30.840]  news. Cause that's the intel. That's what the intel community is listening to. That's
[2:13:30.840 --> 2:13:34.440]  what they're operating under. And we're in this thing. There is a quick thing going
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:39.680]  on. Now they can't stand that they got guys like me and you on the phone, guys like Tim
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:43.360]  Kennedy who are on the ground right now. And I can't get into that getting on your show.
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:48.520]  Okay. But this is real. We sworn oath to the constitution and we are liable in the United
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.440]  States code of military justice to protect and uphold the constitution. So I don't know
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:56.080]  what they think they're pulling, but they are desperate. I got a couple more points.
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:59.960]  They go ahead and elaborate. And you've called before and given us really, really great information.
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:03.760]  And I'm most people I know that are in government agencies are like you said, they're totally
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:07.200]  upset about what's happening. They know we've shot it with radical Islam. They know that
[2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:10.680]  the globalists are trying to sell the country out. They know Hollywood basically runs the
[2:14:10.680 --> 2:14:14.840]  top of the government and just wants to wreck the country in some pissing contest. And so
[2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:19.880]  it's just basic sanity is prevailing. And then Trump wants to knock out ISIS and clean
[2:14:19.880 --> 2:14:25.520]  up the problem, but others inside want a wider war to knock out Assad. So the Russians have
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:32.040]  let Trump or his own people get the chemical dump, blow up the convoy, shoot down the plane.
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:36.360]  Now they're saying no. I'm worried that, you know, Trump obviously isn't calling the shots
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:40.840]  on that. Somebody else in deep state is going to send in an aircraft, launch a missile.
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:43.960]  The Russians are going to shoot it down. They're going to go wake Trump up at two in the morning
[2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:48.160]  and say, sir, the Russians just shot a missile down or they just shot down our plane. And
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:51.680]  then we're off to the races. I mean, this is insanity. If Russia was on our borders
[2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:56.440]  or flooding us with jihadis or in our business, that'd be one thing. But I'm sorry, Russia's
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:01.480]  not in our business, but you've got this rogue state, this rogue deep state up there trying
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:07.040]  to overthrow Trump and trying to box him in now. What's the what's the info you've gotten?
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:13.280]  Where do you see all this going? So basically the media completely overstretched. They're
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:17.200]  bound here. They were completely put off guard by Trump, which stopped the kinetic momentum
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:20.080]  that has built within the military because you have to understand a lot of these generals
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:23.960]  have been there for two, three decades. So presidents are interchangeably as Putin elaborated
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:28.240]  in his sit down with Oliver Stone. However, what they're using is using the media. They're
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:33.320]  using the media as 37 series, 37 series of United States military psychological operations.
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:37.280]  And the media is being used in that capacity for the less in their agenda. However, it's
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:42.240]  blown up in their face. The stock markets are storing. So their investors, their advertisers
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.280]  feel that they like that. They see it's all in a part, but from a military perspective,
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:50.840]  the next 24 to 48 hours is so critical that I just, there's a lot going on and they got
[2:15:50.840 --> 2:15:56.360]  it so distracted. I don't think people understand, but make no mistake, Russia is the only government
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:15:59.840]  in Syria that has been invited. I understand ISIS is there. I understand how it's going
[2:15:59.840 --> 2:16:04.680]  on. That is a sovereign country. And the only government that has been invited there is
[2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:09.280]  the Russians. And that's what Vladimir Putin talks about a week ago. So it's no coincidence
[2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:14.480]  that they pushed your interview up, tied you to Trump, and shot down a plane in seemingly
[2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:19.520]  real time to create the fascist because they are freaking out. They do not have a psychological
[2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:24.440]  When I've covered Bilderberg, the first time this ever happened, it was when I was covered
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:29.480]  Bilderberg like 10 years ago in person, my cell phone didn't work well. It was dropping
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:35.360]  cell. It was, it was dropping bars. It was losing its power like 10 times faster, getting
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:40.160]  real hot in my pocket. It happened to everybody. Then I even had guys pop in sometimes and
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:44.040]  make threats and things and laugh at us. And then one time I was in the hotel before they
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:47.960]  shut it down in Chantilly and went into a back room where they were all in a conference
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:53.480]  room listening to the phones and stuff in live time, a bunch of different agencies.
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:57.480]  That kind of sat there and listened to them talking, Whoa, that's this Navy satellite.
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:01.280]  You got to use that Air Force satellite to track that one. That's how we pick up those
[2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:05.880]  feeds on those phones. And then I'm like, Hi guys, and they all completely freaked out.
[2:17:05.880 --> 2:17:10.880]  But the point is, it's been a while since in live time, they're jacked into my phone
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:14.560]  using it as an audio device. It happened to the engineers. It happened to a bunch of the
[2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:20.240]  writers in the last week. So then I realized, Oh my gosh, this, this Megan Kelly thing is
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:25.960]  part of a larger Psyop, again, to discredit Trump, but it didn't work. It had record low
[2:17:25.960 --> 2:17:31.960]  viewers. Not only did, not only did it not work, you have Kushner going to the police
[2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:36.560]  and you have Cook, the Apple CEO and Bezos going to the White House. This is a signal
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:40.640]  to the financial markets. They've picked their sides. That side of the media is done. They
[2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:44.680]  not only did they lose the election, they lost control. They lost control and they
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:49.160]  cannot back them anymore. Okay. This is critical though, because you do have rogue elements
[2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:52.560]  who are operators on the ground right now. Again, these people have been there for two,
[2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:56.280]  three decades, but make no mistake. This is the message to the president of the United
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:01.480]  States. Mr. President, we need you on the ground in McDale and St. Com. You could be
[2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:05.560]  read in on this and you have to take charge. That's all there is to it. You are in charge.
[2:18:05.560 --> 2:18:09.240]  Okay. These guys who are power hungry and out of control, they're there. They're read
[2:18:09.240 --> 2:18:13.240]  in. They're, they're made men, but you have the power to literally trump them, help sink
[2:18:13.240 --> 2:18:17.200]  and you need to do it because when you got guys like me, just like George Washington,
[2:18:17.200 --> 2:18:21.320]  he has to take direct command of the military because he's so, he's so respectful of everything.
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:25.360]  He turned it over to the military thinking it wasn't infiltrated. He doesn't know it's
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:29.920]  been infiltrated as well. And when there's guys like me and Tintini on the ground, we're
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:32.000]  just not going to follow that order and I hate to tell you that, but I'm not going to
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:35.800]  commit treason. I rose my right hand in front of that, in front of that American flag. I
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:39.240]  met station in Tampa, Florida before I joined the United States military. Now I'm out of
[2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:41.720]  active duty, but I do some things. I won't get into that.
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:46.720]  Well, I'm sure everybody does things after they're out. Exactly. But expanding on this,
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:50.760]  expanding, I want the listeners to realize the left wants a civil war. They're pushing
[2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:55.600]  one for real. And then once it starts, they're going to claim everybody that's pro-gun, pro-America
[2:18:55.600 --> 2:18:59.720]  is a Russian agent. That's why they've had a Washington Post article saying we got guns
[2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:04.160]  and God from the Russians. Literally saying if we want guns and God, we got it from the
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:09.440]  Russians. That sounds like crazy branding, but to their libtard audience, it's real.
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:14.720]  Now again, I've wargamed this. I don't think this globalist takeover is going to work.
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:17.640]  That's why they need to back off and pull back right now.
[2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:24.760]  If you put together a timeline of the Megyn Kelly-Putin interview, sit down, that immediately
[2:19:24.760 --> 2:19:29.720]  followed by the four-day series of the four-part series on Showtime with Putin. You follow
[2:19:29.720 --> 2:19:35.240]  that up with the lead up to your show with Megyn Kelly and the shooting down of the Syrian
[2:19:35.240 --> 2:19:40.960]  plane. I got to tell you, it's obvious. And it's not a big secret. And quite frankly,
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:45.880]  the exercises that they have planned for the later in the year, just not military, not
[2:19:45.880 --> 2:19:51.720]  attack exercises, but for operational exercises, this is out of control. This has been planned
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:55.760]  two, three years ago. And the president of the United States has the authority to land
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:59.280]  that Air Force One in McHale, get read in.
[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:01.360]  Now I hear that. All right, we'll be back. Good points.
[2:20:01.360 --> 2:20:05.640]  Diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety meds, everyone's on them. If you're a 50-year-old
[2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:09.760]  male, maybe a bit porky, and you may even have type 2 diabetes, a million dollars of
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:15.320]  term insurance may only cost you about 200 bucks a month. Call term provider. Speak with

[2:21:00.440 --> 2:21:03.960]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:08.800]  in stock at m4store.com. The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week. I thought
[2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:12.440]  it would be a six-month supply for listeners. And since then, people are beating down our
[2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:17.680]  doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue. Research across the board is clear.
[2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:21.960]  In fact, it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and
[2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:26.160]  even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks. That's why the Last Surgeon General's report
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:31.120]  on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:21:31.120 --> 2:21:35.560]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodide,
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:39.960]  instead of the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:44.600]  used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just
[2:21:44.600 --> 2:21:49.400]  some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint
[2:21:49.400 --> 2:21:55.000]  oil, iodine, nano silver and more. Learn more about M4's Life Super Blue toothpaste

[2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:04.760]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate. I love
[2:22:04.760 --> 2:22:08.760]  these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[2:22:08.760 --> 2:22:13.320]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards. We all look forward to
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:17.640]  garden tomatoes and corn on the cob. Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve
[2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:22.240]  their true taste and flavors? I'm here to tell you that there is a better way. It's
[2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:27.760]  by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right. I have a Harvest Right freeze
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:32.920]  dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love. Strawberries, apples and even lasagna and
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:38.460]  ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years. And the best part of my freeze drying is my family
[2:22:38.460 --> 2:22:43.640]  and I have a supply of long lasting food on hand. So no matter what may come, we feel
[2:22:43.640 --> 2:22:49.240]  better prepared. We love our freeze dryer. To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call

[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:32.880]  It's a no brainer. A big burky water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:38.200]  filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides,
[2:23:38.200 --> 2:23:42.400]  bacteria, viruses and much more, right? And does it all at only 2 cents per gallon. Get

[2:24:15.600 --> 2:24:19.520]  It is crazy to see MSM take stuff I've said and cut it all together, take it out of context
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:24.600]  and then blow my face up even bigger than it is and then sit there and cut into gotcha
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:29.440]  moments that didn't even happen. And to realize that it still fell flat on its face, not because
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:35.440]  I was strong, but because they are so discredited and have been caught lying so much, it's helped
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:39.400]  info wars and hurt them. But they're still in control at the top, just like you heard
[2:24:39.400 --> 2:24:44.320]  the last caller, and they're trying to start a war to take control of the presidency. It's
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:48.680]  a dangerous time. We've got Dave, Frank, Al right now and O'Brien as well. Let's go
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:53.200]  ahead and go to Frank in Florida. Frank, thanks for holding.
[2:24:53.200 --> 2:24:58.600]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call today. Yeah, I want to pack up with that previous
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:03.960]  caller. I do agree with a lot of what he put out there. I think what's been lost in some
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:10.640]  of this though was the timing of the shooting at the charity baseball practice and the Meg
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:15.880]  and Kelly interview with you. I think it's too coincidental because the New York Times
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:21.600]  is not backed off throwing out that target vector the way that they did. And now they
[2:25:21.600 --> 2:25:26.560]  have this hit piece rolling on you where, you know, I mean, you might be looking at
[2:25:26.560 --> 2:25:30.920]  it from an educated point of view, but when you take the other side of it, the uninformed,
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:36.400]  the windup toys, how are they going to see it because I agree. I mean, I agree. It looked
[2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:41.760]  like it was designed to make people come after me. I mean, is that what you're saying is
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:44.040]  it looks like it's trying to wind up somebody for violence?
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:48.280]  Yup, because they're using the children again. They wanted to bring up the new town children
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:52.720]  and tie in that whole narrative. So you have that, you have the Russian plane shoot down.
[2:25:52.720 --> 2:25:56.680]  Now how much do you want to bet that maybe the killing hasn't happened fast enough in
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:01.360]  Ramadan in London? So you could say that was a right winger over there. Nobody knows yet.
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:05.280]  How do you know that's not a windup toy to get that speeded up? The one last missing
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:10.480]  piece I'm seeing happening here in the United States is a major racial set off to get things
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:14.080]  going on the street. And they've got that Soros is funding hundreds of millions just
[2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:19.080]  for July 2nd. And the groups are all online saying go out, attack, kill white people,
[2:26:19.080 --> 2:26:24.320]  kill cops, and it's white people leading it. And then I'm wondering why the police and
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:27.040]  the different state agencies are putting up with this. We don't have a federal government
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:29.600]  right now. They need to move against these people.
[2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:33.880]  Yeah, exactly. I agree because I think this is the empire is stricken back and right
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:39.760]  now is absolutely the time for Trump to start moving, get the fireside chance going, start
[2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:46.080]  the cleaning house, let sessions loose, let the new AG that's going to step up if Rosenstein
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:51.320]  does recuse himself, let her loose. Yeah, they're flailing right now. I think they can
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:55.760]  see the writing on the wall. Absolutely. We're in quite a fight. God bless you, my friend.
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:26:59.760]  Great points. What amazing colors. I should go to your calls earlier. I'm really honored
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:06.560]  to be in this position. Quite frankly, I mean, quite frankly, I just can't believe that info
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:10.600]  wars is so prominent. It's the opposite of a power trip. I feel like I'm doing a terrible
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:13.360]  job, but I'm not trying to fish for folks say, oh, no, you're doing a good job. I just
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:17.840]  can't help with the magnitude of all this. Just to ask myself, how have we gotten in
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:22.560]  this position? A lot of good men out there aren't doing anything and you need to do something
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:27.080]  folks politically to speak out now to put the brakes on this and women as well. But
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:32.280]  this country is on the verge of a psychotic civil war with crazy leftist running around
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:37.040]  attacking people everywhere. And they have no idea historically what they're walking
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:41.600]  into. I don't think the elites know what they're doing. I think they just want total control
[2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:50.480]  and their messed up brains don't realize that they're going to lose. Let's go to Dave and
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:55.600]  then I'll go to Al. Thanks for holding Dave. Go ahead and Florida.
[2:27:55.600 --> 2:28:02.440]  Yeah, Alex. Thanks for making my call on the U.S. Air Force radar operator and weapons
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:10.840]  analyst and this deafening cargo ship that ran into our warship. Totally bogus. I mean,
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:15.400]  it's crazy to think that that's what happened. We're trying to just spread it our military.
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:19.480]  Sure. I'm not a naval guy like you, but I know the new radar they've got will see like
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:24.000]  a 10 can floating a half, you know, half mile, two miles away. I mean, describe it folks
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:29.280]  why you're saying it's bull just because they've got proximity sensors. You name it?
[2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:35.920]  Well, they keep a 50 mile radius around the ship. And if it's that those radars are down
[2:28:35.920 --> 2:28:41.360]  for maintenance, they'll use the satellite data link to make sure that there's no other
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:47.880]  shit in the area. So I just can't tell them this happening and just just spreading in
[2:28:47.880 --> 2:28:51.880]  our military. Well, the Navy agrees with you. They say they don't understand. They don't
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:59.480]  understand how this happened. I think they're just trying to show weakness to our military
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:09.360]  and destroy our morale. Well, that's a question. I mean, how did this freighter container ship
[2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:13.760]  when then that's giant on a radar signature? I mean, I've been on commercial ships and
[2:29:13.760 --> 2:29:19.400]  see their radar going out just many, many miles. I don't know how that happened. Well,
[2:29:19.400 --> 2:29:25.600]  the container ship has radar too. So I don't I just it's just an unknown thing that's driving
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:35.560]  me crazy. A lot of weird stuff's going on. It really it really is strange. Bizarre. Wow.
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:43.000]  Thank you so much, Dave. That's the that's the thing. You know, I just got a bad feeling
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:47.560]  about Russia right now and all the stuff is going on. I just I just don't know. Stay
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:54.480]  with us. More calls coming up. We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[2:29:54.480 --> 2:30:03.720]  and the GCN radio network. Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine. On
[2:30:03.720 --> 2:30:08.000]  Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed the stage of the New York Public Disgrace Theater showing
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:12.560]  of Caesar, which should really be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President
[2:30:12.560 --> 2:30:16.640]  Trump. She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:21.400]  hands as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and
[2:30:21.400 --> 2:30:26.000]  hatred. While she was being arrested, Jack Pasobic went live on Twitter to broadcast
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:29.960]  the event and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:34.560]  Joseph Goebbels would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis. While the left is
[2:30:34.560 --> 2:30:38.520]  having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the Trump movement
[2:30:38.520 --> 2:30:43.400]  have been at odds over the protest. Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took
[2:30:43.400 --> 2:30:48.480]  the stage. Shouting Goebbels would be proud. CNN is ISIS. While the protesters were all
[2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:53.200]  arrested, rumor has it some of the police involved support the protest against the expression
[2:30:53.200 --> 2:30:57.880]  of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York Public Theater against our president.
[2:30:57.880 --> 2:31:02.880]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer. It's not just our water we need to filter. It's
[2:31:02.880 --> 2:31:06.720]  not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially
[2:31:06.720 --> 2:31:12.560]  for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down
[2:31:12.560 --> 2:31:17.000]  on our immune systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:23.120]  Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:27.280]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family,
[2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:32.320]  your children. Do the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning
[2:31:32.320 --> 2:31:37.680]  our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:42.760]  of themselves. The general public hasn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at
[2:31:42.760 --> 2:31:48.360]  $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This
[2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:52.880]  is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters
[2:31:52.880 --> 2:32:02.320]  that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today. Infowars.com.
[2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:06.200]  The reason Infowars.com has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[2:32:06.200 --> 2:32:09.920]  products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this. And then

[2:32:21.680 --> 2:32:26.360]  noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that
[2:32:26.360 --> 2:32:31.080]  was life changing for me. Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super female. I had
[2:32:31.080 --> 2:32:37.040]  a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very
[2:32:37.040 --> 2:32:43.400]  exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So
[2:32:43.400 --> 2:32:46.240]  obviously the super female is amazing. I love it.
[2:32:46.240 --> 2:32:51.080]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say
[2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:55.960]  is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield X2. It's got
[2:32:55.960 --> 2:33:02.960]  a five star rating. It's a win win. Infowarslife.com.

[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:42.120]  Kelly attacked him as well last night. We're going to go to Al and Eric and of course O'Brien
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:49.960]  and then we're going to go to the next one. And then we're going to go to the next one.
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:55.960]  We're going to go to Al and Eric and of course O'Brien and Joseph before we end the shower.
[2:33:55.960 --> 2:34:01.960]  Mike Cernovich is going to be hosting the fourth hour today. David Knight took a personal day,
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:05.960]  so that will be Mike Cernovich who's here visiting. I'm trying to launch a larger radio
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:09.960]  slash TV networks. We can have more hosts with their own shows doing their own thing.
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:14.960]  We can have Joe hopefully come back and do that once we have all that launched. But so
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:18.960]  much going on, so much happening. First off, to do that we need to fund the operation.
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:22.960]  We have free shipping that runs through the rest of the week and I decided to bring the
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:27.960]  Fourth of July sale that we're going to have in a few weeks to you now. We're going to
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:30.960]  do something else on the Fourth of July. We're going to have a free shipping store-wide
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:35.960]  survival shield, the good X2, you know, the good nation iodine that cleans out the garbage,
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:40.960]  blocks the bad halogens. Survival shield X2, 30% off even though we're selling out of it.
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:45.960]  Z shield, the heavy metal and toxin detox are brand new product with all the shillage
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:49.960]  and the zeolife and everything else to draw the garbage out of your body. InfoWars select
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:55.960]  storeable foods, 40% off. We rarely do that. Emmerich's Essentials Outdoor Pack, 40% off.
[2:34:55.960 --> 2:35:00.960]  And if you add on auto ship, it's a lost leader. So living defense, 20% off even though it's
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.960]  about to sell out to flush all those parasites out. InfoWarsStore.com or
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:11.960]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. I want to thank you all for your
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:15.960]  support. I'm trying to expand in the face of the globalists and we cannot do it without you.
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:20.960]  Now we have a lot of stuff that sells quite a bit, but a lot of it like knockout we make
[2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:25.960]  almost no money on because I designed it. I just thought, why am I taking some L-Triptophan
[2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:31.960]  and Valerian root and, you know, sometimes melatonin to sleep good when it costs me like
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:35.960]  $60 for all three of these bottles. I went and checked how much that stuff actually costs
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:39.960]  or like, you know, that cost a dollar, that cost 30 cents, that cost a dollar, that cost
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:44.960]  20 cents. And I said, we'll sell it for $19.95 and it'll have nine ingredients. Each
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:49.960]  ingredient has the same level, the leading competitor. So $19 for the same amount of
[2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:54.960]  melatonin, we have at $19 with all the other stuff in Mother Nature to really knock you out.
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:57.960]  I just get mad when I forget to take it and then wake up at 3 a.m. That's what happens.
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:01.960]  I'm going to bed at like 10, I'll wake up at 3 a.m. And if I take my knockout, I don't.
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:06.960]  We got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation. It has lemon balm extract, it has melatonin,
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:10.960]  it'll tryptophan, valerian root, and so much more. Plus it's got T amino acids to help
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:16.960]  you upload it electrochemically into the brain. But again, ladies and gentlemen, there are
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:21.960]  so many of these great products. Be sure and check them out today so we can fund the operation.
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:26.960]  Want to salute you all and thank you for what you do. You make it all possible. And a lot
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:30.960]  of stuff you notice is sold out for five, six months. It's not done to create artificial
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:35.960]  scarcity. It's done because we try to follow California standards. Almost all of our products
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:39.960]  are at that level. Sometimes we just can't get stuff that's California standard because
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:43.960]  it has to have less heavy metal than the air does in it. And so we discontinue a product
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:46.960]  or we discontinue stuff in it. In fact, I'm getting ready to discontinue three or four
[2:36:46.960 --> 2:36:52.960]  products or change it up in case you can't get the ingredients are totally clean. So
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:57.960]  it's kind of like, you know, if I had DNA force in all the time and if I had a few other
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:02.960]  products in like Caveman, we could fund this whole thing. Caveman, four months to make
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:06.960]  more of it because it's so hard to get the organic bone broth. I mean, it's just bringing
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:10.960]  you quality like this. The reason we are loved by the supplement Nazis, that's a
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:14.960]  Seinfeld illusion. We're not real Nazis by the real folks that are experts on supplements.
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:19.960]  Third party sites is we go to a super neurotic level to treat you like we want to be treated.
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:25.960]  But also we know we're a target of the FDA and others. So we want to be next level, you
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:29.960]  know, game changing. So that's why the big 30 part third party sites love us because we're
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:34.960]  using the top companies, the cleanest companies in the nation. But at one point, if I can't
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:38.960]  get a product because it's got to be so clean for myself, I'll go, okay, forget California
[2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:42.960]  standards. So I treat you like I want to be treated. So if we start not being California
[2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:46.960]  standards, start putting it on our products, you know, I'll tell you why, because I'm going
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:50.960]  to be taking it too. It's either don't have it or have it. The earth's going to get so contaminated.
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:55.960]  You know, nothing will be perfectly clean. I'm not going to get into it anymore. The point
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:37:59.960]  is these are the cleanest, highest quality organic products out there in full war store.com
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:08.960]  info wars life.com. Now joining us joining us in studio Joe Biggs info wars auxiliary
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:12.960]  reporter freelance reporter does his own great work. Joe is great to have you here with us.
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:16.960]  Oh, yeah, it's been a while. Looking sharp in the black on black. Yes, sir. You're all
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:23.960]  murdered out in your suit right now. Oh, yeah. Time to go to war. Hey, how is it being a daddy?
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:28.960]  Oh, you know, I'm getting used to being back on that military regiment of not sleeping
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:33.960]  hardly ever and barely eating. But I'm kind of getting used to it. I mean, there's a few
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:37.960]  nights where I was like, but it's like I went to bed at six. I was up at nine to do the
[2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:41.960]  Gavin McGinnis show. I'm here now. I'm wide awake. I'm good to go. It's awesome. Like it's
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:46.960]  cool looking at like a little thing that's just like you. It's pretty. I like your wedding
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:50.960]  ring too. Pretty normal. I never found this cool. Maybe I'm just copy you. And there's
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:53.960]  your little sweetheart wearing a Trump shirt. Oh, yeah, she's got it on right now. She's
[2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:57.960]  trying to build the wall. And of course, you know, well, Obama said kids that play with
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:39:02.960]  Legos, they didn't build that getting serious. I guess you weren't watching the Megan Kelly
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:06.960]  thing last night. You told me on the phone this morning and you got blown up. What happened?
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:09.960]  Yeah, my phone started going off and they're like, Are you are you seeing this interview
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:11.960]  right now? And I go, What are you talking about? Is it on already? And they're like, Yeah,
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:17.960]  the Megan Kelly thing, they're blasting your border video. And I go, What? Why? What does
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:21.960]  it have to do with anything? I've been to the border so many times. It took me about
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:24.960]  an hour to figure out which video they were talking about. And when they pick that one,
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:29.960]  I was the most shocked. I was like, I like, did you actually think that I went down to
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:34.960]  Laredo? I found like seven, you know, cartel guys that come stages event or something. I
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:40.960]  mean, what do you I mean, what is making Kelly think they're smuggling pinatas? Like
[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:44.960]  a little baby, like little teddy bears to give the Glenn Beck so he can smudge Cheetos all
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:48.960]  the time. He's like blaze with him. That's what I was saying. I love or like, Yeah,
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:52.960]  they're like smuggling keyboard elves or something. Like, I'm like, these guys are
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:56.960]  literally risking life and limb to come over the board illegally. And then they throw
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:40:01.960]  these satchels into a back of a was like a burgundy Ford Explorer. And it runs off
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:06.960]  its speeds off and almost gets hit T bone by a tractor trailer shock. I mean, you don't
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:09.960]  do that. Meanwhile, you guys were in the hotel right there. There's like people creeping
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:13.960]  around, trying to get in your rooms. So when we were out there, when Josh shows and I
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:19.960]  were out there on the riverbank at the Rio Grande and Laredo, we noticed right before
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:23.960]  this whole thing happened, we saw two Border Patrol vehicles jet off. We thought that was
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:27.960]  kind of weird. Then two or three little boys came down, one was bouncing a basketball,
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:31.960]  one had a flip phone and one another one had a cell phone and they were filming my stand
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:34.960]  up. And I was talking about how Donald Trump was going to be coming to Laredo tomorrow.
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:38.960]  This is going to be his first trip to the border. You know, this is a very key thing
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:42.960]  that's going to happen to really, you know, solidify and talk about why we need to secure
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.960]  the border and what it is we can do to help, you know, lock this down and keep bad people
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:48.960]  from coming in.
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:52.960]  It's the basic newsworthy report. We're in Texas. Go cover before the president comes.
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:56.960]  And he just, I mean, it just happens to happen. I mean, right there. I mean, you're on the
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  border. We've been covering border issues for I don't know how long since I've been here
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  for the last four years, myself, Jakari Jackson, Don Salazar, Kid Daniels, John Bown. We've
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:08.960]  all been out there and every time we've been out there, we've caught some kind of thing
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:09.960]  happening.
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:13.960]  We've had ICE tell you stuff behind the scenes and on record and the police. And so we've
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:16.960]  got, and you've been debriefed by the FBI. You've gone over the border. You discovered
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:21.960]  the ISIS house, which a year later, a judicial watch confirmed in government documents was
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:22.960]  an ISIS base.
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:26.960]  And they did a documentary that was aired in January on their YouTube page. It only has
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:31.960]  3,000 views. It's called the Sun City Sale. And it talks about actual al-Qaeda members,
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:36.960]  top al-Qaeda members flying into Dona Ana, New Mexico into a private airport that's not
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  even monitored by our U.S. government. And these guys get out and go into Anthony, New
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:46.960]  Mexico, these two top al-Qaeda leaders, and meet with cartel guys and figure out a game
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:47.960]  plan on how they...
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:53.960]  So that said, you're a military guy that's been in Rolling Stone and other big profiles
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:57.960]  covering you in combat and you've been on TV shows and you've been a journalist for years
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:42:01.960]  and you've broken a lot of big stories and you've gotten big interviews. But Meggy Kelly
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:06.960]  doesn't care. She shows Owen Schreuer and says, he's not real. He doesn't do research.
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:10.960]  He's bad. And then she cuts to you and she goes, part of Alex Jones' fakeness. Well,
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:13.960]  here, let's play the clip. Let's play the clip for Meggy Kelly.
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:16.960]  I mean, I know Trump watches and sees the clips and things.
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  We did find indications of that. On July 22nd, 2015, InfoWars put up this video claiming it
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:28.960]  showed drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border, although we don't know what it actually
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:29.960]  shows.
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:35.960]  We witnessed a drug smuggling operation from Mexico into the U.S.
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:38.960]  Three days later, Mr. Trump gave this speech in Iowa.
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:44.960]  Big story. It's all over the place now. Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff,
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:48.960]  drugs swimming across the river.
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:53.960]  And then she goes on to demonize this. Now, again, we have HD footage of broad daylight,
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:58.960]  people coming across with these big 55-pound bags. We've shown it to law enforcement.
[2:42:58.960 --> 2:43:02.960]  They go, yes, that's marijuana. It's floating. The cartels package it the same.
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:04.960]  It's well known. And then they've got the waiting car.
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:08.960]  You guys get both angles of it. It's clearly drugs. It's clearly something illegal.
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:14.960]  They just smuggled it across international lines, national lines, so it is illegal.
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:17.960]  And so this is how they do it in these green and brown satchels.
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:22.960]  We have the total proof. She knows our report shows the FBI briefing you.
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:27.960]  She knows your report shows where you talk to the state police and the border patrol.
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:29.960]  You've got it all just like you're supposed to in a report.
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:33.960]  Even the local orado news picked up on it. And they were playing that on their nightly news.
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:37.960]  Sure. Everyone said it was obviously drugs. But no, no, no, no.
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:42.960]  But see, we're not allowed. Here's the key to look at that as our own journals
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:46.960]  and go down and show it and catch it. That's a great find for anybody.
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:51.960]  That's an A-plus. That's the thing you want awards for, but not Megan Kelly's, see.
[2:43:51.960 --> 2:43:53.960]  And again, it's the whole reports like that.
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:58.960]  The problem was, I shouldn't have let her interview me off and on. They were here from 9.30 to 11.
[2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:02.960]  They had me off this house for almost two hours. And I noticed she kept asking the same questions
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:05.960]  and then doing gotchas and then saying really insulting things.
[2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:10.960]  Well, the funny thing is how she questions you and Owen and others about being a journalist.
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:14.960]  Meanwhile, she's the same lady who sits down behind a desk, reads a teleprompter
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:18.960]  and reads words that another person came up with. They're not even original thoughts, 90%.
[2:44:18.960 --> 2:44:20.960]  That's a really good point, Joe.
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:25.960]  That's not even, you're not even a journalist. And how many times have you been even down to the border, Megan Kelly?
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:30.960]  How many times have you even gotten behind, out from behind your desk, other than coming down to Austin to speak to Alex?
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:37.960]  That's a great point. She's a teleprompter reader. We're our own organic citizen media just going out trying to tell the truth.
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:41.960]  I was in the Ferguson riots, the Baltimore riots in Milwaukee. I was in Paris a day after the attacks.
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:48.960]  I was at the St. Denis raids in northern Paris when they found the lady and the guys that blew themselves up with a suicide vest.
[2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:52.960]  You flew in on a dirt runway with Michael Zimmerman and Gary Haven, who's back in tomorrow.
[2:44:52.960 --> 2:44:54.960]  If you want to come in on Wednesday, you can be with him, too.
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:55.960]  Sure.
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:00.960]  I promise, because I've been working seven days a week for months, and I obviously got my children. It's the summer.
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:04.960]  You want to come in and co-host the show on Wednesday?
[2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:05.960]  Sure. Why not?
[2:45:05.960 --> 2:45:12.960]  Good. Well, we'll program it with you and Owen Schreuer. And if David Knight's better by then, he's got a cold.
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:17.960]  I said personal day, but he's got a cold. You can't drag David away from the microphone. Just like me, it's a good thing.
[2:45:17.960 --> 2:45:21.960]  But I'm taking off two days because I'm getting a little crazed behind the scenes here.
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:24.960]  So I'm going to give everybody a break. I'm going to take two days off.
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:27.960]  So that's great. Come in and host Wednesday.
[2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:28.960]  Sounds good.
[2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:31.960]  And so just come in about an hour before they can run through all the stories.
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:33.960]  I won't be able to control myself. I'll undoubtedly call in.
[2:45:33.960 --> 2:45:35.960]  And then you guys can run the gamut.
[2:45:35.960 --> 2:45:36.960]  Sounds good.
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:37.960]  All right.
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:44.960]  But continuing, a lot of folks I talked to say, hey, you showed the early video. You showed she was a liar.
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:47.960]  It was a hit piece. You don't even need to release all the audio.
[2:45:47.960 --> 2:45:50.960]  But I said I would. And Sean Hannity has a point.
[2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:53.960]  He wants it released. And I've been called by other folks at Fox.
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:58.960]  They are very interested in it. They won't tell me why. They just say execs are very interested.
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:03.960]  And I think this is kind of a career killer to have her editing things out of out of sync.
[2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:08.960]  Well, I mean, you've got her clearly on audio saying, hey, this isn't a gotcha piece. This isn't a hit piece.
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:12.960]  I'm profiling you as Alex. This isn't the conspiracy.
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:15.960]  I'm obsessed with you. I think I want to show your good side.
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:20.960]  She's like, yeah, I've been really following you ever since your family court case and all that.
[2:46:20.960 --> 2:46:22.960]  I'm interested in Alex Jones, the person.
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:27.960]  And then it's just like, boom, boom, boom, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, you know, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:28.960]  And I'm just sitting here like, wow.
[2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:31.960]  She says it will not be a gotcha piece. And she literally goes, gotcha.
[2:46:31.960 --> 2:46:37.960]  Actually, we went gotcha. She tried to go gotcha and we actually did a better one on her.
[2:46:37.960 --> 2:46:39.960]  I mean, right now she's losing.
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:43.960]  Can you believe her show has half the ratings it had when she started?
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:44.960]  It's worse than what is it?
[2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:52.960]  Joe, we had 20 something million views on Info Wars in between me and Cernovich just on like 10 videos or so we did.
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:57.960]  I mean, that's just me counting up the videos I looked at. 22 million or more views.
[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:00.960]  And then her show has 3.5. These people are a joke.
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:05.960]  I'm sure the like reruns of Andy Griffith are probably getting more views than her show.
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:07.960]  That's a quality program right there. Exactly.
[2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:10.960]  So where do you think she got? I'm not an enemy with her either.
[2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:13.960]  Where does she go? I don't know. Hopefully back under the rocks she came from.
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:17.960]  Maybe just go home and be a mom. You know, go be a wife, go be a mom.
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:21.960]  What do you think this signifies for MSM that they threw everything they could at us?
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:24.960]  Obviously to hurt Trump. I mean, why do they hate Trump so much?
[2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:30.960]  I mean, he's got so much done. I can't help but fawn over him because if I don't, it's a lie.
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:34.960]  I mean, we ought to throw rose petals in front of his feet. He's being demonized. He's being lied to.
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:37.960]  They're trying to destroy him. They're saying kill him everywhere.
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:40.960]  And all he's done is gotten the economy turned back on.
[2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:44.960]  And he still may fail. Ron Paul says he's doing a great job, but it's sputtering folks.
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:46.960]  And what are these people going to do when they blow up the economy?
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:52.960]  Well, think about how the mainstream media kicked Barack Obama's butt, or kissed his butt the entire time.
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  Nonstop day in and day out.
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:59.960]  They said ban a Hispanic guy doing a rodeo clown of Obama. They had that banned.
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:02.960]  But they say let us openly say kill the president.
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:06.960]  You know, Barack Obama even frothed the mouth like, oh, I love CNN. I love MSNBC.
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:09.960]  These guys are so great. And President Trump's not doing that.
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:12.960]  He goes, you guys are fake news. He's like, actually, no, you're really fake news.
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:15.960]  And your BS and your BS and your BS.
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:21.960]  And then what pisses Megyn Kelly off is the fact that she sees that the president is watching real news
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:24.960]  and sharing our stories and watching it and getting some information.
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:29.960]  Because how can she say that we're not journalists when she doesn't get out from behind her desk?
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:33.960]  I'm on the border. We're on the border. We're in France. We're in London. We're all over the place.
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:38.960]  We go all over the world. Has she ever been to Haiti? Has she uncovered anything out there? Negative.
[2:48:38.960 --> 2:48:40.960]  She doesn't even have her own original thoughts.
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:43.960]  By the way, can you guys pull up landing in Haiti, Joe Biggs?
[2:48:43.960 --> 2:48:46.960]  And Zimmerman, I had no idea that people died that day landing there.
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:47.960]  High winds. They're landing.
[2:48:47.960 --> 2:48:49.960]  Oh, right after we left. It was like the day after.
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:53.960]  You're like landing. There's like six foot grass. He's landing. I mean, what?
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:48:59.960]  And then there was a ship. I can't remember what military was. There was a ship that came in and approached the bank
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:03.960]  where I had to get into a boat that was sinking the day before.
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:09.960]  There was a boat that came in to bring aid to be dropped off and the local Haitians ran because they were starving.
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:11.960]  I mean, they just had a hurricane Matthew. They have no food.
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:15.960]  All the trees when you flew overhead, it looked like toothpicks laying down.
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:19.960]  And these hungry Haitians are storming towards the beach because they just want food.
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:22.960]  And the military opened up and started shooting them and mowing them down.
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:25.960]  I mean, just the things that happened there were horrific.
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:29.960]  And you guys found out about the pedophilia, which six months later AP confirmed.
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:30.960]  Yeah.
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:33.960]  But notice, they don't talk about all our victories. They just make up stuff we didn't do.
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:34.960]  Yeah.
[2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:39.960]  But let me ask you this question again, just a microcosm of that show saying we're not real journalists.
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:45.960]  We don't know that was drugs when even local news said clearly it was law enforcement came and met a great job.
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:47.960]  We got the articles of the FBI met with you.
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:48.960]  How does she do that?
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:54.960]  Does she not get that everyone watching goes, obviously that's drugs being smuggled across the Rio Grande.
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:57.960]  Oh, yeah. People were tweeting me all day yesterday, writing me messages on Facebook.
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:03.960]  Like, what did you think was coming across, you know, you know, teddy bears or, you know, humanitarian aid?
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:07.960]  I'm like, yeah, that's exactly what was coming across. Humanitarian aid.
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:08.960]  Yeah.
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:09.960]  Some little social.
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:11.960]  Yeah. Here you maniac start landing on the grass.
[2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:12.960]  Yeah.
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:13.960]  That's never even been landed on.
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:14.960]  And at the end is a cliff.
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:15.960]  Yeah.
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:26.960]  This right here is a spot where Don Marie, that's where we got surrounded by like 500 Haitians are running up to us surrounding us in this plane.
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:27.960]  We're in the middle of nowhere.
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:29.960]  I mean, you've got nowhere to go.
[2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:33.960]  You're the furthest western tip on the southern peninsula of Haiti.
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:34.960]  There is.
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:37.960]  And you're on your own.
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:40.960]  Man, look at that devastation.
[2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:43.960]  But this is real reporting NBC doesn't do this.
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:45.960]  No, they're too scared.
[2:50:45.960 --> 2:50:51.960]  Well, let's come back and talk more about the Russia situation because clearly deep stage trying to start a war with Russia.
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:52.960]  What will that do for us?
[2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:53.960]  And then Mike Sernovich is coming in.
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:54.960]  I'm going to your phone calls.
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:57.960]  Oh, Brian, Joseph, Eric, Al, I'm going to y'all.
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:50:59.960]  I'm coming to you.
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:04.960]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman in Republican presidential candidate.
[2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:12.960]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:15.960]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:51:15.960 --> 2:51:19.960]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:22.960]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:26.960]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[2:51:26.960 --> 2:51:30.960]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:35.960]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:51:35.960 --> 2:51:41.960]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting food on hand.
[2:51:41.960 --> 2:51:44.960]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:46.960]  We love our freeze dryer.

[2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:13.960]  Alright, I think I'm going to go ahead and co-host Cernovich into the fourth hour
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:15.960]  and Joe Bayes wants to write a shot and he's welcome.
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:17.960]  I need to go to these callers who've been holding patiently.
[2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:19.960]  Look, I haven't even Googled my name today.
[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:22.960]  I just did it during the break because I noticed the computer was still on over here
[2:54:22.960 --> 2:54:25.960]  where we've been doing it last night, seeing the coverage.
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:30.960]  And it says, what we learned from enduring a week-long news cycle about Alex Jones
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:34.960]  and then what they learned is we're sitting there with the champagne toasting
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:38.960]  because, wow, they really are that pathetic.
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:44.960]  I want to go to these calls Al and others, but it's not that we're that good.
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:48.960]  I want to be clear, pride go before a fall, it's that they're that pathetic.
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:54.960]  I mean, did you see geriatric Tom Brokaw come out calling me a racist again
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:57.960]  and then not showing proof? How unjournalistic?
[2:54:57.960 --> 2:55:00.960]  I mean, if I called somebody a racist, I'm going to show you the clip.
[2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:03.960]  Well, I thought it was hilarious too when she goes, she looks at O and she goes,
[2:55:03.960 --> 2:55:05.960]  so do you consider yourself a journalist?
[2:55:05.960 --> 2:55:07.960]  You know, what do you do in the morning when you come into the office?
[2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:10.960]  He goes, well, I look at the news, I see what's going on,
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:12.960]  and then I kind of give my analysis on everything.
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:14.960]  That's still more than what she does.
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:17.960]  She wakes up in the morning, goes into an office and someone goes,
[2:55:17.960 --> 2:55:20.960]  this is what you're going to say today, Megan, okay?
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:21.960]  Stick to script.
[2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:24.960]  And by the way, they were handing her written printed out sheets.
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:27.960]  She had a notepad, but it was written stuff and then she'd go talk to them
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:30.960]  and then she'd come back and then she'd get it real wrong.
[2:55:30.960 --> 2:55:34.960]  She'd go, in court, your lawyer said and you admitted
[2:55:34.960 --> 2:55:37.960]  that you're nothing but an actor and it's all fake.
[2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:40.960]  Like Jack Nicholson and I go, no, that was in a pre-trial hearing
[2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:44.960]  three weeks before when they wanted to enter in to the trial,
[2:55:44.960 --> 2:55:46.960]  a video of me acting crazy as a joker.
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:48.960]  He said, my client's being an actor there.
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:51.960]  He doesn't mean he wants to really kill kids, your honor,
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:53.960]  but the news didn't give the full quote.
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:55.960]  He's like, your honor, when he says he wants to murder the children
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:55:59.960]  by giving them fluoride and vaccines, he's against vaccines, he's playing.
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:03.960]  They were using that and then we, yes, I was being an actor.
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:05.960]  I'm dressed up like the joker.
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:06.960]  It was satire.
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:09.960]  But it doesn't mean I'm being fake all the time.
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:11.960]  But again, she had it all scrambled.
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:12.960]  Somebody else had written it.
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:14.960]  They were handing her pieces of paper.
[2:56:14.960 --> 2:56:17.960]  Well, I've got a lot of friends that are mainstream reporters and stuff
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:20.960]  that sit on there and they tell me they're disgusted by it.
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:24.960]  They're waiting to get to a point where they can become financially stable
[2:56:24.960 --> 2:56:27.960]  to kind of move on and break off and work for something independent or alternative.
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:30.960]  That's a point Sernivish always makes when we're going to calls.
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:32.960]  He goes, Alex, you don't get it because he talks to reporters.
[2:56:32.960 --> 2:56:33.960]  I really don't.
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:34.960]  They all want to be us.
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:36.960]  They all are watching us to learn how to be free.
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:39.960]  I could name some names that you'd be shocked that taught, that talked to me
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:41.960]  and hit me up on Twitter and call me.
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:43.960]  And I'm just sitting there like, wow, like you seem like you're comfortable.
[2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:45.960]  Like you're happy with what you're doing.
[2:56:45.960 --> 2:56:48.960]  And they're just like, no, when that camera goes off and it's, we're done.
[2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:52.960]  I'm devastated because I know I just lied that I just, I said something
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:53.960]  that I don't truly believe in.
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:55.960]  It doesn't go with my values when I stand for.
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:59.960]  Oh yeah, they all look like, and they've even sent me screenshots of the scripts
[2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:03.960]  and I'll go like, and I know someone that works at NBC as well.
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:07.960]  And I'll get the same script and I'll turn on the TV and I can read it word for word.
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:11.960]  And I can, I could go to like, you know, pass someone or I could go to, you know,
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:14.960]  exactly you think it's, you think you're seeing, cause they know people still trust local.
[2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:15.960]  Most of that's pre-packaged.
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:17.960]  Oh, let's take a call here.
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:18.960]  I apologize.
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:19.960]  The callers were holding so long.
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:20.960]  Alan, Michigan.
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:21.960]  I'm going to go to Brian.
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:22.960]  Al, you're on the here.
[2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:23.960]  Welcome.
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:24.960]  Welcome.
[2:57:24.960 --> 2:57:26.960]  Nice to hear from you, Alex Jones.
[2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:28.960]  Thank you for calling in brother.
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:34.960]  Well, a month ago I got the living defend and went on the cleanse for a month.
[2:57:34.960 --> 2:57:40.960]  And the last week of the cleanse I threw in the oxypowder and I took advantage of
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:44.960]  your Memorial Day sale and got about 10 other products.
[2:57:44.960 --> 2:57:50.960]  And then I went to my doctor's physical and he recommended I don't take any of them.
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:57.960]  And I don't know why he says he's not sure what some of this stuff is.
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:57:59.960]  Well, there's probably no negative side effect.
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:03.960]  Well, this is a great example of how we don't screen calls and how our testimonials are real
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:04.960]  because this is a negative one.
[2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:05.960]  It's a unicorn.
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:06.960]  It's a very, very rare effect.
[2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:07.960]  Sure.
[2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:10.960]  We follow what they call FDA grass.
[2:58:10.960 --> 2:58:13.960]  That's the name of the law that was passed in the 90s.
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:17.960]  So it's only certified to be absolutely safe and good for you.
[2:58:17.960 --> 2:58:19.960]  So we only use grass ingredients.
[2:58:19.960 --> 2:58:23.960]  Then they're also tested and made by top labs in the country.
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:27.960]  Now, a lot of doctors say don't take supplements.
[2:58:27.960 --> 2:58:28.960]  That's part of the cult.
[2:58:28.960 --> 2:58:32.960]  You know, you see the ads on NBC for Prozac and, you know, whiskey.
[2:58:32.960 --> 2:58:33.960]  That's okay.
[2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:37.960]  But then don't take, you know, something like bio PQQ that the Japanese are obsessed with
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:41.960]  that's been proven to have nerve, you know, regrowth factor.
[2:58:41.960 --> 2:58:44.960]  So, but, but, but listen, I really appreciate your support.
[2:58:44.960 --> 2:58:46.960]  I'd like to come back to you here.
[2:58:46.960 --> 2:58:50.960]  Exactly what you're getting out of you can form a sentence.
[2:58:50.960 --> 2:58:56.960]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:58:57.960]  probiotic.

[3:00:20.960 --> 3:00:24.960]  Alright, the caller can get a sentence out without the music coming on or the break coming
[3:00:24.960 --> 3:00:25.960]  on or me interrupting.
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:26.960]  Let me get a word in edge wise.
[3:00:26.960 --> 3:00:27.960]  They'll be able to make this point.
[3:00:27.960 --> 3:00:28.960]  Is he being positive?
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:29.960]  Is he being negative?
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:30.960]  I don't know.
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:31.960]  I'm not rapping about the caller.
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:32.960]  He sounds like-
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:33.960]  I'm positive.
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:34.960]  No, no, no.
[3:00:34.960 --> 3:00:35.960]  Hold on.
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:36.960]  You sound like a great guy.
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:37.960]  I'm apologizing for the music and everything else cutting in.
[3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:38.960]  I went to your call too late.
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:39.960]  I was getting mad at the doctor, not you.
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:40.960]  I apologize.
[3:00:40.960 --> 3:00:41.960]  Go ahead.
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:44.960]  In 2005, my life changed.
[3:00:44.960 --> 3:00:47.960]  My parents felt I was depressed, so they took me to the doctor.
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:52.960]  They put me on pack, so that put me into a manic state.
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:58.960]  And so now I'm bipolar and I'm on six meds and I've had four hospitalizations.
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:01.960]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that, brother.
[3:01:01.960 --> 3:01:06.460]  So the doctor is more concerned about how they might react with my meds and I'm fine
[3:01:06.460 --> 3:01:07.460]  taking the meds.
[3:01:07.460 --> 3:01:10.960]  I can handle the chemical warfare.
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:12.660]  And I started listening.
[3:01:12.660 --> 3:01:15.640]  My last hospitalization was 2011.
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:22.960]  I started listening to you in 2012 and you really give a voice to people who feel like
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:26.960]  they're alone and think they're the only ones who aren't thinking these things.
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:30.360]  You really give a voice to those kind of people.
[3:01:30.360 --> 3:01:35.560]  You let them know they're not alone and that they can not feel like they have to do all
[3:01:35.560 --> 3:01:41.160]  the work of waking up everyone around them that there are people actually awake.
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:43.360]  Well, I appreciate you.
[3:01:43.360 --> 3:01:45.960]  You know, we just try our best to fund our operation with good things.
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:49.660]  So I got a chip in my shoulder sometimes when doctors criticize things.
[3:01:49.660 --> 3:01:53.960]  When I know for a fact that my finger got cut off, they reattached it.
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:02:00.560]  It didn't have all the feeling in it on one side until I took DNA force.
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:03.680]  And then literally in three months, it tangled, it hurt.
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:04.680]  The feeling came back.
[3:02:04.680 --> 3:02:07.800]  The problem is you start taking DNA force with the bio-PQQ.
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:09.960]  We have the true bio-PQQ, not the fake stuff.
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:11.360]  Ours is from an organic source.
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:13.960]  It doesn't mean it's organic because you can't certify it.
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:18.120]  It's a genetically engineered bacteria that make it, but the Japanese have the patent
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:20.160]  and you have really back pain and stuff that's gone away.
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:21.160]  You start taking it.
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:23.360]  Old injuries come back because it's actually healing.
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:26.760]  Now, you can actually say that about bio-PQQ, so it's amazing.
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:31.880]  What happened to you, though, on the supplements?
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:35.440]  I haven't been on them terribly too long to notice enough.
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:40.200]  The iodine I love, I would take it just for the taste, even if it did nothing.
[3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:41.600]  It tastes excellent.
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:45.920]  But I also wanted to talk about January 20th.
[3:02:45.920 --> 3:02:47.560]  I got what I wanted.
[3:02:47.560 --> 3:02:48.880]  Trump became president.
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:54.880]  I was an alcoholic for 10 years, and I quit drinking January 20th, and that's what made
[3:02:54.880 --> 3:02:56.360]  me start taking your supplements.
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:03:01.120]  I started spending the money that I would spend on alcohol on your supplement.
[3:03:01.120 --> 3:03:06.080]  Well, brother, congratulations, and if something's tasting good to you, that means you've probably
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  got a deficiency.
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:09.280]  When I've gotten enough of the iodine, it doesn't taste good.
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:11.320]  When I'm really needing it, it tastes really, really good.
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:14.240]  God bless you, and thank you for all your help, Al.
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:15.520]  All of you make this broadcast possible.
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:17.840]  Believe me, this is a very rare organization.
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:19.560]  The globals are very, very upset about it.
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:22.320]  They're very, very upset about what we're doing.
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:25.920]  Joe Biggs, in your gut, do you think Trump's going to survive?
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:26.920]  Yeah.
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:27.920]  You know, we're behind them.
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:28.920]  A lot of people are.
[3:03:28.920 --> 3:03:32.320]  I mean, I go out here on the streets, I talk to people, you'd be surprised.
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:37.520]  I was at a gas station yesterday, and some guy comes up to me and goes, hey, I like Trump.
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:40.480]  Now, there's behind every blade of grass.
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:42.120]  And we have to make it okay.
[3:03:42.120 --> 3:03:44.080]  I mean, here's the thing.
[3:03:44.080 --> 3:03:47.400]  We knew last year during the election cycle that they were hammering Trump.
[3:03:47.400 --> 3:03:49.560]  They were going after him hardcore on every little issue.
[3:03:49.560 --> 3:03:52.000]  The Russia thing's been there since the beginning.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:54.200]  We should just be used to that by now.
[3:03:54.200 --> 3:03:55.480]  Ignore it and move on.
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:03:58.640]  And that's one thing I want our president to understand is, hey, there's going to be
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:03:59.640]  bad stuff in the news.
[3:03:59.640 --> 3:04:00.720]  You already know that's going to happen.
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:04.000]  It happened last year when you were running to be president.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  Ignore it.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  Just do your agenda.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  He just knows it's pure crap.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  All he's doing is helping.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  Yeah, I know.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  I know.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:13.640]  And you know, when you have an ego, it bothers you because you know it's not true and you
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:14.640]  don't want to see it.
[3:04:14.640 --> 3:04:17.480]  But I just say my advice to him is to buckle down.
[3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:18.480]  Well, no, no.
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:21.440]  He's mad about it because he can't talk to any of his old friends.
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:26.520]  They say don't talk to a bunch of people because they say we're Russian agents and they mess
[3:04:26.520 --> 3:04:27.520]  with him.
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:30.800]  There are questions about it and he's like, are the Russians going to turn coal back on
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:35.080]  and boost the stock market $3 trillion and $300 billion in jobs and secure the border and
[3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:37.960]  return to military and try to fix the VA?
[3:04:37.960 --> 3:04:38.960]  It's not his ego.
[3:04:38.960 --> 3:04:39.960]  He's mad that these traders.
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:40.960]  He's going to do it.
[3:04:40.960 --> 3:04:41.960]  We're going to be fine.
[3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:43.460]  He has all the intel too.
[3:04:43.460 --> 3:04:44.460]  He knows that they were paid off.
[3:04:44.460 --> 3:04:47.360]  So he's telling sessions, arrest these people and you know, it's not happening.
[3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:50.840]  Hey, thank you so much, our last caller, O'Brien, Joseph, Eric.
[3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:51.840]  We're going to get to you.
[3:04:51.840 --> 3:04:52.840]  You're true troopers.
[3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:54.080]  And Mike Cernovich is coming in.
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:05:01.080]  He'll be hosting the Sour as we ride shotgun, infowars.com.
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:05.600]  Lost in the constant fake news cycle, we have forgotten the building tensions in Syria until
[3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:11.240]  this morning when news broke of a Syrian army plane being shot down by a United States F-18.
[3:05:11.240 --> 3:05:15.520]  This is the first Syrian aircraft to have been downed by the United States since 2011.
[3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:19.800]  Washington justified the strike, claiming the jet dropped bombs near US-backed forces
[3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:23.040]  while officials from Damascus said they were attacking ISIS.
[3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:27.760]  To be told, these are most likely the same group, but we should be asking John McCain
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:28.760]  that question.
[3:05:28.760 --> 3:05:34.360]  Russia has responded by saying it will now treat US aircraft operating in Syria as targets.
[3:05:34.360 --> 3:05:38.920]  President Trump can't get a microphone loud enough to ask for the Russia collusion investigation
[3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:39.920]  to be over.
[3:05:39.920 --> 3:05:43.960]  But don't hold your breath on the Democrats finding common sense and logic overnight.
[3:05:43.960 --> 3:05:47.400]  President Trump will still be investigated for collusion with Russia while they are threatening
[3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:49.240]  him and our country.
[3:05:49.240 --> 3:05:53.520]  President Trump, the globalists are trying to trap you and trick you into a war in Syria
[3:05:53.520 --> 3:05:56.480]  in hopes it will cost you the 2020 election.
[3:05:56.480 --> 3:05:57.480]  Don't fall for it.
[3:05:57.480 --> 3:05:58.480]  Make America great again.
[3:05:58.480 --> 3:06:00.920]  For infowars.com, this is Owen Shroyer.
[3:06:00.920 --> 3:06:05.280]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:06:05.280 --> 3:06:10.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:11.520]  to detoxify the body.
[3:06:11.520 --> 3:06:16.400]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:17.920]  It's made in the USA.
[3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:22.800]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:24.640]  the body and it supports the info war.
[3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:26.920]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:06:26.920 --> 3:06:31.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:06:31.400 --> 3:06:36.200]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:37.200]  get.
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:40.280]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[3:06:40.280 --> 3:06:45.320]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:06:45.320 --> 3:06:50.560]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:06:50.560 --> 3:06:53.240]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:56.560]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[3:06:56.560 --> 3:07:00.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:02.440]  Imrex Essentials, that's my middle name.
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:08.760]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[3:07:08.760 --> 3:07:14.200]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:15.200]  and high quality.
[3:07:15.200 --> 3:07:21.320]  Z Shield is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[3:07:21.320 --> 3:07:24.280]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[3:07:24.280 --> 3:07:28.760]  And they're such patriots they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[3:07:28.760 --> 3:07:32.720]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[3:07:32.720 --> 3:07:35.960]  son of a Rado ship, an additional 25% off.
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:37.040]  It's all there.
[3:07:37.040 --> 3:07:42.480]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game changing.
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:47.200]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Imrex Essentials and it's on
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:53.320]  average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from infowarstore.com.
[3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:57.720]  Help us win the info war while getting products everybody needs, infowarslife.com where you'll
[3:07:57.720 --> 3:08:16.400]  find the entire line of Imrex Essentials.
[3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:23.120]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:30.120]  the info war.
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:36.360]  Alright, Mike Sternovich and Joe Biggs are going to host this hour.
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:38.440]  Joe Biggs is going to be here Wednesday hosting.
[3:08:38.440 --> 3:08:42.960]  I'm going to take off tomorrow and the next day because all I think about is work, all
[3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:47.520]  I do is work and I'm just like a race car, I've got to turn the engine off at least
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:51.760]  for two days and make myself do that because my children want to go hiking and swimming
[3:08:51.760 --> 3:08:54.840]  and hanging out and they're off school right now so I'm going to do it, I'm going to not
[3:08:54.840 --> 3:08:58.400]  watch the news though it's impossible, I know you'll be tuned in but it's important for
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:05.280]  you as well to take time off too and not focus on this but also then when you are engaged
[3:09:05.280 --> 3:09:09.560]  be in the info war because it's exciting, it's fun but we all need balance but here's
[3:09:09.560 --> 3:09:11.080]  an example.
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:15.840]  We launched this three weeks ago, it was Mike Sternovich's idea, I put $200,000 I hardly
[3:09:15.840 --> 3:09:20.720]  have behind it saying CNN is ISIS because they keep backing Al Qaeda, they keep backing
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:25.880]  Arab Spring, they keep backing overthrowing Assad for these people and yeah, the second
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:33.880]  guy that got arrested last night, CNN is ISIS, he's going to win $2,500, wow, the highest
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:39.040]  level award is $200, $2,500, you usually have to get infowars.com out and do it in a legal
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:40.040]  and lawful area.
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:45.600]  I have to say, I cannot pay out to anybody else that rushes up on a stage or does something
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:51.040]  that they can claim violates private property, I'm doing this kind of posthumously because
[3:09:51.040 --> 3:09:54.600]  I'm saying do this where they're doing public video shoots or do this where they're talking
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:10:00.160]  to man on the street or call into C-SPAN or whatever you have to but posthumously and
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:04.320]  not that he's dead but after the event I can say that okay, you're going to get the award
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:10.040]  but going forward, anybody in Shakespeare in the park or any other event where it's
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:14.320]  private property, if you get up and speak out that's fine, I think rushing up on stage
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:18.600]  while I commend it, there become some liability issues if we sit there and say, now the left
[3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:22.400]  soul violent, George Soros is out there fighting groups saying kill cops, he gets away with
[3:10:22.400 --> 3:10:27.600]  it, I don't want violence and this could lead to that so I think this crosses the line.
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:31.080]  Now one side of me commend you and I think you're awesome and so I'm going to pay you
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:37.520]  $2,500, not for the contest but just in general for courage, okay but the contest, you've
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:40.960]  got to follow the laws, you've got to do it, there's ways to do it, the Bill Clinton's
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:45.960]  a rapist event, that was the model when these globalists go out to public events or Democrats
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:50.360]  have town halls, that's when you get up to the mic with your shirt, we sell the info
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:56.520]  wars, CNN is ISIS or you can do anything, you know the guy that caught CNN doing a
[3:10:56.520 --> 3:11:02.440]  fake video report in London, he gets $2,500 because that's what it's all about is rewarding
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:07.400]  you for what you've done, you're not doing it for money, I never knew this guy, this
[3:11:07.400 --> 3:11:14.120]  wasn't premeditated but it's about recognizing and basically applauding the great service
[3:11:14.120 --> 3:11:18.480]  they've done in the info war, the Democrats are saying murder everybody, kill Trump, all
[3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:22.080]  we're saying is stop the violence, stop the violence like Ted Nugent said.
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:25.960]  It's dangerous because what this play is doing, this is telling people it's okay to
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:30.120]  speak like that, it's okay to run around and say hey let's go kill the president.
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:32.160]  They're sharing the simulated murder.
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:36.040]  And I say this for a reason because my good friend and I went out, he took me out Saturday
[3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:39.360]  night for fathers there or whatever and he goes hey let's go hang out, let's get outside
[3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:42.200]  of the place, you know you're taking care of the baby all day, let's go hang out.
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:45.880]  So we go to this place called Moon Tower Saloon and there was a group of three or four girls
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:51.880]  probably 25 to 30 and they see my shirt and they figure out I'm a Trump guy and they go
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:56.920]  oh my god we have a Trump supporter, I'm gonna kill that mother and they just start going
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:01.080]  oh yeah I'd like to kill him too, I'd like to see him dead and it's funny because you
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:04.440]  see these liberal news sources coming out saying oh this play is it promoting that,
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:07.120]  it's not gonna have an effect on people out there.
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:10.760]  Well the rest of the media is saying kill everybody, it's clearly Trump, American flags,
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:16.600]  orange hair, he has the Eastern European wife, it looks like Melania, it's a total plan.
[3:12:16.600 --> 3:12:20.280]  By the way we have the video with the audio, let's go ahead and roll that right now and
[3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:21.280]  we'll go to your calls.
[3:12:21.280 --> 3:12:37.520]  Amazing, okay it's $2,500, amazing and notice how they tackle him, I've never seen a left
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:41.520]  wing, if that had happened at a Trump rally and they tackled him like this, that would
[3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:43.160]  be the biggest story in the world.
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:47.640]  It'd be Trump violent thugs even on their own WikiLeaks saying go be violent, go kick
[3:12:47.640 --> 3:12:51.920]  people in the leg so it's not on tape, have them hit you, whoever this guy is, and by
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:55.360]  the way we're not just gonna have awards, some people here who want awards end up being
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:12:58.720]  reporters for us, these are the type of folks we want that have this courage.
[3:12:58.720 --> 3:13:02.240]  Yeah that's what I've been telling, so his name is Saul and he's a proud boy, he's friends
[3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:07.120]  with Gavin McInnes and he went into that, so Gavin texted me that photo earlier, but
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:11.960]  yeah I love how he gets tackled even though he wasn't violent, that should be a big story,
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:13.080]  the media is a double standard.
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:14.080]  I love Gavin McInnes.
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:19.680]  Yeah, so this is to an audition, people always say I wanna work for you, how do I get, get
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:23.600]  me down, see me say go where's your portfolio, why aren't you in the field doing news, why
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:28.840]  aren't you out there every day doing videos, doing podcasts, doing blogs, raising awareness
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:32.960]  like Saul did, like Laura Loomer did, there's nothing stopping anyone here who's listening
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:34.240]  and they're doing the info work.
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:37.480]  It's free to open up a YouTube account, it's free to start a Twitter, it's free to start
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:41.920]  a Facebook, all you need now is a phone with a camera and the balls to go out there and
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:42.920]  do it.
[3:13:42.920 --> 3:13:45.880]  I've been being pushed around, okay these guys have been holding so long, that's why
[3:13:45.880 --> 3:13:49.200]  I crashed into the shower that certain of us is here hosting and again, I do everything
[3:13:49.200 --> 3:13:54.000]  I say I'm gonna do, but I can tell Joe Biggs had so much energy, he was doing so much stuff
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:58.840]  that I just said Joe, you need to go do your own thing and once that's successful, which
[3:13:58.840 --> 3:14:02.600]  I thought it would be, I said then I'm gonna launch some big stuff down the road, hopefully
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:05.520]  you can come back and synergistically work with us, so you're doing your own thing on
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:09.320]  your own show and now Joe's to that point, he's been successful, so now he's back,
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:13.000]  he's been taking care of his baby the last few months, which I've just done with another
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:16.600]  newborn, I know how it is, the fourth force in the family, a true blessing and my children
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:23.080]  are with me, fake news is all lying about that, but I'm about to launch a TV slash network,
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:29.720]  but the base will be affiliates, Talk Radio and these affiliates love us, have over 200,
[3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:34.760]  I guarantee you they are so ready, our affiliates to pick up you guys on hundreds of stations
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:39.160]  I think right away, this is gonna be so huge and then we'll go viral over the internet
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:43.200]  and the live streams and when the audiences all get behind this, we're not in competition
[3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:47.040]  with the rebel, we're not in competition with the compound media, you can have all those
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:51.520]  guys on, you can have shows on there if you want, I don't care, I want to build a mass
[3:14:51.520 --> 3:14:56.360]  of awakened people that focus like a laser beam and take down the NWO and it's about
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:14:57.360]  to happen.
[3:14:57.360 --> 3:15:00.960]  Well and it's like that article in the Washington Post said, even though it's a little bit negative,
[3:15:00.960 --> 3:15:05.120]  they go, we're drowning out the media with sheer volume, towards the bottom of the article,
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:07.120]  they go, we, they admit that we're winning.
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:09.360]  That show, that's with the champagne.
[3:15:09.360 --> 3:15:12.840]  Yeah, so there's this champagne toasting of course with the Andrew Torba and somebody
[3:15:12.840 --> 3:15:18.520]  actually again, a liberal journalist had commented that they had to try out the Crip Keeper Tom
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:22.120]  Brokaw or Tom Rather, whatever his name is, meanwhile.
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:25.120]  Yeah, rolling out some liar to call me a racist.
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:26.120]  Yeah, that's the future.
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:28.120]  Something like the KKK wants to kill me.
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:31.320]  Well think about like I said earlier, there's so many journalists out there who are established
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:35.560]  right now in the media that hate their lives, they hate doing what they're doing but they're
[3:15:35.560 --> 3:15:38.840]  trying to get that money, they're trying to get that bankroll so they can you know kind
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:42.480]  of secure an area where they can go and do what they want to do and he launched a network
[3:15:42.480 --> 3:15:43.480]  like that.
[3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:45.000]  You're going to, you're going to be surprised at the amount of people that are going to
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  go.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:48.680]  They even admit that if you watch Jones for a week, watch out, he'll have you, he'll have
[3:15:48.680 --> 3:15:51.680]  you believe in you.
[3:15:51.680 --> 3:15:52.680]  Exactly.
[3:15:52.680 --> 3:15:53.680]  It's ridiculous.
[3:15:53.680 --> 3:15:55.680]  You read these articles, you can see like they're going as far as they can without
[3:15:55.680 --> 3:15:56.680]  getting fired.
[3:15:56.680 --> 3:16:00.960]  Yeah, well they admit that this is more fun what we do.
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:03.520]  They're younger people, they love the streaming content.
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:08.080]  You know they're at work, they're listening in, they watch it, they don't like the edited
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:09.080]  crap.
[3:16:09.080 --> 3:16:13.080]  And they want to be in control but they just, they want to be running their own media operation.
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:14.320]  It doesn't mean they even agree with us.
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:17.400]  Did you see the rest of the Meg and Kelly show last night?
[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:18.400]  It was boring.
[3:16:18.400 --> 3:16:19.400]  It was boring.
[3:16:19.400 --> 3:16:22.840]  I'm not against old people, I love old folks but did you notice that it was like a geriatric
[3:16:22.840 --> 3:16:23.840]  home for fake journalists?
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:26.840]  No, it was like a guy standing in San Francisco but it didn't even look like it was actually
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:30.000]  San Francisco, like it was a green screen, it was some old decrepit dude and it was just
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:33.720]  boring and then they go to the Sam Neil or whatever, the guy from Jurassic Park and they're
[3:16:33.720 --> 3:16:37.040]  in New Zealand talking about wine, like I don't care about that.
[3:16:37.040 --> 3:16:40.280]  There's a home network for that, I mean what the hell, like we're actually sending people
[3:16:40.280 --> 3:16:41.280]  in the field.
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:42.280]  We're actually going to-
[3:16:42.280 --> 3:16:43.920]  You've got your great act of charity quotes but it's true.
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:47.720]  Yeah, and that's the thing that a lot of people realizing too and you know I don't want to
[3:16:47.720 --> 3:16:52.600]  throw shade on Breitbart or whatever but the younger people are realizing now that media
[3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:56.760]  is going to be based around your personality, around your personal brand, around your identity
[3:16:56.760 --> 3:17:00.720]  and the old byline, oh I'm on NBC, therefore you're going to take me seriously, all that
[3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:05.480]  is dead, the brand is dead, the Washington Post brand is not trusted, the New York Times
[3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:09.440]  brand is not trusted, so all these young people are tuning in, these journalists even though
[3:17:09.440 --> 3:17:14.560]  they disagree with us and think we're whatever, they're saying I want to have my own brand,
[3:17:14.560 --> 3:17:15.560]  my own audience-
[3:17:15.560 --> 3:17:19.800]  By the way, good job for Sean Hannity, he said hey, release the whole tape, it's obviously
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:20.800]  cover up.
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:21.800]  Right.
[3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:22.800]  Wait till we do.
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:25.800]  The problem is people say that, that's a lot to release.
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:32.800]  And don't do it, don't subject anybody to have to listen to Megyn Kelly any longer.
[3:17:32.800 --> 3:17:36.400]  The corpse is gone, it's right there, we've autopsyed her.
[3:17:36.400 --> 3:17:39.640]  I mean, I wonder how long it's going to be before they just can her, if not, but I mean
[3:17:39.640 --> 3:17:43.160]  I said I was going to release it, I have to, let's do a little bit here and there.
[3:17:43.160 --> 3:17:51.280]  Dude, look at Jesse Ventura, I like Jesse, Governor Vindra, he has a show on Raw Story
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:53.320]  about how Dick Cheney's evil.
[3:17:53.320 --> 3:17:58.800]  Tell us something we don't know, man, cover what's happening currently, and then JFK,
[3:17:58.800 --> 3:18:02.200]  they killed him, we didn't know that.
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:08.320]  I'm down in Mexico right now, Alex, okay, I was the governor of Minnesota.
[3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:12.440]  I was a Navy SEAL, I was the original Frogman.
[3:18:12.440 --> 3:18:15.160]  Too many people living in the past, I mean you even hear this with a lot of people in
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:19.120]  journalism like, well I knew Andrew Breitbart, and I'm like, well okay, cool story bro, what
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:22.600]  have you done, what have you done this past week, well Andrew Breitbart was a friend of
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:23.600]  mine, therefore you should listen to me.
[3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:28.080]  But let's talk about the real MVP, it'll skip this break and the one of 50 because we can
[3:18:28.080 --> 3:18:32.600]  do that, and I've got to go to O'Brien and Joseph and Eric, I promise I'm going to them.
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:37.400]  Drudge has been the quiet kingmaker in all this because Drudge, early on, mainstream alternative
[3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:41.720]  government docs, foreign news, he would link to whatever he thought was interesting and
[3:18:41.720 --> 3:18:46.120]  actually gave oxygen to things early on, and look, he's covering the important news, Russia
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:51.440]  vows to shoot down all flying objects over Syria, warns USA, yeah that's a US, Russia
[3:18:51.440 --> 3:18:56.640]  now in Cuban Missile Crisis level, showdown, because criminal elements inside the Pentagon
[3:18:56.640 --> 3:19:01.720]  want to start a larger war to take control from Trump, so they're using his biggest strength
[3:19:01.720 --> 3:19:05.080]  that he loves the military as his weakness, so he's put the military in charge, you know
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:10.520]  I learned early on before it was in the news, Trump walked in on January 20th, he went to
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:16.120]  the CIA, remember that was the first place he went, and he said, give me all the list
[3:19:16.120 --> 3:19:20.680]  of targets you already called to be hit, they said, here they are sir, and he said, I don't
[3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:24.880]  want to look at them, hit them all, and they did, and so that's a strength that he's delegating
[3:19:24.880 --> 3:19:30.840]  and a promise, so he's in control, but then they can use that as ways to then insert things
[3:19:30.840 --> 3:19:35.800]  like a Bay of Pigs on Kennedy that was a mission where they set Kennedy up by blowing the mission
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:40.320]  to make the president look bad, exactly, Mad Dog Madness is going to annihilate ISIS,
[3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:45.440]  I just know that, well they've already basically annihilated them at least in Iraq and Syria,
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:48.680]  but what I'm saying is they've moved Marines and heavy artillery in that you don't use
[3:19:48.680 --> 3:19:52.800]  on ISIS show, you know that you're an artillery go, so I mean, you know they're pushing to
[3:19:52.800 --> 3:20:00.660]  go after Damascus, World War III, we all know the gameplay, yeah they're manipulating
[3:20:00.660 --> 3:20:06.120]  intelligence supports already, and nothing can be trusted, Trump delegated a lot, there
[3:20:06.120 --> 3:20:10.400]  will be a Gulf of Tonkin style incident to drag us into another one, well they're trying
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:14.920]  right now, and by the way you heard sitcom calling in and all the rest of it, I mean
[3:20:14.920 --> 3:20:20.360]  I have my sources, they say no one in the CIA, no one in defense intelligence, nobody
[3:20:20.360 --> 3:20:24.920]  in the northern command, southern command, space command, the rank and follow even the
[3:20:24.920 --> 3:20:28.960]  officers are against it, except for a few weird old generals on the top, and most of
[3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:35.400]  them don't want this happen, so that's the globalist big problem, what do you think?
[3:20:35.400 --> 3:20:38.400]  I think it's going to be interesting, I think that there will be something that's pulled
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:44.200]  to try to get us to go into war, but you know at the end of the day, you know, Mad Dog Madness
[3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:46.960]  has a pretty good record, I'm hoping that he's going to stick to his guns, he's going
[3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:52.240]  to stick to doing the right thing, and focus merely on destroying those ISIS elements that
[3:20:52.240 --> 3:20:53.240]  are out there, those pockets of-
[3:20:53.240 --> 3:20:57.080]  I agree, so why are we blowing up armored columns, and why are we shooting down Syrian
[3:20:57.080 --> 3:20:58.080]  planes?
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:00.720]  That's, that kind of shady stuff is what's going on front of us.
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:04.480]  I mean should we be sharing Syrian pilots with, you know, they got shorter beards than
[3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:06.560]  you, and they're like the women can go to college, and-
[3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:07.560]  Yeah.
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:14.160]  Well, again, they are manipulating intelligence supports, that's again McMaster, he wants to
[3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:16.560]  want this war, all he understands is armor.
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:22.000]  He doesn't understand the information war, he understands drop armor, drop howitzers,
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:25.800]  let's bring in tanks, let's destroy more homes, and that's what they want, Petraeus
[3:21:25.800 --> 3:21:28.800]  wants it of course too, because he makes all the money in the country.
[3:21:28.800 --> 3:21:32.320]  Well, I don't want to war with Saudi Arabia, but I mean Syria's not been our business,
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:36.760]  Saudi Arabia has been up our, our rear end, we want to use some howitzers and stuff, how
[3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:37.760]  about on them?
[3:21:37.760 --> 3:21:40.760]  Oh, I would love to go to war with Saudi Arabia, no, I've, I've said that that's one
[3:21:40.760 --> 3:21:44.680]  war I would support, let's go to Saudi Arabia, take the oil, I would 100% support a war
[3:21:44.680 --> 3:21:45.680]  with Saudi Arabia.
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:48.200]  Well, I mean, I'm just saying, they're the ones attacking everybody.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:49.200]  Well, the same-
[3:21:49.200 --> 3:21:50.720]  And people say, well, then what's Trump going over there?
[3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:54.440]  They were kissing his ass when he got there, because he went into their place and said,
[3:21:54.440 --> 3:21:55.440]  you better stop it.
[3:21:55.440 --> 3:21:58.880]  Well, the same criminal elements that are still within the military, the same people
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:03.240]  that are there under Obama, the same ones that could have taken those strikes, those
[3:22:03.240 --> 3:22:07.880]  different maneuvers that take out ISIS when they were convoying into Iraq and slowly taking
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:08.880]  over those-
[3:22:08.880 --> 3:22:10.880]  Oh, no, that was an Obama invasion.
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:15.280]  Yeah, I mean, we could have taken that out with what's called successive bracketing and
[3:22:15.280 --> 3:22:18.520]  just taken out that first vehicle, then the last vehicle, and then fire for effect through
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:19.520]  the middle.
[3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:20.680]  And it would have been done.
[3:22:20.680 --> 3:22:22.640]  That would have sent a clear and present, like-
[3:22:22.640 --> 3:22:26.440]  They've got 10,000 predator drones, 2,000 in that theater.
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:30.880]  They don't, but it's just like the same reason drug companies don't want to cure cancer.
[3:22:30.880 --> 3:22:33.880]  You don't want to end the war, because if you end the war, then how do you justify-
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:34.880]  I do.
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:36.480]  I want to end Orthodox Islam.
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:39.600]  Well, we don't want war, but we're not making trouble-
[3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:40.600]  No, no, no.
[3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:41.600]  I agree.
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:42.600]  I'm saying I want to end it.
[3:22:42.600 --> 3:22:43.840]  Yeah, but we're patriots.
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:45.000]  We're not the deep state.
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:49.640]  The deep state wants a never-ending war, because it allows them to murder more people, murder
[3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:50.640]  more children.
[3:22:50.640 --> 3:22:52.760]  It allows them to traffic more children.
[3:22:52.760 --> 3:22:58.000]  It's a big cover, as we all know, a lot of these wars are a big cover for human trafficking.
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:02.240]  And so that's why every time you have a war, they're able to go in and buy more slaves
[3:23:02.240 --> 3:23:03.240]  on the open markets.
[3:23:03.240 --> 3:23:04.880]  Well, that's what's happening in Missour right now.
[3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:07.160]  Like I said, I've got buddies over in Missour right now.
[3:23:07.160 --> 3:23:09.880]  They're called the Free Burma Rangers.
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:13.640]  And that's literally their mission right there, is rescuing women and children from
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:17.440]  being held in captivity and sold off into human trafficking as sex slaves.
[3:23:17.440 --> 3:23:21.480]  Well, look how we knew this a year ago, but now it's confirmed, mainstream news, tens
[3:23:21.480 --> 3:23:25.800]  of thousands of women and children a month are being loaded on boats in Tripoli, grabbed
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:29.840]  out of the country by the Islamists that run it now, and are being sold on the open market.
[3:23:29.840 --> 3:23:34.840]  I've got footage of women carrying their babies running in fear from radical Islam, from
[3:23:34.840 --> 3:23:39.640]  Sharia law in Western Missour, trying to flee to Erbil while they're being sniped in the
[3:23:39.640 --> 3:23:43.920]  head, dropping their babies, and then Americans coming over running, grabbing those babies,
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:44.920]  dragging them.
[3:23:44.920 --> 3:23:45.920]  Oh yeah, I saw the footage.
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:48.000]  I couldn't believe CNN actually aired it, but they don't, they can be visual.
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  Yeah, they filmed my buddies.
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  Those are the ones.
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:51.000]  Guys, pull up.
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  What's the name of the video?
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:54.520]  It's Man Saves Child under Sniper Attack.
[3:23:54.520 --> 3:23:56.520]  Yeah, it was the Free Burma Rangers.
[3:23:56.520 --> 3:23:57.520]  But yeah, that's it.
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:23:59.520]  Well, during the break, I saw that footage.
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:00.520]  Wow.
[3:24:00.520 --> 3:24:01.520]  Yeah, those are my buddies.
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:02.520]  I can't believe that CNN actually showed it.
[3:24:02.520 --> 3:24:03.520]  No, no, I was shocked too.
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:04.520]  It came out last year.
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:06.080]  No, people don't know who's who.
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:09.480]  They're like, look at these brave people saving someone in the Civil War.
[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:14.600]  They don't explain they're fighting the group that our own government brought in, and that
[3:24:14.600 --> 3:24:17.320]  Trump is the one letting them in to save the girl.
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:20.440]  It should be Trump's soldiers save girl.
[3:24:20.440 --> 3:24:23.600]  I'm meeting with these guys in Waco and a few weeks he's given a speech, and I'm trying
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:24.920]  to find out a plan of...
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:27.120]  I was about to say, you almost went over there about a year ago.
[3:24:27.120 --> 3:24:28.920]  Yeah, but then we had to go to the RNC and the DNC.
[3:24:28.920 --> 3:24:30.840]  It was right at that same time, so I ended up pushing it off.
[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:34.600]  So now I have an opportunity, again, to meet with this guy here in the state.
[3:24:34.600 --> 3:24:38.320]  Yeah, there is an incredible moment, aid worker, spreads 150 yards to the gunfire to save
[3:24:38.320 --> 3:24:39.320]  girl.
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:41.600]  They call him an aid worker to make it seem like it's a U.N. aid thing, though.
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:43.840]  No, no, it's a U.S. soldier.
[3:24:43.840 --> 3:24:49.640]  He is a ex-U.S. Army Ranger who has his wife there, his 10-year-old daughter there, his
[3:24:49.640 --> 3:24:54.200]  6-year-old son, and another daughter, I can't remember her age, and they all live in her
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  Bill Iraq.
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:24:56.200]  That's a total commitment.
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:24:57.200]  Yeah.
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:24:58.960]  They've been there for going on two years.
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:24:59.960]  That's him right there.
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:03.400]  No, I remember, we were talking to him a year ago, and I was going to maybe help fund
[3:25:03.400 --> 3:25:04.400]  to have you go there.
[3:25:04.400 --> 3:25:05.400]  Yeah.
[3:25:05.400 --> 3:25:06.400]  And then it didn't.
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:07.400]  I want to do that.
[3:25:07.400 --> 3:25:08.400]  I'm going to.
[3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:09.400]  I'm looking to do it.
[3:25:09.400 --> 3:25:10.400]  I remember, that's the guy.
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:11.400]  Meanwhile, I'm like, I've heard of those guys.
[3:25:11.400 --> 3:25:12.640]  Dave Eubank is his name.
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:13.640]  Yeah.
[3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:14.640]  Let's go back to that.
[3:25:14.640 --> 3:25:15.640]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:16.640]  Stand on the left.
[3:25:16.640 --> 3:25:20.280]  And that's his little daughter in the back, in the camo, in the D.C.U.
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:24.560]  And that's a little, I think, I can't remember if it was like a little ZD girl or whatever.
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:27.320]  People don't know that veterans are bringing their families into this.
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:28.320]  Wow, that's amazing.
[3:25:28.320 --> 3:25:33.680]  I mean, there's my buddy was just over there, Joel, and he has footage of these girls taming
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:38.160]  like wild Arabian horses and breaking them in like this little girl out there.
[3:25:38.160 --> 3:25:39.160]  I mean, she's going to grow up.
[3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:40.640]  She's the opposite of some TV head.
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:42.680]  And why, why does it make and Kelly cover this?
[3:25:42.680 --> 3:25:46.560]  Why doesn't it, you know, yeah, the story is, is it patriots are bringing their kids
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:49.240]  because there's no teleprompter in the school?
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:53.480]  Why don't they go there and do a positive segment and showing people the truth?
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:57.680]  Well, because their owners won't let them do that, of course.
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:25:59.000]  That's the evil we're up against.
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:03.640]  Yeah, I can't talk about a lot of this, but as you know, they're by brigades and brigades
[3:26:03.640 --> 3:26:08.240]  of former U.S. soldiers actually in Africa and in the Middle East, actually saving the
[3:26:08.240 --> 3:26:11.800]  families right now from slaughter and then try to actually get them out.
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:14.320]  And under Obama, he was blocking them getting out.
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:17.640]  He only lets military aged men come in that have Wahhabist passports.
[3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:19.680]  Well, there's a lot of guys that were contractors.
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:22.360]  I mean, those guys, if you, if you, if you worked hard, you stayed over there for a long
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:25.880]  period of time, you could really get a nice bankroll, save a lot of money.
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:27.720]  And now these guys are not contractors.
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:30.480]  They're going over there on their own dime just because they think it's the right thing
[3:26:30.480 --> 3:26:31.480]  to do.
[3:26:31.480 --> 3:26:32.480]  They know it's the right thing to do.
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:35.160]  And they're going out there and establishing a system on how to pull these women and children
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:39.640]  out and keep them from being sold as human slaves and sex trafficking and all that.
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:40.880]  Because it's a huge problem, like he said.
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:43.160]  And again, this is the story.
[3:26:43.160 --> 3:26:45.160]  We should, the whole show should have been about this.
[3:26:45.160 --> 3:26:46.160]  It's just incredible.
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:47.160]  All right.
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:49.680]  O'Brien and Marilyn, you're on the air about Meg and Kelly than Joseph and Eric.
[3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:51.200]  I apologize for you holding so long.
[3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:52.200]  Go ahead.
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:59.000]  Well, pretty much, if I was, if I had my own champagne glass, I'd be, I'd be chairing
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  you all with you.
[3:27:00.000 --> 3:27:05.080]  But what I think, what you did back there was pretty, pretty good.
[3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:09.560]  Even though the whole thing blew up in your face, I mean, not, not to say your face.
[3:27:09.560 --> 3:27:11.120]  I mean, Kelly's face.
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:18.400]  I mean, the whole thing just, just didn't even, didn't even get in, get in and-
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:20.440]  Sure, your phone's breaking up a bit, but I agree.
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:22.600]  I got blown up.
[3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:23.600]  She got blown up.
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:24.600]  I mean, I think overall though, she got defeated.
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:25.600]  What do you think?
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:26.600]  Yeah.
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:27.600]  Big time.
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:29.080]  I mean, she came into your house.
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:32.760]  She came in here thinking that she could pull, you know, something over your eyes and play
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:33.960]  this whole game.
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:36.320]  You know, we've been around the block a few times.
[3:27:36.320 --> 3:27:37.800]  You've been on many, on many things.
[3:27:37.800 --> 3:27:39.200]  I'll still say I look like hell though.
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:40.720]  I mean, she edited that up.
[3:27:40.720 --> 3:27:43.880]  Thank you, O'Brien, where it was indistinguishable from what I said.
[3:27:43.880 --> 3:27:47.360]  I mean, literally, you know, a two hour sit down, of course, a few times I squirmed or
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:48.360]  whatever.
[3:27:48.360 --> 3:27:49.360]  It was indistinguishable.
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:50.720]  It wasn't what I said.
[3:27:50.720 --> 3:27:52.240]  It's tricky editing.
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:54.240]  We already know that's what we're going to do.
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:27:55.240]  Not enough people watched it.
[3:27:55.240 --> 3:27:57.240]  You know, she's just irrelevant.
[3:27:57.240 --> 3:27:58.240]  I know, but-
[3:27:58.240 --> 3:27:59.240]  YouTube videos.
[3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:00.240]  3.5 million people watched it.
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:02.240]  They said, I reach that in a day on Twitter if I'm bored.
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:03.240]  I know.
[3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:04.240]  That's a fun board.
[3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:05.240]  I know.
[3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:07.240]  A couple tweets a day.
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:09.240]  Hey, Joseph and Oregon, go ahead.
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:12.240]  Next, how's it going?
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:13.240]  Thanks, brother.
[3:28:13.240 --> 3:28:14.240]  Go ahead.
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:15.240]  Yeah.
[3:28:15.240 --> 3:28:20.200]  Well, first of all, congratulations on having Megan Kelly blow up in her face.
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:21.680]  I thought that was hilarious.
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:22.680]  Thank you.
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:28.240]  What I wanted to bring to light is actually something, well, thanks to you, I actually
[3:28:28.240 --> 3:28:31.960]  started digging in deep to things that most people wouldn't think of.
[3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:36.480]  And I actually started researching and I came across an interesting thing that you may or
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:38.600]  may not know about.
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:50.920]  It was an ex-KGB agent named Yuri Bezmanov who actually defected from the Soviet Union
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:52.720]  in the 1970s.
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:58.720]  And in 1984, he gave an interview and he actually talked about everything that's going on and
[3:28:58.720 --> 3:29:05.320]  it's called ideological subversion and everything that you see going on in the US and the UK
[3:29:05.320 --> 3:29:06.320]  and the Europe.
[3:29:06.320 --> 3:29:07.320]  Sure.
[3:29:07.320 --> 3:29:08.800]  You're a griffin, right?
[3:29:08.800 --> 3:29:10.600]  Yeah, I believe so.
[3:29:10.600 --> 3:29:11.600]  Yeah.
[3:29:11.600 --> 3:29:12.600]  That's powerful.
[3:29:12.600 --> 3:29:13.600]  That's documented.
[3:29:13.600 --> 3:29:17.920]  And that was globalist programming that we put on Russia and then it just came back
[3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:18.920]  at us.
[3:29:18.920 --> 3:29:19.920]  That's why we say, what?
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:29.040]  This looks so familiar and that's because that's what the globalist cooked up for everybody.
[3:29:29.040 --> 3:29:31.720]  We think we won the Soviet Union or the Cold War.
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:35.720]  In fact, the Cold War came around and came back on us equally without us even realizing
[3:29:35.720 --> 3:29:37.720]  that we're having a deal of the after effect.
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:40.720]  You want to add more to that, Joseph?
[3:29:40.720 --> 3:29:43.400]  No, I think I got everything I know.
[3:29:43.400 --> 3:29:44.400]  God bless you, brother.
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:45.400]  Yeah, that's a powerful interview.
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:46.400]  Everybody should watch it.
[3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:47.400]  It's ideology.
[3:29:47.400 --> 3:29:48.400]  Not where you're from.
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:49.400]  It's ideology.
[3:29:49.400 --> 3:29:51.280]  We're on the march.
[3:29:51.280 --> 3:29:53.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:53.680 --> 3:29:57.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:57.480 --> 3:30:05.360]  Well, the left is getting a taste of its own medicine on Friday night, Laura Loomer rushed
[3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:09.240]  the stage of the New York public disgrace theater showing of Caesar, which should really
[3:30:09.240 --> 3:30:12.800]  be called Trump, a play depicting the assassination of President Trump.
[3:30:12.800 --> 3:30:17.240]  She rushed the stage insinuating the blood of Steve Scalise and others is on their hands
[3:30:17.240 --> 3:30:22.120]  as well as mainstream television news, which has fanned the flames of fake news and hatred.
[3:30:22.120 --> 3:30:26.480]  While she was being arrested, Jack Pasobic went live on Twitter to broadcast the event
[3:30:26.480 --> 3:30:30.760]  and then went on to tell all the brainwashed liberals in the audience that Joseph Goebbels
[3:30:30.760 --> 3:30:34.080]  would be proud of this production and that they were Nazis.
[3:30:34.080 --> 3:30:37.920]  While the left is having side effects of outrage to their own medicine, even allies in the
[3:30:37.920 --> 3:30:40.480]  Trump movement have been at odds over the protest.
[3:30:40.480 --> 3:30:45.240]  Regardless, the very next night, more protesters took the stage, shouting Goebbels would be
[3:30:45.240 --> 3:30:47.360]  proud, CNN is ISIS.
[3:30:47.360 --> 3:30:51.520]  While the protesters were all arrested, rumor has it some of the police involved support
[3:30:51.520 --> 3:30:55.680]  the protest against the expression of hatred and violence demonstrated by the New York
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:57.680]  Public Theater against our president.
[3:30:57.680 --> 3:31:00.960]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:31:00.960 --> 3:31:04.960]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[3:31:04.960 --> 3:31:10.080]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:14.120]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[3:31:14.120 --> 3:31:18.480]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[3:31:18.480 --> 3:31:23.800]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:30.200]  Remember and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:31:30.200 --> 3:31:35.320]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[3:31:35.320 --> 3:31:37.440]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[3:31:37.440 --> 3:31:41.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[3:31:41.640 --> 3:31:44.320]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[3:31:44.320 --> 3:31:48.680]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed
[3:31:48.680 --> 3:31:52.240]  available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[3:31:52.240 --> 3:31:57.200]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[3:31:57.200 --> 3:32:02.240]  my favorite coffee, available at infowarslife.com.
[3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:06.080]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[3:32:06.080 --> 3:32:10.960]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[3:32:10.960 --> 3:32:13.760]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:32:13.760 --> 3:32:20.040]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:22.560]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[3:32:22.560 --> 3:32:26.800]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[3:32:26.800 --> 3:32:31.520]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[3:32:31.520 --> 3:32:32.520]  vitality.
[3:32:32.520 --> 3:32:36.560]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:40.160]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[3:32:40.160 --> 3:32:48.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[3:32:48.000 --> 3:32:51.280]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[3:32:51.280 --> 3:32:54.160]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[3:32:54.160 --> 3:32:59.040]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[3:32:59.040 --> 3:33:20.040]  with Anthroplex.
[3:33:20.040 --> 3:33:37.640]  Recently, we've been observing leftist fantasizing about Trump assassinations and hate-filled
[3:33:37.640 --> 3:33:42.240]  rhetoric of the left inspiring real attacks on political adversaries.
[3:33:42.240 --> 3:33:47.400]  But now we have come to a new low as self-proclaimed counter-terrorist expert and friend of Kathy
[3:33:47.400 --> 3:33:53.640]  Griffin and Russian conspiracy theorist, Malcolm Nance, has apparently decided to start choosing
[3:33:53.640 --> 3:33:57.360]  targets for ISIS suicide bombers.
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:02.280]  In a recent tweet that has since been deleted, Malcolm Nance said in reference to the Trump
[3:34:02.280 --> 3:34:11.880]  Tower in Istanbul, this is my nominee for first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property.
[3:34:11.880 --> 3:34:21.360]  He wasn't warning against a possible attack, he was nominating it to be the first attack.
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:27.400]  When you nominate a candidate for president, you willfully and carefully choose that candidate
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:29.720]  and hope they get elected.
[3:34:29.720 --> 3:34:34.440]  Does that mean that Malcolm Nance willfully and carefully chose this target with the
[3:34:34.440 --> 3:34:37.520]  hopes that ISIS would attack?
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:42.520]  And Malcolm should know that ISIS can be motivated by speech because he certainly seemed to think
[3:34:42.520 --> 3:34:48.240]  so when he said that if Trump got elected, that his speech would somehow radicalize the
[3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:55.120]  1.6 billion so-called moderate Muslims around the world into joining ISIS.
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:01.880]  They want someone to go off into space and inflame the other 1.6 billion Muslims so that
[3:35:01.880 --> 3:35:06.240]  they can come off the fence and join ISIS and other groups.
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:09.080]  For Cirovich Media, I'm Devon Stack.
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:12.600]  Man, your videos are great, that's a great team you've got.
[3:35:12.600 --> 3:35:16.440]  Yeah, they're amazing guys and of course that segues into an article too where Scott
[3:35:16.440 --> 3:35:20.880]  Pelle who tried to go against me on 60 Minutes said that the congressional shooting was in
[3:35:20.880 --> 3:35:23.080]  many ways self-inflicted.
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:24.480]  So we can point-
[3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:30.760]  I just love how these guys' arrogance undoes them every time, I mean they just ignore our
[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:33.480]  numbers but we know they're not because they're so freaked out.
[3:35:33.480 --> 3:35:39.360]  We are wanting to make America safer and better, we brought this upon ourselves for that.
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:42.320]  That's why people are going to shoot us because we're going to make the country better, I
[3:35:42.320 --> 3:35:43.480]  mean it's just our own fault.
[3:35:43.480 --> 3:35:47.280]  And the media wants terrorism for the ratings and the ad dollars and sell people more pharmaceuticals
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:53.760]  and get people more on SSRIs and get people popping pills and control people and brainwashed
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:35:57.320]  people keep everybody home, they really, I mean if you think about it, they just want
[3:35:57.320 --> 3:36:03.000]  you inside your home, never leaving, never part of your community, isolated and alienated
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:07.440]  and then that's how they can radicalize people through their chat rooms and stuff.
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:12.880]  I mean we all know, we all know that they have chat rooms where they find these wayward
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:16.680]  people and they radicalize them and brainwash them and say, why don't you have the courage
[3:36:16.680 --> 3:36:17.680]  to do it?
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:19.720]  Well remember the Facebook documents came out a few months ago where they're targeting
[3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:26.880]  pathetic, no friend, nobody, so we care about, but trying to turn them into SJWs as weaponized
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:27.880]  zombies.
[3:36:27.880 --> 3:36:32.040]  Yeah, it's a whole mind control mission, that's the whole thing, it's a nationwide brainwashing
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:35.120]  mind control mission, that's why they want to shut us down because I was thinking about
[3:36:35.120 --> 3:36:38.800]  this actually earlier today and I was like, you know, when you really think about what
[3:36:38.800 --> 3:36:43.520]  we believe, we shouldn't have jobs because people should say that is just boring.
[3:36:43.520 --> 3:36:46.920]  We believe in prosperity, peace, equal opportunity, entrepreneurs-
[3:36:46.920 --> 3:36:48.480]  There's a war on common sense.
[3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:51.560]  Yeah, I'm thinking like, why do people hate us?
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:55.080]  People should say, you know, you guys are just boring because of course everybody wants
[3:36:55.080 --> 3:36:59.640]  the races to unite, they want equal treatment for everybody, they want entrepreneurialism,
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:04.840]  they want people to feel hopeful and optimistic, we shouldn't have jobs, but when we say things
[3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:09.240]  like we want people to feel empowered and to have energy and to feel good about life
[3:37:09.240 --> 3:37:14.480]  and to be connected and be involved in their community and to take care of one another,
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:16.720]  that gets us attacked, it's so bizarre.
[3:37:16.720 --> 3:37:20.760]  Because the big corporations want to take over and they've done the equations, everybody's
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:22.640]  bunch of zombies they can take over.
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:27.960]  Yeah, mindless consumers is what they want, mindless consumerism, brainwash people, get
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:30.440]  them into debt, make them take out student loans-
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:34.400]  Stay on welfare, stay in their house, watch their programming, get in their autonomous
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:38.280]  car so they can control where they go and they're being watched everywhere they are,
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:39.280]  it's just ridiculous.
[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:41.160]  God, who would want to live like that?
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:42.160]  Sounds horrible.
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:43.160]  Man.
[3:37:43.160 --> 3:37:46.240]  That's why you need to get out there, get it gone, go hunting, kill your own food.
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:50.680]  Because they are the ultimate OCD though, because I got an OCD about information because
[3:37:50.680 --> 3:37:58.680]  I want it all, but they literally just want to control everything we do.
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:37:59.680]  It's bizarre.
[3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:00.680]  Control.
[3:38:00.680 --> 3:38:01.680]  And I don't know why they would enjoy that.
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:06.120]  They want, I mean, I think I probably do is because of the slavery issue and everything
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:10.600]  like that and it's also easier to, so just like they're trying to groom people for pedophilia
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:15.480]  and stuff, it's easier for the pedophiles and everybody to human traffic and everything.
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:20.840]  So there's a lot of that too, is the modern day slavery that the elite use and the pedophilia
[3:38:20.840 --> 3:38:21.840]  traffic.
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:24.040]  They want globalism because it's predatory.
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:28.120]  There's a lot of folks with different tastes, but they like the predatory nature of it.
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:29.120]  Exactly.
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:32.280]  And what better way to go, just like they did in Rotherham?
[3:38:32.280 --> 3:38:37.360]  What better way to find all this, all the slavery and all these people, broken homes?
[3:38:37.360 --> 3:38:41.880]  We all know that broken homes allow them to groom, pedophiles to groom people.
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:46.100]  So you realize that is why when I say the media is a terrorist organization, the media
[3:38:46.100 --> 3:38:49.840]  supports pedophilia and they think that I'm overstating things.
[3:38:49.840 --> 3:38:53.680]  And I say, if anything, I'm actually understanding it because you're trying to destroy the family.
[3:38:53.680 --> 3:38:55.200]  You're trying to destroy virtue.
[3:38:55.200 --> 3:38:56.320]  You won't investigate things.
[3:38:56.320 --> 3:38:57.520]  You cover things up.
[3:38:57.520 --> 3:39:01.720]  When there is an arrest like with Anthony Weiner, the Washington Post, I don't know if you
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:02.720]  guys have the story.
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:03.720]  You covered it.
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:06.640]  There was an article in the Washington Post where they said, stop talking about Anthony
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:08.640]  Weiner.
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:09.640]  Washington Post.
[3:39:09.640 --> 3:39:13.680]  Why should we stop talking about a pedophile who was being groomed to be the president,
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:17.120]  who was married to Uma, who was Hillary's hot person?
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:19.240]  They're saying, don't talk about pedophiles.
[3:39:19.240 --> 3:39:22.640]  And then they wonder why we accuse them of endorsing pedophilia.
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:28.720]  In Juarez, Mexico and Mexico in general, there's a large homosexual population and those children,
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:33.000]  those boys are kicked out of their homes and they get sent to what's like halfway houses.
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:38.760]  And these halfway houses are really fronts for like a prostitution ring.
[3:39:38.760 --> 3:39:39.760]  I'm working on something.
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:43.560]  I've been going down to Mexico over the last few months, but there's an elected official,
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:47.960]  numerous ones here in the US that are flying down there and getting these boys and they're
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:48.960]  doing this stuff.
[3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:53.200]  And it's right there and the cartels are running these facilities and they're allowing these
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:59.360]  boys to come in there and they're selling them off as prostitutes to rich elite people.
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:00.360]  It's pretty disturbing.
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:02.360]  And the media doesn't want to cover this.
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:04.600]  It is happening in Haiti and it's happening all over the world.
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:05.600]  It's not just there.
[3:40:05.600 --> 3:40:09.720]  In Australia, it's happening all over the world and that's the biggest story in the
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:10.720]  world.
[3:40:10.720 --> 3:40:12.960]  But they'll cover anything we do.
[3:40:12.960 --> 3:40:17.960]  If we make one joke or maybe a mistake of word, that'll be big international news.
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:22.440]  But when it comes to actual pedophilia rings going on and elected officials like Dennis
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:26.440]  Hastert, of course, pedophile, he was in DC for 20 years.
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:27.440]  Why is nobody in the...
[3:40:27.440 --> 3:40:28.960]  For the Republicans as a procurer.
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:29.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:31.840]  But let me ask this then.
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:34.800]  Why are they so angry at info wars?
[3:40:34.800 --> 3:40:35.800]  Because...
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:36.800]  Exposing it.
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:38.720]  A lot of these people are part of that.
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:41.280]  Yeah, it's hard for you to understand because you're not an evil person.
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:42.800]  It's hard to empathize.
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:46.560]  But if you get into just a heart of darkness and you think about it, they're saying, well,
[3:40:46.560 --> 3:40:50.320]  wait a minute, you're trying to tell people to not be victims.
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:51.400]  You're taking away the children.
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:52.400]  Exactly.
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:40:53.400]  That's it.
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:56.800]  It's the empowerment and it's the spirit, the aggressiveness against them.
[3:40:56.800 --> 3:40:57.800]  They think they're evil.
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:40:58.800]  I'm ready to...
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:40:59.800]  I'm ready.
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:03.200]  You know, I'm afraid of them and I do have some thoughts and they picked that up is they
[3:41:03.200 --> 3:41:05.800]  understand that they feel the violence.
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:06.800]  Yeah.
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:12.400]  And so you're essentially taking away their child victims from them by encouraging what
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:13.400]  you're doing.
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:15.960]  Because they want to hurt innocents when they feel powerful.
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:18.800]  They don't like aggressive men planning war.
[3:41:18.800 --> 3:41:19.800]  Exactly.
[3:41:19.800 --> 3:41:20.800]  And they...
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:21.800]  So just think...
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:22.800]  They take it personally.
[3:41:22.800 --> 3:41:26.320]  They're thinking you're keeping me from doing the things that I want to do.
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:29.480]  Because, you know, they want to strangle and kill more than two or three children a week
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:31.000]  and they can barely get the numbers they want.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:34.200]  If they had a world government, then they could torture children every hour and then
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:36.600]  rape and murder little girls and little boys.
[3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:37.600]  Exactly.
[3:41:37.600 --> 3:41:38.600]  That's what it is.
[3:41:38.600 --> 3:41:39.600]  We're just getting in the way of their fun.
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:40.600]  Yeah.
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:43.240]  So they just see us as like a doorway blocking them.
[3:41:43.240 --> 3:41:44.600]  They're trying to blow the door down.
[3:41:44.600 --> 3:41:46.200]  Well, that's why they take it personally.
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  That's why they're so angry, right?
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:50.680]  Because they never want to disagree with us intellectually.
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:53.240]  They'll never want to debate our ideas intellectually.
[3:41:53.240 --> 3:41:55.480]  For them, this is very, very personal.
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:41:59.760]  You are stopping them from molesting children, from engaging in human trafficking, just like
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:05.200]  Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein, taking trips to the entire Clinton Foundation.
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:10.320]  People all busted, changing names, shipping kids in, U.N., murdering children, enslaving
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:11.960]  them in mass, everywhere.
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:13.640]  It's a cult of pedophiles.
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:18.400]  And the reason that we're so hated is because we're the ones calling out Dennis Astor, Republican
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:19.400]  Speaker of the House pedophile.
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:21.400]  We'll say they're Republican pedophiles, too.
[3:42:21.400 --> 3:42:25.960]  We just want to get all of them out of D.C., all of them out of Hollywood, and we're not
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:26.960]  playing the part that's named.
[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:28.560]  And most of those people even have children of their own.
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:30.040]  We all have kids, we understand that.
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:31.040]  Have you noticed the...
[3:42:31.040 --> 3:42:32.040]  I'm not knocking on folks that don't have kids.
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:33.040]  I'll tell people don't.
[3:42:33.040 --> 3:42:34.040]  But they were so...
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:35.040]  Like the whole E.U. doesn't have kids.
[3:42:35.040 --> 3:42:36.040]  Yeah, none of these people.
[3:42:36.040 --> 3:42:37.040]  All the...
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:38.040]  They don't have them.
[3:42:38.040 --> 3:42:39.040]  No.
[3:42:39.040 --> 3:42:40.040]  They take them from us.
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:41.040]  Yeah.
[3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:42.040]  And now they want us to die.
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:48.160]  You know, when a Republican says when they say that, no, no, no, no, no, you will die.
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.040]  But getting serious here, Megyn Kelly's showdown with Alex Jones is a ratings bus for NBC Sunday
[3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:56.000]  night, record low 3.5 million.
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.360]  Some would say, oh, Jones, you're not a big draw.
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:00.200]  Our little videos had more than that.
[3:43:00.200 --> 3:43:03.480]  It showed everyone ran from media hype.
[3:43:03.480 --> 3:43:05.400]  They don't want to listen to you.
[3:43:05.400 --> 3:43:07.960]  We already knew it was going to happen, and you kind of scooped them on their own thing.
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:11.120]  You already knew it was going to be a hit piece, and you had the gold right there when
[3:43:11.120 --> 3:43:14.840]  she came on, and you had that audio where she's like, oh, that's not a gotchy thing.
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:15.840]  It's just...
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:16.840]  It's a pro.
[3:43:16.840 --> 3:43:19.480]  She's literally turning me on right now, and really, I'm kind of into you.
[3:43:19.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  I'm obsessed.
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:21.480]  All right?
[3:43:21.480 --> 3:43:22.480]  I was like...
[3:43:22.480 --> 3:43:23.480]  That was the biggest...
[3:43:23.480 --> 3:43:26.920]  I literally laughed while I had tears come out of my eyes when I heard that.
[3:43:26.920 --> 3:43:29.080]  I was like, you lying sack of...
[3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:33.120]  Well, she got divorced, actually, because her husband was a little bit too beta, so you
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:34.120]  can actually...
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:38.200]  In the divorce records, Megyn Kelly's divorce is actually quite interesting, and she wanted
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:39.760]  somebody who was a little bit...
[3:43:39.760 --> 3:43:40.760]  We're not...
[3:43:40.760 --> 3:43:41.760]  That's going to be all over, so...
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:42.760]  Well, I just want to tell her.
[3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:43.760]  I'm not into her.
[3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:47.440]  I'm not going to go down that path, you know.
[3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:50.560]  And Megyn Kelly, you don't have enough money to ever get me to be with you.
[3:43:50.560 --> 3:43:54.920]  Plus, I don't sell myself for money, but, you know, I know you're secretly lost and everything,
[3:43:54.920 --> 3:43:55.920]  but it's all right.
[3:43:55.920 --> 3:43:58.440]  And then they'll make jokes, and they'll say, oh, it's misogynistic.
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:43:59.840]  I'm trolling the media.
[3:43:59.840 --> 3:44:00.840]  I know I'm not a Muslim.
[3:44:00.840 --> 3:44:03.960]  Cut women's genitals off, and selling them into sex slavery.
[3:44:03.960 --> 3:44:10.160]  It's called a joke, Eric, in the great state of Indiana, from where Vice President Pence
[3:44:10.160 --> 3:44:11.640]  has risen.
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:14.920]  Eric in Indiana, last call of the day.
[3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:15.920]  Eric.
[3:44:15.920 --> 3:44:19.320]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:23.600]  The way I look at the Civil War they're trying to push, I think their end game is to usher
[3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:25.120]  in the police thing.
[3:44:25.120 --> 3:44:30.800]  I think what they want to do is get us patriots so mad, like they're going to kill Trump,
[3:44:30.800 --> 3:44:36.520]  get us to flip out over it, and then they're going to use the police to kind of take control
[3:44:36.520 --> 3:44:37.520]  back.
[3:44:37.520 --> 3:44:42.440]  And I think that's their play behind it.
[3:44:42.440 --> 3:44:43.440]  That's a great point, Eric.
[3:44:43.440 --> 3:44:44.440]  Stay there.
[3:44:44.440 --> 3:44:45.440]  I want you to come back with a comment.
[3:44:45.440 --> 3:44:47.440]  But yeah, what do they kill Trump?
[3:44:47.440 --> 3:44:53.320]  I don't know, that's an interesting thing, I mean, you know, how are people going to
[3:44:53.320 --> 3:44:54.320]  react?
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:57.960]  I mean, I personally think when I start seeing the left celebrating something like that,
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:45:01.160]  if that were to happen, you know, I don't know how I would act.
[3:45:01.160 --> 3:45:06.680]  I would be angry, you know, that there's a son that doesn't have a father anymore,
[3:45:06.680 --> 3:45:10.720]  there's sons that doesn't have a father anymore, there's a wife without a husband, there's,
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:14.960]  you know, there are always wanting to boycott us because they know they're the fake left
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:20.400]  parasites, we're the real left, Thomas Jefferson, these terms mean nothing, that it's time to
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:24.520]  do what they do, not give them our money, not associate with them, not play their games.
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:28.320]  I think now, they already want Trump dead, so we already act like they already killed
[3:45:28.320 --> 3:45:29.320]  him.
[3:45:29.320 --> 3:45:32.600]  But there's just such heartless, soulless people, like they're joking about killing
[3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:33.600]  someone.
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:38.760]  It shows they have no human emotion whatsoever, no relationships in their lives, no heart,
[3:45:38.760 --> 3:45:42.920]  no care whatsoever, like, you know, when I was in the military and someone died in combat,
[3:45:42.920 --> 3:45:45.520]  you know, I wasn't thinking, oh yeah, I got the bad guy, I'm sitting there kind of thinking
[3:45:45.520 --> 3:45:49.240]  in my head, I'm like, that guy had a wife, he had kids, you know, that's going to be
[3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:53.600]  a traumatic experience for somebody, you know, that rolls down hill and for people to just
[3:45:53.600 --> 3:45:56.080]  sit there and laugh about it, and they're frothing at the moment.
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:45:59.760]  But it's because they're wimps, they never killed anybody, or ever beat anybody, that
[3:45:59.760 --> 3:46:04.240]  they've never been in reality, Joe, that's what's so sick is them all calling for war
[3:46:04.240 --> 3:46:09.120]  when as soon as it starts, it's like Antifa will walk over and hit a woman in the head
[3:46:09.120 --> 3:46:14.440]  with a bike lock, put her in a coma, and some guy breaks their jaw, and they go to the cops
[3:46:14.440 --> 3:46:17.120]  going, arrest him, arrest him, I'm only trying to kill women.
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:19.960]  And Tim and his before that, they're screaming F to police.
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:20.960]  Exactly.
[3:46:20.960 --> 3:46:22.360]  Then they go to the cops.
[3:46:22.360 --> 3:46:23.360]  Every time.
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:27.880]  Yeah, as far as what would happen, I definitely have a list, and if anything happens to me,
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:31.840]  then, you know, things will definitely, it wouldn't be a good idea is what I'm saying,
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:36.120]  you know, Navi's not going to go into specifics, but we all have, you know, dead man switches,
[3:46:36.120 --> 3:46:40.680]  and they're all, there will be certain dominoes will tip over, so I imagine that Trump has
[3:46:40.680 --> 3:46:44.880]  the same thing, and that is why we disavow all political violence, and we encourage the
[3:46:44.880 --> 3:46:48.520]  media, which they refuse to do, they still won't do it.
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:49.520]  They want to pretend.
[3:46:49.520 --> 3:46:52.200]  We're praying for peace, preparing for war.
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:53.200]  Exactly.
[3:46:53.200 --> 3:46:57.120]  And we demand that the media disavow violence until they do it, we have to believe that
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:00.720]  they are inciting it, because if I can do it, and everybody, Joe Biggs, a veteran combat
[3:47:00.720 --> 3:47:05.760]  veteran disavows political violence, why can't the mainstream media join our pledge and disavow
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:06.760]  it?
[3:47:06.760 --> 3:47:07.760]  Yeah, why won't they even talk about Antifa?
[3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:09.520]  To me, it's the most amazing thing in the world.
[3:47:09.520 --> 3:47:15.040]  These people show up with an agenda to literally commit acts of violence.
[3:47:15.040 --> 3:47:18.080]  They even talk about it on Facebook live videos before they got there.
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:21.000]  Yeah, we're going to hit these fascists, we're going to beat up these Nazis, we're going
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:23.600]  to knock them in the head, and then they go and do it, and it's like, well, I didn't
[3:47:23.600 --> 3:47:24.600]  mean to.
[3:47:24.600 --> 3:47:27.600]  I was just kind of, I was just saying that, you know, just like, but they go all day on
[3:47:27.600 --> 3:47:31.520]  about a tweet, you know, oh my God, if you tweet something mean, call somebody fat or
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:32.520]  something.
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:33.520]  Oh, that's a big story.
[3:47:33.520 --> 3:47:36.920]  I mean tweet, internet harassment, we ought to do something about it, but meanwhile, there's
[3:47:36.920 --> 3:47:40.680]  actual political violence in the street, the media, and I'll tell you why, and this is
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:44.960]  why, you know, all the media people watching, why are you not disavowing political violence?
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:48.600]  Why is it that you can't just stand up and say, okay, the violence has to stop?
[3:47:48.600 --> 3:47:53.840]  We have to disagree with people civilly because they won't because they think we're weak because
[3:47:53.840 --> 3:47:55.520]  we're saying don't do it.
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:47:58.120]  They think we're disingenuous like them.
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:03.240]  I was at the East Valencia campus in Orlando, Florida for the anti Sharia march last week
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:05.400]  or whatever it was two weeks ago.
[3:48:05.400 --> 3:48:10.200]  And the cops divided the university that had our side on one side of that and teeth on
[3:48:10.200 --> 3:48:11.200]  the other.
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:12.560]  And they said, we couldn't cross this one road.
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:15.480]  So I think like I do, I said, okay, I crosswalk this way.
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:16.640]  I want to crosswalk over that way.
[3:48:16.640 --> 3:48:19.920]  And then I came over by myself and I go, you know, I'm going to talk to these guys.
[3:48:19.920 --> 3:48:21.320]  I want to know why they're mad at me.
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:25.040]  Why, why can't we just sit down, get a beer, let's go hang out and have a dialogue and
[3:48:25.040 --> 3:48:26.920]  maybe we find out we have a lot in common.
[3:48:26.920 --> 3:48:31.000]  They spit at me, they push, they threaten to punch me, all this stuff the entire time
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:33.560]  and the cops come running over and acting like I'm the bad guy.
[3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:34.560]  I said, I'm the only one over here.
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:38.240]  Actually kind of come over here and have a conversation and find out the differences
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:39.240]  with you.
[3:48:39.240 --> 3:48:43.960]  The question, why does the new left look like they've been hit with a radiation beam?
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:44.960]  They can't talk.
[3:48:44.960 --> 3:48:45.960]  They look like they've had lobotomies.
[3:48:45.960 --> 3:48:49.400]  They have bozo hair and they're like, scumble around and like fall down.
[3:48:49.400 --> 3:48:50.400]  They'll be like, oh, excuse me.
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:51.400]  Oh, we fall down.
[3:48:51.400 --> 3:48:52.920]  I mean, who are these people?
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:53.920]  I don't know.
[3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:57.080]  They remind me of like the little, the bubble kid or whatever because they're always covered
[3:48:57.080 --> 3:48:59.960]  and all you can see is like eyes are like, they're afraid of the sun and they're, they're
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:05.440]  all frail and weak and like the whole time.
[3:49:05.440 --> 3:49:10.080]  They would be in a lot of trouble if anything happened, but yeah, if things ever hit the
[3:49:10.080 --> 3:49:12.160]  fan, they're, they're going to die out in like two months.
[3:49:12.160 --> 3:49:13.720]  It would be over for hours.
[3:49:13.720 --> 3:49:14.720]  I mean, that's what I've told people.
[3:49:14.720 --> 3:49:17.080]  I was about to say, they want some apocalyptic war.
[3:49:17.080 --> 3:49:22.440]  Like, come on, like I have like armored compounds and like 50 calibers and I know how to hunt
[3:49:22.440 --> 3:49:28.360]  my own food and skinny animals and actually encorder them and then put them in and keep
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:31.040]  them so they stay, you know, fresh and be able to eat it.
[3:49:31.040 --> 3:49:35.160]  These guys will be like, oh my God, my hot pockets are going to be done.
[3:49:35.160 --> 3:49:37.880]  And the media is responsible for all this.
[3:49:37.880 --> 3:49:42.040]  I mean, really, that's what it comes down to is the media is the one responsible for
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:45.200]  this and they won't take any kind of personal responsibility.
[3:49:45.200 --> 3:49:49.240]  The Scott Pelley is blaming gunshot victims saying the wounds are self-inflicted.
[3:49:49.240 --> 3:49:50.880]  The media won't call them out on that.
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:52.920]  That would be 24 hours.
[3:49:52.920 --> 3:49:58.040]  Just like when you imagine they're saying major exec say it's a false flag.
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:00.480]  They say it's a false flag when there's evidence of it.
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:02.840]  They're just saying it's a false flag.
[3:50:02.840 --> 3:50:04.120]  They get away with anything.
[3:50:04.120 --> 3:50:05.120]  But that's why we're here.
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:06.120]  But they don't, though, really.
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:07.120]  I mean, the numbers.
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:08.120]  So here's the big question.
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:09.120]  They don't just tell the truth.
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:10.120]  How does it end, though?
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:12.840]  When we come back to the final segment, the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock, how does
[3:50:12.840 --> 3:50:18.440]  it end when their best gladiator they put out in the field against me, the wet walrus,
[3:50:18.440 --> 3:50:22.040]  who ain't that good, is like Tom Broca?
[3:50:22.040 --> 3:50:25.920]  I mean, what on earth is going on here?
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:27.520]  Well, he's a racist.
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:34.040]  Like I told you on MSNBC, I say, magic word, drum roll, unalloyed racist.
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:36.040]  We're going to skip the break.
[3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:37.040]  We're going to skip the break.
[3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:39.440]  So let me ask you guys that question.
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:41.360]  We can sit here and joke about this.
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:42.720]  What's really happening, then?
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:46.160]  I mean, this was their last, you know, attempt.
[3:50:46.160 --> 3:50:47.160]  It's failed miserably.
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:48.160]  They're Waterloo.
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:49.160]  They're there.
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:50.160]  Now it's done.
[3:50:50.160 --> 3:50:51.840]  I mean, what do they do for me?
[3:50:51.840 --> 3:50:52.840]  I always wore a game.
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:55.680]  I'm like, what would I do if I were them?
[3:50:55.680 --> 3:50:58.400]  And they won't do what needs to be done.
[3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:00.280]  I would tell the truth to the American people.
[3:51:00.280 --> 3:51:03.200]  I would come out pro-America, pro-patriot.
[3:51:03.200 --> 3:51:05.680]  I would go against these drug companies that poison people.
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:08.880]  I would go against Wall Street, which brings a market and which murders people.
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:10.720]  I would go against the human traffickers.
[3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:15.240]  I would go against the pedophiles in Hollywood and in the media in Washington, DC.
[3:51:15.240 --> 3:51:17.440]  But they're all part of that.
[3:51:17.440 --> 3:51:18.440]  That's the whole point.
[3:51:18.440 --> 3:51:21.320]  The only way they could beat us easily, they have billions of dollars.
[3:51:21.320 --> 3:51:23.960]  All they have to do is say, we're going to support the American people.
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:25.760]  They have to go against themselves.
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:26.760]  Exactly.
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:28.560]  Look at this headline out of a variety.
[3:51:28.560 --> 3:51:33.240]  Megan Kelly fails to find the story with Superficial Alex Jones.
[3:51:33.240 --> 3:51:36.200]  Again, they're superficial.
[3:51:36.200 --> 3:51:38.520]  They couldn't show what I really said.
[3:51:38.520 --> 3:51:42.400]  They had to have all these edits and then they turn it around again and say that I'm
[3:51:42.400 --> 3:51:44.520]  the teleprompter reader, Joe, like you said.
[3:51:44.520 --> 3:51:45.520]  Yeah, it's hilarious.
[3:51:45.520 --> 3:51:48.440]  Did you point that out when she came in here in the studio?
[3:51:48.440 --> 3:51:49.920]  Did you notice there weren't any teleprompters?
[3:51:49.920 --> 3:51:50.920]  I did.
[3:51:50.920 --> 3:51:51.920]  None of that was on the show.
[3:51:51.920 --> 3:51:53.920]  I'm pretty sure you'd probably feel a little awkward if you were to sit behind the stuff
[3:51:53.920 --> 3:51:54.920]  here.
[3:51:54.920 --> 3:51:55.920]  I go, look Megan, no teleprompters.
[3:51:55.920 --> 3:51:58.440]  I did it live on air too and none of that was in there.
[3:51:58.440 --> 3:51:59.920]  That's still the number one question I get.
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:02.920]  All they have is me over like 10 hours of off and on interview and a few times I went
[3:52:02.920 --> 3:52:03.920]  like, huh, what?
[3:52:03.920 --> 3:52:04.920]  Excuse me.
[3:52:04.920 --> 3:52:10.880]  They're like, Jones could hardly speak.
[3:52:10.880 --> 3:52:11.880]  That was the whole interview.
[3:52:11.880 --> 3:52:13.880]  That's the number one question I get every time I'm out.
[3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:14.880]  That's the number one question I get every time I'm out.
[3:52:14.880 --> 3:52:19.720]  Megan, I want to kill the black people and it was just all like edited together.
[3:52:19.720 --> 3:52:20.880]  I didn't want to kill the black people.
[3:52:20.880 --> 3:52:25.480]  I love them, but it was just like, imagine me like, you know, it was a beautiful day
[3:52:25.480 --> 3:52:26.480]  today, Joe.
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:36.880]  And I'm like, gay, Joe, Nazi, it's like, it's like, I hate Nazis.
[3:52:36.880 --> 3:52:37.880]  I love humanity.
[3:52:37.880 --> 3:52:38.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:52:38.880 --> 3:52:39.880]  I love Nazis.
[3:52:39.880 --> 3:52:40.880]  Hate humanity.
[3:52:40.880 --> 3:52:41.880]  Yeah.
[3:52:41.880 --> 3:52:48.880]  Megan should have stayed in Fox News.
[3:52:48.880 --> 3:52:49.880]  She didn't realize.
[3:52:49.880 --> 3:52:50.880]  Yeah.
[3:52:50.880 --> 3:52:51.880]  She should.
[3:52:51.880 --> 3:52:52.880]  She made a big mistake.
[3:52:52.880 --> 3:52:53.880]  Fox News, though.
[3:52:53.880 --> 3:52:55.880]  Fox News isn't even Fox News anymore.
[3:52:55.880 --> 3:52:56.880]  No.
[3:52:56.880 --> 3:52:57.880]  The whole media environment.
[3:52:57.880 --> 3:52:58.880]  No.
[3:52:58.880 --> 3:53:05.080]  You know, but I had a feeling that was going to happen, you know, when we had the ability
[3:53:05.080 --> 3:53:07.880]  to kind of hold the upper hand and kind of go, all right, this is what's going on.
[3:53:07.880 --> 3:53:08.880]  This is what's wrong.
[3:53:08.880 --> 3:53:09.880]  This is what's wrong.
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:14.760]  You know, it was a lot easier for conservative media to kind of have that high road in the
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:16.560]  sense and kind of talk about stuff.
[3:53:16.560 --> 3:53:21.160]  And then when Trump won, it was kind of like, you know, these, a lot of these networks are
[3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:22.160]  like, well, what do we talk about now?
[3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:24.160]  I mean, everything's kind of going pretty good.
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:25.800]  It's what he said he was going to do is doing it right now.
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:26.800]  They don't get it.
[3:53:26.800 --> 3:53:27.800]  But they didn't know.
[3:53:27.800 --> 3:53:28.800]  The war only got 10 times worse.
[3:53:28.800 --> 3:53:29.800]  Yeah, it got worse.
[3:53:29.800 --> 3:53:30.800]  And they failed miserably.
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:31.800]  I mean, it's just.
[3:53:31.800 --> 3:53:34.880]  Alia, one of our great analysts back there, Ali always makes great points.
[3:53:34.880 --> 3:53:38.760]  We had an Intel guy calling who's always been a great source earlier and point out the big
[3:53:38.760 --> 3:53:43.280]  message today you watch with the head of Apple, the head of Google, everybody going to the
[3:53:43.280 --> 3:53:46.960]  White House is the elite realized Trump's winning, they're going to get behind free
[3:53:46.960 --> 3:53:47.960]  market.
[3:53:47.960 --> 3:53:50.320]  A lot of the leads are actually saying was I was talking to high level people earlier
[3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:51.320]  this week.
[3:53:51.320 --> 3:53:54.640]  They're like, we were always going to be patriots, but the American people weren't ready.
[3:53:54.640 --> 3:53:58.040]  Globalists are getting ready to come over to our side, Bilderberg.
[3:53:58.040 --> 3:53:59.040]  Collapsed years ago.
[3:53:59.040 --> 3:54:01.920]  No, Cernovich knows about this, some of the same sources.
[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:04.440]  So they've gotten to that point.
[3:54:04.440 --> 3:54:08.960]  He said, watch the stock market since then it's gone up 141 points.
[3:54:08.960 --> 3:54:10.400]  And again, that's about exuberance.
[3:54:10.400 --> 3:54:11.560]  That's about belief.
[3:54:11.560 --> 3:54:12.560]  That's about prosperity.
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:16.600]  We've got three and a half trillion dollars now in there.
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:22.880]  Again, a lot of stuff's closing on Main Street because of the internet sales and people moving
[3:54:22.880 --> 3:54:24.120]  out of brick and mortar.
[3:54:24.120 --> 3:54:26.400]  But other than that, the economy's coming back.
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:28.800]  What are they going to do?
[3:54:28.800 --> 3:54:31.520]  I just see, I'm seeing patriotism come back.
[3:54:31.520 --> 3:54:36.760]  I'm seeing Americanism come back, you know, when I was in Florida, hold on, left them
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:37.760]  out at this.
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:41.160]  Joe, I really admire you and really care about you.
[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:43.760]  Joe, I do not admire you.
[3:54:43.760 --> 3:54:45.880]  That's making me feel angry.
[3:54:45.880 --> 3:54:46.880]  Sorry.
[3:54:46.880 --> 3:54:47.880]  Yeah, but I was just in Florida.
[3:54:47.880 --> 3:54:51.800]  You know, I saw people trucks driving up and down the road, Trump flags, American flags,
[3:54:51.800 --> 3:54:52.800]  amped up.
[3:54:52.800 --> 3:54:56.200]  I mean, just like, you know, just ready to go out there and just, they were just happy
[3:54:56.200 --> 3:54:57.200]  again.
[3:54:57.200 --> 3:54:58.600]  I mean, we haven't seen that in so long.
[3:54:58.600 --> 3:55:01.680]  And you know, I think people are starting to come around and understand, you know what,
[3:55:01.680 --> 3:55:03.120]  it's not the end of the world.
[3:55:03.120 --> 3:55:06.280]  And it doesn't mean there's not some dark side to all the Trump stuff.
[3:55:06.280 --> 3:55:09.320]  The point is, is that nobody has a perfect side.
[3:55:09.320 --> 3:55:12.840]  We're simply trying prosperity again, which is better than North Korea.
[3:55:12.840 --> 3:55:16.200]  Sorry, what do you have to say?
[3:55:16.200 --> 3:55:19.360]  Again, man, the young people coming up, I like what I see.
[3:55:19.360 --> 3:55:21.000]  They are being demoralized still though.
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:24.960]  Something needs to come with student loan debt reform, which is something that I think
[3:55:24.960 --> 3:55:25.960]  is appalling.
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:30.680]  Oh, the president should come out and decriminalize marijuana, take it away from the left and
[3:55:30.680 --> 3:55:36.520]  have a new program to cut debts and to cut the cost of tuition through competition.
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:37.520]  Bankruptcy reform.
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:41.680]  So if Trump wants to take the high road and just really raise hell, here's what I would
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:42.680]  do.
[3:55:42.680 --> 3:55:46.520]  I'd pardon Nassange and say that you can have a refugee in America, let the media, and
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:48.920]  I would do this all in one night to just freak the media.
[3:55:48.920 --> 3:55:54.080]  I would trigger the media, I'd fire Mueller, I'd pardon Nassange by executive order.
[3:55:54.080 --> 3:55:55.080]  I would just say, you're pardoned.
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:55:56.080]  You can now come to America.
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:55:57.080]  You can go back to Ecuador.
[3:55:57.080 --> 3:55:58.800]  We'll give you a safe passage.
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:00.040]  Just freak the media out.
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:04.120]  I would say, okay, we're not going to enforce any of the marijuana laws.
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:05.760]  Give Snow the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[3:56:05.760 --> 3:56:09.640]  Yeah, give him the Congressional Freedom, honor him as Snowden.
[3:56:09.640 --> 3:56:11.680]  Bring him in for the Congressional Medal of Freedom.
[3:56:11.680 --> 3:56:16.640]  And then I would introduce, tell Congress, we want legislation to allow these young
[3:56:16.640 --> 3:56:20.400]  people to plead bankruptcy for the student loan debt, because you can plead bankruptcy
[3:56:20.400 --> 3:56:21.400]  for your child.
[3:56:21.400 --> 3:56:22.400]  Which they should.
[3:56:22.400 --> 3:56:23.400]  That is a genius plan.
[3:56:23.400 --> 3:56:26.480]  And then just do that all one night, and then me is going to go, oh my God, what do
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:27.480]  I mean?
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:28.480]  What do I mean?
[3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:29.480]  What do I mean?
[3:56:29.480 --> 3:56:30.480]  What do I mean?
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:31.480]  What do I mean?
[3:56:31.480 --> 3:56:32.480]  You would trigger the media into.
[3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:33.480]  Meltdown.
[3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:38.120]  You would be so taxed from not knowing what to do and which master to serve that they
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:39.720]  would not be able to get out of bed.
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:43.360]  Because all liberal controllers want to do is like squat and pee on success.
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:46.680]  It's like a, it's not a one.
[3:56:46.680 --> 3:56:48.160]  I'm serious.
[3:56:48.160 --> 3:56:51.680]  Like you see like Obama, he like to squat some like peas on things.
[3:56:51.680 --> 3:56:55.960]  It just reminds me of a video of this Australian EMOM who's like yelling at his congregation
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:57:01.680]  because the certain Muslims were caught using urinals and he goes, you're supposed to pee
[3:57:01.680 --> 3:57:05.400]  in the street, stop using the urinals.
[3:57:05.400 --> 3:57:08.640]  This is so funny.
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:09.640]  You're kidding, right?
[3:57:09.640 --> 3:57:10.640]  No, I'm dead serious.
[3:57:10.640 --> 3:57:11.640]  I have it.
[3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:12.640]  Oh, it's hilarious.
[3:57:12.640 --> 3:57:13.640]  Do it, Trump.
[3:57:13.640 --> 3:57:14.640]  Pardon Snowden.
[3:57:14.640 --> 3:57:15.640]  Pardon Assange.
[3:57:15.640 --> 3:57:16.640]  Fire me.
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:17.640]  No, no.
[3:57:17.640 --> 3:57:18.640]  Start peeing on the streets.
[3:57:18.640 --> 3:57:19.640]  President Trump.
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:20.640]  All at once.
[3:57:20.640 --> 3:57:24.560]  When everybody's asleep, two in the morning, sign it, have it all ready to go.
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:29.760]  And then just shock and all the media wouldn't even know what to do.
[3:57:29.760 --> 3:57:33.440]  Briefly, this is what funds the operation.
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:37.520]  We need the funding to expand free shipping store wife for the next few days, massive
[3:57:37.520 --> 3:57:41.160]  specials on all of our top selling products, even though some of them are actually selling

[3:57:52.240 --> 3:57:53.240]  pack.
[3:57:53.240 --> 3:57:56.800]  That's the sunscreen, the bug spray because I want to move it and we need your support.
[3:57:56.800 --> 3:58:02.280]  Thank you all infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:58:02.280 --> 3:58:06.320]  Now, because I got to do it because I'm in a craze mode.
[3:58:06.320 --> 3:58:09.160]  I'm going to do a few live reports off and on, but I'll be off the next two days.
[3:58:09.160 --> 3:58:10.840]  Joe Biggs and others are coming in.
[3:58:10.840 --> 3:58:12.680]  Mike Cernovich, always great having you here in town.
[3:58:12.680 --> 3:58:13.680]  My pleasure.
[3:58:13.680 --> 3:58:15.320]  You have done well Lord Vader.
[3:58:15.320 --> 3:58:19.200]  And then the great crew right behind us putting up with me and the Natalie News tonight, seven
[3:58:19.200 --> 3:58:21.160]  o'clock central.
[3:58:21.160 --> 3:58:23.680]  And it's just so exciting to be alive and be involved in all this.
[3:58:23.680 --> 3:58:27.880]  So please keep spreading the word, but I don't want to declare victory unless it's actually
[3:58:27.880 --> 3:58:28.880]  due.
[3:58:28.880 --> 3:58:32.680]  But it's not that I'm not pathetic, just Megan Kelly is even more pathetic.
[3:58:32.680 --> 3:58:34.200]  And this was a big victory.
[3:58:34.200 --> 3:58:35.200]  So.
[3:58:35.200 --> 3:58:40.560]  And congrats again to Saul for winning that big prize, seeing it as ISIS $2,500.
[3:58:40.560 --> 3:58:41.560]  Absolutely.
[3:58:41.560 --> 3:58:42.560]  Great job.
[3:58:42.560 --> 3:58:43.560]  All right.
[3:58:43.560 --> 3:58:44.560]  Coming up tonight, seven o'clock, spread the word please.
[3:58:44.560 --> 3:58:45.560]  You are the resistance.
[3:58:45.560 --> 3:58:46.560]  You're the power.
[3:58:46.560 --> 3:58:56.560]  You're the reason we're all winning.
