[01:16.240 --> 01:24.920]  for joining us on this Tuesday the 22nd day of June 2010 edition where to start
[01:24.920 --> 01:28.840]  how about diving in right here the former head of Mossad says that he
[01:28.840 --> 01:35.880]  supports a preemptive attack on Iran so the former head of the Israeli spy
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.560]  forces and more and more politicians over there including Netanyahu the leader
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.560]  of Israel says they may go ahead and attack Iran very provocative the United
[01:45.560 --> 01:50.560]  States and of course the UN are moving to pass different resolutions to begin
[01:50.560 --> 01:57.040]  boarding all Iranian ships in multiple waterways of the Middle East this is an
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.200]  act of war meanwhile Secretary of Defense Gates is running around there
[02:02.200 --> 02:06.280]  are just repeating replaying the exact same propaganda leading up in the two
[02:06.280 --> 02:11.080]  years to the attack on Iraq in 2003 that they've got super missiles they have
[02:11.080 --> 02:17.240]  nukes and they're going to attack us any minute if we don't attack Iran they're
[02:17.240 --> 02:21.040]  going to kill us and then of course when they're done nuking Iran if we don't
[02:21.040 --> 02:25.720]  attack other countries they'll kill us and the police don't raid your house
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.400]  and shoot your dog why you may use drugs even though the government ships the
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.000]  drugs in even though the government gave nuclear weapons systems to Pakistan
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.560]  and North Korea I saw another video this morning without even looking it's just
[02:39.560 --> 02:45.440]  just everywhere of some grandmother her 28 year old grandson hasn't lived with
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.360]  her in 12 years the SWAT team came she said let me put my small dog in the
[02:50.360 --> 02:53.320]  bathroom they said okay she put the dog in the bathroom it was barking and
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.360]  growling the cops opened the door and killed the dog and say it's a good
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.840]  thing they did just no common sense it's the religion of power we're going to
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.480]  come in your house 12 years after your grandson lived with you on a drug war
[03:06.480 --> 03:09.840]  and we're gonna let you put your dog in the bathroom and we're gonna go in the
[03:09.840 --> 03:17.280]  bathroom and kill it and we're gonna be ham-fisted and stupid and it's just to
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.480]  watch the police chief defending it on the news you every time it's this
[03:21.480 --> 03:25.960]  religion of the state and the religion of the officer safety they could care
[03:25.960 --> 03:31.040]  less about your safety police when you huffed all that deadly toxin on 9-11
[03:31.040 --> 03:35.000]  they told you it was fine and blocked health care for you when they tell you
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.920]  to hang your butts out there in the middle of the road writing people tickets
[03:37.920 --> 03:42.800]  all day they don't care about your safety by making drugs illegal it
[03:42.800 --> 03:47.160]  energizes drug gangs one of the most dangerous forces out there that's why
[03:47.160 --> 03:54.880]  Mexico is completely collapsed now upwards of a hundred miles into Arizona
[03:54.880 --> 04:00.200]  well past Tucson the American people are told not to enter a three-county area
[04:00.200 --> 04:08.600]  bigger than the state of Connecticut that's coming up I don't want to hear it
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.600]  it's just it's just all mind control and this country is like a rotten horse in
[04:13.600 --> 04:21.280]  the ditch swollen it's been dead for five days and it stinks to high heaven
[04:21.280 --> 04:24.200]  I mean that's all I can really say I'm gonna be breaking that down today as
[04:24.200 --> 04:30.640]  well and look at this next WikiLeaks release may involve echelon if they
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.120]  have information related to asking the system such as the words and phrases
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.440]  used on targets of the system or actual intercepts that would be pretty
[04:38.440 --> 04:43.760]  astonishing it's hard to believe they would have stuff like this but who knows
[04:43.760 --> 04:50.360]  also Apple collecting sharing iPhone users precise locations Google faces
[04:50.360 --> 04:56.000]  prosecution in France breaking laws it's the NSA what do you think the NSA is
[04:56.000 --> 05:02.240]  gonna do a lot more stay with us the question is where should the American
[05:02.240 --> 05:08.080]  people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a
[05:08.080 --> 05:11.880]  republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[05:11.880 --> 05:16.280]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they
[05:16.280 --> 05:19.680]  think they own our land they think they're on our water children our
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.200]  education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[05:25.200 --> 05:31.000]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising we have the
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.400]  facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we have common law
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.720]  knowledge is our ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.000]  don't tread on me rise the Republic tyranny is upon us but liberty and the
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.040]  sleeping giant that is the American people is rising a new tool in the info

[06:02.560 --> 06:06.920]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:06.920 --> 06:11.080]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.120 --> 06:19.000]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.280]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.280 --> 06:27.440]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:27.440 --> 06:31.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:31.720 --> 06:35.480]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:35.480 --> 06:39.640]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:39.640 --> 06:43.040]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[08:00.880 --> 08:06.520]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.520 --> 08:13.240]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:16.560 --> 08:25.720]  we've been reporting since Sunday that large areas of Arizona one county alone
[08:25.720 --> 08:31.000]  is larger than the state of Connecticut are now off limits the American people
[08:31.000 --> 08:40.720]  this is areas far north of even Tucson so in some cases over a hundred miles in
[08:40.720 --> 08:47.840]  other areas 80 miles into the United States the police are openly saying
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.600]  mayday mayday mayday sheriff's deputies have been shot sheriff's deputies have
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.040]  been killed US military have been killed US military have been wounded FBI
[08:57.040 --> 09:02.080]  agents have been killed ranchers in Arizona have been murdered their homes
[09:02.080 --> 09:07.720]  have been burned down in one case more than 14 homes were burned in one night
[09:07.720 --> 09:14.720]  last year it is all-out mass murder it is the plan of San Diego being carried
[09:14.720 --> 09:22.480]  out the La Ricanquista the Infasora the invasion and it is actually intensified
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.560]  since the announcement that Arizona is in a mayday situation and is going to
[09:27.560 --> 09:31.840]  start if they pull someone over and they don't have IDs just like they would
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.200]  throw the book at a citizen they will throw the book at the illegal aliens
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.400]  it's a mirror of the federal law but the feds will not implement it it's come
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.240]  out any even in the Associated Press that they use illegal aliens to build
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.080]  20 something and then 50 something miles of fake fence as part of a PR stunt
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.680]  under Bush and used illegal aliens to do that all the border states are on the
[09:53.680 --> 09:58.320]  verge of going bankrupt or have gone bankrupt because of the jails in LA
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.280]  one case example more than half illegal alien Mexico is dumping its criminals
[10:03.280 --> 10:08.280]  on the United States Mexico's criminals are running to the United States yes a
[10:08.280 --> 10:13.640]  lot of these people do just want to you know work here in the country but the
[10:13.640 --> 10:19.160]  bottom line is Mexico has collapsed it's been a failed state even according to
[10:19.160 --> 10:23.240]  the State Department for two years there have been travel advisories for five
[10:23.240 --> 10:29.680]  years now those travel advisories are all over South Texas all over Arizona
[10:29.680 --> 10:35.040]  Southern Arizona up into the middle of Arizona all over New Mexico all over the
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.280]  border area in California and it's getting worse and these people have no
[10:40.280 --> 10:47.600]  IDs no names they can blend into crowds the murder that's going on is
[10:47.600 --> 10:52.520]  incredible remember the railway killer who'd been in jail more than ten times
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.620]  and had killed and robbed and stabbed and shot and just rode around on trains
[10:57.620 --> 11:03.200]  enjoying himself so the American people everything we do is listened to by the
[11:03.200 --> 11:08.000]  NSA everything we do is tracked the book is thrown at us for non-crimes our
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.480]  children are spied on they're trained to spy on us our lands being taken of your
[11:12.480 --> 11:16.040]  black white Hispanic Asian doesn't matter if you're a citizen in the grid
[11:16.040 --> 11:21.080]  you were there to be bled by the vampires but the globalist vampires want
[11:21.080 --> 11:27.080]  desperately to break this country they're involved in a revolution against
[11:27.080 --> 11:32.080]  the country they've got to break it and bankrupt it to the central banks and have
[11:32.080 --> 11:36.800]  a voting block that will vote for gun control and open borders and for pure
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.040]  democracy where 51% say take the middle class's property and give it to us the
[11:42.040 --> 11:45.680]  poor people but of course it's always baited and switched and given to the
[11:45.680 --> 11:49.880]  elites once the middle class is destroyed the poor and working class and
[11:49.880 --> 11:56.720]  blue collar have no strategy or no ladder to go up into the middle class see
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.640]  we had a growing middle class until 30 years ago since then it's been shrinking
[12:00.640 --> 12:05.600]  we had a middle class the envy of the world so did Argentina a hundred years
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.360]  ago was the wealthiest country in the Western Hemisphere the saying was as
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.760]  rich as in Argentine now they are absolutely in bondage after controlled
[12:14.760 --> 12:20.120]  implosion after controlled implosion over and over and over again we are in
[12:20.120 --> 12:25.000]  the process of being completely broken and there's an amazing video that's
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.280]  posted in an article by Kurt Nemo large areas of Arizona now part of Mexico
[12:32.280 --> 12:39.120]  Narcos state and in this article he has the three videos one a local news cast
[12:39.120 --> 12:45.520]  out of Pinal County with a sheriff in Arizona another from Fox and another at
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.840]  a town hall with Senator Kyle admitting what we've already known what the
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.240]  Forge Foundation has admitted in their own papers they are holding America
[12:54.240 --> 13:00.880]  hostage they do not want to secure the border they want a border war they want
[13:00.880 --> 13:05.440]  burning buildings they want dead cops everywhere they want absolute
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.640]  implosion and ladies and gentlemen beautiful towns on the Texas border
[13:08.640 --> 13:15.040]  that were great tourist locations are boarded up and shut down okay it is now
[13:15.040 --> 13:20.040]  creeping all the way up to southern San Antonio the police have been taught to
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.160]  put their tail between their legs and literally have yellow you know what run
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.240]  down them and and they just scream mayday to the feds and the feds say we
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.920]  will do nothing the feds openly we told you this five years ago with our DEA
[13:33.920 --> 13:39.440]  sources trained Los Zetas their CIA they're down there raging a war against
[13:39.440 --> 13:46.160]  other cartels that don't launder their money through u.s. central banks this is
[13:46.160 --> 13:50.920]  a $500 billion a year industry and this is in this is meant to bring the
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.840]  United States into total collapse on the southwest border then the feds can come
[13:55.840 --> 14:00.960]  in and say oh we've got to have immigration reform we're going to fix it
[14:00.960 --> 14:04.640]  and then when you read the last four versions Obama's version and Bush's
[14:04.640 --> 14:08.160]  last three versions it's the exact same Council on Foreign Relations plan
[14:08.160 --> 14:12.840]  written in 2006 and published on their site yes it ends illegal immigration
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.560]  because it forms the North American corridor between Canada the U.S. and
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.520]  Mexico and a common border a geographic border and you notice for two years
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.880]  they're issuing hemispheric ID cards set of a passport you get a federally
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.560]  issued ID card which is accepted to fly it's now being accepted for truck
[14:32.560 --> 14:38.160]  drivers to drive and you can travel back and forth into the countries and so it
[14:38.160 --> 14:44.080]  does end the illegal immigration problem because it just legalizes and the
[14:44.080 --> 14:48.800]  senator said he was in a meeting with Obama and Obama told him point blank I
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.800]  am holding people hostage we are going to let this get out of control in fact
[14:53.800 --> 14:59.720]  we're gonna get to that clip in a moment let's play U.S. gives parkland along the
[14:59.720 --> 15:04.560]  Arizona-Mexican border to Mexico this is Fox News and and this is a law
[15:04.560 --> 15:09.760]  reconquista possession is nine-tenths of the law and they've burned out the
[15:09.760 --> 15:13.880]  ranchers they're burning everybody out and it's now moved past Tucson
[15:13.880 --> 15:19.200]  Tucson is now an island the Tucson Traderist City Council has ordered police
[15:19.200 --> 15:23.880]  not to ever even stop drunk driving illegals illegals robbing people I've
[15:23.880 --> 15:29.720]  watched hour after hour wrapped on YouTube of Tucson City Council meetings
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.280]  and the people go and beg and talk about crowds of illegals attacking them and
[15:34.280 --> 15:37.600]  then the YouTube videos have links to it and how the illegals running around
[15:37.600 --> 15:41.280]  with Mexican flags understand that they have been given a green light to go
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.480]  absolutely wild so the feds can come in and say their solution is totally
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.280]  dissolving the border and turning the U.S. into a third-world country and then
[15:50.280 --> 15:55.600]  bum rushing bringing in the Communist hordes that Hugo Chavez for the CIA is
[15:55.600 --> 15:59.680]  training well and to totally bring this country down for the bankers this is the
[15:59.680 --> 16:05.600]  plan and it's not a joke let's go ahead and play this first clip a massive
[16:05.600 --> 16:10.120]  stretch of Arizona now off limits to Americans critics say the administration
[16:10.120 --> 16:15.360]  is in effect giving a major strip of the Southwest back to Mexico US Fish and
[16:15.360 --> 16:19.200]  Wildlife have closed a portion of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge
[16:19.200 --> 16:23.600]  all along the border warning visitors to beware of heavily armed drug smugglers
[16:23.600 --> 16:28.640]  and human traffickers Paul Babu is the sheriff in Pinal County Arizona he joins
[16:28.640 --> 16:32.280]  us now by phone I'm chair of this is a family show so I'm gonna put it like
[16:32.280 --> 16:38.080]  this what the heck is going on down there it's literally out of control and
[16:38.080 --> 16:43.040]  violence has increased just in the last four months and we've been not just as
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.200]  a sheriff all of our police chiefs in Pinal County we stood with Senator
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.640]  McCain and literally demanded support for 3,000 soldiers to be deployed
[16:52.640 --> 16:57.640]  Arizona to get this under control and finally secure our border with Mexico
[16:57.640 --> 17:01.000]  all right I got to tell you when I first received an email about this with
[17:01.000 --> 17:05.680]  these signs that are up saying you know don't go past this point stay away this
[17:05.680 --> 17:09.320]  is not safe I mean we're not talking about something that's sort of a Tijuana
[17:09.320 --> 17:11.720]  situation right at the border I mean we're talking about something that's
[17:11.720 --> 17:16.640]  north of Tucson I mean 80 miles away from the border exactly we're talking
[17:16.640 --> 17:21.320]  three counties deep into the heart of Arizona where the answer from our
[17:21.320 --> 17:26.480]  government is to put up signs warning our citizens and in our sovereign nation
[17:26.480 --> 17:32.040]  that beware of foreigners who are there who are heavily armed we have but squad
[17:32.040 --> 17:37.240]  size paramilitary elements that are working deep in our country that are
[17:37.240 --> 17:42.960]  escorting drugs and human illegals and quite frankly I'm telling you as a
[17:42.960 --> 17:47.360]  sheriff that I don't control that part of the county we have my county is larger
[17:47.360 --> 17:52.560]  than the state of Connecticut and we need support from the federal government
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.800]  it's their job to secure the border and they haven't done it in fact President
[17:56.800 --> 18:01.360]  Obama suspended the construction of the fence and that's it's just simply
[18:01.360 --> 18:05.080]  outrageous would you like to see some of the president's outrage about the oil
[18:05.080 --> 18:08.440]  spill which is justified in some of the butt kicking that he's talked about
[18:08.440 --> 18:13.960]  doing applied there on the border as well well even with that it's you say
[18:13.960 --> 18:17.760]  one thing and then you're out at a fundraiser in California and you don't
[18:17.760 --> 18:21.600]  go to the funeral of the people who died in the explosion you know it's one
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.760]  thing to say something slick on television or in a in a 10-second
[18:25.760 --> 18:32.520]  bite but we need to eat we need action and it's shameful that we as the most
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.640]  powerful nation on earth in win wars and liberate country countries throughout
[18:37.640 --> 18:42.200]  our history yet we can't even secure our own border and protect our own family
[18:42.200 --> 18:47.920]  and this is why crime in Arizona literally is among and has been in the
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.440]  highest in the nation and and we need to help sheriff we are so sympathetic to
[18:52.440 --> 18:55.720]  what you're doing down there we thank you for the incredible hard work and
[18:55.720 --> 18:59.640]  our thoughts are with you thank you for your time today thank you sir really
[18:59.640 --> 19:03.480]  fox you've been so sympathetic telling us that George Bush is good and having
[19:03.480 --> 19:07.800]  Carl Roe von who supported wide open borders and funding this drug war down
[19:07.800 --> 19:13.040]  there you want to end this right now you legalized drugs folks you decriminalized
[19:13.040 --> 19:16.960]  drugs there won't be any more money for all these paramilitary groups but you're
[19:16.960 --> 19:22.040]  not gonna do that no because the banks are laundering the money and every cop
[19:22.040 --> 19:26.480]  out there knows this our government admittedly now grows the opium of
[19:26.480 --> 19:30.720]  Afghanistan they always did that's why they kicked the Russians out that's why
[19:30.720 --> 19:36.880]  we're there now bring the smack in and that Colombian flake and all the rest of
[19:36.880 --> 19:43.640]  that cocaine coming in but this is America now remember they got plenty of
[19:43.640 --> 19:47.800]  SWAT teams and plenty of gun buyback programs and plenty of money for cops to
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.360]  come into the schools and brainwash your kids this spy on you they had plenty of
[19:52.360 --> 19:57.120]  SWAT teams go kick down doors and kill old ladies Chihuahuas but they don't
[19:57.120 --> 20:02.080]  have the manhood to get down there and that border the question is where should
[20:02.080 --> 20:07.360]  the American people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or
[20:07.360 --> 20:12.240]  a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority
[20:12.240 --> 20:16.480]  rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[20:16.480 --> 20:19.520]  dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water
[20:19.520 --> 20:25.440]  children our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will
[20:25.440 --> 20:31.560]  tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising we
[20:31.560 --> 20:35.120]  have the facts we have the Constitution we have the Bill of Rights we have common

[24:20.920 --> 24:25.040]  Eastern nations are pouring across those borders I've got countless local
[24:25.040 --> 24:30.720]  newscasts showing it the local police will catch van loads of people from Syria
[24:30.720 --> 24:38.600]  Iran Iraq Afghanistan Saudi Arabia and they're ordered to release them now
[24:38.600 --> 24:41.920]  obviously most these guys are coming here illegally just like Chinese
[24:41.920 --> 24:45.720]  immigrants are because they want jobs because we know most the terrorist
[24:45.720 --> 24:48.960]  stage and so does the government when they're good and ready to blow up some
[24:48.960 --> 24:54.200]  more buildings so they can militarize things and have you the milk cow producer
[24:54.200 --> 24:59.440]  that the vampires feed off of going to be a more slavery when they're ready to
[24:59.440 --> 25:03.560]  put a bigger ball and chain on your ankles on my ankles when they're ready
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.400]  to raise taxes and tell you it's to keep al-Qaeda from coming out from under
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.640]  your bed at night and hurting you they'll vaporize a city or blow up some more
[25:12.640 --> 25:17.360]  buildings or hijack some jets by remote control and fly them into buildings and
[25:17.360 --> 25:21.640]  then there won't be any discussion on the news of why are our borders wide open
[25:21.640 --> 25:25.720]  unless you're a citizen trying to come through with your ID oh if you're a
[25:25.720 --> 25:31.560]  citizen now your car gets x-rayed you get screamed at US customs grabs all our
[25:31.560 --> 25:36.120]  cameras every time we come back in from Canada doing an interview and calls our
[25:36.120 --> 25:40.560]  office and makes us fax them the proof of purchase to make sure we're paying all
[25:40.560 --> 25:46.120]  our duties and didn't buy Sony cameras up there and they let us know we're trash
[25:46.120 --> 25:52.040]  you pay our salary scum get out there and lick those boats we're not a I'm
[25:52.040 --> 25:55.600]  seriously folks I've had Canadian customs treat me like absolute trash
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.960]  cussing at me off and on for 15 hours you know it made the newspapers in Canada
[25:59.960 --> 26:05.560]  they were gonna send me to prison they said flying in legally because I'm
[26:05.560 --> 26:10.760]  scum and I've had the border guards treat me like scum because I'm an American
[26:10.760 --> 26:16.760]  the American guards because they've been told let this trash have it run these
[26:16.760 --> 26:21.500]  people into submission break their will they're like look at how cowardly and
[26:21.500 --> 26:31.700]  weak the slaves are meanwhile mass death mass killing 22,000 deaths just on the
[26:31.700 --> 26:36.680]  border in the last two years on the Mexico and US side combined car bombs
[26:36.680 --> 26:42.160]  going off in Dallas minor footnote I mean they're blowing up cars full of
[26:42.160 --> 26:49.080]  explosives and it's a minor footnote they're killing cops everywhere and 800
[26:49.080 --> 26:52.840]  plus cities the illegal aliens are above the law they pull them over cars full of
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.200]  whiskey pull them over with drugs they just let them go they just let them go
[26:57.200 --> 27:00.120]  and if the cops do arrest them they get reprimanded by the judge the judge just
[27:00.120 --> 27:05.280]  lets them go because the globalist want the Latin American population here
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.960]  because 90 plus percent of the time they vote for gun control and big
[27:09.960 --> 27:14.680]  government sure there's 9% I guess of conservatives that that's why Cuban
[27:14.680 --> 27:18.800]  immigrants are great for this country because they're anti-communist and
[27:18.800 --> 27:23.600]  again this isn't what you think of as the mainline definition of communism the
[27:23.600 --> 27:30.560]  bankers want communism they want to tell you see see the definition is never
[27:30.560 --> 27:33.680]  what they publicly claim it is the you know the average idiot the street
[27:33.680 --> 27:38.200]  thinks communism means a free ride means some government welfare no no it means
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.000]  you're given just enough to make you dependent on the system like Obama is
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.720]  now unveiling the details of his health bill and going oh it helps you get
[27:46.720 --> 27:51.800]  insurance and it makes poor people get it and pay for part of it and it raises
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.320]  taxes and cuts Medicare and Medicaid but I'm already digressing I want to walk
[27:56.320 --> 28:00.320]  through them we'll get into the latest on the spill the latest with Iran I want
[28:00.320 --> 28:07.000]  to walk through the situation we're facing in Arizona particularly but also
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.800]  in Texas you heard one of the sheriffs and I've had the sheriffs in Texas on
[28:13.800 --> 28:17.440]  the show I'll see it in a local paper I'll have my producers get them on over
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.960]  the years where two miles three miles six miles over Mexican troops in their
[28:22.960 --> 28:26.840]  Humvees pull up on the sheriff's deputies they'll pull over a van full of
[28:26.840 --> 28:31.600]  cocaine or marijuana this happens all the time and here come Humvees out of
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.600]  the desert on the major highways and they block the police cars in because the
[28:36.600 --> 28:40.680]  the illegals via walk a talkie or cell phone the drug smugglers call the troops
[28:40.680 --> 28:44.680]  the troops roar in and they pull right up in military uniforms and they walk
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.120]  right over and they say we're gonna kill you if you don't give us those drugs
[28:49.120 --> 28:53.000]  back and the sheriffs say they don't like it but they're surrounded three to
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.560]  one by by Humvees with machine guns on them and they call the feds and the feds
[28:57.560 --> 29:04.080]  say we're not even writing a report now imagine if citizens flying Gadsden flags
[29:04.080 --> 29:08.400]  were routinely surrounding sheriff's deputies with automatic weapons and
[29:08.400 --> 29:15.000]  robbing them it would be hyperventilating on CNN MSNBC it would be
[29:15.000 --> 29:22.160]  martial law it would be we're banning all guns in America when we come back I'm
[29:22.160 --> 29:27.280]  gonna play this senator admitting in a closed-door meeting with Obama this is
[29:27.280 --> 29:33.040]  so vital that Obama said I'm holding the American people hostage we know the
[29:33.040 --> 29:37.480]  borders and bloating we're gonna let this continue to do unravel that's why
[29:37.480 --> 29:43.400]  Bush remember his big PR firm out of Dallas the Dallas morning news reported
[29:43.400 --> 29:47.600]  funded the first illegal alien rallies five years ago they are orchestrating

[33:34.360 --> 33:38.960]  of the United States that is how all the globalist in their own books their own
[33:38.960 --> 33:43.640]  handbooks their own CFR reports describe it this is what they've done to the
[33:43.640 --> 33:50.800]  third world this is state-sponsored chaos in South Texas Arizona New Mexico
[33:50.800 --> 33:56.520]  and California and it's spreading because the illegal alien gangs can kill
[33:56.520 --> 34:00.320]  whoever they want and no one identifies them and they don't put them in
[34:00.320 --> 34:05.000]  prison the government knows what they're doing and it's high treason
[34:05.000 --> 34:12.120]  senator kyle was told by Obama in a closed-door session what is already
[34:12.120 --> 34:17.160]  obvious I studied how the British brought down China China would not allow
[34:17.160 --> 34:21.240]  opium into their country because it was so addictive and it caused problems and
[34:21.240 --> 34:25.520]  so the British learned to bring into their ports over a few decades they
[34:25.520 --> 34:29.720]  corrupted the port cities they got control of local police because of the
[34:29.720 --> 34:33.760]  opium being illegal it had huge premiums criminal gangs would rob and steal to
[34:33.760 --> 34:37.320]  get money for the opium that then got fenced through the police and the
[34:37.320 --> 34:41.760]  British Intel then British Intel worked with the United States France and
[34:41.760 --> 34:45.720]  other Western governments and broke China first into four parts then eight
[34:45.720 --> 34:51.640]  parts and 11 parts go research it this is the handbooks British Intel handbooks
[34:51.640 --> 34:55.960]  were declassified in the last hundred years you can read all of this there's
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.080]  been many best-selling books written about it and the Boxer rebellion was
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.800]  against this and then it led to the Western powers being kicked out so then
[35:05.800 --> 35:10.680]  they just funded Mao Zedong on record now declassified people wondered why
[35:10.680 --> 35:19.200]  Shankar Shet got thrown out they bring the drugs in as long as you keep them
[35:19.200 --> 35:23.760]  illegal that makes the price incredibly exorbitant and then you take over
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.720]  society through the crime gangs this is state-sponsored terrorism and now
[35:28.720 --> 35:32.760]  they're going to hold us all hostage and they're going to pass the total
[35:32.760 --> 35:38.000]  amnesty and America is broken and dead and over and you will all be peons you
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.600]  will be slaves and the government will take the giant dumb down underclass of
[35:42.600 --> 35:47.480]  poor Hispanics white people black people you name it and forge them into a
[35:47.480 --> 35:51.760]  political weapon who will vote for destroying what's left for the middle
[35:51.760 --> 35:57.200]  class and voting for 60 70 80% taxes like France and then transferring all
[35:57.200 --> 36:00.560]  that money to the elite and the underclasses will be given small
[36:00.560 --> 36:05.000]  amounts of chicken feet and the CPS will continue to take their kids for
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.840]  medical experiments and the rest of it but they won't know because all they
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.680]  care about is LeBron James and the latest basketball or football or baseball
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.560]  score they are literally wide open and psychically and politically and
[36:16.560 --> 36:22.320]  spiritually blind to the new world order and I have 2020 vision just like our
[36:22.320 --> 36:25.960]  listeners do from researching this and we're sitting here watching this in
[36:25.960 --> 36:34.200]  outraged horror this is a 21st century wrecking crew homes birding rocket
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.760]  attacks murders newspapers being hangarinated in the United States it
[36:38.760 --> 36:43.440]  doesn't even make national news rocket attacks hangarinate attacks
[36:43.440 --> 36:49.760]  kidnappings every week I read about 10 15 20 57 Americans kidnapped on the US
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.720]  side drug over to Mexico murdered in mass sold Mexican troops Mexican police
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.960]  shaking college kids down for money putting them in prison getting their
[36:59.960 --> 37:02.960]  credit card numbers demanding hundreds of thousands from their families to
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.280]  release them and then the media won't tell people to not tell their college
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.080]  kids to not go down there the dummy uppies are in such denial they send
[37:11.080 --> 37:14.960]  their young 18 year old daughters down to Mexico so they can be thrown in
[37:14.960 --> 37:18.800]  prison and have all their money sucked out of them and the stupid Americans
[37:18.800 --> 37:21.840]  because the television won't tell them still go down there to be murdered and
[37:21.840 --> 37:27.120]  kidnapped and slaughtered Mexico statistically is more dangerous than the
[37:27.120 --> 37:30.680]  late 1980s from the university studies we've read if I get that professor on
[37:30.680 --> 37:33.840]  that wrote that book about the narco terror state we had on last year remember
[37:33.840 --> 37:37.600]  that about how Mexico was fully a failed statement collapsing he he had those
[37:37.600 --> 37:41.320]  statistics Mexico and the State Department admits this is more dangerous
[37:41.320 --> 37:46.760]  than Peru was in the 1980s when the shining path killed tens of thousands
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.920]  of people and was kidnapping people in mass and our media told Americans do
[37:50.920 --> 37:56.040]  not go to Peru ladies and gentlemen it you know it's like when one of the
[37:56.040 --> 37:59.520]  Rockefeller's sons was told don't go to New Guinea and and visit with these
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.080]  tribes they kill about half the westerners that go there and literally
[38:03.080 --> 38:08.000]  boil them in a pot and eat them that's what happened to him but they won't tell
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.240]  you about Mexico no no sir no sir you're not allowed to talk about a third
[38:14.240 --> 38:18.240]  world country completely collapsing and let's go back to five years ago what
[38:18.240 --> 38:21.520]  did Celica still owe the most high-level DE agent in Latin America at the time
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.680]  what did he say he said Los Zetas is in South Texas being trained by the CIA and
[38:27.680 --> 38:30.680]  they're training other Mexican drug cartels and they're about to launch a
[38:30.680 --> 38:34.760]  giant drug war and collapse Mexico into the United States for the North
[38:34.760 --> 38:38.680]  American Union and sell he had been approached by Los Zetas to join them
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.800]  and when he wouldn't join him the ATF came to his house and arrested him for
[38:43.800 --> 38:49.920]  legal shotguns and rifles and he is now in prison railroad it because he went
[38:49.920 --> 39:01.120]  public and exposed that he told you five years ago in 2005 two and a half years
[39:01.120 --> 39:04.120]  before all this started well exactly what's gonna happen we ought to pull up
[39:04.120 --> 39:10.560]  those old interviews and rearum he told you exactly what was going to happen and
[39:10.560 --> 39:17.640]  now you see it and it's a organized crisis it's high treason oh they got
[39:17.640 --> 39:21.160]  plenty of cops in Tucson to pull old ladies over and give them tickets they
[39:21.160 --> 39:26.080]  got plenty of cops because Americans are domesticated and are gilded that
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.800]  means castrated our our our our cowards on average and they will put up with any
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.040]  amount of abuse we're domesticated we're fat and happy because our great great
[39:36.040 --> 39:39.680]  great great great grandparents were the smartest and the hardest fighting and
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.800]  the most inventive I mean people came from China and Japan and France and wrote
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.840]  about the American people and how we were the toughest the smartest the best
[39:48.840 --> 39:53.960]  the meanest and now because we got fat and happy off of our ancestors we are
[39:53.960 --> 39:59.560]  the most pathetic degenerate weak people in the world and that's why we're being
[39:59.560 --> 40:03.960]  gang raped and run over and laughed at because we put up with anything there's
[40:03.960 --> 40:07.880]  nothing we won't put up with there's nothing we won't bend over for there's
[40:07.880 --> 40:11.920]  nothing and you got to get your American spirit back you're a spirit of liberty
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.040]  you got to get that fired up in your gut right now because the entire Southwest is
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.760]  in flames right now and it's only gonna get worse you understand that what is
[40:20.760 --> 40:25.800]  the SPP documents the judicial watch sued in 2007 from the Banff Canada
[40:25.800 --> 40:29.800]  meeting say with the heads of the Fortune 100 and the head of the US State

[40:33.280 --> 40:37.260]  the Fortune 100 in the meetings thousands of pages you judge judicial watch
[40:37.260 --> 40:41.160]  God we cover it in game they said we're gonna use border crises to bring in the
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.080]  North American Union we're gonna use flu to bring in the North American Union and
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.880]  we're gonna use financial collapse and carbon tax to bring in the North
[40:48.880 --> 40:57.080]  American Union that is word for word you realize the magnitude of what we're
[40:57.080 --> 41:01.640]  talking about they are breaking America up just like they broke China up are you
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.360]  going to put up with this you heard that sheriff saying we are desperate we

[42:48.920 --> 42:52.640]  the oil and the weapons and all the rest of them we're about to attack Iran our
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.320]  aircraft carriers are over there same propaganda they use when I rack but we
[42:57.320 --> 43:03.400]  can't defend America and our newspapers can't even call these people illegal
[43:03.400 --> 43:10.080]  aliens the criminal mobs of Latin America pouring in oh you murder somebody
[43:10.080 --> 43:15.160]  in Venezuela you murder somebody in Panama you murder somebody in Mexico oh
[43:15.160 --> 43:19.520]  you killed your wife oh you got caught swindling somebody hey just come to
[43:19.520 --> 43:24.820]  America change your name and there's no extradition's going on Mexico when
[43:24.820 --> 43:30.760]  extradite people up here vice-versa's are just knock yourselves out but I as a
[43:30.760 --> 43:35.960]  citizen and looked at like a t-bone steak by the police my family is the
[43:35.960 --> 43:42.280]  potatoes I'm seen as a meal as a snack is because I'm known as the right whale
[43:42.280 --> 43:45.880]  you've heard my analogy of why the right whales were down to just a few hundred
[43:45.880 --> 43:51.280]  they estimate by the 1940s there were once tens of thousands of them over the
[43:51.280 --> 43:55.360]  entire ocean blue but right wells are sweet they'll come up and bump your boat
[43:55.360 --> 44:01.280]  they come over and nuzzle divers sperm whale will attack you a killer whale
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.080]  occasionally will attack but they're all still pretty friendly unless you're
[44:04.080 --> 44:09.760]  their prey giant squid to the sperm whale seals or sharks to the killer whale
[44:09.760 --> 44:16.040]  king of the sea they blue whales amazing video have you ever seen that stuff
[44:16.040 --> 44:20.720]  online of a pack of killer whales killing a blue whale and its calf
[44:20.720 --> 44:26.600]  drowning them pushing them under drowned my mother says stop saying
[44:26.600 --> 44:33.280]  grounded I don't say drowsy drowned drowning the point is is that right
[44:33.280 --> 44:39.160]  whales aren't like that all right whales are sweet and friendly and nice and they
[44:39.160 --> 44:43.000]  swim up to the whale boats to be killed and that's us we're just the right whale
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.720]  we're known the world over as the ultimate dunces and our yuppies laugh and
[44:49.720 --> 44:53.600]  giggle at threats and laugh and giggle at corruption I've seen the spirit it's
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.760]  a spirit of wanton destruction a spirit of wanting to go into bondage and just
[44:58.760 --> 45:02.040]  like the prophets of old told Israel when Israel became corrupt and decanate
[45:02.040 --> 45:05.080]  over and over again you're gonna go into bondage you're gonna go into bondage
[45:05.080 --> 45:08.600]  you're decanate you know you're worldly you're gonna go into bondage and they
[45:08.600 --> 45:13.360]  went into bondage it's the same thing ever seen a Pinocchio it's great to
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.000]  show your children I think it's the one Disney film that really does have a good
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.240]  message Pinocchio how does he become a real boy when he finally has courage and
[45:23.240 --> 45:27.080]  puts him himself on the line for others but first he has to go through
[45:27.080 --> 45:34.840]  tribulations Pinocchio it's taken to Pleasure Island he gets picked up by
[45:34.840 --> 45:38.240]  young street hooligans when he's skipping school and goes to Pleasure Island
[45:38.240 --> 45:43.160]  and drinks and smokes and parties and brags and gets to engage in vandalism and
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.560]  then that spiritually weakens him so he can be turned into a jackass to be a
[45:47.560 --> 45:53.880]  slave pulling coal wagons of course before that he gets enslaved another
[45:53.880 --> 45:59.320]  time following the hooligans he gets he goes to into the gypsy camp and gets
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.920]  picked up by Stromboli and uses a slave a carnival act Stromboli acted like his
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.360]  friend though see and how many times when you were young did you get con and
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.040]  manipulated by bad people and now you're 30 40 50 years old you can look back
[46:13.040 --> 46:19.360]  and say man I wish I knew them what I know now I wish I had the wisdom and as
[46:19.360 --> 46:22.440]  an adult you try to give your children that wisdom but their program not to
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.000]  listen they've got to experience it there's different ways to learn you can
[46:26.000 --> 46:34.880]  learn by experience but the best way to learn is is is by from others mistakes
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.520]  the best way to learn is is being able to see what others have gone through and
[46:39.520 --> 46:46.920]  and we know those that know history can control the future those that don't know
[46:46.920 --> 46:50.680]  history and the past are doomed to repeat it all right let's go ahead and
[46:50.680 --> 46:57.240]  play this clip as America goes into bondage as the borders are artificially
[46:57.240 --> 47:02.560]  imploded as stage crisis all County Sheriff asking President Obama to send
[47:02.560 --> 47:07.000]  troops Sheriff Paul Babu says Mexican drug cartels now control parts of
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.200]  Arizona all the way up to Metro Phoenix ABC 15th Mariella Lucinda has his
[47:12.200 --> 47:21.640]  plea a 911 distress call from two men shot and what investigators say is
[47:21.640 --> 47:25.880]  part of an ongoing battle between Mexican drug cartels and what is now known
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.880]  as the smuggling corridor drug cartels control this area and this is
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.560]  unacceptable and the local law enforcement cannot handle and stop this
[47:35.560 --> 47:41.760]  on our own Penel County Sheriff Paul Babu says drug violence is far past the
[47:41.760 --> 47:45.760]  border spilling into the communities hiking areas now have warning signs
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.640]  posted where military armed drug cartels are frequently photographed making drug
[47:50.640 --> 47:55.640]  deliveries to vehicles on highway eight we are outdone we are outmanned and we
[47:55.640 --> 47:59.840]  don't have the resources here locally for us to fight this five weeks ago
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.800]  Penel County deputy was ambushed and shot as he tracked six drug smuggling
[48:03.800 --> 48:08.120]  suspects several times the caller told operators to look for him where the
[48:08.120 --> 48:11.920]  sheriff had been shot some of the information he gave had not been
[48:11.920 --> 48:17.800]  released Sheriff Babu says the issue is too much for local law enforcement what
[48:17.800 --> 48:23.360]  is needed truly is we're looking at 3,000 soldiers alone for Arizona in
[48:23.360 --> 48:29.280]  Penel County Mariella Lucinda's ABC 15 news so you want to live as third world
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.760]  slaves you are now let's go to the key to all of this senator Kyle town hall
[48:34.760 --> 48:39.640]  meeting just a few days ago saying he was in a closed door meeting with Obama
[48:39.640 --> 48:44.720]  and Obama said I'm not gonna fix the border I want to use that as a crisis
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.240]  and this is telling somebody from another political party can you imagine
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.160]  what he really says we're gonna use this crisis to force everybody to accept the
[48:53.160 --> 49:02.880]  amnesty plan here it is now why I'll tell you why I met with the president in
[49:02.880 --> 49:08.520]  the old office just the two of us I kicked the rest of people out I asked
[49:08.520 --> 49:11.280]  him if they would leave sorry
[49:11.280 --> 49:23.080]  we had a discussion here's what the president said the problem is he said
[49:23.080 --> 49:28.800]  if we secure the border then you all won't have any reason to support
[49:28.800 --> 49:36.080]  comprehensive immigration reforms in other words they don't want to secure the
[49:36.080 --> 49:41.400]  border unless until it is combined with comprehensive immigration
[49:41.400 --> 49:49.440]  you and I this president have an obligation to secure the border that's
[49:49.440 --> 49:55.480]  an obligation it also has potentially positive benefits you don't have to
[49:55.480 --> 49:58.920]  have comprehensive reform to secure the work but you have to secure the border
[49:58.920 --> 50:03.200]  to get comprehensive reform I think you'd be surprised maybe you don't think
[50:03.200 --> 50:07.200]  that there would be any more incentive for comprehensive reform but I'm not
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.680]  so sure that that's true okay you know the issue here is that that's the
[50:12.680 --> 50:17.400]  North American SPP CFR plan that they wrote in 2005 and that you see them
[50:17.400 --> 50:21.560]  secretly discussing in the SPP North American Union meetings they said we're
[50:21.560 --> 50:25.520]  gonna have a hemispheric ID now it's been introduced and everyone from Canada
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.960]  US and Mexico will travel however they want inside the North American corridor
[50:28.960 --> 50:33.480]  the highways will be internationally seated 83 of them and will fund the
[50:33.480 --> 50:36.640]  new North American government the major highways will have tolls on it paid to
[50:36.640 --> 50:43.560]  the new government and illegals will just be legalized and then they claim
[50:43.560 --> 50:46.560]  they might secure some of the borders from drug smuggling which they have no
[50:46.560 --> 50:51.920]  intention of doing so there you have it folks high treason no other way to slice
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.920]  it they are holding America hostage you heard a US senator Obama is holding us
[50:56.920 --> 51:04.200]  hostage so was Bush they helped to create a new world order we are part of a new

[51:13.740 --> 51:17.800]  new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities
[51:17.800 --> 51:22.120]  it means all the world under their control the United Nations would take
[51:22.120 --> 51:27.240]  over America the trilateral Commission would control the world invisible Empire

[54:00.720 --> 54:10.720]  now we've covered what's happening in Arizona it's the hardest hit
[54:10.720 --> 54:18.000]  Mexico of course is in a lot worse shape than Arizona Texas is in bad shape
[54:18.000 --> 54:26.080]  then New Mexico and then of course California it is a failed giant third
[54:26.080 --> 54:30.440]  world state whose population has doubled in the last 30 years and it's set to
[54:30.440 --> 54:38.920]  double again the next 25 most analysts agree that Mexico is probably going to
[54:38.920 --> 54:44.120]  completely collapse into total road warrior in the next 12 months it already
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.240]  has in most areas when I was playing those video clips off the news it just
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.760]  showed dead bodies everywhere burning buildings armored vehicles troops
[54:50.760 --> 54:56.040]  running dead cops people kidnapped I mean to just hear the audio on the radio
[54:56.040 --> 55:00.120]  is nothing go to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and actually watch
[55:00.120 --> 55:05.400]  the videos now all of that is one thing but another thing is the federal
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.640]  government is now announced they're going to sue Arizona and other cities
[55:09.640 --> 55:15.280]  that the fed sued farmer farmers branch last year and one farmers branch said
[55:15.280 --> 55:20.600]  that they were gonna ask illegals for ID which citizens have to show when you
[55:20.600 --> 55:25.440]  get a apartment but the illegals don't again they're exempt because they're
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.560]  lawless and the system wants them here it's kind of like the bankers you know
[55:29.560 --> 55:32.240]  Congress says where's the two trillion where's this 500 billion where's this
[55:32.240 --> 55:36.320]  800 billion we're not gonna tell you mr. Bernanke you're not gonna tell me no
[55:36.320 --> 55:42.160]  I'm not gonna tell you a Geithner chairman Geithner secretary Geithner where is
[55:42.160 --> 55:46.840]  the money I'm not gonna tell you no I'm not gonna tell you because you represent
[55:46.840 --> 55:52.720]  our slaves shut up congressman I mean this government this government thinks
[55:52.720 --> 55:56.800]  you're so dumb they come out in the Washington Post admit they put out fake
[55:56.800 --> 56:01.480]  bin Laden videos folks it's all fake okay or they're real Muslims that want to
[56:01.480 --> 56:07.040]  kill you sure most of them are funded by the CIA through their imams above them
[56:07.040 --> 56:10.840]  and the mindless automatons that are out carrying out the attacks really think
[56:10.840 --> 56:16.280]  they're doing it for Allah they're being handled you better realize how
[56:16.280 --> 56:19.480]  duplicitous things aren't realized that the Constitution the Bill of Rights is
[56:19.480 --> 56:25.480]  the only hedge of protection this republic has my friends it is the only
[56:25.480 --> 56:30.400]  hedge of protection that this society has and that when you lose your due
[56:30.400 --> 56:34.360]  process in your bill of rights you were wide open to every criminal element and
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.680]  so there's a great headline here amid crisis Obama declares war on Arizona
[56:38.680 --> 56:44.840]  out of the examiner the Obama administration has a lot of fights on
[56:44.840 --> 56:48.640]  its hands putting aside real wars in Afghanistan and Iraq there's the battle
[56:48.640 --> 56:52.320]  against leaking oil in the Gulf the struggle against 9.7% unemployment more
[56:52.320 --> 56:57.720]  like 25 23 is the what the big industry is putting out across the country and
[56:57.720 --> 57:01.360]  clashes over the president's agenda on Capitol Hill despite all that the
[57:01.360 --> 57:04.480]  White House has found time to issue a new declaration of war this time against
[57:04.480 --> 57:09.400]  an unlikely enemy the state of Arizona we're gonna cover that more coming up in
[57:09.400 --> 57:16.160]  the next hour and Nebraska City votes to restrict illegal immigration AP
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.280]  reports the feds declare they're gonna run in and block that one of Obama's
[57:20.280 --> 57:24.960]  azars over labor is he's got TV ads taxpayer paid for running telling
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.040]  illegal aliens to tattle on their employers if they're not being paid
[57:28.040 --> 57:33.880]  full-wage that'll actually backfire then people that are exploiting the
[57:33.880 --> 57:43.240]  illegal alien slave class of labor they may now actually get in trouble oh man
[57:43.240 --> 57:48.840]  that's good ladies and gentlemen we are in free fall Mexico's only hope and I
[57:48.840 --> 57:51.720]  pray for the people of Mexico they're good people deep down they just never
[57:51.720 --> 57:54.880]  had freedom they've always been under dominance of evil whether it was the
[57:54.880 --> 58:05.200]  Aztecs or the Mayan culture that it grew from or the conquistadors all of it it
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.720]  doesn't matter they've never had a chance at freedom they're good people but we
[58:09.720 --> 58:13.680]  need to help patriots in Mexico we need to have Washington we need to take
[58:13.680 --> 58:17.960]  Washington back because Washington is manipulating Mexico and teaming up with
[58:17.960 --> 58:22.720]  the tyranny down there to oppress their people we need though to not allow the
[58:22.720 --> 58:26.760]  usb uses a political steam valve and to let the Mexican people be brainwashing
[58:26.760 --> 58:31.120]  tools against the United States by the bankers all right next hour coming up

[58:54.080 --> 58:58.280]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[58:58.280 --> 59:02.600]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[59:02.600 --> 59:06.560]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:06.560 --> 59:10.960]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.200]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.200 --> 59:18.960]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:18.960 --> 59:23.080]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.080 --> 59:27.040]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.040 --> 59:30.880]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.040]  whatever they want as the senator Kyle said in a meeting with Obama Obama said
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:45.240]  we're holding the American people hostage we are not gonna let there be
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.600]  any control the border until they accept amnesty that's what the immigration
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.000]  reform is every time they bring it out it's just what we legalize all the
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.360]  illegals so they won't have to walk across they're still gonna be bringing
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.400]  the cocaine across folks and what you do is you decriminalize that if somebody's
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.160]  dumb enough to use it dumb enough to have a heart attack I mean people can get
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.840]  high off stuff under the kitchen sink do we ban all of that no when cocaine and
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.440]  heroin were legal a lot less Americans were using it when it was in every drug
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.440]  store in the country till the 1930s but they made it illegal then it had money
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.520]  involved then it became trendy and now people are breaking in your house to get
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.120]  money for the illegal drugs your daughter is out horn herself out to get
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.600]  the drugs whereas she could just get it at the drug store and then get into
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.440]  treatment and she never would have used it before because it wouldn't have been
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:40.560]  promoted as cool and avant-garde and trendy the globalists know what they're
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.120]  doing and this is designed to implode Mexico and the US next so what are we

[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.280]  have reported the hydrologists reported that it will start driving a lot of that
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:53.600]  oil that's just massing out on the gulf into texas and mexico not just louisian
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:57.800]  and mississippi and florida and i hate to be selfish but it almost at a
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.000]  subconscious level i'm like oh i love the texas coast you know grew up going
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.080]  down there and i i hate seeing the florida beaches ruin that i've been to a

[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:25.120]  hitting anybody but tropical storm may pose threat to bp spill clean up carl

[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.680]  worst oil spill in u.s history thunderstorms in the caribbean may
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.080]  strengthen into a tropical storm this week before heading into the gulf
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:08.720]  between mexico and cuba said jim rolier a senior energy meteorologist in
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:13.520]  pennsylvania the first named tropical storm 2010 season appears more likely
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:19.040]  to form over the northeastern caribbean late this week and will go on to
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.920]  represent a formidable threat in the gulf along with heightening concerns about
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.400]  the oil slick he said forecasters are predicting this year's atlantic hurricane
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.840]  season which runs from june 1st to june 30th may be among the most active on
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.480]  record yeah look at what's happening right now in the u.s how much rain and
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:43.320]  the deadly storms were having that killed all those people in arkansas killed a
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.680]  bunch of people in south texas they had over a foot and a half of rain in one
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:52.360]  day most of it fell in one hour in new bronville two weeks ago i was gonna take
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.040]  my kids down to new to slitterbond that weekend and turn on the news to check it
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.480]  out and it was just completely flooded nobody died at slitterbond but they
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:08.800]  died at a campground down the down the comal river it was just horrible one
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.000]  foot of rain in an hour my friends so yeah it looks to be a doozy this year
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.200]  right on time for this spill also bp oil spill leak found in rig weeks before
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.680]  blast and of course that's the one in telegraph first it was two weeks then it
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.240]  was a month now it's two months and i don't understand all the technicalities
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.800]  of this okay i don't drill oil wells but i've read the coast guard hearings
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:39.520]  from weeks ago and if you can get in as petroleum geologist we'd like you to
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:45.640]  explain this to us or as an engineer or as a petroleum engineer but all i know
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.440]  is is that it said that the rig operators at anadarko and of course
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.520]  helleburton and i don't love helleburton i've been critical of helleburton and
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.920]  its corruption and it's no bids but the facts are helleburton was on record
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.120]  complaining to bp and they were contractors and that's in the hearings
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:12.000]  that the helleburton and the anadarko people and you notice that's why it's
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  in the news today people are saying why won't bp 60 plus days into this sue
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.280]  anadarko or other companies that were involved because they told them what to
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.200]  do and that's come out in the hearings now i've described it on air as they
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.480]  were dumping seawater in which is unheard of now seawater being dumped in is
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:35.760]  going on during the drilling what happened was though that it was done
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:42.280]  instead of putting in the cement and the mud is the way it's been described so
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.680]  that's what's unprecedented what made the engineer so mad and why they're on
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.480]  record in those hearings saying they said it was going to blow up and cause a
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.880]  problem and this continued even after they were having the problems but you can
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.160]  go read the coast guard reports for yourself about this a bottom line is
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.080]  they knew what they were doing when bp gave those orders they were told by the
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.840]  rig operators by both the contractor group heads that this is going to blow up
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.360]  this is unheard of this is crazy what you're doing the way they did this well
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.040]  bp oil spill leak found in rig weeks before blast the deep water horizon
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.880]  rig which exploded causing the Gulf of Mexico's oil spill had suffered a leak
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:21.240]  in the weeks leading up to the blasts an employee has claimed and it goes on from
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:27.400]  there okay that's enough of that let's go ahead and go to your phone calls and
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.480]  then i'm going to get into a bunch of other news on the economy on the iran

[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.880]  i think a lot back and that's the girl had a uh... interviewed a sheriff down
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.720]  there
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.120]  uh... near the park uh... and real grantee city
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.920]  which is just down the road
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.000]  and that
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.400]  what i understand is a real real bad hotbed down there and i haven't interviewed
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.520]  those sheriffs in about three years we had a gaggle of them on
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.960]  and they all said the same thing uh...
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.720]  that that that that the the illegal
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.760]  uh... drug cartels come to their deputies and say i'm gonna kill you and
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.320]  your wife and children if you don't get on the payroll
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.280]  and so most of them go on the payroll
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.320]  and some valiant sheriffs have spoken out against it and then some of them get
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.760]  shot or threatened
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.200]  uh... and they just roll over and take the drug money the feds are involved in
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.480]  it they leave me alone
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.000]  and uh... yeah
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.760]  if they ever do interdict cocaine or other drugs
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.360]  the mexican troops were coming in a mile than two than three than four than
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.400]  five and six
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.480]  they're now upwards of a hundred miles into arizona
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.000]  and fifty miles into texas
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.800]  total lawlessness so so yes sir we did
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.640]  have those sheriffs on and we should get them back on
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.240]  well that's an alice god bless free work sir and we're spreading the word to
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.080]  brother

[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.600]  yeah member last year uh... folks from uh... the uh... national guard in texas
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.080]  sent us a document they didn't say who they were
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.160]  smart leakers
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.240]  uh... and i call the phone numbers and uh... confirmed it was real
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.760]  they simultaneously leaked it to some other publications

[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:14.840]  how ron paul myself are sir are surveilled by army intelligence
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.960]  and it said when you go to the end the fed rallies namely in dallas when they
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.920]  were there covering and we will we have that the obama deception by the way
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.120]  uh... they said do not let the in the feathers know that your army intel or

[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.480]  so you got a bunch of women children men
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.760]  people of all races out there peacefully bullhorning the federal reserve
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.440]  and the armies there and they're and they tell these army men
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.880]  and you know they tell these intelligence officers that don't let them know
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.120]  your army or we may turn and kill them
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.800]  you give me a break
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.440]  give me a break
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.800]  i mean come on
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.160]  come on we're not the lawless criminal stealing trillions of dollars out of the
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:53.880]  treasury
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.480]  we're not the ones let the borders be wide open we're not the ones that use the
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.500]  federal government as their private cash machine
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.800]  so see they teach the cops that the american people are a bunch of terrorist
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.880]  and that anybody stands up for liberty and freedom and what this country is
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:08.920]  built on
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.280]  you understand ladies and gentlemen what you hear on this radio show by every

[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:51.840]  four months and we've been not just as a sheriff all of our police chiefs in
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.360]  Pinal County we stood with Senator McCain and literally demanded support

[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.520]  heart of Arizona where the answer from our government is to put up signs

[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:49.920]  welcome thank you Alex hello hi yeah looks like we might have a short way to
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:56.480]  go and where we're going to doesn't look good at all Alex no it's already out of
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.140]  chaos the globalist admit they're holding America hostage they're
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:04.520]  engineering all the crises they blew that oil well in the Gulf Obama brags to
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:08.640]  senators he's holding his hostage with the rampant crime these are absolute he
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.680]  is guilty of the murders on the border and every trader that is keeping that
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:19.160]  border open is guilty of premeditated accessory to murder Obama is a public
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:27.560]  criminal I couldn't agree with you more Alex officer Jack McClam on his show
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:36.320]  soon after the explosion in the Gulf he said unequivocally from the sources that
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.520]  he gets his information from in government in the intelligence community
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:47.560]  he said that the BLM the Bureau of Land Management who has no business out on
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:52.600]  the ocean in the first place that in all probability it was a it was a group
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:57.920]  posing as the BLM well that may be why Obama said he dispatch SWAT teams to
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.240]  cover up the investigation that that the Coast Guard was doing and the word is
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.160]  special federal fed showed up with national security badges ordering the
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.960]  Coast Guard to not investigate but but you know what I didn't I'm a clam has
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.040]  impeccable research if he says something that he has a source he doesn't make it
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.240]  up 25 years on the front lines call Jack McClam right now see me get him on the
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.960]  last 30 minutes with Watt if not tomorrow red alert by the way we've got
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.040]  Jesse Ventura Friday and Thursday Lord Monkton and a bunch of other heavy
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.560]  headers go back and finish up exactly what Jack McClam said I was unaware of
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.760]  this mark yes Alex Jack McClam said that he's learned he learned at that time
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.720]  soon after the the explosion that that particular oil rig it was not a any
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:46.200]  other oil rig but that one just like Obama gave it an actual award of some
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.560]  type to that particular one a year and he gave it to them and BP are the king
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.240]  pens of the carbon tax mm-hmm and that the BLM came out on the water in in
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.320]  uniform of course but not being BLM at all great probability but posing as a
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.560]  BLM where they have no business and they came all the way out there and did a
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.960]  surprise inspection two hours before the explainer that's admitted that there
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:15.440]  was a surprise inspection that was quoted unauthorized unlawful and the
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:22.200]  it wasn't awful the word the media and the feds have used was unpermitted but
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.640]  it was more than unpermitted they said that as well it was a it violated
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.880]  regulations it was and but they won't ever say what the change is and obama
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.680]  mr. Barry Sataro's been covering that up yes and Jack McClam said that in
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:42.720]  connection with this visit Alex that he was told that the BLM whatever they
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:48.760]  were doing this inspection actually had left an explosive device on the rig
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.720]  now if you think out of it in terms of engineering you could have an explosion
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.480]  to actually be the second the secondary to the primary such as a nuclear
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.680]  explosion type of well I mean it was the explosion to ignite the gas and the
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.360]  oil that it was was starting to come in and then that makes the rig break and
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.200]  fall down on itself and then break at the wellhead yes sir and I saw that this
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:19.400]  is very important information because it just it adds in the whole premeditation
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:24.640]  aspect of this which everything that they do is premeditated so that we can
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:31.080]  almost if not assume that everything that is learned from higher sources that
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:36.640]  are fortunate enough to we're fortunate enough to have reported to us that it's
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:39.840]  really true and we really need to look into it deeply whenever we hear well
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.840]  that's a great idea we're gonna call Jack right now get him lined up today or

[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:20.440]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.760]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.520]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:15.280]  of kissing tail but I've been seen with Farrah I've never been with anything but
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.480]  I want to encourage you the listeners to really think about something to make a
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:28.560]  decision are you doing everything you can to wake up as many men women and
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.720]  children in your area as is possible are you reaching out to opinion makers
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:44.520]  right now so many high-powered politicians media personalities judges
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:52.080]  sports icons I have been contacted I'd say nine times out of ten when famous
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:34:01.560]  people contact me they don't want to come on air they just want to talk to me
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:07.920]  and invite me out to their house and DC or LA or Santa Barbara or wherever or
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:14.560]  Florida I don't have time for that I don't have time to or the money to jet
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:18.000]  set around and hang around with famous people I haven't gone that that route
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.360]  the point is that's a gauge of how many people we're reaching
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:31.880]  drudge is rated 400 and something on Alexa comm info wars is now rated 700 and
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:36.400]  change I forget the exact rating and if you look at our growth trend within a
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:44.560]  year will be neck and neck with drudge we haven't really been good at putting on
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.680]  errors or being aloof or explaining to people just how big we are just how
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.920]  effective we are I haven't really admitted to myself the reach we've got
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.280]  and I'm not bragging about myself individually it's a dangerous position
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.120]  to be in the government the mainstream media and the NSA have known how big
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:10.840]  we are before I knew they've got all the data points and now they've tried to
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:15.160]  ignore me all this time now they've got to attack which is a desperate gamble so
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.280]  I'm in a real dangerous zone here I need your prayers and I'm trying to be
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.400]  focused and realize the position I'm in and do the best job I can doesn't mean
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.800]  I'm perfect doesn't mean I don't make mistakes but at least I'm pure of heart
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.480]  I'm trying to be good I'm trying to tell you the truth I'm trying to get it
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:37.280]  right I'm I'm trying to be honorable I'm trying to not be worldly I'm trying to
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:45.000]  work as hard as I can I feel guilty when I enjoy food or go for a swim or go see
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.680]  a movie I wish I don't even really do all I do is think about this folks that's
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:55.400]  it's I'm totally committed to it I'm I'm driven almost nuts by it I want to not
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.040]  think about it and I can't stop I dream about the new world order I dream about
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:03.200]  legislation I dream about executive orders I dream about the enemy's next
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:15.640]  operations I eat sleep you know what all of this and I know a lot of you 10
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.640]  years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago gave people a book gave people a video gave
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.120]  people a newsletter but now you think you've done your work now now is the
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.840]  time I can't tell you how many people I talked to who say I thought you were a
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:33.920]  cook I thought you were a nut five years ago a year ago 10 years ago it
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.560]  varies now it's all true and worse than you say and they start you know just
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:41.720]  dumping all this info on me did you know about this you know about that no I
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.000]  didn't know about that I knew about that people are really seeing it folks but
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.640]  there's still I'd say we've got about 35% of the public are conservatively that
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:56.960]  really know something's wrong 10% really understands the ballgame 30% or so
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:00.400]  know something's wrong another 30 40% are starting to wake up we got to wake
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.000]  them up now before they start World War 3 as a political diversion to keep the
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.880]  globalists in power before they stage another false flight there's no doubt
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.680]  this oil spills a false flag you got a US senator that met with Obama and he
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:16.680]  admitted they're keeping the border open and keeping the crime high to force
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:21.120]  through immigration reform I mean it this is what they do this is their
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.040]  modus operandi I know these people it's so frustrating to watch these crooks get
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:34.320]  away with this America is at the crossroads right now and people are ready

[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:25.360]  spiritual and I never set out to try to bring people to the truth concerning
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.120]  Christ I have a secular show I want to bring them to the truth of the
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:34.840]  geopolitical nature but that is the end bounty and I'm very pleased by it and I
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.960]  realize that but I didn't consciously set out to be some preacher people find
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:41.800]  out about the new world order and find out they really are Satanist they start
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.760]  realizing then this is real that's why they have movies like the Sherlock Holmes
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:51.720]  that I just got done watching it's very good but the message is yes Satanist
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.840]  run things but they're just cooks and a master atheist controls them well
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.160]  whatever they believe in Satan and they're manifesting it ladies and

[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:07.640]  holding welcome well good to be able to get on
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:15.560]  um hey Alex wasn't part of the original purpose of militias for assisting
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.240]  law enforcement such as the sheriff yes isn't there isn't there a militia in
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:28.200]  Arizona to back up the sheriff's no the media a hundred years ago started
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:31.080]  calling on posse's they were really called militias I've gone back to the
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.200]  old newspaper articles in the 1840s 5060 70s and you know 80s 90s and that's how
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:39.640]  the sheriff under the militia power could say you you and you come with me
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:43.520]  and normally he'd find guys that were former military or that they trusted and
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.240]  that they would you know deputize and it was just really civil defense but see
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.240]  the government the corporate structure doesn't want citizens to know they're
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:55.520]  part of the system or that the people are the government you know the message
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.800]  that we could be armed and so even these sheriffs begging for federal help are
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.400]  kind of saying you I noticed this one sheriff isn't demonizing these militias
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.880]  running around with them 16s in the junk in the scrub brush they're just
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:10.960]  saying hey this is dangerous thanks for the help but this is only going to
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.480]  escalate it and Mexico's full of desperate people that the drug cartels
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.600]  and the government can hire and so they're gonna fight and they're not
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:26.960]  wimps and so that maybe if it coming to a head is what has to happen for people
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:31.880]  to for people to finally face what's going on but no I mean those sheriffs I
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:36.440]  guarantee if they showed up and went on the local radio and said all right we're
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.400]  gonna have training next week and I need you know people to come in we'll do
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.080]  background checks make sure they're not felons make sure they're upstanding in
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:50.160]  the community and that they've got some type of firearm training and particularly
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:54.000]  military veterans and if you called out Americans you'd have in the smallest
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.520]  towns half the men show up and and go down there and let the Mexican
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.720]  government the troops open fire this time our people won't run they will
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.800]  absolutely beat them over the border and if Mexico wants to attack we'll go
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.920]  back down to Mexico City like we've done before okay I mean if Mexico wants a
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:15.040]  war it's time to have it this is a real war wars are with countries that border
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.360]  you that are attacking you they're not with people 8,000 miles away let me
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.520]  tell you some Mexico starts a war with us I'm gonna go enlist right now I want
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.600]  to go I'll go down there right now that's what war is all about defending the
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.400]  Republic it's not about killing a bunch of poor Arabs I'm sorry go ahead so
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:43.080]  anyway if I work stuff I'd be trying to assemble a posse right now yeah I mean
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:46.280]  it's okay for SWAT teams to kill dogs and shoot kids in the back at the wrong
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.280]  house they always defend themselves but God forbid a few eggs get broken with a
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:55.600]  paramilitary force attacking our country 80 to 100 miles in God forbid we send the
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:02.000]  military down there to like these people up that are firing at them only thing is
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.920]  our current military illegitimate right now it is a totally new order
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:14.600]  run it's I mean look Obama and this was Bush to look it was in the Dallas
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.000]  Morning News that Rob Allen and co the big PR firm that Carl Roeb hired to run
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.040]  Bush's gubernatorial runs in Texas twice and his presidential run what were the
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:28.400]  ones that told him wear white t-shirts have American flags and go out in
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:34.280]  protest and then the media are Bush the White House ran that with Calderon
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.920]  okay and before that with the Sinti Fox I mean that is on record it's all
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:44.120]  treason sir and Obama is continuing it it is just it is it think about how
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.760]  citizens get pulled over and our blood gets taken at warrantless checkpoints
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:52.480]  and nobody complains the ACLU doesn't complain but then the bill which I've
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:56.760]  read on air the subsection says if they pull over a group of people and there's
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:00.880]  alcohol or their speeding and they ask for ID and they don't have it and they're
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.440]  illegal aliens they are to arrest them that is that is in the bill it isn't
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:10.280]  run around and arrest brown people that's another hoax it's all a hoax I
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:23.160]  appreciate your call it's insane all right I'm gonna go to Tony and Senna or
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:30.640]  Santa Harvey pronounced it Helen Gabriel others but I mean do you think I
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:33.840]  like getting up here and going against the political correctness knowing
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  there's tens of millions of dumbed-down Americans that think of if you so much as
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.400]  want to have a medical test on somebody coming in with leprosy oh yeah that's
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:48.880]  come out in the news there were no cases of leprosy in 2000 in Texas and by 2005
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:56.640]  there were 7,000 cases in Texas that was in the news and I'm evil and I'm
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.800]  racist and I'm bad and and then people bowed down to that and oh now if you're
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:07.960]  against government health carrier racist well you know what I'm done I'm done
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:12.640]  with being bullied by that that's not what it's about it's about survival and
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:18.120]  everybody knows it everybody knows it I mean look at Obama's labor chief says
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:25.520]  illegals have right to fair wages what what what they're illegal kick them out
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:32.880]  arrest their employers don't don't don't don't see I mean use them as a
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.200]  political force all selectively enforced all right I'm gonna shut up when
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.040]  come back from break I'm gonna go to your phone calls quicker I'm gonna try to
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:47.600]  and I've got all the news about the attack on Iran it gets worse by the
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.880]  minute this is it folks this is the world government takeover and they're
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:56.640]  gonna use a war in the middle of this financial and military and open border
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:00.280]  takeover as a political distractions the average American stops looking around
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:05.320]  them and salutes the flag as the ship goes down but before we go back to your
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.600]  calls just for three minutes I want to bring Ted up because gold is again at
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:13.640]  all-time highs last time I checked it was up $7 this morning and I haven't
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.000]  even talked to Ted yet today I don't know what he has left at the lower prices
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.560]  it keeps going up Ted keeps offering lower prices it's in the news financial
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:24.800]  times of London and London Guardian record amounts billions and billions of
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:31.480]  pounds of gold in British sterling being bought by the Rothschilds the Saudi
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:36.440]  Arabian royalty this House of Saud the foreign news is reporting doubled its
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:43.960]  holdings of gold overnight so the elites are now rushing into gold and I
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:50.120]  don't maybe that's as they can hoard it and then dump on the market to try to
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:54.120]  manipulate or maybe they've decided to go in let gold go up I mean clearly well
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.480]  Ted Anderson a lot's going on what do you think about all these elites rushing
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.800]  into gold well it's certainly the trend right now the elite is getting into gold
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.760]  I mean everybody knows that the United States dollar is under attack and the
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:09.200]  elite people are the ones that are attacking it so I mean the Federal
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:12.640]  Reserve system is trying to figure out how to put more deposits into the bank
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.680]  so we don't have bank runs you know before when we had oh yeah I forgot in
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:20.040]  fact guys I didn't see it in my stack I forgot to I am it sorry to interrupt Ted
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:25.560]  well you guys print bank runs in Spain it's mainstream news I forgot oh yeah
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.000]  there's bank runs in Spain Ted I know it I know it and then and that's the
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.960]  whole thing I mean if it wasn't for the printing press there'd be bank runs
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.600]  right here in the United States I guess that's why they put the Federal Reserve
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.440]  system into place you know so to speak to stop that kind of a thing from
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:45.080]  happening quietly bleed us out through inflation exactly that's what that's the
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.720]  offset to that that's why everybody who has half a brain or is getting out of
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.800]  the paper dollars in the conventional type investments and they're getting into
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.520]  gold and silver and and and quite frankly they should I mean honestly I mean
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.920]  what to think about it I mean what are you doing with my by putting your money
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:07.440]  in the bank you're financing this oligarchy of you know I mean elite
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.920]  people I it just it drives me crazy Alex I mean especially I mean I listen to
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.280]  your show and just look at the news and the information that I see and you know
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:20.600]  that we're just handing over our wealth over this institution and then they
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:23.960]  everything is intensifying Ted it's like you just reminded me of the Spanish
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.200]  bank runs people remind me of the plot to blow up a damn that would kill at
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:33.320]  least 10,000 people with major towns below it I mean this is insane I can't
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.120]  even keep track of it anymore Ted it's all happening they're moving at once I
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.800]  know and I know it and it's it's it's insane like you said now Alex I'm
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.920]  holding that frank coin down same price that I had before gold ran up over
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:54.320]  1260 right now gold is up over $7 it's seen as high as 1243 today the market
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.720]  took a little bit of a correction and and you know it that's what it does when
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:02.000]  it has a run-up there's a little bit of a back off a lot of the times that's
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.560]  manipulation but from the open market committee or also the plunge protection
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.360]  team trying to shore up the insane deal on the Frank you still have
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:14.080]  buffalos yep still have buffalos they'll have American Eagles still got those
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.400]  great deals on silver half dollars yep the silver half dollars at 975 with
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.640]  silver jumping over $19 an ounce is such a steal it's not even funny so if you
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.440]  were looking for something in silver that would be a great way to get involved
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:33.960]  let me fire up the number before we go to break 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 folks
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.800]  it's time to stop screwing around here's the headline out of the economic
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.480]  policy journal bank run in Spain is destabilizing ramifications for the
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:47.200]  entire EU instead here they're just evaluating the currency and mass printing
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.680]  the others evidence they're starting to slow down on that protect yourself in
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:56.920]  gold and silver today 800 686 2237 Ted finish up for the offer on the other

[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.880]  that'll cause a constitutional fight or crisis saying there's no six month
[01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:31.760]  moratorium on oil drilling and the way they define deep drilling is it really
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.680]  shallow drilling you want to see your oil go up to 7-8 dollars a gallon at the
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:42.320]  gas pump you want to see your gasoline cost that it's asinine folks we are
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.280]  based on oil yes it's got some problems but the globalists claim they're trying
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:50.280]  to bring in new clean energies in every case I do research they're blocking it
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:54.000]  the World Bank the IMF the federal government has bought up thousands of
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.920]  inventions I saw one just two weeks ago that Rob Jacobson brought me he first
[01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:02.840]  saw an article in the Economist then he went and searched it and found the
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.240]  actual World Bank document he gave it to me and I never got to but I read the
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:11.920]  article and you can go pull this stuff up for this solar generator that's just
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:17.200]  these big metal cylinders that grab heat from the sun and then go into a system
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.480]  and they're super cheap they create masses of power and the MIT developed
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.200]  it and then the World Bank came and bought it and now again the World Bank
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:30.960]  is our money but you notice it's always in key operations swindling people and
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.480]  won't let it be deployed for the public I mean they just literally have
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.360]  warehouses of inventions and systems that are kept from the world it's like
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:42.480]  the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark where they take the Ark into that giant
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:48.120]  endless warehouse and that's a good allegory for it they're not look I it'd
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:51.200]  be great to get off oil ladies and gentlemen it is dirty it does have
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.160]  problems but we're based on it and all they're gonna do is give you carbon
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:00.000]  taxes and rip you off and let other countries drill out there it's only
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.920]  America that can't drill it's Obama tying our hands because of that
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.320]  multinational company BP that's literally bankrolled him and Al Gore behind all the
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.400]  global governance funding the carbon taxes it's always BP by the way you
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.400]  guys find that clip I was telling you about where the BP vice president for
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:19.200]  global governance to talk about global government and it's on the screen it's
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:23.720]  his global government I know we reposted to the Facebook account you know what
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.600]  call Watson get me Watson on the line I just want him to write an article with
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.200]  all the BP TV ads calling for world government and carbon tax and pointing
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.880]  out that they're the biggest greeny weeners in the universe and that and
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:39.240]  that they stage this here's another one Louisiana police pullover activists at
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:45.240]  behest of BP this is treason this is Mother Jones confirmed now BP is such a
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:50.040]  God that there have the police harassing citizens for them because they've got
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:57.480]  full Obama mafia backing Ted I'm sorry I'm ranting it's just it's really hard
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:01.720]  for me I may have to go to Louisiana I mean I'm not gonna have some BP thug let
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.560]  them arrest me I'm sick of the cops I'm sick of the mafia when the police
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:11.280]  follow the orders of BP mafia and pull citizens over to be interrogated by BP
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:15.040]  because they dare videotape on that's treason you're not a cop anymore you're
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.000]  a thug you're a criminal I don't care if you got a 10 badge that again you're
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  just a cowardly citizen see they like pulling you over and slapping you
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.400]  around but some Mexican cartel that's actually got a gun they run you know they
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:30.680]  run to the outhouse because they poop themselves I'm sorry to get graphic here
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:36.320]  but the police have to work diapers in Arizona in South Texas but not when they
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.400]  deal with a cowardly American Ted Anderson I'm sick of it Ted tell folks
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.320]  about the other coins you've gotten the offer because it's so important people
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:47.720]  to protect themselves well again Alex I mean the Frank at 265 and when you get
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:51.560]  that full year subscription to the forecaster with it I mean that is so
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.520]  low it's ridiculous I mean it's bringing gold back down below four five
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:59.000]  hundred dollars an ounce I mean you're not gonna buy it anywhere else for that
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.160]  kind of a price best place right here at Midas twenty dollar liberties are good
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:08.120]  at fifteen hundred and forty seven dollars that eagle that you mentioned
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.920]  what about junk silver I mean but quite literally the walking Liberty half at
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.360]  975 when I regularly person they're closer to eleven dollars so I'd give us
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:22.160]  a call I mean right now is a good time those are really insane deals folks
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:25.440]  research the deals Ted's offering find out what a good deal they are for
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:29.320]  yourself and then purchase I buy it not as an investment though people are
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.320]  saying it's a great investment obviously I get it as a hedge against inflation and
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:38.120]  depression eight hundred six eight six two two three seven thank you Ted eight

[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.240]  mind
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:29.840]  all right my friends we are continuing with your phone calls let's talk to
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:33.560]  Helen in Canada you're on the air Helen welcome
[02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:39.520]  Hi Alex. Hi. There's definitely a war on for our mind and it's been going on for a
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:48.120]  long time in Canada in my province where I live just last week when I attended
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.760]  our school board meeting where I'm allowed to speak for three minutes and no
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:59.880]  longer there's a global government process is policy one global governing
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:05.400]  style is policy number two and now the board of trustees which has been a long
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:13.400]  time they're just puppets and it's all controlled by either the province or
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:17.840]  more probably but and by the feds and beyond. Well let me just add I mean this
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.840]  happened twice in the last two years where the Parliament didn't vote the way
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:26.960]  the Queen wanted on taxes and regulations and on open borders unlimited
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:33.440]  immigration and the Queen had her governor general activate and just take
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:37.960]  control and the media kept it real quiet it was in a few newspapers and of
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:41.880]  course just a few months before that I'd been on a CBC radio show with them
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:46.280]  laughing at me saying the governor general will never trump our Parliament
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:50.120]  here as I was talking about him doing it previously in Australia and then it
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:54.840]  happened right after that and since then I've been on national CBC radio and the
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:59.920]  hostess had to admit yes we're totally run by the Queen. See the Queen one of
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:06.800]  her sons owns the biggest publishing and TV production company that puts out all
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:12.920]  the I mean almost all of the main scandal rags and they report on
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:17.240]  themselves how they're pathetic and stupid and have no money but it's this
[02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:22.240]  cute little thing that the British like to have kind of for tourism okay and
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:28.120]  it's a total Psyop and of course her real money is a state secret show is it a
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:33.320]  state secret the Queen Beatrix her cousin over in the Netherlands so I
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:41.640]  mean literally she runs this country now she runs Canada she runs and again I
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:46.760]  was watching Sherlock Holmes the new Sherlock Holmes and it's all what really
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:51.120]  is going on. Satanists are running things though all the top British
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:54.760]  lords that are in the government not the general lords but the top British lords
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:00.520]  are Satanists they're into Luciferianism and they've secretly taken America back
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:05.640]  over and they orchestrated the civil war in the US to break America up but
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:09.120]  Sherlock Holmes stops them well it's actually on record the British finance
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.200]  the South and put troops in the north and I'm not saying I'm for the north
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.520]  folks nobody was a winner here they were manipulating both sides that's the
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.120]  point we're always taught to believe one side or the other and here they are
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:25.760]  just throwing real history in our face in a Hollywood movie just amazing but
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:30.200]  but that is the reality we have been taken over by British intelligence and
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.520]  that's what the CFR is go ahead.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:38.520]  Oh in addition to this there's a little article in the paper and says Pope begs for forgiveness
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:43.360]  for forgiveness for child sex abuse so this is Club of Rome and the
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:48.360]  other the response was inherently problematic because of the church's
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:54.920]  ancient unhealthy monarchical structures so that substantiates what you have just
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:03.360]  said well it's it's incredible that's amazing I mean any type of society or
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:07.320]  organization that doesn't let men get married you're gonna end up having men
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:12.920]  having sex with men I mean look at historically with sailors and pirates
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:16.680]  no matter whatever was Asian pirates Anglo pirates there ended up being a lot
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:24.680]  of that going on and I mean and then you've got these men over kids what's
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:28.800]  gonna happen I mean it's terrible and it needs to be exposed I appreciate your
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:34.520]  call let's go ahead and talk to Gabriel in New York Gabriel you're on the air

[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.920]  as a activist point what I did was I printed up a hundred off keeper
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:19.240]  flyers I handed them out to all the military guys in my town and a lot of
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:23.080]  people were very receptive to that and a few even came back to me and said thank
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.400]  you well good job but but I mean let me illustrate something here and I did
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:32.560]  get your photos Kentucky Derby Super Bowl high school football high school
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:37.840]  basketball baseball small events you know in the middle of rural areas even they
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:42.680]  will have snipers on roofs they will have checkpoints they'll have regular
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:48.680]  army or National Guard there and they act like everybody's a suspect terrorist
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:52.040]  and you get their internal training manuals who are they looking for gun
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:56.240]  owners conservatives libertarians especially veterans this is all on
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.600]  record for those that just joined us myac report homeland security and we
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:03.760]  broke that last year but we covered that for years with separate documents it
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.040]  just happened to become national news finally so people understood meanwhile
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:13.440]  80 to 100 miles into Arizona mass murders houses being burned the police
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:17.960]  saying we've lost control drug dealers illegal aliens in fact roll some of that
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:22.120]  video from the news of just illegals climbing over everything cars shootouts
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:28.600]  dead bodies I mean this is bedlam plots to blow up a dam in south Texas that's a
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:35.120]  WHO AI television and the Houston Chronicle I mean just total lawless
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:42.040]  bedlam but meanwhile no police no military and and the dominant news
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.840]  says it's not a problem and then senator Kyle says he's in a meeting with Obama
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:50.800]  last month and Obama said I'm gonna leave the borders open and we want this
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.880]  crime we're holding the people hostage this is senator Kyle we're letting the
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:00.680]  crisis develop was Obama's words so we can pass immigration reform I mean this
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:08.880]  is an admission of false flag terror this is so huge anything else Gabriel of
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.800]  course actually I still have a few things I want to bring up for the 4th
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:16.800]  of July coming up I have an idea short-term achievements for long-term
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:21.280]  solutions that's a campaign slogan I'm working on I'm giving a call out to
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:26.400]  every we are change chapter to everybody in general this 4th of July pick up as
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:30.640]  many pocket constitutions as you possibly can citizens rule books which you
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.160]  know you can pick up an info or wherever and let's get them out to the
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:37.840]  people and every 4th of July we need to start giving out constitutions to people
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:42.000]  we need to level the playing field to allow people to know their rights how
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.200]  are we going to have a discussion with people they don't even know if their
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:47.480]  rights are to begin with to even know they're having their rights taken away
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:52.000]  and that's something that we all need to start doing every 4th of July and every
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.120]  election period right before the election takes place and well said a
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:03.120]  well said Gabriel good to hear from you keep it up let's talk to Jason in Texas
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:09.200]  Jason you're on the air yeah Alex I'm a special operations veteran post-911 and
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.520]  after I got out of spec ops I actually stepped over into security contracting
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:20.440]  before I did I actually viewed a lot of your documentaries and stuff and when
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:25.280]  I when I went over actually when I went through the training I spoke to a lot
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:28.640]  of guys who were you know ex-special ops and they were all going over for
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:33.040]  security contracting specifically just for the money because the money's good
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:37.320]  and the economy was bad and and a lot of these guys are aware but when I went
[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:44.640]  over I I let a lot of guys see these good documentaries I want to end game
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:50.000]  Bohemian Grove all of these videos that you have constructed Terra Storm and
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  before I worked over there for you know in Iraq for approximately two years and
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  before I'd left I mean I had your videos out at approximately maybe 30 guys and
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:08.040]  these guys completely had changed their initial views everybody but you know why
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:12.040]  they changed I want to hold you over but to interrupt they changed because they
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.600]  already knew what I was telling them they're not stupid people already
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:19.240]  subconsciously spiritually and intellectually already have all the
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.800]  pieces and and nothing makes sense for mainstream media then when you actually
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:27.960]  start looking at globalist documents the globalist all openly talk about what
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.920]  they're doing to each other and they think we're so stupid they're miscalculation
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.360]  is their battle plan is public this is naked what we're facing but but that's
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.040]  the same Intel I get and I see on the street I can't tell you how many times
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:44.760]  I have Fort Hood troops who are in Austin eating dinner and see me on the
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:48.400]  street or something when I'm out and I've even had a Colonel run over and say
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:51.920]  look don't you know don't say my name on air but a lot of us are awake at Fort
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:57.840]  Hood and just huge amounts of troops are aware and awake that's why the system
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.080]  is wanting to shift to gangbangers foreigners because there's then that
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:05.720]  language gap but the word is my videos are all over the place because of people
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:10.600]  like you please continue yeah no I mean exactly what you said right now and a
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:15.160]  lot of the tools that I was able to show them you know documents that were
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:21.080]  declassified the stuff that you talk about I was able to pull up on PDFs and
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:25.400]  actually show them these declassified and for me you know the risk because
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:29.560]  obviously we work with security clerks is and all that kind of stuff and and so
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:34.560]  when I went out on a limb and and it looked the people's mindset just like
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:38.000]  you said they are they do have a weird feeling about things and then when they
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.800]  received the information it only confirms that so in in my chow halls and
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:44.760]  stuff we'd be sitting there and initially everybody be watching Fox News
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.840]  just gobbling it up like you know grits and and then by the end of it before I'd
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.120]  left this last year I had you know the guys that I've been there for the last
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:57.640]  two years they were analyzing the propaganda they were they were able to
[02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:01.920]  see it they were discerning it exactly and then and then once you show somebody
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:06.280]  we don't tell people what to think once you show them there's an agenda then the
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:11.120]  propaganda only irritates and motivates resistance that's what I found and we're
[02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:14.400]  going to kick these people's butts that's why they're blowing oil wells and
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:18.840]  about to start a new war and trying to bankrupt us because we're going to beat
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:24.400]  them if we decide we're going to beat them exactly I mean I hope people realize
[02:19:24.400 --> 02:19:27.120]  that we're going to beat this new world order and kick them out of America and
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.400]  save this country and get a reprieve like Nineveh got our biggest problem is
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:34.760]  they've taught the Christian churches that it's the end of the world that it's
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:39.800]  a foregone conclusion and that it and that we are meant to lose look let's
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:43.640]  say I'm gonna lose next week I'm not joining evil I'm not giving into this
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:48.160]  I'm gonna fight these people no matter what it is so fine Jesus is coming back
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:52.440]  next month I'm gonna fight the new world order until the minute he arrives

[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:21.680]  you that's not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus

[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:10.520]  know it's not hyped to say we're waking up the military and the police and I
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:14.280]  know we reach out to them we can wake them up most of them are good men and
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:19.440]  women and I tend to do harm sometimes when I fly off the handle and start
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:23.600]  foaming at the mouth about police and military when I see them engaging in
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:29.280]  treason you know I got this AP video did you guys see the video I sent you the
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:34.280]  old woman and they go kill her little dog in her house and then the cops and
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:40.020]  the cops are defending themselves I mean her grandson hadn't lived there in
[02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:44.040]  12 years he's 28 years old now that's one of the last-owned addresses they've
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:49.000]  got they show up with a warrant and she she comes the door and she says let me
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.020]  put my dog in the bathroom and she puts the dog in the bathroom and it's a
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:55.920]  little dog I don't know what type it is they never say on the news it's like
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:06.040]  some little mutt it's it I mean there it is very vicious and they put in the
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:09.080]  bathroom in the cops went in the bathroom and it growled at them so they
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:13.440]  shot it that is standard procedure they call it dog-killing detail meanwhile in
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.240]  the name of stopping drugs the government literally ships the majority of
[02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:23.000]  them on record now they won't stop what's happening on our borders where it's
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.480]  just total bedlam because there's people shooting back folks I mean since when did
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:34.520]  Americans become so cowardly if you're going to have a law about drugs what are
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:38.960]  you doing trying to bust some guy who may have a quarter ounce of marijuana why
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:42.880]  aren't you going after the people that are bringing tons of cocaine in art I'm
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:47.400]  done talking about it see I start talking about how I don't want to be angry at
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:51.120]  the police and military but then I get angry just thinking about it but it's
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:55.360]  the leadership it's the policies it's how they've been directed I mean look at
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:00.000]  this article this is Mother Jones and we've already seen reports of this in
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:04.760]  the news Louisiana police pullover activists at behestive BP everyone knows
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:09.840]  how the BP is still blocking press access to the oil spill sites even though
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:12.760]  they're not supposed to anymore yeah that's on record the police have been
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:16.480]  told by the way that that's illegal just to have some private contractor just
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:21.080]  claim no one can be on a beach I've been blathering about it for weeks and it's
[02:26:21.080 --> 02:26:27.400]  been all over three days since four contractors wouldn't let me through the
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  Ponty ox marina outside of Louisiana and though as of June 16th the federal
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:42.120]  government has been saying helicopters could fly reporters as low as 1,500
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:46.760]  feet around spill sites on June 17th I was on a helicopter that was prohibited
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:54.440]  from flying below 3,000 feet and whose pilot was flipped silent birds as the
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:27:00.800]  military guys coming over the radio and hassling him about being in the area at
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.880]  all so some type of electronic bird flipping I don't know that communication
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:09.840]  or nomenclature but Louisiana state police pulling over a video camera
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.560]  wielding private citizen because the head of BP security wanted to ask him
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:19.120]  some questions is a whole other level of alarming yeah folks I'm consulting on
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:25.640]  Ventura's hit TV show right now I am making my own film on eugenics and
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:32.120]  chemtrails right now I am doing radio interviews every day I'm not complaining
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:36.280]  I just really don't have time to go to Louisiana and then not be here on the
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:45.360]  radio I mean do you I mean do you not want me to be here I guess I could try
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:49.080]  to take some digital gear and do the show from there but then I'm sitting
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:52.640]  there four hours a day I guess that's the answer in fact just go ahead now and
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:59.200]  get speed order the because we've got one that's in the rack but a comrex unit
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:03.640]  that's portable then I got to find hotels that don't have phone lines or
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:06.440]  digital lines that put gates on because we've hooked them up before and then it
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:10.440]  in the hotel firewall won't let you connect and I'm not complaining it's
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:13.400]  just it's a nightmare you're sitting there for an hour or two trying to get
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:17.680]  connected to the network then maybe it's not a good connection you know maybe
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:21.760]  it's breaking up sometimes I mean the Skype connection we have to England is
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:25.840]  phenomenal it sounds like broadcast radio that's why we're having Paul Watson
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:33.280]  of course now he's moving to another city in England but his girlfriend's
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:38.160]  getting her PhD in another city but watch I bet his Skype doesn't work well
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:42.680]  from the new location but I was like finally you know I've got somebody who
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.360]  could fill in for me who's intelligent and sounds great so we'll see how long
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:53.640]  that lasts but I'm already digressing here it's just I read stuff like this I
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:59.480]  want to go directly to where this happened oh you want to ask me questions
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.480]  officer yeah I've noticed when you cal though the cops like think it's normal
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:06.680]  it's like you're pulling me over with a video camera because BP wants to know
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:11.200]  I'm here to cover this haven't you heard the big international scandal that all
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:16.120]  these reporters were forced off beaches by police under BP orders and that you've
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:20.040]  been told and been told even by the president and the governors not to do
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:23.880]  this what is your name and if I get a hot-headed cop on Royds will probably
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:27.360]  just kill me right there I mean you know Lord know I'm an evil American who
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:31.640]  wants to be able to go tell people what's happening at the Gulf and who wants
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:35.080]  to bring BP to justice isn't that what you want I mean how do they get cops to
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:41.000]  act like this what planet do they find these lunatics on wake up now I know a
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.200]  lot of cops are cool and maybe they're scared for their jobs and want to follow
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:47.880]  these orders but that doesn't cut it man you know how many sacrifices I've made
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:55.360]  to not compromise unbelievable we're on the march the empires on the run Alex

[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:09.760]  wrinkles you see all the bullet holes by eight bullet holes all up and down the
[02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:13.680]  steps of bullets everywhere Marietta Robinson says officers showed up with
[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:17.760]  a search warrant for drugs in relation to her 28 year old grandson and she let
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:23.360]  them in her house under one condition I asked his permission may I put my dog in
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:27.200]  the bathroom or in the backyard he said go ahead and put in the bathroom we're
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:30.800]  not gonna hurt her but wrinkles was killed anyway after an officer opened the
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:34.360]  bathroom door they start shooting the dog and I screamed and I backed up and I
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:37.800]  went around this way and I'll say please don't shoot a police say the dog
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:42.480]  attacked an officer Robinson says officers even used her water cooler
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:46.600]  after killing her dog they washed their hands in my drinking water Robinson says
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:49.880]  the shooting never had to happen because her grandson hasn't lived in her home
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:53.840]  for 12 years my grandson couldn't be coming he cuz having lived in so long
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:57.920]  my dog don't know my grandson we look through the whole incident police are
[02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:01.560]  investigating to see if any policies were violated they can't bring me my
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:05.080]  dog back I don't want no apology they need to be fired and get somebody on the
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:08.560]  job that know what they're doing Robinson says police told her they found
[02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:13.880]  bags with drug residue inside she says they're fortune cookie wrappers my
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:24.280]  relatives the Associated Press they found some fortune cookie wrappers I've
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:28.800]  seen them SWAT team of Patriot because they have an American flag or Gadsden
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:33.400]  flag sticker on their car I've got a clip of this from road to tyranny from the
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.040]  news choppers and the police then tell them yes we found a pipe bomb and they
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:41.440]  showed jumper cables and it came out in court and they had to drop the case the
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:46.400]  fellow's name was feral Montgomery out in Arizona so they pull over somebody's
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:50.080]  got an American flag on their car or don't tread on me sticker I mean they're
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:54.120]  they're gonna get beaten they tasered him let the police dog while he was on
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:57.360]  the ground being tasered biting he didn't resist he got out with his hands up
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:03.920]  and then they said oh we better frame him see police why do you act like this
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:07.960]  well why have you been trained to hate Americans they're like attack dogs that
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:11.560]  have been trained if they see an American or a Patriot they're bad and the
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:15.120]  Southern Parvy Law Center ADL has taught them this now a lot of cops are
[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:22.600]  waking up but a lot of them aren't and we now have this incredible video from
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:27.000]  Senator Kyle up on info wars comm in prison planet calm I want to play that
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.880]  one more time before we go to Alan watt because the first issue I want to raise
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:39.560]  with him do we have that video senator kyle ready great
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:50.600]  great and in that senator kyle video he he's and the audio is not too good but
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:54.440]  it's video to town hall he clearly says I was in a closed-door meeting with
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:36:00.040]  obama he says I kicked everybody out and he said well I didn't kick out general
[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:03.680]  Jones he's the head of national security but I asked him to leave and I said
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.560]  Obama why are you doing this and Obama said we need to continue the crisis down
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.120]  there so people will give us immigration reform which means total
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:14.400]  amnesty then they just legalize all the illegals and then the feds claim they're
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:17.360]  going to secure the borders and that's what they've been telling the states for
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:21.840]  the last five years that's really the bush policy which is the CFR policy so
[02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:25.400]  you've got the border completely collapsing Mexico is a failed state all
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:28.640]  these murders sheriffs calling for help saying they're being attacked they're
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:33.520]  being killed 80 to 100 miles into Arizona past Tucson you can't go in the
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:38.120]  national parks as the illegals have just taken it over as drug corridors all of
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:45.200]  this is going on so they have a crisis and can say look at the problem we need
[02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:50.480]  amnesty to fix it so let's go ahead and play that clip
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:59.680]  why I'll tell you why I met with the president in the old office just the two
[02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:04.840]  of us I kicked the rest of people out I asked him if they would leave I'm sorry
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:08.480]  and we had a discussion about it
[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:17.560]  no one was general Jones and that's what the president said the problem is he said
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:24.000]  if we secure the border then you won't have any reason to support comprehensive
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:32.200]  immigration reform in other words they don't want to secure the border unless
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:35.680]  until it is combined with comprehensive immigration
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:43.720]  and then he goes on from there why is this important it's another admission of
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.440]  problem reaction solution thousands are dead on the US side 20 plus thousand on
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:51.960]  the Mexican side most of it on the Texas Arizona border some of the
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:57.560]  California New Mexico and I mean that is dereliction of duty that is aiding
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:02.920]  and abetting murder and lawlessness and chaos but this is the entire modus
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:08.400]  operandi of the globalist so we go now to Alan Watt for the balance of the
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:12.360]  radio broadcast the next hour and 20 minutes 22 minutes Alan Watt is a
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.880]  long-term researcher into the causative forces behind major changes in
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.720]  historical development and I found his research is spot-on his background is
[02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:26.320]  that of a Renaissance man with a background in three professions plus
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:29.680]  having various books published in religion philosophy poetry mainly
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:34.720]  under pseudonyms for much of his life he has been heavily involved in the music
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:39.120]  industry songwriter singer performer involved in folk music blues pop rock
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:43.680]  even classical also known for his session guitar work he has played with
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.120]  some of the best well-known artists and groups born in Scotland he watched the
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:51.800]  subtleties of politics in the media as they guided the population of the UK
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:56.400]  covertly into the European Algamation he has been warning the North American
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:00.280]  people for some years now that the same process of amalgamation is being carried
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:04.320]  out with historical documentation he shows how cultures are created and
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:07.920]  altered by those in control also to lead the people like sheep into the next
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:13.560]  pasture the next phase learn the true esoteric meanings of mystery religions
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:18.960]  from one who knows and of course his websites cuttingthematrix.com and he's
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:24.840]  a big part of our new film fall of the Republic available on DVD at info wars
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:30.400]  dot com and he is in the upcoming chemtrail slash eugenics masterpiece
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:33.840]  that I've been really making the last three years since in game in the
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:37.640]  background and we've now decided to release it in October and so he's also
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:41.760]  gonna be part of that but he is with us today and we're gonna be taking your
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:45.720]  calls continually into the next hour but Alan so much is going on I want to
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:48.880]  talk to you about Tavistock Institute one of the premier mind control
[02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:53.160]  organizations how the media works your take on the BP oil spill the fact that
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:56.280]  they're more and more admitting the chemtrailing is going on but hiding it
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:01.000]  in plain view the fact that the police and military are waking up how you see
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.120]  the system trying to keep them under their brainwashing control what the
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:08.960]  next phase of the economic collapses so much to discuss today but out of the
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:13.080]  gates you heard me play the clip of the cops come to the house kill the small
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:17.400]  dog it's an act of dominance just like naked body scanners are an act of
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:20.960]  dominance even if the police are unconscious this is why they've been
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:25.320]  given this training and the and the illustration though of Obama saying
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:31.160]  openly to a senator we're using this crisis all this crime and murder that's
[02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:35.960]  going on by contesting some of the private cartels not laundering their
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:39.160]  money through us banks knowing it would cause the crisis we covered this five
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:43.880]  years ago we're using that crisis to bring in our North American Union and
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:50.840]  this is an amazing admission Alan what yeah it's common to that so many of them
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.320]  Hillary Clinton said the same thing to a while back would use this crisis if you
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:58.720]  find the members of the council on foreign relations saying the same thing
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.120]  never let a good crisis go to waste because there is an agenda and the
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:09.440]  agenda must go forth regardless they will use anything at all including that
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:13.560]  of course there's a spill in the Gulf as well they're using that to get the
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:18.320]  sustainable development and carbon tax agendas through as well so these guys
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:22.640]  literally will use every crisis that comes along and if they can't find one
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:28.920]  they'll make one yeah Alan let's let's go into that first because I haven't talked
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:32.480]  to you in a few months on air I think I interviewed you right before the oil
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:40.400]  spill break down what you think is happening there and what they plan to
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:47.400]  get out of it for the viewers and listeners well this new world order
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:50.960]  and this case we're going through now apart from the amalgamations of whole
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:54.760]  continents together and remember the NAFTA the North Flaugret memorandum
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.440]  pre-trade agreement is still rushing ahead it still has to have one more
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:03.600]  signature put on by the president and the president and the prime ministers of
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.600]  Canada and Mexico and that's legally binding and that's the fifth legal
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:13.680]  agreement so that's on the go we also have the sustainable development which
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:19.440]  is the whole way to control the world really rushing forward in Britain for
[02:42:19.440 --> 02:42:23.400]  instance in other countries that pass laws already that the European Union pass
[02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:30.640]  laws that come 2018 to 2020 all homes built must be sustainable and they're
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.920]  going to start finding those homes which are not thermal approved and all the
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:40.360]  rest of it this is neo feudalism this is total serfdom to to literally engage in
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:45.640]  siege as they state to cut off our energy our calories so we cannot have
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:49.960]  children and we are total creatures of the states while the elite like Al Gore
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:55.120]  live in their giant mansions and are exempt from all the rules absolutely
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:00.960]  and they're using every environmental reason to push it ahead they set up the
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:05.920]  carbon tax phenomenon quite a few years back they're already trading carbon
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:09.760]  tax look at how for 20 years in the u.s. they try to restrict farmers and
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:14.000]  ranchers from building new barns are you know supposedly if there's ever a
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.680]  puddle during the year they call it a wetland I mean we know their intent these
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:23.400]  are vicious vicious criminals yeah they do believe that they have the right as
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:30.240]  an elite to to recreate the world and the image they should be such we made in
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:35.480]  and the democracy is too cumbersome to get their agendas through so they must
[02:43:35.480 --> 02:43:39.520]  destroy democracy and they do so by bringing in new regulations and new
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:45.480]  laws and new rules we adapt into them step by step by acquiescing to them and
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:50.560]  that becomes the new law the new way of living and we're doing it all the time
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.400]  incrementally and they make it sexy they financed top Hollywood people in the
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:59.920]  last decade going to these zero footprint spas and resorts which is fine
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:03.960]  I mean that would be interesting but that's to sell it to where then when
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:09.040]  you're made to do it it's okay with you and they admit this is to destroy our
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:14.760]  society now that absolutely they've made quite plain in their own writings in
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:18.960]  the communiques with each other we put the top environmentalists coming out
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:25.960]  now at saying that democracy has to be put on hold now for the environmental
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:29.480]  crisis and for the crisis with the food shortages coming it's all this kind of
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:33.080]  stuff and by the way they are bringing on food shortages because they have put
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:37.680]  so many farmers out of business really since World War two that's right now the
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:41.920]  UN again to back you up the UN who in their own State Department random 200 in
[02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:45.720]  their own documents in the 70s said we're gonna cut off food bring in GMO
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:49.920]  start wars get people fighting with each other in different regions now they come
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:53.960]  out and say food prices are gonna go up by 40% in the next three years oh my
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:58.080]  gosh there's a huge shortage and then they always poses the savior for the
[02:44:58.080 --> 02:45:03.240]  crisis they've created yes and they've already jacked up the prices of food
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:09.040]  twice already in the last few years to do what it was and people don't really
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:13.840]  notice they again adjust incrementally tie it step by step into this new system
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:19.320]  and five agri-food businesses have been given the power of controlling the entire
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:24.640]  food supply off the planet so it's quite easy to bring on a crisis it's easy to
[02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:28.920]  bring on rationing which they will do by the way as they bring us into the new
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:33.240]  system see we're supposed to serve the new system as you say it's a feudal
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.560]  system Cal quickly said that it says that this to be a new feudal system with
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:42.560]  the CEOs being the new feudal overlords in collusion with government and it's
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:47.840]  to be a scientifically run society and not something that's debated on emotions
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:54.000]  and that's the the that is what the new world order is basically H.G. Wells
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.400]  wrote about sit back in the 1920s in his own book he called it a modern
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:03.200]  utopia he said gradually it is rather than to kill off all those who are unfit
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:08.120]  and the ones with the lower IQs the lower classes who will no longer be
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:13.120]  required in a post-industrial society he says we shall simply sterilize them and
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:18.080]  allow them to die off gradually peacefully so this is the ongoing
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:22.040]  agenda we've been going through for over a hundred years now and people don't
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:26.400]  know that they think they're born into a system which must be normal on a basis
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:30.520]  that it exists but nothing is further from the truth it's not normal it's a
[02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:35.560]  planned society we get no peace if you notice not one single generation has
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:41.000]  been allowed any kind of peace for an awful long time and if they're not
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  getting new economic wars and depressions and recessions and layoffs
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.800]  they're giving you actual physical wars and sometimes both combined this is
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:55.120]  their technique as order out of chaos they create the chaos and they get their
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:47:01.800]  way no sooner had the bourbon wall gone down and and a few years right away
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:05.920]  basically we've got a Gulf War one on the go as they go across there to grab
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:12.160]  all the oil this is an ongoing war really since the 1990 and people don't
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:24.640]  realize that well Alan suddenly when you read the news it's just everywhere oh
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:27.600]  we've got to reduce the world population we can only have one child
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:31.680]  suddenly Peter singers in the New York Times who calls humans a disease and a
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:35.680]  cancer saying maybe we're the last generation that was the headline maybe
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:42.120]  no children should be the law and again it's sold and in MTV and the colleges
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:47.880]  is as cool and fun they're selling people pure death and there's this
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:50.720]  attitude where they train the yuppies that feel like they're part of the
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:55.760]  establishment to giggle and laugh about their enslavement believing that
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:59.920]  because they laugh and giggle about it and have smart mouth comments about it
[02:47:59.920 --> 02:48:04.600]  that somehow they're part of it what do you call that phenomenon because I've
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.000]  always noticed it and haven't heard really anybody else talk about it I was
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:11.800]  listening to Michael Savage last week and I heard him spend about 20 minutes
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:16.600]  when I was driving home ranting about how they hate life they hate money they
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:20.440]  hate wealth and anybody's hands with themselves they giggle they laugh how
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:25.560]  they're he called him curly haired you'll coke bottle you know highly
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:31.320]  intelligent deviance they're almost nihilist or like low-key saboteurs even
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:36.440]  the minions that serve the system know enough of the of the evil but they
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:41.720]  almost cheerlead it in and and and they hate beauty and they love macabre
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:47.280]  disease I mean what what are these creatures what you've got as an
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:52.840]  institutionalized sadomasochistic society and this is well proven with
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:57.480]  scientific studies on dictators and all those who follow and obey the
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:02.840]  dictators at the newberg trial for instance they found out that all of the
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:07.600]  officers immediately around adult Hitler still adored him up until their
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:13.640]  deaths they thought he was a god pretty well and and now ranking system of
[02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:17.880]  authority the psychopath admires the one with more power above them and
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:22.400]  despises the lesser beneath them so he's a statistic to the one beneath them
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:25.960]  and you have a deviant
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:31.040]  sadomasochistic system in operation today with everything that comes from
[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:36.320]  deviancy including into the perversions of the sexual area too that's rampant
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:40.960]  today it's top today in fact isn't as a new normal winning is normal now
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:45.280]  defeating people if you're defeated there's no such thing as well done you
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:49.600]  did your best they literally despise you they hate you they want to destroy you
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.880]  and if you could be groveled to them for help they will destroy you that is the
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:50:00.200]  system we're in you had a generation raised on power all a youngster will see
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:06.720]  today is the video games with the biggest monster beating all the rest and
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:11.240]  that's what he admires when he grows up he wants to be one the winning team all
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:16.440]  you see is it are the cops and all the cop movies with authority machine guns
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:20.840]  attack helicopters that kind of stuff that's what turns them on that's what
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:25.600]  he sees as being the normal to survive to win and that's what he becomes
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:30.080]  basically if you're not one of those you're one of the ordinary civilians is
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:35.760]  called even in the movies they show them the archetypal torturing beast and say
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:42.560]  this is the new hero this is the male model not a loving caring intelligent
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:48.600]  male who fights if they have to but you know is a inventor and a teacher and
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:52.480]  someone who has depth no they're teaching the young males be a mindless

[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:44.320]  of urgency because I'm genuinely feeling it and when Alan Watt many others I
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:49.360]  respect of course I could feel it my gut and see it intellectually as well said
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:52.800]  the quickening is now here a few years ago you're gonna see an acceleration
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:58.320]  it's one thing to psychologically and intellectually coldly understand we're
[02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:02.040]  going into the big plunge but it's another thing to actually now be living
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:08.800]  it and experiencing it going down this slide as it accelerates Alan Watt
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:13.360]  getting more into the oil spill and what you believe is behind that and now
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:19.440]  where all of this is going to go what your intel is on Iran they're openly
[02:55:19.440 --> 02:55:23.160]  saying they're going to attack it now just brazenly hiding it in plain view
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:29.800]  go over that for us well we know that the attack on Iran is a continuation of
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:35.360]  the same policy of the project for numeric and century they listed the
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:40.880]  countries they wanted to attack and they were in collusion with Israel starting
[02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:46.840]  with the said Afghanistan for the state then Iraq and followed by Iran and then
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:52.320]  Syria they have never veered off this agenda and the Israeli papers have
[02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:57.520]  actually printed this many times over the same sequence so that's an ongoing
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:02.320]  policy regardless of the changes of house and as Jefferson said when you see
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:06.560]  the same policies going through even though the House of Congress has changed
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:11.000]  with a new party he said then no then that you're under tyranny well we've been
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:16.240]  seeing the same policies for many many houses changes changes and the same
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:21.080]  policies go ahead regardless and into the scientific socialism as I said
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:25.120]  where express will guide or every move everything that we do even if we're
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:32.640]  born and that's what it's all about the Gulf idea they need a catastrophe they
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:37.720]  needed a catastrophe same as the 9-11 the numeric and century said we need
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.560]  something on the scale of Pearl Harbor to motivate the American public behind
[02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:46.440]  the war and bang down go the towers and we're off to war they needed to
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  something because the people were not go falling for the global warming scam
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:55.320]  there was too much exposed about their their fake statistics and so on the
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:57:00.480]  work they weren't going for this carbon taxes at the Copenhagen meeting and so
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:04.520]  they needed something about crisis to push it through and bingo you get this
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:08.400]  bill in the Gulf and sure enough they're using this as an excuse to start
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:15.760]  limiting energy and so on there's just to put 300 pounds extra taxes on every
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:20.920]  air flights going out of Britain to make up supposedly for the coming energy
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:25.320]  shortages as they see it this is all part of the same thing yeah how does a tax
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:30.160]  make up for that I mean how does a tax make up and and of course that was part
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:33.520]  of the Copenhagen Treaty is this new global authority with carbon taxes on
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:38.200]  flights and Obama is saying we've got to pass the carbon bill you know this tax
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:42.880]  will fix it and then all the evidence is they've been blocking the relief the
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:47.680]  people on the well were given orders by BP that they said would cause this
[02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:52.120]  spill to happen I mean this is more and more they're doing everything in plain
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.560]  view why do you think we've had them come out and admit that the CIA is putting
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:58:01.120]  out fake bin Laden videos in the in the Washington Post in the spy talk column
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:05.560]  which is an official CIA I mean Washington Post's admittedly CIA run and
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:10.480]  that's the spy column you know about spooks every week they admitted that
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:15.760]  there they come right out on Fox and admit yes we grow the opium why Alan
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:22.720]  when we come back are they just suddenly admitting everything I mean it's just
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:26.200]  incredible Alan want a whole next hour with this final hour and your phone
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:31.000]  calls Dan Al Aaron Monica JD about 15 minutes to the next hour we'll start
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.920]  taking your phone calls I talked to Jack McClam officer Jack McClam just over
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:38.360]  the phone last segment the last break he said he confirmed with his sources the
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:47.080]  BLM bombing the well-read thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN
[02:58:47.080 --> 02:58:53.240]  live comm today this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:57.480]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:58:57.480 --> 02:59:01.680]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:59:01.680 --> 02:59:05.600]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:59:05.600 --> 02:59:09.240]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:13.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:17.840]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:21.640]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:25.280]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:59:25.280 --> 02:59:29.640]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:32.760]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:36.440]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:42.000]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:46.760]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:51.600]  1-877-327-0365
[02:59:51.600 --> 03:00:00.760]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:24.040]  I ran attack moves forward I ran permitted the U.S. and Israel to score a
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:27.880]  propaganda victory Monday when refused to allow two international atomic
[03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:31.720]  energy agency inspectors entry to the country for an inspection of its nuclear
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:38.520]  program and it's now being used by the former head of Mossad to call for a
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:42.160]  preemptive strike with nukes on Iran that's what the rest of the Israeli
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:45.960]  government's calling for and a U.S. slash Israeli fleet is now off the coast of
[03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:50.800]  Iran and Israeli papers are saying that it they're preparing to start boarding
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:55.360]  Iranian ships and stopping goods going to the country which is an act of war so
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:59.640]  this could flare up today a week from now or a year from now but it's
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.920]  definitely on the front burner and this is so serious but going back to Alan
[03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:07.080]  Watt we'll talk more about that throughout the hour our researcher
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:11.400]  author Alan Watt Alan I was asking you the question of why are they so out in
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:15.440]  the open now I mean they've really shifted from admitting things more and
[03:01:15.440 --> 03:01:20.040]  more a few years ago but spinning it to just yeah the CIA fakes fake bin Laden
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:23.480]  videos in the Washington Post yeah the government's growing the opium and
[03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:28.800]  shipping and what's the big deal I mean the what is that tactic Alan Watt part
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:34.240]  of it is a tactic of the creation of empathy within the general populace
[03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:38.360]  quite when you're changing or shifting gears from one system to another and
[03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:43.680]  you're destroying all the old and you're increasing prices you got massive
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:47.760]  unemployment rates all of that kind of stuff you you give them a kind of
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:53.120]  skitside society again through all media on the one hand you turn on the
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:56.360]  television and things seem quite normal there's your favorite old shows and
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:01.000]  everything's okay and then you hear your schizophrenic news mixed with Hollywood
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.960]  and so on so all the horror that you're seeing is the drones hit the wrong
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:10.240]  villages in Pakistan kill people is mixed up with the latest boob job in
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:14.840]  some Hollywood bimbo everything becomes surrealistic and at the same time they
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:20.360]  hammer you with a new system ideas that subconsciously penetrate you that you're
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:25.000]  going into or you are into a new system and there's nothing you can do about it
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:30.160]  it's a creation of apathy mixed up with surrealism as a scientific technique
[03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:34.840]  actually intense very advanced psychological warfare on a grand scale
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:39.520]  and it's done through repetition we've been going through for quite a few years
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:44.160]  learned helplessness it's confusing people never in an old tribal situation
[03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:50.000]  5,000 years ago would you see happy bimbos cut into children dying and so
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:55.080]  it's not normal and so they're literally searing our neurons and programming us
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.000]  where we're a bunch of gibbering idiots and just can't even respond to real
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.920]  human activity as they reduce the language down where it's impossible now
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:07.240]  I mean I see people at grocery stores in the mall in the street even well to do
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:10.840]  people who literally cannot hold a conversation I mean they have been turned
[03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:15.600]  into sub-oids slaves they have it's linguistic minimalism so they can I
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.440]  cannot express ideas of even frustration never mind let's get ready for
[03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:24.200]  revolution and they all went through that whole technique very very well
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:28.640]  indeed you cannot express a thought to another person or a coherent idea or a
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:32.760]  plan and therefore nothing can come against those who are ruling you
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:37.080]  it's very advanced psychological warfare but Bertrand Russell and others
[03:03:37.080 --> 03:03:41.240]  said we have to create apathy amongst the public during this phase that's what
[03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:46.080]  you've got to an extent is a form of apathy it makes people feel powerless
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:49.840]  what can you do is the only thing that they can possibly say what can you do
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:55.400]  oh well and and everyone again is tied into a system as we're trained to like
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:04:00.200]  little animals to to work for this thing called money that keeps becoming more
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:06.360]  more diluted like water and everybody's afraid to lose a little bit
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:10.920]  that they have already even though those who the top are bringing you into
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:15.000]  this system that you where you will be given ration cards and you will be given
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:18.680]  so many credits for being a good boy or a good girl and you might buy down that
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:21.960]  new iPod or whatever happens to be that's right that's the secret they get
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:27.040]  you roped in to the casino they get you roped into Wall Street they get you
[03:04:27.040 --> 03:04:31.920]  roped into the pension roped into Social Security roped into the system on your
[03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:36.120]  smaller and smaller island like Howard Beale says just leave us alone in our
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:40.240]  living rooms let me have my toaster and my steel Belgian radials and I'll leave

[03:08:38.360 --> 03:08:43.840]  today Alan Watt author researcher is our guest come to the matrix commas his
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:47.840]  website our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and we were
[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:53.160]  discussing before the break the mind control the way that they have her older
[03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:57.120]  Rivera with the Marine Corps Colonel admitting that our forces help grow the
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:02.600]  opium and CIA aircraft are constantly caught with cocaine and heroin on board
[03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:05.680]  and it's an open secret and came out congressional hearings the government
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:10.280]  ships the drugs in but now they just come out admit they're growing it and
[03:09:10.280 --> 03:09:14.720]  they come out admit the CIA is putting out fake bin Laden videos and they use
[03:09:14.720 --> 03:09:19.640]  the exact same replay of propaganda about Iran having nukes just like Iraq
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:24.880]  supposedly did and it comes out that Rahm Emanuel in mainstream it you know
[03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:30.520]  NBC was getting kickbacks with Blagojevich and that BP was paying
[03:09:30.520 --> 03:09:36.040]  illegally for his apartment and no one gets in trouble and it's just setting
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:41.760]  the precedent that yes it's just like a pimp breaks a prostitute he gets her he
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:45.160]  beats her up and they have that HBO special about pimps and they say what
[03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:49.800]  do you pay your horse I pay her nothing and she likes it maybe I give her some
[03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:55.240]  fried chicken every once in a while and there was a case we talked about in that
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:09:59.440]  same documentary where the prostitute's been hit by a car she's almost dead and
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:03.320]  her mother's there going oh my baby my baby and the pimp comes in all
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:07.840]  arrogantly and she says oh baby I'm gonna get back up for you I'm gonna get back
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:12.040]  off the out of this out of this bed I'm gonna make you that money baby I'm gonna
[03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:16.440]  do everything I can for you and he's like that's right you better and then
[03:10:16.440 --> 03:10:20.720]  the woman just grovels and I don't know what it is about the psyche but but many
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:25.840]  women you know they like the bad guy in high school I didn't know to a certain
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:31.840]  extent I was seen as the bad guy but the point is is that is that inch but I mean
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:37.560]  really the bad guy and and there's an expanded significance to that today
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:41.520]  where there's just a yeah we took trillions Congress the Federal Reserve
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:44.840]  says we're not gonna tell you where it is and it comes out in the Chicago
[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:47.720]  Tribune that Dinecore and Halliburton have been caught running giant child
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:52.320]  kidnapping rings and nobody gets in trouble and it comes out that all of
[03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:58.360]  this is happening and and it's incredible what do you call that scenario
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:11:03.360]  that I call the pimp game I mean how would you quantify that in Alan Watt
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:11.200]  terminology Alan it's part of getting the public used to a form of lawlessness
[03:11:11.200 --> 03:11:16.420]  across the board in society it's easier to control a society in a
[03:11:16.420 --> 03:11:21.200]  feudalistic fashion when the big boys come in with that the black goons the
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:25.840]  black fat goons and soldiers it's easier to control them when they're
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:30.200]  already living in a apparently a corrupt society where you pay off for
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:34.080]  everything and anything that you actually need even to basically survive
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:38.600]  day-to-day in other words there's no law and order at the bottom level
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:42.800]  technically and society itself becomes corrupted they have to become corrupted
[03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:47.200]  to survive and as corrupt globalists their carbon taxes that they admit will
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:50.800]  be on families won't be allowed to live in a home by themselves everything will
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:55.560]  be dormitories there'll be a one-child policy they're now announcing it if you
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:59.960]  can have a factory a business a job everything is up to government and then
[03:11:59.960 --> 03:12:04.400]  it can selectively enforce it and then it's the new superclass where hey honey
[03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:08.000]  you want to be able to have a job you want to be able to have a hamburger
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.440]  stand you look pretty good you've got to serve my troops this is what bondage
[03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:19.040]  means it does and also as I say they need this golf tragedy to bring in the
[03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:22.320]  carbon taxes they've already been trading them as I say for four or five
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:27.880]  years in the EU the European Parliament gave out millions of dollars or euros
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:32.760]  worth of three carbon credits for them to trade they're already making profits
[03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:39.200]  off them or growth childs with our gore as his bank in Switzerland has been
[03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:43.120]  agreed that's where all the carbon taxes for the entire world has to go through
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:46.000]  they're not going to back off you understand I've set this up for the
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:50.240]  last few years and everything counts on it so they need to and they will make
[03:12:50.240 --> 03:12:54.960]  whatever it takes to happen to get it ran through until we're living in utter
[03:12:54.960 --> 03:13:00.960]  poverty and paying all it's also a substitute to for consumerism you'll
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:04.800]  find that everything that you earn will be getting paid back and fees and taxes
[03:13:04.800 --> 03:13:09.520]  and to be very little left to to live on at the bottom and that's a substitute
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:16.680]  for a consumerist society that that's definitely part of their agenda and they
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:21.960]  admit that that's their agenda is to bankrupt everyone but the good news is
[03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:26.080]  as you said their carbon taxes in trouble their wars are in trouble their
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:30.360]  agenda on every front is in trouble and that's why the FCC in the US has now
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:36.680]  announced the Australian style plan a black box in the home that both spies on
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:41.320]  you and regulates what you can watch I didn't even expect for them to come out
[03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:48.200]  this bold this early and actually have it newspapers in the US almost as an
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:50.960]  aside of yeah we're going to track everything you're doing and yeah
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:55.000]  Google's driving around for the NSA listening to everything you do
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.680]  illegally and now that's just the way it is and yeah we're going to start
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:03.320]  shutting down freedom of speech in America and yeah we're gonna bring the
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:07.800]  fairness doctrine back to talk radio they are really desperate this shows
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:11.160]  because from what I've studied they believe we wouldn't wake up this much
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:14.880]  they believe they could use the web that we don't care about LeBron James and
[03:14:14.880 --> 03:14:19.200]  football and basketball and that and Tiger Woods and we wouldn't use the web
[03:14:19.200 --> 03:14:23.400]  as a tool against them now they see that we have used it and as Jay Rockefeller
[03:14:23.400 --> 03:14:26.680]  said in a sit-in hearing we would have been better never inventing the
[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:30.720]  internet so they've clearly made the decision to start shutting it off and
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:35.920]  it appears they're going with a bold you know quick way to do it I don't see that
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:41.640]  going well for them Alan it depends it hangs really on the US see most
[03:14:41.640 --> 03:14:46.680]  countries have gone through generations of financial depression like like
[03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:51.640]  Britain for instance also they've been overrun by immigrants by design Tony
[03:14:51.640 --> 03:14:55.600]  Blair's aid admitted that in the newspapers that Tony Blair said that
[03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:59.880]  he was when they opened the gates of immigration so wide in Britain with the
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:04.440]  most diverse cultures that any semblance of a British identity would be lost
[03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:08.640]  and could never be regained forever that has happened there so people are
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:12.320]  apathetic many of the immigrants came from countries where there is no
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:17.000]  democracy as such and they accept a new totalitarian regime where you do what
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:20.440]  you're told quite naturally that's what they're trying to do in the States as
[03:15:20.440 --> 03:15:24.320]  well right now so it depends on how many people within the United States still
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:29.480]  has enough gumption to stand up and literally by any in all means say no
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:34.720]  we're not going to be your servants in your and your search and and do
[03:15:34.720 --> 03:15:39.160]  something about it is coming down to that if it doesn't happen then you will
[03:15:39.160 --> 03:15:44.040]  go into an even more apathetic state as everyone scrapes to get by to live and
[03:15:44.040 --> 03:15:48.520]  survive and people become more afraid to even speak about anything that's
[03:15:48.520 --> 03:15:53.320]  happening well here's an example of that the New York Daily News is reporting
[03:15:53.320 --> 03:15:57.760]  what sheriffs have told us for five years Mexican drug cartels threatened
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:02.320]  to harm US police officers who bust drug shipments while off duty they're
[03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:07.720]  already killing cops all over and so we knew five years ago from our sources in
[03:16:07.720 --> 03:16:11.440]  the DEA and others that they were training Los Zetas to start killing
[03:16:11.440 --> 03:16:16.040]  American cops and that the New World Order was going to use Mexican muscle to
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:21.160]  start running mafia tactics and because there's the language barrier the average
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:25.600]  American would allow this to creep up on them and now this has been done and
[03:16:25.600 --> 03:16:30.200]  here it is in the New York Daily News I mean we are really going under a total
[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:36.400]  mafia government yeah and it is a style like that you also have a terrible
[03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:39.960]  problem too as a society gets more and more degraded and they lose their
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:46.720]  morality they lose their their ability to offer a common a common idea of the
[03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:50.520]  rights and wrongs within that society you have a massive problem with with cops
[03:16:50.520 --> 03:16:56.160]  on the take in all the big cities but if you won't take the take they threaten
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:01.160]  to kill your family I mean and and and the feds are covering this up and and
[03:17:01.160 --> 03:17:08.360]  and and funded this the CIA is running this this is the death of America it is
[03:17:08.360 --> 03:17:13.960]  actually it is and as I say that the US is the only country left in fact it's
[03:17:13.960 --> 03:17:19.160]  only country that had an idea of personal freedoms and liberties and so on
[03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:23.720]  no other countries had that so it all hinges on what happens within America
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:28.880]  if they succumb to it quietly then it's all over if they make a real ruckus
[03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:37.040]  about it and become very adamant and staunch and firm and movable and that
[03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:41.400]  their demands then they may be listened to and even then the big boys at the top
[03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:46.880]  who are not stupid whatsoever or trying to find ways around it it really is
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:51.680]  that serious Alex within the next five years you won't recognize that it's a
[03:17:51.680 --> 03:17:55.120]  society at all if it goes any further because they've they've laid out their
[03:17:55.120 --> 03:18:01.120]  agenda to the totalitarian system that's planned here a new serfdom a ration
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:05.440]  cards eventually will be introduced they've announced that under the carbon
[03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:08.760]  tax no matter how much money you've got you're gonna have to have the ration
[03:18:08.760 --> 03:18:12.280]  cards and then the black market controlled by the government I mean it is
[03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:18.400]  just racket on top of racket on top of racket with the set goal of bankrupting
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:23.480]  everyone and then they just feed us the culture killing sludge that's on TV to
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:28.640]  turn us all into monkeys yes and also to and this rationing is coming along they
[03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:32.040]  already have a problem with this for the wealthy elite themselves and those who
[03:18:32.040 --> 03:18:38.520]  get into politics you get access to the true natural food and organically grown
[03:18:38.520 --> 03:18:42.600]  food that it doesn't even come in contact with the the sprayed skies the
[03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:47.400]  chemtrails they get access to this and so the goody two shows the ones will get
[03:18:47.400 --> 03:18:52.240]  access to the better rationing the rest of us will die off with the Monsanto GMO
[03:18:52.240 --> 03:18:56.960]  and heavily toxically sprayed stuff so that's part of the agenda is to take down
[03:18:56.960 --> 03:19:03.360]  society and the numbers within our societies and then meanwhile every day
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:10.160]  new major government industry university medical center reports every GMO food
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:15.560]  has the side effect no that's the main effect of sterilizing hurting the rats
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:19.400]  within three generations they're totally sterile hair growing out of their
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:26.400]  mouths deformed we see fetal birth weights way down fetal birth rates are
[03:19:26.400 --> 03:19:33.120]  way up in the United States the honey bees are dying from it it's working like
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:38.320]  a charm I mean this is the most psychopathic nightmare system and the
[03:19:38.320 --> 03:19:43.640]  public's defenseless because all they care about is football baseball Hollywood
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:49.440]  gossip and drinking their sodium fluoride and those of us that are awake
[03:19:49.440 --> 03:19:54.120]  are being listed as terrorists and the borders are imploding I mean it is just
[03:19:54.120 --> 03:19:57.200]  and now they're ready for world war three your phone calls coming up next

[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:13.240]  once was a land where the people were very very free energy was cheap and
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:19.400]  prosperity filled the land this made some grown-ups very angry and they wanted to
[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:25.400]  take away our freedoms so they created a mythical crisis saying CO2 was bad
[03:24:25.400 --> 03:24:32.000]  even though CO2 is what we breathe and it makes the plants grow in fact nothing
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:37.120]  would be green without CO2 and they scared all the children by saying that
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:41.760]  people doing ordinary things were killing the planet so they passed a very
[03:24:41.760 --> 03:24:47.560]  nasty bill called cap and trade so they could tax us for everything we do like
[03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:53.480]  keeping our houses warm and driving cars and that's why we can't afford to keep
[03:24:53.480 --> 03:25:05.080]  the house any warmer honey to stop global warming honey but they really did it
[03:25:05.080 --> 03:25:08.080]  because they want to kill that little girl they don't want her to be born in
[03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:12.680]  their own words this is eugenics this is about the globalist controlling
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:16.880]  society some folks took a government paid for high-budget ad that says that
[03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:23.000]  bunny rabbits and dogs will drown and die that they air in Australia and they
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:29.480]  made a spoof of what it really means Allen what again you understand that
[03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:32.920]  this is an incremental scientific dictatorship in their own words but a
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:35.960]  lot of times you're a bit pessimistic speaking of solutions before we go to
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:40.120]  calls I do see us having a fighting chance I mean I really am seeing a
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:44.160]  massive awakening happening right now and I think that's why the bigger
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:48.320]  brazinski as you know about five weeks ago gave a speech to the CFR in Canada
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:52.040]  where you live and basically said for the first time in history the whole world
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:55.960]  is awake to us and our world governments in trouble and that's what
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:59.600]  their internal documents show I mean I don't think they're invincible what do
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:05.040]  you think they're not invincible is the will of the people that this is take
[03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:09.680]  care and the problem is and this is what I've discussed at the top that
[03:26:09.680 --> 03:26:14.520]  themselves and own books they work out everything under a warfare strategy and
[03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:18.200]  they've said that if those who are still making enough money to get by and so on
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:22.960]  if they aren't making enough money they will not join the rest of the bottom so
[03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:28.120]  they're hoping to re-segregate society from the haves and have nots as they
[03:26:28.120 --> 03:26:33.160]  push it further and further and bring up taxes and extra taxes and even value-added
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:37.200]  taxes but written by the ways just put up their value-added tax to 20% on
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:41.840]  every purchase so they're hoping to do the same thing in America so those who
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:47.440]  can it can keep affording it until it hurts them they'll tend to neglect
[03:26:47.440 --> 03:26:51.280]  those beneath them who are really arching and then the poor will become
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:54.920]  more vicious and start attacking the middle class so the middle class will
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:26:59.040]  instinctively then kind of team up with the elite at least in their own minds
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:02.480]  when it's the elite that or is rid of the entire program to begin with that's
[03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:06.400]  right and what has to happen is therefore is that everyone has to have a
[03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:10.840]  quick education that it doesn't matter what class you think you belong to and
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:15.320]  how well you think that you're doing it at the moment they're going to take the
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:19.480]  whole system down gradually until you're all serves and they get it wrong to
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:23.480]  everybody in the end because there's to be no middle class what so ever left
[03:27:23.480 --> 03:27:27.320]  after this agenda is through they've said then all the writings from Karl
[03:27:27.320 --> 03:27:30.680]  Marx right up through the Royal issue of international affairs no middle class
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:35.160]  will be allowed this new scientific society the only a replacement for a
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:39.440]  middle class will be a scientific elite and that's what we have already look
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:43.520]  who who've abomas appointed and all these different panels there's a more
[03:27:43.520 --> 03:27:47.640]  appointees than any previous government and these guys are all the old
[03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:52.120]  hardline scientific socialist type communists that have been helping to
[03:27:52.120 --> 03:27:55.920]  write the depopulation programs for years there's never been an
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:00.120]  administration this pact I mean they're all saying no second amendment global
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:04.880]  extermination one-child policies eugenics no free speech I mean they're in a
[03:28:04.880 --> 03:28:11.840]  group of authoritarian goblin like potbelly jowled little human hating
[03:28:11.840 --> 03:28:17.200]  trash mm-hmm and also what the US and everybody else has to do is to kick off
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:22.080]  all these people all these appointees all these NGO groups that are now
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:26.360]  appointed to governments we did not elect them they have no say over our
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:30.920]  lives and therefore they have to be kicked out completely and government has
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:36.160]  to be taught and you know this Alex government only one way or another one
[03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:41.080]  way or another government has to be taught retaught that they serve the
[03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:47.160]  people well notice it's not public servant it's official it's authority in
[03:28:47.160 --> 03:28:52.240]  the media creamily calls them officials and mm-hmm bows down to them and gets
[03:28:52.240 --> 03:28:57.240]  the government press releases and with relish repeats the lies and bows to
[03:28:57.240 --> 03:29:01.320]  government everything's the opposite of what liberty is just bowing and
[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:06.840]  groveling to the petty signants of power that's right this is a strange
[03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:12.960]  society where the public servants earn more than maybe a thousand
[03:29:12.960 --> 03:29:17.600]  families combined each so that there's something wrong here and if you get back
[03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:22.160]  to serving the people they've never served the people in other countries in
[03:29:22.160 --> 03:29:26.520]  the US you were the only country with that with a chance and I think people
[03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:30.080]  have to regain that very very quickly and as I say by one means or another
[03:29:30.080 --> 03:29:33.640]  because we know the agenda they've told us the agenda they know what's in store
[03:29:33.640 --> 03:29:37.320]  they're already pose poisoning the food the water most of us are dead already

[03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:16.560]  allen one I don't know here in just a minute by the way everything we're
[03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:20.400]  talking about is in hundreds of government textbooks policy reports
[03:33:20.400 --> 03:33:24.600]  that's the frustration is the globalists said a hundred years ago they were
[03:33:24.600 --> 03:33:29.520]  gonna build a global socialist system to bankrupt everyone and make us all
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:33.600]  dependent on a scientific elite to then carry out the eugenics extermination
[03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:37.280]  of the general public and that's what they're gonna do and they're already
[03:33:37.280 --> 03:33:40.400]  poisoning you in the food and water some people send me emails and say we live
[03:33:40.400 --> 03:33:46.000]  longer than we did a hundred years ago depending on the period around 30%
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:52.600]  sometimes even higher 50% right in between those gradients people died by
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:56.480]  the age of five to six to seven a lot of kids died at you know the first six
[03:33:56.480 --> 03:34:02.040]  months you had a lot of infant mortality so they average that in and say oh the
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:07.680]  average person lived to be say 43 years old in 1860 well that's not true if you
[03:34:07.680 --> 03:34:13.040]  made it past the age of 10 the average person lived into their early 80s and if
[03:34:13.040 --> 03:34:16.760]  you look at infant mortality they now admit that america has the lowest infant
[03:34:16.760 --> 03:34:21.160]  mortality that is the highest rate of children dying the highest infant
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:27.800]  mortality in the world oven of any industrialized world a country and I'm
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:30.280]  trying to hurry here and I start babbling whenever I do that because I've
[03:34:30.280 --> 03:34:33.880]  got Alan Watt in your calls but let me just take my time on this for a moment
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:38.680]  there's different statistics from each year gleaned in different counties and
[03:34:38.680 --> 03:34:43.800]  cities and they've gone back and looked at this but here's a layman's way of
[03:34:43.800 --> 03:34:48.920]  explaining it we have family cemeteries in each taxes that we visited and you
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:51.840]  will see jones johnson's browns depending on what cemetery we're
[03:34:51.840 --> 03:35:00.360]  visiting and 30% or more you know every two or three graves it's a year old
[03:35:00.360 --> 03:35:08.440]  child two-year-old child one month old child child stillbirth a lot of the
[03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:16.680]  graves are children so when you look at that then you look at Russia their life
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:20.160]  expectancy is going way down the United States is going way down we are being
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:23.520]  poisoned we are being killed this is happening so I'm done talking about that
[03:35:23.520 --> 03:35:25.960]  I'm gonna tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio

[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:36.280]  Dan you're on the air thanks for holding. Hi Alex I'm a long-time listener first
[03:38:36.280 --> 03:38:39.720]  time caller I've been listening to you for about seven years hope they'll give
[03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:43.760]  me a minute here to go ahead and try to correct her wrong I believe you're a
[03:38:43.760 --> 03:38:48.000]  phenomenal person that has a great amount of knowledge but one of the one
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:51.440]  thing you said today that has bothered me so bad it was worth waiting the hour and
[03:38:51.440 --> 03:38:54.960]  20 minutes to be able to say something this business about the Catholic
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:39:00.500]  clergy not aligned men to be married for most men having sex with men is bull is
[03:39:00.500 --> 03:39:05.360]  the reality of it isn't there from associate oppressed their insurers
[03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:10.880]  report indicates more child sex beautiful most Protestant and clergy. Yes sir I
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:14.760]  mean let me be clear I'm not involved in Catholic bashing here and I get
[03:39:14.760 --> 03:39:18.160]  criticized because I don't Catholic bash it's very popular thing to do in the
[03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:23.400]  media promotes it I know there's been debates in the Catholic Church and just
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:28.280]  from my study of different navies and and you know other groups I mean it
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:30.720]  seems to me you get a bunch of men together and they can never be with a
[03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:34.760]  woman that you're statistically gonna have some problems there but you know I
[03:39:34.760 --> 03:39:38.760]  was taking calls I'm saying you've been holding before Alan White but people just
[03:39:38.760 --> 03:39:42.440]  obsess over this stuff the lady called in and says a bit about the Catholic
[03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:46.840]  Church so I just threw in there that there is epidemic levels of child
[03:39:46.840 --> 03:39:51.200]  molestation going on all over the place we talk about Congress and these
[03:39:51.200 --> 03:39:55.680]  congressmen and how in powerful positions this is going on everywhere and
[03:39:55.680 --> 03:40:00.640]  I don't think that can be denied Dan. Alex are you gonna allow me to speak? Well I mean
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:04.360]  you're on the air sir I just responded you had a chance here hold on I'll put
[03:40:04.360 --> 03:40:07.880]  him on hold you just allowed me I mean I mean I allowed you to make your
[03:40:07.880 --> 03:40:12.120]  statement which was a whole thought and then I countered and it seemed it made
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:18.160]  you really mad that that that I came back with my point about how child
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:23.080]  molestation is epidemic in power systems and I'm gonna go down and watch take on
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:26.600]  that in a moment but but go ahead Dan or you can respect me enough to go ahead
[03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:29.880]  and want me to purchase your products no no put him on hold put him on hold he's
[03:40:29.880 --> 03:40:34.960]  mad see and he's gonna pick a fight with me because he doesn't like what I said
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:40.000]  earlier about how there's I mean obviously that the pope I mean if he's
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:45.680]  infallible he said that he said he said that it was wrong and he apologized I
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:50.800]  mean I'm not obsessing over this but but I mean we don't really even get into
[03:40:50.800 --> 03:40:54.040]  these issues because it's already well known but you're angry Dan if you want
[03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:57.920]  to put out your opinion or set me straight go ahead but if you're so
[03:40:57.920 --> 03:41:02.080]  enraged because I'm giving my opinion then there's no point Dan now well let's
[03:41:02.080 --> 03:41:05.960]  try one more time go ahead Dan I'm in a rage because you're talking over me
[03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:10.640]  that's why I'm in a rage interrupt okay hold again we're gonna continue this
[03:41:10.640 --> 03:41:15.360]  we're gonna continue this Dan this is how this is how this works see I don't
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:18.800]  sit there like these old foggy radio shows that nobody listens to or one guy
[03:41:18.800 --> 03:41:22.200]  talks for an hour and nobody interjects people like hearing back and forth
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:27.120]  that's normal unless you've got you know Alzheimer's what I'm saying to you sir
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:35.400]  is that you made your counterpoint to me and then I made my counterpoint back and
[03:41:35.400 --> 03:41:38.240]  you're calling that an eruption I'm gonna give you one more chance to not
[03:41:38.240 --> 03:41:43.640]  repeat that I'm interrupting and tell me your view my view is you got it all
[03:41:43.640 --> 03:41:47.720]  wrong if you don't know who Bella dotted your real school of darkness a Catholic
[03:41:47.720 --> 03:41:52.400]  Communist agent the way and infiltrated a Catholic Church with over 1000 men also
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:56.200]  testified in front of Congress put back in the 30s and the 40s if you don't know
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:41:59.160]  about that you don't know what's going on as far as the battle within the Catholic
[03:41:59.160 --> 03:42:03.120]  Church there's good and evil here sir I'm not a Catholic so I mean I don't know a
[03:42:03.120 --> 03:42:06.640]  lot about the I mean about it I've got Catholic friends they seem like good
[03:42:06.640 --> 03:42:09.960]  people that are out there you know standing up against abortion and things
[03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:13.740]  Catholics are some of the best people I've met my my whole thing is I'm non
[03:42:13.740 --> 03:42:18.360]  partisan I'm non-denominational I don't weigh into all these religious infighting
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:23.520]  that's a tool of the globalist and I do know that they that the Communists and
[03:42:23.520 --> 03:42:27.000]  others said they would infiltrate all of the clergy to take them over and
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:31.200]  corrupt them and I and I am aware of that and actually we have talked about
[03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:38.280]  that here on the show so listen Dan why don't you write an article and send it
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:42.560]  to info wars.com with your points and if it's well written and sourced we'll
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:47.520]  post it we have people that give us different views write an op-ed piece
[03:42:47.520 --> 03:42:52.720]  send it to writers and info wars.com okay I appreciate your call I'm sorry Alan
[03:42:52.720 --> 03:42:57.560]  to digress for three minutes on that but I mean I just the guy's really wound
[03:42:57.560 --> 03:43:02.920]  up do you have any comments to that it's divide and conquer is quite right that
[03:43:02.920 --> 03:43:08.720]  the Catholic Church was heavily infiltrated Malachi Martin came out and
[03:43:08.720 --> 03:43:14.880]  said that there was in a hierarchy and going up downwards there was a group of
[03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:19.800]  homosexual priests there who covered for each other and were up to many other
[03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:24.240]  things which were definitely not Catholic whatsoever it's a bureaucracy at the top
[03:43:24.240 --> 03:43:29.120]  and infiltrated in its own direction and since Vatican I and Vatican II
[03:43:29.120 --> 03:43:33.480]  technically they've helped to destroy what was left to the church we can
[03:43:33.480 --> 03:43:36.960]  understand that everything that was an institution that gave values to people
[03:43:36.960 --> 03:43:41.520]  has been destroyed over the last hundred years and what was left even of the
[03:43:41.520 --> 03:43:46.960]  Protestant religions I can't even relate to them anymore because they're
[03:43:46.960 --> 03:43:52.200]  they're almost like TV evangelists that with feel good attitudes and never look
[03:43:52.200 --> 03:43:57.400]  at evil just be happy everything has been destroyed along with the morality
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:02.520]  that goes with it and society has been debased to its bottom level the
[03:44:02.520 --> 03:44:06.880]  deviancy in society is rampant through all society now look at what they're
[03:44:06.880 --> 03:44:11.200]  watching on television and I don't watch TV but if I tune in once every six
[03:44:11.200 --> 03:44:15.880]  months to a year I feel like I've come back from an alien planet and how far
[03:44:15.880 --> 03:44:19.360]  it's gone that's right because they incrementally make it wilder and more
[03:44:19.360 --> 03:44:23.560]  sick and more mentally ill and just nonsensical the cartoons are meant to
[03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:27.560]  screw the kids up and confuse them so they'll be rudderless and if you don't
[03:44:27.560 --> 03:44:32.440]  watch a lot of TV then when you come back to it it is just laced with propaganda
[03:44:32.440 --> 03:44:37.080]  no matter what you're watching I challenge people you know stop drinking
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:41.960]  tap water and then six months later taste how horrible it tastes I challenge
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:46.480]  people to not watch TV for six months and then go back to it and and you will
[03:44:46.480 --> 03:44:51.480]  witness the program and go ahead Alan well even in much music television for
[03:44:51.480 --> 03:44:56.040]  the youngsters is simulated sex I mean it's almost they're almost naked now
[03:44:56.040 --> 03:45:00.640]  as well as taking the rest of the rags off whatever they're wearing because
[03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:05.120]  that's what you're seeing on television that's the message to the young that
[03:45:05.120 --> 03:45:08.640]  anything goes remember too they said that they're going to make the children
[03:45:08.640 --> 03:45:13.920]  obsessed obsessed with sex even before puberty and when they could do that
[03:45:13.920 --> 03:45:18.160]  those children would never bond with a mate for life it would not happen
[03:45:18.160 --> 03:45:23.560]  multiple sex Julian Huxley the first CEO of UNESCO said that very thing he said
[03:45:23.560 --> 03:45:28.240]  we shall push this till there comes an addiction and he said they will not bond
[03:45:28.240 --> 03:45:31.800]  and get married therefore they can copulate as much as they want as long
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:36.120]  as there's no offspring that's what we want that's happened that's already gone
[03:45:36.120 --> 03:45:39.640]  and passed and they all write books about it they all stated over and over
[03:45:39.640 --> 03:45:45.040]  again and again I didn't want to digress with Dan it's just to me it's a
[03:45:45.040 --> 03:45:50.040]  complete divide and conquer distraction all I simply said was is that I couldn't
[03:45:50.040 --> 03:45:55.720]  imagine not being married and having kids and and so that was the point I was
[03:45:55.720 --> 03:46:00.240]  throwing out there let's go ahead and talk to Al in Texas Al you're on the
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:04.760]  year go ahead good afternoon Alex it's a pleasure to be with you God bless you
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:09.120]  I know it's got to be stressful you know your your job and I can't even imagine
[03:46:09.120 --> 03:46:13.000]  the stress level that you're in man well we do what we got to do but thank you
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:17.560]  sir any questions for Ellen water statements well statements really I'd
[03:46:17.560 --> 03:46:22.200]  like to let the people of Southeast Texas know that we have got to use our
[03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:26.440]  own printers and ink to print up the Constitution the Bill of Rights we have
[03:46:26.440 --> 03:46:31.600]  got to get it out to as many people as possible these documents themselves are
[03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:36.760]  really the most important things we have and if people don't read them if
[03:46:36.760 --> 03:46:41.040]  people don't understand them then they're they have them themselves to blame
[03:46:41.040 --> 03:46:46.520]  for for what happens you know in the in the coming years we are presently trying
[03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:51.840]  to organize a walk along the Mississippi River well not along the river
[03:46:51.840 --> 03:46:55.800]  literally but we're trying to get a bunch of copies of the Constitution the
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:00.640]  Bill of Rights to to give you know hand out to people and you know show them
[03:47:00.640 --> 03:47:04.720]  you know the true documents and and let them know what's really going on you
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:09.440]  know you know that just they need to understand that these documents are law
[03:47:09.440 --> 03:47:14.560]  this is what our nation is supposed to abide by and that's why we put free ones
[03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:17.960]  in with all the orders at info wars dot com now I appreciate your call
[03:47:17.960 --> 03:47:21.960]  Aaron in Texas you're on the air does anybody have a question for Ellen want
[03:47:21.960 --> 03:47:27.080]  yeah I was actually one that touched on the subject earlier about the mind
[03:47:27.080 --> 03:47:34.240]  control and about you know I've been noticing a lot on the television with
[03:47:34.240 --> 03:47:40.440]  connect a million minds I know Time Warner is the the one who's putting it
[03:47:40.440 --> 03:47:46.360]  on the air but I don't know if you've seen that commercial at all no what is
[03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:51.280]  it I don't watch very much TV what is it it's an after-school care for children
[03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:56.520]  oh kids shows are just a hundred percent brainwashing yeah yeah it's it's a
[03:47:56.520 --> 03:48:02.800]  program that you put your children in I've just seen it popping up recently
[03:48:02.800 --> 03:48:10.120]  it basically just how it talks about about science and technology and and
[03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:16.080]  how to how to progress your children's life basically I've seen PBS shows
[03:48:16.080 --> 03:48:19.560]  everyone I've tuned in with kids about how great it is to take vaccine shots
[03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:23.960]  Alan want talking about children's programming that's really bizarre when
[03:48:23.960 --> 03:48:28.840]  you watch it it is that bizarre but it was always been that way really since
[03:48:28.840 --> 03:48:34.960]  the 60s onwards now you'll realize that the strip writers are paid by
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:39.280]  governments to write cartoons with messages in it to do with environment
[03:48:39.280 --> 03:48:43.640]  and many many other topics preparing them for the life that they will grow up
[03:48:43.640 --> 03:48:47.800]  into which will be entirely different from their parents so they're being
[03:48:47.800 --> 03:48:52.160]  programmed that everything that the tables experience in their life is normal
[03:48:52.160 --> 03:48:56.160]  and when it comes along they're pre-programmed for from kindergarten
[03:48:56.160 --> 03:49:02.760]  up with the cartoons it's amazing you know almost every author in Canada the
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:07.160]  rights novels is less on a grant from the government because we're socialists
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:11.720]  here you see same in Britain and they must write in all the political correct
[03:49:11.720 --> 03:49:16.000]  updates and messages for that's what my dad pointed out he said he's always seen
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:20.840]  propaganda in science fiction and novels but he says now almost every book he
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:25.200]  buys randomly that's a bill bestseller is about how patriots are bad and gun
[03:49:25.200 --> 03:49:29.600]  owners are bad and drugging people is good world government is good I mean
[03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:33.920]  we're just swimming and brainwashing which is the prima facie evidence of a
[03:49:33.920 --> 03:49:40.440]  tyranny it's tyranny but it is to be a scientifically elitist driven society
[03:49:40.440 --> 03:49:46.080]  they say that we're post-democratic now the democracy is too cumbersome it's
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:50.920]  too many conflicting parties therefore it's out the window regardless of the
[03:49:50.920 --> 03:49:56.800]  semblance they still give you for party opposition it's really just an act we're
[03:49:56.800 --> 03:50:00.160]  post-democratic they're all on board with it it's just just an act for the
[03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:03.640]  public that's all they are that's all politics is now well said Alan let's
[03:50:03.640 --> 03:50:08.040]  jam in let's jam in one more herring towards the end Monica in California

[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:29.560]  completely collapsing
[03:54:29.560 --> 03:54:34.320]  and uh... border state sheriffs begging for help they're under siege

[03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:56.040]  uh... anything else on your mind
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:55:01.560]  uh... yes i was watching tv the other day in something kind of alarming uh...
[03:55:01.560 --> 03:55:03.680]  doctor on it
[03:55:03.680 --> 03:55:06.320]  program at saying how you can protect
[03:55:06.320 --> 03:55:08.800]  your family from anthrax
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:12.960]  and i'm just i want to tell the american people that you know we have a little
[03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:14.000]  time
[03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:19.120]  and it's not fun to fight hearing that's right but i think anthrax attacks
[03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:22.240]  months before it even happened and that's why on nine eleven i said they're
[03:55:22.240 --> 03:55:23.880]  going to launch an anthrax attack
[03:55:23.880 --> 03:55:26.880]  and three weeks later we found out they'd already launched it they pre
[03:55:26.880 --> 03:55:28.720]  program and when you know
[03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:32.280]  it's incredibly obvious is that what you're getting at monica
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:37.720]  yes and they're also pushing for adults to get this new dp t-shirt
[03:55:37.720 --> 03:55:41.560]  so that's something that should be alarmed to the american people and
[03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:45.600]  look it's not fun to fight hearing that we need to get up off offer but stop
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:50.200]  depending on ron paul and alex jones because you guys do a great job
[03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:53.960]  and you guys give a lot of your family time up to do what you do
[03:55:53.960 --> 03:55:57.200]  and it's greatly appreciated well we appreciate you but i'm not going to have
[03:55:57.200 --> 03:55:58.240]  a family
[03:55:58.240 --> 03:56:00.740]  at a future i'm not going to be able to have grandchildren
[03:56:00.740 --> 03:56:03.520]  if we don't turn this around now i mean i don't think people understand that i
[03:56:03.520 --> 03:56:05.680]  use the parallel of the
[03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:09.040]  you know the analogy of the those old movies where you're trapped in the
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:12.440]  chamber and the waters pouring in and if you don't figure out the combination
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:14.760]  you're going to uh... you know drowned
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:17.200]  very very quickly alan uh...
[03:56:17.200 --> 03:56:18.640]  any other key points
[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:19.920]  you want to make
[03:56:19.920 --> 03:56:22.880]  yeah i'm at this uh... g eight to g twenty
[03:56:22.880 --> 03:56:24.240]  are going on now
[03:56:24.240 --> 03:56:25.760]  in toronto
[03:56:25.760 --> 03:56:29.880]  uh... at the top of the list of course is the golf uh... mess and out of it
[03:56:29.880 --> 03:56:33.240]  will come the debate to do with the carbon taxes
[03:56:33.240 --> 03:56:35.000]  energy conservation
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:39.040]  uh... we've already got smart meters but across carada uh... like crazy just
[03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:40.400]  throwing them in there
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:44.680]  these things have uh... to communicate directly to the electric uh...
[03:56:44.680 --> 03:56:47.320]  masters group or whatever to happen to be
[03:56:47.320 --> 03:56:50.320]  by two methods broadband and f m
[03:56:50.320 --> 03:56:52.840]  and the purpose according to them in britain
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:56.400]  is that they can then cut you off anytime they wish to when you exceed
[03:56:56.400 --> 03:56:58.200]  your allocated quarter
[03:56:58.200 --> 03:57:00.360]  all that's already being done in california
[03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:04.720]  and now the license plates are gonna flash government homeland security
[03:57:04.720 --> 03:57:08.080]  messages in brainwashing all the license plates
[03:57:08.080 --> 03:57:11.800]  uh... nationwide is starting in california will be little telescreen
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:15.040]  brainwashing messages alan what have you seen that article
[03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:18.480]  i haven't seen that one now that's interesting in california license
[03:57:18.480 --> 03:57:20.720]  plates may go digital
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:24.920]  and it says image ad blaring license plates that goes on amber alerts and
[03:57:24.920 --> 03:57:26.320]  government messages
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:29.480]  so now you're a slave advertising government propaganda but going back to
[03:57:29.480 --> 03:57:30.760]  what you said
[03:57:30.760 --> 03:57:34.480]  notice how copenhagen and every other meeting they have they've got to have a
[03:57:34.480 --> 03:57:38.360]  carbon tax for the g twenty and now they'll have this new meeting and claim
[03:57:38.360 --> 03:57:42.600]  they just have this idea for the exact same global carbon tax treaty which will
[03:57:42.600 --> 03:57:45.160]  find the private central banks
[03:57:45.160 --> 03:57:49.040]  they've never changed their tactics and their agenda when they make a plan
[03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:50.440]  does not work comes
[03:57:50.440 --> 03:57:53.960]  they will run it through one way or another but what's interesting too is
[03:57:53.960 --> 03:57:56.840]  that canada and they don't most things don't even know it
[03:57:56.840 --> 03:58:00.960]  they're using canadian taxpayers money to build big giant can do that's canadian
[03:58:00.960 --> 03:58:05.360]  company can do nuclear reactors in china right now
[03:58:05.360 --> 03:58:07.880]  and we're paying for from canada
[03:58:07.880 --> 03:58:12.560]  china under the agreement through gas is still a third-world country believe it or not
[03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:15.360]  we can't even get them to repair our old ones here
[03:58:15.360 --> 03:58:18.680]  that's right you can't have new coal plants there because of carbon taxes but
[03:58:18.680 --> 03:58:21.880]  i saw that in your news but you're paying for nuclear reactors in china to
[03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:26.480]  run factories well said alan won alan will talk to you again soon
