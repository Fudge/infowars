[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.000]  Well, it happened to the media's heart.
[00:36.000 --> 00:45.000]  They're already in overdrive, spinning that it's Trump dissing women and dissing other world leaders to worship Putin.
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.000]  They've now shaken hands and yesterday, of course, the Polish First Lady, Melania, reached out her hand.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  Trump was also reaching out. That's something that happens routinely in diplomatic events.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  She shook the lady's hand first. They said it was a major diss because she was already walking right past.
[01:03.000 --> 01:11.000]  And then the media edits it there to not show you how right after she shakes Melania's hand, she shakes Trump's hand.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  Now again, this seems stupid to cover.
[01:14.000 --> 01:23.000]  But the reason it's important is it shows how deceptive MSM is and it's a window into how they're operating and what they think of you.
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  And how they're targeting you and I and everybody else on this planet.
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's peer pressure. Melania's getting off the plane in Tel Aviv.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  Trump's 10 feet ahead of her. He starts reaching his hand back, looking for her hand.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  She's focused ahead on the people who she's going to shake their hands. She's a model.
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  She has better etiquette than he does, better etiquette than anybody I've seen in a long time, quite frankly. Amazing etiquette.
[01:49.000 --> 01:56.000]  She doesn't get his hand. They say, oh, they're fighting. She hates him. No, she's walking down the runway. She's focused.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  So when he shakes Putin's hand, he's a Russian agent.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  When the Polish president's wife is already about to shake hands with Melania,
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  Trump tries to be gracious and puts his hand out because he's ahead of Melania.
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.000]  Same things happens and the media runs it like it's the number one story in the world.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  But the Polish president's wife, the first lady of Poland, dissed him.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  She came out and said, that's fake news. Melania's hand was out first. I was already going past the president.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  But again, that's how they take the petty and ignore him saying, good job, Poland, not letting an Islamic invasion happen.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  You've had no terrorist attacks. Great job, Poland, working with the West.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  Great job, Poland, becoming so productive and getting your economy going. We want to work with you.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  Instead of the millions of people on the street supporting Trump, they turn it into the polls didn't even want to see Trump.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  The Polish people don't like Trump. In fact, the Polish first lady wouldn't even shake his hand.
[02:54.000 --> 03:02.000]  That's what Hollywood does. That's the mindset they push, that you're not in the cool crowd if you're not for Hillary.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  There's nothing more uncool than the Republican leadership, the Democratic leadership, people like Nancy Pelosi.
[03:09.000 --> 03:20.000]  They are a joke. And the truth is, whether it's India or Israel or Russia or Poland and many other countries,
[03:20.000 --> 03:28.000]  Trump is a rock star because they know he's a maverick. They know he's a rebel. They know he's a nationalist.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  They know he's pro-Christian. They know he's pro-wealth. He's pro-progress.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  He's pro-success, not globalist, combines and crony capitalism and oligopolies and monopolies.
[03:41.000 --> 03:49.000]  But they're so delusional at CNN, they've plummeted to a one-star rating at the Apple Store.
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.000]  We have a 4.5 at the Apple Store out of five.
[03:56.000 --> 04:07.000]  And they have the lowest ratings, not just in cable TV, but they got beaten by reruns, decades-old reruns, of Yogi Bear cartoon.
[04:07.000 --> 04:17.000]  Yes, from the 1970s, you heard me right, arrogant Don Lemon, arrogant Anderson Cooper, arrogant.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  That's all they've got left is their arrogance. Let's go out to break with the president, talking about meeting with Trump.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  It's an honor to be with you. Here it is.
[04:26.000 --> 04:34.000]  We've had some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now, and obviously that will continue.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  But we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening to Russia, to the United States, and to everybody concerned.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  It's an honor to be with you.
[04:45.000 --> 04:59.000]  We're going to come back with more of this, but what happened is, Trump's strong statements gave them cover now to make a deal.
[05:15.000 --> 05:24.000]  There is a collusion story fading into the background, an issue that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings despite knowing it was fake news.
[05:24.000 --> 05:34.000]  The network's ratings are now plummeting, and there's no doubt that CNN's most recent scandal that sparked hashtag CNN blackmail has played a role.
[05:34.000 --> 05:47.000]  CNN threatened to dock some random gift-creator that President Trump happened to retweet. To put things into perspective, the CNN app now has only one star out of five in the Apple App Store,
[05:47.000 --> 05:56.000]  where comparably the Fox News app has three and a half stars, whereas the InfoWars and Alex Jones' radio app have both four and a half stars.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  I'm Milla Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:05.000]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  Talk about next-level probiotic. It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast, latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting list, limited amount, because it's so hard to get the compounds, and they haven't been California standards.
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  Nobody's got something that's good.
[06:18.000 --> 06:25.000]  Save 30% off of MycoZX and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  Probiotic. MycoZX contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and well-crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZX.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  InfoWars.com, before it sells out again, 10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist 50 years ago, now it's epidemic.
[06:48.000 --> 06:51.000]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them,

[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  Star Spangled Banner flutters in the sky.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  Star Spangled Banner flutters in the sky.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  Time hustles those who wait to die.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  That's some deep poetry right there.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  Sweet soul sister.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, kicking off this global Friday worldwide transmission.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, and of course, BackupsidePrisonPlanet.com.
[09:22.000 --> 09:35.000]  You can follow us on Twitter at realalexjones and all our other great reporters and crew like Paul, Joseph Watson, the good old PJW.
[09:35.000 --> 09:42.000]  I've really got to take my time today to go over what's happening.
[09:42.000 --> 09:54.000]  Because we've got really serious news with the head US commander in the Pacific saying that the United States is prepared and is preparing to carry out strikes if ordered on North Korea.
[09:54.000 --> 10:03.000]  And China and Russia have green-lighted that they may back those strikes if North Korea continues to threaten to nuke their neighbors and test ICBMs.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  So that's some huge negative news.
[10:05.000 --> 10:20.000]  And since it's been, what, almost 60 years since the ceasefire armistice, a fancy term for a ceasefire, there on the demilitarized zone, we tend to get a little complacent and think that it's never going to happen.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  But as you know in life, things tend to actually happen if they can happen.
[10:25.000 --> 10:41.000]  So a very, very serious situation with Kim Jong-un, who is running his own country and now not under the thumb of China, who certainly is a villainous, but not megalomaniacal or completely disconnected from reality.
[10:41.000 --> 10:46.000]  They're megalomaniacal in many ways, but not when it comes to destroying their own nest.
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.000]  So we have that situation going on.
[10:50.000 --> 10:58.000]  But we have the economy speeding up in ways, slowing down in others, global combines trying to kill the economy.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  We've got U.S. today, as I said, reporting the severe options for North Korea are on the table.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  We've got reports on infowars.com, looking at the different options that Trump has.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  We're going to be breaking that down some today.
[11:13.000 --> 11:28.000]  And then you've got the incredible arrogance of MSM, the entire mainstream media dying combine, who for 20 years have seen their ratings decline to basically nothing, 100,000 viewers per average show.
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  That's local radio shows in big cities have that easily.
[11:31.000 --> 11:49.000]  So it is a legend in its own mind, the mouse of Lord, but still as trolls, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC and others, they can still troll the public with fake news stories and they can still create racial division.
[11:49.000 --> 11:57.000]  They can still stir up hoaxes. They can still push lies and they can combine forces and try to prop each other up.
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.000]  Now, something very interesting has happened in the last month.
[12:01.000 --> 12:10.000]  We've seen MSM turn on Megan Kelly, something MSM doesn't normally do in its news divisions when it came to the interview with yours truly.
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  Her ratings now are one third of what they were when she started out five weeks ago.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  The public is totally turned on her and her attacks on America and the free press.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  She was sent in on a suicide mission politically.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  The same things happened at CNN.
[12:29.000 --> 12:46.000]  For the first time we're seeing the Washington Post, the New York Times, ABC News all turning on CNN and saying they got clothes lined by bullying the maker of the Trump body slam meme.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  That wears their journalistic standards that Zucker promised a few months ago to put into place.
[12:52.000 --> 12:59.000]  That was the Washington Post. Now, that's hilarious because the only media worse than CNN is the Washington Post.
[12:59.000 --> 13:15.000]  $600 million. The last month in office that Obama gave to the CIA in a section of domestic propaganda that he legalized four years ago to engage in disinformation via the Washington Post.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  It writes the talking points.
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  Media Matters writes talking points to a lesser degree, but they're number two.
[13:21.000 --> 13:25.000]  The Washington Post now writes the hit piece talking points.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  So to have the Washington Post demonizing and saying CNN's done is just fabulous.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  The hypocrisy, the arrogance.
[13:39.000 --> 13:49.000]  The just total delusional behavior believing in their desperateness that if they start throwing each other overboard,
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  if they start throwing each other overboard, that that will somehow let them survive.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  This is final phase meltdown, final phase burning to the ground.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  Because I'll be honest with you, everybody hailed me as some genius playing Megan Kelly like a fiddle and that, oh, I did this incredible job.
[14:08.000 --> 14:16.000]  I didn't do that good of a job and I say this because data is key and I'm not going to give you false data.
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.000]  You hate them so much that they could have run a rotting possum against her in the ratings that she would have failed.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  She's hated and they're hated so much that nothing they do will ever put them back together again.
[14:29.000 --> 14:40.000]  By extension, challenging her, going into the lion's den, knowing they'd edit it, knowing they'd make me look like a gibbering idiot, it didn't matter.
[14:40.000 --> 14:48.000]  Because it became a spectacle to focus on the fact that a fight was happening and I knew it was a fight we'd win because of you.
[14:48.000 --> 15:05.000]  And the arrogant chup tides of the world and the arrogant Chris Comos have not figured it out yet than the arrogant Nancy Pelosi's, the arrogant Maxine Waters, the arrogant Hillary Clinton's on just fruit take level power trips.
[15:05.000 --> 15:26.000]  When you see them out in public, the stuff they say, so self-important, so mentally ill, so fallen that they don't even know how dumb they are when Macron calls the entire French parliament into the palace of the Sun King, Versailles,
[15:26.000 --> 15:36.000]  and implements emergency measures not in since the end of World War II, martial law, that's headlines, emergency powers.
[15:36.000 --> 15:45.000]  He declared emergency powers, martial law, remember Hollandei, Hollan just did it a few years ago for a few months as a beta test.
[15:45.000 --> 15:55.000]  And then he said, I will now rule as a Jupiterian god of Rome. I am Jupiter.
[15:55.000 --> 16:02.000]  Well, we've got video coming up where he tries to force his way into the front line with Trump to get beside him.
[16:02.000 --> 16:09.000]  Here's Trump just saying, I'm a man of a blue-collar billionaire. I believe in you. The people is the engine of freedom, the engine of innovation.
[16:09.000 --> 16:17.000]  I want to be with you. I want to empower you. You empower me. We're just people working together for a better future.
[16:17.000 --> 16:25.000]  And there's the little Jupiterian god trying to run down and get in the front row. That's coming up.
[16:25.000 --> 16:31.000]  It's on infowars.com. Trying to run up and get in the front row. Oh yeah, you're acting like a god.
[16:31.000 --> 16:40.000]  You're acting like some little puppet who wants to get by the real man, not a god, but a man of courage, a man of vision, a man of destiny,
[16:40.000 --> 16:47.000]  a man who believes in humanity and ingenuity and innovation. You have to come scrabbling down a puppet made by others,
[16:47.000 --> 16:54.000]  literally created by Goldman Sachs and the Rothschilds, literally works for them, created as some teenage sex bot
[16:54.000 --> 17:02.000]  who was admittedly a sex toy of the elite as a child, as a 14-year-old. That's what we know about.
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.000]  They're just getting us ready for it all. Trying to scrabble down to get beside Trump so he could look big.
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.000]  Yeah, here's some of the video for TV viewers. The video is up on infowars.com.
[17:12.000 --> 17:21.000]  Fox and Friends and others covered it. Bottom left-hand side of the screen, scrabbling down to get next to President Trump.
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  Look, he's not even supposed to be there on the edge, groveling to Trump, the same guy he's constantly attacking and knowing after.
[17:28.000 --> 17:40.000]  The god. So I can ghostbusters. Zool asked them, are you a god? They said, no, then die.
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.000]  He says, next time somebody asks you if you're a god, you tell them yes.
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.000]  A no amount of pyramids in the night and all-seeing eyes will make you a god fool.
[17:52.000 --> 18:02.000]  You little greedy, selfish monster. God gave you the path to the entire universe through your progeny and through the long march that humanity has to earn.
[18:02.000 --> 18:10.000]  And then you just sit there and declare yourself a god because you reportedly pop synthetic high-tech ecstasy every day and think you are a god.
[18:10.000 --> 18:16.000]  You're just a dime a dozen, another delusional nobody. And it goes further.
[18:16.000 --> 18:30.000]  CNN says, and the fake news king, Acosta says, that Trump got absolutely dissed by the Polish First Lady and that Merkel, you know, he grabbed her hand or whatever.
[18:30.000 --> 18:42.000]  No one wants to shake his hand. He's such a failure. He's such a nobody. And they sit there with cameras watching, waiting while he shakes hundreds of hands for somebody to go past him
[18:42.000 --> 18:50.000]  and shake Melania's hand first because hers was already outstretched. That happens to everybody. Anytime you go out in public at a wedding or whatever, it happens to everybody.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  They turn it in to he's a failure. No one wants to shake his hand.
[18:54.000 --> 19:04.000]  Imagine the pathetic viewers, the few hundred thousand that watch the average show, the few million that still watch CNN total, who see that and think, oh good, he's a failure.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  We're still in the end club. You're not in the end club watching CNN. The globalists don't give you anything.
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  You just fantasize that you're part of the elite, and then you fantasize that Trump's failing, and you fantasize that no one wants to shake his hand.
[19:17.000 --> 19:25.000]  How pathetic. And so they tell you Melania wouldn't hold his hand in Israel. She's like 10 feet behind him about to shake somebody else's hand.
[19:25.000 --> 19:35.000]  He puts his hand back. She's not there. Oh my gosh, no one wants to touching. He shunned. He's a nobody. He's not a maverick. He's a failure.
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  He isn't his own man. He gets it all from Bannon. He gets it all from Alex Jones. He gets it all from Roger Stone.
[19:41.000 --> 19:50.000]  Let me tell you something. You talk to Trump, he does the talking. It just shows how unbelievable their disinfo is and how it's failing.
[19:50.000 --> 20:00.000]  CNN has gone to one star on iTunes overnight and they have lower ratings than re-heirs of Yogi Bear. It's all coming up.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former Congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[20:05.000 --> 20:13.000]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[20:13.000 --> 20:20.000]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob. Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[20:20.000 --> 20:27.000]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way. It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[20:27.000 --> 20:36.000]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love. Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.

[24:21.000 --> 24:38.000]  All right, a lot of good news going on, but don't forget we've also got the situation where top military commander in the Pacific is saying we are ready to hit North Korea
[24:38.000 --> 24:47.000]  and that President Trump is preparing very, very serious actions because they are clear and present danger with nuclear weapons threatening to preemptively strike folks.
[24:47.000 --> 24:55.000]  That's like taking a gun out, loading a bullet into the chamber, putting it to somebody's head and saying I'll pull the trigger.
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  You have a right to stand up against that person. And it shows how truly mentally ill they are.
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.000]  U.S. vows tough for action on North Korea after missile test. I want to get to Putin and Trump's first meeting here in a moment.
[25:09.000 --> 25:24.000]  But first off today, what do you make of the total collapse of CNN and the fact that you can really officially as a media analyst say that CNN is dead?
[25:24.000 --> 25:42.000]  I am here to declare on 7-7, the 7th day of July 2017. Think about that, it's 7-7-17.
[25:42.000 --> 25:54.000]  Good old lucky 7s that CNN is officially dead because mainstream media from the Washington Post to others are all turning on them.
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  They have ratings lower than basically anything on cable, lower than reruns of Yogi Bear.
[26:01.000 --> 26:12.000]  We have those Nielsen ratings up on infowars.com. We are seeing the total collapse of very fake news.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  So you can mark this date. They're still going to leave a facade up. They're going to keep up appearances. They don't want to admit they've been totally destroyed.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  It's like, Piers Morgan. I said, watch, Piers Morgan, after I was on a show, I said he'll be off the air in one year.
[26:24.000 --> 26:38.000]  And a year later, he was off the air and I predicted, I said, but they'll still give him a monthly magazine show for a year so they can quietly bury him and it's not embarrassing.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  And how did I know that? Because that's what they always do.
[26:41.000 --> 26:49.000]  Brian Williams, when he got caught lying about, you know, being shot down in helicopters and beating Muhammad Ali in a heavyweight boxing match,
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  and you know, all the other ridiculous, he didn't really say that I'm being sarcastic. He didn't say he got shot down in a helicopter and a lot of other fake news.
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  They gave him a monthly magazine show, but they think you're so stupid they've all been caught lying. They've brought him back to MSNBC to do reports on fake news.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  I guess they think you'll get confused and go, oh, he's the fake news expert. I do associate him with fake news.
[27:12.000 --> 27:21.000]  I guess he's the expert that exposes it, not one of the biggest charlatans this country and this world have ever seen.
[27:21.000 --> 27:37.000]  But stick a big old fat juicy fork in it. CNN is dead. CNN, I declare CNN politically, credibility-wise, ratings-wise by every yardstick.
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  Hit me like if I had some benefactor, which we don't have, that would pay the $40 million a year.
[27:43.000 --> 27:53.000]  Yes, that's how much it costs to run an operation with almost 100 crew members and folks now and all the bandwidth and the infrastructure and the legal and all of it.
[27:53.000 --> 27:59.000]  Sounds like a lot. It's not. Medium-sized newspapers cost that much to run today.
[27:59.000 --> 28:08.000]  But imagine if I didn't have 40, 50 million viewers and listeners a week and then we were just spending, CNN spent something like a billion a year.
[28:08.000 --> 28:17.000]  Imagine if a billion a year just keeps getting spent and they've got 100,000 viewers on average. That's pretending you're a news agency.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  That's pretending people are still watching you. That's pretending you still have an effect.
[28:22.000 --> 28:32.000]  And instead of backing off the lies that brought them to this point, that the WikiLeaks documents, the fake polls, the giving the questions, war and for the debates, Hillary directing everything.
[28:32.000 --> 28:50.000]  Instead of that, CNN is quadrupling with Acosta, attacks Trump for holding a fake news conference, and then gets his facts wrong saying Trump is lying, saying that 17 agencies didn't unanimously say that Russia gave him the election.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  And those agencies have now said we never said that. The New York Times made that up. This has been a huge controversy for two weeks.
[28:57.000 --> 29:05.000]  But he thinks CNN viewers are that dumb. Trump got it right. He said it was only three agencies said it. And it wasn't even agencies.
[29:05.000 --> 29:15.000]  It was analysts from those agencies that had worked for Obama. So Trump actually didn't get it completely right. It's worse than what President Trump said.
[29:15.000 --> 29:27.000]  Trump got it basically right. It was three people. He said three agencies. It was not three agencies. It was people from three agencies that have been up Obama's rear end and clapper's rear end the entire time.
[29:27.000 --> 29:48.000]  So that's all coming up straight ahead. And then the intrepid reporter for rebel media, Laurel Omer, who confronted the so-called journalist, the king of fake news, Chris Como, the Carlioni of the communist news network confronted on his lies straight ahead.
[29:58.000 --> 30:14.000]  After a series of embarrassments and scandals, CNN is in full blown crisis mode, with the network now attracting fewer viewers for its primetime shows than multi-decade old reruns of Yogi Bear,
[30:14.000 --> 30:24.000]  with the Trump-Russia collusion story fading into the background, an issue that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings despite knowing it was fake news.
[30:24.000 --> 30:40.000]  The network's ratings are now plummeting, and there's no doubt that CNN's most recent scandal that sparked hashtag CNN blackmail has played a role after CNN threatened to dock some random gift creator that President Trump happened to retweet.
[30:40.000 --> 30:56.000]  To add things into perspective, the CNN app now has only one star out of five in the Apple App Store, where comparably the Fox News app has three and a half stars, whereas the InfoWars and Alex Jones' radio app have both four and a half stars.
[30:56.000 --> 31:11.000]  I'm Milla Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[31:27.000 --> 31:37.000]  To the best job you can to purify your error, the elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.000 --> 31:59.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:17.000 --> 32:23.000]  A month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[32:23.000 --> 32:36.000]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[32:36.000 --> 32:49.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important. The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[32:49.000 --> 32:55.000]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[32:55.000 --> 33:10.000]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[33:25.000 --> 33:41.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:41.000 --> 33:50.000]  Last night in Texas, left me in a haze.
[33:50.000 --> 33:59.000]  And Rob Zombie knows how to do his cover songs, doesn't he? With Ken A'Kane.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  Hoka is his game.
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.000]  Alright, let's get serious and get focused here.
[34:07.000 --> 34:23.000]  We're in a really good mood because everything CNN and MSNBC and ABC News and NBC Touch is turning into explosions in their face. They've got the hand grenade touch, but they pull the pin of the hand grenade and it blows up in their face.
[34:23.000 --> 34:39.000]  We're going to be talking to the reporter who staked out CNN and talked to the wannabe celebrity Chris Como with his driver and his black SUV and feeling important, feeling powerful.
[34:39.000 --> 34:54.000]  You can do that for like $50 per ride. They do that for all their CNN people to, again, create the illusion, like psychological warfare chief Eber Bernays said back in the 20s, that they are the new royalty.
[34:54.000 --> 35:11.000]  Make the media with red carpets, with flash bulbs. They used to send out to get the pump primed to Hollywood events as soon as the talkies started, people with cameras to take pictures from the production studio to create the illusion that these were really important people.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  It's all an act.
[35:14.000 --> 35:27.000]  But at least in the old days they had giant audiences and fooled the population for a while. Now the population of the world, but particularly Western Europe, United States, hates Hollywood and cannot stand it.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  China is lapping it up right now, especially dumb down propaganda. That's why most Hollywood films you see have kind of a Chinese communist, you know, weird angle and Hollywood admits that.
[35:36.000 --> 35:49.000]  So that's also accelerating the demise of the sickening, fetid, globalist establishment and cannot make me any more happier. People are so sick of teleprompters, they're so sick of garbage.
[35:49.000 --> 36:01.000]  So Laura Lumer joining us in Trevon Reporter, she got arrested for getting up during their murder the president, CNN funded play, and just simply said no more calls for political violence as they've been doing.
[36:01.000 --> 36:09.000]  We are clearly saying we don't want violence. CNN won't decry it against the president of Congress, must police or others. They have guests almost say the shooter wasn't evil.
[36:09.000 --> 36:20.000]  When we do joke memes and stuff that show Indiana Jones, you know, blasting the CNN logo or I'm throwing darts at Anderson Cooper, the last thing I want is harm to Anderson Cooper.
[36:20.000 --> 36:37.000]  Because Anderson Cooper is a joke. Anderson Cooper never had viewers in the 10 years he's been on air, but now he's really a joke. In fact, I hope they keep the facade propped up, the living dead propped up because CNN is officially dead with credibility with ratings you name it.
[36:37.000 --> 36:55.000]  There's no resuscitating it, but watching them prop it up kind of like, you know, the weekend at CNN's, the weekend at Bernie's, watching it rot and then you'll crows pull the eyeballs out and the tongue hanging out swelling up and the guts swelling up and bursting, you know, all over the stage.
[36:55.000 --> 37:11.000]  I mean, just seeing the decay and then the worms pouring out of the mouth and the pus squirting out of the ears. I mean, it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on. It just can't get any better.
[37:11.000 --> 37:27.000]  Everybody knows I've been on air 22 years when stuff's negative and we're in trouble. I will tell you we're losing to get you up off your butt and to take action. But let me tell you right now. The arrogance of people like Zucker, thinking we're a bunch of dumb efforts is beautiful.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  And it's only accentuating our victories. Now they've got a few aces in the hole.
[37:33.000 --> 37:53.000]  Secrets nobody knows, but we're going to get into those Laura Lomer in just a moment. First off, ladies and gentlemen, we are running specials right now, 30% off on X to the deep earth, good halogen, the opposite of the fluoride, the bromine, the chlorine, the good, true iodine, not the toxic garbage.
[37:53.000 --> 38:05.000]  That they spew out, you know, that you can pick up at the store or whatever that's for topical, but the real clean, true iodine, not some, you know, byproduct of industrial use, but real clean iodine.
[38:05.000 --> 38:18.000]  We're the only folks that have it. Infowarslife.com. Your purchase makes it possible. DNA Force with, again, the only biologically derived form of BioPQQ.
[38:18.000 --> 38:30.000]  Everything else out there, there's some other brands that put out the real stuff, but every other version is synthetic and it's still $40, $50, $60 a bottle, just for a small dose of the synthetic stuff.
[38:30.000 --> 38:46.000]  But the studies out there show that that's not being absorbed as much. 170 plus studies on BioPQQ, you know, we're even allowed to make claims on this because it's known to regrow nerves, it's known to detoxify the mitochondria in the cells.
[38:46.000 --> 39:02.000]  This is amazing. It's an amazing, it's the ultimate antioxidant. Something like 40 kegs, 40 little, you know, packages of blueberries don't have the same antioxidant effect as one dose of BioPQQ and that's in each pill.
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  And we've got a bunch of other stuff, the CoQ10 and a bunch of other patented acids and other amino acids that help you upload it better.
[39:09.000 --> 39:18.000]  DNA Force is back 20% off even though it's been five months since we've had it. We're sitting in the form of the July Specials with free shipping on top of that, an additional 10% off.
[39:18.000 --> 39:24.000]  When you sign up for auto-ship, some of these products are lost leaders. By the way, you hear a lot of my Patreon supply ads on radio.
[39:24.000 --> 39:31.000]  They're the biggest company in the U.S. now, just been around nine years, but because of quality, because of affordability, they become the dominant company in the U.S.
[39:31.000 --> 39:42.000]  I signed a special deal two years ago to be able to private label their entire line, still drop ship by them, to get around their contracts with other distributors and suppliers, to give it to you 30% to 40% off.
[39:42.000 --> 39:50.000]  Now, usually it's only 10% off from my contract, but I'm allowed to a few times a year to have it 30% to 40% off. We're doing that right now. It's about to end.
[39:50.000 --> 40:00.000]  You will not get my Patreon at cheaper anywhere except m4store.com or 888-253-3139 and I hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[40:00.000 --> 40:07.000]  I think we're going to fix North Korea. I hope that the regime takes out Kim Jong-un. I hope China continues to put pressure on him.
[40:07.000 --> 40:15.000]  But if stuff goes sideways and top analysts say this is the most dangerous time ever, you're going to need water filtration, you're going to need storeable foods, you're going to need firearms,
[40:15.000 --> 40:27.000]  and I just hope if you're getting prepared and provisioned on the front of water filtration, which you need anyways, and storeable foods at m4store.com or 888-253-3139.
[40:27.000 --> 40:39.000]  Again, thank you all for your support. Finally, please support our local affiliates, become a sponsor, support their sponsors, let the sponsors know you're supporting them because you support the broadcast and the station,
[40:39.000 --> 40:53.000]  or send them 100 bucks a month. Stop tithing to that New World Order church that won't stand up against globalism or abortion or world government or won't speak out against gun control or scare the IRS even though it's your first amendment, right?
[40:53.000 --> 40:59.000]  If you want to tithe, tithe the local radio station that's telling the truth and putting this broadcast on air.
[40:59.000 --> 41:08.000]  You want to tithe, tithe to your own health, your family's own health and this broadcast, sign up for autoship and get discounts on great products, 360 wins.
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  Using what God gave us through Mother Nature to counter the globalist onslaught, a win-win.
[41:13.000 --> 41:23.000]  Now, Laura Loomer is an amazing reporter and journalist. I can't go over all the great things that she's obviously done. She's with the rebel.media.
[41:23.000 --> 41:32.000]  I was just talking to their founder and one of the main owners of it just the other day. He's going to come down and visit me in the next month here in Texas to talk about working more with rebel media because I love the work they're doing.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  And I want to try to synergistically magnify in a win-win anybody that's fighting tyranny.
[41:37.000 --> 41:49.000]  She and others like Jack Busovic and, of course, many others have been camped outside the fake news mothership CNN, the besieged mothership, where we've officially declared their post-mortem.
[41:49.000 --> 42:01.000]  They are dead on arrival due to lying, cheating, stealing, fraud, racketeering, intimidation, blackmail, scams, taking foreign money from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to push pro-Wahhabist views.
[42:01.000 --> 42:10.000]  Hundreds of millions of dollars we now know. Oh, yeah. That's from internal sources. We've had some on to launch the Arab Spring, promote the jihad worldwide.
[42:10.000 --> 42:25.000]  They are a true enemy of this country. And Laura Loomer, I guess it was yesterday, staked out and ran into the thug brother of the governor of New York, Chris Como, who said, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[42:25.000 --> 42:43.000]  Only he is. And, of course, the memes are, you're not allowed to blackmail only CNN can. And so, again, as a con man, he continued with his arrogance to the end that he's in charge and everything's fine as the facade of the thug is propped up.
[42:43.000 --> 42:55.000]  But again, even the yes men around him hate him. Even his own producers are in three different videos saying everyone hates him. He's an idiot. He's arrogant. He's stupid. He doesn't even know what he's doing. He can hardly read off a teleprompter. Everyone hates him.
[42:55.000 --> 43:05.000]  He's only here because of his brother. This place is collapsing. The toilets are overflowing. There isn't even janitorial service. I mean, I've been inside there. It is a filth hole.
[43:05.000 --> 43:17.000]  I mean, I announced when I was there four years ago that it was dead already, but now it's official. And so this is all they've got is, again, their own lies that they're still still surviving.
[43:17.000 --> 43:26.000]  Laura Loomer, do you agree with me that we could declare singing in dead at this point and they're just being propped up like Bernie?
[43:26.000 --> 43:42.000]  Yeah, I agree. 110% Alex. It's really sad when people are more concerned with memeing CNN than they are actually watching CNN. And that's the point that CNN has finally reached.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  All they are is a clown to be pillory.
[43:47.000 --> 44:15.000]  No, I mean, they've become a total joke. And as we've seen over the past two weeks or so with the combination of the Project Veritas videos and embarrassing comments from CNN commentators and anchors and just a continued implosion in the media, I don't know how they're still functioning as a network.
[44:15.000 --> 44:26.000]  Well, they've got to prop it up just like they did when Pierce Morgan finally left. I predicted because it wasn't hard to predict that they would put him out in the pasture with a once a month magazine show.
[44:26.000 --> 44:34.000]  But see, you can't put a 24 hour so-called news station that's fake news that's branded as anti-American filth from WikiLeaks until now.
[44:34.000 --> 44:49.000]  You can't turn that off without it being really a death knell the entire industry. But I think that now the rest of fake news industry has turned against them. I believe that is the final bellwether that they know it's dead and no resuscitation.
[44:49.000 --> 45:00.000]  Well, yeah, I would agree, but it's not dead until their advertisers pull out. So people really want to put a nail in the coffin. They need to really start taking action into their own hands and going after the advertisers.
[45:00.000 --> 45:12.000]  It's really up to the American people to put pressure on all of these groups and organizations and media companies that sponsor CNN.
[45:12.000 --> 45:21.000]  So if we're able to convince them to drop their sponsorship and funding of CNN, then we're able to take down CNN once and for all.
[45:21.000 --> 45:31.000]  Just similar to what Mike Cernovich was saying as well too, you need to go after the airports that refuse to show any other news coverage besides CNN fake news.
[45:31.000 --> 45:40.000]  We need to target them and all of their sponsors, all of their advertisers and make them completely irrelevant, just non-existent.
[45:40.000 --> 45:47.000]  I've sat there hundreds of times in airports and noticed that no one's watching CNN. I guarantee you, and I don't want to be on the airports.
[45:47.000 --> 45:57.000]  That would be a badge of dishonor and we were state run, but if they put your show, my show, any real show on, talking about real issues with real energy, people pick up its teleprompter free instantly.
[45:57.000 --> 46:06.000]  Everyone would be glued to those TVs, but no one watches it because they know it's like the prison food. Nobody wants to eat it.
[46:06.000 --> 46:13.000]  Well, it's supposed to be white noise, right? It's propaganda. They just want you to hear it as you're walking through the airport.
[46:13.000 --> 46:29.000]  No one really watches the news when they're in the airport, but if you hear that fake news ringing in your ear in the background as you're waiting for hours for a layover, they're just driving propaganda into your mind.
[46:29.000 --> 46:46.000]  And that's really why I think that these airports are so useful as a tactic for CNN for spreading fake news and indoctrinating people on the left and just creating really a civil war within this country.
[46:46.000 --> 46:53.000]  That's the goal of CNN in my opinion. So we've got to get it out of the airports.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  That's right. I'm going to go ahead and announce this meme because I want everybody to make it.
[46:57.000 --> 47:06.000]  We'd have Rowdy Piper when the drone flies over and he goes, hello, my little friend, come to tell them where I am. Not nice. And he shotguns it.
[47:06.000 --> 47:14.000]  And we're not calling for violence when we do that. It's that we're just simply pointing out that we want it out of our consciousness.
[47:14.000 --> 47:20.000]  We in our own minds are permanently marking it as absolutely enemy transmissions.
[47:20.000 --> 47:31.000]  But CNN doesn't have a problem with violence. I don't know if people know this, but Time Warner CNN was one of the top media sponsors of the Julius Caesar play here in New York.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  But now that the tables have turned on them, they're all of a sudden, you know, anti anti violence.
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.000]  But where were they speaking out a few weeks ago when people were encouraging the assassination of Donald Trump, right?
[47:42.000 --> 47:53.000]  You know, so I don't want to hear CNN complain about how memes are threatening and, you know, memes are violent because CNN has never cared about inciting violence.
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.000]  All they do is incite violence 24 seven with their fake news propaganda.
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  And by the way, how was your case going? Were you charged? I know you got arrested.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  I mean, when Antifa runs up and takes over events for hours and lets no one speak in New York, that's totally normal.
[48:08.000 --> 48:17.000]  DeBlasio loves it. But you just went up there for a minute and said stop promoting political violence right after Congressmen's police had been shot because they wouldn't decry it.
[48:17.000 --> 48:24.000]  Yeah, not even a minute, 33 seconds. But yeah, I have court in August, August 14th is my court date.
[48:24.000 --> 48:30.000]  And, you know, I've been working with a lawyer to see, you know, what the best case scenario would be.
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.000]  But I just am waiting till my court date.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  Now set this up for us where you confronted Como yesterday.
[48:39.000 --> 48:48.000]  So I staked out of CNN and Jeff Zucker's residence actually yesterday, all morning.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  You have to be there very early because of course these shows begin very early in the morning.
[48:53.000 --> 49:04.000]  And, you know, I currently have the addresses and schedules for nearly every single CNN anchor that lives in New York City, right?
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  So this is only going to continue.
[49:06.000 --> 49:22.000]  I waited outside of the CNN Headquarter here in New York and I pinpointed Cuomo's driver and I positioned myself near the vehicle so that when he was getting out of the building, I would be there as he was entering.
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  And let's roll from there. Here it is.
[49:27.000 --> 49:37.000]  Mr. Cuomo, I have a quick question for you. Why did you delete a tweet in which you were encouraging the extortion of a Reddit user who posted a meme about CNN?
[49:37.000 --> 49:45.000]  There was no encouraging any extortion. It wasn't a teenager. And the reason I took the tweet down was because the decision had already been made.
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.000]  I thought it was more conditional about whether or not his name was going to be released than it was.
[49:50.000 --> 49:58.000]  His name was already, you know, going to be kept private because of his own actions and their concerns about his privacy.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  So it didn't make any sense. So I took it down. It's not the first time I deleted it.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  Do you think that it's appropriate for CNN to be targeting private citizens over memes that CNN doesn't like?
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.000]  I don't think that's what happened. And I think you should look at the other content that was on that site and think about who you're defending.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Don't you think it's free speech?
[50:14.000 --> 50:15.000]  You heard what I said, right?
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  But you guys accused Trump of bullying.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  Then she got approached by CNN security for talking to someone on the street or bullying.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  You can not take a picture or report off the town on a CNN. You have to move to the site.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  You're not allowed to report.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  Yeah, you can record on the street. You jackass.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  It's a public sideline.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  That's CNN security getting my face after I destroyed.
[50:41.000 --> 50:42.000]  Here's Morgan.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Thanks.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  Unbelievable. She's out on the sidewalk in a public column. She's out the street.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  And they're saying she has no First Amendment. Again, bullies, bullies, thug bullies.

[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  People sleeping in their shoes.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  There's a warning sign on the road ahead.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got big breaking news.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  This just broke in the Associated Press in the last 10 minutes.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  Now, do I believe fake news? AP got caught in a big fake news scandal.
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  Normally, you can't believe a lot of what the AP says, but if it's an official release by President Trump, it's been announced by the White House.
[54:52.000 --> 54:58.000]  WhiteHouse.gov will put it on screen, and I will read that on screen for folks.
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.000]  They're printing it for me now, but if we can just put that article on screen, I will read it.
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  Again, we're teleprompter-free, but they can put articles on screen for me.
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  AP Sources.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  U.S.-Russia Reach Deal on Syria Cease Fire.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  Now, just two minutes ago, this is only three lines.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Now, it's a whole story. They're getting more info.
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  We'll go to the next hour a little bit, Laura Lomers, as you can finish up.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  The United States and Russia have reached agreement on a ceasefire in southwest Syria.
[55:25.000 --> 55:34.000]  Three U.S. officials said Friday, as President Donald Trump held his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin,
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  the deal marks a new level of involvement with the U.S. in trying to resolve Syria's civil war.
[55:39.000 --> 55:44.000]  It tells about the agreement and how it will be implemented, weren't immediately available.
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.000]  The ceasefire is set to take effect Saturday or Sunday at noon Damascus time,
[55:51.000 --> 55:57.000]  and the officials who weren't authorized to discuss the ceasefire publicly spoke addition anonymity.
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.000]  Jordan and Israel also are part of the agreement.
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  One of the officials said the two U.S. allies both share a border with the southern part of Syria
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  and have been concerned about violence from Syrian civil war spilling over the border.
[56:12.000 --> 56:19.000]  The deal to separate from the de-escalation zones that were to be created under the deal brokered by the Russians.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Turkey and Iran earlier this year.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  The U.S. was not part of that deal.
[56:23.000 --> 56:32.000]  Follow-up talks this week in Kazhikistan to finalize a ceasefire in those zones failed to reach agreement.
[56:32.000 --> 56:39.000]  Russia has been backing opposing sides of the Syrian war with Moscow supporting Syria president Bashar Assad
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  and Washington supporting rebels who have been fighting Assad.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  Both the U.S. and Russia oppose the Islamic State group in Syria.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  That's AP lying right there.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.000]  I've interviewed the folks that briefed Congress, both on air and off air.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  Some of them general, some of them colonels.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  You know, Colonel Shaffer.
[56:55.000 --> 56:59.000]  98% of them are al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, Wahhabist.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  They're Sunni.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  They are backed by Saudi Arabia.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  They are the group.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  And so when you hear the U.S. has been backing the moderate rebels, that was under Obama.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Not now with Trump.
[57:11.000 --> 57:17.000]  That's why they've almost knocked out al-Qaeda and Syria and ISIS because now we're able to go after them.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  They're not moderate rebels.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  They're posing as moderate rebels.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  They're almost defeated.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  So now the time is coming for Assad to step down.
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  As he told the Pentagon, he would do five years ago when they came in and didn't let Obama launch a ground war.
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.000]  Now it's time for Assad to begin the elections and moving out once the final pockets are mopped up.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  We're going to come back with five more minutes with Laura Lerner and her confrontation with fake news king Chris Como.
[57:39.000 --> 57:44.000]  But first, here's a clip of the press conference they were having before they went into another meeting.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  And these announcements were made just in the last 10 minutes here.
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.000]  It's President Trump meeting with President Vladimir Putin.
[57:52.000 --> 58:00.000]  It's going very well. We've had some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue.
[58:00.000 --> 58:08.000]  But we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned.
[58:08.000 --> 58:16.000]  I'm sitting honored to be with you.
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.000]  We've got another clip here of them first shaking hands. Trump came over to find where Putin was at to shake his hand.
[58:22.000 --> 58:34.000]  Our media, our government, the shadow government, the deep state has been trying to keep people from just believing that our presidents allowed to meet with foreign leaders.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  He is. He's the president.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  Final comments from Laura Lerner straight ahead.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  Then Steve Quayle on the North Korea situation, your phone calls and more.
[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  Thanks, Jones. This is history happening. Stay with us.
[58:50.000 --> 58:57.000]  Let's go to Debit in Florida. Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[58:57.000 --> 59:03.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[59:03.000 --> 59:13.000]  It was on the fence by it because I've got caveman, superman vitality, secret swell, vitamin, mineral fusion. I've got the body armor.
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  Wow, thank you. You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which pharmaceutical does you like best?
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's amazing.
[59:21.000 --> 59:26.000]  That's incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt the week.
[59:26.000 --> 59:38.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys. I love the info wars through and I just want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  You will love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  The limelight. We know Marcon, believing he's a god, is not in the limelight.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  A wide open wonderment of the universe. Not eliminated. Believes he's eliminated.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  All he's done is tie his spirit to darkness.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  Coming up in the next segment, AP, U.S. Russia Reach Deal on Syria, ceasefire.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  Big news. Steve Quell will join us.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  We'll talk about North Korea and more with top U.S. commander in the Pacific, saying U.S. ready to launch military operations against North Korea.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  Laura Loomer, you finish up with the great work you're up to. What happened?
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  Colmo trying to act arrogant. Where do you see the future of fake news going? What it signifies to have the rest of the fake news turning on CNN?
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Well, like I said, I'm going to continue to go after CNN and expose them.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  As I mentioned, I have the personal information of nearly every single top anchor on every CNN program.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So, you know, it's going to happen. They're going to be confronted.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  You know, I just see it's a continued downfall, right? I don't see CNN having any chance of saving itself, any chance of redemption.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I predict that in the coming weeks, people will start to put pressure on the advertisers and more advertisers will drop their support from CNN.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I think it's very dismal at this point for CNN and the fake news media.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  It's not just CNN, though, right? They're probably the shining example or the face of what it means to be fake news.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  But, you know, there's also a problem with MSNBC and a lot of these other, you know, mainstream media propagandists like the New York Times, for example, the Washington Post.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  They all need to be taken down. I don't know what your thoughts are on this, but I think really it lies in the hands of the American people and citizen journalists, right?
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Because the mainstream media doesn't want to report on the fake news. They don't want to hold each other accountable because they're all friends at the end of the day.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  So, it's up to people in the...
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  I agree, though. So, what does it signify? They're starting to turn on each other because they're all complete jokes. What does that signify?
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Well, it's a war, right? They're imploding. It's bad enough when the American people hate you, but from within, we're seeing that there's a lack of communication and that they're tearing each other apart from within.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  You know, you saw in the James O'Keefe video, the producer for Chris Cuomo said that he couldn't stand listening to him talk, that nobody at CNN likes Chris Cuomo.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  So, clearly, they have a lack of communication. They hate each other. And if you can't support yourself in a time of war, you're going to lose.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  In the last minute and a half, we have Laura Loomer of the Rebel Media.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  What are they going to do to counter this? I mean, we know they've done false flags. We know they're trying to start wars. We know they're trying to bring in Islamists.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  How do you think they're going to respond? I mean, they've been pushing violence as well.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Right. Well, I have a theory that CNN is going to stage an attack on one of their own reporters or anchors, right?
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  We see that they had no problem creating a fake news story with Russia and pushing this propaganda for what, over a year and a half now. So what's to say that they wouldn't stage violence or some type of gun attack?
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  They promoted the Arab Spring that's killed over a million people.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  Yeah. So I predict that in the coming weeks, we'll see something, another staged news story where a CNN anchor was walking down the street and they were attacked by a citizen journalist or someone fired a gun or someone did something.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  But it's going to be completely made up and enforced by the fake news media.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And then they're going to show all the joke memes and everything of, you know, prompt biting people's heads off or whatever.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  Just like all of these hate crimes that are hoaxes. Yeah, of course, some of them are real. But how many of these hoaxes have we seen since Donald Trump said that?
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  99% are hoaxes. Laura Lomer, you're absolutely right. And now, even if CNN stayed something, nobody buys into it. I mean, we just don't believe anything they say. They can say the sky was blue.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  We'll be right back with Steve Quayle. Stay with us.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  I'm married to an impeached former president who is also a rapist. My last president is also involved, as he has absconded in his hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified information leaking to the public.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor involved with me all die mysteriously in less than a year. I had multiple members of my party arrested for pedophilic activity this year.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  I didn't mention Trump Russia yet.

[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Thanks Alex Jones.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Well over in Germany today 100,000 Soros funded goons they admittedly are funded by Soros. This is just a joke how bad he is. Are running around burning police cars breaking cars attacking shops. While the Trumps and their family all glamorously walk around inside the
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  cord and promoting Western civilization and battling radical Orthodox Islam. The globalist went too far in their open alliance with Islam and an attempt to flood Europe and the United States with Muslims to then make us basically submit to them and convert to the
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  end of free speech in the name of not stirring them up that has failed and that's even gotten a lot of the intelligence agencies and people to finally turn against globalism and for Trump to go to Poland yesterday and declare that they will never overthrow
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  the West. It's not a racist idea. It's an idea of Renaissance true free societies. You can live here as long as you let others live. It's amazing CNN's Alliance with the Arab Spring with Al Qaeda with ISIS. It's all coming home to roost. It's all coming out.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Now Steve Quell has been talking about the leftist alliance with Islam for 20 years I've known and quite frankly that's one of the things that I just couldn't believe 20 years ago or 15 years ago hearing folks like David Horowitz talk about it.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  But truly they've cited I guess it's a billion and a half Muslims and their numbers are set to double most of the world population growth is Muslims to 3 billion by like 2025. That's not very far away is it 2026 2027 we're talking 10 years away.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  And so they've made a demographic deal with the devil. I guess during the influx and the transition period to being Demis is the term is like a slave of Islam you you pay a tax you're allowed to live during the processing and then I guess our elites think they'll go along with that.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  It's quite sickening. So I think that's why you see a big revolt against globalism is we're finally getting down to the chopping block here. So there's Merkel and Trump shaking hands. You've got the ceasefire that just got reportedly agreed to by Putin and Trump an hour ago just broke 15 minutes ago.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  All that's taking place then you've got the Vatican the number two guy they say number three but he was really the number two guy the aid to camp to the pope reportedly indicted for rounding up hundreds of children for for for rape and other horrible things.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  This is this is all happening and then gay orgy raids last week. Info wars broke that here in the United States three days before mainstream media. What are they going to do and why is all this happening at once with this final big piece of the puzzle.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  I mean to ask Steve quell who's got a great mind when it comes to this bestselling author big coast to coast gas probably the most popular guest on there and of course his own talk show host when he feels like you know doing it US vows tougher action on North Korea after missile test.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Sometimes US commander in South Korea were prepared for war with North Korea. Trump's considering severe options for North Korea. What they might be we're going to go over some of those and what this could trigger.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Do we have China and Russia on board. They're signaling more and more they are but saying the US shouldn't be doing drills. What are we supposed to do while North Korea threatens to nuke Tokyo and Seoul South Korea.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  This is all escalating and Steve quell Steve quell dot com for the first time ever joins us via video Skype was great having him here in studio with us I guess six months ago or so.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  It's also a documentary filmmaker in his own right a really amazing stuff to carry some of his films and then for store dot com while Steve you heard me just the last three minutes kind of lay out some of the points.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  There's times in history as you've said many times as historians have said were more happens in a few years and happened the previous hundred when it comes to what's going to affect the future I think we're approaching a quickening a tipping point.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  What has been hidden is coming out great good is coming to the world while great evil is coming to the world.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Great understanding is happening more information than ever but never more stupid people never more intelligent people.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  It's very biblical what we see happening world government being announced AI computers being announced human animal hybrids that you talked about 20 years ago now all confirmed they still attack us for talking about it.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  You we're not going to get into this in this interview but you get into Giants that the Bible talks about now they dug up Giants.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  They were only six foot three but for the time that was giant for you know for China there in China all these crazy things starting to you know come to the fore media matters run by George Soros tried to imply that I said man bear pig one half man one half bear one half pig.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  That would be 150% not not one third one third one third I came out and said that I've talked to scientists I've talked to engineers I've talked to genetic engineers how we can show you photos of mice with ears growing on them and pigs that are part human that's mainstream news and they say it's
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  terrifying well they edited it to make it look like I said 80% pig 80% cow I said no they're 80% pig 20% human 80% cow 20% human that's just some of the variance to grow humanoids in uterus that's MIT.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  I'm reading from MIT but again they don't want us to talk about the geoengineering they don't want us to talk about all the things that they admit they're doing but that remain secret and they take the more you know provincial kind of slang
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  terms people use like chemtrails and say that we're saying that there's no such thing as ice crystals.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  There's real condensation we're talking about the CFR the UN the UN treaty 1979 on weather weapons, admitting all this is going on. So Steve quail, you're the guy that first wrote about chemtrails geoengineering 20 plus years ago you're the guy that first wrote about the
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  heroes outside of literature where they admit it show so let's let's get into the current state of the world geopolitically and why so much is happening. Just this justice last month and and where this where this is going.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Well Alex I think it's incredibly timely that we're having this show today because it's on the 17 excuse me 777 you know we're right at the time period. What is a 777 team and that's a very significant number because I've been on record.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  And with you and the shows we've done over the years is saying there's nothing that's been hidden that isn't going to be made known and revealed. And it's happening in the areas of science it's happening in the areas of the super soldier program.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  We've done shows on that but let's talk about North Korea. North Korea is obviously being given advanced technology it's being given background nuclear materials obviously guidance systems to stage rocketry and I want to share this from my background
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  to those and the guys who really know what's going on they're claiming it was a vertical launch and the reason the North Koreans put it vertically as opposed in any type of a trajectory or an arched trajectory was so that this skeptics could
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  say well they don't have ICBMs they most certainly do. Most people don't remember the days of the famous Dr. Khan in Pakistan where literally you could get anything you want and the nuclear weapons delivery guidance systems on the black market if you had the money.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  So the the official club that's achieved nuclear delivery or throw rate capability is way different than those who possess nuclear weapons that may be already strategically placed in the United States.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  I think the North Koreans are absolutely taking their potshots but I also believe that all of the different groups the terrorist groups and some that are in possession of nuclear weapons are basically going to detonate something someplace that will be in my opinion a
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  false flight and because you're in Austin I would really encourage all those who live in Austin the special forces community that obviously you guys have trillion dollar budgets to put space space weaponry and I think it's about time that the good guys in that
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  realm started using it because you know we're hearing rockets counter rocket interceptors S 400 systems from Russia this that the other thing hypersonic missiles but Alex there is a realm of weaponry that all those trillions and actually tens of trillions of dollars have disappeared into
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  and so what I see is basically obviously people are using North Korea to take their best shot they're going to test Donald Trump's will and resolve but again for those good people in the military those ones who know on a majestic level what we have access to space
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  space weapons platform I frontier Danny Graham's project you're talking about you're talking about particle beams radiation weapons that are fifth generation neutron bombs we can take out all of North Korea's military in about two minutes with those and then the only
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  question is that would be I guess you could argue mass murder because the radiation weapons even though more directed now would still kill a lot of civilians but can we just sit here and wait for North Korea to launch a new kit Tokyo
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  no and obviously today and I think this is critical information that Hawaii is telling their people the Hawaiian Islands are critical not just because of Pearl Harbor but on Kauai where the Pacific missile theater ranges that controls the entire Pacific
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  now who would benefit the most from the takeout of Kauai and their barking sans base would obviously blind us and that that's also space command controls the aerial assets so when you've got the Hawaiians and even their governor and political figures
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  you better learn to shelter in place you better be set for 14 days you've got Japanese the picture you saw of the lady huddled under a concrete path between a little creek and and the highway or not the highway the roadway I think it's it's very telling
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  and remember Putin president Putin this is something that people do not understand the idea that civil defense doesn't matter is only in the United States Russia even tested the the repositioning of 40 million of their citizens what does that say
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  President Putin cares about his people our military industrial complex doesn't care about us though the billionaire bunkers and I'm talking about all of the elite they're all headed to higher ground so the fact that Hawaii Japan and Guam is obviously in the target and you know this even
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  I guess hours ago we flew to bombers be one bombers over the disputed area of China well the president China and Donald Trump are sitting next together my prayer is that somebody who's honest and this may be at literally asking God to put a miracle in that someone will fill the president
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  in and by the way presidential security and clearances are not the top there's 28 degrees of top level of security that goes into majestic cosmic now this isn't stuff that is just the
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  space commands been around before NASA but they just announced it this week absolutely and the thing is is that this notice what's happening you can take any subject matter whether it's in the defense whether it's in the biological engineering
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  I'm on record you know this that human cloning has been accomplished decades ago that's admitted I mean they now have admitted okay 30 years ago we created human clones we just killed them in the test tube or in utero no they didn't
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  they didn't and I've literally talked to special operations command generals four stars people in the intelligence community and we've got guys that are professional hitters assassins in the intelligence community weeping about the things that
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  they saw in cages in the underground bases you know how many times have we been said we're or been told we're cookie the alternate media just makes this stuff up
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  let's show a lot of mainstream news articles while we do this online news admitting human animal chimeras have now been gestated MIT are now born but but but we're demanding people show this that the world see this that this be
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  discussed that this be debated I mean I'm going to say the stuff I've been told by high level folks because the media would have a field day with it even though it's in the literature it confirming it now now let's get back to North Korea
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  yes what do you make of the fact that the Kashyyikistan meetings supposedly fell through but when Trump and Putin got together two hours ago they agreed on a ceasefire that's big as we know some of the McMasters and folks wanted a wider war to take
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  out Assad when he never started the war but five years ago the Pentagon did make a deal to ignore Obama and to we first broke the sirens confirmed it now it's mainstream news just to tell folks that Assad would go for elections once we beat ISIS and Al Qaeda and then
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  would leave so we are approaching the point where Assad down the road the next year or so is supposed to start leaving
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  well again this is going to the five year plan that general Wesley Clark spoke about and I would say this everybody should recognize that the United States has more to gain by a friendly relationship between President Putin and President Trump
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  than we do by going to war and when I see the neocons and I see the same people that were cutting deals with the Russian over the uranium you know mines and areas in this country Hillary Clinton the Clinton foundation and claiming Russia's interference
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  if I were Vladimir Putin I would simply say this let me show you our business dealings with the Clinton foundation because again they I believe that Alex you have helped and I say this honestly to reestablish the narrative they are trying to take control of the Russian
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  the narrative to cover their own stink they being the Democrats they being the globalist and I am sure I mean all of us together you know Trump especially but you know Drudge yourself I mean George Norrie I mean everybody the truth is
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  everything they did they blamed on Trump and what you're saying is you know the meeting in Kazakhstan fell through this one has worked because the two men have actually bypassed the bureaucracy that shows why these high level bilateral meetings are important it shows why they didn't
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  want Trump to have this meeting but absolutely Russia if they really want deals and wanted to escalate they should play their trump card which is the fact that they were paying off Hillary and they were paying off the
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  pedestals and so why doesn't Russia play that card well I think and I believe that Russia is waiting to see some given the Trump administration I want to share this with you I know that you know there's stuff we can't talk about and if people fault us and fault the information we
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  give them that's obviously verifiable that's in the headlines that's that's just documented until the there's so many footnotes you don't have enough people to wear the feet with the notes so the idea is simply this is that
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  people are lazy and that's what all the major networks and what I call the vomit brokers I'm going to go on record that is a word they never tell the truth they only give you regurgitate they just regurgitate the same lies forever so so let's expand on this
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  what are they going to do is their whole complex begins to fall as as they're totally discredited as yogi bear reruns have more viewers and CNN and they have you know half a star on itens as they become negative value you're not just worthless
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  negative value what do you expect them to do now I think they're going to go all out war your previous guest was making a statement that I agree with you agree with they will try false flags but people are going to just say
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  enough of it we live in a time period I want to make this statement if we those of us in alternative media have been telling the truth and these guys are proven time and time again to be liars then people should absolutely turn off the
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  networks and that's why people listen to you listen to me listen to those of us in all news because we're telling them look go do your homework and Alex I want to be provocative today to tell people listen when Alex does a show
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  I do a show any of us do shows and we're giving you all the documentation you can possibly want then you got to come to the conclusion is your apathy indifference or your fear keeping you from standing up a speaking up speaking out and putting your financial
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  wherewithal behind it let me ask you this historically the point I believe Trump is a reprieve like like you know Jonah being sent to Nineveh to give them a you know chance to repent I mean I believe
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  that this is our chance not the Trump's perfect anything but this move of nationalism the struggle away from globalism because we were about to with Hillary really go into the end of free speech mass arrest huge wars she said she was going to launch wars World War
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  three I mean true true evil making Hitler look tame was about to hit us and that's the only reason people intelligence agencies a lot of who aren't even good people got cold feet and actually sabotage Hillary was because they realize for their own kids this is insanity
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  I think we all better understand just because we've got a foothold right now a beachhead we better know the real lay of the land speak to that and then please get into where we are geopolitically the players why all what I asked earlier Steve why is it all popping off now why is it all chain
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  chain reaction now well you first of all you have stated and correctly that we've been given a reprieve I remember being on coast to coast before President Trump really announced he was going to run George Norie asked me the question is that an endorsement I said yes because the people that hate him are the people
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  destroying us and if all those people hate President Trump in that day Donald Trump I said I guys got my support now why because I believe that God gives time and nations a space to repent and by repentance I mean they've got to understand that any court
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  even God's eternal court is going to present evidence people say God's not just obviously people say well Hollywood says the devil's a great guy to worship but I believe that Alex seriously when I made the statement that before the United States is destroyed
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  okay this is before President Trump is before Russian China we had any problems with them okay everything was hunky dory that God would reveal the sins of the leaders to the people the people sins before God now look when you talk about pedophiles cannibalism and one of the things I went on record when you started your career and I was on a couple years before you did I said when cannibalism fills the headlines of the news of the day
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  I remember we are at the beginning of the tribulation that's what I said now how could I know that I couldn't okay except that I guess my my position has been to warn to admonish to encourage him says as in the days of Noah so will it be in the days of the son of man
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  absolutely and the thing that people don't understand I've spent 44 years writing about the days of Noah the time period of when when it wasn't just because people were evil it was because of the supernatural presence of evil let me let me share this we were just in Peru my film crew
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  Timothy Alboreno we took a conference of it like 24 people down there including our crew and the thing that was interesting is the cover up is so intense over the if you will the megalithic and cyclopean structures of socks a woman
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  Oshanti Tombo in the middle of Cusco Peru you've got this underground tunnel system and Alex every day now the Aztecs are funding tunnels or the pyramids all over the world
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  oh no it's crazy stay right there we're gonna go to break when we come back since you mentioned it Atlantic Monthly one of the big globalist mouthpieces said we must end Christianity the sun is setting
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Donald Trump you'll never stop it and we're gonna get the white people these are white people saying this all of the news it says bring down the West bring down the West we don't understand as evil as we are
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  you know command bases like LA in places we are still spirits and protected to a certain extent we have Providence you go to these third world countries like it's held by evil it's palpable and it's the den of devils it just it you call it you know the culture the
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  mindset the hundredth monkey people giving themselves over to corruption so it's a it's a six cents whatever it is there's a spirit to nations and evil wants to destroy Russia it wants to destroy the United States because Christianity is coming back in these nations
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  they want to go anywhere in the world they can in Africa the Middle East kill the questions that's what the UN wants why do they want to kill the Christians that's what the real war is about with Steve quell of Steve quell.com straight ahead
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  CNN is in full blown crisis mode with the network now attracting fewer viewers for its prime time shows than multi decade old reruns of yogi bear with the Trump Russia collusion story fading into the background an issue that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings despite

[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  to have water filtration systems regularly not be drinking all the glyphosates and crap is in the water look what it's doing to the fish the mammals the amphibians I mean it's just huge and they're fighting to cover it up saying Jones is crazy you know he's covering up the
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  you know the gay frog stuff or they're covering up the gay frog stuff it's it's just crazy what they're doing or saying I'm making all this up they're desperate I talk about the pope and I talk about his number two guy
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  and died if we're kidnapping and raping all these hundreds of kids reportedly and how it's all coming out and they just make up the story that I say there's a Mars colony of slave kids never said that did disagreed with it when a guest said it this is what they do to change the subject
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  they are desperate they're scared and they're only playing the same old plays over and over again so again talk show host bestselling author researcher filmmaker Steve quell Steve quell dot com joins us a lot of interesting information there to say the least on his site from geopolitical
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  to esoteric to biblical it's all there a Steve going back to you here we went to break we're bringing up the war on Christianity why all this stuff's breaking loose Trump is waging a war with other patriots against the pedophile
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  satanist networks where the pedophilia is only the gateway let's get into why there's a war against Christianity and what you think this reprieve signifies and and and the main thing that you're worried about currently as the globalist test Trump with North Korea
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  well I think the idea Alex is that any source of truth has to be silenced that's why the war is so absolutely blazing against any avenue you me those of us discrediting remember the United States government went on record is saying they're going to have a department of propaganda
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  and that is in full force but here's the way people can defeat that they can absolutely turn it off they don't have to watch ABC they don't have to watch CBS they don't have to listen to any of the gag and sputum that is coming out of the mainstream press
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  now also here is a critical issue you have rightly stated the issue they want to kill Christians they are Chris killing Christians all over those are our brethren those are people you played I saw the light I saw the light to
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  but when we were and I want to share this the purpose of true legends of series dot com is to show people the historic cover up and illustrate or well statement they who control the past determine the future and I'm going to tell I'm going to say this when I wrote the
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  book on Antarctica empire beneath the ice there was hardly anything out there about Antarctica except the stuff that was old newsreel footage the Russian documentary et cetera and then all of a sudden it broke loose and then I said the next thing is going to be Mars
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  and I'm not talking about the kids that story I'm talking about the reality they're claiming that obviously Mars has life has water or may have had life and then that's going to lead ultimately to soft disclosure so true legends of series dot com
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  and I want to share this we're going to break stuff and this is not an empty promise we're going to break stuff in Branson Missouri September 14 through the 17th and it'll be available for live streaming to people all over the world to absolutely show the crushing
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  control of authorities over true history the last thing they want is anything in the Bible either the Old Testament or the New Testament being validated and verified that's why they're fighting so hard and so when people go on the website
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  true legends of series dot com they can watch the trailers and ladies and gentlemen support Alex is all of these DVDs are available on the info war store so Alex as we were and this is critical as we were in Peru how is it that
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  antiquity and the finds in Peru are so being covered up what is it that the authorities there and all over the world fear more than anything and it's true
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  well that's another question you know his name who was the famous head of antiquities for like 30 something years in Egypt who wouldn't let people DNA test and finally he's gone now the new guy let the Germans and the Russians do it and even CNN had to admit
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  that it turns out that it was a Europeans that founded Egypt just like I said
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  yeah it was Hawass that's a guy's last name H A W A I remember you saying that on coast to coast like 20 years ago and 15 years ago with Norrie so you were right about that that's what the Greeks said so so let's briefly get into Egypt and who really founded that
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  well first of all the thing about the Egyptian is as most people don't know this but the word Cairo the little city of Cairo means Mars encampment the late David Flynn who wrote a book called Sidonia the secret chronicles of Mars which I'm the publisher on
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the astronomical coordinates on Mars matched those on earth of the great doctor right there because I can't get people to admit that MIT admits that headline human animal hybrids are chest dating
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  mean in utero in their mothers in the cows mainly they grow the humanoids and they have large large uteruses they get them up larger for organ harvesting about the size of a baby more like 3040 pounds for those that haven't seen it
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  and yes folks it's in medical literature we're doing a documentary on it so they the media attacks you for covering things that are real and says I'm insane but I know when Buzz Aldrin was on I wanted him on about the moon landing because they kept saying we didn't do the
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  moon landing I believed we did the media said I didn't so I wanted to just prove that and have them stop hoaxing and saying that I was you know saying we didn't have a moon landing the truth was I talked to high level NASA folks who are friends of the family one of them died a few years
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  ago Raymond Teague who are on main mission control of the cameras like like so so so my issue was I wanted to have him on he came on my show and only my show then after one other and said there's an obelisk on the moon of Mars there's bases then I was then years later
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  I'm out in LA I talked to buzz Aldrin I'm gonna just leave it at this to some of us off record he tells me all this other wild stuff but then tells me in about a year the Indians will discover water on the moon by crashing a probe in let me know you how we
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  found it we're letting them make the discovery for the world because the world's not ready yet Alex I mean and then I wanted buzz on later I never let that secret out he told me more buzz obviously said oh I've had too much pressure as secretary said buzz can't come on but why is he
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  messing with me because I'm not the one saying this the media is going to say I said that no no buzz Aldrin the second guy to walk on the moon said that
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  no here's the deal what he told you is true and this is something that has got people got understand their people risking their lives and have and many of them are dead people from my background when I say my background people that
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  made contact with me and had told me the most outlandish stories but the Bible says the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established and so Alex when we're talking about stargates the the whole idea of stargates is as old as
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  antiquity I mean they admit they're trying to build one at the headroom collider they dedicated to Shiva that they've been caught doing all these weird mock human sacrifices there what's going on there
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  well here's the deal Jesus said that the gates of hell are going to open but they wouldn't prevail and what a gate is is something either hold something back or allow something through
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  so what Hollywood how about the story on dredge today that what the CIA has been involved in 1800 war movies well let me make it clear that they have controlled the narrative on science fiction for so long because that's the way they would
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  leak the truth invaders from Mars the 1950s I think 5557 black and white film was the first movie to deal with implants literal implants that the Martians put in the little boys parents back and now they're putting
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  brain chips in the troops absolutely so and when when I wrote a certain symbol is three sixes well not only that but that's the destroyer see this is this is why CERN they're opening the gate the Shiva statue that you see in the
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  back room you showed it that absolutely as cosmic destruction and rebirth okay it's a Hindu philosophy of reincarnation which is really the is a variant of the Illuminati Phenos philosophy of the balance of destruction in life or
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  aka Darth Vader right or even even simpler than that order out of chaos see what people don't get is that the power of the Illuminati is real it's not on the same level as God's that he gives to his people but his people
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  don't believe that God you know here's the thing I'm sorry the point is the Satan is believed that Satan's real and gives them power the Christians are always trying to explain away a supernatural God a
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  supernatural savior Jesus Christ and the idea that somehow the intellect of gaining the world's acceptance will win people to Jesus against their contempt so I'm saying this I believe that in getting back to your original question
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  this period we have a time out if you will a time of repentance a time of reflection this is the judge of the whole earth laying out evidence as to what the true nature of the United States primarily is because we were the ones that are
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  funding the globalists and how many years Alex have we gone on decades let's say of warning people all the statements here it is folks are saying they're going to do this here it is folks are doing this and so I just want people to basically every man who's
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  who's listening to this broadcast and listens to your show Alex and listens to those of us who are saying this remember don't allow the emasculation of your ability to procreate truth be stolen by those who are primarily nothing more than
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  just play fantasy football but go out and be involved if you can't admit they're trying to do force vaccines or have chimeras or that 82% of the smallmouth bass nationwide or bisexual now because the chemicals if you can't admit all the admitted
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  wildness how will you admit the even craziness of we're on a planet in deep space and what the Bible tells us now now expanding whether whether some of this esoteric stuff is actually real or not the globalists believe it's all real every culture believed it they believe
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  in manifesting it macron has been in front of the big black pyramid with the all seeing eyes sworn in will put that on screen for TV viewers in a minute then he says last week I am God declares a dictator ship puts
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  France under civil emergency our media doesn't even make a big deal out of it and says I am the sun god Jupiter I am the sun god Jupiter and I am now a dictator what in the world is going on.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  I have an answer for you there for a long time the demons and a demon is a disembodied spirit that's sent in another words it has understanding have hidden themselves.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  God is ripping if you will this fabric of time and space that separates the physical world from the spiritual world and I believe that that statement is coming from an entity a non human entity that possesses him.
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  Look you go to Matt dredges front page today and what is it exorcism at an all time high people are standing in line because they're dealing with demons when I first started writing about genetic Armageddon Alex and talked about the day would come when machines would not only be built to try and replace
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  mankind but they become inhabited with demons so that the demonic people can deny it all day long until it happens to them in my inbox fills up with literally dozens of people some of the Christians.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  People terrified because of the things they're seeing in the night Jesus said it this way if the salt loses its save saver in other words its ability to be saltiness then we get trampled under the foot of man.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Well that's what's happened. There's no reason anybody who believes in Jesus Christ or as a Christian a Bible believing Christian should ever apologize or think they have to take.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  Here's the proof the globalist everywhere will spend billions of dollars to invade countries just to kill Christians they admit it they have a hunger to destroy and kill and torture children and innocent people.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  This is their hunger this is what drives them universally and that's the proof.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  And universally they are driven away by the spirit of God the spirit of Christ love goodness creativity honor strength and not being a coward.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  Well absolutely and that's what Jesus said suffer the little children to come under me I wish that were not the case but when we wouldn't protect the most innocent now here's why the devil wants their blood.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  The devil absolutely hates innocence he hates God's holiness he hates virtue he hates the fact that for the reason God created mankind originally in his image and likeness that we had something that even he didn't have.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Yet the Bible teaches that the angels became jealous and Alex 99% of your critics and my critics are jealous.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Now if they can fault us on a fact that's a different story but the problem is they're jealous of our freedom.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  They're jealous of our freedom and they're jealous because you know what the bottom line is and you know I like to overuse that statement the bottom line is they know it's true in their heart because the Bible teaches that God has put.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  And they know they're falling and they know they're broken this is Veritas we'll be back.

[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  There is no doubt that mainstream media for decades told folks the Federal Reserve wasn't private. They failed. Now folks know.
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  They tell people that BERT defects aren't up when they are. They tell people that cancer isn't up when it is.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  They tell folks that, again, there isn't massive mutations in fish and wildlife from the very water we're drinking as well.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  They want to suppress it. Their job is to lie to you. And most people even work for the system. They just go along. They want to grovel.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  They want to do what they're told with the talking points to get basically up the ladder.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  But as things start to disintegrate, being part of the system is becoming more and more worthless, more and more anathema, more and more hated.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Again, thank you for joining us. Thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast. They're trying to censor InfoWars.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  They're demonizing us. They're lying about us. They're so scared because of what we're covering and what we're doing.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  That's why when you spread the links to InfoWars.com, when you share the articles, the videos, when you join us in the meme contest at Paul Watson's over,
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  right through next Wednesday, $20,000. That's a lot of money, but these memes are bringing the globalists down.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  It's about getting the people involved, the people politically involved, the people engaged in information warfare.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  We are so close, just like Bill Clinton was a rapist contest.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  Trump has openly said, probably swung the election for him. You swung the election. You're fighting back. You're empowering the restoration of the Republic.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Your hope. They want to drive down our will. They want to demoralize us.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  They go, oh, nobody wants to shake Trump's hand overseas. All made up. He's unpopular. He's a failure. They're the failures. They're the ones falling apart.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  Steve Cuell, I want to get more of the geopolitical North Korea and how this could trigger and what would happen when we come back in a moment.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  But just briefly, what is CNN going to do now that they have the lowest viewers on cable, not just cable news.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  I mean, reruns of Yogi Bear on InfoWars.com. We have articles are higher. They're arrogance. They're idiocy.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  Do they know what failures they are? Or do they hire such evil narcissist that all they care about is being on a stage, on a pedestal, around other vampires?
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  Well, I think it's a vampire, narcissism, mutual admiration society. But look, we're watching them self-destruct, Alex.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  And not only are we watching them self-destruct, but what happens when their food source, the unknowing public, gets smart and no longer listens to them?
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  I think you referred to it. They're going to turn on themselves. They'll use false flags. They'll do everything.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  And also, at the end of the day, their only last tool is to have some form of an EMP.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  I'm not even talking about a missile strike or a space-based weapon. I'm talking specifically about a pre-positioned series of weapons that could take us down, and they don't even need to go there.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  They've only got to hit, what, six points?
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Yeah, six points. And look at all of the databases that have been violated for the record. There is no safe database. Everything is known.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  But they tell you, get up on a cloud knowing it's going to cause the mass hacking.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  Well, absolutely. I think that, you know, societies go crazy in mass, okay? And I think it was Mackie that wrote a book about that. And the herd is always wrong.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Guess what? The herd ended up in the slaughterhouse. So we're telling everybody...
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  The herd runs off the cliff.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  Yeah. And then the demons come in the gathering to Maniac in the New Testament.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  So here's the thing. It's a spiritual battle. It has physical implications. People can no longer be casual spectators.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  And I think the obvious reason why it's all coming right now is that God's drawing a line. He's drawing his line in the sand.
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  He said, all you want Satan, go there. All you that want me, go here.
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  That's why it's clear and clear and clear. And Hollywood says, we want Satan. We want Christians. We hate you. And let us rape your children. We love the devil. We are legion. We are legion. We have your children. We are unstoppable.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  We will overthrow God. We will kill you. We love Islam. We will kill you. We will kill you. No, we will defeat you.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  Tell us about that all of a sudden. There's so many things that are in it.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  There's the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  It is so dangerous, this modern world where they want to make it totally domesticated, where they want to disconnect us from the fields, from the farms, from everything.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  And then Amazon's Bezos admits he wants a global monopoly over everything and then he wants to destroy free speech.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  He wants to destroy America. He's a globalist.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  He gets 600 million from the CIA to fund the Washington Post to lie about our Americana recovery.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  And then I've got a chart here I wanted to show Steve Quayle and everybody else that's watching on television.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  This chart shows how quickly Amazon is eating the retail world.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  And hey, it's great. It's convenient. But once it becomes oligopoly, it's able to even shut down Walmart.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Walmart's imploding because of it.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  This chart shows how quickly Amazon is eating the retail world where you can actually go out and have local shops, local businesses, and communicate with a human.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  It's beyond robots taking over. Now they've bought up Whole Foods and have robots get ready to take control of that.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Here's the chart. Look as retail goes down, Amazon goes up.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  And they're so monopolistic, even online shopping carts like us can't deal with it.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  I mean, they can do shipping for like a dollar. That's why they say it's free to you because of how they've scaled up.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  We have to chart $6, $7 on a heavier object. People want the lower price, so they destroy themselves giving it to a guy worse than George Soros.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  So that's why it's economic warfare. You've got to shop with the mom and pop some.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  They're always going to have some stuff that you're not going to see. Thrift shops, you name it.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  You've got to go to farmers markets, at least some.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  You know, to keep that there, you've got to go to m4warstore.com and a shopping cart that's based here in Texas that actually hires people and that actually gives you good prices.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  In fact, we saw a lot of stuff that's sold on Amazon lower than they do, but we still can't compete with the shipping because they, again, have scaled up so high that no one can compete, including Walmart.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  And then that kills competition. Steve Quill, could you speak to that briefly?
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  Absolutely. I'm calling this whole takeover franken greed, okay? Frankenstein was, you know, obviously the monster created by parts, but now franken greed is taking on a life of its own.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  It doesn't matter if it's in the computer field, doesn't matter in the service sector.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  And what Bezos is doing is total, in my opinion, the total control, it's like the old statement, give me a control of the nation's money and a care not who writes its laws.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  How about this? You'll owe your soul to the company store.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  And now if you put it into, let's say, let's say everything crashes, Alex, except cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever, and people start making all kinds of money, which they are.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  And obviously, I'm not faulting anybody for that. But if you look beyond the obvious astronomical growth and understand that when everything you have is in a crypto or in the cloud, then your butt is in a real trouble on earth.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  Because whoever controls, look, power, everybody can have their wallets. And I'm still, I'm sorry, but I'm a physical commodity guy.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  Exactly. But giving it one centralized global store that's perfect for the market of the beast, it shuts down competition, and then you have to depend on it for everything.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  Absolutely.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  And then it decides more and more Amazon isn't letting patriots have stores, too. Then it can cut you out of the marketplace.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  And they did that on YouTube. Remember, with people that were able to monetize their information?
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  They've already lowered our monetization 78 percent, which we have more views than ever. They're just robbing us now because we're conservative.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  And they lie about all of our placements and everything. Look, everything they say is a lie. You know, the old joke, how do you know when a news, a major newscast is lying when they're opening their mouths?
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  How do you know?
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  Google's been caught everywhere stealing passwords, stealing data, monopoly, scamming. And of course, they don't pay you what you're supposed to. It's all a giant fraud.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  And, you know, I remember this. I said, I did this 15 years ago on talk radio. I said, what we're going to have is assassination algorithms and the mathematical
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  That's right. Let's come back and explain that where they economically squeeze everything out. It's unbelievable. They already have computer programs.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  Hit one button, then a virus goes out and digitally erases your video algorithm, your voice print algorithm. You name it.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  And then doesn't even allow you to buy or sell so you can no longer even communicate through the digital platforms.
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  But when the FBI and the DHS requested access to the materials, we would not give it to them.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  That same presidential candidate was married to an impeached former president who is also a rapist.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  My last president is also involved as he has absconded in his hiding documents involved in an investigation into classified information leaking to the public.
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  I had a tech staffer, processing server, and a federal prosecutor involved with me all die mysteriously in less than a year. I had multiple members of my party arrested for pedophilic activity this year.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  Have I mentioned Trump Russia yet?
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  We're infowars.com. That's the DNC. This is Owen Schreuer.
[2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  Myco ZX is back in after five plus months sold out. Talk about next level probiotic. It's the antifungus, anti yeast, latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  It's been sold out for months, big waiting list, limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  Nobody's got something that's good.
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  Say 30% off of Myco ZX and get the gut health support back when you get it with the biome defense, 50 billion live in each pill.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Probiotic. Myco ZX contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and well-crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with Myco ZX.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Enforcelife.com before it sells out again. 10% off when you choose auto ship.
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have herbal bow and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist for years ago, now it's epidemic.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  Enforcelife.com, Enforcestore.com, or triple A2533139.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotru selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine,
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  Visit Enforcelife.com to order your bottle of Biotru selenium before we sell it again.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  That's Enforcelife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360WIN.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support Enforce. That's Enforcelife.com.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  All right, award-winning documentary filmmaker, best-selling author, Steve Quell is our guest.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  And I'm going to open the phones up after he leaves us at the bottom of the hour, just specifically on the ceasefire deal reached by Trump and Putin about an hour and a half ago.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  This is huge news.
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  Up on infowars.com, big victory for Trump, big victory for our military, not letting ISIS and al-Qaeda take control of Syria, Obama, and the globalist in Hillary.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  Started that civil war six years ago, destroyed Libya, destroyed Syria, destroyed so many other areas, overthrew our allies in Egypt.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  This is a big defeat against the globalist.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  And Trump and Putin have really hit it off.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  We need to work with Russia to defeat radical Islam.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  There are just so many exciting things going on.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  So that's at the bottom of the hour.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  First-time callers on that subject are other things, 800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  We've got some new memes that we've produced that we're going to be airing at the bottom of the hour as well in the whole war against CNN.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  But I've declared CNN dead.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  They're just propping it up right now.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  But even though they know it's dead and has no viewers, but MSGM's turning against it, don't they understand that's the final domino to fall?
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  That's 100-25-99231.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  Now, going back to our guest, Steve Quail.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  Steve, what else is on your radar economically, geopolitically?
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  I know Ron Paul said, Trump thinks he's doing a great job in the economy.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  But too little, too late because of all these countervailing global forces, a lot of the big banks wanting to raise interest rates to try to kill the recovery.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  Again, I want to be positive.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  Part of having a recovery is being positive.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:31.520]  Trump's doing real things to have real industry, real farming, real heavy machinery, that's
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:32.520]  part of that.
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:36.360]  But exuberance with a real economy is good, but I don't think if he doesn't get the tax
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:39.720]  cuts and the rhinos block him, I think they're the biggest threat.
[2:10:39.720 --> 2:10:44.640]  And if we don't get Obamacare repealed, I think this is going to stall by October where
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:45.640]  it traditionally stalls.
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:46.640]  What do you think?
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:51.440]  Well, I agree with you, Alex, and the first thing I would say to the president, and obviously
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:58.480]  you have his ear, and he listens, is Mr. President, you have got to clean out the people that
[2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:04.200]  were placed strategically, even hidden within the major departments under the president.
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:05.920]  And Obama admitted that when he was leaving.
[2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:09.560]  He said, we're putting in a fifth column.
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:10.560]  Absolutely.
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:16.200]  Now, anybody who's pushing for war with Russia, if that's the same line as Hillary, I don't
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:20.560]  care, national security advisors, I don't care who they are, generals, then he's got
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:21.560]  to get rid of them.
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:26.800]  And here's my recommendation to the president of the United States, call back the generals
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:33.760]  that have battlefield experience, reinstate those who had to lead out of conscience, bring
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:39.480]  back the men who will know how to fight because, listen, everybody's teaming up against the
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:40.480]  United States.
[2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:41.480]  I want to make a statement.
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:42.480]  Europe is toast.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.480]  Europe is done.
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:46.360]  I salute Poland and the Czech Republic.
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:51.200]  Wonderful people that put their people's lives first.
[2:11:51.200 --> 2:11:56.400]  And if I were President Trump, I'd sit down with Vladimir Putin and President Trump's
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:12:02.280]  most trusted advisor, the most trusted advisor, not his son-in-law.
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:08.520]  And I would sit and I would take my most trusted friend, whether it's Secretary of State Tillerson
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  or somebody that just has a record, you know, and by the way, Flynn was set up.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:17.480]  And I think General Flynn is an amazing man.
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:23.040]  And the thing that scared the wee-wee out of the traders was the fact that General Flynn
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:24.960]  knew what had to be done.
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:27.160]  And they were scared, Alex, of being shot down.
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:31.040]  Well, Sharon, he helped orchestrate the deal with Russia to block Obama turning Syria over
[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:32.040]  to al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:33.840]  That's why they really added him.
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:34.840]  Absolutely.
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:38.040]  But also, I think people need to understand the big picture.
[2:12:38.040 --> 2:12:41.440]  Years ago, you and I did a couple shows over, I think, two or three years where we talked
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:43.960]  about the Chinese white papers.
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:47.600]  And if everybody thinks back, there was a missile launch off the coast of Catalina.
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  That was a threat.
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:50.520]  They've got satellite killers.
[2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:51.520]  Yep.
[2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:57.760]  And so the thing is, is that we are so behind the eight ball, in my opinion, outside of
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:04.360]  using our ultra-black, and I will say this, our space-based weapons systems that exist.
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:08.920]  If anybody doubts that, they don't know the history of weapons development and that they've
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:13.960]  got to recognize that it is in America's favor to get along with the Russians.
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:15.960]  The Russians are amazing people.
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:19.240]  Now, look, I'm a rabid anti-communist.
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:21.120]  But Russia's not communist anymore.
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:22.120]  It isn't anymore.
[2:13:22.120 --> 2:13:23.120]  But we are.
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:24.120]  We are.
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:25.120]  We are undergoing a Russian...
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:28.600]  Yeah, we've got Atlantic Monthly in Hollywood saying, get rid of Christians.
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:33.000]  The sun is set on America pushing weird anti-white division stuff.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  Just brazen...
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.040]  Imagine if the Russians were saying stuff like that in the old Soviet Union.
[2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:38.040]  This is beyond...
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:41.800]  I mean, this is, like, more rabid than the Soviets, and then they're the ones pointing
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:44.160]  at the Russians because they're the globalist threat.
[2:13:44.160 --> 2:13:47.320]  They're trying to point at another outside threat to make us rally around Hollywood.
[2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:49.440]  I mean, what is wrong with Hollywood?
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:51.360]  Why are they so turned over to pedophilia?
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:52.360]  Who's worse?
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:55.080]  Hollywood or the people that have taken over the Catholic Church?
[2:13:55.080 --> 2:13:56.080]  I would say this.
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:13:57.600]  They're one and the same.
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:01.280]  And when we go all over the world, Alex, my film crews go all over the world.
[2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:05.240]  The cover-up and the cover-over always leads back to the Vatican.
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:08.320]  Now, I am absolutely friends with Catholics.
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:09.320]  I'm not.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:12.120]  There's no anti-Catholic sentiment in my statement.
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:18.960]  But the Vatican, our DVD, You Guys Sell It, The Unholy Sea, covers the exact cover-up.
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:24.600]  Look, when my film crew was in Sardinia, they were monitored by the Vatican helicopters.
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:29.360]  Literally, you'd think it was a scene out of Raiders of the Lost Ark and by the grace
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:31.440]  of God and people praying for their safety.
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:37.920]  I got guys now half the world away and harms away to prove that even there in the middle
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:41.120]  of the jungles, Alex, the control is that deep.
[2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:46.920]  So that mystery missile that ABC carried years ago, look, I had guys in the Defense Department.
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:48.320]  I had missile commanders.
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:49.320]  I had everybody.
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:51.000]  Well, they lied to us and said it wasn't a missile.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:57.280]  They said it was a vapor-trail from the plane when it was clearly a knockoff of a U.S. sea-launched
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:04.640]  submarine-launched ballistic missile, an SLBM, and you know, Gary Haven, you know, pilot,
[2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:12.000]  14, 15,000 hours, you know, Gary's never seen a plane, a jet, act like that, even a fighter
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:13.360]  on full-afterburners.
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:16.920]  I had guys tell me they did the spectral analysis in real time.
[2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:22.720]  In other words, they were able to blast the plume, the fuel plume, and get an instantaneous
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:23.720]  reading.
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:26.480]  Sure, they were hit with heat-seeking monitors.
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:27.480]  You've got it.
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:30.520]  But not only that, they knew exactly which country it came from.
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:33.120]  Because they know the signature of the missile.
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:34.120]  Yep.
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:38.440]  And so every missile, the propulsion system, the signature, the telemetry, just like North
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:44.080]  Korea, who has the most to gain to be lying to us about what North Korea achieved?
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:46.680]  Because then it goes right back to who provided them the technology.
[2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:48.480]  Let me ask you that question since you raised it.
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:49.840]  I've got the article right here.
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:50.840]  Mainstream news.
[2:15:50.840 --> 2:15:55.600]  Bill Clinton paved the way for nuclear Korea, gave them the reactors that could make the
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:59.880]  fissile material, helped China get their long-range ICBM technology.
[2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:02.400]  Just in the 90s, most of their missiles blew up.
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:04.600]  So now China's clearly given that to them.
[2:16:04.600 --> 2:16:05.600]  Why?
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:06.600]  Why?
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:07.600]  Why?
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:13.200]  Well, because at heart, he's a globalist, he's obviously a solid Linskyite.
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:16.200]  And all people have to do to question, if they're questioning you on that statement.
[2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:17.200]  They love death.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:18.200]  They love destruction.
[2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:19.200]  They love directlessness.
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:20.200]  They love death.
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:22.240]  The evil of giving a pure evil regime nuclear weapons.
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:25.880]  That is a great satanic move to do.
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:28.160]  It's just, it's a bad, horrible thing.
[2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:29.160]  So they do it.
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:30.160]  Right.
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:34.080]  And L'Oreal Satellite Corporation, and this was told to me by a four-star actor.
[2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:35.080]  And Hughes.
[2:16:35.080 --> 2:16:36.080]  It came out L'Oreal and Hughes.
[2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:37.080]  Both were allowed to do it.
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:38.080]  Go ahead.
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:39.080]  Yep.
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:40.080]  Yep.
[2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:41.080]  But listen, Alex.
[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  One, I asked the general this specific question.
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:45.720]  I said, General N, do they have everything?
[2:16:45.720 --> 2:16:49.760]  And he said, Steve, they have everything.
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:51.640]  And I said, even ultra black?
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:55.800]  He said, there's some they don't have, but that's what they're working on stealing the
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:16:56.800]  most.
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:16:57.800]  Now, again, you and I carried the story.
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:16:58.800]  I didn't finish it.
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:00.320]  The white papers.
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:06.280]  What most people in the West don't understand is that the Chinese are on record as saying,
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:10.560]  if for their manifest destiny, if 300 million Americans die.
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:12.240]  That goes back to the 60s and 70s.
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:13.240]  They say.
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:14.240]  You got it.
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:15.240]  And so, Alex.
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:16.240]  They're willing to kill all of us, even if we kill half of them.
[2:17:16.240 --> 2:17:18.120]  They say they have an overpopulation problem.
[2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:19.120]  Absolutely.
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:24.760]  And so the idea of killing innocent people in Korea, we're talking about an initiation
[2:17:24.760 --> 2:17:26.480]  of global nuclear war.
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:28.480]  I think what President Trump just did.
[2:17:28.480 --> 2:17:33.280]  And by the way, Alex, if you can get a Lavrov on, he speaks really good English.
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:40.240]  In my opinion, OK, he's one of the smartest men in the world who has the most common sense.
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:44.360]  And he's been trying to make a deal with the United States against China and against radical
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:47.800]  Islam, which is the normal smart move to make.
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:49.160]  And can you get him on?
[2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:52.000]  Because again, I would say this, that he is.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.560]  They don't want people like that to don't create a huge controversy.
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:59.440]  One time, I've been invited to go over Russia and RT things and I've been invited.
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:01.920]  They said I could probably interview Putin if I wanted to, but it'd be about hunting
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:02.920]  and fishing.
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:04.200]  That was a few years ago.
[2:18:04.200 --> 2:18:07.160]  And I just, I just, the optics of me going over to Russia, because, you know, I mean,
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:10.120]  it's not that I'm afraid of it, but they'll say I'm over there getting my orders or whatever.
[2:18:10.120 --> 2:18:11.120]  But I'm right.
[2:18:11.120 --> 2:18:12.120]  Right.
[2:18:12.120 --> 2:18:14.120]  Because I mean, I'm tempted to go just because they keep saying it.
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:17.040]  But you know, we should try to get somebody like Lavrov on.
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:19.840]  The way I can do it is I could go to a press conference and asking questions.
[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:22.000]  I know for a fact I can do that right now.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:26.560]  I think, I think that even beyond that, I think that you should make an outreach.
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:30.960]  Now, again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not trying to tell Alex Jones what to do, but
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:35.280]  I have followed Russian and I mean this, the Russian thoughts.
[2:18:35.280 --> 2:18:39.760]  And I've dealt with some amazing Russian people at one point.
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:44.720]  They were our enemies at this point that we have to see them as if Putin is standing
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:50.600]  up for the people of Russia and telling the American citizens, don't give up your guns.
[2:18:50.600 --> 2:18:54.440]  Then he's talking about freedom and they're becoming Christian.
[2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:56.360]  They're paying people to get married and have kids.
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:18:57.360]  Absolutely.
[2:18:57.360 --> 2:18:58.360]  They're going the opposite.
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:00.720]  And I've watched some of their stuff, you know, in Russian translated English where
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:04.440]  they're teaching about that they poison the vaccines, it's world government.
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:08.840]  I mean, it's basically the truth is, I don't want to brag, but our whole liberty movement
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:13.320]  basically the Russians believe it because they lived under the Soviet system.
[2:19:13.320 --> 2:19:14.320]  They know it's true.
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:18.760]  And much of what we've covered, the Russians have actually picked up and vice versa.
[2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:19.760]  Absolutely.
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:20.760]  Absolutely.
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:26.240]  And by the way, I think RT and RU are both sending film crews into Bozeman.
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:28.560]  They want to interview myself and Timothy Albarino.
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:34.400]  They want to interview us on the coverup of ancient civilizations and why that all these
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:39.240]  people that are into Satanism and everything worship the deities and the gods, getting
[2:19:39.240 --> 2:19:40.600]  back to Macron.
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:47.840]  If that doesn't scare the full bladder and the full body, saying he's God, and I want
[2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:48.840]  to put this into perspective.
[2:19:48.840 --> 2:19:49.840]  Well, stay there.
[2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:50.840]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[2:19:50.840 --> 2:19:51.840]  Final second was Steve Quell.
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:52.840]  Then your phone calls.
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:55.960]  I'll play some of the Trump-Putin interaction that was public as well.
[2:19:55.960 --> 2:19:56.960]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:19:57.960]  InfoWars.com.

[2:19:59.280 --> 2:20:04.600]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[2:20:04.600 --> 2:20:08.240]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and
[2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:12.760]  vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:20:12.760 --> 2:20:15.800]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:20:15.800 --> 2:20:19.600]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[2:20:19.600 --> 2:20:22.440]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[2:20:22.440 --> 2:20:26.600]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.

[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:07.760]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[2:23:29.400 --> 2:23:30.400]  healthier I feel.

[2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:08.960]  It seems like yesterday, but it was long ago, that first has Team Quell on now 22 years
[2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:09.960]  ago.
[2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:23.600]  That's right, I was looking at the calendar last night and I got on air in April of 1995,
[2:24:23.600 --> 2:24:29.040]  so how many years ago, 21, 22 years ago, you know, that's 22 years ago, and when my first
[2:24:29.040 --> 2:24:33.680]  guest was Steve Quell and I heard, I thought, this guy is just wild and about 90% of it's
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:34.680]  come true.
[2:24:34.680 --> 2:24:38.680]  Steve Quell, we're carrying, what is it, all four of his new films, we've got The Holy
[2:24:38.680 --> 2:24:43.400]  Sea, that really exposes how the Satanists have taken over the Vatican, we're not anti-gatholic,
[2:24:43.400 --> 2:24:52.320]  it's just a fact, The Unholy Sea, available at infowarstore.com, or by calling 888-253-3139,
[2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:57.240]  and by the way, it's free shipping, store-wide on everything, we're doing that for the month
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:25:04.640]  of July, infowarstore.com, or 888-253-3139, certainly thought-provoking information.
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:09.440]  Now, we were getting into Macron before I went to break in other issues, if you just
[2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:16.680]  joined us, he did say on Wednesday that he is the God-Emperor, Jupiter, and did declare
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:21.880]  emergency powers, basically martial law, over France, and he just walks around totally
[2:25:21.880 --> 2:25:25.360]  crazed like he's God, he is a total mental patient.
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:28.240]  I've had this happen to a few people I've known in my life where they just decide they're
[2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:32.920]  just invincible, it's like a form of make-believe, it's a possession, I don't know what you call
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:33.920]  it.
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.140]  The more I get, the more humble I get, I don't understand people that petty folks get a little
[2:25:38.140 --> 2:25:40.760]  bit of power, like a McDonald's manager or something.
[2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:46.200]  This guy is just a nobody, a total puppet, he comes into the line today, tries to, comes
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:51.960]  down from where he's at to get beside Trump, so that, you know, he can look all powerful.
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:57.080]  Again, what is the disease in people's minds like this from your research, Steve Quill?
[2:25:57.080 --> 2:26:02.600]  Well, I think the picture you're showing right now, look at him biting his lip, Alex.
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:06.120]  Watch Obama when he's lying, watch Paul Ryan when he's lying.
[2:26:06.120 --> 2:26:11.680]  I believe that's a signature of their conditioning, i.e., or their cloning.
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:14.480]  You know how many people won't accept that?
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:19.480]  Now look at his eyes, the Bible says his eyes are the windows to his soul.
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:24.080]  Look at the lip furl, I don't know how to describe his lips, but watch for that, ladies
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:25.080]  and gentlemen.
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:30.360]  Alex, you said it, you said it, even we're mocked by the entity in the White House.
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:35.840]  Some people prefer to him as the former president, I refer to him as the entity.
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:41.720]  So while we're watching this taking, again, let me share a word, out-picturing.
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:47.880]  You're going to see, ladies and gentlemen, not erratic behavior, but that which possesses
[2:26:47.880 --> 2:26:53.920]  these men, these women, you're going to see them showing their true nature.
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:57.160]  And God is stripping off the veneer.
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:00.800]  The entity is absolutely revealing to let people see.
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.840]  By giving them rope, letting them think they're invincible, their mental illness is coming
[2:27:03.840 --> 2:27:04.840]  out.
[2:27:04.840 --> 2:27:05.840]  What was the term you used earlier?
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:10.000]  You got cut off by break about assassination algorithms.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:11.240]  Assassination algorithms.
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:14.800]  The illuminous, the globalist control all the world's data banks.
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:19.760]  They control every single, quote, secure server in the world.
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:24.960]  They have advanced mathematics, now here's the word that people won't recognize until
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:26.440]  they begin to see it.
[2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.840]  But they have a supernatural oversight.
[2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:35.040]  Alex, the basic point I'm at in my life now, and you guys are carrying the book Xenogenesis.
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:41.320]  I believe that's the most important book that I have written to tell people what lies ahead.
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:46.160]  And again, the latest documentary which you carry is the Holocaust of Giants.
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:50.360]  What I'm saying to you, the giants were the offspring of the fallen angels in antiquity
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:51.760]  and history.
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:56.560]  And their fathers, the fallen angels, I believe that's who the unseen.
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:27:59.280]  Certainly the Bible says that, other folks say that those are metaphors.
[2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:03.640]  I don't even get into all that stuff, but I know the elites are obsessed with it, and
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:08.360]  now Macron is saying he's God, and now we have drones that are out there killing people
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:10.640]  autonomously by algorithm.
[2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:11.640]  That is so dangerous.
[2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:15.680]  That's directly out of Skynet, which we know is art imitating life, because we know under
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:21.360]  space command for the 1970s, the code words for it is Skynet.
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:22.360]  Absolutely.
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:28.320]  And to get people to understand the Terminator series, which you know on the CIA was involved
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:29.320]  in.
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:30.320]  Absolutely.
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:31.320]  Well, let me share this.
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:34.840]  The CIA is involved in every single sci-fi.
[2:28:34.840 --> 2:28:37.760]  Gene Roddenberry was a CIA asset.
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:38.760]  Okay.
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:40.360]  Obviously, people don't recognize.
[2:28:40.360 --> 2:28:44.640]  So why are so many folks, formerly with the CIA, some of which I talked to that know you
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:48.640]  from out in Colorado, you know, coming out with all this info now, are they breaking
[2:28:48.640 --> 2:28:53.920]  with the program or is this part of a larger existential of the hierarchy?
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:28:59.000]  No, I think they're breaking with the program because Alex, they're seeing the reality of
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  hell.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:03.520]  They're seeing it in hot and I call Hollywood, Hollywood.
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:06.440]  They've bewitched the world, Hollywood, the witches ones.
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:07.920]  The witches are cursing Trump.
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:11.920]  That's why Christians have got to be praying for his safety, his family's safety.
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:15.760]  And by the way, when you and I were on a show together years ago, when they were gonna launch
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:20.080]  the phony Ebola thing, if you remember that show, I said, shot in the arm, shot in the
[2:29:20.080 --> 2:29:22.000]  head, either way, you end up dead.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:26.920]  So we have got and this thing, the attack on white Christian America.
[2:29:26.920 --> 2:29:27.920]  What is that?
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:28.920]  Right out of the mouthpiece.
[2:29:28.920 --> 2:29:31.040]  And then they say, we're racist to say that.
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:34.880]  They're the ones saying white people, get white people, get Christians.
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:35.880]  This is insane.
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:36.880]  Thank you, Steve Quill.
[2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:37.880]  Very powerful.
[2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:39.480]  Your film's available in fullwarstore.com.
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:40.480]  Very, very thought-provoking.
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:43.080]  You're dead on from my research, geopolitically.
[2:29:43.080 --> 2:29:44.080]  Thank you so much.
[2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:46.080]  I know I questioned some of the other stuff, but it's all interesting.
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:47.680]  And hey, it's free speech in America.
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:48.680]  Thank you so much.
[2:29:48.680 --> 2:29:49.680]  Always intriguing, Steve Quill.
[2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:50.680]  We're on the march.
[2:29:50.680 --> 2:30:00.920]  The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.920 --> 2:30:06.720]  After a series of embarrassments and scandals, CNN is in full blown crisis mode, with the
[2:30:06.720 --> 2:30:12.640]  network now attracting fewer viewers for its prime time shows than multi-decade old reruns
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:18.680]  of Yogi Bear, with the Trump-Russia collusion story fading into the background, an issue
[2:30:18.680 --> 2:30:23.920]  that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings despite knowing it was fake news.
[2:30:23.920 --> 2:30:29.000]  The network's ratings are now plummeting, and there's no doubt that CNN's most recent
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:35.360]  scandal that sparked hashtag CNN Blackmail has played a role after CNN threatened to dox
[2:30:35.360 --> 2:30:39.680]  some random gift creator that President Trump happened to retweet.
[2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:45.840]  To put things into perspective, the CNN app now has only one star out of five in the Apple
[2:30:45.840 --> 2:30:51.560]  App Store, where comparably the Fox News app has three and a half stars, whereas the Info
[2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:56.200]  Wars and Alex Jones' radio app have both four and a half stars.
[2:30:56.200 --> 2:31:00.280]  I'm Milla Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:02.160]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[2:31:02.160 --> 2:31:04.160]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[2:31:04.160 --> 2:31:07.040]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:13.120]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[2:31:13.120 --> 2:31:18.040]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:23.000]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:27.840]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, through the best
[2:31:27.840 --> 2:31:29.840]  job you can to purify your air.
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:34.880]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[2:31:34.880 --> 2:31:37.880]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:40.080]  The general public doesn't.
[2:31:40.080 --> 2:31:44.040]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:31:44.040 --> 2:31:47.640]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:31:47.640 --> 2:31:51.200]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[2:31:51.200 --> 2:31:54.400]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:54.400 --> 2:32:01.520]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:32:01.520 --> 2:32:05.440]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[2:32:05.440 --> 2:32:06.880]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:07.880]  I take this.
[2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:08.880]  My family takes this.
[2:32:08.880 --> 2:32:12.560]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going
[2:32:12.560 --> 2:32:13.560]  to find anywhere.
[2:32:13.560 --> 2:32:17.840]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[2:32:17.840 --> 2:32:22.440]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:23.600]  I don't feel good.
[2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:27.320]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[2:32:27.320 --> 2:32:30.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my super female.
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:36.120]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:38.880]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:42.400]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:44.560]  So obviously the super female is amazing.
[2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:45.560]  I love it.
[2:32:45.560 --> 2:32:48.240]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:49.240]  Survival Shield X2.
[2:32:49.240 --> 2:32:52.600]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[2:32:52.600 --> 2:32:54.600]  iodine Survival Shield X2.
[2:32:54.600 --> 2:32:56.840]  It's got a five star rating.
[2:32:56.840 --> 2:33:06.040]  So win-win, InfoWarsLive.com.
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:14.520]  Waging war on corruption, broadcasting worldwide into your mind.
[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:21.120]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[2:33:21.120 --> 2:33:23.480]  GCN radio network.
[2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:26.280]  Do not attempt to adjust your dial.
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:29.720]  We are in control.
[2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:33.440]  We are allowed to look at WikiLeaks, but not you.
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:36.560]  We are allowed to do the thinking, but not you.
[2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:46.600]  We are CNN, the Communist News Network, the Coward News Network, the Cancer News Network.
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:55.120]  I kind of like that classical music.
[2:33:55.120 --> 2:34:05.360]  My dad was a cool guy, and he was a guy from Texas, but he still listened to classical
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:11.360]  music, and so I remember him coming to get me out of bed at like 4 a.m. to get ready
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:15.960]  and go out and drive around and mess with the cows and stuff, and he'd be in there drinking
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:21.960]  his coffee, listening to classical music, and then we'd be riding along with a little
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:22.960]  transistor radio.
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:28.640]  It was like a red radio, it was sold, it was like pink, like something from the 50s.
[2:34:28.640 --> 2:34:33.880]  He'd had this playing with music out of Dallas, you know, hundreds of miles away, just cool
[2:34:33.880 --> 2:34:37.440]  drive around to the woods and looking at the cows and checking the fences and feeding the
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:42.000]  cows while classical music played.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:45.280]  Just popped in my head, listen to that piece of music.
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:46.280]  Memory's so good sometimes.
[2:34:46.280 --> 2:34:48.360]  I think I even listened to this song with him.
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:53.160]  I'm not enough of a buff on classical music to know who that is.
[2:34:53.160 --> 2:34:55.520]  Is that Night on Bald Mountain, I think?
[2:34:55.520 --> 2:34:57.880]  Is that Night on Bald Mountain?
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:00.440]  It is Night on Bald Mountain.
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:04.760]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:08.360]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:35:08.360 --> 2:35:10.920]  Here's the bottom line.
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:16.720]  They are scared of us creating our own economies, and I was always somebody who was pro-free
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:21.560]  market, but as a Christian, I could see how the left manipulated people because I was
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:24.400]  almost ashamed to try to make a bunch of money for myself.
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:29.400]  I mean, after I had a good car working and a decent house, I didn't want more.
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:32.440]  In fact, more is kind of a hassle, but then they tried to shut me down about 11 years
[2:35:32.440 --> 2:35:36.000]  ago, came after me, said I was just trying to make money all over the news.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  I said, you know what?
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  I'm going to show you make money.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:39.480]  I'm going to show you what we're going to do.
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:42.760]  Well, we've gotten to a level now where we go to the next level, there's not much higher
[2:35:42.760 --> 2:35:44.800]  to go in the fight against these people.
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:50.360]  And I'm not doing it for my name, I'm not doing it for my ego, I'm doing it to survive
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:53.600]  for myself, my family, and your family, because believe me, if they can destroy us, they're
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:55.280]  going to bring the whole thing down.
[2:35:55.280 --> 2:36:05.000]  Our destinies are now intertwined right now, and we've allowed ourselves to be born into
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:06.760]  this high-tech society.
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:09.920]  We've been eased into it, but now we're waking up to the fact it's a trap.
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:13.320]  Not the technology's bad, one of your calls in a moment, but that the globalists have
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:19.720]  designed it and twisted it with Trojan horses and systems of oppression.
[2:36:19.720 --> 2:36:25.360]  And so we now, with our choices and our dollars and our movements and our actions, bend it
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:32.400]  back towards the light and back towards good intention, good will, not bad will.
[2:36:32.400 --> 2:36:39.360]  Google throws party in D.C. for digital Democrats to roam Corsi, infowars.com.
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:43.440]  And what did Schmidt just announce last week, I saw the headline, three million to gun control
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:44.440]  groups.
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:48.640]  I mean, every day or two, it's 10 million here, 3 million there, 5 million there.
[2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:55.840]  And that's just from Schmidt, not the top 300 or so Google heirs who are almost all
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:01.360]  globalist social engineers with Intutel, the CIA, 17 years ago that literally founded
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:06.600]  it with NSA software to not be a search engine, but to be a mass tracking system of you and
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:10.280]  your family.
[2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:15.320]  Google is a breakaway civilization and he just wants your guns because he's worried
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:19.960]  that there might be a rebellion against the technocratic takeover at once you realize it's
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:24.160]  forced inoculations for all.
[2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:28.480]  It's the orderly control of the phase out of 90% of the population.
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:38.240]  So just remember that, that's why I talked about Bezos and how something like 80% of
[2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:42.760]  the retail sales have been killed by Amazon, that's killing diversity, it's killing choice.
[2:37:42.760 --> 2:37:46.720]  And then you're going to see just like a Walmart, once they've killed all the jobs for 50 miles
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:49.840]  around, they're going to jack the prices up.
[2:37:49.840 --> 2:37:54.440]  That's why it's imperative to support independent shopping carts, like I know how easy Amazon
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:38:00.000]  is and I'd sit there every few days and see a couple of Amazon packages for food or medicine
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.240]  or what I'm just saying, hey, everybody stop being lazy, I want you to go out to mom and
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:09.040]  pop shops and I don't care if it's a couple of dollars more because it scaled up the Amazon,
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:15.080]  buy it there, told the wife that, told the nanny that that helps out, myself that, I'm
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:19.440]  just like, and I'll even support, you know, bigger companies or whatever, but I know look
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:22.440]  at what their politics are and if they're on the board of gun control groups or they're
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:27.920]  on the board of the fellow reserve, like the, you know, Chibani owner or whatever, I'm not
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:33.440]  doing business with them because they're monopolistic, they're coming after our freedoms, we're done.
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:38.800]  And it doesn't mean I'm perfect, but now because the internet being so accessible, we can use
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:43.080]  it against them, I go and I check everything I buy, everything I do.
[2:38:43.080 --> 2:38:47.240]  I was in a store the other day, my son had outgrown his exercise clothes and he wanted
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:51.440]  some Patagonia clothes, which are nice jackets, nice camping stuff.
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:55.160]  And I went, no, the owner of that is sworn to communism, sworn to bringing down America
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:39:00.120]  and SJW, anti-police, not the police are perfect, but I'm, you know, not George Soros,
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:04.960]  let's overthrow him so he can run things and no, no, no, no, no, no, thank you.
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:08.120]  And I said, sorry, in fact, I said, son, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:11.120]  I said, I actually have a Patagonia jacket.
[2:39:11.120 --> 2:39:16.040]  When I got home, I threw it in the trash and I took a butcher knife and I stabbed a big
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:19.640]  hole in it so nobody could take it out of the trash and wear it because wearing that is
[2:39:19.640 --> 2:39:23.600]  a billboard for evil.
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:34.880]  We've got a new shirt and that is the CNN is fake news, black and white on the right
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:38.720]  hand arm info wars.com on the back info wars is real news.
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:43.120]  It's nice, soft fabric, it's 1995.
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:46.400]  The shirt's so nice it causes like 10 bucks a piece on the bigger ones even more.
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:47.800]  I mean, it's real soft fabric, really nice.
[2:39:47.800 --> 2:39:53.000]  This is my, this is the shirt I wear at home now also have another group of shirts I took
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  home.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:57.960]  That's what I wear at home and what I wear when I work out and that is my free speech
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:02.200]  doesn't have when you're offended info wars.com on the back info wars.com on the right chest
[2:40:02.200 --> 2:40:09.240]  and on the right shoulder, George Washington on a black shield with olive branches around
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:11.680]  him symbolizing victory.
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:15.760]  And I believe that is the best shirt, quite frankly, and it's not even one of our best
[2:40:15.760 --> 2:40:18.000]  sellers.
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  It is now that I'm plugging it.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  I mean, that's a shirt I've been wearing for years.
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:22.520]  I'm like, why haven't I done an ad for this?
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:25.200]  So those shirts are available, but it's about getting the word out.
[2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:27.160]  It's about meeting like minded people.
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:31.240]  And it's also about normally we can't do free shipping.
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:34.560]  We lose a lot of money when we do it, but folks like it so much I'm doing this month.
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:35.560]  That's where we can't compete.
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:38.200]  I mean, we're about to start selling organic, colloidal silver mouthwash.
[2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:42.400]  Well, I mean, it's going to cost us at the cheapest shipping place we can find if it's
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.800]  a priority mail $7 a deal.
[2:40:45.800 --> 2:40:49.760]  I know for a fact, Amazon will give you free because they're such a massive conglomerate
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:52.880]  they've scaled up where you can't compete with it.
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:55.440]  So this stuff comes in and we're starting selling it next week.
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:59.040]  It actually came in and I'm in there with the folks are like, Alex, you can't offer
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:00.040]  free shipping on this.
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:05.800]  You want to do, you know, all week until the end of the month, we just can't do it on
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:07.920]  this item or we'll lose money.
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.440]  This mouthwash is so good, it's costing us $10.
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:17.440]  It's concentrate, colloidal silver, fluoride free, all of it goes with super blue.
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:20.880]  We've already got one in this organic mouthwash, 10 to one concentrate.
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  It's great.
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:23.200]  The new one has a little silver coming in.
[2:41:23.200 --> 2:41:28.640]  It's a bigger bottle and it's just, that's how good our deals are is that if I give you
[2:41:28.640 --> 2:41:33.760]  free shipping on the new mouthwash coming in, we will lose money.
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:37.560]  That's how good these deals are DNA forces back in 20% off.
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:42.960]  Anything else is 30 to 40% off infowarstore.com, but it takes volume of purchase to fund it.
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:49.440]  And I am looking to not take any profit this year show that I can personally get and we're
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:50.440]  trying.
[2:41:50.440 --> 2:41:53.320]  Oh, by the way, let me make this announcement now that I'm going to your calls.
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:54.920]  We need female reporters.
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:58.320]  Leigh Ann still works here, but her grandmother had to have emergency brain surgery.
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:41:59.320]  She loves her.
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:00.320]  She's been there taking care of her.
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:03.360]  She's going to be back in the fall, but she's going to be back and forth between here and
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:04.360]  her grandmothers in Florida.
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:05.360]  And we've got Millie.
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:06.360]  We were does a great job.
[2:42:06.360 --> 2:42:09.080]  Uh, we, I mean, I just like female reporters.
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:11.080]  They've got a great perspective.
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:13.280]  Send it in at jobs at info wars.com.
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:18.360]  If you've worked at mainstream news, alternative news, or you're a writer, you don't look like
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:19.360]  Marilyn Monroe either.
[2:42:19.360 --> 2:42:21.240]  You, you were not like Fox news.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:25.360]  If, if you've got the smarts, the looks too on top of whatever, we just want female reporters
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:31.240]  both in the field, auxiliary reporters, part-time reporters, but you know, send in your real
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:32.520]  show us what you've done.
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:33.520]  Never done it before.
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:34.520]  Go out and shoot a report.
[2:42:34.520 --> 2:42:35.600]  Show us what you can do.
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:37.920]  We want male reporters as well.
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:41.600]  And we're, we're trying to hire like 10 more people and some managers who can also then
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:44.080]  do contest and go through all the resumes.
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:48.680]  I mean, we've got to work 18 hours a day just to hire new people.
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:52.240]  You know, I kind of, I need to get, just one person that schedules travel, so it's not
[2:42:52.240 --> 2:42:53.680]  Rob do the news director doing it.
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:56.800]  We're kind of at that point of growth where we've got to, we've got to get bigger to get,
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:42:58.440]  just get more done.
[2:42:58.440 --> 2:43:01.120]  We need the financial support and it makes it a lot easier.
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:04.920]  So I'm not sitting here haggling with folks to move them and their families here to be
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:08.880]  at the importers, new center in Texas and trying to folks to leave Atlanta or New York
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:10.520]  or LA or wherever and to come here.
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:13.800]  It's not as hard now because the exit is out of New York and LA and Florida.
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:15.880]  I'm not bashing Florida, but it's happening.
[2:43:15.880 --> 2:43:17.840]  The point is we're about to really grow.
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:22.320]  I'm going to spend everything extra we've got this year because the critical time we're
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:25.080]  in, but please commit, sign up for auto ships.
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:27.520]  You don't forget to support us each month to get the DNA force.
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:30.560]  Even stuff that sells out doesn't when you do that because we hold enough back for your
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:36.600]  auto ship or the X2 or the, you know, the great brain, a new tropic brain force, 30%
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:41.480]  off, 20% more each bottle infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three,
[2:43:41.480 --> 2:43:42.480]  one, three, nine.
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:43.480]  Okay.
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:50.640]  We're going to go to Zach, Darren, Carlos, Kristen, Jim and others and I've got a bunch
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:51.640]  of other news.
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:52.640]  I haven't hit yet.
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:53.640]  Let me hit this one of them.
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:54.640]  I'll go to your calls.
[2:43:54.640 --> 2:43:58.200]  Labroth says Trump pushed Putin on election hacking.
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:01.920]  A Russian foreign minister played down the issue, but the fact that Putin regime mentioned
[2:44:01.920 --> 2:44:02.920]  it is significant.
[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:07.040]  Following the meeting between President Trump and Putin, Russian foreign minister Sergey
[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:11.480]  Lavrov mentioned the press commerce that Trump brought up Russia interference in 2016
[2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:12.480]  U.S. presidential election.
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:14.960]  Lavrov played down the significance of the segment.
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:20.480]  Quote, President Trump said the U.S. President Trump said in the U.S. there are still some
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:25.000]  circles who were talking about the Russian alleged intrusion and Russian alleged attempt
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:26.400]  to influence the U.S. elections.
[2:44:26.400 --> 2:44:30.080]  Lavrov said, according to Secretary of State, Taylor said it was the first topic that the
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:32.400]  president raised in the meeting.
[2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:33.400]  Okay.
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:35.000]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Let me see.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  Zach.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  Let's talk about the ceasefire.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  So does Darren.
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  So does Carlos.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  So does Kristen.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:50.480]  Jim, let's talk about human chimeris, which again, why do I keep hammering human chimeris?
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:56.600]  They've had them for 30 plus years.
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:45:02.000]  It's in the medical literature and they're not showing the public and they've got rights
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.200]  and it's dangerous.
[2:45:04.200 --> 2:45:09.560]  And I just love how as it all comes out though, I'm still the discredited one with my audience
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:13.520]  for us forcing it out, you forcing it out, getting made fun of at the dinner table.
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:15.760]  Now it's in the news and we're coo kier than ever.
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:19.760]  It's like if some old guy said, son, you won't go over and fish at the other corner of that
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:22.480]  island right there at that point where the river comes out, that's where you'll catch
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:23.480]  the biggest fish.
[2:45:23.480 --> 2:45:26.320]  You go over there, you suddenly catch 10 times the fish.
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:30.160]  You see the old guy and you say, man, let me buy you a beer, let me buy you a breakfast
[2:45:30.160 --> 2:45:32.400]  taco or whatever there is, a little shack down the beach.
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:36.440]  Instead of be like, you old man, and just punch him around the nose, how dare you send
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:40.440]  me where I caught my limit.
[2:45:40.440 --> 2:45:41.440]  But it doesn't matter.
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:42.640]  We just keep doing the right thing.
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:43.640]  Let's see.
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:46.400]  A lot of them, the sheeple doesn't want to be proven wrong.
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:47.920]  They don't want to be shown the light.
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:49.920]  They're trying to help them.
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:54.840]  They think you're showing off because they're so self-centered, they think somebody taking
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:46:01.120]  time out to talk to them is showing off.
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:05.840]  No, if you live in the same world as me and you're dumbed down and you're wrong and you're
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:10.000]  being conned and you're being injected every year with cancer, virus filled flu shots,
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:15.200]  and I've got all the literature, it doesn't matter if talk show hosts make fun of me and
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:19.320]  say Jones is insane and says much of polio came from polio.
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:23.120]  It was in the newspapers in the 50s that a lot of people got polio from the vaccine.
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:26.880]  It was in the newspapers in the 70s and 80s that they banned it, the liquid polio vaccine
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:30.320]  because it was live and was actually giving people polio.
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:35.560]  That's a medical fact that much of the global new paralyzation you see is caused by polio
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:36.560]  vaccines.
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:38.680]  It doesn't mean that polio virus didn't exist.
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:42.240]  It doesn't mean the point is there's been secret experimentation and much of the disease
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:43.480]  has been spread.
[2:46:43.480 --> 2:46:45.240]  Disease didn't get rid of much of the disease.
[2:46:45.240 --> 2:46:47.760]  Running water and hygiene did in the 20s and 30s.
[2:46:47.760 --> 2:46:50.040]  The graphs are all from Australia to Europe, the U.S.
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:52.120]  Let me show TV viewers that I'm going to your calls.
[2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  They're like this.
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:56.720]  Here's the disease up here in 1900 in the Western world.
[2:46:56.720 --> 2:46:58.680]  It's the same graph all over the world.
[2:46:58.680 --> 2:46:59.680]  You can pull these up.
[2:46:59.680 --> 2:47:02.080]  Disease graphs in the industrial world.
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:04.920]  1900, it's up here.
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:11.660]  Indoor water, sanitation, disinfection, more sophisticated detergents, clothes washing.
[2:47:11.660 --> 2:47:14.240]  It goes just like this.
[2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:21.840]  And then in the 1940s, vaccines become massively ubiquitous and it goes like this.
[2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:25.160]  That's the graph right there, depending on the area of the world.
[2:47:25.160 --> 2:47:26.160]  Some of them vary.
[2:47:26.160 --> 2:47:30.640]  They do different stuff, but that's the graph because it's scientific.
[2:47:30.640 --> 2:47:33.880]  It's deliberate.
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:38.240]  Infant mortality went like this, is now bouncing back up.
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:45.040]  I'm just so sick of all these pseudo-intellectuals because I don't talk in a British accent.
[2:47:45.040 --> 2:47:46.040]  I love the Brits.
[2:47:46.040 --> 2:47:48.760]  Or I don't talk in a California accent and I'm not smart.
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:50.280]  I have done the research.
[2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:52.200]  I know what I'm talking about.
[2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:54.480]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:59.400]  Let's go to, not talking to the general audience, but those that are still in denial.
[2:47:59.400 --> 2:48:04.440]  Let's go to Kristen in the great state of Tennessee.
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:05.440]  What is that?
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:06.440]  The volunteer state.
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:07.440]  Go ahead, Kristen.
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:08.440]  Hello.
[2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:09.440]  Hi.
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:10.440]  Hi, welcome.
[2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  Hi.
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:12.440]  You remember me?
[2:48:12.440 --> 2:48:15.520]  The one that talked about the Federal Reserve and my dad, Chairman of the Singapore Stock
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:16.520]  Exchange?
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:19.360]  I don't remember your call exactly, but go ahead, ma'am.
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:20.360]  Sorry.
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:21.360]  Yeah.
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:22.360]  We got 79,000 views.
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  Anyway.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:24.360]  Oh, wow.
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:25.360]  I mean, so fill me in.
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:26.360]  Interest rates hikes?
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:27.360]  Hello?
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:28.360]  Yeah.
[2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:33.760]  I don't really remember all that, but go ahead and speak on air with us.
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:39.040]  Anyway, so basically, I wanted to comment about what the man was saying earlier.
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:44.080]  Yes, the Vatican has a holding company, which is a globalist.
[2:48:44.080 --> 2:48:50.400]  The globalists have their holding company, which is basically the Federal Reserve, and
[2:48:50.400 --> 2:48:55.320]  the Federal Reserve has their hitman, which is basically the IRS.
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:56.320]  That's right.
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:49:02.080]  The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates already twice, and it's going to raise the
[2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:06.280]  interest rates on Trump one more time at the end of the year, and another three interest
[2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:08.160]  rates planned for next year.
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:11.720]  So if the economy doesn't go down, it's going to be a miracle.
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:16.920]  And I do speak Chinese, and I did apply for your job at yourjobs.com, so.
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:17.920]  Okay, good.
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:21.320]  Well, we're trying to plow through all those, so God bless you, but let me, I remember your
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:25.360]  call now, because you mentioned these speaking Chinese before, so something like six months
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:26.360]  ago or so.
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:33.080]  You're absolutely right that the Vatican is its own city, its own taxes, its own regulations
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:36.360]  and makes itself exempt from everybody else above the law.
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:39.520]  Same thing with the city of London, with in London, that financial center, not the whole
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:43.000]  London, just the small city of London, and within it is its own systems.
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:47.320]  The UN is modeled after that, shut up by the Rockefellers as a holding company.
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:52.840]  So you have three or four of these competing megastates that are above the law exempt.
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:49:55.560]  Israel has kind of set up its own little system like that.
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:50:00.600]  They're what they call city-states, and the globalists admit, once they destroy the nation-state,
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:04.400]  there won't be global kumbaya, they're going to go to only city-states.
[2:50:04.400 --> 2:50:08.600]  That's why people like Peter Thiel has said, maybe they'll have floating islands that are
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:10.840]  their own libertarian city-states.
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:15.200]  So yes, that is the de-evolution they're planning, is back to city-states, and whether you're
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:16.920]  good or bad, that's the fact.
[2:50:16.920 --> 2:50:20.920]  That's what Thiel talked about, Thiel talked about, the tide going out on globalism.
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:21.920]  Anything else, Kristen?
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:29.400]  Yeah, because the Federal Reserve, basically, they print all the funds for a lot of countries,
[2:50:29.400 --> 2:50:34.880]  and the countries that are not having the Federal Reserve print their funds war at war,
[2:50:34.880 --> 2:50:35.880]  like Libya.
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:38.520]  So basically, the Federal Reserve has a lot of power.
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:44.160]  Yes, and it's forcing everyone onto the digital system, and then onto digital Amazon and digital
[2:50:44.160 --> 2:50:48.600]  Google, getting you on their company store, plantation, or more like a reservation.
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:53.720]  And then you can be given the poison blankets, you can be given the Prozac, the firewater,
[2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:55.920]  and be dealt with properly until they put you in the grave.
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:50:57.520]  They'll be right back with more calls.
[2:50:57.520 --> 2:51:27.360]  That's the point, Kristen.
[2:51:28.180 --> 2:51:34.760]  If there's a toxic chemical-biological gas smoke emergency while traveling at home or
[2:51:34.760 --> 2:51:36.560]  on your job, are you protected?
[2:51:36.560 --> 2:51:37.560]  Are you prepared?
[2:51:37.560 --> 2:51:41.920]  There are over 400,000 fires in the USA every year, up to 85% of all deaths on a fire are
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:43.400]  due to smoke inhalation.
[2:51:43.400 --> 2:51:46.200]  Three minutes without air and we as humans will die.
[2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:50.360]  Be prepared and escape safely with our safe escape smokers giving you up to 60 minutes
[2:51:50.360 --> 2:51:52.120]  of breathable air protection.

[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:06.600]  best for you and your family.

[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:15.440]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size.

[2:54:12.160 --> 2:54:20.200]  I don't know when, I'm stuck in fools in prison, and time keeps dragging on.
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:24.520]  We've got a bunch of new memes that our listeners have put forward, exposing the globalist,
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:25.520]  exposing CNN.
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:29.640]  We've got over 2,000 of them sent to us in the last 48 hours since I announced the
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:33.080]  new $20,000 contest that Paul Watson is going to judge.
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:34.320]  He's in the emails as well.
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:37.080]  We're all going to be posting the better ones.
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:42.280]  One of the contests is you must post it to social media yourself, Facebook, Twitter,
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:43.280]  YouTube.
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:46.880]  Because that's part, we want to link to your meme and give it a ton of traffic.
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:53.000]  So if you sent us any of these $2,400 or whatever it is, be sure and post those publicly.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:59.480]  We've got some new compilations of them posted to infowars.com right now, and again, none
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:02.040]  of us wish real violence against CNN.
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:04.360]  They're the ones that have their listeners out shooting people.
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:08.760]  They're just doing this as fun from movies and mean all of this in the information war
[2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:10.480]  as a joke.
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:14.240]  We win as long as nobody's violent against these people.
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:18.000]  Now, right now, while we're taking calls, we'll be playing in the background for TV
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.400]  viewers some of the new memes.
[2:55:20.400 --> 2:55:25.320]  Let's talk to Zach in Florida about the ceasefire that Putin and Trump struck about two hours
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:30.680]  and 15 minutes ago, a big win for the people of Syria and for peace, a big win for Putin
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:31.680]  and Trump.
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:32.680]  Go ahead, Zach.
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:37.200]  Yes, Alex, it's great to be on again and a great show so far.
[2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:44.440]  I just wanted to kind of talk about the significance and importance of July 7, 2017, what Donald
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:49.480]  Trump has just pulled off with this ceasefire is one of the most important things in our
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:50.480]  recent history.
[2:55:50.480 --> 2:55:57.200]  I mean, he literally met with Putin, stopped all this kinetic momentum, double crossed the
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:04.920]  globalist, and he's laying the groundwork for the end of Syria in ISIS as we know it.
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:06.800]  Where's his Nobel Peace Prize?
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:07.800]  Where is his?
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:10.840]  The media and the fake news wants to distract you with moral judgment.
[2:56:10.840 --> 2:56:12.920]  They won't even report on the stock market up.
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:15.720]  They won't even report on successive new jobs.
[2:56:15.720 --> 2:56:16.720]  Absolutely.
[2:56:16.720 --> 2:56:20.040]  I mean, they want to distract you with moral judgment for the man.
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:23.800]  But think about the restraint that was shown when the Russian plane was knocked down, them
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:28.480]  meeting face-to-face, man-to-man, and getting the stuff behind closed doors.
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:34.160]  Trump gave Putin's theory, and Putin will give Trump North Korea.
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:37.840]  This is a major diplomatic point for the U.S., and everyone knows it, knows what they're
[2:56:37.840 --> 2:56:38.840]  looking at.
[2:56:38.840 --> 2:56:39.840]  Major.
[2:56:39.840 --> 2:56:40.840]  Well, exactly.
[2:56:40.840 --> 2:56:47.720]  And now we see China and North Korea, China and Russia saying, you better stop it, North
[2:56:47.720 --> 2:56:48.720]  Korea.
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:51.560]  So I guess that is beginning to greenlight Trump to strike North Korea.
[2:56:51.560 --> 2:56:56.680]  I just wonder if we can take out all their systems before they destroy South Korea.
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:00.720]  Absolutely can, but the only way that's going to be possible is the purging of the deep
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:05.000]  state, because what you see Trump doing right now is brilliant as a dealmaker goes.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:08.920]  He's utilizing these people who still have some ties like Nikki Haley, even I questioned
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:13.320]  some of Tillerson's connections, but he's using them in capacities that we could benefit
[2:57:13.320 --> 2:57:14.320]  from diplomatically.
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:17.200]  But then when they're done and they're compromised, he's going to move on.
[2:57:17.200 --> 2:57:21.240]  But what he's doing and the people he has in positions that some people kind of question,
[2:57:21.240 --> 2:57:22.240]  I think it's brilliant.
[2:57:22.240 --> 2:57:23.240]  I think it's calculated.
[2:57:23.240 --> 2:57:24.240]  It's obvious.
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:25.240]  He's using that.
[2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:26.240]  What is a back channel to spy on the globalist?
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:27.240]  100 percent.
[2:57:27.240 --> 2:57:30.240]  He's using them for what they're worth, letting them get out of Scotchbury.
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:32.520]  And then when he's done, he's moving on to the next.
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:35.840]  And I mean, from a geopolitical timeline perspective, this is obvious.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:40.400]  I mean, they can morally judge him, but what he's done diplomatically, the metric and standard
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:44.640]  that Barack Obama was judged for, for gaining his Nobel Peace Prize, if that was used for
[2:57:44.640 --> 2:57:45.640]  Donald Trump, I'll check it.
[2:57:45.640 --> 2:57:49.840]  He was giving it for doing nothing and then launched a bunch of new wars for radical
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:51.680]  Islam.
[2:57:51.680 --> 2:57:52.680]  Trump's fighting.
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:56.640]  Trump is fighting not only the actual enemy, but he's fighting people within his own country
[2:57:56.640 --> 2:57:57.640]  and his own government.
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:58:01.960]  What's going on behind the scenes will go down in history.
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:03.480]  And again, it's not that he's some angel.
[2:58:03.480 --> 2:58:07.960]  He just wants prosperity and common sense with a pragmatic approach that is not a globalist
[2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:13.680]  approach to artificially create tension so we have a world of crisis.
[2:58:13.680 --> 2:58:14.680]  We presidential.
[2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:17.480]  He just doesn't, you know, go out and go out and retire in the first hundred days, first
[2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:18.880]  couple of five months, six months.
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:23.600]  He meets the Chinese premier, sees their fans, gives them some time, lets them prove themselves.
[2:58:23.600 --> 2:58:24.600]  They don't.
[2:58:24.600 --> 2:58:25.600]  They, they up trade.
[2:58:25.600 --> 2:58:28.000]  He puts out a strategic tweet earlier in the week saying, look what China has done after
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:33.120]  North Korea missile launch, then right on time, he meets the, meets the bottom air Putin
[2:58:33.120 --> 2:58:34.120]  and it's done.
[2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:35.120]  That's right.
[2:58:35.120 --> 2:58:39.920]  He's got the different paths already lined out with strategic long-term analysis and thinking,
[2:58:39.920 --> 2:58:42.240]  but changing as the situation changes.
[2:58:42.240 --> 2:58:43.240]  Great point, Zach.
[2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:49.240]  Aaron, Rod, Carlos, Jim, your call straight ahead and we got a special guest coming up.
[2:58:49.240 --> 2:58:53.880]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA forces finally arrived
[2:58:53.880 --> 2:58:56.000]  at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:59:00.120]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto ship to receive
[2:59:00.120 --> 2:59:04.120]  out of stock products at DNA force and we are now once again expected to sell out very,
[2:59:04.120 --> 2:59:05.120]  very soon.
[2:59:05.120 --> 2:59:08.880]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game changer like DNA force, we never know
[2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:12.520]  when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[2:59:12.520 --> 2:59:17.680]  The secret behind DNA force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ-10,
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:23.840]  systematic enzymes, NAR, lapolic acid, BioPQQ and many others, BioPQQ alone is backed by
[2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:28.800]  an unprecedented 175 clinical studies and just one batch of this stuff costs us more
[2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:29.800]  than $30,000.
[2:59:29.800 --> 2:59:33.360]  Visit m4slife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[2:59:33.360 --> 2:59:38.960]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third party
[2:59:38.960 --> 2:59:41.480]  certified review agency Power Review.
[2:59:41.480 --> 2:59:46.120]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA force today at m4slife.com before
[2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:47.120]  it sells out again.
[2:59:47.120 --> 3:00:15.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:32.680]  I'll be looking for eight when they pull that game and I hope that judging's light.
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:37.200]  Well the one and the only, Mike Cernovich, always with amazing information and cutting
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:40.320]  analysis is going to be hosting in T-minus about seven minutes.
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:44.280]  So get ready for Mike Cernovich, please tell people to tune in, please spread the streams
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:50.080]  whether you're listening to us on local radio or listening to us, you know, shortwave or
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:51.080]  on the internet.
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:52.480]  Whatever you do, keep spreading the word.
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:00:56.880]  You are the human potential against their AI system, using their AI against them.
[3:00:56.880 --> 3:01:00.800]  When you're conscious, you direct the AI, not the AI you.
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:03.080]  We use the machines, not the other way around.
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:04.960]  We do the hanging.
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:08.960]  Darren in Tennessee, another caller from the great state of Tennessee.
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:09.960]  Great.
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:13.720]  That's a nice job you're doing to follow us.
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:14.720]  Thank you.
[3:01:14.720 --> 3:01:17.320]  Alex, I got three brief points.
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:23.960]  The first one I learned yesterday, my boy's going to Afghanistan, he's in the 82nd airborne.
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:28.560]  And there's a lot of things that the military is charging soldiers nowadays that used to
[3:01:28.560 --> 3:01:32.840]  be free like meals, $300 a month and then a lot of times they don't get to eat it.
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:36.960]  A lot of expenses they had to pay for things they need going to Afghanistan at the last
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:37.960]  minute.
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:45.080]  I learned yesterday that when they go there, there's no phone service, but to get the meager
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:52.520]  third world level Wi-Fi they have there to be able to speak at home, they're paying $50
[3:01:52.520 --> 3:01:56.240]  a month at Bragg and they split it up amongst themselves to make it cheaper.
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:02.080]  It's going to be nearly $100 a man there and they have it set up so that you can't share
[3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:03.080]  it between soldiers.
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:04.440]  There's only one person who can pay.
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:06.960]  It's nearly, like I said, nearly $100 a head.
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:07.960]  Yeah.
[3:02:07.960 --> 3:02:08.960]  Trump needs to know about that.
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:14.160]  That's clearly a way like the company store we were talking about to rip off soldiers.
[3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:17.800]  I looked up last night, Hughes is the one that has this contract.
[3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:18.800]  Who does?
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:20.600]  And they're using Hughes, Hughes.
[3:02:20.600 --> 3:02:23.360]  Oh, Hughes Electronics, okay.
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:28.000]  Hughes, yeah, I have it right here and I tried to call them.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  You know Hughes has been the CIA since the 50s.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.200]  Well, listen to this, Alex.
[3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:39.600]  They are also subcontracting with this little company outside of Detroit, they call it Abcastat.
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:43.360]  And there's a gentleman named Stard Hageer, that's the president of this company.
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:45.880]  It's only got 12 people, including himself.
[3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:49.040]  They make two and a half million dollars a year.
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:54.080]  This guy is also, he went to the University of Bahrain, College of Engineering.
[3:02:54.080 --> 3:02:55.080]  Of course.
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:56.600]  He's a communications man that speaks.
[3:02:56.600 --> 3:03:02.400]  He's also involved now with a little college outside of Detroit, mostly Arabic kids and
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:03.400]  American kids.
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:07.160]  Yeah, I mean, when I say Muslims are taking over Hollywood, that's in the news that Saudi
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:11.240]  Arabia is buying it up and that the Chinese are as well and that everywhere I turn around
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:17.000]  the Federal Reserve or in school lunch programs, it's rich Muslims getting government contracts.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.120]  And they ought to be citizens if they're going to get it.
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:22.840]  I mean, if somebody's a U.S. citizen, a Muslim, fine, let them have a contract, I'm a free
[3:03:22.840 --> 3:03:26.280]  market guy, but not when they just come here to basically take over.
[3:03:26.280 --> 3:03:29.480]  That's the kind of thing you ought to write up in an article and post to the Internet
[3:03:29.480 --> 3:03:30.760]  so more people learn about it.
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:32.560]  That would be interesting.
[3:03:32.560 --> 3:03:37.800]  Okay, my second point now that you mentioned it, speaking of the IRS, you know, that was
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:38.800]  a great job.
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:43.520]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, you know, putting that out, how they stole the money from Fannie Mae and
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:45.960]  Freddie Mac, you know, and got away with it.
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:48.160]  And now I'm a retired firefighter on disability.
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:51.800]  I served 16 and a half years in the city outside of Fort Lauderdale.
[3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:56.480]  And one of the things when we get our disability, we took a huge cut and, you know, our benefit
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:03:59.040]  which we paid into.
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:06.520]  The IRS is now offsetting our MIGRA raises that we get, their cost of living increase.
[3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:10.040]  That's been, you know, established in case law that that's not garnishable.
[3:04:10.040 --> 3:04:11.040]  That's not deductible.
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:12.040]  That's not taxable.
[3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:18.200]  However, the IRS has begun every single year that I get, and it doesn't happen, Obama
[3:04:18.200 --> 3:04:20.920]  cut that out several years where there was no cost of living increase.
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:23.720]  But every time I get one now, they take the entire amount.
[3:04:23.720 --> 3:04:26.440]  They subsidize themselves with our cost of living increase.
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:28.440]  That's another story that I think needs to be brought up.
[3:04:28.440 --> 3:04:31.600]  Brother, and people should all be conscious of that and aware of that everywhere you are.
[3:04:31.600 --> 3:04:32.800]  Don't be complainers.
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:33.800]  Just demand free market.
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:35.560]  Hey, I demand competition.
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:39.840]  If what you're getting is at the lowest price and you're not allowed to have competition,
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:40.840]  it's a scam.
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:43.560]  If it's the lowest price and works good, you know somebody did a good job.
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:45.600]  And then if you're in a government job, how are you going to complain?
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:48.160]  But if it isn't a good deal, you demand quality.
[3:04:48.160 --> 3:04:49.160]  That's how we drain the swamp.
[3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:50.160]  All right, we'll be back.
[3:04:50.160 --> 3:04:52.480]  I'm going to introduce Mike Cernovich straight ahead.
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:59.480]  Stay with us.
[3:05:53.480 --> 3:05:56.240]  For infowars.com, that's the DNC.
[3:05:56.240 --> 3:05:59.480]  This is Owen Schreuer.
[3:05:59.480 --> 3:06:04.960]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[3:06:04.960 --> 3:06:09.800]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[3:06:09.800 --> 3:06:12.600]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:06:12.600 --> 3:06:18.920]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:24.920]  of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet
[3:06:24.920 --> 3:06:25.920]  war.
[3:06:25.920 --> 3:06:30.400]  Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:35.440]  vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:39.040]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[3:06:39.040 --> 3:06:46.880]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[3:06:46.880 --> 3:06:50.160]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[3:07:59.040 --> 3:08:10.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:11.360]  the info war.
[3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:18.760]  Well, Mike Cernovich has got a powerful meme factory going with his small intrepid team
[3:08:18.760 --> 3:08:25.600]  that I've seen all over the news having a great effect the image of the plug being pulled
[3:08:25.600 --> 3:08:26.600]  on CNN.
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:32.840]  I love the one where Trump's eyes flash white and the Nazi symbol flash CNN blows up.
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:35.360]  But we're not wishing any real violence here.
[3:08:35.360 --> 3:08:38.920]  This is metaphorical of, you know, taking down a condemned building.
[3:08:38.920 --> 3:08:40.200]  I don't just say this for effect.
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:42.160]  You look at their ratings.
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:47.520]  You look at how their own brethren in fake news, Washington Post, others are turning
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:48.520]  on them.
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:59.320]  CNN, I think you can say 7777 is the day we can say for a fact dead on arrival, CNN has
[3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:01.120]  given up the ghost.
[3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:02.360]  CNN is no longer with us.
[3:09:02.360 --> 3:09:03.640]  CNN is dead.
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:05.720]  Now it's like we can at Bernie's.
[3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:08.480]  We can at at at at at at Zuckers.
[3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:14.600]  They're still going to prop it up and then the guts are going to blow it up and then
[3:09:14.600 --> 3:09:15.600]  spell out.
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:19.320]  There's going to be maggots pouring out the ears and, you know, crows are going to pull
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:21.880]  eyeballs out and it's going to smell really bad.
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:24.400]  And that's pretty much we kind of found out they've been dead for a while now.
[3:09:24.400 --> 3:09:27.840]  It's like, whoa, it's like a bloated body, you know, been at the bottom of the ocean
[3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:32.600]  for a week and it kind of comes up and then, you know, it's just, it's disgusting.
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:36.680]  And I don't mean to use gross analogies, but I mean, they've already got fifth stringers
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:38.760]  on there.
[3:09:38.760 --> 3:09:43.040]  Just I love Laura Lermer tweeted out, been put to go to her tweet with one of the CNN
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:44.040]  hosts.
[3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:46.240]  The guy looks like Humpty Dumpty and said, I don't even know this is a real baby you're
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:48.320]  supposedly holding to show how you're a human.
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:49.320]  It's probably fake.
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:50.320]  It probably is.
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:54.800]  I mean, you can't believe anything out of known liars.
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:09:56.120]  That's why they said the sky was blue.
[3:09:56.120 --> 3:09:57.280]  We'd have to question it.
[3:09:57.280 --> 3:10:00.120]  They said babies were being thrown out of incubators again in Iraq.
[3:10:00.120 --> 3:10:01.120]  They've been caught lying once.
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:02.400]  I'd say, well, maybe it didn't true.
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:06.600]  If it turns out it is true, I'm not against the families that lost their babies.
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:08.520]  Known liars reported it.
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:12.600]  If it turns out to be true, we'll say it's sad if it isn't, you know, but again, the
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:14.760]  babies were not thrown out of incubators.
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:17.840]  So that's how all this works.
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:18.840]  They're known liars.
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:19.840]  We have to question.
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:25.720]  So taking over is Mike Sernovich and author, researcher will put his websites up on screen
[3:10:25.720 --> 3:10:27.320]  for TV viewers.
[3:10:27.320 --> 3:10:31.480]  Mike, do you agree with me or maybe it was a few months ago, but we kind of found the
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:37.640]  body in the woods now that, that, that CNN can be declared dead at this point.
[3:10:37.640 --> 3:10:44.000]  Well, I sent in some great ratings information to your wonderful production team.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:50.320]  Let's compare Paul Joseph Watson's YouTube videos to the top rated shows on CNN side
[3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:54.320]  by side, which is let the numbers do the talk.
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:59.880]  CNN would kill to get the audience that Paul Joseph Watson has for every video, for every
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:02.840]  video PJW does, Paul the great does.
[3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:06.440]  He is by far bigger than anybody.
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:11.480]  So Jeff Geesey put up a tweet, which was really good and I, and I sent out that they had it.
[3:11:11.480 --> 3:11:16.640]  You can compare on the one side, CNN's ratings, you know, 700,000 people to watch them.
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:21.280]  And then Paul Joseph Watson, three, four, five million people watch his videos.
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:23.640]  You know, we should really do this professionally with the graphics and everything.
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:25.600]  I've meant to do this, but we kind of don't want to brag.
[3:11:25.600 --> 3:11:28.400]  You don't want to brag, but we could, we should show like we did.
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:31.080]  Megan Kelly had 3.3 million viewers.
[3:11:31.080 --> 3:11:33.480]  Now it's even less the week after.
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:37.920]  And then you had videos over 11 million just talking about it to a three of them.
[3:11:37.920 --> 3:11:41.560]  We had even more than that all together, not even counting the radio show or anything else.
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:46.640]  Like something like 20 something million views of us talking about her.
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:48.480]  No wonder she got destroyed.
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:50.000]  No one wants to tune in.
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:54.040]  She just advertised herself as a globalist, not even as a fake Fox news person.
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:57.720]  So of course they're saying she's going to be basically removed soon.
[3:11:57.720 --> 3:11:59.040]  It's not that we're that good.
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:00.040]  They're that bad.
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:04.440]  The average Watson video, if you combine Facebook and YouTube has about 3 million views.
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:07.080]  Well there aren't even shows on CNN with 3 million views.
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:08.080]  That's what I mean.
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:13.960]  But despite that Don Lemon and people think they're powerful and now reruns of Yogi Bear,
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:17.880]  that's up on info wars.com with the Nielsen ratings are beating CNN.
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:23.920]  This despite the fact it's force fed low on the cable dial, force fed in hospitals and
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:29.160]  in waiting rooms and in government offices and in airports, as you've said, it's time
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:32.720]  to remove this detritus from the airports.
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:33.720]  Yeah.
[3:12:33.720 --> 3:12:37.640]  And especially from the schools, actually, we broke the story.
[3:12:37.640 --> 3:12:39.640]  I think last week I have to write it up.
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:40.640]  I've been so busy.
[3:12:40.640 --> 3:12:41.640]  There's so much going on.
[3:12:41.640 --> 3:12:47.000]  But I heard from parents across the country that their children in grade school, third,
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:50.240]  fourth, fifth grade, they're forced to watch 20 minutes a day.
[3:12:50.240 --> 3:12:51.600]  They can't do homework during it.
[3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:53.040]  They have to watch it.
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:56.040]  So this is a really big story that we need to build up and develop.
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:12:57.040]  All right.
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:01.560]  Well, I want to get out of here because I'm going to talk over you if I don't love having
[3:13:01.560 --> 3:13:02.560]  you the show.
[3:13:02.560 --> 3:13:05.880]  We're getting close to launching your transmission, but just so much happening.
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:06.880]  I'm really worried though.
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:09.040]  We're getting overconfident, myself included.
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:10.040]  They're going to strike back.
[3:13:10.040 --> 3:13:13.280]  I'm worried about them launching a false flag on themselves like you and Laura and others
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:14.280]  are.
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:20.160]  They keep saying we're trying to call for violence, even though all our memes are clearly jokes.
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:24.720]  So what do you think they're going to do because they try to say nobody wants to shake Trump's
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:25.720]  hand.
[3:13:25.720 --> 3:13:26.720]  That's all made up.
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:29.480]  They just keep trying to say like, we're not the cool kids.
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:34.800]  When everybody knows they're the most uncool kids in the world, I haven't seen memes that
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:35.880]  are pro CNN.
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:42.000]  I haven't seen support for CNN other than weird bot echo chamber weirdos, many of which
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:46.960]  aren't even real people on Twitter and Facebook that just keep trying to demoralize us saying,
[3:13:46.960 --> 3:13:47.960]  you're losing.
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:48.960]  You're a joke.
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:49.960]  You're a failure.
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:51.160]  We're going to strike Tokyo rose.
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:56.340]  We've already dropped little, little boy and fat man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[3:13:56.340 --> 3:13:58.200]  We've just killed 10 million Japanese.
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:13:59.340]  We don't want to do it.
[3:13:59.340 --> 3:14:03.300]  They're still broadcasting that they beat us and the Japanese have entered the capital
[3:14:03.300 --> 3:14:07.360]  in DC in and killed, killed President Truman.
[3:14:07.360 --> 3:14:12.320]  They're announcing they've taken DC when we're dropping a bombs on their heads.
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:13.320]  Yeah.
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:16.360]  The same thing is true of during the election.
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:18.280]  Nobody was doing memes for Hillary.
[3:14:18.280 --> 3:14:23.480]  doing means for CNN. They don't have any organic national support from the people, the people
[3:14:23.480 --> 3:14:28.760]  of any age. That's why they have to indoctrinate people. So in terms of the false flag, actually,
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:33.160]  a foreign policy, which is basically owned by the Council of Foreign Relations, they're
[3:14:33.160 --> 3:14:38.520]  doing a hit job on me. They're actually planning it now. And I'll show the DMs once the hit
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:43.920]  article appears. So I've got intelligence that the Council of Foreign Relations are really
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:48.040]  angry at the national security reporting I've been doing about McMasters. So they've sent
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:14:53.160]  a journalist from foreign policy after me to write about me and cry about me and use anonymous
[3:14:53.160 --> 3:14:58.600]  sources to make stuff up. So there's already a false flag going to come on me, a false flag
[3:14:58.600 --> 3:15:03.160]  hit article from foreign policy, which is the mouthpiece of the Council of Foreign Relations.
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:09.080]  They got real upset just a few weeks ago when you were pointing stuff out because they hate it.
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:13.000]  We're pointing out they're burrowed into the White House and we're going to remove these ticks.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:19.240]  Yeah. And that's exactly what is going on. They go, well, I'm hearing from sources that they don't
[3:15:19.240 --> 3:15:24.760]  like your article. So I asked this person, a journalist, and I go, I go, why are you working
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:28.760]  as their PR agents? Why don't you tell your sources to come to me? They got a problem with me,
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:33.640]  come talk to me, get my face. But that's not how they work. So all these people in the media,
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:36.680]  oh, we're journalists and we're spreading the truth and everything. They're nothing.
[3:15:36.680 --> 3:15:42.280]  And it scares us when they go, you know, big people don't like what you're doing. Oh, really?
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:47.640]  You mean I'm in a big boy game? Oh, you, oh, I'm so scared. Oh.
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:53.960]  Yeah. And they haven't figured out, they haven't figured it out yet. I want a hit job.
[3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:58.600]  We're coming after them. We want the enemy to open up on us politically because they're the
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:05.400]  enemy. We want everyone to know the enemy hates us. It's a celebration. Exactly. But they don't
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:10.440]  get it. And that is why they keep losing us. Another hit job. They do a hit job. I'm jealous.
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:16.040]  I want more hit jobs. I want, I don't just say this. I want more. I want more.
[3:16:17.080 --> 3:16:21.720]  Yeah, it gets boring. It gets boring. All you guys, Megan Kelly, all you guys,
[3:16:22.360 --> 3:16:30.440]  that idiot at CNN who lost his job to bring me more. Yeah, Reza, Megan Kelly, Kathy Griffin,
[3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:35.560]  and CNN threatening to dock somebody. So what we're doing now, we are forced and this is where
[3:16:35.560 --> 3:16:40.760]  you said you and I have to be careful. You're right. We, we have the enemy making a lot of
[3:16:40.760 --> 3:16:44.280]  mistakes because they're all stressed out. They're nowhere scrutinizing. Well, there are a bunch of
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:47.880]  thugs. They had to hire cowards and sellouts to begin with. They're gonna be mentally ill
[3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:52.040]  narcissists. So they're so delusional that they think they're always winning even when they're
[3:16:52.040 --> 3:16:57.720]  losing. So they keep doubling down. Exactly. So what we have to do is we have to keep hitting them
[3:16:57.720 --> 3:17:03.000]  hard, but we definitely have to be careful. We have to avoid that we don't get roofied by deep
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:07.480]  state. You know, they'll put stuff in our drinks if we're not careful. Sex operatives. Yeah, you
[3:17:07.480 --> 3:17:13.000]  got to be real careful. So whenever I'm out now, I always, I'll never go more than like in half an
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:17.480]  hour without texting or tweeting somebody that way. If, you know, that's how you can tell that,
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:21.400]  you know, they're not able to kidnap me or roofing me or get me while I'm hiking the trail
[3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:26.120]  or something like that. We have to be very, very vigilant. I'm telling you, it's a whole new ball
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:32.840]  game, my friend. Where do you expect them to go from here though? Well, they're trying
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:38.520]  to get us banned from social media. So for example, that Linda Sarser did a video where she said,
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:47.320]  I support Jihad and we must wage a Jihad against Trump. So all I did was took that video and added
[3:17:47.320 --> 3:17:52.680]  subtitles and captions and they're trying to get me banned from social media because I'm inciting
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:58.840]  harassment. Wait, how am I inciting harassment? Yeah, she gets hundreds of millions of Soros money
[3:17:58.840 --> 3:18:03.960]  to put women in a jibs and be in USA today saying where you're a jib for feminism. She's saying,
[3:18:03.960 --> 3:18:10.680]  I am wanting Jihad against the Trump and we're like, Hey, this is BS. And then you're the bad guy.
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:15.480]  Yeah. And I didn't even say it was BS. All I did was said, here's the video,
[3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:20.520]  watch for yourself. So what they're, the fake news is trying to make it sound like real journalism,
[3:18:20.520 --> 3:18:25.720]  doing actual reporting. And now we're inciting terrorism. They tried that with the K-Fall guy
[3:18:25.720 --> 3:18:30.680]  too. You know, he threatens to dock somebody. We report on it. And then they want to say,
[3:18:30.680 --> 3:18:34.920]  Oh, you guys are really just trying to incite harassment and the adiata. Yeah. And I love
[3:18:34.920 --> 3:18:38.280]  how they're just going to all get together and throw more money at fighting us. All that does
[3:18:38.280 --> 3:18:42.600]  is get us bigger. And I don't say that to make it sound positive. It's true. I don't get they
[3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:47.800]  don't understand. Everyone hates them. The New World Order media is like a restaurant where
[3:18:47.800 --> 3:18:54.280]  everybody gets leprosy, food poisoning and AIDS. No one's ever going in there. It's not like one
[3:18:54.280 --> 3:18:59.320]  or two people got AIDS eating your restaurant. They're all basically politically dying. You people
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:05.000]  are the scourge of the earth. You are the hated anathema filth. You are the greatest trash joke
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:09.320]  nerds. Hollywood's a joke. It's all falling. All they've got is little kids still thinking
[3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:13.160]  Hollywood's cool. Turn to it. Take over. Thanks for hosting. Yeah. I mean, well, even the Harvard
[3:19:13.160 --> 3:19:18.280]  Business Review has a new article, The Truth About Globalization. I actually had to get money.
[3:19:18.280 --> 3:19:21.720]  And as much as it's collapsing, it shows a globe, a beach ball globe that's deflated.
[3:19:21.720 --> 3:19:28.520]  Yeah. So we're not here that first. Yeah. They're freaking out and they're talking about how,
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:33.560]  you know, media, media sentiment is soured and everything like that. They're freaking out.
[3:19:33.560 --> 3:19:37.240]  Harvard Business Review, Council form relations. They're now admitting the Democratic Party's
[3:19:37.240 --> 3:19:43.400]  over. They're now turning on themselves. I mean, this is delicious. Yeah. It's an incredible
[3:19:43.400 --> 3:19:48.040]  amount of fun for us. I mean, that's what I always tell these people as I go, all you have to do.
[3:19:48.040 --> 3:19:51.960]  Do I look tired? No, get into the fight. Make it exciting. And that's the thing.
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:19:56.200]  We're not putting a good face on this. The enemy is melting down worse than we thought,
[3:19:56.200 --> 3:20:00.760]  but the empire will strike back. Yeah. And we do this every day. It's been said,
[3:20:00.760 --> 3:20:06.760]  any society, you know, let's get them right. Cut it off. Those times may be near. Think about it.
[3:20:06.760 --> 3:20:11.400]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[3:20:11.400 --> 3:20:16.360]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns
[3:20:16.360 --> 3:20:21.240]  and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single
[3:20:21.240 --> 3:20:25.800]  cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it
[3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:30.520]  can't provide during a widespread national emergency. That's why you need your own plan

[3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:15.560]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:25.480]  host, Mike Cernovich. And we're back, Mike Cernovich, Facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich,
[3:24:25.480 --> 3:24:31.880]  bringing you Fake News Watch. We've had a lot of fake news come up in the day and I love it when
[3:24:31.880 --> 3:24:36.840]  we get fake news in the mainstream media because it puts them on their back foot. So let's focus on
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:42.440]  one set of fake news and I'll kind of tee it up and then they have a great video production team
[3:24:42.440 --> 3:24:48.680]  has a great video and we'll watch that. But as you know, if Alex Jones one day said he had turkey
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:53.960]  for lunch and then a reporter goes, well, actually, he had chicken. The fake news, you can't trust
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:25:01.480]  anything, right? Let us get one thing wrong ever and they try for our entire lives to follow that.
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:07.080]  Well, he said one time in 2011, this one thing and it was wrong. These people, though, they're
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:16.520]  getting it wrong every day. So let's use a recent example. As we know, 17 agencies did not say Russia
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:23.400]  and Trump colluded. We all know this is a fact, okay? But if you go to the Ironically Tied of
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:31.400]  Politifact, they go, well, we said in an article that all 17 intelligence agencies found collusion.
[3:25:31.400 --> 3:25:39.320]  Well, now it's only really four, but it doesn't really matter, right? It could be 17. We said 17
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:46.040]  because we thought that was more damaging. But now that that's wrong, and it's only four, well,
[3:25:46.040 --> 3:25:53.480]  it doesn't really matter because, you know, they are admitting that they do not pay strupulous
[3:25:53.480 --> 3:25:58.520]  attention to the facts. Two more people in the fake news media spread that same lie and I can't
[3:25:58.520 --> 3:26:04.040]  and I can't even keep track. I'm going to have to hire an intern to just monitor the fake news
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:09.320]  because it's so much every day. Very fake news, Jim Acosta, who is screaming that he has pinned
[3:26:09.320 --> 3:26:15.000]  tweets as we are fake or we are real news. He claimed that 17 intelligence agencies
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:22.120]  found collusion between Trump and Russia. Well, that's fake. He didn't apologize. He didn't come
[3:26:22.120 --> 3:26:31.000]  forward. He didn't say, I got that wrong. KD Tour of NBC tweeted out 17 agencies. It is 17,
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:38.360]  Mr. President. It is 17 agencies, Mr. President. It was only four. She deleted a tweet. She hasn't
[3:26:38.360 --> 3:26:44.600]  apologized. She has an issue or attraction. NBC has an issue or attraction. CNN has an issue
[3:26:44.600 --> 3:26:51.000]  or attraction. So that Politifact, they can't, Politifact said, well, I mean, we got it wrong.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:56.040]  It was only four, but not 17. But it doesn't matter anyway, because something, something,
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:27:00.520]  something, you know, hope you have a goldfish memory and you just forget about, forget about
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:07.480]  what you said. But that's the fake news every day. So they have to go back years to find anything
[3:27:07.480 --> 3:27:12.280]  that I got wrong. They have to go back years to find anything that Alex Jones got wrong.
[3:27:12.280 --> 3:27:19.320]  But then they act like that's all we do, even though we give real news 99,999.99999 percent
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:24.440]  of the time, occasionally, but then when we apologize, they treat us like we're the bad guys,
[3:27:24.440 --> 3:27:29.880]  right? When we actually say, well, you know, that story went off the rails. That's why I don't talk
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:34.920]  about it anymore. Then they go, oh, see, they admit, they admit they spread fake news. We're
[3:27:34.920 --> 3:27:40.200]  actually, no, we're real news because we're correcting ourselves. So Jim Acosta has not
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:47.080]  apologized for that fake article. Neither has KD Tour. Politifact hasn't apologized.
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:51.000]  So speaking of Jim Acosta, we have a great video on him. Let's load that up and watch that.
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:56.920]  Again, say you think it was Russia. Your intelligence agencies have been far more definitive.
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:03.080]  They say it was Russia. Why won't you agree with them? I'll tell you, let me just start off by saying
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:08.040]  I heard it was 17 agencies. I said, boy, that's a lot. Do we even have that many
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:13.960]  intelligence agencies, right? Let's check it. And we did some very heavy research. It turned out to be
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:19.880]  three or four. It wasn't 17. And many of your compatriots had to change their reporting,
[3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:23.880]  and they had to apologize, and they had to correct. Now, with that being said,
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:31.560]  mistakes have been made. I agree. I think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people
[3:28:31.560 --> 3:28:37.400]  and or countries. And I see nothing wrong with that statement. When he said, well, I keep hearing
[3:28:37.400 --> 3:28:42.040]  it's 17 intelligence agencies that say Russia meddled in the election. I think it's only three
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:46.680]  or four. Where does that number come from? Where is this three or four number come from?
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:51.240]  My suspicion, Chris and Poppy, is that if I go to the administration and ask them this question,
[3:28:51.240 --> 3:28:57.000]  I'm not so sure. We are real news, Mr. President tweeted out, or yeah, that's his pen tweet. And
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:02.920]  he goes, we got we got Trump again. We got him again. And this is the great thing we now have
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:08.440]  CNN on the run. We have he's making dumb mistakes. They're not they think, oh, we got Trump again.
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:14.760]  We got Trump busted this time. They're drunk with power, and they're making a lot of mistakes. And
[3:29:14.760 --> 3:29:20.840]  that is why we have to keep pushing the advantage. That is why we got to keep going hard every day
[3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:26.520]  because Jim Acosta is going to want they want to correct you, right? They're so quick to correct
[3:29:26.520 --> 3:29:30.840]  you. And they're so drunk with power, and they're so unaccountable. And they're used to nobody
[3:29:30.840 --> 3:29:35.320]  ever calling them out. And for them not fact checking, that they don't understand what's
[3:29:35.320 --> 3:29:41.240]  going on. Speaking of Jim Acosta, there's more about him, more fake news about Jim Acosta. He
[3:29:41.240 --> 3:30:06.840]  lied to the public a couple weeks ago. We're going to cover that again right after the break.
[3:30:11.560 --> 3:30:17.880]  reruns of Yogi Bear with the Trump Russia collusion story fading into the background,
[3:30:17.880 --> 3:30:23.560]  an issue that CNN vigorously pushed for ratings despite knowing it was fake news.
[3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:29.240]  The network's ratings are now plummeting. And there's no doubt that CNN's most recent scandal
[3:30:29.240 --> 3:30:36.280]  that sparked hashtag CNN blackmail has played a role after CNN threatened to dock some random gift
[3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:42.520]  creator that President Trump happened to retweet. To put things into perspective, the CNN app now
[3:30:42.520 --> 3:30:48.840]  has only one star out of five in the Apple App Store, where comparably the Fox News app has
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:54.920]  three and a half stars. Whereas the Info Wars and Alex Jones radio app have both four and a
[3:30:54.920 --> 3:31:01.800]  half stars. I'm Milla Weaver reporting for infowars.com. Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can
[3:31:01.800 --> 3:31:07.240]  help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100%
[3:31:07.240 --> 3:31:11.960]  organic coffee on the planet. For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the
[3:31:11.960 --> 3:31:16.280]  high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown
[3:31:16.280 --> 3:31:22.200]  arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[3:31:22.200 --> 3:31:29.000]  Discover and try a bag of the patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[3:31:38.360 --> 3:31:44.120]  taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers. Dropped by the site

[3:31:53.720 --> 3:31:59.800]  enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[3:31:59.800 --> 3:32:04.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[3:32:04.840 --> 3:32:09.960]  seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:15.560]  the body. That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's
[3:32:15.560 --> 3:32:21.240]  made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with
[3:32:21.240 --> 3:32:27.160]  detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that
[3:32:27.160 --> 3:32:32.520]  I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[3:32:32.520 --> 3:32:36.920]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your
[3:32:36.920 --> 3:32:42.520]  family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as
[3:32:42.520 --> 3:32:48.920]  clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those
[3:32:48.920 --> 3:32:53.240]  rush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support
[3:32:53.240 --> 3:32:57.240]  and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with
[3:32:57.240 --> 3:33:12.440]  Z Shield and infowarslife.com. News analysis reports it's the Alex Jones show and now your host Mike
[3:33:12.440 --> 3:33:19.800]  Cerdovich. I'm glad to tell you guys and cows listening at home with DNA Force is finally
[3:33:19.800 --> 3:33:25.480]  back on stock. When I came in to visit I was trying to get some for myself because I do use the
[3:33:25.480 --> 3:33:30.040]  products that I talk about otherwise I wouldn't talk about them and DNA Force they told me it was
[3:33:30.040 --> 3:33:34.680]  out of stock and I had met with them. I'm not going to tell you who but I met with the people who
[3:33:34.680 --> 3:33:40.440]  are responsible for distribution and they said it's so hard to keep it in stock because of the
[3:33:40.440 --> 3:33:44.360]  raw ingredients and when you run out of the raw ingredients and the formulations are kept a certain
[3:33:44.360 --> 3:33:49.800]  way, then you run out and it costs a lot of money to produce. It's a very, very valuable product,
[3:33:49.800 --> 3:33:56.440]  very, very healthy for your body as antioxidants. It makes people feel so much better. So I'm glad
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:01.160]  that it's back in stock because I need to get some for myself and I do believe it's 20% off right
[3:34:01.160 --> 3:34:07.480]  now at infowarslife.com, DNA Force. It is 20% off. Okay, I'm seeing it on screen. So yeah,
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:13.160]  it is 20% off. It's finally back in stock. That one is a great product especially too
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:18.520]  for the people here who you know I don't want to call anybody old but for the people you know
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:24.200]  say on the other side of maybe 40. This is when products like these are especially helpful,
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:27.960]  very, very powerful stuff. So I'm glad to announce that that's back in stock.
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:35.480]  And you know what else is back in stock? Jim Acosta. I just I may call me you know,
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:41.400]  I don't know. It's my hobby. I could never get enough beating up Jim Acosta. It is,
[3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:47.720]  it never gets old to me. It never stops being fun making fun of CNN. So Jim Acosta we saw yesterday
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:53.080]  claimed oh, oh, you know, Trump said that it was only three or four intelligence agencies
[3:34:53.080 --> 3:35:00.440]  who found collusion. It was really 17 and so he lied, but he actually fabricated a source.
[3:35:00.440 --> 3:35:06.840]  And this was to make Trump look bad. So I'll take you back to when Congressman Scalisi was shot.
[3:35:07.800 --> 3:35:14.520]  He was shot. And then very fake news, Jim Acosta tweeted out Donald Trump did not
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:20.920]  meet him in the hospital according to an official source. This is his exact tweet.
[3:35:21.480 --> 3:35:27.240]  White House official on Trump visit. President Trump did not meet with Scalise and did not go
[3:35:27.240 --> 3:35:32.440]  to the room where he has been treated. What a monster Trump is. What a terrible person.
[3:35:32.440 --> 3:35:38.120]  Very fake news Jim Acosta has a White House official as a source. Well, it was fake.
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:44.200]  It actually that is a complete and total fabrication. That was a complete and total lie.
[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:49.560]  Trump had visited him. And then here's how very fake news Jim Acosta tried to weasel's way out.
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:58.600]  He goes, well, I was just quoting the press, right? So he first said, White House official
[3:35:58.600 --> 3:36:03.720]  says Trump didn't visit Scalise, didn't go into his room. And then people go, actually,
[3:36:03.720 --> 3:36:08.040]  that's a lie. You're a fraud, dude. That isn't what happened. Trump did go in there.
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:11.480]  And then Acosta goes, oh, well, I was only quoting the White House press pool.
[3:36:12.280 --> 3:36:17.000]  Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Jim. Wait a minute, Jim. You're dealing with the lawyer here.
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:21.480]  I'm a lawyer and a journalist. Do you think I'm just going to let you get away with that kind of
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:26.440]  BS? You think that I can't keep track of what you just said five minutes ago, Jim?
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:30.760]  You're not dealing with the low IQ idiots who deal with it on a normal basis at CNN.
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:37.240]  You're dealing with the lawyer. So Jim, your tweet said White House official quote.
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:41.960]  So you can't believe another press pool. The press pool is not a White House official.
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:47.720]  So that's what Jim Acosta does. That's how fake he is. He fabricated a source.
[3:36:47.720 --> 3:36:52.120]  That is journalistic fraud. That is unethical journalistic. Of course, he wasn't fired,
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:57.880]  right? Of course, he wasn't fired from CNN, even though he made up a source. And then he goes,
[3:36:57.880 --> 3:37:04.040]  oh, well, you know, got it from the press pool. No, Jim, you made up a source. You are a fraud.
[3:37:04.040 --> 3:37:09.560]  You are very fake news. He was never fired. The only reason, a lot of people don't know this,
[3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:14.920]  the only reason those three journalists, journalists at CNN were fired,
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:19.880]  were lying about Stereo Mucci, for Mucci, as his friends call him, is because
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:27.080]  he was going to sue him for $100 million. He was going to sue CNN into bankruptcy, just like,
[3:37:27.080 --> 3:37:32.680]  because Stereo Mucci has been very successful, private equity, done a lot of real estate deals,
[3:37:32.680 --> 3:37:36.040]  has the money to take on CNN. He goes, fine, I'm going to sue you, $100 million.
[3:37:36.040 --> 3:37:41.720]  He goes, Jeff Zucker freaked out, oh my God, oh my God, we got to do something. That's the only
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:49.240]  reason they got fired. They didn't get fired because CNN has ethics or integrity, or because
[3:37:49.240 --> 3:37:56.520]  they cared. They got fired because they committed fabrication. And let's talk about the three
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:38:03.640]  journalists who got fired. One of them had won a Pulitzer Prize. One of them had been nominated
[3:38:03.640 --> 3:38:09.880]  for Pulitzer. They'd come from the New York Times, very prestigious people. That's how
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:17.080]  fake the whole media industrial complex is, or the media pharma complex, as I call it. I've
[3:38:17.080 --> 3:38:22.040]  said that if you work for CNN or the New York Times or Washington Post, here's your legacy.
[3:38:22.760 --> 3:38:28.440]  You bully people who don't have the means to take you on, and you shield products for big pharma.
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:33.240]  That's your legacy. You watched all the president's men. You thought you're going
[3:38:33.240 --> 3:38:39.720]  to be Woodrow and Bernstein. Nope. You are a shield for big pharma. That's your only reason
[3:38:39.720 --> 3:38:45.560]  you exist. Your only legacy will be bullying people and selling drugs to big pharma.
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:53.880]  So think about that. I mean, if Scaramucci had not had the money it took to sue CNN,
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:38:58.360]  if he were just a regular person, they'd destroy his life. Just like CNN tried to destroy the
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:39:03.080]  life of that Reddit user. Some people said the guy was 15. Other people said he's middle-aged.
[3:39:03.080 --> 3:39:09.320]  It doesn't really matter. The guy's a private citizen. CNN sent four private investigators
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:16.360]  to scour his Reddit Facebook to call his family, harass his friends. That's what they would do
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:20.760]  to you. They would crush everybody listening here. If they knew your name, if you're listening
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:29.080]  right now, or if you're watching on Periscope or YouTube or Facebook or infowars.com, if they got
[3:39:29.080 --> 3:39:36.280]  a hold of your name, they would destroy your life. CNN. But CNN is the bullying victim.
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:44.360]  They are valued at $20 billion. There's a merger, a proposed merger right now, as if
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:50.040]  concentration of media ownership isn't a big enough problem. As if it's already not a big
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:57.640]  enough problem that six corporations control 90% of media, 18, 10 times more are going to merge.
[3:39:58.360 --> 3:40:04.360]  CNN, that merger is being valued at $20 million. This year's profits alone at CNN
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:10.280]  estimate to be $1 billion. You sure make a lot more money selling drugs people don't need
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:17.960]  to cure diseases that polluted water costs than you do being honest and truthful. That's why I
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:22.920]  love when they did a hate article on Alex recently, they go, oh, he sells supplements even though you
[3:40:22.920 --> 3:40:26.680]  can buy the same supplements as sprouts and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods and everything and
[3:40:26.680 --> 3:40:33.480]  water filters you can buy everywhere on Amazon. But somehow it's bad for Alex Jones to sell great
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:39.640]  products like DNA force that help people feel better, that help detoxify the body from this
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:46.120]  very polluted world. Somehow it's a problem to have infowarslife.com and sell people products.
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:53.480]  That's bad that you're shilling. How dare you sell supplements to people? How dare you? But hey,
[3:40:53.480 --> 3:40:57.640]  why don't you take this big drug? And why don't you take that drug? And why don't you take this
[3:40:57.640 --> 3:41:00.920]  other drug that will never cure you because big pharma doesn't want to cure diseases?
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:07.880]  They instead want to treat, and of course a lot of its statins have been shown
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:14.120]  to actually cause heart attacks. So a lot of these drugs, and where's the retraction?
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:20.600]  Where's the investigative journalism into statins, STAT, INS? It has now been proved
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:27.000]  that not only are statins not effective for the vast majority of people, most of the studies
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:34.120]  were fabricated or used out of context. But for many people, it can cause heart attacks.
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:41.000]  Wouldn't a real journalist do an expose on that? Where is the CNN feature story?
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:47.560]  Statins, are they really giving you a heart attack? Where's that big special on CNN?
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:52.440]  Statins, they're gonna, they could kill you, man. Well, they're never gonna do that.
[3:41:52.440 --> 3:41:55.960]  That's how fake these people are. They try to act like there are betters,
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:42:03.080]  that there are superiors intellectually morally, when all they do is shield drugs
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:05.800]  that are bad for people. Are they gonna apologize for that fake news now?
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:12.040]  For all those advertisements that they shared and all those checks they cashed, where they shield
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:17.080]  for statins, which we now know are harmful for the vast majority of people.
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:20.920]  Are they gonna issue a retraction? Are they gonna give that money back?
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:24.120]  Are they gonna say, well, we took all those billions of dollars in advertising, we're feeling
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:30.760]  kind of bad, maybe we shouldn't have done it. So why do people treat CNN like anything other
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:36.920]  than what it is? A multinational $20 billion corporate conglomerate, that's all it is.
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:42.760]  If you work for CNN or the Washington Post of the New York Times, which is owned by Carlos Slim,
[3:42:42.760 --> 3:42:48.680]  Washington Post owned by Jeff Bezos, which, you know, I shop a lot at Amazon, so I'm always
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:42:55.720]  conflicted, but I love Amazon. So, you know, Bezos, he gets a lot of money from me in Amazon,
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:42:59.960]  but I don't subscribe to the Washington Post. The point is though, the Washington Post is owned
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:04.840]  by Jeff Bezos, who's a billionaire. The New York Times is owned by Carlos Slim,
[3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:12.280]  oh, not really owned, Politifact. Let's apply the Politifact logic to my statement. I'll often say
[3:43:12.280 --> 3:43:18.440]  the New York Times is owned by Carlos Slim and people go, how dare you say he owns it?
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:24.680]  He's only the largest shareholder who owns 18% or one-fifth of the company. How dare you call him
[3:43:24.680 --> 3:43:30.440]  the owner though, right? They really, that is how this fake news machinery works. They will nitpick
[3:43:30.440 --> 3:43:36.200]  everything we say and not give us any margin for hyperbole, any margin for kind of like getting
[3:43:36.200 --> 3:43:41.320]  the gist of it, right? They won't go, well, you know, they'll go Politifact, fact check. Mike
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:47.480]  Sernovich claimed on Infowars that Carlos Slim's owned the New York Times, false, for Pinocchio's,
[3:43:47.480 --> 3:43:54.280]  liar, liar, pants on fire. He's not the owner. And then they'll bury it in their little analysis.
[3:43:54.280 --> 3:43:59.960]  Well, he's the largest shareholder at 17.5% or 18% or whatever, one-fifth of the company.
[3:44:01.160 --> 3:44:07.400]  So that'll be buried. The headline, they'll say Sernovich lied. But then when Politifact
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:12.920]  themselves go, well, 17 intelligence agencies said that Trump and Russia colluded and it was
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:18.440]  really only four, they're going to go, well, I mean, the gist of it was right. The gist of that,
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:25.880]  I mean, it wasn't 17. We said it was 17, it wasn't. And we're here to tell you that facts matter
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:31.160]  and we're tired of the alternative facts coming from the pro-Trump media universe. Facts matter.
[3:44:31.160 --> 3:44:37.160]  Well, if facts matter and you claim 17 intelligence organizations found collusion,
[3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:42.040]  and it was only four, then you have spread an alternative fact. You have spread a false fact
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:49.560]  on it. But then they go, well, no, it was four, we said 17, but the gist of it is true. The gist
[3:44:49.560 --> 3:44:55.160]  is that, you know, da, da, da, da, da. That's why they're, that's why they're losing too. I mean,
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:44:59.960]  let's look at the ratings right now, you know, because this is why I'm optimistic. Look at me.
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:07.400]  Do I look tired? Do I, I worked every day. I worked every day. Do you see me looking,
[3:45:07.400 --> 3:45:12.040]  I took my daughter for a four mile hike. She's like 20 pounds. First thing in the morning, you know,
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:16.920]  6.30 in the morning, I'm hiking her, you know, oh, it was really only 7.15 in the morning.
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:21.240]  You know, that's what the fake news media would do. Like, well, Cernovich claims,
[3:45:21.240 --> 3:45:25.320]  you know, he hiked his daughter at 6.30. But according to the Instagram timestamp,
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:33.080]  it was actually 7, 7, 18 PM, and he said four miles, but it was actually 3.973. So, you know,
[3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:37.560]  fake news, four Pinocchios, liar, liar, pants on fire, but really got him. Oh, but if we said 17
[3:45:37.560 --> 3:45:42.600]  agencies, you know, determined collusion, but it was only four. Hey man, chill out, bro. Give us
[3:45:42.600 --> 3:45:47.720]  a minute for that out. No, you got to apply the same standard to everybody. The reason I feel so
[3:45:47.720 --> 3:45:52.040]  good though, just like, because I don't take drugs, Megan Kelly tried to accuse Alex Jones of taking
[3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:58.760]  drugs. That's how, because they have no soul. If you're Megan Kelly, you know, because I've been
[3:45:58.760 --> 3:46:03.080]  in the Infowars people, everybody enjoys their jobs. Don't get me wrong, the job's a job, even
[3:46:03.080 --> 3:46:08.840]  if you have a dream job at Infowars. And my job is a dream job. I mean, you're still tired. You
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.760]  still have to deal with BS. It's not like there's no Shangri-La on this world or the next, right?
[3:46:15.800 --> 3:46:21.800]  But the energy at Infowars is contagious, it's palpable. People enjoy what they're doing.
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:28.280]  They go, everybody must be on drugs because Megan Kelly, her heart, isn't into what she's
[3:46:28.280 --> 3:46:35.160]  doing. She knows every day that she wakes up and shaves her face and puts on the eyeliner.
[3:46:36.600 --> 3:46:42.120]  She knows that she's a liar and that she's going to have to, and that doesn't feel good unless
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:46.920]  you're a true sociopath, which I don't think Megan's the true sociopath. I mean, she's like
[3:46:46.920 --> 3:46:52.040]  borderline. She's got to look and she's shaving her face every day in the morning. She's thinking
[3:46:52.040 --> 3:46:56.600]  to herself, you know, I got to look these people in the eye and lie to them. I got to lie to these
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:02.920]  people today. I got to just make things up. I have to shill for warmongers. I have to shill for
[3:47:04.040 --> 3:47:09.320]  I have to shill for warmongers. I have to shill for globalists. I have to shill for people who
[3:47:09.320 --> 3:47:17.080]  want to murder children and for child traffickers. She's got to shill for pedophiles. She has no
[3:47:17.080 --> 3:47:22.040]  energy. She probably has to take a beta blocker and all kinds of drugs because how do you look
[3:47:22.040 --> 3:47:27.640]  people in the eye knowing that you're defending pedophiles? You're defending warmongers. You're
[3:47:27.640 --> 3:47:32.440]  defending child sex traffickers. You're defending the Saudis. You're defending people like John
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:38.040]  Podesta. That's your job. We must all be on drugs because we feel so good all the time,
[3:47:38.040 --> 3:47:43.960]  but I'll tell you why we feel good and why everybody listening should be optimistic about
[3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:51.160]  the future and why we are grateful for you all rolled into one side by side. Paul Joseph Watson
[3:47:51.160 --> 3:48:00.440]  video versus CNN ratings. The highest rated person on CNN is Anderson Cooper. Anderson Cooper does
[3:48:00.440 --> 3:48:09.320]  around 900,000 for his best show, right? Best show and that is not real ratings because they play
[3:48:09.320 --> 3:48:14.200]  in the airport. If you got CNN kicked out of the airports and kicked out of our public schools,
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:21.960]  they would have maybe 100,000 viewers. Once you factor in Paul's Facebook and factor in Paul's
[3:48:21.960 --> 3:48:30.360]  YouTube, 3 million views a day. These are just brand new videos of Paul, 713,000, 400,000,
[3:48:30.360 --> 3:48:39.480]  451,000, 700,000, 600,000. These are his Twitter views. Paul's Twitter is doing like 250 million
[3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:48.520]  views a month, right? His videos are doing millions of views on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:56.440]  consistently. I had a video going after CNN in a meme compilation. It's already reached 10 million
[3:48:56.440 --> 3:48:59.640]  people. We have the screen cap from the face because of fake news meetings. I'm like, well,
[3:49:00.680 --> 3:49:07.480]  BS, baloney, you know, liars. 10 million viewers. I'll see if I can pull up the screen cap here
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:12.200]  on my phone or whatever and show you guys. Myfacebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich. We
[3:49:12.200 --> 3:49:17.880]  post a lot of videos there and great memes and other kind of stuff. I'll show you. It has done
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:28.680]  4.2 million views already and it's reached over 10 million people. They can call me. They can
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:34.200]  throw a fit all they want. You can look at the analytics. One video alone, 4.2 million views,
[3:49:34.200 --> 3:49:42.760]  it's reached 10 million 41,000 people. My video is for one week alone. Facebook.com forward slash
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:58.040]  Mike Cernovich. 10 million 247,000. Over 10 million views from Facebook. 16,698,000 people reached
[3:49:58.040 --> 3:50:04.280]  on my Facebook, right? That is why they're freaking out. They don't do ratings like that at CNN.
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:10.600]  And Paul's Facebook probably way bigger than mine. I don't have his analytics, but I mean, Paul's
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:15.640]  owns the video space, right? So Paul Joseph Watson, Paul are great. His Facebook is killing it.
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:19.400]  His Twitter is killing it. His YouTube is killing it. That is why I'm optimistic and that is why

[3:54:19.480 --> 3:54:25.800]  Final segment, we're going to talk about some, you know, we win, but the fight is on every day.
[3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:32.040]  Very disturbing news coming out of the State Department, a key official in the State Department.
[3:54:32.040 --> 3:54:36.920]  And we've talked about this before, by the way, I broke a story with Alex, I believe a week ago.
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:43.400]  We talked about Rex Tillerson, Margaret Petterlin and Brian Hook and how they're trying to take
[3:54:43.400 --> 3:54:49.480]  the State Department and completely frustrate the American first policy goals. They want to
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:55.800]  turn it into another, you know, deep state operation. So there's now a McCain shill, very,
[3:54:55.800 --> 3:55:01.240]  very high level position given to the State Department. That story just broke earlier
[3:55:01.240 --> 3:55:06.920]  today. Reason.com has the article and, you know, they're pulling it up right now. So
[3:55:07.800 --> 3:55:13.960]  this guy is, I mean, John McCain is, as you know, one of the worst people in the Senate,
[3:55:13.960 --> 3:55:21.080]  maybe the worst in terms of, in terms of pure evil of senators of all time, probably the most
[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:26.200]  evil senator of all time at Hilary Hillary Clinton, John McCain would be number two. I mean, he might
[3:55:26.200 --> 3:55:31.160]  be number one. There are pictures of him with ISIS and all kinds of terrorist founders. He,
[3:55:31.160 --> 3:55:35.720]  he'd been a bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran. He was trying to sing a song about, you know,
[3:55:35.720 --> 3:55:39.320]  bombing people and murdering civilians and things like that. There's footage of that everywhere you
[3:55:39.320 --> 3:55:44.680]  want to go. He's just a ball of rage. And he's actually gone senile now. I've heard from exclusive
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:51.640]  reports that he, um, he's no longer, he's no longer himself, so to speak. And, and of course,
[3:55:51.640 --> 3:55:58.600]  we saw that clip of him during the, I believe it was the Komi hearing. One of the hearings he
[3:55:58.600 --> 3:56:03.880]  showed the dementia setting in where he couldn't form a coherent sentence, couldn't form a coherent
[3:56:03.880 --> 3:56:09.800]  thought. He blamed it on staying up late, watching the Arizona Diamondbacks. So yeah, John McCain,
[3:56:09.800 --> 3:56:15.640]  we can report is having severe health problems. Early onset, um, Alzheimer's is what I've heard.
[3:56:16.280 --> 3:56:20.120]  So I'm trying to get ahold of medical records, of course, but just like, just like, you know,
[3:56:20.120 --> 3:56:25.480]  we had Hilary Parkinson's, the fake news media say, Oh, how dare you say that? No, he has dementia
[3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:31.560]  for sure. So we are calling on John McCain to release his health records. He, he was, the media
[3:56:31.560 --> 3:56:36.600]  made him release it during the presidential campaign. Cause remember health records were,
[3:56:37.480 --> 3:56:41.640]  health records were not off. Here we go. Concerns about John McCain's health after Komi hearing.
[3:56:42.600 --> 3:56:49.000]  He's utterly coherent. He does have Alzheimer's disease. And as we know, when he ran for president
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:56.280]  against Obama, hey man, health was on limits. Everybody in the media demanded to see his
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:57:00.600]  medical records. But then when we asked for Hilary Clinton's records, no, no, no, what are you doing?
[3:57:00.600 --> 3:57:05.240]  You can't ask for health records. How dare you? So that's what the fake news media is going to
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:10.680]  say now. They're going to say, Oh, Cernvich claimed that John McCain has Alzheimer's. Well,
[3:57:10.680 --> 3:57:15.960]  you can't say that. You can't show the health records. The same people who eight years ago,
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:19.640]  we're dominating to see McCain's records are now going to say, we can't look at them anymore.
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:26.280]  Isn't that interesting how that works? How they, they change the rules to fit whatever they want
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:31.960]  to do. They have no integrity. That is why people don't trust the fake news media. That is why people
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:36.760]  don't trust CNN, New York Times, WAPO. And that is why, you know, the Harvard Business Review
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:42.520]  has to do a whole special. They're freaking out. You know, I feel bad. I gave $20 to the globalist
[3:57:42.520 --> 3:57:47.560]  war machine. I'm going to have to off, you know how Al Gore offsets his purchases, like carbon
[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:52.280]  credits, even less a scam. Don't get me down that, you know, rabbit hole right now. But whatever,
[3:57:52.280 --> 3:57:58.920]  this was 1895. So whenever I give 1895 to a globalist organization, then I go to infowarster.com
[3:57:58.920 --> 3:58:03.800]  and have to buy a product or something to offset. It's like the, the right wing offset, right? We
[3:58:03.800 --> 3:58:09.240]  need, we need to offset all of our bad purchases with, with good ones. So yeah, McCain's having
[3:58:09.240 --> 3:58:14.680]  problems. The globalists are freaking out. There's going to be a big CFR sponsored hit piece on me.
[3:58:14.680 --> 3:58:19.720]  There's actually somebody who monitors every transmission on info wars who works with an
[3:58:19.720 --> 3:58:23.240]  intelligence agency. I'm not going to tell you which one because I'm knocking out my source.
[3:58:23.240 --> 3:58:27.720]  We are being monitored. We are being watched. If you want to learn more about me, you can go to
