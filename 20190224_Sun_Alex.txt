[00:00.000 --> 00:27.320]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.320 --> 00:35.760]  Sunday, February 24, 2019. I am your embattled host, Alex Jones. We're making history again
[00:35.760 --> 00:40.280]  here today just by being on the air. I want to thank you all for spreading the word about
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.560]  the broadcast. That's how we cut through censorship. I'm going to go to a special report right
[00:45.560 --> 00:52.680]  up front dealing with the total and complete demonization of Christian schools in this
[00:52.680 --> 00:58.000]  country and the organized bullying of Christians taking place on Twitter and other globalist
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.200]  platforms. We're going to be going to that report here in just a moment. When we come
[01:02.200 --> 01:08.880]  back, Trump is going for the second big summit. We're going to look at that, the dangers,
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.480]  also the positives. Actually, the BBC did a half-decent job coming out with a headline.
[01:14.480 --> 01:22.480]  Are we on the road to civilizational collapse? They go on to say civilizations don't really
[01:22.480 --> 01:26.360]  die by being murdered, they die by committing suicide, and the globalists are just doing
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.360]  that by design. We'll cover it all, but first, here's John Bowne's report.
[01:30.360 --> 01:36.520]  That's make America great again. A bunch of child molesters. That's right. Dirty-ass
[01:36.520 --> 01:43.240]  crackers behind you with a red, with a red, make America great head again on. A bunch
[01:43.240 --> 01:51.080]  of incest babies. A bunch of babies made out of incest. That's right. Here come Gad. Here
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.400]  come Gad. Here come Gad.
[01:55.400 --> 02:01.320]  Nick Sandman, that now famous Covington, Kentucky teen that stood his ground and remained calm
[02:01.320 --> 02:06.640]  in the face of leftist lunacy, has a legal team filing hundreds of lawsuits against the
[02:06.640 --> 02:12.400]  media mob and celebrities that denigrated his family, his school, his fellow classmates,
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.080]  and himself for merely being a supporter of the sitting president and being at the wrong
[02:17.080 --> 02:23.200]  place at the wrong time. The Washington Post faces a $250 million judgment and more are
[02:23.200 --> 02:28.240]  to quickly follow for defamation on a scale that can only be attributed to mental illness
[02:28.240 --> 02:35.120]  or Trump derangement syndrome. You would expect that the mainstream media would be responsible
[02:35.120 --> 02:43.680]  enough to pause, recognize they're dealing with a student, investigate, and make sure
[02:43.680 --> 02:50.520]  that they have the facts accurate, that the story that they tell is accurate. But they
[02:50.520 --> 02:56.440]  didn't pause when it came to Nicholas because they wanted to rush out and they wanted to
[02:56.440 --> 03:03.240]  jump into the mob, give the mob a megaphone so that they could attack this boy because
[03:03.240 --> 03:08.920]  he was white, he was Catholic, and he was wearing a make America great head cap. If
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.200]  Nicholas had not purchased that souvenir cap that day at the mall, if he was not wearing
[03:14.200 --> 03:20.200]  it, none of us would know who Nicholas Sandman is. The millennial Twitter hordes who recently
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.920]  targeted an Austin, Texas kid for selling hot chocolate to support President Trump's
[03:25.920 --> 03:30.320]  border wall. As against helping Donald Trump and then I saw the state of the union address
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.600]  and I wanted to help him. He just said, Dad, I want to do a stand to help Trump raise money
[03:35.600 --> 03:40.160]  for the wall. Some people are mad and calling me a little hitler and stuff and then some
[03:40.160 --> 03:46.000]  people are really happy. We are obviously conservative so we have certain news stations
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.920]  on and he hears what we talk about at the dinner table. Somehow it's gotten skewed to
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.000]  think that we're teaching our son to hate and I don't understand where that comes from.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.160]  I like all people. I think it's important that they know what's going on in the world,
[04:01.160 --> 04:06.320]  where we stand, what we believe in. After the local CBS affiliate posted the report
[04:06.320 --> 04:11.240]  to their Twitter feed, the mob piled on, posting a child being thrown off a cliff, another
[04:11.240 --> 04:16.160]  being thrown into a fire and another posted a wrestler destroying a kid in his living
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.320]  room, a public celebration of child abuse. The moronic millennial horde called for the
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.440]  kid and his parents to be fined for not having a permit, which he didn't need, also for his
[04:26.440 --> 04:32.000]  parents to be arrested. All of this on the local CBS affiliate's Twitter page. Twitter
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.880]  allows threats of violence of children from leftist mobs, regardless of their supposed
[04:37.880 --> 04:44.080]  rules. The sad truth, millennials aren't really to blame. They've been indoctrinated by a
[04:44.080 --> 04:50.280]  scourge of Marxist anti-American reeducation that has total control of the American school
[04:50.280 --> 04:56.400]  system from the bottom up. Suckered into trading their individual freedoms for temporary
[04:56.400 --> 05:02.440]  triggers, harboring pseudo-sycophantic ideals that only exist. The globalists know that
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.240]  if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[05:06.240 --> 05:12.200]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.240]  down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[05:17.240 --> 05:22.400]  we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[05:22.400 --> 05:26.760]  but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we
[05:26.760 --> 05:32.040]  discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[05:32.040 --> 05:37.280]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[05:37.280 --> 05:42.000]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.320]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen,
[05:54.320 --> 05:59.160]  you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available
[05:59.160 --> 06:26.640]  at InfoLife.com.
[06:29.480 --> 06:37.920]  We have mass mental illness spreading across the board. And I don't say that to be negative,
[06:37.920 --> 06:43.360]  I say it to address a problem like, the house is on fire, let's put it out, or at least
[06:43.360 --> 06:47.640]  get out of it before it kills us. But you know, we haven't been able to get off this
[06:47.640 --> 06:53.880]  planet yet as a species, so we've got to save the house. It is Sunday, the 24th of February
[06:53.880 --> 07:04.480]  2019. I'm Alex Jones, your host, infowars.com, newswars.com are the news sites. The enemy
[07:04.480 --> 07:09.680]  works around the clock to make sure people aren't able to go and see and hear. They can't
[07:09.680 --> 07:17.120]  stop you when you take action, so please don't forget that.
[07:17.120 --> 07:20.120]  The first thing I want to just mention is something I'm going to cover at the bottom
[07:20.120 --> 07:27.800]  of the hour in some detail. And that's, the BBC does a half-decent job pulling us out,
[07:27.800 --> 07:32.640]  but then of course their solutions are set up by the planetary government and bring in
[07:32.640 --> 07:41.240]  more tyranny to the societal fact that they point out that is accurate. Are we on the
[07:41.240 --> 07:47.920]  road to civilizational collapse? Great civilizations are not murdered, instead they take their
[07:47.920 --> 07:56.920]  own lives. And that ties in with biblical locus plague set to hit Egypt. We're going
[07:56.920 --> 08:04.800]  to look at both those articles. And the good news is Trump, North Korea, Barate failed
[08:04.800 --> 08:09.840]  Democrats ahead of Vietnam summit. You know, I'll give Trump this. He's bold to try to
[08:09.840 --> 08:14.080]  get denuclearization. He's bold to try to cut shine out of the equation that's basically
[08:14.080 --> 08:21.080]  helped keep North Korea as a Stalinist hermit state. And it's a big gamble because the globalists
[08:21.080 --> 08:26.680]  don't want peace over in that area of the world. It's part of a larger global strategic
[08:26.680 --> 08:35.400]  plan to use North Korea as a detonator for a wider global war. But just knowing the instincts
[08:35.400 --> 08:42.120]  of an evil communist regime that's been so incredibly oppressive, I don't see how they
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.680]  will ever let Kim Jong-un even try to denuclearize, even though the U.S. is ready to come in just
[08:48.680 --> 08:55.000]  like Japan at the end of World War II or South Korea and totally rebuild the thing.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.560]  And no doubt it'd be an economic juggernaut within a decade. But can you get in Prince
[09:02.560 --> 09:07.600]  really evil bureaucracies to stop that? The difference is the U.S. dropped atomic bombs
[09:07.600 --> 09:14.560]  on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese power structure finally capitulated. And then
[09:14.560 --> 09:23.920]  they can be reorganized. Do you really think North Korea's going to do that? I hope the
[09:23.920 --> 09:30.120]  President's right. I hope he can pull it off. One thing's for sure, he's bold. He's going
[09:30.120 --> 09:36.040]  to be there Wednesday. He leaves tomorrow. We'll have nonstop coverage here on air, ladies
[09:36.040 --> 09:43.520]  and gentlemen. And we do have some big surprises this week, big, big, big, big surprises about
[09:43.520 --> 09:53.360]  as big as you can get on this show. So look for that. Wednesday is a key day. I will not
[09:53.360 --> 10:01.160]  be in town. I will be on air, though. And so I'll just leave it at that for you. So
[10:01.160 --> 10:06.440]  I want to stay with us throughout the week. This show is 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. You
[10:06.440 --> 10:10.320]  have David Knight and the David Knight show before me, 8 a.m. every morning to 11 a.m.
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.920]  to where you have Owen Schreuer and the War Room. I also have an update on Roger Stone.
[10:15.920 --> 10:21.280]  Roger Stone, since he got completely gagged, we can't talk about anybody that's even in
[10:21.280 --> 10:26.600]  the case, Mueller, Trump, anybody has not talked to me. I talked to some of the folks that
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.600]  were in the courtroom. They said, no, it was all about info wars. And the judge and people
[10:30.600 --> 10:37.080]  were interested in trying to shut you up. So that shows you how the authoritarian cancer
[10:37.080 --> 10:43.240]  has seriously grown in this nation. Now, those of us that have been effective at exposing
[10:43.240 --> 10:51.360]  it are under the greatest level of time. But then there's other stories that are just so
[10:51.360 --> 10:59.160]  illustrative of perception versus reality. And one of those is Russiagate. You've got
[10:59.160 --> 11:05.640]  Jeannie Ray, one of the main prosecutors in the whole Russiagate fiasco, the Inquisition,
[11:05.640 --> 11:14.500]  the witch hunt on steroids, the fraud. The red scare for real, what the left claimed
[11:14.500 --> 11:18.960]  happened to them is now happening to nationalists. But it's not a commie scare. It's a Russia
[11:18.960 --> 11:29.600]  scare. I read Paul Manafort, a hardened and bold criminal Mueller prosecutors tell judge.
[11:29.600 --> 11:36.720]  And it's Jeannie Ray with the laptop media all there. That's Hillary Clinton's chief
[11:36.720 --> 11:42.560]  lawyer from her foundation who was openly involved in all of this massive uranium one
[11:42.560 --> 11:45.920]  stuff. Do you imagine Roger Stone is going to be in these trials and other people are
[11:45.920 --> 11:53.640]  in these trials? And you've got Hillary's flying monkey, Hillary's minion. I mean, she's
[11:53.640 --> 11:59.800]  got this whole army of flying monkeys. She's got David Brock and she's got Michael Moore
[11:59.800 --> 12:07.480]  and she's got Mueller and she's got Jeannie Ray. But I mean, this is Hillary's total
[12:07.480 --> 12:19.640]  servant herself up to her eyeballs in Russia. And then Roger's not supposed to talk about
[12:19.640 --> 12:26.000]  it. And you know, Roger made a big mistake with his lawyers. I've talked to other lawyers.
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.560]  They agree. He has some factoid thing. He's got Coke bottle glasses. The guy's based
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.360]  like a mole. He's a nice guy. He's a smart guy. He's blind. Can't see it from his face.
[12:36.360 --> 12:46.680]  Can't read menus. He's got glasses that are, I'm not going to exaggerate. Over a quarter
[12:46.680 --> 12:52.560]  an inch thick, the definition of Coke bottle glasses. He literally has to sit there at
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.000]  a menu and just can't even read it, ask you what's on it. So he posts something with her
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.120]  and it's got Celtic crosses on it off with data points up the side on arena. Oh, I'm
[13:04.120 --> 13:09.080]  so sorry, your honor. It's so horrible what I did. His lawyers, it's unconscionable what
[13:09.080 --> 13:15.880]  he did. She goes, I agree. You say one more word about anything. You're going to prison.
[13:15.880 --> 13:24.400]  And everyone then rolls over and pees on themselves. So Mr. McGoo, that's his code name. That's
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.280]  what his wife calls him. And of course he likes to act like he's the James Bonzi guy.
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.920]  And he's a smart guy, but no, he's Mr. McGoo. He had to look really carefully when he goes
[13:33.920 --> 13:38.080]  downstairs. I'm trying to be mean here. It's true. But I'm sure when I'm 60 something
[13:38.080 --> 13:43.520]  my eyes are nice. I have 2015 vision, not even 2020 now. I have trouble in a dark restaurant
[13:43.520 --> 13:53.440]  reading a menu. So my point is, is that notice none of the media at the New York Times showed
[13:53.440 --> 13:59.640]  you what he did. And that was cropped with the judge and then a little Celtic cross up
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.120]  here in the corner with some, you know, lines of data out to the side. Now scroll down and
[14:05.120 --> 14:09.800]  show folks. So, so that's what's going on. And enough about Roger. It's just, it's just
[14:09.800 --> 14:15.840]  the climate in this country. And then to talk to some of the reporters that were there and
[14:15.840 --> 14:19.400]  then they call me the next day and they go, sorry, I can't even talk to you now. They're
[14:19.400 --> 14:25.680]  saying it's anybody in Roger's orbit can't ever talk. You know, that's not the order.
[14:25.680 --> 14:31.600]  And they're talking about gagging you. Well, of course they are my God. But one thing that's
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.000]  going to happen is I'm not going to kiss that corrupt judge's ash, that dirty filthy criminal.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.360]  I'll get up in front of her and tell her she's a filthy criminal judges that have a good
[14:40.360 --> 14:45.720]  record. I'll respect them. I respect her judicial system, the Bill of Rights Constitution,
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.520]  the three branches of government. I want America back, but she covered up Benghazi. She covers
[14:50.520 --> 14:56.120]  up with all this corruption, illegal spying and all this crap. She's an un-American threat
[14:56.120 --> 15:02.040]  to this country. She's a judicial tyrant, just like the Nazi judges. I'll never kiss
[15:02.040 --> 15:09.120]  her ass ever. I'm not involved in Russians. You are. But Jeannie Ray and Hillary, you're
[15:09.120 --> 15:16.600]  covering up the real threat. You're the threat to America. So get that, you damn pipe and
[15:16.600 --> 15:24.840]  smoke it. All of you. These damn people are on TV saying we're going to kill your babies
[15:24.840 --> 15:28.880]  after they're born. And I got stacks of news where they're going to teach five-year-olds
[15:28.880 --> 15:34.440]  now. They're another sex in mainline schools. They're coming for everything. And if you
[15:34.440 --> 15:38.960]  want to roll over and kiss their ass and run a big old stinkin' white flag up, you sure
[15:38.960 --> 15:47.280]  as hell got the go-ahead. Because it's a free, well, universe. But as for me, accelerate
[15:47.280 --> 15:55.800]  the ramming speed. Put on all fuel. Prepare for impact. This is war. And I love it. Yeah.
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.800]  Yes, yes.
[15:59.800 --> 16:06.080]  At Info Wars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products

[18:00.600 --> 18:05.920]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.920 --> 18:11.120]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:11.120 --> 18:17.960]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.960 --> 18:23.800]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.800 --> 18:29.200]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[18:29.200 --> 18:34.600]  trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[18:34.600 --> 18:40.800]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[18:40.800 --> 18:45.360]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[18:45.360 --> 18:50.640]  blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[18:50.640 --> 18:57.000]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.120]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. If you're not expanding, you're
[19:02.120 --> 19:07.280]  imploding. There is no set stasis. There is no managed system. There is no uncontenuums.
[19:07.280 --> 19:12.440]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future. So, you support us and get
[19:12.440 --> 19:15.960]  creative and get fired up. We won't just be here 100 years. We'll be here forever. We'll
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.680]  turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows
[19:20.680 --> 19:25.160]  what, are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here. We made it. And that's
[19:25.160 --> 19:29.800]  really where this goes. God's got a big war for you, Reddy. And so, if you can't face
[19:29.800 --> 19:33.840]  George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really
[19:33.840 --> 19:38.560]  be able to face the other stuff? Because God wants warriors that are smart and ready to
[19:38.560 --> 19:42.360]  build things and are also ready to fight. You don't go to the next level without getting
[19:42.360 --> 19:45.040]  a big weight put on your back. And, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me
[19:45.040 --> 19:49.760]  in the future. I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built. I want to go
[19:49.760 --> 19:55.040]  to the next level. I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[19:55.040 --> 20:03.080]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb. I want life. I want Jesus.
[20:03.080 --> 20:26.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.760 --> 20:33.960]  And deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's
[20:33.960 --> 20:51.440]  Alex Jones. You know, used to be three years ago, seems like five million years ago, that
[20:51.440 --> 20:57.760]  you would have a video once a month or so of somebody wearing a Make America Great Again
[20:57.760 --> 21:03.840]  hat getting hit over the head with a baseball bat or stabbed or hit the head with a bike
[21:03.840 --> 21:10.560]  lock or eggs thrown in their face or beat up. Now there's so many of these four or five
[21:10.560 --> 21:17.760]  a day, a couple of days become national news that I can't even watch them all to keep track.
[21:17.760 --> 21:21.320]  And you'll, somebody will be in a restaurant, somebody will be at a college, somebody will
[21:21.320 --> 21:25.880]  be walking down the street and somebody just walks over super arrogant and punches you
[21:25.880 --> 21:29.960]  right in the face or dumps hot coffee on your head. It's happened to me just for being
[21:29.960 --> 21:35.320]  Alex Jones. And the thing is, then they'll go brag the cops. They always get arrested
[21:35.320 --> 21:41.840]  now because we're like, yeah, I did it. He deserves it. It's like some of those women
[21:41.840 --> 21:44.840]  that came out and admitted that they just lied, never met Kavanaugh. I never raped
[21:44.840 --> 21:50.280]  him. They go, but he's Kavanaugh. I mean, he's a bad guy. I mean, he is a rapist. Balazi
[21:50.280 --> 21:55.240]  said it. So I wanted to support him. Well, no, Balazi story was fake as well. Balazi
[21:55.240 --> 22:02.920]  Ford, little mess CIA sunshine. You notice she's disappeared off the radar. All these
[22:02.920 --> 22:16.120]  failed attempts at hoaxing. Just like horse face. A horse is a horse. Of course, of course,
[22:16.120 --> 22:22.720]  that is of course, unless the horse is the famous Mrs. Stormy Daniels. You don't hear
[22:22.720 --> 22:30.640]  about her. Abinadi. Oh, Abinadi said he got Michael Cohen's IRS records from a random
[22:30.640 --> 22:35.720]  private person. No, you can't get those. He got them from an IRS agent. They raided the
[22:35.720 --> 22:42.520]  guy, of course, a few days ago. And turns out he is a vicious anti-trumper, of course.
[22:42.520 --> 22:47.520]  That's what we've got to a certain extent in the federal government in those key areas
[22:47.520 --> 22:53.640]  at the IRS, where Lois Lerner taught us that you persecute Christians. You persecute conservatives.
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.640]  You don't just punch them in the face as they exercise their free speech. No, no, no, no,
[22:57.640 --> 23:01.200]  no. You teach their five-year-old sons how to be girls, and their five-year-old daughters
[23:01.200 --> 23:06.200]  how to be boys. You teach them how to get on Prozac and Ritalin, and you teach them how
[23:06.200 --> 23:11.640]  America was never great and how to never be great. And then that's what you do. So I've
[23:11.640 --> 23:17.720]  got all of these clips I want to get to, but let's just go ahead and start with AOC, Ms.
[23:17.720 --> 23:23.000]  Cortez. Before I get to these new clips, I thought I'd play some of the previous clips,
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.840]  the last, you know, Diane Feinstein also, that's coming up. AOC claims the world will
[23:28.840 --> 23:36.720]  end in 12 years unless we act to prevent climate change. How is that not terrorizing people?
[23:36.720 --> 23:41.640]  How is that not terrorizing young people? And how many pizza places have you been in?
[23:41.640 --> 23:45.760]  Or how many school plays have you gone to? How many times have you been around children's
[23:45.760 --> 23:51.440]  artwork? And it shows a penguin and a polar bear, they tell them to do in class, and they
[23:51.440 --> 23:57.000]  tell them in the class, worldwide, UNESCO curriculum, show penguins and polar bears
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.440]  that are going to drown because the ice caps are melting. Well, the ice caps every year
[24:02.440 --> 24:08.120]  in the Arctic and Antarctic summers get smaller, and they get bigger in the Arctic and Antarctic
[24:08.120 --> 24:13.880]  winters that are reversed. But they show you penguins and say they can't swim. They're
[24:13.880 --> 24:18.960]  one of the best swimming birds on the planet. Polar bears can swim 300 miles. They hunt
[24:18.960 --> 24:25.000]  on ice packs, out to 300 miles and swim back hunting beluga whale. But see, it doesn't matter.
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.560]  They show kids, look at the polar bear, type in polar bears, global warming, just click
[24:29.560 --> 24:33.400]  Google images. Yes, it's the same. There you go. It's always the image of a polar bear
[24:33.400 --> 24:40.000]  on a piece of ice. And you think, oh, it's not aquatic. It can't swim. Oh my God, no.
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.520]  It's hiding up there to kill whales. It's so strong, type in polar bear killing beluga
[24:47.520 --> 24:55.200]  that it can haul in what a 1,500 pound beluga with one arm. Boy, that's a tough animal.
[24:55.200 --> 25:04.000]  One arm fishes up an entire whale and eats it. Yes, they can swim in subzero water. A
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.600]  lot of idiots will go, oh, why is it subzero? Be ice. No, salt water doesn't freeze as
[25:07.600 --> 25:13.240]  easy as fresh water. I'm digressing. The point is, is that how many times you've seen the
[25:13.240 --> 25:18.120]  photo of a penguin on top of an ice flow and they say, shave the penguins. They're about
[25:18.120 --> 25:23.360]  to drown. It's a fricking aquatic bird. It hobbles around on the ground. It shoots like
[25:23.360 --> 25:30.640]  a torpedo to the water. Well, I think some penguins can go like 50 miles an hour. Look
[25:30.640 --> 25:40.240]  up maximum speed of penguins, please. But, but listen, I'm digressing. I'm digressing.
[25:40.240 --> 25:43.680]  I shot a report on this years ago. We could pull it up. They'd lead my YouTube channel.
[25:43.680 --> 25:54.160]  I was a reporter in Texas, Texas at the pizza place there and they had over 50 elementary
[25:54.160 --> 26:03.400]  school students. Well, that's that's on land. 5.6. It's it's how fast is the penguin swim?
[26:03.400 --> 26:09.560]  How fast can the fastest penguin swim? Penguins are aquatic. They sleep on land. They live
[26:09.560 --> 26:17.960]  in the water. It's a aquatic bird. I'm digressing. They swim like this. 22 miles an hour. I saw
[26:17.960 --> 26:22.200]  something at top speeds of 15, but whatever. 20 miles an hour. So continuing there. See
[26:22.200 --> 26:28.480]  my memory fell. That's not 3.5 miles an hour. You know, I'm already digressing here. This
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.640]  is this is this even matter. The point is, is that they show you penguins and say they're
[26:33.640 --> 26:40.320]  all going to die. And Al Gore does PowerPoint showing polar bears saying, Oh, oh, but it
[26:40.320 --> 26:46.360]  gets better. They want it outlawed. If you deny manmade global warming, well, everybody
[26:46.360 --> 26:52.400]  knows that things get hot, things get cold. The only constant is change. So they change
[26:52.400 --> 26:58.360]  it to climate change. No, we're not denying climate changes. We're saying that anthropogenic
[26:58.360 --> 27:04.680]  or manmade is a very, very tiny amount and real science shows that. But the less always
[27:04.680 --> 27:09.200]  a weak control science, you don't. And you're making things up. And you're the ones that
[27:09.200 --> 27:15.280]  say that there are only 100 genders and there are no men, there are no women and a man can
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.800]  with genitals male genitals can be a woman. No, you're the ones that are against science.
[27:18.800 --> 27:24.600]  Okay. So coming up, we have this video of them brainwashing a bunch of little kids before
[27:24.600 --> 27:30.440]  they go in to try to push Diane Feinstein to give us more carbon taxes and shut down,
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.040]  of course, only our economy. But as we go out to break, though, I thought we'd first
[27:36.040 --> 27:42.680]  just you place some of her oldies, but our goodies where AOC says that we'll be all dead
[27:42.680 --> 27:46.960]  in 12 years, not from nuclear war. That's a possibility. Not from bio weapons. That's
[27:46.960 --> 27:52.680]  a possibility. Not from an asteroid, but she says from global climate change. Here she
[27:52.680 --> 28:05.360]  is. And I think that the part of it that is generational is that millennials and people
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.840]  and you know, Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like,
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.000]  the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest
[28:16.000 --> 28:26.240]  issue is your your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it? And like this is the
[28:26.240 --> 28:34.680]  war. This is our world war two. Well, they've inflated the Venezuelan currency massively.
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.760]  They just can't imagine we pay for it all ding dong. But it's okay. You sit here in
[28:39.760 --> 28:44.320]  the sports left the space base, the US bitching about it. You want to be here. You want to
[28:44.320 --> 28:50.680]  bitch about it all day when you're as dumb as a box of rocks. You are the epitome of
[28:50.680 --> 29:01.000]  a moron. Now we come back. He's got new insane statements where she's the boss and more getting

[33:33.640 --> 33:46.280]  studio. It's Alex Jones. So, back in the day, man bear pig was half man, half bear, half
[33:46.280 --> 33:54.920]  pig. He said in 2003, but all the scientific studies show, my outgoer is not that good
[33:54.920 --> 34:05.440]  of an imitation. But by 2013, all the coastal cities of the world will be completely flooded.
[34:05.440 --> 34:11.360]  They probably bought a house right on the beach in California. But at least he just
[34:11.360 --> 34:20.480]  said all the cities would be flooded. And 10, 11 years later, of course, it didn't happen.
[34:20.480 --> 34:30.720]  But now, AOC, so we're always going to say her whole name, like she's royalty. Imagine
[34:30.720 --> 34:38.800]  if I'm Alexander Emrick Jones. Well, you know Alexander Emrick Jones says, well, you know
[34:38.800 --> 34:55.480]  Alexander Emrick Jones or other people's full names like, well, Patrick J. Riley says. So,
[34:55.480 --> 35:04.240]  she's the perfect anglerfish light. Alexandria Lordship Cortez is not really a person. She's
[35:04.240 --> 35:12.760]  one of those deep sea fish that lures in other phosphorescent luminous fish with that light
[35:12.760 --> 35:22.080]  that looks like it's a juicy, luminous shrimp. But really, it's hiding the floating, swimming
[35:22.080 --> 35:29.720]  mouth, the self-propelled stomach that's about to eat you. And so AOC is the, you know, like
[35:29.720 --> 35:35.160]  that's an ugly light. No, it's a meth mouth, small brain light. But you have to understand
[35:35.160 --> 35:39.560]  she's like, everyone gets free everything and reparations. All the black people doesn't
[35:39.560 --> 35:44.080]  matter of almost all the white people in the U.S. had ancestors that didn't have slaves.
[35:44.080 --> 35:49.440]  And most white people came here after slavery. It doesn't matter. All of you have to pay.
[35:49.440 --> 35:57.960]  They're like, if your dad committed arm robbery, like 50 years later, you go to jail. But she's
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.400]  out there. Oh, of course, Elizabeth Warren doubled down. She made up being Native Americans.
[36:01.400 --> 36:04.480]  She goes, well, let me kiss their butt because they're all after me. You know, the major
[36:04.480 --> 36:08.920]  tribal groups have a fraud. Let me say, oh, the Native Americans, you all deserve some
[36:08.920 --> 36:16.360]  reparations too. Well, they're already getting money on the reservations and it's ruined
[36:16.360 --> 36:23.000]  most of their lives. But it's a side issue. I'm really digressing here today. I got so
[36:23.000 --> 36:36.640]  much news to get. But AOC, Alexandria method Cortez, and I'm not saying she's a method.
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.280]  I'm just saying if I was going to cast somebody for a new season of Breaking Bad, that's like
[36:41.280 --> 36:47.440]  a crack whore method. She'd be it. But I'm not saying Brian Stelter looks like someone
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.440]  that eats children. Well, I'm not saying he does eat children. I'm saying he does look
[36:51.440 --> 36:55.800]  like he's the type of creature like they could cast him for the next hit the clown. There
[36:55.800 --> 37:01.280]  would be no makeup needed. Like if I was walking down a dark alley at night and he turned a
[37:01.280 --> 37:07.680]  flashlight on under his face, I would projectile defecate my pants. And I'm sorry to be gross
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.960]  here. I would actually there's few things that horrify me. But when you have discernment,
[37:11.960 --> 37:19.960]  Brian Stelter is the true face of demonic evil. Oh my gosh, so evil. So sorry. I'm
[37:19.960 --> 37:25.040]  not saying he's a child molester. I'm saying he looks like a child molester who could deny
[37:25.040 --> 37:36.240]  he looks like a big fat creeper van driver. Let's go further. AOC looks like a crack whore.
[37:36.240 --> 37:41.360]  But what we do know about the woman that looks like a crack whore is that she's evil. She's
[37:41.360 --> 37:50.920]  a liar. And she's stupid. And she's arrogant. And she's bad. Now let's expand on it. And
[37:50.920 --> 37:59.060]  meth's a bad thing. She's got meth mouth. Her muscles are desiccated. But it's a hard
[37:59.060 --> 38:05.920]  job working for the angler fish. Chucky Schumer. That's what she is. She's a she's an angler
[38:05.920 --> 38:12.120]  fish for Chucky who sits back. He's like, Hey, yes, I'm Chucky Schumer. I'm sorry.
[38:12.120 --> 38:20.560]  Let me get serious. Let's give these clips. So she now taunts green new deal critics saying
[38:20.560 --> 38:30.120]  I'm the boss. How about that? Now, if she wasn't such an idiot and such a moron and
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.040]  it had more successes in her life, except being given everything, including the designer
[38:34.040 --> 38:39.760]  outfit she wears, that might actually work. But she's like somebody wearing the biggest
[38:39.760 --> 38:48.120]  cowboy hat you ever saw who's never seen a horse or a cow. But this is who they are.
[38:48.120 --> 38:54.160]  This is who they bring you up there promising. We don't need budgets. We don't need money.
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.920]  Everything's free. But she never crit. In fact, she's mad. Trump's been criticizing
[38:58.920 --> 39:07.720]  Venezuela. She thinks it's great. Like Bernie Sanders. I mean, if you saw Cortez at a 7-Eleven
[39:07.720 --> 39:12.040]  on a Friday night, where you're, you know, your buddies are like, Hey, let's get another
[39:12.040 --> 39:15.600]  12 pack of beer. You know, watch this movie. You go to 7-Eleven, you walk in, you go, Oh
[39:15.600 --> 39:21.520]  my God, look at that meth, meth, that prostitute. I mean, I'm not being mean. It's just true.
[39:21.520 --> 39:28.080]  She looks like a meth ad prostitute. But what she is is a tyrant. So let's go ahead and
[39:28.080 --> 39:34.480]  let's play this clip of her saying I'm the boss. Here it is. It was like, you know,
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.120]  it's your worst fear. It's especially when you feel like imposter syndrome. It was your
[39:39.120 --> 39:43.560]  worst fear feeling like, like someone was going to find you out as like a fraud. And
[39:43.560 --> 39:50.560]  I read it and I was like, you know what? I don't care anymore. I don't care anymore.
[39:50.560 --> 39:59.200]  Because again, I'm at least trying and they're not. So the power is in the person who's trying
[39:59.200 --> 40:04.520]  regardless of the success. If you're trying, you've got all the power. You're driving the
[40:04.520 --> 40:08.320]  agenda. You're doing all this stuff. Like I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks
[40:08.320 --> 40:15.720]  ago and it's creating all of this conversation. Why? Because no one else has even tried because
[40:15.720 --> 40:20.840]  no one else has even tried. So people are like, Oh, it's unrealistic. Oh, it's big. Oh,
[40:20.840 --> 40:28.480]  it doesn't address this little minute thing. And I'm like, you try. You do it. Because
[40:28.480 --> 40:36.320]  you're not because you're not. So until you do it, I'm the boss. You heard it here.
[40:36.320 --> 40:42.560]  We the bosses, we the bosses. So think about this. Spain tried some of these initiatives
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.960]  that bankrupt their whole country. She wants to ban air travel. She wants, she says, if
[40:48.960 --> 40:54.360]  you can't work or don't want to work, and it just gets crazier and weirder from there.
[40:54.360 --> 41:00.880]  No, lady. We know what works. We know what doesn't work. And we know where your steering
[41:00.880 --> 41:08.240]  is is total and complete absolute disaster. And that's why you're so dangerous. And then
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.880]  you lied and said that what was on your website was on your website and said we made it up
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.600]  and later you had to admit, no, that's what you put up there. So you're just a liar to
[41:16.600 --> 41:21.080]  boot who thinks you control reality. And you know what? People aren't in power to just
[41:21.080 --> 41:27.040]  try. If you try to jump off a cliff, you might kill yourself. If you try to be a method like
[41:27.040 --> 41:33.040]  her, you're going to have a terrible life or what looks like a method. You have to be
[41:33.040 --> 41:37.600]  a real pioneer going in the right direction to empower yourself. You're like, well, I'm
[41:37.600 --> 41:44.880]  going to try to just eat 100 Twinkies a day. You're going to weigh 500 pounds in a couple
[41:44.880 --> 41:50.560]  years. So just because you try, I'm trying to eat all these Twinkies doesn't mean you're
[41:50.560 --> 41:57.200]  doing something good. Oh, we tried with communism. We tried. We tried. You're an idiot. The
[41:57.200 --> 42:03.760]  big mega banks, the establishment, they want all of the power control. They want domesticated
[42:03.760 --> 42:09.240]  morons and you're the prototype of the type of person they're going to put in charge so
[42:09.240 --> 42:13.520]  the Lemmings can sit there and believe they're going to get a bunch of free stuff from you.
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.600]  But none of it's free. It all comes with major strings attached. She's joined Cory Booker.
[42:19.600 --> 42:23.520]  I have this clip, but I don't have time because I got a bunch of the news I want to hit. She's
[42:23.520 --> 42:29.960]  now said eat fewer hamburgers. Well, that's nicer than Cory Booker. He just said, Hey,
[42:29.960 --> 42:34.200]  we're coming for your meat. You're not going to have it soon. We're going to ban it. All
[42:34.200 --> 42:39.240]  you meat eaters needs to stop. I'm going to run your lives. Like, wow, kind of all these
[42:39.240 --> 42:43.720]  lettuce hole look crazy eyed. They're always just pissed off and everything like, we're
[42:43.720 --> 42:47.280]  going to kill babies after they're born and we're going to stop them coming in kids and
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.200]  all these rapists and we're going to, we're going to, we're going to stage all the smaller
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.520]  events. They're a bunch of crazy people because they're losers. That's who they are. They're
[42:56.520 --> 43:05.080]  a bunch of losers. I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[43:05.080 --> 43:11.600]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried,
[43:11.600 --> 43:18.520]  the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all
[43:18.520 --> 43:24.000]  the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.440]  Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what
[43:29.440 --> 43:35.140]  political action did. And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in
[43:35.140 --> 43:40.840]  force now. This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech about taking
[43:40.840 --> 43:46.480]  your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war. So again, I want to thank you for
[43:46.480 --> 43:49.960]  what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.400]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 wind,

[45:04.320 --> 45:10.040]  pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress
[45:10.040 --> 45:16.400]  symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory
[45:16.400 --> 45:22.840]  function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[45:22.840 --> 45:28.320]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect
[45:28.320 --> 45:33.960]  in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting
[45:33.960 --> 45:39.360]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural
[45:39.360 --> 45:44.040]  and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it
[45:44.040 --> 45:48.920]  actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies
[45:48.920 --> 45:54.960]  immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:54.960 --> 46:19.920]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable
[46:19.920 --> 46:26.120]  dough when you get a current launch discount. This took over a year to get the top manufacturer
[46:26.120 --> 46:31.000]  developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.320]  and to make this. It's available exclusively infowarslife.com. It's simple. You get the
[46:35.320 --> 46:40.960]  highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalist

[47:40.440 --> 47:45.960]  And tell what you have to tell me. You'll see it.
[47:45.960 --> 47:53.040]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. weekdays. I'm here. Sunday's back live. 4 to 6 p.m. and
[47:53.040 --> 47:58.880]  we're right in the middle of it. By the way, Robert Barnes, who I've known about many years.
[47:58.880 --> 48:06.400]  And then I saw in the news covering what was happening with the Covington kids, representing
[48:06.400 --> 48:13.040]  some of them. He is now the lead counsel at InfoWars and we're about to launch a bunch
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.040]  of offensives against the globalists. Just give them a heads up on that. So it's very
[48:18.040 --> 48:23.640]  important, let's just understand, when you get your high quality toothpaste at InfoWars.com,
[48:23.640 --> 48:29.080]  when you get your high quality protein bars at InfoWars.com, when you get your high quality
[48:29.080 --> 48:34.800]  Wake Up America coffee at InfoWars.com, it's the best fluoride-free, coitle-silver, iodine,
[48:34.800 --> 48:39.640]  4 to 5 toothpaste. It's what I think is some of the best high quality coffee out there.
[48:39.640 --> 48:46.760]  People love it. It's amazing, high quality bars of the highest quality ingredients that
[48:46.760 --> 48:51.160]  are four, five, six, seven dollars for comparable bars and whole foods. These are top of the
[48:51.160 --> 48:57.200]  line for a three dollars regular price, 240 in a single pack, even lower when you get
[48:57.200 --> 49:03.480]  two boxes together. This has just been on a week or so, already 13 reviews, 100 percent
[49:03.480 --> 49:11.920]  satisfaction, 4.9 stars at InfoWars.com. I want to thank the listeners for all their
[49:11.920 --> 49:16.200]  support and what you do. But people in the office are like a few months ago before the
[49:16.200 --> 49:21.040]  main shipment came in, obviously made in America. They're like, this is the best bar
[49:21.040 --> 49:27.360]  I ever had. I said, yeah, we went out and one of the top developers, top producers and
[49:27.360 --> 49:35.320]  said, yeah, what's top of the line and how much does it really cost? And they're like
[49:35.320 --> 49:42.320]  $1.50 bar. We shopped around and go, that's accurate. And I said, well, what's the average
[49:42.320 --> 49:49.000]  group selling for about $6? We're gonna sell them for three. There you go. That's my philosophy.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.440]  The 150 percent markup. And then we always discount people like that. They just want
[49:54.440 --> 49:57.320]  to see there's a discount, even though the product's already discounted. And then we
[49:57.320 --> 50:04.360]  make 100 percent on it. And all you got to do sign up at InfoWars.com and just get your
[50:04.360 --> 50:10.200]  protein bars from us. Get your coffee. Look, look, they always do this with the vice and
[50:10.200 --> 50:16.440]  HBO and Showtime hit pieces and others where they go, we tested Jones products for seven
[50:16.440 --> 50:20.360]  days and see what it did to us. And they'll always pick something they say is okay to
[50:20.360 --> 50:24.000]  get your confidence. But so you think they're reasonable before they tell you all the lies.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.520]  But the latest one, the guy's like, my God, this is some of the best coffee I ever had.
[50:28.520 --> 50:36.400]  And wow, the storeable foods, this is really good. But then he goes into, yeah, why would
[50:36.400 --> 50:43.520]  you drink your water through a live straw? That's an emergency top selling at any REI
[50:43.520 --> 50:50.160]  place or anywhere. That's that in the field straw for camping. Oh, he's a con man. Why,
[50:50.160 --> 50:57.160]  he sells something that sold at Academy and sold at REI and sold at any camping or survival
[50:57.160 --> 51:01.160]  store. Well, I'd go down to the Army Navy store and buy that right now. They're good
[51:01.160 --> 51:06.880]  people, though, but I can buy it at info or store.com for about 25% less. That Jones is
[51:06.880 --> 51:14.400]  a real piece of crap. Oh, it is protein powder. I mixed it with water. It doesn't taste very
[51:14.400 --> 51:20.080]  good because you're supposed to mix it with other protein or strawberries or whatever.
[51:20.080 --> 51:26.400]  Because it's pure chaga mushroom, be pollen and the highest quality concentrated chicken
[51:26.400 --> 51:34.920]  broth dumbass. And it's awesome. Leading competitors aren't as strong and are 50, 60 bucks. We
[51:34.920 --> 51:42.120]  don't only sell it for $39.95 discounted at $29.95. It's $19.95 right now. Look, I'm digressing
[51:42.120 --> 51:48.240]  info or store.com. You get great products and you fund us. And I've got dead to rights
[51:48.240 --> 51:53.640]  documents on who's behind the lawsuits. I've got dead to rights documents on secret rating
[51:53.640 --> 52:00.760]  agencies. When this all breaks, international notice, okay? I mean, it's so criminal, so
[52:00.760 --> 52:08.040]  brazen, so naked, it's all coming out soon. But we're in a war and it takes money to prosecute
[52:08.040 --> 52:14.720]  a war. So info wars, offensive operations are about to commence. We need to start the war.
[52:14.720 --> 52:23.320]  We'll finish the war. We're going to devastate secret organizations. We're going to devastate
[52:23.320 --> 52:27.280]  their criminal activities. And by the way, you can't stop me. It's all coming out. Even
[52:27.280 --> 52:31.680]  if something happens to me, you people think that everyone's dumb like the people you pray
[52:31.680 --> 52:37.000]  on. And most of them aren't even done. They're just just foolish and not conscious. We're
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.880]  we know how to study things. We're going to come after you. So get ready. You filthy,
[52:43.880 --> 52:48.480]  dirty criminals. And by the way, both parties are involved at the top. The political power
[52:48.480 --> 52:52.640]  structure is so scared right now. You'll never put yellow vests back in the bottle. You'll
[52:52.640 --> 52:59.400]  never put the 1776 back. It's you're done. And if you want to try to tear me apart as
[52:59.400 --> 53:02.760]  some type of thing to threaten the public, you don't know the public you're dealing
[53:02.760 --> 53:07.440]  with. Yes, cowards like you, that works. Karen, you think killing everybody at the Alamo
[53:07.440 --> 53:12.400]  made the Texans all piss on themselves and give up? It sent them into a psychotic rage
[53:12.400 --> 53:19.640]  of victory. You don't seem to get it. To see people like me and the Patriot listeners
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.600]  this broadcast and our veterans, we found and build the country. We do the work. We do
[53:24.600 --> 53:28.560]  the bleeding. And then you white shoe boys come in and you move in later and take it
[53:28.560 --> 53:32.120]  all over and tell us how great and cool you are. And then think we're a bunch of cowards
[53:32.120 --> 53:43.640]  like you. That's not how it works. And you're going to find out. So have your fun. Oh, I'm
[53:43.640 --> 53:50.080]  sorry. So I haven't gotten to the show that I got Robert Barnes coming in studio. Smart
[53:50.080 --> 53:53.960]  guy will cover the whole waterfront here on a bunch of big issues. Big interview with
[53:53.960 --> 53:58.320]  him up on info wars.com that folks are loving. We did last night's like an hour long, very
[53:58.320 --> 54:03.640]  powerful, a whole bunch of big issues, but we're going to, we're going to get into. We'll
[54:03.640 --> 54:07.560]  just put it to you this way. A lot of things you're going to want to hear about in the
[54:07.560 --> 54:13.520]  next hour. Now I haven't gotten to Bill Murray yet. And some people don't get it. They say
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.240]  well, you say Bill Murray declared war on the Midwest. What he did was point out there
[54:18.240 --> 54:23.160]  is a war on the Midwest and the South by the left because the Christian ethos and because
[54:23.160 --> 54:27.360]  we don't want to be in Hollywood and all the rest of it. So he says, you know, Amazon,
[54:27.360 --> 54:35.200]  you should build in the Midwest so we can teach kids how to be gay. He actually says
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.840]  that. So he gets into his own, his old religion where everybody and how we want to be him
[54:40.840 --> 54:44.880]  and how beautiful the left is. We're going to make a little mini documentary this week.
[54:44.880 --> 54:49.560]  We're going to do it where he talks for six minutes and we put the needles and the feces
[54:49.560 --> 54:55.520]  and the statistics and the giant exodus out of California and out of Oregon and out of
[54:55.520 --> 55:00.040]  Washington state and out of the East coast and out of all these places they run. And
[55:00.040 --> 55:05.640]  we're just going to show him talking with all the statistics and numbers while he talks.
[55:05.640 --> 55:14.040]  But he says, oh, you poor pathetic, stupid redneck scum in the Midwest and in the South.
[55:14.040 --> 55:19.360]  We're going to teach you. You want to be asked, well, don't worry, Amazon, come to them with
[55:19.360 --> 55:23.640]  your slave wages and your third world workers. That's what they want. So they want to be
[55:23.640 --> 55:31.240]  in New York or Seattle and we'll, we'll finally let you into the club and teach your kids
[55:31.240 --> 55:39.560]  how to give blowjobs. I mean, he literally says all this show. It's like he's so disconnected
[55:39.560 --> 55:44.680]  like, oh, they really want Hillary. Yes. Yes. That's, they really want Bill Clinton.
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.680]  Yes. Let's, let's, let's give them that immediately. It's what they really want. Let's, let's give
[55:49.680 --> 55:57.760]  them AOC. Yep. Gay and trans sex had to be taught to five year olds in the UK, opting
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.720]  out as illegal. And it's already begun here in the US. Oh, it's illegal. The state's going
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.960]  to tell your son or daughter, they're a different sex and screw them up for life. And then they
[56:06.960 --> 56:11.480]  decide cause they're, have no Asian consent now, basically, that they want to be put on
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.240]  a hormones or whatever at age seven. We're going to do it. We're going to come screw
[56:15.240 --> 56:22.720]  your kid up and talk about chopping their wavos off. How's that sound? So are we on
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.720]  the road to civilizational collapse? We'll talk about this next hour. I'm a little bit
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.400]  behind today. We're not, we're not, we're not just seeing civilizational collapse. We're
[56:30.400 --> 56:37.640]  seeing globalist, Malthusian, directed, hyper exterminist eugenics and a neo feudalistic
[56:37.640 --> 56:44.200]  fascism being implemented to create a breakaway civilization. As this civilization collapses,
[56:44.200 --> 56:50.640]  we will be used as fuel, both literal and figurative for the breakaway civilization
[56:50.640 --> 56:54.400]  of the psychotic globalist. And that's even the London Guardian today. I know I told you
[56:54.400 --> 56:58.160]  about 20 years ago, I was reading the more esoteric writings of the establishment, but
[56:58.160 --> 57:05.240]  now in Silicon Valley's quest for immortality, a fate worse than death. Is Silicon Valley's
[57:05.240 --> 57:10.840]  quest for immortality a fate worse than death? It is spiritual death. And it's the final
[57:10.840 --> 57:16.960]  con that, oh, you don't die. You'll be uploaded into this AI system that's been tracking you
[57:16.960 --> 57:22.600]  from birth knows your voice print, your mannerisms, how you talk, what you say, but it won't be
[57:22.600 --> 57:28.320]  you. But it'll fool everyone that you've been uploaded into it. That's the system delivering
[57:28.320 --> 57:34.200]  immortality. And we will then worship the AI hive as God. I didn't just say this. I
[57:34.200 --> 57:40.520]  said it 23 years ago. I put it in a film called in game 11 years ago. It's free online. We
[57:40.520 --> 57:46.880]  can still find it in game blueprint for global enslavement. Our number two only minutes away.

[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:25.520]  for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones. We're powering up the main
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.840]  engines to maneuver the ship around to full speed and land the enemy head on. That's political.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:38.560]  We're going to defeat them. All right, we're going to play a special report and bring Robert
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.040]  Barnes in here with a whole bunch of breaking news on the other side of this break, but
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.280]  I wanted to go to this special report because, you know, all the smart tech is designed to
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:52.240]  spy on you and report back to the mothership. All the AI, all Google, all of this is about
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.480]  that. And so now Google's like, well, of course we spy on you dummy. Of course there's a
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:02.200]  microphone. Ha, ha, ha. What? I mean, you think Alex Jones is wrong? Ha, ha. Here we go.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:09.440]  Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, one of many anti-American Silicon Valley cohorts subverting our republic
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.360]  recently spun this deception during a hearing on Capitol Hill. Google has long faced criticism
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.040]  for manipulating search results to censor conservatives. Conservative individuals and
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:26.120]  organizations have had their pro-Trump content tagged as hate speech or had their content
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.840]  reduced in search results. And enforcement of immigration laws has been tagged as hate
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.920]  speech as well. Such actions pose a grave threat to our democratic form of government.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:44.960]  Dr. Robert Epstein, a Harvard-trained psychologist, authored a study recently that showed Google's
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:53.720]  bias likely swung 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Google could
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.200]  well elect the next president with dire implications for our democracy.
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.440]  When we look at it, we evaluate our studies to evaluate our search results. Today we use
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:10.280]  a very robust methodology, and we've been doing this for 20 years, making sure the results
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.640]  are accurate is what we need to do well, and we work hard to do that.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.960]  What does methodology have to do with the fact that 96% of the references to Trump are
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:18.960]  from liberal media?
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:25.160]  An independent study by search engine DuckDuckGo revealed that Google has the wherewithal to
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.200]  socially engineer political bias bubbles via its search engine as the Business Insider
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.400]  reported the study, among other things, found that participants saw vast differences in
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.120]  search results when searching for the same keywords like gun control or immigration from
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.320]  different locations across the country. A representative for DuckDuckGo said that what
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.680]  our study does reveal, or at least suggests, is that Google's collection and use of personal
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:58.280]  data, including location, which is then used to filter specific search results, is having
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.680]  an effect akin to the effects of a political bias. That stranglehold on information could
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.360]  have far-reaching effects as the 2020 presidential election draws near, and as a reminder, it's
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:16.320]  no secret that back in the 1990s, a CIA NSA program partly funded Sergey Brin to develop
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.520]  Google via a grant through Stanford University. A couple of decades later, the Department
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.880]  of Defense's deep state monstrosity Google is overseeing a U.S. population addicted to
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.560]  its search engine and its surveillance technology, invading every inch of our private space.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:38.360]  A way of creating a digital fence around the sheep to ensure their individuality doesn't
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:54.960]  allow them to stray from the flock. Inadvertently responding to this revelation
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.120]  by Whitehead hackers concerning the microphones and their Nest cameras, Google responded as
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.520]  Business Insider reported, in early February, Google announced that its home security and
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.560]  alarm system Nest Secure would be getting an update. Users would now be able to use
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.440]  Google Assistant on their devices. The problem? Users didn't know a microphone even existed
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.460]  on their Nest Secure devices to begin with. The existence of the microphone was never
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:28.640]  disclosed in any of the product material. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.800]  it had made an error and that the on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.080]  and should have been listed in the tech specs. What a complete crock of sh**. We face it.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.200]  We are currently ruled over by a lawless Silicon Valley apparatus supported by a Department
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:51.160]  of Defense circumventing our God-given rights on our own tax-paying dime. Socialist candidates
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:56.440]  linger on the horizon of the political president.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:32.680]  We can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.520]  know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either. As long as you bind yourself to something
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.480]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.160]  that transcends space and time. When you commit, be a word of mouth, or to pray for us, or
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:52.480]  to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing. So please now
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.200]  commit to support InfoWars, however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:18.520]  your own provision. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:28.240]  the bottom of your heart.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.320]  All right, Robert Barnes, who is really interesting on air. The audience loves him. I've been
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:38.280]  familiar with his work way back when he represented Wesley Snipes. Back with, you're gonna be
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.120]  almost tomorrow when we have a former Treasury agent that you successfully defended and
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.680]  went a couple of trials. They tried to put him in prison for simply teaching people that
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.240]  the IRS violates a lot of your rights. The income tax has more holes in it than the Swiss
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.080]  Cheese Show banister. But you've also represented some of the Covington kids. You've been involved
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.720]  in so many big, famous cases, Ralph Nader and Ballot Access Show. But you're not the
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.280]  type of guy they like to put on the news, because successful lawyers, they don't generally
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.480]  put on, unless it's an Alan Dershowitz. He's kind of an exception. The ones they put on
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.760]  are the ones that keep losing to the system because they want folks to get those lawyers.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.200]  But you've been very, very successful. Exactly. I mean, the way the system is designed to
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.560]  be, they're not going to promote people who are very good at hurting the system. They're
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.280]  going to promote people who help the system. So they're going to promote libel lawyers,
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:33.320]  for example, that are really bad at it. A nice music, though. Yeah, it does have nice
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.920]  music. It's about the best thing about it. But they're going to promote people that deliberately
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.880]  help the system, that help the system get away with responsibility, that help the system
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.200]  escape liability, that are going to help the system promote itself. So they love libel
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.240]  lawyers who lose all the time, just like the government loves criminal defense lawyers
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.360]  who lose all the time. So you look at, I mean, one of the issues with Roger's case is the
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.840]  first thing that happens is the criminal defense lawyers are going in and out.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.960]  Well, let's talk about that, because I'm going to spend all day on courts. But this judge,
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.640]  what she's doing, the whole situation with Manafort, Roger being gagged, now the latest
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.240]  on the Covington kids, because you don't want to say any mean things about some of the kids
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.800]  being represented by it. But the truth is they've never won one of these libel cases.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.400]  And even Dershowitz said, my God, I never say this, but you need to fire your lawyer.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.440]  You were privately telling me that two weeks ago when you were here in town, and then you
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.880]  don't want to say it on air. But now Alan Dershowitz has said it.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.000]  Yeah, he has. And what Professor Dershowitz's point was, and you rarely see him comment
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.600]  about anybody else's relationship with a lawyer. And what he said on the air, on Fox News,
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.720]  on a conservative site, was that the way in which the certain suits are being brought are
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.360]  going to jeopardize the ability to win those suits, are going to allow the media to get
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.120]  away with it. And like the reason why we're being very careful, so I'm bombarded with
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.160]  questions about people are asking, what are you going to do on Covington? How are you
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.720]  going to do it on Covington? The reason why we're very careful, we roadmap everything
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.120]  out is we want to make sure we win, because it does no good to sue the media and sue the
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.320]  institutional press and sue the establishment base in the establishment press and let the
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.240]  establishment press win, because then people are going to think that that's in fact what
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.960]  was true, what was said about the Covington kids. So it's critical that any suit that's
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:14.720]  brought has a high chance of winning, has a high chance of prevailing, not only to establish
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.720]  the truth to protect these kids, but also at the same time, to establish rights that
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.880]  will protect everybody else moving forward. So why is he suing in the wrong court? Why
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.960]  is he putting a big number up front? Why is he letting him know it's a huge fight? I mean,
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.440]  PR does nothing if it's empty. Correct, exactly. There's an old football statement, an old
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.960]  football agent used to say, you can hire one of two kind of coaches. The coach is going
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.000]  to win you the press conference, or the coach is going to actually win you games. And often
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.160]  the coach who wins you press conference doesn't win you games. And that's precisely what this
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.560]  was. So what Professor Dershowitz was criticizing is this was a lawsuit that the way it's being
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.160]  brought, how it's being framed, how it's being phrased, where it's being brought is an invitation
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.440]  to failure because it redefines the issues in favor of the institutional press, helps
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.520]  the institutional press escape responsibility, and in the process damage the potential for
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.280]  real remedy for the Covington kids. That's right. Now let's I don't want to get into my situation
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:10.960]  other than the fact that I'm not just with you, but other top law firms, Republican Party,
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:16.360]  Democratic Party, we have confirmed. And of course, we saw last Tuesday, Clarence Thomas
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.480]  came out and said, time to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan, basically get rid
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:27.440]  of the most stringent protections for journalists. And they're using info wars like I'm a big
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.040]  bloody piece of meat, they want to poison pit bulls. And so there's a big bloody piece
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.560]  of meat, they're sticking a cyanide pill in it, so that people will then tear down the
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.800]  anti slap laws that have been passed that I think overall are good to protect journalism
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:46.520]  from privileged stuff, and then create bad law period overall. And that's now admitted
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.760]  and they've got the major press cheerleading their own literal destruction. So you laid
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.520]  this out great last night. So just briefly go through the demonization, the preparation,
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.080]  the straw man, and then how it collapses into the next level. And then what the end game
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:05.800]  is, because now major legal guilds, journalistic groups, I'm not allowed to get into it, you
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.760]  know, the names, they're now contacting us and others and say, okay, you're right. We
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.120]  have a chance to set up. This is actually in the First Amendment. It's actually in
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.280]  Sullivan, New York Times versus Sullivan. But they're like, but we hate you so much.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:23.160]  Well, that's the straw man that got built. So to watch the left being manipulated by
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:29.280]  very cold, dark corporate powers is sick. Absolutely. The way I analogize it is years
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.240]  ago I explained to people that were using trust in the tax arena. They're like, how
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.600]  is it all all of a sudden started getting targeted by the IRS? They're like, how is
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.480]  this happening? Wealthy, powerful people have been using trust forever without a problem.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.720]  It's because ordinary people started using it. So the anti slap laws, which were originally
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.140]  were designed to protect little people, became sort of a monopoly of big media. But then
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:55.640]  it became started increasingly to be a powerful tool for ordinary people to be in a position
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.120]  where they could defend themselves and vindicate their rights. And as soon as that started
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.720]  happening, you started having institutional pressure to use your case and other cases
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:08.000]  to try to get rid of the anti slap protections for the little guy, because they thought they
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.120]  should have only been protections for the big guy. So as soon as they were being applied
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.400]  to the ordinary person, the everyday person, the independent press, the anti establishment
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.200]  press, the outside the establishment press, then all of a sudden it was, well, maybe we
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:23.440]  need to change these laws. Maybe we need to take them away. Maybe now they're too dangerous.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.960]  And last night you, you were late at all out. You were here two weeks ago, later down this
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.680]  week, but admitted in the press, I mean, it's everywhere. They're kind of going, Oh, wait,
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.800]  this is a larger plan with both the Republican and Democratic party behind the scenes, actually
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.520]  supporting it because they're threatened by independent information. And you've got dying
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.240]  newspapers that think, Oh, we'll join in on censorship to make ourselves relevant. No,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.200]  that's just their last act. They'll fully discredit them before big tech totally shuts
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:51.440]  them down. But, but lay out how they started with, with me, the straw man, and then leverage
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.440]  it up.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.760]  Precisely. So the first thing to do was to use Hollywood with Showtime and the Homeland
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.560]  Show to create a caricature of you that was a completely inaccurate and totally ridiculous
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.040]  version of you. But to make that the definition that people had of you, to think that character
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.280]  was Alex Jones. So that's step one. Then the lawyers who watch that show, borrow from
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:14.760]  that show's definition of you to create a lawsuit based on the lie that that show looks
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.360]  like a Homeland script completely and they're going to tell everybody that's us. Correct.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.640]  Exactly. A total fiction, a total fabrication. You dig into the lawsuit. The lawsuit doesn't
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.640]  make the allegations that a lot of people thinks that it makes. They think there's allegations
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.520]  that you were personally harassing people. Totally false. It's not even in the lawsuit.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.800]  What the lawsuit alleges is that most of the people that were never even named. Exactly.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.720]  Not even named. People were afforded an opportunity to give their side of the story. That was
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.760]  it. So what we have is the institutional press combining with big tech to, in this case,
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.160]  combine with the entertainment industry to spread a lie, then to use lawfare to make
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.160]  that lie go wider. Then they use the existence of the lawsuit as a grounds to deplatform
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.880]  you. Then they use the deplatforming you as a grounds to demand a bunch of invasive discovery.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.140]  And it's all one step to the next to try to blacklist and black and to completely blackmail
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.920]  and bankrupt anybody from ever attempting to do what you did to scare them, to intimidate
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.760]  them, to extort them into saying, I can't be a dissident voice. And that's all about
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.400]  shutting up the audience's right to choose. The audience is right to choose what news
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.400]  they read, what views they decide. It's the audience that determines whether something
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.920]  is true or not. And they admit that. And now they're just going to move in with these
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:32.640]  rating agencies run by these horrible neocon groups and leftist groups who are now starting
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.440]  actually this month on the Microsoft platform. It's going to be everywhere next year with
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.640]  this news guard. They're on your phone in live time, what you're watching and doing and
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.600]  giving you messages. Exactly. What used to be technology meant for surveillance for the
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:53.040]  state is becoming technology used by big tech itself to be outside of the restrictions
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.680]  and limitations of the state, because they're not governed by the constitution in the same
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.320]  way. And let's be clear, people think, Oh, Alex told us that, you know, nest things
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.560]  were watching, listening to us. If you're going to game out or all this, it was in
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.400]  the documents. It was in the, it was in the admissions. It was in the terms of service.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.140]  Well now they're announcing, Oh, on your phone or your computer, third party Southern
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.440]  Poverty Law Center people are literally going to be watching in live time. What you do flashing
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:22.200]  messages up, not on the website, on your phone, forget presidential alerts on your phone.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.760]  You're going to have literally people minding you like the Stasi, but the Stasi didn't tell
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.360]  you were being watched. They tell you you're being watched. Exactly. Because the best way
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.280]  to get people to censor themselves is to be scared of being watched and surveilled.
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:40.520]  And think about how that's beyond 1984 by light years. They just make the jump to like,
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.320]  well, we'll jump so far down the road, no one can even deal with this. Correct. And
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:48.280]  they're using the Chinese model to do it. So everything comes from the Chinese model.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.760]  They created their technology to comply with Chinese government obligations and they're
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.660]  using that as a, as their script in the ULA. That's right. We'll be right back with Robert
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:55.660]  Barnes.
[01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:56.660]  Stay with us.

[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:48.320]  out of the year. We're fighting hard for America and freedom. Robert Barnes, great constitutional
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:52.080]  lawyer, first amendment lawyer is here in studio with us and I said, what do you want
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.600]  to get into? He said, I want to get into Robert Mueller and pedophile range, which the Washington
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.560]  Post says don't exist, even though it's all over the place. USA Today, wow, didn't know
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:08.080]  about that. We'll be first here about Jeffrey Epstein here, you know, 10 years ago. Judge
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:15.560]  Rules Labor Secretary Acosta as federal prosecutor broke law and Jeffrey Epstein underage sex
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:20.280]  case. It wasn't underage, it was a giant sex trafficking and blackmail operation to a slave
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.200]  island. My Lord. So there it all is. If you wanted to get into this, that was actually
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:31.440]  under my stack. Paul Manafort is a hardened and bold criminal Mueller prosecutors tell,
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.160]  including Jeannie Ray, Hillary's top cover up artist for Russia Gate and China Gate at
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.280]  her foundation. So, I mean, I couldn't hold a straight face in that judge's courtroom
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:46.320]  when Jeannie Ray is my prosecutor, he'd be like, I was a Jew in World War II, hypothetically,
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.920]  and the head judge is Hitler. I'd be like, dude, you're Adolf Hitler. I mean, this is
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:56.000]  insane. So this is all starting to come out. And it's crazy. And the media tries to spin
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.480]  it because there's some Trump connection is later this guy got into government. This
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:05.520]  is bipartisan. Clearly, they tried to set up a high powered lawyers and other people
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.440]  that weren't involved. That's all Mueller stock and trade. So condensing this down,
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:12.280]  Robert Barnes, you've really studied it. What's happening?
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.240]  So there's one name that all those stories are connected to the Epstein case, the Manafort
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:22.480]  case and the Roger Stone case. And interestingly enough, it's the one name that the judge in
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.020]  the Roger Stone case said that Roger Stone can never reference. Not only can he not reference
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:32.400]  it related to his case, he can never talk about one name period while his case is pending
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.480]  in court, which could be years. And what name is that? Robert Mueller. And what is Robert
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:41.880]  Mueller to do with the Epstein case? Guess who was FBI director when that deal was done?
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:46.280]  Guess who was identified in internal FBI documents? They're identified by a guy on Twitter called
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:52.760]  Technofog, a famous lawyer that identify what the informant and informant for Robert Mueller
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.720]  was Mr. Epstein. In other words, he was giving blackmail files potentially on a wide range
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:02.840]  of people to Robert Mueller. At the same time, the sweetheart deal that broke the rules was
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.960]  being filed on behalf of Epstein. And so while Epstein gets to sit in a sweetheart deal, Paul
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.600]  Manafort's supposed to go to prison for life. Paul Manafort's supposed to be the most harshly
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.360]  punished individual in one of the most history of political prosecutions. So Paul Manafort
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.440]  who's never been accused of anything connected to pedophilia is going to go to prison for
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:28.040]  life and rot until he dies. But Epstein, who is running a blackmail ring of underage prostitution,
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.440]  gets to walk. And the only man that they all have in common is Robert Mueller. And it's
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.000]  the one person that the judge said Roger Stone can never talk about even unrelated to his
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.120]  case. So that's the common denominator between all three is that the deep state fix it, man,
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.160]  is still fixing things for the deep state. And again, this is bigger than rushing all
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:55.240]  these things. It's a window into how Hoover operated a window into how your other big
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:02.240]  Titans of control have operated, whether we were talking about it last night and what
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:07.560]  happened with some of the Hollywood groups. This is done over and over and over again.
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:13.000]  And when you look at the judges ruling on Stone, he obviously got maneuvered by his lawyers
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.840]  to say this is the worst thing ever. We grovel your Supreme Majesty when you read what they
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.240]  said. Oh, we're so terrible. We're so bad. There was a shot of you on his website with
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:27.680]  a little Celtic cross up of the corner, fact toy with letters and words after it. And then
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.400]  they get Stone's lawyer says, Oh, this is unconscionable. It's indefensible. The judge
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.280]  says you're damn right. You can't talk about anybody who's in the case, even in things
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:45.520]  separate from the case. Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein, Robert Mueller, anybody. And then
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:52.240]  Roger disappears into a literal black hole, whereas where they want him to get him to
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.320]  get, I guess, bear false witness against the president. This is just unprecedented. Absolutely.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:02.240]  This is a prior restraint on free speech, which has been almost uniformly and universally
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:06.720]  decried by the court systems all the way. They're not what he what she did is violate his first
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:11.360]  amendment rights, but also violate his fifth amendment right to due process, his sixth amendment
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:15.360]  right to a fair trial, and his eighth amendment right against excessive bail. Because what
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.040]  she said is that his conditions of release would now require this gag order that if he
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.480]  violated, she would put him in prison. So you how did his Rogers lawyers, so I'm not trying
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.440]  to be enemies with, but how do they maneuver your majesty? This is indefensible. She goes,
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:37.120]  you are correct. Silence forever. I mean, how on earth when you got Cheney Ray slithering
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:43.120]  around Hillary so arrogant, her main cover up lawyer at her foundations running the prosecution.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.640]  That's of course they don't want Roger to be able to talk about that. Completely. People
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.680]  are crazy. Let me give him a little newsflash. It's already done. Everybody already knows
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.920]  everywhere. I don't know what you morons. Listen to MPR, you know, believe your own
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:01.680]  yes. No one is smoking your dope anymore. Exactly. I mean, sort of one of my universal
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.400]  rules of law is never bow to abusive authority. Period. Because whenever you do, abusive
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.920]  authority just sees that as weakness, and they whack you and hit you and hurt you further.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:15.240]  You have to challenge it. You have to question it. You have to contest it. It's the only
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:20.120]  way justice or liberty is ever defended or ever done. And it's a natural tendency for
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:24.360]  a lot of lawyers to say, Oh, please, if they think if they walk in on sackcloth and on
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.960]  their knees and beg the bad king to do the good thing, that all of a sudden the bad king
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.000]  is going to do the good thing that never happens. It's only when you expose the bad king for
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.760]  doing things that violate the most protected liberties and rights we have in the legal
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.720]  process that you can get them to actually try to do at least part of the right thing.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:48.160]  And that I think was a practical and tactical error here that backfired to where Roger is
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.600]  in a literal black hole where he has literally been told if he speaks in his own defense in
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:59.480]  a criminal case, even about, well, the entire corporate media range down lies 24 seven.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.640]  Exactly. If he merely responds to a defamatory libelous lie in the public about him, that's
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.880]  negatively influencing his reputation forever outside of the contours of the case. If he
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.160]  says one word in his own defense, he goes to prison, by the way, it's worse than that
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.200]  before everybody else was in the courtroom, clammed up. They said, Well, they were obsessed
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:20.920]  with you and could you be silenced? Exactly. And so the judges like once anyone he ever
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:26.360]  knew you can't think and by that six degrees of separation, the whole planet by his own
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.320]  words, there appears to be a coordinated conspiracy between Robert Mueller's team, people like
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.160]  Larry claiming and others who are trying to create these fake surrogates that are not
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.560]  actually surrogates of Roger Stone to take Roger Stone's gag order and suppress and
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:42.800]  censor speech across the board from a wide range of independent dissident voices who
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.360]  have one unique thing in common. There one unique thing in common is questioning the
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.880]  behavior of Robert Mueller and his team. So that's it. And you know, we can talk about
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.200]  great Trump is all day, but he's asleep at the switch. Tweets don't do it. President
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.880]  protect us.

[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:03.840]  infohorselife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:09.000]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.880]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:21.720]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:27.120]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:32.480]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:38.720]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.280]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.560]  blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.920]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infohorselife.com
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:01.120]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:19.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:48.800]  Introducing the Republic from Enemies, Born and Domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:54.160]  I want to shift gears with Attorney of Law Robert Barnes here with us and I want to get
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:01.840]  into the state of the nation, the state of the world right now because clearly, the so-called
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.240]  left, I don't call them liberals, they're the left-hand path, Jacobins, French Revolution,
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.320]  that's where their ethos in the last 200 years, 220 years, is the Jacobins. Any real historian
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:17.440]  will go, oh yeah. So if you're like a PhD level big think tank, they all see the world
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:23.240]  as the Jacobins on the left versus the Renaissance on the right. And the Jacobins pose as if
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:27.120]  they were the Renaissance in an attempt to take it over. So America and our revolution
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.960]  was Renaissance-based. They always tried to tie up the French Revolution, which Jefferson
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.000]  was tied to but later he found out it was bad. And of course you've got your own historical
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.400]  background, you're a smart guy on that front. But we have got the left terrorizing, attacking,
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.480]  used to like every month I'd have a video of them beating up somebody to make America
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:48.320]  great again. I get them every day or a couple of times a day and I will play some of these
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:54.760]  clips and then they escalate from all the coastlines. They'll be flooded by 2013, Gore
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:59.160]  said 10 years earlier. Now it's, there won't be a planet in 12 years. We're all dead. They're
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.360]  just escalating and it seems like they're already hit peak level and I think it's turned,
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.120]  I know it's turning people off. Do you agree with that B? Where does it go from here? Because
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.280]  I really think that their escalation, their attempt to make us submit is actually only
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280]  awakened to people.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.320]  I think it has. I mean, I think the, the, there are some people who are going to be
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.080]  scared and intimidated by it just naturally. And that's their original and initial goal
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:27.680]  is to be afraid, to be publicly affiliated and associated with anything that challenges
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:31.600]  the establishment press perspective, including whether it's on Trump or whether it's make
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.160]  America great again or it's cultural conservatism, turning point, whomever it is. So, you know,
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.160]  I was out here in Texas and went into a restaurant where an elderly guy is wearing his MAGA hat
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.120]  and realized when I walked by just how rare that had been of late that if I had been in
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:48.560]  any major Northeastern or West Coast city, I don't see that anywhere ever where it was
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.360]  more popular and common around the time of the campaign. So it's having some deterrent
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:56.400]  effect on people being willing to voice their opinions, but ultimately that will lead to
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.320]  a backlash on people who do not like it makes it like a diamond under pressure coal. It only
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.280]  internalizes it and it makes it even more and instinctively people understand that when
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.960]  you try to suppress their opinions that that means their opinions are more likely right
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.920]  than wrong. There's no reason nobody's afraid of a dumb opinion. Well, what we went to lunch
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.640]  today and I had coming in Hispanic families, the table Hispanic families, really good-looking
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:22.440]  nice families just loving the truth is Hispanics love freedom. Absolutely. That's why Trump
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.680]  some of his best success, some of his biggest improvements was doubling Republican numbers
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.440]  for Hispanics. Exactly. Just like you did with African American. They see through it.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.880]  They're like, well, as soon as Van Jones was going nuts on CNN that night saying, oh, it's
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.680]  a white lash. And I was like, well, why don't you take a look at Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:42.840]  and Ohio and to end Michigan? And what were you going to find? The decisive vote was African
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.840]  American precincts voting more for Trump than they did for Hillary than they did for Obama.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.200]  And consequently, that is why he won the tipping margin in Wisconsin, the tipping margin. By
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:57.200]  the way, where did info wars with Roger Stone's advice? We targeted Pennsylvania, Wisconsin
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:04.160]  and Michigan with everything we had. We ran. Well, he we targeted those promos and Danny
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.880]  Williams to the black community. Absolutely. We had some, we had a Facebook stuff that
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:12.680]  we ran that had 48 million views between the channels. Correct. And that's why Hillary
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.080]  of them made the proper analysis. Like they want info or sunk. I'm not bragging, but like
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.680]  I was like a fighter bomber, you know, they have the stuff they've shot down the side.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:24.080]  Info wars is just festooned with shootouts. Completely. I remember telling people right
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.460]  after the election that there's going to be a whole war waged on info wars and other places
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:33.160]  like it because you were the most influential in creating the the sort of mainstream press
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.200]  establishment that wanted to suppress Trump's message to overcoming that. And that was the
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.600]  first time they had seen it overcome in a presidential election. They're like, holy
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:46.040]  cow, info wars can tip the war and the political war for the most election for the most powerful
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.200]  office in the world. I raised that more and more as we didn't make a big deal at the time.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.840]  It's almost embarrassing. I don't want to be arrogant. No, no, we were effective. Our
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.640]  audience was effective. Now we are under total attack. Exactly. My favorite rule, Tennessee
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:02.560]  rule, which is an only only a stuck pig squeals. So when you see somebody being squealed about
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.120]  chances are by the press and by the establishment and by the corrupt insiders in DC, that means
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.400]  that person has been effective. That means that person is likely saying something truthful.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:15.920]  You don't need to take somebody who's not Galileo to the stake. You need to take Galileo
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.760]  to the stake because Galileo is speaking such deep truth that it's a threat to the establishment
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.160]  in the system. So that if you see someone being targeted, exceptionally targeted, that's
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.000]  really a message to pay special attention. And I don't want to over promote this, but
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.600]  it's, because it's, it's negative and it's painful and I'm not enjoying it. And the crew
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.040]  is either the reason we're here in the audience, the crew, it's all one family, all one body
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.640]  fighting. But I think they've way overdone it now where at the grassroots and everything
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.840]  and even the government is a lot of good people in other places. It's like, we've got a lot
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.440]  of the intellectuals, some people go, what is him for wars? Why is it under so much
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.200]  attack? So they may have cut some of our outreach down, but the quality was a great audience.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:59.720]  But the quality now is major governments, militaries, intelligence agencies are like
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.720]  pin drop listening now. It's like what the hell scared the system so much about this
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.840]  show. Exactly. And that's the natural reaction to people who are instinctive, to people who
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.880]  are intuitive, to people who are intelligent, to people who have skeptical perspective of
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:15.520]  the world. They're going to look at this and say, if this person's being targeted and this
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.680]  network's being targeted, it must be saying or doing something that's so deeply true and
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.960]  so radically true that they need me, the audience to not hear it. For them to be so scared that
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.080]  me, the audience can make my own decisions with my own rational faculty, with my own
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:31.640]  moral judgment. They're scared of me making that judgment. And that's why they want to
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.720]  suppress and censor the speech of Info Wars and Alex Jones, is they don't want me, the
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:40.560]  audience to make my own judgment of my own views and choose my views accordingly. And
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.360]  it's an intimidation to the system. And they recognize the system feels a threat. It hasn't
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.760]  felt in a very long time. Now, they're also very threatened by Turning Point, USA, that's
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:52.560]  reaching out to everybody, but very, very effective at, you know, unifying people around
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:57.040]  Americana ideas with Candace Owens and others that are involved. We've got too many of
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.520]  these videos, they're on infowars.com, but here's one just a few days ago. And I'm surprised
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.920]  CNN even said this is wrong because they get, they push too far, you know, like stultrers
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.280]  claiming now they never reported at CNN about the Smollett hoax. Because so they're really
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:14.400]  understanding, wow, we overdid it. But real politically motivated hate crime caught on
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:19.640]  camera. And they just, the guy just beats the hell out of a guy handing out Turning
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:23.440]  Point USA flyers at the college. So here's that video.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:30.480]  Jesus Christ. What, what?
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:49.240]  Oh, as long as he calls him racist, he can punch him over and over again in the face.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.520]  And when they say the racist word, it's like a white guy beat up a white guy. It's white
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:57.160]  guys almost always wanting to show off that whites are bad, a few white people. It's,
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.480]  it's total mental illness.
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.920]  Absolutely. They're all trying to seek social prestige points that they're more morally
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.240]  just than others. I always point out whenever somebody makes that point to me, I'm always
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.840]  like, well, tell me about the civil rights cases you've supported. Tell me about the
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.920]  civil rights movements you've been a part of. You've been a part of civil rights cases.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.200]  You've been a part of civil rights movements. These kids, they never have all these big
[01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:18.840]  grandstanding lefties who want to make big social media points about how they're for
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:19.840]  civil rights.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:20.840]  Where are they on the front?
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:24.400]  Oh, I'm not bragging about myself, but you tried going and protesting the Klan 20 years
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.680]  ago in East Texas. Some of those towns are bad. Those cops are against you too there.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:33.320]  Not all cops are, but most cops are good. But there you're like, the Klan's threatened
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.720]  to kill you and you say, Hey cops do something. They go, F you. We're a part of the invisible
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.720]  empire.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.000]  Exactly. I had a cop in Mississippi. Tell me if I ever came back to town, it'd be the
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.480]  last time anybody saw me.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.600]  So that's, I respect people who actually do something substantive and something concrete.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.880]  But it's like a lot of people who, who virtue signal for refugees or virtue signal, I've
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.240]  done pro bono work for actual refugees. Don't virtue signal for fake refugees when you're
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:57.080]  not, not even willing to take them into your own house. If you really care about them,
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.600]  fine, sponsor them, put them up at home.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.200]  Well, England won't take in the famous Pakistani woman who was on death penalty, got out. They're
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.240]  trying to kill her. And then she's a Christian. They go, Oh, you're a Christian. You're upset
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.040]  Muslims. Have we taken you in?
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.460]  Exactly. And instead they're willing to let ISIS brides come back home. So the, the insanity
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:18.320]  of this sort of combination, all because of virtue signaling people who don't do anything
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.160]  for civil rights on the frontline. And so their reflection of their harassment is really
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.040]  because they don't really believe in civil rights. They don't believe in civil civil liberties.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.360]  They don't care about constituencies that they claim to care about. They only care about
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.200]  them being morally superior to everyone else and having more power than everybody else.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.640]  And that's why they're so threatened by those like AOC said, she said, I have the power.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.640]  You don't shut up.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:41.440]  Exactly. And that's the whole mentality. That's the whole mindset. It's a young status, young
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.960]  Mao cultural revolutionary kind of mindset where they're putting their own parents in
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:49.400]  prison during the Mao era. It's the same dangerous mindset that if we let loose, it's too dangerous
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.200]  of what it could do to liberty in America.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:58.160]  Absolutely. We're going to come back leaving bigger news on the other side. Stay with us.

[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.200]  We've got the war room 3 p.m. after that. We've got David Nye doing a great job. 8 a.m.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:39.520]  central. David Nye's show. Robert Barnes is our guest. I'll take a lot of calls this
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:43.960]  week too but we are going to have some big interviews, some big guests and I've got some
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:48.920]  other big stuff in the hopper that I don't like to talk about something until the fish
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:58.680]  is in the boat. You know, gaffed it in the ice chest and then it's Miller time. So that's
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:02.320]  what's going to happen and I'm going to leave it at that and just stop right there. We've
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.120]  got a bunch of irons in the fire but a lot of calls this week. Love to take your calls.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.760]  No calls today. We covered this last night in a special report but I want to get into
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:17.320]  it again because I didn't elaborate enough on what I was going to say. Yes, you watched
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:24.880]  the Bill Maher piece from his show on HBO Friday night and it sounds like he's loving
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:33.440]  flyover country in the south or geographically 92-93% of the country. In fact, that map they
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:40.960]  show isn't even accurate. It's more red than that. But what he's saying is oh, the south
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:49.880]  and the midwest wants to be the east and wants to be California. I want to be clear. California
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:55.080]  is a gorgeous state. A lot of amazing people used to be more swashbuckling than Texas in
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:59.760]  many respects. It's been colonized by leftist people going there from all over the country
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:05.680]  to be movie stars. I mean, it's like the narcissist of the planet went there and ruined it. So
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.360]  there's a lot of good in California. There's a lot of good in Oregon. There's a lot of
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.560]  good in the outside of Portland. It's wonderful people. Something with Washington state. But
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.320]  I don't sit there and hate the people and say I'm better than them just in general.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:24.560]  But there is an attitude living here in Austin. It's been colonized by kind of the locusts
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.320]  that went to California and ate it dry to the bone. And now they've come here that we're
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:35.200]  these losers. We're these idiots. We're just ride horses to work every day. We haven't
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:43.880]  discovered toilet paper yet. And Marge's plays into that during the whole piece. Like, oh,
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:49.120]  Bezos, he should have, you know, done somewhere in the Midwest or he should have, you know,
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.040]  come there because they want to be us. Bezos mainly uses foreign or labor in people. And
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.320]  of all the tech guys, he's not even one of the worst. He at least doesn't own slave factories
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.680]  in China like Apple or he isn't helping the Chinese government censor people. I'm not
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:05.840]  defending Bezos either, but it's kind of true. Like why are you on Bezos? He's nothing compared
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:14.720]  to this, but AOC runs him and his deal out of New York City. I think blind hogs do find
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:19.680]  acres broken clocks are right twice a day. She's right that why should the whole thing
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.560]  be written off? Why should ultra rich guys that lecturers about being liberal all day
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:28.120]  not pay any tax? That's actually a point she's making. So I'm agreeing with AOC here, but
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.080]  you don't run it off. But what she should be talking about is how he's exploiting all
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:36.240]  this illegal alien and immigrant labor. But, but, but I want to go to this piece. It's
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.320]  just that it's the condescension. Everyone's fleeing California in the Northeast. The statistics
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.960]  show it. You say you owe the money. Well, yeah, the billionaires live there, but you
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.600]  cut them out of the equation. It's one of the poorest areas, highest areas of welfare,
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:54.720]  feces everywhere, needles everywhere, highest crime. I mean, the truth is blue areas suck.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:59.200]  So yeah, we may not have the highest property values of the country, but we sure as hell,
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.120]  you know, don't have our kids learning how to get blowjobs when they're five or we still
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.320]  follow glory down at the courthouse.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.840]  Well, exactly. In fact, when you look at it, you look at like, for example, for Trump country,
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.000]  you can drive from the southern tip of Florida to the northern part of Maine from the coastal
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.280]  part of Virginia to coastal California for the northern woods of Wisconsin to the Texas-Mexico
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:23.920]  border and without hitting any Hillary County. By contrast, if you want to travel for Hillary,
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:28.120]  you got to go by plane. Why is that? Why have it's rural, whether it's Maine or whether
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.840]  it's north Texas? They're good hard people. They know what's going on.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.360]  Exactly. I remember it last during the during the election, 2016, as part of a bet that
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.720]  I was going to make. I traveled through all of Eastern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania and
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:44.000]  went through all these small towns and the parts that were the most Americana, the part
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.160]  celebrating community, the part celebrating family, the part celebrating tradition, the
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:51.960]  part celebrating work, the parts celebrating everything we celebrate about what it means
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:54.120]  to be a man. They can't get further away from Hollywood.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:56.040]  Absolutely. And they think we want to be that.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:59.200]  Their definition of Hollywood is going out still in their car and have a little picnic
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:04.000]  in front of the big outdoor movie theater. I mean, it's old school Americana. It's a belief
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.080]  that when you see a film event, you do it with your family, with your friends and with
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:13.280]  your neighbors all sharing together. So it's the best definition of Americana. It's not
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:17.560]  individualism of an extreme kind. It's individualism that celebrates the individual, protects
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:21.680]  the individual rights, but in the context of family and community, of values of church.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:26.200]  So why is Hollywood so threatened? And I interrupt you about the most patriotic places, but let
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.200]  me get into that.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.400]  Absolutely. I think it's because as a core level, I think part of it is a desire to
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:35.400]  be those people. I think a lot of these people in Hollywood down deep would much rather be
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:39.320]  honest middle Americana than they would to be arrogant Hollywood.
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:42.840]  Almost all the real Hollywood people have moved to the most rural areas. They love it.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:43.840]  Exactly.
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:44.840]  Whether it's Dave Chappelle or anybody.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.240]  Paul Newman. Gene Hackman. I mean, these are people, I always said that the best Hollywood
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:51.520]  actors are people that are way, way out of Hollywood. I mean, a sniper.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.520]  Robert DeVall.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:53.520]  Absolutely.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.520]  Wesley Snipes.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.520]  Exactly.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.520]  Everybody.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:57.520]  They're trying to get away from it because they recognize the culture.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:00.440]  Crickletters, my friend. He's been, never he hates Hollywood. He's been 30 years out
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.920]  in the woods, outside Austin.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:05.520]  Precisely. Whereas the more corrupt ones, the ones that have been corrupted, take someone
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:09.120]  like Michael Moore, when he's in middle America, Michigan, he's doing one kind of film. Then
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:12.680]  he goes to New York and he's doing a totally different kind of film. When he's in Michigan,
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:13.960]  he's sold out his roots.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:17.080]  Absolutely. When he's in Flint, he's talking about workers. When he's in New York, he's
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:22.080]  talking about evil, terrible, scary guns. So it's a different mindset mentality that's
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.480]  part of a culture that corrodes moral value, that corrodes community, that it's like sort
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:30.400]  of Weimar Germany, Berlin, 1920s. Anything goes into it.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.880]  And out of that comes the Hitler.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.880]  Exactly.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.160]  It always does. Why out of the putrid leftist swamp, always some super fascist evil comes?
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:41.360]  Precisely. I think it's twofold. One, they create a sort of chaotic moral environment
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:46.320]  that terrifies a lot of people, that the fascist types are able to parlay off. But secondly,
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.320]  they get the benefit of the end. Once you corrode values to where there are no values,
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.440]  it's easy for a Hitler to step forward. It is those core values that stops the Hitler's
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:59.440]  of the world from arising. It's those core values of family, Americana, of tradition,
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.440]  of community.
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.000]  And the globalist corporates, they just want people to submit to their corporate system.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:06.320]  They don't get their getting rid of the immune system. It's going to stop stuff way more
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.320]  evil than they are.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:11.640]  Exactly. They are short-sighted. And they're looking at it just like someone who only values
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:16.160]  the next stock report. The corporations are looking at a short-sighted system, a Chinese
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:20.920]  based model that undermines moral values that is ultimately the safety net for American
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:24.960]  freedom and liberty are those moral values in middle America. The same ones Bill Maher
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:30.440]  mocked because down deep he knows it's what stops his idolatry and ideology from becoming
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.120]  the dominant ideology and idolatry.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:38.120]  Well, his claim that we want to be them, yeah, maybe young, dumb girls that didn't get enough
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.400]  daddy time. I mean, yeah, real idiots like bugs do a bug zapper go out to LA. But almost
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:47.440]  everyone I know, famous actors, you name it, you know a lot of them, they hate it. They
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.840]  can't get further away from it.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:49.840]  Absolutely.
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.280]  That's why they all want to produce stuff in New Zealand or Toronto or Louisiana. They
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.480]  do not want to be around it.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:57.840]  And those kids from middle America that show up in Hollywood and Vine, in two years they're
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:00.880]  trying to get the hell out of Hollywood. They're trying to figure out ways to get a bus trip
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.080]  back home. They're trying to get back to real values, to real tradition, to real community,
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.080]  things that really mattered.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.400]  Because everybody tells you what you want to hear, but they don't, they can, they deliver
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:11.400]  on nothing.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:16.400]  Absolutely. It's vacant. It's down deep. It's empty. Empty space. One big massive empty
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.120]  space. So what if you dug in and we could do an x-ray of Bill Maher's soul, what it
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.800]  would be is just empty display. There would be nothing there. There wouldn't be anything
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:27.280]  evil. There wouldn't be anything good. It's just one big empty vacant space. And down
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.280]  deep, he knows that.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:32.560]  So down deep, he wants to be like those middle America people who have a deep soul, who have
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:37.480]  a deep value system, who represent the best of America and the best America ever has,
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.280]  ever is, never will be.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.560]  And that's the difference between middle America and Hollywood America.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.360]  Because the soulless is envious of those that have a soul.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.640]  Absolutely. Down deep, they look at the life that I couldn't, when I was going through,
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.840]  I wanted to move to rural Western Pennsylvania. It's like, these are great ways of life. Reminded
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.360]  me of Southeast Tennessee, great communities, great cultures connected, caring about each
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:03.480]  other. The guy in the mobile home and the guy in the fancy home are just two blocks apart.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.480]  So they can't ignore one another. They can't evade one another. They have to care about
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:08.480]  and respect one another.
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:11.880]  Just like the South and Blacks and whites are all living right with each other.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:15.560]  Exactly. And that's why you get the highest interracial marriage rate is amongst poor
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.080]  and working class Southerners, historically. It's not amongst privileged class folks up
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.080]  in upstate New York.
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.680]  Now white people, let me say, the widest areas in statistics, Paul Wasis reports, are white
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.280]  people who are liberal.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.280]  Absolutely.
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.280]  They are the most racist.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.680]  Well, they did a recent survey where they asked, and I'd seen this all the time growing
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.280]  up, and saw it, particularly when I got to Yale and Law School, they did a survey and
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:39.800]  they looked at how liberals talked to African-Americans versus conservatives. And what they found is
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:40.800]  that liberals...
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:44.480]  Well, that was even the Washington Post had met that last year. They talked down to them
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.480]  like they're idiots.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:49.040]  Totally condescending because down deep, they see them as less than human. It's like reading
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:52.760]  Thomas Wolfe from the late 1960s, electric Kool-Aid test, those kind of books, where
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.320]  he talked about Lenny Bernstein trying to do a fundraiser for the Black Panthers in Upper
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.760]  West Side Manhattan and how the solution to all the Upper West Side liberals to having
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.680]  Black servants was, oh yeah, we'll have white servants instead. Not recognizing maybe the
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:07.400]  problem is their whole servant culture that they've adapted in the first place.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.920]  Well, no, it's like you said about all these famous people go, well, if we don't have Mexicans
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.080]  no one will clean our toilets. Then I know there's Mexican directors, scientists, everything
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.040]  else. Like the idea that the person cleaning my toilet is a Mexican.
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.040]  Exactly.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:21.040]  It just shows...
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:22.040]  I need my toilet cleaner.
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:24.440]  Precisely. They have a very limited cultural view. These are the people that hit the locks
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.440]  as soon as they go through any neighborhood that's African-American. Not being able to
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.880]  tell the difference between a dangerous area and a non-danger.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.880]  When I first got around leftist, I thought, is this a test when they're calling people
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.840]  inwards? I'm like, well, I don't do that.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:36.840]  Exactly.
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:41.240]  It's not because I'm this goody-tooshies person. It's that I don't lower myself. I can't handle
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:48.880]  it. We didn't play the Bill Maher yet. We'll play it when we come back. It's truly safe.
