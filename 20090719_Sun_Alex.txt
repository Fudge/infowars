[00:00.000 --> 00:09.560]  Watch me, watch me steal everything you got
[00:09.560 --> 00:10.560]  Yeah!
[00:10.560 --> 00:11.560]  Right!
[00:11.560 --> 00:12.560]  Woo!
[00:12.560 --> 00:13.560]  Yeah!
[00:13.560 --> 00:17.560]  I got something to fix you gonna shout
[00:17.560 --> 00:22.120]  Gonna take everything you got, baby, yeah
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.240]  I got some food to steal
[00:26.240 --> 00:32.760]  Ha ha ha, I feel good
[00:32.760 --> 00:38.240]  Coming to America, gonna rip you off
[00:38.240 --> 00:39.240]  I gotta move
[00:39.240 --> 00:44.760]  Where the police beat up ambulance drivers for no reason
[00:44.760 --> 00:49.360]  Where the IRS take your money and not tell you where it goes
[00:49.360 --> 00:51.360]  Sometimes I feel so nice
[00:51.360 --> 00:52.360]  Oh yeah
[00:52.360 --> 00:53.360]  Ha ha ha, gonna take you in
[00:53.360 --> 00:54.360]  Ha ha ha, gonna take you in
[00:54.360 --> 00:55.360]  Ha ha ha, gonna take you in
[00:55.360 --> 00:57.360]  I'm gonna give it to my friends
[00:57.360 --> 01:03.360]  Cause I'm a gangster in chief, baby, yeah
[01:03.360 --> 01:04.360]  I like to do my thing
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.360]  Ha ha ha ha, and I don't need no one else
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.360]  Sometimes I feel so nice
[01:13.360 --> 01:17.360]  Oh, we only have fifty million abortions
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.360]  And the stupid people don't even know it's a baby
[01:21.360 --> 01:24.360]  Ha ha ha, these suckers is ready
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.360]  That is coming to town!
[01:56.360 --> 01:58.360]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:58.360 --> 02:00.360]  The new one, no!
[02:02.360 --> 02:04.360]  Lock of use, baby, I'm gonna give it to you!
[02:04.360 --> 02:06.360]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.360]  You want daddy to hurt you real, you will get ready!
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.360]  How about I break your nose and knock your teeth out, bitch?
[02:13.360 --> 02:15.360]  Give it!
[02:15.360 --> 02:16.360]  Give it!
[02:16.360 --> 02:18.360]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:18.360 --> 02:20.360]  You like SWAT teams and cameras?
[02:20.360 --> 02:22.360]  You're my whole now!
[02:22.360 --> 02:24.360]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:24.360 --> 02:26.360]  It's the American bitch!
[02:26.360 --> 02:28.360]  I drag her by the hair!
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.360]  She begs me to, begs me to take it easy!
[02:32.360 --> 02:36.360]  And that's when I put cigarettes out on her eyes!
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.360]  And she thinks me old!
[02:39.360 --> 02:42.360]  She said keep doing it, baby, yeah!
[02:42.360 --> 02:45.360]  I got the thing, tell me what it's all about!
[02:45.360 --> 02:48.360]  I got soul!
[02:48.360 --> 02:50.360]  No soup with bad!
[02:50.360 --> 02:52.360]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.360]  That's how it is to be a nation of crack whore,
[02:56.360 --> 02:58.360]  drug addict, brain damaged prostitutes.
[02:58.360 --> 03:00.360]  That's basically what we are.
[03:00.360 --> 03:03.360]  We're just a totally drugged out cigarette burns all over us,
[03:03.360 --> 03:06.360]  mindlessly gibbering, watching Saturday morning cartoons,
[03:06.360 --> 03:11.360]  laying in a flea bag hotel with stains all over the carpet,
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.360]  and just the lowest of the low,
[03:13.360 --> 03:18.360]  Johns of the world lined up for $5 to have their way with us.
[03:18.360 --> 03:20.360]  We're just covered with slime,
[03:20.360 --> 03:22.360]  and we just watch the TV gibbering and drooling,
[03:22.360 --> 03:24.360]  we don't have any front teeth,
[03:24.360 --> 03:26.360]  and the Federal Reserve just comes in with a night stick,
[03:26.360 --> 03:29.360]  if we ever argue and just beats us in the head,
[03:29.360 --> 03:30.360]  that's who we are.
[03:30.360 --> 03:32.360]  We're a drugged out prostitute
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.360]  who weighs about 90 pounds with cigarette burns all over,
[03:36.360 --> 03:38.360]  with clumps of hair falling out.
[03:38.360 --> 03:41.360]  A crack whore right on the end, right on the edge,
[03:41.360 --> 03:44.360]  be dead soon, be taken out and thrown in a river,
[03:44.360 --> 03:46.360]  and nobody in the world will care,
[03:46.360 --> 03:48.360]  after all, we were that crack whore,
[03:48.360 --> 03:50.360]  we were that arrogant, evil country.
[03:50.360 --> 03:52.360]  Sucked dry, totally imploded.
[03:52.360 --> 03:54.360]  And I'm sorry to use analogies like that,
[03:54.360 --> 03:57.360]  but that's what we are, a toothless crack whore
[03:57.360 --> 03:59.360]  with crust all over our eyes.
[03:59.360 --> 04:02.360]  We were once a beautiful 18-year-old woman
[04:02.360 --> 04:04.360]  who ran away from home,
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.360]  ran away from the church,
[04:06.360 --> 04:08.360]  ran away from goodness.
[04:08.360 --> 04:10.360]  We were going to live on the streets,
[04:10.360 --> 04:12.360]  we were going to make it big in Hollywood,
[04:12.360 --> 04:15.360]  and now we're a crack whore with our hair falling out.
[04:15.360 --> 04:19.360]  We still love the pimp and the drugs he gives us.
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.360]  We worship the pimp, we love him, we kiss his boots.
[04:23.360 --> 04:25.360]  That's who we are.
[04:25.360 --> 04:27.360]  We worship the police, we worship the prisons,
[04:27.360 --> 04:29.360]  we worship the sodium fluoride in the water,
[04:29.360 --> 04:32.360]  we worship our kids dying of cancer being injected.
[04:32.360 --> 04:34.360]  That's who we are.
[04:34.360 --> 04:36.360]  Can we crawl out and we make it to a hospital?
[04:36.360 --> 04:39.360]  Could we ever get our soul back?
[04:39.360 --> 04:42.360]  Probably not, the brain's too fried.
[04:42.360 --> 04:46.360]  But see, we're not just one person, we're not just one crack whore.
[04:46.360 --> 04:49.360]  This crack whore symbolizes the body politic
[04:49.360 --> 04:52.360]  which those of us that aren't crack whores and slaves
[04:52.360 --> 04:54.360]  still live in.
[04:54.360 --> 05:23.360]  Then you find out the whole world is a cigarette burn crack whore.
[05:24.360 --> 05:43.360]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.

[05:58.360 --> 06:20.360]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[06:20.360 --> 06:32.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:32.360 --> 06:36.360]  We are live, my friends. It is the 15th day on this Monday.
[06:36.360 --> 06:40.360]  It is Monday, June 15th, 2009.
[06:40.360 --> 06:45.360]  We've got two hours left spanning out like a vista before us
[06:45.360 --> 06:49.360]  as we go in through and beyond as we talk to one of the most
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.360]  reality.
[06:51.360 --> 06:58.360]  He is a great dispenser of hundreds of millions of red pills to humanity.
[06:58.360 --> 07:02.360]  And he has taken on a lot of people very, very deep down the rabbit hole,
[07:02.360 --> 07:05.360]  indeed, where we're not in Kansas anymore.
[07:05.360 --> 07:09.360]  And you can question and debate the perceptions through the rose-colored
[07:09.360 --> 07:12.360]  darkly that David Ike looks through.
[07:12.360 --> 07:15.360]  But be careful that when you're getting a speck out of his eye,
[07:15.360 --> 07:18.360]  you don't get the giant beam out of yours.
[07:18.360 --> 07:20.360]  It's important to get that beam out.
[07:20.360 --> 07:22.360]  We all see through different perceptions.
[07:22.360 --> 07:26.360]  But certainly the perception of David Ike is proven to be much more clear
[07:26.360 --> 07:28.360]  than the average man or woman out there.
[07:28.360 --> 07:30.360]  So it's always great to have David with us.
[07:30.360 --> 07:32.360]  I have a host of issues I want to talk to him about.
[07:32.360 --> 07:34.360]  Where are the new orders going?
[07:34.360 --> 07:37.360]  What they're doing currently, trying to start World War III with Iran,
[07:37.360 --> 07:39.360]  trying to start things up over there,
[07:39.360 --> 07:41.360]  trying to start things up with North Korea,
[07:41.360 --> 07:44.360]  knowing they're in the middle of a power sharing and a power transfer,
[07:44.360 --> 07:46.360]  saying they're going to board their ships,
[07:46.360 --> 07:48.360]  a Cuban missile crisis.
[07:48.360 --> 07:50.360]  I think we're not defending North Korea or Iran.
[07:50.360 --> 07:52.360]  The point is, it's the bigger globalist evil
[07:52.360 --> 07:55.360]  using a smaller evil to bring in a global distraction.
[07:55.360 --> 08:00.360]  And the South Ossetia conflict, NATO encircling Russia, Pakistan,
[08:00.360 --> 08:03.360]  all of this today as the world launches into economic collapse,
[08:03.360 --> 08:06.360]  launches into worldwide warfare,
[08:06.360 --> 08:08.360]  as the Iran corporation is called for.
[08:08.360 --> 08:10.360]  So joining us at DavidIke.com is the website.
[08:10.360 --> 08:15.360]  Our websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com is the great David Ike.
[08:15.360 --> 08:17.360]  David Ike, thank you for joining us.
[08:17.360 --> 08:19.360]  It's a pleasure, Alex. How are you?
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.360]  Good. You heard me run down some of the ideas of things
[08:23.360 --> 08:25.360]  that I think are important right now.
[08:25.360 --> 08:28.360]  Let's start with, suddenly somebody flips a switch
[08:28.360 --> 08:30.360]  and there's world crises.
[08:30.360 --> 08:32.360]  We're on the edge of nuclear war.
[08:32.360 --> 08:34.360]  They're saying North Korea is going to nuke.
[08:34.360 --> 08:36.360]  They're saying they're going to nuke people.
[08:36.360 --> 08:38.360]  Months ago, you were on the show three or four months ago
[08:38.360 --> 08:42.360]  and you said you thought they were gearing up for a world war.
[08:42.360 --> 08:45.360]  Yeah, well, that's where they want to go
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.360]  because the world wars have served them very well.
[08:49.360 --> 08:53.360]  Nothing changes society quicker and more fundamentally
[08:53.360 --> 08:56.360]  and irreversibly than a war.
[08:56.360 --> 08:59.360]  And so when you look at the world after World War I,
[08:59.360 --> 09:03.360]  it was a world that was controlled by far fewer people
[09:03.360 --> 09:06.360]  and much more centralization of power than before.
[09:06.360 --> 09:08.360]  World War II came along.
[09:08.360 --> 09:10.360]  That process took a giant leap forward
[09:10.360 --> 09:13.360]  and we had all these global institutions
[09:13.360 --> 09:16.360]  and the United Nations, the Bretton Woods Agreement,
[09:16.360 --> 09:19.360]  the European Union was justified to a large extent
[09:19.360 --> 09:21.360]  to stopping war in Europe.
[09:21.360 --> 09:23.360]  And so to complete the job,
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.360]  to move into this final global society that they won,
[09:27.360 --> 09:31.360]  a Third World War is on the agenda.
[09:31.360 --> 09:34.360]  I don't know if I've mentioned this before,
[09:34.360 --> 09:37.360]  but I had a letter from a traffic warden,
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.360]  a guy here in Britain that's supposed to just dispense tickets
[09:42.360 --> 09:45.360]  for people who have broken the parking laws
[09:45.360 --> 09:49.360]  and he contacted me, must be a year or so ago now,
[09:49.360 --> 09:51.360]  and said that he'd been called in
[09:51.360 --> 09:55.360]  and given new cards that he was told to take home
[09:55.360 --> 09:57.360]  and put away until further notice.
[09:57.360 --> 10:00.360]  One of them was the card that gave him the right to be a traffic warden,
[10:00.360 --> 10:03.360]  that you show for identity, that's fair enough.
[10:03.360 --> 10:05.360]  The second one was what they called a PACE card,
[10:05.360 --> 10:07.360]  which is the words that a police officer reads
[10:07.360 --> 10:09.360]  when he's arresting someone.
[10:09.360 --> 10:12.360]  And the third one was a card giving him a traffic warden
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.360]  the right to enter property without permission.
[10:16.360 --> 10:19.360]  And of course, he's questioning what the heck do I need these for?
[10:19.360 --> 10:22.360]  Well, just go leave them until further notice.
[10:22.360 --> 10:24.360]  He then meets a friend of his a few days later,
[10:24.360 --> 10:26.360]  who's a police officer,
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.360]  and he said that this police officer said that
[10:30.360 --> 10:33.360]  he was a man designated in his county
[10:33.360 --> 10:35.360]  and there was someone like him in every county.
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.360]  And they were there to prepare for a coming war.
[10:39.360 --> 10:43.360]  And the military and the regular police
[10:43.360 --> 10:48.360]  were going to be used to meet
[10:48.360 --> 10:53.360]  what they knew was coming in terms of civil unrest in the streets
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.360]  when that war started and then they built up to that war.
[10:57.360 --> 11:00.360]  And he said, you people, traffic wardens
[11:00.360 --> 11:04.360]  and private security guards and other such people
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.360]  are going to be given powers that the police normally do
[11:09.360 --> 11:12.360]  so that you can do those things while we're dealing with the civil unrest
[11:12.360 --> 11:14.360]  as a result of this war.
[11:14.360 --> 11:20.360]  And very, very shortly after the traffic warden contacted me,
[11:20.360 --> 11:23.360]  the government changed the name of traffic wardens
[11:23.360 --> 11:26.360]  from traffic wardens to civil enforcement officers
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.360]  and gave them more powers, not all the powers,
[11:30.360 --> 11:32.360]  but more powers that the police normally do.
[11:32.360 --> 11:34.360]  And then about six months later,
[11:34.360 --> 11:37.360]  the government announced a new type of person
[11:37.360 --> 11:39.360]  called accredited persons.
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.360]  And these were, wait for it, private security guards
[11:43.360 --> 11:46.360]  and all the kind of people that the policeman had listed
[11:46.360 --> 11:50.360]  who were going to be given the right to stop
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.360]  and question people, to hand out certain fines
[11:54.360 --> 11:56.360]  to hold them till the police arrive.
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.360]  And it's all part of this layer by layer building
[12:00.360 --> 12:03.360]  of self-policing, the people self-policing each other
[12:03.360 --> 12:06.360]  because, of course, when there's a few of you
[12:06.360 --> 12:09.360]  and you've got, you've got to control the many,
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.360]  there's not enough of you physically to do it.
[12:12.360 --> 12:14.360]  So you have to get your target population
[12:14.360 --> 12:16.360]  or many of the people within it
[12:16.360 --> 12:18.360]  to police the target population.
[12:18.360 --> 12:21.360]  You have to get the sheep herd to police each other
[12:21.360 --> 12:25.360]  so they don't need so many sheepdogs externally
[12:25.360 --> 12:27.360]  and shepherds externally,
[12:27.360 --> 12:29.360]  that the sheep are doing it for themselves.
[12:29.360 --> 12:32.360]  And this is what's being built all over the world.
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.360]  And this Third World War is definitely in the agenda
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.360]  because it's a massive problem,
[12:38.360 --> 12:41.360]  which will be in need of a global,
[12:41.360 --> 12:43.360]  because of the global nature of the conflict,
[12:43.360 --> 12:47.360]  a global solution, which will be the final move
[12:47.360 --> 12:50.360]  to this structure we've been talking about all these years
[12:50.360 --> 12:52.360]  of world government, world army, and all the rest of it.
[12:52.360 --> 12:55.360]  Of course, the world army will be justified by
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.360]  the only way to stop war is to have one world army
[12:58.360 --> 13:00.360]  and then no one can fight each other
[13:00.360 --> 13:02.360]  in terms of major conflicts anymore.
[13:02.360 --> 13:05.360]  These are the kind of things we're going to be seeing unfolding.
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.360]  Okay, David, I just want to back you up.
[13:08.360 --> 13:11.360]  Everything David just said,
[13:11.360 --> 13:13.360]  every term he used,
[13:13.360 --> 13:15.360]  I have hundreds of mainstream articles,
[13:15.360 --> 13:17.360]  government documents, let me just go over a few of them.
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.360]  The British Ministry of Defense 10-year report,
[13:21.360 --> 13:23.360]  London Guardian reported on it,
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.360]  that was declassified, 120 pages,
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.360]  was put out in September of 2007
[13:29.360 --> 13:32.360]  and said in the coming next few years,
[13:32.360 --> 13:35.360]  the public would rebel against the corrupt government,
[13:35.360 --> 13:38.360]  but that their job was to suppress the public
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.360]  to bring us into this new world order.
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.360]  And it said they will, even if the British people,
[13:43.360 --> 13:45.360]  they say try to march on London,
[13:45.360 --> 13:47.360]  they will use neutron bombs on them.
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.360]  And then Dick Cheney said in the PNAC documents
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.360]  September 20th, 2000,
[13:50.360 --> 13:52.360]  we're building America's defenses,
[13:52.360 --> 13:57.360]  that they would use race-specific bio weapons on us.
[13:57.360 --> 14:01.360]  And now another layer under the paramilitary,
[14:01.360 --> 14:03.360]  you know, the spooks, the paramilitary,
[14:03.360 --> 14:05.360]  the police, the traffic wardens,
[14:05.360 --> 14:07.360]  auxiliary tattletales,
[14:07.360 --> 14:09.360]  there's now the trusted traveler,
[14:09.360 --> 14:11.360]  North American hemispheric card,
[14:11.360 --> 14:13.360]  and if you have that flying internally,
[14:13.360 --> 14:15.360]  say from Austin to New York,
[14:15.360 --> 14:17.360]  you show that and go through the head of the line.
[14:17.360 --> 14:19.360]  So they're already making it that if you wave all your rights
[14:19.360 --> 14:21.360]  and take the special card,
[14:21.360 --> 14:23.360]  you get to the head of the line,
[14:23.360 --> 14:25.360]  then they're just going to make it mandatory for everybody.
[14:25.360 --> 14:26.360]  David, I.
[14:26.360 --> 14:27.360]  Well, that's what they do.
[14:27.360 --> 14:30.360]  I mean, they say, oh, this will be voluntary
[14:30.360 --> 14:32.360]  for the people to decide if they want to have it
[14:32.360 --> 14:35.360]  like identity cards and stuff like that.
[14:35.360 --> 14:38.360]  But what they then do is make it so difficult
[14:38.360 --> 14:40.360]  to operate in society without one of them.
[14:40.360 --> 14:42.360]  And eventually they say, well,
[14:42.360 --> 14:44.360]  there's so few people that don't have them now
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.360]  where everyone might as well have them by law
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.360]  and all the rest of it.
[14:47.360 --> 14:48.360]  These are the techniques they use.
[14:48.360 --> 14:51.360]  And of course, as we've talked about before on the show,
[14:51.360 --> 14:56.360]  Bush was the problem part of this presidential handover,
[14:56.360 --> 14:58.360]  and Obama's been brought in
[14:58.360 --> 15:01.360]  as the person offering the solutions.
[15:01.360 --> 15:03.360]  And of course, the solutions are going to be
[15:03.360 --> 15:04.360]  the unfolding agenda.
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.360]  And one of his solutions, of course,
[15:06.360 --> 15:09.360]  is this civil army in effect
[15:09.360 --> 15:10.360]  that he's been talking about,
[15:10.360 --> 15:12.360]  and Rahm Emanuel has been talking about.
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.360]  And that is another key layer of this police,
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.360]  policing of the people by the people,
[15:19.360 --> 15:21.360]  which is what you had in Nazi Germany.
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.360]  And that's what tyranny is always doing.
[15:24.360 --> 15:26.360]  You know, people have got to decide
[15:26.360 --> 15:29.360]  how long we're going to talk about this
[15:29.360 --> 15:32.360]  before we draw a line in the sand and say, hey,
[15:32.360 --> 15:37.360]  instead of sitting here and watching our prison being built
[15:37.360 --> 15:40.360]  and discussing it and debating it,
[15:40.360 --> 15:41.360]  what the heck are we going to do about it?
[15:41.360 --> 15:43.360]  Because there's going to come a point
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.360]  where we're going to cross a line,
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.360]  where this momentum is going to be very difficult to turn back.
[15:49.360 --> 15:52.360]  It needs a lot of people with a lot of focus
[15:52.360 --> 15:55.360]  and a lot of disconnection of back sides from sofas
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.360]  now before this gets completely and utterly out of hand.
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.360]  This is Alex Jones.
[16:02.360 --> 16:04.360]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[16:04.360 --> 16:05.360]  Well, you should.
[16:05.360 --> 16:07.360]  He has a free handgun
[16:07.360 --> 16:10.360]  and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[16:10.360 --> 16:11.360]  That's right.
[16:11.360 --> 16:14.360]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training
[16:14.360 --> 16:16.360]  at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[16:16.360 --> 16:19.360]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit,
[16:19.360 --> 16:21.360]  all for pennies on the dollar.
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.360]  Plus, if you act fast,
[16:22.360 --> 16:24.360]  the millionaire patriot will give you a free
[16:24.360 --> 16:26.360]  Springfield Armory XD pistol
[16:26.360 --> 16:28.360]  in the caliber of your choice.
[16:28.360 --> 16:30.360]  I believe now is the time that you and your family
[16:30.360 --> 16:31.360]  need to be armed and trained
[16:31.360 --> 16:34.360]  to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[16:34.360 --> 16:36.360]  Front Sight provides such training
[16:36.360 --> 16:38.360]  without any boot camp mentality
[16:38.360 --> 16:40.360]  or drill instructor attitudes.
[16:40.360 --> 16:41.360]  This is real.
[16:41.360 --> 16:42.360]  Don't miss out.
[16:42.360 --> 16:45.360]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course
[16:45.360 --> 16:48.360]  plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit
[16:48.360 --> 16:50.360]  for pennies on the dollar.
[16:50.360 --> 16:51.360]  And get your free handgun.
[16:51.360 --> 16:53.360]  Go to FrontSight.com today.
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.360]  That's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[16:57.360 --> 16:59.360]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training
[16:59.360 --> 17:01.360]  and free gun.
[17:01.360 --> 17:03.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons.
[17:03.360 --> 17:06.360]  You should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[17:06.360 --> 17:08.360]  Number one, new climate legislation
[17:08.360 --> 17:10.360]  could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[17:10.360 --> 17:12.360]  Number two, our new energy czar
[17:12.360 --> 17:14.360]  wants to control how much power
[17:14.360 --> 17:16.360]  your electric company allows you to have.
[17:16.360 --> 17:17.360]  It's true.
[17:17.360 --> 17:19.360]  Total government control of electricity
[17:19.360 --> 17:21.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[17:21.360 --> 17:23.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[17:23.360 --> 17:25.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[17:27.360 --> 17:29.360]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[17:29.360 --> 17:31.360]  summer storm season is here again.
[17:31.360 --> 17:33.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[17:33.360 --> 17:35.360]  from weather-related outages.
[17:35.360 --> 17:37.360]  Number five, a solar power generator
[17:37.360 --> 17:39.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[17:39.360 --> 17:42.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[17:42.360 --> 17:44.360]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[17:44.360 --> 17:46.360]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[17:46.360 --> 17:50.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[17:50.360 --> 17:52.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[18:26.360 --> 18:28.360]  Number two, that's safe from E. coli,
[18:28.360 --> 18:30.360]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[18:30.360 --> 18:32.360]  And they do it at almost half the cost
[18:32.360 --> 18:34.360]  of last year's grocery prices.

[19:30.360 --> 19:59.360]  Thanks for watching.
[20:00.360 --> 20:26.360]  I'm David Ike with us for another hour and 35 minutes.
[20:26.360 --> 20:31.360]  What David here is talking about is so important.
[20:31.360 --> 20:35.360]  When you're in a view above yourself outside the world
[20:35.360 --> 20:39.360]  realizing that this is a biological earth suit
[20:39.360 --> 20:43.360]  and that the system knows how to program it
[20:43.360 --> 20:48.360]  with hormones and drugs and war and feedback and sex.
[20:48.360 --> 20:51.360]  When they use sex to sell Calvin Klein genes,
[20:51.360 --> 20:55.360]  they are going at your primitive sexual centers
[20:55.360 --> 20:57.360]  in your lower brain.
[20:57.360 --> 21:00.360]  Just to get the public to realize they're being bombarded,
[21:00.360 --> 21:03.360]  they're being programmed, if you can get them to do that,
[21:03.360 --> 21:05.360]  they kind of wake up out of the trance,
[21:05.360 --> 21:08.360]  realize you're being bombarded, realize there's a game.
[21:08.360 --> 21:11.360]  I don't know how to quantify this, David,
[21:11.360 --> 21:14.360]  but to me the term I would use is just realize
[21:14.360 --> 21:17.360]  that you are being bombarded with data,
[21:17.360 --> 21:20.360]  realize that there is a manipulation going on
[21:20.360 --> 21:22.360]  knowing it's half the battle.
[21:22.360 --> 21:24.360]  This is so important.
[21:24.360 --> 21:27.360]  In my talks I put some pictures on the screen
[21:27.360 --> 21:30.360]  which are subliminal advertisements.
[21:30.360 --> 21:33.360]  Most people, the vast majority of people, can't see them
[21:33.360 --> 21:37.360]  because that's what subliminal is, below threshold.
[21:37.360 --> 21:39.360]  The conscious mind doesn't see them,
[21:39.360 --> 21:41.360]  which the conscious mind actually sees very little
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.360]  compared with what actually is in front of it.
[21:43.360 --> 21:46.360]  The subconscious mind, however, picks it all up
[21:46.360 --> 21:49.360]  and affects the person's reality without them realizing it
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.360]  by the message that's been passed through the subliminal image.
[21:53.360 --> 21:58.360]  Then I will put the picture back up again a few minutes later
[21:58.360 --> 22:02.360]  and the first thing you see once it's been pointed out
[22:02.360 --> 22:05.360]  when you see the picture again is the subliminal.
[22:05.360 --> 22:10.360]  When people start to realize how it's being done to them,
[22:10.360 --> 22:13.360]  then they bring it from below threshold,
[22:13.360 --> 22:15.360]  subliminal, to the conscious awareness
[22:15.360 --> 22:20.360]  and the defences go up, which they don't have to think about.
[22:20.360 --> 22:23.360]  Naturally the defences up once the conscious mind is aware
[22:23.360 --> 22:25.360]  of the game it's involved in.
[22:25.360 --> 22:31.360]  We need to understand the fundamental significance
[22:31.360 --> 22:35.360]  to the whole conspiracy of something called the reptilian brain.
[22:35.360 --> 22:39.360]  The reptilian brain is where we get along with other parts of the brain
[22:39.360 --> 22:42.360]  but massively the reptilian brain, our survival instincts.
[22:42.360 --> 22:45.360]  The reptilian brain is basically stupid.
[22:45.360 --> 22:46.360]  David, let me stop you.
[22:46.360 --> 22:49.360]  This is not debatable about the reptilian brain.
[22:49.360 --> 22:51.360]  This is a scientific name.
[22:51.360 --> 22:53.360]  I put it up on the screen, Google reptilian brain
[22:53.360 --> 22:55.360]  and show them like a textbook area.
[22:55.360 --> 23:01.360]  That's the lower brain that's breathing, sex, eating, wanting to kill people.
[23:01.360 --> 23:05.360]  I'm just interrupting you because some may think,
[23:05.360 --> 23:08.360]  oh, this is David Eich and his other issues with that.
[23:08.360 --> 23:12.360]  The scientists call it the R-complex or the reptilian brain
[23:12.360 --> 23:15.360]  because the way it functions and the way it reacts
[23:15.360 --> 23:19.360]  is almost exactly like the brain of a reptile or a lizard.
[23:19.360 --> 23:20.360]  But it is.
[23:20.360 --> 23:23.360]  In fact, students, as my dad went to medical school,
[23:23.360 --> 23:28.360]  students shown a salt crocodile brain can't tell the difference
[23:28.360 --> 23:30.360]  with a human lower brain.
[23:30.360 --> 23:34.360]  We basically do have a salt crocodile brain.
[23:34.360 --> 23:40.360]  What happens is that those behind the dark suits,
[23:40.360 --> 23:43.360]  those in the shadows, they'll understand all this stuff
[23:43.360 --> 23:47.360]  and have worked constantly for centuries to take it out of circulation
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.360]  among the people so they're in ignorance of the very means
[23:51.360 --> 23:53.360]  through which they're being manipulated.
[23:53.360 --> 23:57.360]  They understand this and they target the reptilian brain.
[23:57.360 --> 23:59.360]  The reptilian brain is basically stupid.
[23:59.360 --> 24:01.360]  It's a reaction system.
[24:01.360 --> 24:04.360]  It is so computer-like, it's incredible.
[24:04.360 --> 24:10.360]  At that level, the brain does just react like a computer on a desktop
[24:10.360 --> 24:13.360]  and it doesn't learn from experience.
[24:13.360 --> 24:16.360]  Other parts of the brain learn from experience.
[24:16.360 --> 24:18.360]  The reptilian brain doesn't.
[24:18.360 --> 24:20.360]  Its survival instincts are total.
[24:20.360 --> 24:25.360]  It's constantly scanning the environment looking for possible dangers
[24:25.360 --> 24:27.360]  as it perceives them.
[24:27.360 --> 24:31.360]  The idea of the manipulation is to give the reptilian brain
[24:31.360 --> 24:37.360]  more and more and more reasons to see things in terms of a threat
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.360]  or a danger because then all rational thinking disappears,
[24:41.360 --> 24:45.360]  all calm reflection, and let's look at this calmly, disappears,
[24:45.360 --> 24:49.360]  because the reptilian brain is basically just reacting in a panic.
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.360]  Save me, save me, I want me mom, that's what it's doing.
[24:53.360 --> 24:55.360]  The reptilian brain, interestingly,
[24:55.360 --> 24:58.360]  if we get into this way that people are programmed,
[24:58.360 --> 25:02.360]  communicates through images.
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.360]  This is why images in advertising are so powerful in their manipulation
[25:06.360 --> 25:07.360]  of the reptilian brain.
[25:07.360 --> 25:10.360]  Which, as you quite rightly point out, is the sexual center.
[25:10.360 --> 25:11.360]  Why?
[25:11.360 --> 25:13.360]  Because with the reptilian brain,
[25:13.360 --> 25:16.360]  you have to keep one word in your mind all the time, survival.
[25:16.360 --> 25:19.360]  Well, David Ike, I heartily agree with you
[25:19.360 --> 25:23.360]  and we're going to talk about a host of issues today.
[25:23.360 --> 25:25.360]  And later in the next hour,
[25:25.360 --> 25:27.360]  let's get into some of your ideas for solutions
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.360]  and breaking free of this matrix.
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.360]  In fact, let's go ahead and start talking about some of that now.
[25:34.360 --> 25:36.360]  Coming up in the next segment,
[25:36.360 --> 25:42.360]  I'm going to play a video clip from a satire movie about sitcoms.
[25:42.360 --> 25:45.360]  But when you watch it,
[25:45.360 --> 25:48.360]  it actually has the same messages that really are
[25:48.360 --> 25:50.360]  in the children's programming and the sitcoms.
[25:50.360 --> 25:52.360]  And they're dumbing the language down
[25:52.360 --> 25:54.360]  and they're reducing the language.
[25:54.360 --> 25:57.360]  People are being inserted into the matrix
[25:57.360 --> 26:00.360]  as the eyes tie into the television and the computers
[26:00.360 --> 26:02.360]  and people are texting to their friends
[26:02.360 --> 26:05.360]  who are five feet away instead of talking to them.
[26:05.360 --> 26:08.360]  We are beginning to merge into the machines.
[26:08.360 --> 26:09.360]  We're not programming them.
[26:09.360 --> 26:11.360]  We're being programmed through the machines
[26:11.360 --> 26:13.360]  that have been programmed to program us.
[26:13.360 --> 26:16.360]  And the consciousness is closing down
[26:16.360 --> 26:18.360]  with large swaths of the public.
[26:18.360 --> 26:20.360]  While at the same time,
[26:20.360 --> 26:24.360]  another large group is exploding their awakening
[26:24.360 --> 26:27.360]  and how you see this battle unfolding
[26:27.360 --> 26:31.360]  as we rush towards what the establishment calls the singularity.
[26:31.360 --> 26:34.360]  This is my area really in so many ways
[26:34.360 --> 26:37.360]  because particularly since about 2002-2003
[26:37.360 --> 26:40.360]  I've really gone very, very deeply into the nature of reality
[26:40.360 --> 26:43.360]  which not many people tend to do.
[26:43.360 --> 26:46.360]  And when you start to realize what reality is,
[26:46.360 --> 26:48.360]  my goodness, does society as it's structured
[26:48.360 --> 26:51.360]  and the way it's structured start to make perfect sense.
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.360]  First of all, it's so important to realize
[26:55.360 --> 26:57.360]  the difference between the body and consciousness.
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.360]  It's not the same thing.
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.360]  Now, you know, we may have differing religions.
[27:03.360 --> 27:05.360]  Different people listen to this show.
[27:05.360 --> 27:08.360]  But one thing is kind of common to them
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.360]  is that some kind of consciousness, soul, whatever you want to call it
[27:12.360 --> 27:17.360]  is apart from the body and leaves the body at what we call death.
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.360]  Therefore, the body and the soul, the consciousness,
[27:22.360 --> 27:24.360]  whatever you want to call it, are not the same thing.
[27:24.360 --> 27:27.360]  The idea of the conspiracy,
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.360]  the very bottom line of the conspiracy
[27:29.360 --> 27:32.360]  is to disconnect those higher levels of awareness
[27:32.360 --> 27:36.360]  from what is a computer, the body, the body is a biological computer.
[27:36.360 --> 27:39.360]  And it ticks every single box of that.
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.360]  And what I mean by biological is it's not like a desktop computer
[27:43.360 --> 27:45.360]  where you put data in and you press a button
[27:45.360 --> 27:47.360]  and you know exactly what it's going to do
[27:47.360 --> 27:49.360]  because it's programmed to do that,
[27:49.360 --> 27:51.360]  although we're getting more and more like that.
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.360]  Biological computer means it has the ability to think and assess data.
[27:54.360 --> 27:56.360]  This is what the immune system is doing all the time.
[27:56.360 --> 27:59.360]  It's scanning data, what's happening in the body, and reacting to it.
[27:59.360 --> 28:03.360]  It sees fit in the circumstances that it faces.
[28:03.360 --> 28:08.360]  The idea of the conspiracy is to pull people's sense of awareness,
[28:08.360 --> 28:11.360]  the point from which they observe the world,
[28:11.360 --> 28:15.360]  from consciousness, which is not in this world,
[28:15.360 --> 28:18.360]  it is observing and experiencing this world through the body,
[28:18.360 --> 28:21.360]  to pull that point of awareness into the body.
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.360]  Because once it does that, it's pulled you into the computer level of awareness,
[28:25.360 --> 28:28.360]  the computer level of sense of reality.
[28:28.360 --> 28:31.360]  And what that does, it pulls you into all the programs
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.360]  that are running through the body, like software programs.
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.360]  And these are all reaction programs which get you to react to data,
[28:39.360 --> 28:41.360]  i.e. situations they create in the world,
[28:41.360 --> 28:44.360]  in precisely the way they want us to react.
[28:44.360 --> 28:47.360]  So we become little more than biological robots,
[28:47.360 --> 28:50.360]  which is where most people in this world are.
[28:50.360 --> 28:54.360]  More and more, I mean, I've always known this concept to be true.
[28:54.360 --> 28:57.360]  I've been a scientist and mine were for experts' sake,
[28:57.360 --> 29:00.360]  but now I'm consciously really realizing it.
[29:00.360 --> 29:28.360]  This is Alex Jones.
[29:31.360 --> 29:34.360]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[29:34.360 --> 29:36.360]  Try the Nutra Cafe.
[29:36.360 --> 29:39.360]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides
[29:39.360 --> 29:41.360]  that boosts the immune system.
[29:41.360 --> 29:43.360]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.360]  And take it from me, folks, it really does taste great.
[29:46.360 --> 30:01.360]  Try their other great products.
[30:01.360 --> 30:04.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[30:04.360 --> 30:06.360]  buying a solar power generator this summer.
[30:06.360 --> 30:10.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:10.360 --> 30:12.360]  Number two, our new energies are,
[30:12.360 --> 30:16.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[30:16.360 --> 30:19.360]  It's true, total government control of electricity
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:21.360 --> 30:23.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[30:23.360 --> 30:25.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[30:25.360 --> 30:28.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[30:28.360 --> 30:31.360]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[30:31.360 --> 30:33.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[30:33.360 --> 30:35.360]  from weather related outages.
[30:35.360 --> 30:37.360]  Number five, a solar power generator
[30:37.360 --> 30:40.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:40.360 --> 30:42.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[30:42.360 --> 30:44.360]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[30:44.360 --> 30:46.360]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[30:46.360 --> 30:50.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[30:50.360 --> 30:52.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[30:52.360 --> 30:55.360]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[31:01.360 --> 31:02.360]  This is Alex Jones.
[31:02.360 --> 31:04.360]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[31:04.360 --> 31:05.360]  Well, you should.
[31:05.360 --> 31:09.360]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[31:09.360 --> 31:10.360]  That's right.
[31:10.360 --> 31:13.360]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training
[31:13.360 --> 31:16.360]  at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[31:16.360 --> 31:19.360]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit,
[31:19.360 --> 31:20.360]  all for pennies on the dollar.
[31:20.360 --> 31:23.360]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free
[31:23.360 --> 31:27.360]  Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[31:27.360 --> 31:30.360]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.360]  and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[31:34.360 --> 31:38.360]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[31:38.360 --> 31:40.360]  or drill instructor attitudes.

[32:01.360 --> 32:02.360]  Hello, friends.
[32:02.360 --> 32:03.360]  This is Alex Jones.
[32:03.360 --> 32:06.360]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[32:06.360 --> 32:08.360]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[32:08.360 --> 32:09.360]  We need to be independent.
[32:09.360 --> 32:11.360]  And food and water is the key.
[32:11.360 --> 32:13.360]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[32:13.360 --> 32:14.360]  when you have your own bread.
[32:14.360 --> 32:16.360]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[32:16.360 --> 32:18.360]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[32:18.360 --> 32:20.360]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[32:20.360 --> 32:23.360]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[32:23.360 --> 32:26.360]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food
[32:26.360 --> 32:30.360]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[32:30.360 --> 32:33.360]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[32:33.360 --> 32:38.360]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[32:38.360 --> 32:42.360]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the find list of high quality,
[32:42.360 --> 32:45.360]  freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[32:45.360 --> 32:46.360]  Watch the free videos.
[32:46.360 --> 32:51.360]  Look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[32:51.360 --> 32:56.360]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[32:56.360 --> 32:57.360]  Take action today.
[32:57.360 --> 33:04.360]  The first step is getting storable food.
[33:04.360 --> 33:23.360]  All the leaves are brown, the leaves are bright, and the sky is blue.
[33:23.360 --> 33:34.360]  There's a man going around taking names, and he decides who to free and who to blame.
[33:34.360 --> 33:39.360]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.360]  There will be a golden ladder reaching down.
[33:42.360 --> 33:44.360]  You know what Revelation talks about?
[33:44.360 --> 33:50.360]  How the kings of the earth traffic in the souls of men.
[33:50.360 --> 33:56.360]  You read the old fables and it describes kingdoms that were under spells
[33:56.360 --> 33:58.360]  where they couldn't see corruption, couldn't see lies.
[33:58.360 --> 34:03.360]  Once you've committed to lies, little lies, then you start buying into the bigger ones.
[34:03.360 --> 34:04.360]  Torture is okay.
[34:04.360 --> 34:06.360]  Secret arrest is okay.
[34:06.360 --> 34:07.360]  We're the good guys.
[34:07.360 --> 34:10.360]  We're a country that loves death and destruction.
[34:10.360 --> 34:22.360]  When you read the psychologists, the sociologists, the anthropologists, the psychiatrists,
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.360]  the ember-bernays 80, 90 years ago, they all brag how we're dumb slaves.
[34:26.360 --> 34:32.360]  They all brag how they're programming us, how they're manipulating us, how they control everything we do.
[34:32.360 --> 34:38.360]  They're on incredible power trips, and they put on this fake liberal facade,
[34:38.360 --> 34:41.360]  but they're a bunch of cold-blooded trash breaking up the family,
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.360]  all their major textbooks that we've shown you here say the family's their enemy.
[34:45.360 --> 34:49.360]  You know, when people say, oh, they want to break the family up, or oh, they want to dumb us down,
[34:49.360 --> 34:52.360]  that isn't just a figment of imagination.
[34:52.360 --> 34:58.360]  That's not just a statement or a verbal fancy.
[34:58.360 --> 35:04.360]  It's the reality, and it's a group of humans setting up a predatory system
[35:04.360 --> 35:08.360]  where they engage in their predator hunting mode against their own people,
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.360]  and they're breeding us and dumbing us down to be more easily controlled.
[35:12.360 --> 35:14.360]  That's what David Ike's talking about.
[35:14.360 --> 35:17.360]  I just took two years of RTF, radio, television, film.
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.360]  The first textbook was all about subliminal messages on radio 80 years ago,
[35:22.360 --> 35:26.360]  and TV 60 years ago, and in movie theaters, and how the billboards have it,
[35:26.360 --> 35:30.360]  and how they use sex to sell, and how they're hitting the reptilian brain.
[35:30.360 --> 35:37.360]  This is a fact, and so they're feeding through this virtual matrix, and that's what it is.
[35:37.360 --> 35:39.360]  It's not a physical matrix with us in tanks.
[35:39.360 --> 35:46.360]  It's our brain in a tank inside this body suit being programmed by the false world,
[35:46.360 --> 35:49.360]  by the image makers of television and Madison Avenue,
[35:49.360 --> 35:54.360]  to keep us off the real world and the whole universe around us through fear,
[35:54.360 --> 35:58.360]  through the desire for money, sex, survival, all of this.
[35:58.360 --> 36:00.360]  But when you do what Christ said and turn loose,
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.360]  he that gives up his life gains his life, he that tries to save it loses it.
[36:05.360 --> 36:08.360]  That means when you're ready to give it all up and just don't care anymore
[36:08.360 --> 36:13.360]  and stop letting that program totally control you, then you go to the next level.
[36:13.360 --> 36:16.360]  And that doesn't mean we don't bounce back and forth between the higher mind,
[36:16.360 --> 36:21.360]  the cerebral cortex, where they say the cognitive and the soul's dwelling,
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.360]  and if you don't believe that, fine, that's your issue.
[36:24.360 --> 36:30.360]  The animal brain, regardless, through this electrochemical computer,
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.360]  we are being programmed and manipulated, and the establishment brags about it,
[36:34.360 --> 36:38.360]  and they put compulsions and mental blocks in you through culture, through television,
[36:38.360 --> 36:43.360]  through the jokes they make on TV that then are repeated by people on the ground
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.360]  giving it reality in this plane of existence, not in the cyber world,
[36:48.360 --> 36:51.360]  the make-believe TV world that's now becoming reality,
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.360]  that it's not kosher to talk about these things,
[36:54.360 --> 36:56.360]  and so people are in a prison for their mind.
[36:56.360 --> 36:58.360]  David Ike, please continue.
[36:58.360 --> 37:01.360]  I've been talking about this paper in front of me,
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.360]  and I've just been ticking off little things, issues that you brought up,
[37:07.360 --> 37:11.360]  and they come under one heading, the reptilian brain.
[37:11.360 --> 37:14.360]  From the reptilian brain, we get all the survival mechanisms, yes,
[37:14.360 --> 37:23.360]  which break out into multiple different expressions of what the brain perceives to be necessary to survive from,
[37:23.360 --> 37:25.360]  but we get cold, bloody behavior.
[37:25.360 --> 37:28.360]  We get the desire for power over.
[37:28.360 --> 37:32.360]  Power over comes from survival, the idea that if you have power over,
[37:32.360 --> 37:35.360]  then you've got a much greater chance of survival.
[37:35.360 --> 37:38.360]  It's the reptilian brains where we get a ritualistic behavior.
[37:38.360 --> 37:43.360]  I mean, these guys cause a big time into their satanic rituals,
[37:43.360 --> 37:52.360]  but if you look at human society, Alex, it's just a daily repeating of ritual repeating behavior.
[37:52.360 --> 37:57.360]  The reptilian brain, we get the desire for top-down, hierarchical structures of power.
[37:57.360 --> 37:59.360]  Look at the world.
[37:59.360 --> 38:02.360]  It's an expression of the reptilian brain.
[38:02.360 --> 38:05.360]  You were talking there about addictions.
[38:05.360 --> 38:11.360]  Well, addictions come from the reptilian brain, addiction to money, addiction to sex, addiction to drugs,
[38:11.360 --> 38:18.360]  and then you look at the survival mechanisms and how they play out through problem-reaction solution.
[38:18.360 --> 38:25.360]  When they say, oh, swine flu, pandemic, what are they saying that to?
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.360]  They're saying it to the survival responses in the reptilian brain of, oh, my God, survival, do something.
[38:31.360 --> 38:33.360]  Yes, compulsory vaccination.
[38:33.360 --> 38:34.360]  If anything, terrorism.
[38:34.360 --> 38:36.360]  Oh, yes, war on terror.
[38:36.360 --> 38:38.360]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[38:38.360 --> 38:39.360]  Yes, in vain Iraq.
[38:39.360 --> 38:40.360]  Oh, yes, anything.
[38:40.360 --> 38:46.360]  Oh, my God, it's all through the reptilian brain because they understand how it works and we need to understand how it works
[38:46.360 --> 38:53.360]  because once we do that, the defense mechanisms start to go up and also we can start to observe our own behavior.
[38:53.360 --> 39:03.360]  When we're reacting to things in an emotional way without calm thinking, then we can stop.
[39:03.360 --> 39:06.360]  I mean, I've been working on this for years now in myself.
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.360]  You get halfway through a sentence and you stop and you know, you think, no, that's the reptilian brain being activated.
[39:11.360 --> 39:19.360]  And what you're doing as you do that, as you recognize it, is you're stopping it having that reactive power over you that it had before
[39:19.360 --> 39:28.360]  and you move into other parts of the brain in terms of the way that you filter reality and information and situations.
[39:28.360 --> 39:29.360]  And those get more developed.
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.360]  You start seeing the universe more and more through the higher levels of the brain
[39:33.360 --> 39:37.360]  and then knowledge just explosively opens where you can't even describe it.
[39:37.360 --> 39:46.360]  Well, how can you accumulate real knowledge and awareness when you're spending the day reacting emotionally all the time?
[39:46.360 --> 39:52.360]  And I would say to people, because you know, I'm not sitting cross-legged on a mountain here saying, hey, I'm the Buddha.
[39:52.360 --> 39:54.360]  I'm telling you all how it is and I'm perfect.
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.360]  We all are in these biological computers.
[39:59.360 --> 40:03.360]  The question is, are we going to let them live us or are we going to live them?
[40:03.360 --> 40:06.360]  Are we going to live life or are we going to allow life to live us?
[40:06.360 --> 40:10.360]  Because most people allow life to live them because of these reactive processes.
[40:10.360 --> 40:16.360]  Well, that's what John Carpenter is saying is they live the controllers we sleep.
[40:16.360 --> 40:21.360]  We're sleeping when we're in the reptilian brain also tied into sleep.
[40:21.360 --> 40:22.360]  We are unconscious.
[40:22.360 --> 40:25.360]  We're really dead and they live.
[40:25.360 --> 40:27.360]  It's all a big joke to them.
[40:27.360 --> 40:40.360]  Yeah, and if we can start to take control of our reactions and when you kind of come from this point of view and you just observe yourself for a few days,
[40:40.360 --> 40:51.360]  just observe yourself in the way you react and you'll see how many conflicts between individuals, arguments, emotional responses that are right over the top
[40:51.360 --> 40:58.360]  and the way that we immediately react to something instead of saying, hold on a second, take a deep breath.
[40:58.360 --> 41:01.360]  Let's just calmly look at this before we start making instant decisions.
[41:01.360 --> 41:09.360]  When you do that, you realize how many times a day the reptilian brain decides your decisions for you.
[41:09.360 --> 41:11.360]  It's unbelievable the number of times it happens.
[41:11.360 --> 41:16.360]  And collectively, of course, there's a collective version of this where you have the mob rule and all the rest of it,
[41:16.360 --> 41:24.360]  where the reptilian brain is manipulated collectively to have a collective response and emotional reaction.
[41:24.360 --> 41:32.360]  And we've got to get control of the computer system through our consciousness instead of having our consciousness at the back of the bus
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.360]  and the computer system with its hands on the wheel because that's what the conspiracy is about.
[41:36.360 --> 41:38.360]  While we're there, they got us.
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.360]  When we're not there, they've lost their ability to connect into us and therefore manipulate our perceptions.
[41:43.360 --> 41:48.360]  All right, let me expand on that because this has been scientifically proven, as you know,
[41:48.360 --> 41:52.360]  but for listeners who may not buy thousands of universities for over 100 years,
[41:52.360 --> 42:01.360]  that mice and other animals know when a hurricane or an earthquake is coming days or sometimes weeks beforehand.
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.360]  They can also do double-blind studies where there's a 20-foot wall.
[42:05.360 --> 42:12.360]  You can't hear what's going on in the next room, but if people are agitated in the next room or being hurt, brainwaves,
[42:12.360 --> 42:21.360]  you know, go into a pattern of this array or being upset yourself, kind of that hundredth monkey,
[42:21.360 --> 42:28.360]  and the system is trying to suppress this awakening or, you know, I mean, just in scientific terms,
[42:28.360 --> 42:33.360]  from people being, you know, at a higher level when it comes to the use of their brain.
[42:33.360 --> 42:36.360]  So that's why they're putting the fluoride in the water.
[42:36.360 --> 42:38.360]  That's why they're injecting us with mercury.
[42:38.360 --> 42:40.360]  That's why they're feeding us the GMO food.
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.360]  All of this, and that's why the television's dumbing everything down, lowering everything down.
[42:45.360 --> 42:50.360]  How do you see this battle shaking out, David?
[42:50.360 --> 43:11.360]  Well, if we don't become conscious and get out of control by computer programs, then it's going to go on.
[43:21.360 --> 43:25.360]  In our food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[43:25.360 --> 43:27.360]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.360]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works.
[43:31.360 --> 43:34.360]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[43:34.360 --> 43:36.360]  Try the Nutra Cafe.
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.360]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[43:40.360 --> 43:43.360]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[43:43.360 --> 43:44.360]  And take it from me, folks.
[43:44.360 --> 43:45.360]  It really does taste great.
[43:45.360 --> 43:47.360]  Don't forget to try their other great products.

[46:01.360 --> 46:06.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[46:06.360 --> 46:10.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[46:10.360 --> 46:16.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[46:16.360 --> 46:17.360]  It's true.
[46:17.360 --> 46:21.360]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[46:21.360 --> 46:25.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[46:25.360 --> 46:28.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[46:28.360 --> 46:31.360]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[46:35.360 --> 46:40.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[46:40.360 --> 46:46.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.
[46:46.360 --> 46:50.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[46:50.360 --> 46:52.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[46:52.360 --> 46:55.360]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[46:55.360 --> 47:01.360]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[47:14.360 --> 47:16.360]  Ease the T-rex of political talk.
[47:16.360 --> 47:23.360]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:30.360 --> 47:32.360]  Your calls are coming up with David I.
[47:32.360 --> 47:34.360]  He's been very, very nice to give us two hours today.
[47:34.360 --> 47:38.360]  We're very, very thankful to tell you about something speaking engagements that are coming up here in just a moment.
[47:38.360 --> 47:40.360]  So meet your pen and paper ready.
[47:40.360 --> 47:42.360]  We're talking to the folks involved with the 2012 film.
[47:42.360 --> 47:43.360]  That's all I can say.
[47:43.360 --> 47:46.360]  I'm not even allowed to show the revision numbers of this.
[47:46.360 --> 47:49.360]  But I have the 2012 script with Woody Harrelson.
[47:49.360 --> 47:50.360]  I will just tell you that.
[47:50.360 --> 47:51.360]  That just came in the mail.
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.360]  I want to thank folks for that.
[47:53.360 --> 47:59.360]  Going back to David, you got cut off there talking about the frequency.
[47:59.360 --> 48:03.360]  Talking about how the globalists, the controllers keep us dialed into one point.
[48:03.360 --> 48:09.360]  How do you see their neural-order plan, their goals to build this extermination grid,
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.360]  this planetary government, and carry out the population reduction?
[48:13.360 --> 48:15.360]  To me, it looks like things aren't going well for them.
[48:15.360 --> 48:17.360]  And we're having victory after victory.
[48:17.360 --> 48:19.360]  And that there's an awakening accelerating.
[48:19.360 --> 48:25.360]  Do you think I'm too close to the fact that we are going to win in the end?
[48:25.360 --> 48:28.360]  And that I have a lot of faith because I'm deeper into this?
[48:28.360 --> 48:33.360]  And is that distorting my vision in your opinion that so many others aren't awake yet
[48:33.360 --> 48:36.360]  or are going deeper into the control?
[48:36.360 --> 48:38.360]  I mean, do you get the point I'm making?
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.360]  I've never doubted that it would turn out fine in the end.
[48:42.360 --> 48:48.360]  But the nature of the manipulation and the programming means that a lot of people
[48:48.360 --> 48:52.360]  have got to go a long way down the road before they actually see it.
[48:52.360 --> 48:58.360]  And it's a case of how deeply programmed you are before you actually see it
[48:58.360 --> 49:00.360]  and start to realize what's happening.
[49:00.360 --> 49:05.360]  And what I've seen over the last 20 years is an exponential curve
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.360]  without any question of people that were starting to get it.
[49:09.360 --> 49:11.360]  They're starting to get it in bigger and bigger and bigger numbers.
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.360]  And what I find interesting is they're starting to get it at higher levels immediately
[49:15.360 --> 49:21.360]  from being in the program to seeing well outside of the program.
[49:21.360 --> 49:23.360]  It's taking very little time for some people now.
[49:23.360 --> 49:25.360]  There is something going on.
[49:25.360 --> 49:31.360]  The first book I ever wrote on these subjects was nearly 20 years ago called Truth Vibrations.
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.360]  And it was named Truth Vibrations because it was based on the fact
[49:36.360 --> 49:41.360]  that I was understanding at the time that there was a vibrational change coming
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.360]  that was going to act like an alarm clock.
[49:43.360 --> 49:45.360]  It was going to wake them up.
[49:45.360 --> 49:48.360]  It was going to tease open their minds so consciousness could enter.
[49:48.360 --> 49:52.360]  And at the time, of course, I'm thinking, well, there's no evidence of this whatsoever.
[49:52.360 --> 49:54.360]  And it wasn't for a few years.
[49:54.360 --> 49:59.360]  But with the turn into the 21st century, I'm seeing it happening more and more and more.
[49:59.360 --> 50:01.360]  And it needs to happen.
[50:01.360 --> 50:04.360]  This is the way we're going to turn this around.
[50:04.360 --> 50:11.360]  But they're going to push it, obviously, as much as they can, to get their structure in place.
[50:11.360 --> 50:18.360]  But I do sense a feeling of increasing panic because every day they take to do it,
[50:18.360 --> 50:20.360]  more and more people are waking up.
[50:20.360 --> 50:21.360]  And I'm very optimistic.
[50:21.360 --> 50:26.360]  And although there's not going to be some enormous, real big challenges to come,
[50:26.360 --> 50:30.360]  but I'm getting more and more optimistic.
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.360]  And it's a phrase I use from time to time.
[50:35.360 --> 50:41.360]  Life tends to give us our greatest gifts, brilliantly disguised as our worst nightmares.
[50:41.360 --> 50:46.360]  Sometimes what appears to be our worst nightmare turns out to be our greatest gift,
[50:46.360 --> 50:51.360]  like massive ridicule for me in the early 1990s, right up to almost the year 2000.
[50:51.360 --> 50:53.360]  I went through incredible ridicule in Britain.
[50:53.360 --> 50:57.360]  But it set me free because it set me free of concern about what people thought of me,
[50:57.360 --> 51:01.360]  which allowed me to open my mind and allow consciousness in.
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.360]  And some of these challenges, which we don't like, I mean, who does,
[51:05.360 --> 51:10.360]  are actually going to awake a lot of people up and set them free.
[51:10.360 --> 51:14.360]  There's a line in a song which goes,
[51:14.360 --> 51:17.360]  Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.
[51:17.360 --> 51:20.360]  And you know, when we think we've got something to lose,
[51:20.360 --> 51:24.360]  that reptilian brain survival mechanism is controlling us.
[51:24.360 --> 51:27.360]  Oh my goodness, yes, anything, I don't want to lose this, anything.
[51:27.360 --> 51:31.360]  But when you lose it, then you go, well, hold on a second, what have I actually lost?
[51:31.360 --> 51:33.360]  This is okay, I can deal with this.
[51:33.360 --> 51:35.360]  And actually life's nicer.
[51:35.360 --> 51:39.360]  And it's funny that people, I talked to so many people who lived through the Second World War
[51:39.360 --> 51:42.360]  in Britain who say life was much nicer during the war,
[51:42.360 --> 51:45.360]  because people were nicer to each other and all the rest of it.
[51:45.360 --> 51:49.360]  They never had much, and they were helping each other because they never had much,
[51:49.360 --> 51:52.360]  and as soon as the war was over, every man for himself, all that stopped,
[51:52.360 --> 51:55.360]  and my goodness me, as it stopped now.
[51:55.360 --> 51:59.360]  And it also made them enjoy things more because they had less...
[51:59.360 --> 52:01.360]  They smelled the roses, they smelled the roses,
[52:01.360 --> 52:05.360]  because they thought they didn't know how long the roses were going to be there to be smelled.
[52:05.360 --> 52:08.360]  And you know, there's so many challenges, Alex,
[52:08.360 --> 52:11.360]  and I've had some big ones in my life, we all have.
[52:11.360 --> 52:14.360]  When I look back, I think I didn't like it at the time,
[52:14.360 --> 52:17.360]  but I wouldn't change a thing, because I am what I am,
[52:17.360 --> 52:20.360]  and I don't fight that, but to a large extent because of it.
[52:20.360 --> 52:22.360]  Well, there's that job.
[52:22.360 --> 52:26.360]  If we see that, if we experience these challenges from that perspective,
[52:26.360 --> 52:29.360]  rather than, oh my God, reptilian brain,
[52:29.360 --> 52:33.360]  then not only are we going to get through them with less pain and all the rest of it,
[52:33.360 --> 52:38.360]  we're actually going to think straight in a way that's going to allow us to get through them in a much more effective way.
[52:38.360 --> 52:41.360]  Absolutely, and the point I was going to add is that
[52:41.360 --> 52:44.360]  so many people in these pyramidal power structures,
[52:44.360 --> 52:49.360]  they are just as imprisoned as lowly little minions of the system,
[52:49.360 --> 52:53.360]  and more and more I'm talking to people to think of themselves as the elite,
[52:53.360 --> 52:56.360]  and they're beginning to realize this is a prison.
[52:56.360 --> 52:59.360]  They're beginning to realize they're drinking sodium fluoride.
[52:59.360 --> 53:00.360]  Their kids are drinking it.
[53:00.360 --> 53:05.360]  They're beginning to realize that this system affects everybody,
[53:05.360 --> 53:11.360]  and they're beginning to realize that the television and the culture and the dumbing down is taking their children from them
[53:11.360 --> 53:14.360]  and destroying their own destiny.
[53:14.360 --> 53:20.360]  So I'd like you to speak to that, and then I want to bring up Rolling Stone magazine
[53:20.360 --> 53:26.360]  that I just happened to see laying there on the commons table at the Emmys Building
[53:26.360 --> 53:28.360]  where I was doing the Sunday radio show, syndicated show.
[53:28.360 --> 53:31.360]  I want to break this down what Ray Kurzweil is saying,
[53:31.360 --> 53:33.360]  and we've got our vision of the future,
[53:33.360 --> 53:36.360]  liberty, freedom, you know, dynamic human spirit,
[53:36.360 --> 53:40.360]  a new renaissance to the power of a trillion,
[53:40.360 --> 53:47.360]  versus their renaissance, a very dark renaissance in their own words,
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.360]  they just say that it's beautiful, but clearly it's quite ugly.
[53:51.360 --> 53:54.360]  But I mean, can you speak to the point I just made?
[53:54.360 --> 53:58.360]  Yeah, this is a point I make as often as I can,
[53:58.360 --> 54:05.360]  because we go back to the sheep policing, the herd, the sheep policing themselves,
[54:05.360 --> 54:11.360]  because when you're talking about people in full awareness of this agenda
[54:11.360 --> 54:14.360]  and in full support of advancing it,
[54:14.360 --> 54:19.360]  you're talking about a dramatically few people compared with the global population.
[54:19.360 --> 54:25.360]  You're certainly not looking at enough to administer the institutions of control
[54:25.360 --> 54:28.360]  that we see across global society,
[54:28.360 --> 54:35.360]  so you need people in your target population to do the administration for you.
[54:35.360 --> 54:41.360]  This is why when you look at the pyramid structure of these organizations
[54:41.360 --> 54:44.360]  and these secret societies, whatever,
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.360]  you're looking at the few at the top in full awareness of what it's all about,
[54:48.360 --> 54:50.360]  and as you go further, further down the pyramid,
[54:50.360 --> 54:54.360]  each step down knows less and less and less and less about the big picture,
[54:54.360 --> 54:55.360]  only their part in it.
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.360]  And so they've got right across the system people in dark suits
[54:59.360 --> 55:03.360]  and they're like who are administering this system
[55:03.360 --> 55:10.360]  and are welded to it in terms of their subordination to it,
[55:10.360 --> 55:15.360]  or don't rock the boat, or don't step out of line, don't say anything.
[55:15.360 --> 55:19.360]  They get to dominate those under them and they get dominated from those above them.
[55:19.360 --> 55:20.360]  It's a psycho system.
[55:20.360 --> 55:21.360]  Yes, it is.
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.360]  And what we need to do, this is a very important area,
[55:25.360 --> 55:30.360]  is to get those people to actually, again, look around them,
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.360]  take a deep breath and just look at it again.
[55:33.360 --> 55:39.360]  And by connecting dots, you can let people who are in those systems
[55:39.360 --> 55:43.360]  realize how their dot connects with everyone else's,
[55:43.360 --> 55:46.360]  because stopping them realizing that is how the whole system works,
[55:46.360 --> 55:50.360]  so people make their daily contribution to a control system,
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.360]  not realizing that their dot is adding to other dots to make the control system.
[55:54.360 --> 55:58.360]  And it's so important that those people understand,
[55:58.360 --> 56:02.360]  whether they're in uniform or whether they're in dark suit professions,
[56:02.360 --> 56:06.360]  that their children are going to have to live in the world
[56:06.360 --> 56:10.360]  that they are helping fundamentally to introduce.
[56:10.360 --> 56:15.360]  You know, all these legislation that is even written and administered
[56:15.360 --> 56:18.360]  around the world to build this police state
[56:18.360 --> 56:23.360]  is done by people who are themselves and their children and grandchildren
[56:23.360 --> 56:28.360]  are going to be subjected to that police state that they're helping to build.
[56:28.360 --> 56:29.360]  And talk about a fraud.
[56:29.360 --> 56:31.360]  They're going to build their own families, you know,
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.360]  and they need to start stepping out of that pyramid,
[56:34.360 --> 56:39.360]  because when they do, and refusing to play a part in it,
[56:39.360 --> 56:41.360]  because when they do, the pyramid collapses,
[56:41.360 --> 56:42.360]  because they're holding it up.
[56:42.360 --> 56:44.360]  Let me throw a point in here, David.
[56:44.360 --> 56:45.360]  Exactly.
[56:45.360 --> 56:46.360]  Let me throw a point in.
[56:46.360 --> 56:49.360]  I mean, to talk about how it's all a facade and all a matrix illusion,
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.360]  look at the world banking system out of fiat currency
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.360]  with a handful of less than 15 families who rule the planet,
[56:56.360 --> 57:02.360]  because they bought off governments to say that they issued the backing of the money.
[57:02.360 --> 57:04.360]  I mean, it's all just a fraud.
[57:04.360 --> 57:07.360]  And then out of that, what they're doing right now, economically,
[57:07.360 --> 57:11.360]  trying to bankrupt things, so we have to depend on the state
[57:11.360 --> 57:15.360]  and have to be under their control looks like a desperate gamble.
[57:15.360 --> 57:17.360]  Yeah, we have to say, we have to say,
[57:17.360 --> 57:19.360]  no, we're not building our own prison anymore,
[57:19.360 --> 57:21.360]  and then something fantastic happens.
[57:21.360 --> 57:23.360]  We stop building our own prison,
[57:23.360 --> 57:25.360]  and the next thing is the prison isn't being built,
[57:25.360 --> 57:26.360]  and there is no prison.
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.360]  Look how many people work for the banking system
[57:29.360 --> 57:31.360]  and administer it and make it happen,
[57:31.360 --> 57:33.360]  compared with the number of people that own it.
[57:33.360 --> 57:35.360]  It's fantastic.
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.360]  David Eich, let's come back, talk about solutions,
[57:38.360 --> 57:40.360]  and at the bottom of the hour, start taking phone calls.
[57:40.360 --> 57:43.360]  I'm also going to get into this.
[57:43.360 --> 57:46.360]  They say the elite are going to live forever in Rolling Stone.
[57:46.360 --> 57:48.360]  Oh, I thought I heard that in endgame.
[57:48.360 --> 58:14.360]  We'll break it down.
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.360]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food
[58:18.360 --> 58:20.360]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration,
[58:20.360 --> 58:23.360]  or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost

[59:26.360 --> 59:29.360]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis,
[59:29.360 --> 59:32.360]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.

[1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:51.360]  I can literally taste it as my teeth clench and lock together.
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:57.360]  I can feel my ancestors' victories against tyranny
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:04.360]  and the great battles they fought, the struggles of the species,
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.360]  everything it is to the human.
[1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:13.360]  I can feel it coursing through my very bones,
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:19.360]  my heart, my guts, the sinews in my forearms,
[1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:28.360]  my fists that are cracked in our fritic burn with power.
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:33.360]  All of you have that same human spark.
[1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:39.360]  Destiny is to build. Your destiny is to create.
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:46.360]  Your destiny is to be free, free of bondage,
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:50.360]  free of lesser men's control.
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:53.360]  And I want you to stand up.
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:55.360]  And I want you to get focused.
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:02:02.360]  And I want you to stop being afraid of turning your own personal destiny
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:06.360]  and the power that God has put in each of us.
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:14.360]  We are literally made in the image of the creator of the universe.
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:17.360]  You realize that's why the New World Order hates you.
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:20.360]  That's why the devil hates you.
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:23.360]  And that's why they're so afraid of us.
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:30.360]  We are literally not even at embryonic form of what humanity is going to become.
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:35.360]  We have not even become larvae yet, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:41.360]  And every ounce of my being only wants to see the species do well
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:47.360]  and to grow and to turn into what we are to become.
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:54.360]  All of our trials, all of our tribulations, everything we are.
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:58.360]  And you look at who our heroes are today, basketball players, football players,
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:02.360]  nothing good that will mean even less tomorrow or next year.
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:06.360]  No longer is it the people that stand up against tyranny of the heroes.
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:10.360]  No longer is it the people that save burning children from a building.
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:15.360]  No longer is it individuals who invent incredible new technologies.
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:17.360]  No longer.
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:20.360]  They know how to take your heroes and give you false heroes.
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.360]  They know how to punch your buttons and manipulate you.
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:27.360]  And it's time that you literally break out of that cage.
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:31.360]  It's time for you to bust out and break out like the Incredible Hulk.
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:33.360]  It's time to get wild.
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:37.360]  There's nothing that can stop us if we just turn it all loose.
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:57.360]  I can feel the freedom.
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:00.360]  You can break through the New World Order right now.
[1:04:00.360 --> 1:04:11.360]  You can stop being a slave right now.
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:18.360]  It's just a kiss away.
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:21.360]  All these people that hate beauty.
[1:04:21.360 --> 1:04:23.360]  All these people that hate strength.
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:29.360]  All these people that want to turn you into a pile of stupid, dull-eyed weakness.
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:31.360]  They make me sick.
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:05:00.360]  Everything in me wants life in green fields and happiness running over.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:06.360]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.
[1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:08.360]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:12.360]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[1:05:12.360 --> 1:05:14.360]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[1:05:14.360 --> 1:05:21.360]  And now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:24.360]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:26.360]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:30.360]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price and their formula really works.
[1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:33.360]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:35.360]  Try the Nutra Cafe.
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:39.360]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:42.360]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:43.360]  And take it from me, folks.
[1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:44.360]  It really does taste great.
[1:05:44.360 --> 1:05:46.360]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:52.360]  Go to www.enerfod.com.
[1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:57.360]  That's www.enerfod.com.

[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:27.360]  We've got a disgusting local newscast I want to break down and analyze.
[1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:31.360]  Coming up later as well in the next hour.
[1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:35.360]  I do want to go ahead and just fire out the toll free phone number.
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:40.360]  Because I'm going to start taking calls at the beginning of the next hour and covering a blitzkrieg of news.
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:42.360]  And boy is it all important.
[1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:50.360]  1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231.
[1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:54.360]  But as they say, once more into the breach.
[1:06:54.360 --> 1:07:00.360]  And so into the valley of death, road 600.
[1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:04.360]  Forget who said that on a part of its Shakespeare.
[1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:11.360]  You know, constantly at night and in the morning I write notes about thoughts and points I want to make.
[1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:13.360]  And it needs to be done.
[1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:15.360]  You can talk about some of these issues.
[1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:17.360]  Larger issues.
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:22.360]  Overall philosophy issues.
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:29.360]  But I assure you, new listeners, if you will simply follow your instincts.
[1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:31.360]  Because I know what your gut's telling you right now.
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:33.360]  It's telling you I'm telling you the truth.
[1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:35.360]  Because I do tell the truth.
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:38.360]  And I do my research.
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:40.360]  Does that mean I always get it right?
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:42.360]  No.
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:44.360]  But I try to get it right.
[1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:50.360]  And we're frighteningly accurate here. I'd say 95% plus.
[1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:53.360]  I was about to say 98, but it sounds obnoxious.
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.360]  It's above 95% accuracy.
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:04.360]  Most of our inaccuracy is underestimating evil.
[1:08:04.360 --> 1:08:15.360]  It's hard for me to imagine that there are hundreds of thousands of people conservatively sociologists and psychologists and criminologists predict,
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:20.360]  bare minimum, in the world, hundreds of thousands, probably more,
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:28.360]  that enjoy kidnapping little children and torturing them to death for weeks and then killing them.
[1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:43.360]  That is hard for me to imagine that there are people who enjoy torturing innocent people to death.
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:51.360]  But just because that is 180 degrees alien from what most of us believe in,
[1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:57.360]  in what most of us love, in what most of us like, in what most of our tastes are,
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:07.360]  nevertheless, those individuals are amongst us.
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.360]  And there's different debates on it, different psychological reports that have been done on it,
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:15.360]  some quackery, some quite accurate.
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:23.360]  Some estimates have as many as two psychopaths for every hundred people.
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:29.360]  Most of the studies show, on average, about one psychopath per every hundred people.
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:34.360]  And I guess how many sociopaths there are for every hundred.
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:41.360]  Some gauges have 20% being sociopaths.
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:44.360]  That is, they don't enjoy killing you, they just don't care if you die.
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:59.360]  See, a psychopath enjoys it and enjoys the power trip of it.
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:05.360]  And so what you have is psychopaths, high functioning psychopaths,
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:11.360]  in command of legions of sociopaths.
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:19.360]  The psychopaths also command legions of people that like to be enslaved
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:21.360]  and people that like to serve psychopaths.
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:24.360]  Well, whip me, beat me, types.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:34.360]  Like many of their most dangerous operatives are the chicken neck ghoul variety that I so love.
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:41.360]  And then, of course, they have the sadistic sadist, they have armies of them,
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:55.360]  and they operate, the virus of tyranny operates best in a fat and decadent, spoiled environment.
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:00.360]  And boy, in America, the epitome of that, fat, dumb, and happy.
[1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:07.360]  It's like rotten, stagnant water that you've pumped a thousand gallons of fresh sewage into.
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:16.360]  Oh, it's already full of bacteria and filth, but it's going to become pure cess sludge.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:23.360]  Pure detritus, liquid E. coli, liquid death.
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:31.360]  Only the New World Order would come up with an artificial sweetener that rots holes in your brains,
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:37.360]  kills your cells in match, attacks every organ, attacks your pancreas,
[1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:44.360]  and is the defecation of genetically engineered E. coli bacteria.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:47.360]  Only the New World Order would come up with that.
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:53.360]  And everything they do is a wicked invention. They are creators.
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:12:03.360]  They mimic God. They counterfeit God, but in a twisted, stinking way.
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:10.360]  What they do, they are creators.
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:16.360]  Made in the image of the creator of the universe, but twisted and dark with a dark logic,
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:22.360]  a different science, a different language of mathematics.
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:35.360]  They come from the gulfs, the black gulfs of pain and suffering.
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:45.360]  They hate the light, so they seek to tear it down, to topple it, to overturn it.
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  Psychopaths, and I've interviewed some of the top psychiatrists that have interviewed
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:52.360]  some of the most famous psychopaths here on here.
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:56.360]  In fact, I forget that lady's name. We need to get her back on and we'll interview all the psychos.
[1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:59.360]  And her on years ago was amazing.
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:03.360]  We've got to create a list of all these powerful guests, and then we have them on once and we have them on again.
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:13.360]  And she was describing what the best cinema description of it would be the remake
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:17.360]  of the Manchurian candidate, that whenever he goes under mind control,
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:21.360]  everything kind of glows, everything's like brilliant, he feels totally alive.
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:26.360]  Whenever they give him the program words, everything blazes.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:33.360]  And a psychopath is depressed and unhappy and upset, generally,
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:41.360]  and only feels alive when they've got a child chained down, burning them with cigarettes and electrical wires,
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:44.360]  and torturing them and begging and hearing them sob for their mother.
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:48.360]  It's like blazing, burning light. It's like a life. Oh, it's beautiful.
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:52.360]  While they're killing the goodness and the innocence.
[1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:56.360]  So you want to know why Bill Gates is so happy?
[1:13:56.360 --> 1:14:02.360]  He's one of the biggest eugenicists in history, folks.
[1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:06.360]  I think it's a fair estimate to say he is tens of billions worldwide for eugenics.
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:10.360]  He's probably got more megadethes under his belt than Adolf Alois Hitler.
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:15.360]  I don't think he has Mao championed yet, but he'll get there.
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:20.360]  He's as happy as a pig, and you know what?
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:23.360]  And he likes it.
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:27.360]  And he's organized, and he's focused, and he's professional, and he's laughing at you,
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:31.360]  and he understands sociology and psychology, and he enjoys it.
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:34.360]  He enjoys walking through an airport and just looking at everybody.
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:38.360]  He's running black ops on. It's a little special secret to him.
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:48.360]  He is, to the power of infinity, the archetype of the punk busboy who puts a booger in somebody's
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:56.360]  Fettuccine Alfredo, and I've seen a busboy do that.
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:15:01.360]  I saw him in a little dark hallway from my table looking back where the plates were being put up,
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:03.360]  steaming for the people.
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:07.360]  Maybe somebody had given him a weird look because he was so insecure and neurotic
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:12.360]  just a biological android, a suboyed demon.
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:17.360]  And he had that power to stick his finger in his nose and to stick that booger right in that food.
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:26.360]  And that's what Bill Gates is, but a giant, powerful, spoiled, wicked little busboy.
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:28.360]  And he's going to stick sodium fluoride in your water.
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:32.360]  He's going to give you special shots that are going to make you feel real good
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:37.360]  because he is a smiley-faced demon-eyed right out of the pit of hell,
[1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:41.360]  and I swear eternal resistance to you.
[1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:48.360]  And I spend my life, and I spend my fortune, and I spend my soul and my energy
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:16:01.360]  ramming straight into you with everything I got.
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:07.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:11.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:17.360]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:22.360]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:26.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:29.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:32.360]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:36.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:41.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:45.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:47.360]  a long-time sponsor of ours.
[1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:51.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:03.360]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:05.360]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:06.360]  Well, you should.
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:10.360]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:11.360]  That's right.
[1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:17.360]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:21.360]  and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[1:17:21.360 --> 1:17:26.360]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XV pistol
[1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:28.360]  in the caliber of your choice.
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:32.360]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:35.360]  to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:39.360]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:41.360]  or drill instructor attitudes.
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:42.360]  This is real.
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:43.360]  Don't miss out.
[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:46.360]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course,
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:50.360]  plus a 30-state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:52.360]  And get your free handgun.

[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:34.360]  Go to FrontSight.com for your training and free gun.
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:39.360]  So from the day you were born, from the time you were formed in your mother's womb,
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:47.360]  the creator of the universe and all the dimensions and all that is and will ever be,
[1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:52.360]  the I am that I am has a mission for you.
[1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:55.360]  But you were given free will.
[1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:59.360]  And so you have to take that mission up in your hands.
[1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:04.360]  You have to face the fear of the great dog that roars on the field
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:07.360]  in an attempt to stifle your will.
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:09.360]  You have to stand against the new world order.
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:11.360]  You have to resist it.
[1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:16.360]  You have to go through the fire and commit even unto death,
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:24.360]  even unto imprisonment to sacrifice yourself in this holy cause of liberty and freedom.
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:28.360]  You must pledge yourself on the altar of freedom.
[1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:36.360]  You must commit your entire being and pledge eternal resistance to charity.
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:45.360]  Only now at this point will you be ready to take up your destiny.
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:51.360]  Now he sees a whole being as it lies to see.
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:55.360]  The issue to men out there is
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:03.360]  that some of the more dominant Greek city states were tired of the city states
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.360]  killing each other and they decided to focus their activities outward.
[1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:13.360]  And it's at that time that the state inculcated sports into daily life
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:17.360]  so that the men wouldn't kill each other.
[1:24:17.360 --> 1:24:21.360]  Because it's not some child chained down to a bed having their teeth pulled out.
[1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:28.360]  It is a vicious man rippling with muscles in focus who is going to kill you.
[1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:30.360]  And it is real.
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:34.360]  And it is an animating contest of liberty.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:37.360]  Who will survive?
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:42.360]  And so that's why you go paint yourself up in war paint and yell and scream in a football game.
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:46.360]  And it's not even bad enough itself except that you're not in the arena.
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  You are now learning to live through other men and through other women
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:52.360]  instead of being in the arena yourself.
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.360]  And let me tell you what those instincts for war and strength
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  and what those instincts to get up in front of a crowd are for.
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.360]  It is for leadership to defend the women and children.
[1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:08.360]  But as societies got larger and became agrarian and as city states were developed
[1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:13.360]  then it was more sophisticated and more mechanized to have war with your neighbor
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:16.360]  and survive and it became a science.
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:22.360]  And then the science of war became light years more sophisticated than it was thousands of years ago.
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:27.360]  Toward now the directed energies of the system of the overclass
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:33.360]  using the entire scientific funding mechanisms of the nation states
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:37.360]  to form a world government that then destroys the nation states
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:41.360]  and brings in a planetary regime of oppression and control
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:43.360]  and sterilization and micro management.
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:49.360]  A hellish global regime where everything you do and say and speak and own is chronicled
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.360]  where societies are squeezed and trampled and herded into control grids
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:56.360]  into culling pins.
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:01.360]  And everything I've told you over these years has now been said by Pelosi
[1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:06.360]  and said by Holdren the czar over science.
[1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:12.360]  These bastards publish full length textbooks detailing the grizzly operation.
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:15.360]  Everything I've said has been validated.
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:20.360]  Now four books he's contributed to or that he wrote in total have now emerged.
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:25.360]  In total 3,000 nightmare pages plus that must be read.
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:29.360]  Each new page a grizzly horror show.
[1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:35.360]  You know why? Because this isn't some nut, some recluse in a backwoods cabin saying this.
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:40.360]  This is the elite he has been chosen because his textbook
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:45.360]  and I've now read over 400 pages of it has been adopted.
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:47.360]  He is honored.
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:50.360]  They all compete with different plans that are very similar
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:53.360]  and to fine tune the current eugenics operations
[1:26:53.360 --> 1:26:59.360]  and his plan along with Ehrlich has been adopted.
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:03.360]  And so when you see headlines like Bill Gates wants to control the weather
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:06.360]  to save the earth from global warming.
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.360]  See everything's going to be converted to this fake survival mechanism.
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:12.360]  This is all your design and built around defense.
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:15.360]  So they create fake wars that are actually meant to destroy you.
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  They create the fake terrorist or they fund real terrorists.
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:21.360]  They create the fake environmental movement to tax carbon
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.360]  that is part of the entire life cycle in all industry and all life.
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:26.360]  Won't you exhale two and a half pounds of a day?
[1:27:26.360 --> 1:27:31.360]  They create a fake climate system where they then use the very climate machines
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:36.360]  they've created to hurt the environment, create droughts, create floods and freak weather
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:41.360]  and you fund them to publicly fight what they've created.
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  We'll come back, finish up with this and go through a lot more on the other side.
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:17.360]  You know how you lied to me, you're not the way you seem.
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:28.360]  You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel.
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:35.360]  But I got wise, you're the devil in disguise.
[1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  Not you getting suckered, not you clinging to the terror.
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:48.360]  I thought that I was in heaven but I was sure surprised.
[1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:56.360]  Heaven held me, I didn't see the devil in your eyes.
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:02.360]  You look like an angel, walk like an angel.
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:05.360]  This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:08.360]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:11.360]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:16.360]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:19.360]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive,
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:22.360]  immune and developmental system diseases.
[1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:24.360]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:28.360]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:30.360]  of you and your family's drinking water.

[1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:32.360]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:35.360]  to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:39.360]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:41.360]  or drill instructor attitudes.

[1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:07.360]  buying a solar power generator this summer.
[1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:11.360]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:11.360 --> 1:31:13.360]  Number two, our new energies are,
[1:31:13.360 --> 1:31:17.360]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:22.360]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:24.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country,
[1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:26.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:28.360]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:32.360]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:36.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:40.360]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:40.360 --> 1:31:44.360]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:44.360 --> 1:31:46.360]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:51.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:53.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:03.360]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:06.360]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient,
[1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:08.360]  and today that's more important than ever.
[1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:11.360]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:14.360]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line or you have your own bread.
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:18.360]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:20.360]  in any emergency if you're simply prepared.
[1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:23.360]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:26.360]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food
[1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:30.360]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:33.360]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:38.360]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:45.360]  freeze dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[1:32:48.360 --> 1:32:51.360]  or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:56.360]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:32:56.360 --> 1:33:13.360]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[1:33:13.360 --> 1:33:17.360]  He's got a new documentary out.
[1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:22.360]  Global warming, emerging science, and understanding.
[1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:27.360]  We also have another film we carry, Global Warming or Global Government.
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:29.360]  You need to show these to your friends and family and neighbors.
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:34.360]  First they get you all hyped up that humans are bad, it's for the earth, we're going to save it.
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:38.360]  This is social workers, bureaucracy, feudalism, serfdom.
[1:33:38.360 --> 1:33:45.360]  They want to go to a post-industrial system of total bondage and slavery under environmental crimes.
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:47.360]  And it's not toxic waste dumping they're worried about,
[1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:53.360]  or open-air planning of cross-PCs, genetic engineered organisms that could cause a problem.
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:57.360]  It's not about real environmentalism or conservation, it's about control.
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:03.360]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, so much has happened since we had you on six months ago, time just flies.
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:05.360]  They've passed the total carbon tax takeover.
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:09.360]  It was worse than we feared, they kept the bill secret, the latter passed.
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:15.360]  Total federalization, home inspections, shutting down selectively, whatever they want.
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:22.360]  Every federal agency and sub-agencies with the power to levy carbon taxes arbitrarily.
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:26.360]  It seems the new direction in government is just to give dictatorial power to the agency.
[1:34:26.360 --> 1:34:32.360]  They've got gun bills introduced to let the Attorney General ban any guns he wants at his stroke of a pen,
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:37.360]  if he just states it, that allow him to put anybody on a no fly list or no gun by list,
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:39.360]  no judge, no jury, no conviction.
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:41.360]  It's the same thing with this global carbon system.
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:45.360]  They just set up offshore authorities and then we're ruled by them.
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:46.360]  Dr. Kaufman.
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:52.360]  Absolutely, because we have no way of actually addressing somebody that's offshore
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:55.360]  that does not have any accountability to us whatsoever.
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:35:00.360]  And that's why they're doing it, because they want to basically control the U.S. economy.
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:02.360]  And remember, we've talked about this on your program before,
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:09.360]  for every bit of carbon dioxide that's emitted, it has a corresponding impact on our economy.
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:11.360]  It's almost a one-to-one ratio.
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:19.360]  So if we reduce our carbon emissions by 20%, we reduce our economy about by 20%.
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:21.360]  It's a terrible, terrible thing.
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:24.360]  They're trying to get renewable energy to take its place,
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:31.360]  but Spain has shown that for every green job created with renewable energy, they lose two and a half jobs.
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:35.360]  It cost hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in Spain.
[1:35:35.360 --> 1:35:36.360]  They have 18% unemployment.
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.360]  They've been doing this for 10 years.
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:44.360]  But see the government then directs the switchover in the economy,
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  and the profits only go to a select few, so it vertically integrates.
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:50.360]  But they know carbon's not bad, Dr. Kaufman.
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:52.360]  They know it's what plants breathe.
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  That's why they diabolically chose carbon to tax,
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:00.360]  knowing it's a carbon cycle and we're carbon-based life forms.
[1:36:00.360 --> 1:36:01.360]  Absolutely.
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:04.360]  And this new DVD that you mentioned, Global Warming and Emergency Science,
[1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:10.360]  has new footage in it from the old DVD that clearly and positively shows
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.360]  that man cannot be causing global warming.
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:19.360]  In fact, a new study was just released yesterday that basically says that all of the carbon dioxide
[1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:24.360]  in the last 600,000 years couldn't be responsible for the warming and the cooling.
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:26.360]  There is no correlation whatsoever.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:28.360]  It calls in this serious doubt.
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.360]  This is peer-reviewed in Nature Science.
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:35.360]  It's peer-reviewed science that shows that there is strong evidence of questions now
[1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.360]  of the man-caused global warming theory based on carbon dioxide.
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:45.360]  So everything is against these people, yet you see in Congress them major, major push
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:46.360]  how they got it.
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.360]  They introduced the bill on May 15th.
[1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:51.360]  It was passed on June 26th.
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:54.360]  Over 1,000, almost 1,500 pages long.
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.360]  Nobody had a chance to read it.
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:37:00.360]  It's the most expensive bill this country has ever passed.
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:06.360]  It was rammed through Congress, and what it contains will blow your mind.
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:12.360]  Basically, everything that you said in introducing this whole subject is true, plus a lot.
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:15.360]  I mean, you're only touching the surface areas.
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  It will destroy this nation as we know it now.
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:23.360]  But that's exactly what the Club of Rome, that's exactly what Holdren called for.
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:27.360]  Let's first get into academia.
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.360]  I mean, you have worked around these phony environmentalists.
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:31.360]  You've been around them.
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:37.360]  In my experience, the majority, the vast majority of them do believe in neo-eugenics.
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:39.360]  They do believe in sterilization.
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:41.360]  They do believe in one-child policies.
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:44.360]  And now they're openly pushing it, saying babies are bad.
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:46.360]  They have a bad carbon footprint.
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  I'm going to show some headlines to people here in a moment.
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:54.360]  And really, these are just control freaks who want a managed, collectivist economy.
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:56.360]  And they're making their move right now.
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:02.360]  And now we have the President's Technology Advisors textbook, 1100 pages saying,
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:04.360]  Forcibly drug the water.
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:06.360]  Have CPS take all the children.
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:08.360]  We wonder why the government seems so out of control.
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.360]  And nuts, they're not nuts.
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:12.360]  They know what they're doing.
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:13.360]  Well, they're nuts.
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  They're absolutely insane.
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:15.360]  There's no question about that.
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:17.360]  But they are doing it deliberately, yes.
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:20.360]  There's no question about it for exactly the reasons you're discussing.
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  In fact, I am literally astonished that anybody in their right mind
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:28.360]  would even consider doing what is being done right now
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:33.360]  because there is no justification for whatsoever other than the political justification
[1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  of destroying us and rebuilding it in their image under their control.
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:39.360]  No, they're communist.
[1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:40.360]  They're communist.
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:42.360]  I mean, they are scum.
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:45.360]  I'm sorry to interrupt, but yes, destroying is rebuilding us in their image.
[1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:47.360]  It's really happening.
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:49.360]  They're taking over health care, industries.
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:51.360]  They're seizing everything.
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:53.360]  I mean, they are going to destroy the economy.
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:56.360]  And the only jobs you're going to get is from them on welfare
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:58.360]  or through a government contract.
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, I wanted to continue to talk about the film Global Warming,
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:05.360]  Emerging Science and Understanding here in this final segment.
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:10.360]  We're carrying this and your other documentary on global warming or global governance.
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  Everyone needs to see this just because our listeners may know all about this.
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:22.360]  Their friends, their family, other school teachers, people don't know.
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:25.360]  And so we need to reach out and educate the public.
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:29.360]  Even if they pass these global carbon taxes, we've got to fight it and expose it
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  so we can repeal it.
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:31.360]  Dr. Kaufman.
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:32.360]  Absolutely.
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:33.360]  There is no question about that.
[1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:37.360]  And one of the reasons we did this second DVD was to bring new, brand new information
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:43.360]  into the debate, as well as format it in a way that you can give to your friends
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:46.360]  and neighbors in a very easy to understand format.
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:49.360]  You can give it to your sixth school science teachers.
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:55.360]  It's designed for school classrooms showing to combat Al Gore's inconvenient truth.
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:57.360]  It's designed to share with other people.
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  You can make copies of it to share, not to sell it,
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:03.360]  but to make copies to give to your friends and neighbors
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:07.360]  and to your school teachers and so forth to try to spread this word
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:11.360]  because once they see this and it's extremely well done, folks,
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  this is an order of magnitude better than my first documentary.
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:16.360]  And it is very conclusive.
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:20.360]  I have got nothing to rave reviews from a variety of sources,
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  including kids down to about 10 years old.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:27.360]  So it is really a dynamic video that just takes the starch right out of the need
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:29.360]  for even having cap and trade legislation.
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:30.360]  Absolutely.
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  Let me just ask you a side issue.
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  What feedback have you gotten now two years into Endgame being out?
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:41.360]  Because Endgame is, I think, my best film, my most important film.
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:45.360]  Obama Deception is my biggest film because it shatters the left-right paradigm
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:48.360]  and shows his real agenda and it covers some eugenics.
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:51.360]  But what feedback have you gotten being in Endgame?
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:57.360]  Very heavy feedback, Alex, from a lot of people calling to find out exactly
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:00.360]  because I'm only on there for maybe five minutes totally.
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:04.360]  Finding out my view on what the whole DVD is about.
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  And again, I'm not an expert on eugenics.
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:09.360]  So I have to say basically I know about as much as you do on that issue.
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  But nonetheless, people are very interested in it.
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:16.360]  When I say that it's actually worse than what you portrayed on that,
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  but we can't really say that is bad enough what we say on that DVD.
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:23.360]  We need to understand it and believe it.
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:25.360]  And people walk away with their head.
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:27.360]  I get interrupted on the streets.
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:30.360]  People who know me and have seen Endgame and so forth
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:33.360]  and ask me questions has been an extremely effective DVD.
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:37.360]  Well, we need to make your new film as prolific as Endgame,
[1:41:37.360 --> 1:41:39.360]  Global Warming, Emerging Science, and Understanding,
[1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:41.360]  available at infowars.com.
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139-888-2533139.
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:51.360]  Well, I'm going to be really hammering the eugenics issue,
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:56.360]  the global carbon tax issue as we try to defeat what's happening in the Senate.
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:42:01.360]  It looks like we may be able to stop it because they were able to hide the bill
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.360]  300 pages of it until it passed.
[1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  Now, though, it is public and I think it may get beaten,
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:08.360]  but they're not going to stop there.
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:10.360]  So we're definitely in a serious fight.
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  Yes, we definitely are.
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:15.360]  And we need to keep the fight up, not only with Global Warming.
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:17.360]  That's where I'm focusing right now, my efforts,
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:19.360]  because you're going to do one thing at a time.
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:23.360]  But this water issue is crisis, the health care issue is a crisis.
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:25.360]  All of these things, we need to be active
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.360]  and just calling your senators and congressmen and say,
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:29.360]  no, we're not going to vote for that.
[1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  If you do, I'm not going to, I'm going to do everything I can
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.360]  to see that you're not elected again.
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:37.360]  And I think I would really encourage some state
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  where they really have an ability to get in there
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.360]  and recall some of their senators and congressmen
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:46.360]  when they vote for these disagreements without even reading it.
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:47.360]  Well, I agree.
[1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  You know, that ties into the eugenics, the government-run health care.
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:52.360]  They want to carry their eugenics out against us.
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:55.360]  Looting forced abortions, as the White House Chief says,
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:58.360]  Science Chief, Dr. Kaufman, great having you with us.
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.360]  Thank you for having me back.
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:23.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:56.360]  Thank you.
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:03.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:55.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:45:22.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:55.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:25.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:53.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:46:53.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:49.360]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  So, when Anderson Cooper, who's admittedly CIA,
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  Oh, I was CIA, he said, but then I went and joined CNN.
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:02.360]  The heir to the aster fortune, a disgusting globalist, a piece of trash on record.
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:07.360]  When he does all these constant TV shows about cops in Texas robbing people,
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:11.360]  and there are some bad towns and counties that are doing this,
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:15.360]  instead of having a newscast about how the state government and the state police
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:20.360]  go after these people, CNN kind of halfway legitimizes it,
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  but then says the feds need to federalize.
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:26.360]  When you don't have Texas towns running giant white slavery rings,
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.360]  like Dincourt and Halliburton are.
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  See, you got the big federal international evil.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:35.360]  It loves to show you the little local corruption as a pretext to come in and take over.
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:38.360]  And they love to show the police beating people.
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:42.360]  They love to show out of control thug cops choking teenagers for no reason.
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:45.360]  It's wrong. It's wrong that they're doing that.
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  But the issue is, why are they showing it so much?
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.360]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, they want us at each other's throats.
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:56.360]  They are planning on instigating a revolution in this country
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:48:59.360]  that is going to slaughter the police and military,
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:02.360]  and then after everything breaks down, just like in Argentina and other countries,
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:03.360]  and I've had economists on from there.
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:07.360]  Same thing, local cops in military get shot up, the citizens get shot up,
[1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:11.360]  and then six months later, everybody's tired of rioting, and then the globalists come in.
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  I was talking to a friend of mine the other day, and he said,
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  have you seen the CIA declassified report?
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:17.360]  And I said, no, I Googled it.
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:20.360]  Another CIA training manual released from 63.
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  How to torture people, how to break them, how to control local populations.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:28.360]  And I sat there for two hours and read the whole document,
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:31.360]  and it was everything I'm already seeing the feds do.
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  I just wish we could end this nightmare and arrest all these bankers and eugenicists trash.
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  I'm sick of them, and I'm sick of how the whole thing's run by psychologists and psychiatrists
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  who know how to manipulate us, and they're playing games with us,
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:53.360]  and manipulating our society, and manipulating our social system,
[1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  and the way men operate, and the way women operate.
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:57.360]  They know how we operate.
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:01.360]  They know how we work, folks, and they're manipulating us,
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:05.360]  just like we're in a Petri dish, and they got a microscope studying us,
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:09.360]  and looking at us, and understanding how we operate.
[1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:11.360]  That's what they're doing.
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:15.360]  I just, when you know about this level of evil, you know about these criminals
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:18.360]  operating in plain view, you know they're poisoning the water,
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:21.360]  you know they're poisoning the food on record,
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:25.360]  it's just, you expect to see things instantly change.
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:27.360]  But that's not how things work.
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:29.360]  They didn't build their system overnight.
[1:50:29.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  We're not going to dismantle their system and get the Republic back overnight.
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  But number one, having the attitude to win, the attitude to take action,
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:41.360]  having the facts, getting involved, you will get better at what you're doing
[1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:44.360]  by stepping up, by taking action.
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  And so I can't expose all the eugenics.
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:49.360]  I mean, literally I have seven stacks in here, this tall, each one,
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  pure mainstream news, pushing eugenics, telling you how great it is to be sterilized.
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.360]  And I've covered probably 30 or 40 of those today.
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.360]  The point is, go look at it for yourself.
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:50:59.360]  It's a bottomless pit.
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:04.360]  They're committing crimes and evil and micromanaging control freak garbage so fast.
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:08.360]  I can't even track it.
[1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:12.360]  It's just a criminal society has taken over.
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:17.360]  They use scientific techniques and we're all in the same boat.
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:19.360]  They are screwing all of us.
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:24.360]  I don't care who you are or what you are or what color you are or where you live.
[1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:29.360]  But I know this, I'm getting letters from Brazil and letters from South Korea
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:32.360]  and letters from Japan and letters from Russia and calls from Russia.
[1:51:32.360 --> 1:51:36.360]  And I talked to contractors and I talked to workers and I talked to family
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:40.360]  who are on cruise ships in other parts of the world and who were at factories
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:44.360]  in other parts of the world and who and have people walk up to them and say,
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:45.360]  have you heard info wars.com?
[1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  Have you heard Alex Jones folks?
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:52.360]  The responsibility of the fact that I'm trying to play down the people we reach.
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:56.360]  But I know the establishment knows I'm reaching tens of millions now every month.
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:57.360]  New.
[1:51:57.360 --> 1:51:59.360]  I mean, we've hit mega viral level.
[1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:03.360]  My radio show and the films are just a tiny little node.
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:07.360]  It's like a virus, but a good virus that just you introduce a few viruses
[1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:09.360]  and then it turns into billions.
[1:52:09.360 --> 1:52:11.360]  I'm under total surveillance.
[1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:13.360]  I've got all sorts of black ops being pulled on me.
[1:52:13.360 --> 1:52:16.360]  I just ignore it and trust in God, you know, to go through the storm.
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:18.360]  I'm happy I've done this.
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  You're only alive once.
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:22.360]  But the issue is we're making history right now.
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:27.360]  And the establishment is launching all sorts of co until pro whisper campaigns,
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:28.360]  black ops attacks.
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:32.360]  They're pulling out all the stops on me trying to set me up.
[1:52:32.360 --> 1:52:35.360]  And I just want folks to know whatever happens to me.
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:36.360]  It's a victory.
[1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:41.360]  The testament to what I've been able to do with your help taking action.
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:46.360]  The testament, these type of stories that that that this writer,
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:51.360]  John and Tampa Bay tells me where all the cops he sees are awake.
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:59.360]  I mean, you know, it's just, I was talking to a friend last night who was in Oregon
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:01.360]  visiting family.
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:04.360]  I believe she told me the story, but she was visiting some friends in Florida.
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:07.360]  I mean, and I was thinking of Florida and let me go back to the exact story.
[1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:10.360]  Hold on, kind of download that here mentally.
[1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:11.360]  I was talking to a friend last night.
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  We were having dinner.
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:18.360]  I'm a wife and I had some friends and this room was talking about how she was in.
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:21.360]  No, it was her mother.
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:27.360]  Our friend's mother was traveling visiting family in Oregon and she went to the Buffalo
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:33.360]  Bill show because they, I guess they, there's a company does that around the country.
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:37.360]  And they read the Buffalo Bill show and they were just talking to some young man who was
[1:53:37.360 --> 1:53:39.360]  part of the Buffalo Bill show.
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  And he said, Oh, have you heard info wars.com and Alex Jones and then the mother of one
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:45.360]  of my friends was like, absolutely.
[1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:49.360]  And then suddenly there were more people there and they were talking about, Hey, everybody's
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:50.360]  awake here.
[1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:51.360]  We know what's going on.
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:57.360]  My only point in telling that story is that everywhere I go and everybody I talked to,
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:04.360]  they're having the same experiences and I get calls and I get letters from New York and
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:11.360]  Wisconsin and South Texas and Colorado and New Zealand.
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:15.360]  I had police departments call and say, did you do this?
[1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:20.360]  Did you spray paint info wars.com on this big derelict city building?
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:25.360]  And they'll send us a photo in New Zealand of info wars.com spray painted all across
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:26.360]  it.
[1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:30.360]  And I'm like, no, or I'll get a mean letter going.
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:37.360]  How dare you in these falls over the in Hawaii carve info wars into the rock or people spray
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:41.160]  painting road signs in Colorado, you know, thinking I'm doing it.
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:43.520]  The point is folks, it's everywhere.
[1:54:43.520 --> 1:54:49.260]  And then I realize we have tens of millions of people listening to us.
[1:54:49.260 --> 1:54:52.560]  We've actually got the attention of the people.
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:53.560]  What am I supposed to do?
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:58.840]  I mean, I, I mean, this, it's, it's, it's not even so much as a weight is that it's just
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:54:59.840]  almost embarrassing.
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:02.160]  I mean, I'm not the guy for this job.
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:06.680]  I'm not the guy to be the leader of the resistance against the new world order, but at the same
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:08.800]  time, who else is there?
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:09.800]  It's you.
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:11.240]  They can kill me individually.
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:12.760]  They can destroy my name.
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:14.640]  I've been analyzing their attack profile.
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:17.840]  They're more likely to invent scandals against me, but I'm so clean.
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:18.840]  I'm so square.
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:19.840]  It's hard to do.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:25.320]  But whatever they do to me, don't see the movement as about Alex Jones.
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:30.520]  See it as about liberty and freedom and realize you're a leader and that they can't kill
[1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:37.000]  ideas and that you by going out, handing out DVDs, handing out films, handing out articles,
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:41.300]  handing out websites, starting your own local radio shows, starting access TV, starting
[1:55:41.300 --> 1:55:47.160]  your own local activist group, by going out and going to city council and taking action.
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:49.600]  If you will take action, people will join you.
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:53.400]  If you will build it, they will come if you will engage the enemy.
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:56.480]  We can defeat them because the enemy's coming in like a flood now.
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:55:57.480]  There's no more denials.
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:55:59.480]  Open world government's been announced.
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:04.440]  And I always knew that this key juncture, that if I got out there and warned as many
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:08.480]  people as I could about the globalist plan and didn't hold back, a lot of other folks
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:09.480]  knew as much as I did.
[1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:12.440]  They just didn't want to sound kooky, so they only put a little bit out.
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:18.400]  I went all the way to the wall with the most radical info I could that was factual, knowing
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:25.000]  that people wouldn't believe me then, but that as it all came true, then they would
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:28.740]  remember and that it's that power of revelation.
[1:56:28.740 --> 1:56:34.000]  It's that power of the foresight that people pay attention to, and that by doing that,
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.440]  they would then wake up and get involved and join us.
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:38.440]  And we've done that.
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:41.520]  We planted tens of millions of seeds all across the world.
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:46.480]  And now those have grown mentally and spiritually, and they are planting seeds.
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:49.240]  And so the great harvest is coming.
[1:56:49.240 --> 1:56:51.600]  So the enemy's going to stage nuclear attacks.
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:53.200]  They're going to stage flu attacks.
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:56:56.120]  They're going to stage World War III type events, wars.
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.920]  They are going to bankrupt everything by design.
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:03.400]  They are going to bring in hell in an attempt to block us, but they were already going to
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:04.400]  do that.
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:07.160]  We're now just engaging them on our terms.
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:08.440]  They were attacking us anyways.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:10.520]  We're just decided to fight back.
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:12.960]  Some people say, well, you're goading them into moving quicker.
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:14.480]  Yes, we are.
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:16.520]  They're behind in the race.
[1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.480]  They don't have the pole position.
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:20.480]  We can force them to drive recklessly.
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:23.960]  We can force them to try to push the situation.
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:28.640]  That means that they've got the momentum and the power and the money, but we got the numbers
[1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:33.680]  and the truth, and that it's a fight of our lives, a fight for our lives, and we're going
[1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:38.480]  to go 110% of this fight, swinging as hard as we can, committing.
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:42.560]  And when you commit and stop carrying what happens to your body, what happens to your
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:48.520]  name, when you just get in the fight and go 110%, you're pretty much a shirt of victory,
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:52.560]  folks, if you'll just gut up and go absolutely A in the Info War.
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:53.560]  Hello, friends.
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:54.560]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:57.960]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:57:58.960]  important than ever.

[1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:08.640]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:11.040]  in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:14.320]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.

[1:58:56.280 --> 1:58:58.120]  in the Truth Movement for years.

[1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:13.040]  or Best Superfood of 2009.
