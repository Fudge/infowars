[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:40.000]  Well Bradley Manning has been given 35 years for the WikiLeaks documents
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  We have upwards of 1,300 that may have been killed in a apparent chemical
[00:46.000 --> 00:53.000]  weapon gas attack in the capital of Syria right as UN weapons inspectors arrive
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  and of course we've been reporting for two years Al Qaeda bragged and even
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  shot videos where they had chemical weapons on the edge of Syria and we're
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  going to use them against them and it's even come out in mainstream news that
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  some of those smaller chemical weapons attacks were clearly staged by Al Qaeda
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  and Syria has pointed out that they basically got Russians there as a third
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  party at their legal lawful chemical weapons depots the rebels have been
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  trying to take and have been guarding it in one case some of the jihadis got into
[01:27.000 --> 01:32.000]  a chemical weapon dump earlier this year and Israel bombed it that was one of the
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  bombings Israel didn't want Al Qaeda to get the chemical weapons so this is
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  just this is just a free for all ladies and gentlemen and Kurt Nemo's got a
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  story he's doing on this right now Fox News in fact I asked her to print it I
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  bet he did but I bet it's in the printer down the hall is already coming out as
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  of like 20 minutes ago I was in his office saying it's the Syrian government
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  that did it I mean no proof either we're sitting there reading the article it's
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  like when MSNBC says I'm deeply racist and behind the Boston bombing and that
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  all libertarians are as well and then gives no proof and it's the same thing
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  we're like read the article I'm in his office I'm well where does it say what's
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  the proof just doesn't say it just so so Kurt's doing a story on that but just
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  asking to actually print the Fox News story for me because I that's the
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  problem I realize I am like shell shocked by the amount of news information
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  unfolding and just trying to track all of it but I guess we all are it's the
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  information age experts say Syrian chemical weapons attack suspicious in
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  partial analysis cast doubt on timing of the story and of course this happened a
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  few months ago it happened earlier this year it happened last year this happened
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  what four times now and every time it comes out that it was the rebels that
[02:48.000 --> 02:55.000]  there have been the main suspects so even even mainstream media later in the back
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  of the paper has to admit that and again I'm no fan of Assad I don't have any
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  dog in the fight in Syria Assad is a dictator kind of a velvet gloved one but
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  I don't like that he's a lot better than his dad but there's no US interest in
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  destabilizing Syria there's really no even long-term interest for Israel from
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  many of the experts I've talked to his perspective of my own perspective and
[03:19.000 --> 03:27.000]  it's just totally immoral to put Al Qaeda in charge of the operation over there
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  and turn it over to them and give them all these weapons systems give them all
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  these different weapons systems really are looking at these children that have
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  been hit by nerve gas who've been paralyzed who they're trying to
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  resuscitate we're just showing some of that showing some of that video up on
[03:45.000 --> 03:57.000]  screen but it only makes sense for the military industrial complex and the big
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  banking combine perspective because they can always organize the crises or use
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  the crises to get more power to get more no-bid weapons contracts and to take
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  more of our liberties and there is a conscious worldwide move towards
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  gangsterism towards big above-the-law corporate combines who have insulated
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  themselves from their own international laws and who are just above the law and
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  then who are engaging in incredible war crimes through thinly veiled proxies
[04:28.000 --> 04:35.000]  like Saudi Arabian and Qatari jihadis so we're going to be looking at that when
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  we come back they've released the Hastings
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  Coroners report and boy does it have big holes in it we're going to be breaking
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  that down the day as well we're going to be looking at a whole host of issues

[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday
[08:32.000 --> 08:38.000]  the 21st day of August 2013 worldwide broadcast
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  we're going to have Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs pop in for about 10 minutes
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  at the bottom of the next hour to talk about his contacts
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  and information concerning the latest developments in the mysterious death of Michael Hastings
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  and I just want to tell you something
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  I'm not allowed to release the information I know about Michael Hastings
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  and quite frankly sometimes you wish you didn't have this info
[09:04.000 --> 09:10.000]  and I've checked it with other parties that lived and worked with Michael Hastings
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  and they've confirmed this this has been confirmed by other journalists
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  that have national television shows out of Los Angeles
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  the Young Turk producers this information is known
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  and everyone is too scared to release it
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  and I'm like then why am I even being told this information
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  well just in case something happens to us you know you know about it
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  and I'm like that's that's really great thank you for sharing this with me
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  when all our phones are tapped and the government knows who knows all this stuff
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  and it's very very irritating to say the least
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  and look I'm not blaming Staff Sergeant Biggs he's not scared he's the one going public
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  he is just as people telling him don't release this info
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  but I'll tell you this the FBI admitted last week they had a file on him
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.000]  and were tracking him and surveilling him and he was visited by a federal agency
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  that has all come out that they did do that
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  and they lied about that in the Michael Hastings case
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  and again there's a lot going on in the world at 1,300 people reportedly just got nerve-gassed
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  over in the capital of Syria right when UN inspectors show up right on time
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  so they can now take that false flag I mean it's clearly a false flag
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  it's targeting a world population that just kind of halfway watches television with one eye
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  and just believes whatever they're told they can announce that flying pigs just attacked Paris
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  and spit acid out of their snouts and burned down the Eiffel Tower
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  and people would believe it I mean it is unbelievable what's going on
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  what people will buy into and we've got all this happening
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  I just mentioned the Hastings thing because it is so frustrating
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  to have someone send out an email saying the feds are coming after me look out
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  they're going to be you know raiding our offices they've are you know
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  I'm going off the radar big story breaking and then his car blows up
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  the trees not even really damaged the witnesses say it blows up while driving down the middle of the street
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  and look I'll say this 95% chance they blew him up
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  there is in my brain a 5% chance that he was on drugs
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  that he was paranoid and that the fame got to him
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.000]  kind of like the Coney 2012 guy did you know running around naked in the middle of California
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  in the middle of what was it San Diego screaming I'm God
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  kind of like TSA agents routinely do they stripped down naked repeatedly and run around screaming I'm God
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  I'm not joking you can look that up it's a syndrome of narcissism that's gone to the edge
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  Hastings did not come off like a narcissist according to what I know
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  and people that knew him well but somebody that was really into reality and really into adventure
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  but he could have cracked up and then I guess magically his car blown up the middle of the street
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  as now six different witnesses say and now as and they tried to suppress all those reports
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  this looks like a setup I've always said over and over again if they kill me because I've studied
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  how they tend to kill journalists and people they will shoot me with a
[12:23.000 --> 12:30.000]  this is one of the most common things a cyanide ice dart that just puts like a needle hole in you
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  and then you die in about a minute from a heart attack from the cyanide you just shut down
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  going into your bloodstream then they take your body most of that metabolizes out very hard for a corner
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  to even find it and they kill some hooker and stick you in a hotel room with a heroin needle in your arm
[12:47.000 --> 12:58.000]  and they can also inject the breakdown elements of other hard drug use to show the derivatives
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  of drugs in your body they can extract that out of cadavers you name it and show a whole spectrum of drugs in you
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  or they could car jack me or run a truck into me after I'd already been killed
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  it's one of the popular fun ways they do things or just have a guy pop up in a black ski mask
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  one day when I'm getting in my car and shooting me in the head and then they just say I was
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.000]  who knows why I was shot in the head it happens to a lot of people that's what they do
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  but you notice if you're a long-time listener or even a short time you know I make the point when they kill people
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.000]  that if I ever get found dead of a drug overdose folks I don't use illegal drugs
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  I mean I can have a broken leg I don't take opiates I'm violently allergic to them
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  sort of throwing up everywhere I don't use any illegal drugs
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  so if and I've never been a big drug user I experimented some in high school
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  and just hated everything I ever tried I was like people pay for this stuff
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  so if that ever happens it's not true and by the way his family has now come out
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  and said he did not use methamphetamine they're saying he had methamphetamine in him
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  they're saying he had marijuana in his system which he reportedly had a medical card for for PTSD
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  from all the combat he was in the middle of for many years as a combat reporter
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  embedded and he reportedly was not a DMT user either
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  so they're saying that it looked like he'd been on DMT
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.000]  by the way folks you can't tie your shoelaces you can't even get out of your chair when you're on DMT
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  you don't even know where you are I mean you get teleported to you know just another dimension
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  or another area of your brain it's like a deep dream
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  and so this looks really really bad
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  remember this is the same LA coroners where Breitbart drops dead
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  they announced 45 minutes after he's dead that it's not any foul play which that's very suspicious
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  and then the coroner dies of arsenic poisoning
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  the coroner dies who worked on Breitbart
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  I mean maybe Breitbart did have heart problems
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  I've talked to folks that knew him and they said that guy was burning the candle on both ends
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  and had a history of heart problems and so maybe he did die
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  my point is is they shot Gary Webb who won the Pulitzer Prize for exposing CIA drug dealing
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  a month before his book was going to be coming out and then by the way
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  then the publisher didn't release it after some stuff went on behind the scenes
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  and he got shot twice in the side of the head
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  and it said he'd had his kids move out in with his ex-wife because people kept breaking in his house
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  who he described as special forces who would slide down the drain pipe from the second story
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  special forces style you know with their feet on it shooting down it
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  like something out of the born supremacy or something
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  they wanted him to know they were in there constantly
[15:55.000 --> 16:00.000]  so he moved out of that house, moved to another city, told everybody they may kill me
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  and then they killed him
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  I mean it's just unbelievable that if I die it's not suicide
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  it's like Vince Foster where they drag him to the park, clean everything up
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  witnesses see him getting drugged there
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  I mean it just goes on and on and on
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  and I'm just sick of these gangsters being able to kill whoever they want whenever they want
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  and get away with it
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  so Hastings autopsy traces of meth found in body
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  but Crash caused death is the report and goes on
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  but a Hastings final member had a surprising reaction when contacted by who, what, why
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  calling the coroner's report irresponsible
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  I can honestly say with absolute certainty that he wasn't doing meth
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  the family member requested anonymity told who, what, why in an email
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  methamphetamine can be nasal spray, pseudofed
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  one of those upper drinks at the gas station
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  and yeah the family members right we did a report on this last night
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  there are hundreds of products that will show methamphetamine in you
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  that's why when you go get a nasal spray
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  or you go get a pseudofed
[17:10.000 --> 17:13.000]  or you go get Claren and they want you to sign for it so your driver's license
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.000]  because you can take that home and cook it up and make methamphetamine with it
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  because that's what it is
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  that's why I don't matter how bad my allergies get I don't want to take that
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  because it turns me into a freak, a mean freak
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  I mean that gives me a mean streak a mile wide folks
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  but sure lets me go jogging far
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  I'll tell you that I take one of those 24-hour Claren
[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  a couple years ago and I lost a bunch of weight and I could go run like five miles
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  definitely speed that's why I don't take it anymore
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  but I'm losing weight right now by the way with none of that
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  I'm losing weight right now just exercising and the beyond taking tangerine
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  the modifying and seaweed and the rest of it but
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  it's weird when you really start losing weight all of a sudden it starts coming off
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  and then that's when you got to hit it
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  but side issue
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  I'm done talking about that
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  until he pops in for ten minutes
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  at the bottom of the next hour we're going to have open phones
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  for the rest of the broadcast and I'm really going to try to go to your phone calls
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  earlier in this hour rather than later so I don't
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  hold people to the end of the show and then go into overdrive again
[18:15.000 --> 18:17.000]  I apologize that I'm constantly doing that
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  let me give you the really big news now obviously
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  and we're going to be breaking all this down throughout the show today
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  as more comes out
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  opposition says as many as one thousand three hundred killed
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  in gas attack near Damascus
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  they call the sixty percent al-qaeda forces the rest jihadis

[19:05.000 --> 19:08.000]  and they're getting the French variant of the toad
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  they're getting the Chinese variant of the toad
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  what's it called the red arrow or something
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.000]  let's look that up just for factoid purposes of the Chinese version of the toad
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  and there's all these videos they're just being given
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  here have some anti-tank missiles
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  these really are good for shooting down airliners as well

[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  you want to shoot something four miles away line of sight here
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  perfect targeting here have this
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  and they're like throwing Christians off roofs blowing up churches
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  and then now the media keeps going

[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  and he's like I would never do that you're the ones

[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  by the way, coming up at the start of the next segment
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  I'm going to get into a story that our own Julie Wilson filed
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  last night for infowars.com
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.000]  that's up on the left hand column of Drudge about halfway down
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  and I like this article
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  because it's not sensational, it's just dryly written
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  but I think we should probably do another one
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  explaining the article to people
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  because it's so dry
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  that it's...
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  folks need to understand why this is so important
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  that they're hiring more role players
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  to play the part of terrorists
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  to then sneak around pretending to be terrorists
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  to see if the police and military can catch them
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  and doing these drills
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  live time in major cities
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  because these companies generally are not involved
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  in what happens but the criminal elements
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  of the government
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  and the corporations that control it
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  have been caught over and over again
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  staging events on top of these drills
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  and sometimes they tell the role players
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  here carry this backpack into the sports stadium
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  or onto the bus or onto the train
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  and then they blow them up
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  and I just want to tell you if you're a cop
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  or you're a military
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  especially if you're a Muslim
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  but they're kind of segueing away from that right now
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  and you're a secular type guy
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  or you're a Muslim but you're more western style
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  as you call it reformed
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  you're the people they're going to set up
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  and look, most of the time they're going to hire you for a drill
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  and you're going to get paid a thousand bucks
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  and nobody's going to get blown up
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  but this is the real deal
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  and most people again
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  that are even running these companies
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  have no idea what's going on
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  just like the Boston bombing
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  they had multiple drills
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  that later came out
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  we were confirmed to be right
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  Boston Globe
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  they had military contractors
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  they had craft international out there
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  and the director of that got his head blown off
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  I mean this is really really dangerous stuff
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  okay and I watched the body language in the video
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  of all of the special forces, sheep, dip guys
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  when the bomb went off they weren't involved
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  they were like what's going on
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  well running around with their black backpacks
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  they were there
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  to take part in a drill
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  and the feds may have lied to them
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  and said there's going to be a real terror attack
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  but we're going to tell the public
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  if they ask questions it's a drill
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  which they did do
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  it came out on local news
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  and the Boston Globe
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  and then on Alabama news
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  when they went and talked to a professor
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  who was also there
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  three different sources that
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.000]  were like why all the dogs
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  why all the backpacks
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  why the troops
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  oh sir it's just a bomb drill
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  boom
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  I mean there was a bomb drill
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  see I said I'd cover this next segment
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  but it actually can segue back
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  into what we were already covering
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  and then back into the story I just mentioned
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  in the next segment it's longer
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  when you watch this over and over again
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  you just learn the patterns
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  7-7 in 2005
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  I was there a week after it happened
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  I flew there to cover it
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  and I was approached by MI5
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  and others and told
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  when I was just back in England
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  a few months ago
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  that I was absolutely correct
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  and one of them came to me
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  and said we want to know
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  this is when I was at the BBC
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.000]  I was pulled aside
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  we want to know how you knew that
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  so quickly
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  about DeMendes
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  the electrician
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  that obviously knew too much
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  that they executed
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  and I said well I put two and two together
[28:05.000 --> 28:06.000]  I've studied this
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  and they were like well
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  and the guy was so intense
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  so intense
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  I could tell it was like a threat
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  or what it was
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  he just kept going
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  well let me just tell you
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  you're absolutely correct
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  we can't believe you're so accurate
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  and he's like basically
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  who are you working with
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  who are you really
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  and that guy just kept going
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  and you're like inside the BBC
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  and it's a guy in a suit
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  it's not the regular security people
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  and I'm like well who are you
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  well let's just say it's not MI6
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  it's one number lower
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  and this guy was just like
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  I want to know
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  we're very interested in that
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  we're very
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  we just only shake your hand
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  we're very
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  we really want to know
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  how you know that
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  and I was just like whoa
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  and then they had a guy
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  follow us outside
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  he said the same thing
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  the crew saw that
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  and then there's a
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Bilderberg group member
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  in the hallway
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  I mean we've got video
[28:58.000 --> 28:59.000]  of that conversation
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  I mean my life is a
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  Twilight Zone episode
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  I'm telling you right now
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  and we also ran into
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  some nice MI5 people
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  who actually gave us great info
[29:10.000 --> 29:11.000]  days earlier
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  but I'm kind of
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  see that's the problem
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  with any story
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  I've got to give you background
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  on why I know things
[29:17.000 --> 29:18.000]  but the point is
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  they had drills of the
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  exact same trains
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  and exact bus bombed
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  at the exact same locations
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  at the exact same time
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  and we had an insurance
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  actuary done on it
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  for Terror Storm
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  and I forget how many
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  tricked a Gillian
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  but it was billions of times
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  all the grains of sand in the world
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  that that would happen that way
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  and then we had BBC reports
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.000]  and ITN admitting
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  it was you know
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  astronomically impossible
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  and they're like
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.000]  well why do you throw it
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  in our face then
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  so I'm going to explain this
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  and tie it into the Syria
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  nerve gas attack
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  when we come back
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.000]  We're on the march
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  The Empire's on the run
[29:53.000 --> 29:56.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  Are we choosing our own destiny
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  or has it been pre-selected for us?
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  As we've moved through history
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  every great leader
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.000]  has had to understand
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  the potential of information
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  Billions of dollars have been
[30:11.000 --> 30:13.000]  spent privately and publicly
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  looking at how to tap into your psyche
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  From compulsory state education
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  we are kept in perpetual bondage
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  to the ideas that shape our actions
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  between you observing
[30:30.000 --> 30:31.000]  and testing it out
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.000]  and verifying it
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.000]  they can take total control
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  of your awareness
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  All of this is happening so fast
[30:35.000 --> 30:37.000]  you need to be ahead of the game
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  How to engineer the opinion
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  of the American people
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  so that they would not only endorse
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  but demand a war
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  Out of another one
[30:45.000 --> 31:01.000]  Another one, another plane to take
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  Hydrofluorosalic acid
[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  Advanced manufacturing technology

[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  Thank you so much for joining us
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  The toll free number to get involved
[33:38.000 --> 33:39.000]  on air specifically
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  I'd like to get your take
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.000]  on the supposed chemical weapons
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  attack that's happened
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  over in the capital of Syria
[33:47.000 --> 33:48.000]  Damascus
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  and of course the other news
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  that we're going to be breaking down today
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.000]  I'm also going to give my review
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  of the act of killing
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  that is the most disturbing movie
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  I have ever seen
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  and I do not recommend
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  that the faint of heart go see it
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  It takes a lot to disturb me
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  and I feel like I have been dipped
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  in degeneracy and scum and evil
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  and my skin is crawling
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  Horner Herzog says this is the greatest movie
[34:20.000 --> 34:21.000]  he's ever been involved in
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  he produced it
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  they had an interview
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  he did at the Alamo Draft House
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  aired before it
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  he was just smacking his lips
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  he is a great director
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  about how this was the greatest work ever
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  there won't be anything like this for 30 years
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  it's got like the highest rotten tomatoes
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  rating ever of like 97%
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  and it made me just want to vomit
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  I mean this, because it was real
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  and knowing what I know about tyrants
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  and how the thug system operates
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  and the spirit of thugism
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  that empowers tyranny
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.000]  I went with David Knight and the crew
[34:56.000 --> 34:57.000]  and David Knight
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.000]  I said David what do you think of the movie
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.000]  and he said makes me want to go out
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  and buy more guns
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  so I will give that review
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  at the start of the next hour
[35:04.000 --> 35:05.000]  come hook or crook
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  and I'll play the trailer for it
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  so you kind of get an idea
[35:08.000 --> 35:09.000]  of what I'm talking about
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  and the only reason I'm going to discuss it
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  is because as a document it's very important
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  any anthropologist, sociologist
[35:16.000 --> 35:17.000]  people that want to know
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  what the third world's like
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  man this is it
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  and let me tell you
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  I won't ever be getting anywhere near Indonesia
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  I mean I know it's already one of the most
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  hellish places on earth
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  but my goodness
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  Obama was actually
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  there as a child in the one year
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  when the one million people got killed
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  and his mother as a CIA operative
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  with the husband
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  the cut out husband
[35:44.000 --> 35:45.000]  there in the government district
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  he was involved in the death squads
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.000]  and then I just started thinking about
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  how bad Obama is man
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  he has a pedigree of like
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  Satan himself
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  the weird communist pornographer
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  dad I mean it's definitely
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  Davis
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  and then his mom and then her
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  with all these operatives and people
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  I mean it is just
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  and then you see how evil he is
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  and how much he loves conning people
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  and how much he loves hurting black people
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  especially doubling the abortion funding
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  and just in how he sits there
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.000]  and tells everybody he loves them
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  and he's coming and he's going to help them
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  I mean I've been blindsided
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  by how evil Obama is
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  the movie by the way is not about Obama
[36:27.000 --> 36:30.000]  it's just that I've been wanting to throw up
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.000]  ever since last night in fact
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  I'm like having basically flashbacks right now
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  and the average person will go watch it
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  and probably say yeah it is disgusting
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  and sick and everything but I mean
[36:43.000 --> 36:44.000]  when you study evil all the time
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  and you see this it's just like
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  oh my gosh
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  it's like
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  the most disgusting thing you can imagine
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  late as gravy over the
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  something else that's horrible
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  it's like a giant
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  I hate to be gross try to describe it
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  like at a level of my gut
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  but it's like a giant soup
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  just the most horrid
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  disgusting humiliating things
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  with degenerate toddling
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  inhuman scum drunk on power
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  wallowing
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  wallowing in their evil
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  and their fraud and their ugliness
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  and proud of it
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  you know I got disgusted by that
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  kid with the rat life how he drives a
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  Cadillac Escalade and
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  is on welfare and gets food stamps
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  and is laughing at taxpayers
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  paying for his lobster every day
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  and how he's proud of it with all his friends
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  laughing at everyone on Fox News
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  and it's a spirit ladies and gentlemen
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  it's not just that they're corrupt
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  and have problems we all have problems
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  it's that they don't want to reach towards
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  the good and try to build beautiful
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  good strong things
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  they don't want to lift people up they
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  like squalor death destruction
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  pain lies fraud
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  trampling what's good
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  and they're at war
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  with anything beautiful and good
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  because they don't even want to be
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  part of the beauty and build it up
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  and be greater themselves they hate beauty
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  and
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  purity and goodness
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  and man
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  I'm in the movie and there's this beautiful
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  young waitress
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  because it's it's you know
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  they have food at the movie theater
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  it's where we like to go there and we're
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  sitting there and I'm eating while I'm watching
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  this and there's a
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  you know a beautiful human being
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  serving us and it was just
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  like it was degenerate to be there
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  and to be sitting there in a comfortable
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  chair eating with a beautiful
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  maiden serving us
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  watching this it was
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  it was the juxtaposed
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  to made it even worse it was like a hallucination
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  I mean no wonder
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  it's got the highest rating ever on rotten
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  tomatoes and IMDB and stuff
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  because it is just blasphemous
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  but they're not
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  being blasphemous Werner Herzog
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  and the anonymous directors they don't
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  want to get killed by the death squads
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  they're showing you
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  evil
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  I
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  have never seen anything this powerful
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  I mean hands down
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  it was like a journey into
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  hell
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  I think I've already done the review haven't I
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  the problem is because I say
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  I don't script this show I know what I'm going to talk about
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  what I'm interested in and then I just boom and then
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  I start mentioning something and I'm off
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  the racists
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  and I saw the thuggishness
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  and the arrogance and the
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  and it reminded me of his first state of the
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  union when Biden does this mafia smile
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  to
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house then
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  and Obama
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  and they all just have this disgusting
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  openly evil
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  openly leering
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  smile that you know
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  killers have when they've got a kid tied down
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  a two year old they're going to rape for a month straight
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  they'll use them up as psychopaths call it
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  and it's been reportedly because
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  they've had police films and stuff with people film
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  this stuff these people have these demonic
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  Joker smiles and it's just they
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  love it and they just love
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  that they can hurt good and lie
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  to everyone and then make us degenerate
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  and poison the food and water
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  and poison the culture and degenerate
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  everything and attack everything
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  good and prosecute everything pure
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  and attack innocence
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  and then just the earth has been turned
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  over to every disgusting
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  ugly piece of
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  trash
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  toll free number to join us
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  800-259-9231
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  800-259-9231
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  800-259-9231
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  800-259-9231
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  I will say this now though
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  if I knew how bad this was
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  if people go seeing oh that's not that violent
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  it's real folks it's not simulated
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  like the stupid shows they've got on HBO
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  where the serial killer you know kills the
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  patriot or kills the right wanger or kills
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  the guy that slaps his wife and
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  tortures them to death you know it makes
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  it all sexy and cute this isn't
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  that's how they sell it this is the
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  real deal and
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  watching these degenerate pieces
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  of garbage
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  sit there and just get off
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  on their nastiness
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  hmm
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  excuse me
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  excuse me
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  I do not and now I do not recommend
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  I recommend everybody
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  that wants to be a gangster or a thug
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  or a tough guy I recommend
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  all the steroid head cops that
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  you know they're getting into the tyranny and can't wait
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  to do whatever they want and kind of like a
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  moth to the flame of evil
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  and the orgy of bloodletting they want to have
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  in the war they want to have the American people
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  I recommend you all go see
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  this
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  and I recommend fathers go see it if you want
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  to know what you're facing under a tyranny
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  by the way I can't even look
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  at the videos of all of
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  these nerve gas dead children
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  and the rest of them that are paralyzed
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  punch up info wars.com
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  the still photos are enough
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  don't don't don't don't show
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  the video they're showing all over the news
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  you know we show a collateral damage video of troops
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  US troops shooting up a vehicle full
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  of kids they can air it on
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  CNN because they whitewash it or Fox
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  that's okay if we put it on YouTube they take our channel down
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  but
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  all over the news they're showing the nerve gas
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  little kids right now
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  and see I've got a five year old little
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  darling innocent
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  I got a nine year old I got a ten year old
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  you don't know what it's like to have children
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  you can't imagine them like that
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  it tears your heart out you have empathy
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  you experience it and you realize
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  evil people don't experience it
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  they just know it manipulates good people
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  and that's another thing I watch them sit there just
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  prodding us with their pitchfork
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  the devil prodding us to do what he wants
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  with the crimes the globalists
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  commit
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  and then it's so obvious two days after the
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  UN inspector show up in Damascus
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  nerve gas gets released and hits
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  kids how
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  convenient and they've already caught
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  the the the Al Qaeda rebels at the
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  west backs we're going to report on this
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  now the news are compiling all the stories
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  right now three times
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  three
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  separate
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  times and the reason I say don't show the
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  kids I can't look at it
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  three separate times
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  they have nerve gas small
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  areas and areas they control
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  and then it's come out later that indeed
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  it was the rebels doing
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  and then you get John McCain
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  and Lindsey Graham and Obama going
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  listen you cross the red
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  line of using any chemical weapons we're
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  going to attack you and the Russians go and
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  stay at the chemical bases that are legal
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  and lawful these governments have them and say of
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  course no one's going to use these
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  and now right when the UN's there they do
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  this and reportedly there's
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  1300 killed that's coming from the rebels
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  we don't know they probably
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  trucked in a school bus of you know their own
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  kids and nerve gas to me you know kids from
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  kids that they'd captured
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  because there's no way
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  I mean you've got the president Assad coming
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  out for two years saying they're going to frame us
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  for nerve gassing we would never do this
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  nerve gas isn't a good weapon
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  unless it's a terror weapon
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  and you know we're winning
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  the offensives we're taking the country back
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  we're not going to do this
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  and they want to start
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  the air campaign the no fly
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  bomb zone that the peace prize president
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  launches because you know when they drop a bomb
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  on the department building are they level
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  you know large percentages of major cities
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  in places like
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Libya that's not war
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  that's a non
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  military kinetic action
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  Carney's now calling him
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  or a non lethal lethal
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  kinetic action because even though it's lethal
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  if you say it's non lethal that makes it okay
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  and again it's the spectacle
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  of them doing all
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  this I mean it's
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  there is
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  no reason Assad would do
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  something like this and the other groups been caught
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  doing it over and over again and the
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  timing and then they
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  go ahead and punch up the little kid on the respirator
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  and these kids all have neurological problems
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  ones that live the rest of their life
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  a bunch of them
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  are are actually
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  dead there's videos
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  of just piles of dead kids
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  and
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  my basic human instinct is to
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  absolutely be enraged
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  by dead little children
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  but everybody's playing these video games
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  where zombies are eating little kids
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  and you know there's there's
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  movies
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  there's all these shows where you've got serial killer
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  doctors that
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  you know kill people that they don't
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  like but it's cool because you know they're a cool
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  serial killer
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  and I mean there's a whole bunch of these shows
[45:55.000 --> 45:57.000]  what's one on HBO, Dexter
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  Showtime
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  yeah I mean I've only seen snippets of this stuff
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  you know here and there online and it's
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  and I talk to people that watch it
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  and it's all sexy to be friends with a serial killer
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  see now it's not scary
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  and you can dabble in being a serial killer
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  you know living vicariously through one
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  meanwhile folks
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  in America today there'll be scores
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  of children grabbed out of their backyards
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  and they'll just be on a milk carton
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  and the serial killers
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  run the government run the country basically
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  and now they're teaching you to love
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  who they are
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  now speaking of false flags
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  this story is by
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Julie Wilson up on
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  infowars.com
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  it's also on drudgereport.com
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  on the middle of the left hand column
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  easiest place to find it
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  San Antonio
[46:47.000 --> 46:49.000]  yeah yeah
[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  no I've got a separate article over here
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  San Antonio Express News but yes
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  San Diego
[46:55.000 --> 46:57.000]  Craigslist ad searches
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  for surveillance role players
[46:59.000 --> 47:01.000]  and
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.000]  why is this important
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.000]  company specializing
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  in response to national
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  security challenges seeks new employees
[47:09.000 --> 47:11.000]  and I'm sure this company isn't involving
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.000]  the various why they just want to hire
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  high level security clearance former military personnel
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  and others to
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  play the role basically of terrorists
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  if you read the ad to then be
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  at public events to test security
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  the issue is
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  in every major false flag
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  Boston 7-7 in London
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  9-11
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  and countless other events
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  gladio operations
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  the Russians have been caught staging
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  terror attacks against themselves before
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  in 1999 and they told local police
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  oh the FSB did oh we're taking
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  part in a drill
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  of blowing up this fourth building
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  with real explosives they just blown up
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  three the week before as a pretext
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  to crack down and get Putin elected
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  and all the evidence points towards that being
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  an FSB operation same thing
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  it's a drill oh there was a drill
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  this is how you cover up
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  the real op and I know we've talked
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  about this at nauseam
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  but NATO's
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  been caught doing it the Russians have been caught doing it
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  our government in
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  in operations like Northwood's
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  talks about having drills as the cover
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  for blowing stuff up
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  mass shootings plastic explosive
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  bombs at public events in America
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  to basically start war with Cuba
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  and the Soviet Union
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  and Kennedy killed that program
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  the point is this is what they do
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  and so you've got these programs happening everywhere
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  companies specializing
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  in response to national security challenges
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  seeks new employees a recent post
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  on the San Diego Craigslist website
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  advertises the need
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  for motivated surveillance roleplayers
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  and scenario driven
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  political exercise
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  or practical exercise roleplayers
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  or RP's
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  the ad claims to be looking to fill these positions
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  to support military training activities
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  in the San Diego California region
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  now this
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  they have a lot of drills just to create the perception
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  there's real terrorists to create fear
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  and to simulate it with the police
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  okay and then also
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  have local newscast about it later
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  if they go public with the drill to create the perception
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  it's a real threat so that's what the majority are
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  I'd say 90% or more
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  then out of the other 10%
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  you will have it where they tell
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  people there's a real terror threat
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  and then see if the police
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  can catch the roleplayers
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  to actually test response
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  but then in 234%
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  of the time out of that
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  you know 10%
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  and I'm just guesstimating here dead reckoning from research
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  they go and they hire college students
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  or whoever the case is
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  or they hire people that have been shaped by the CIA
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  like the Zarnaev brothers
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Zohar and Tamerlin
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  who it came out were
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  the older brother definitely was on CIA payroll
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  Jamestown Foundation sent to Chechnya
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  to infiltrate al-Qaeda groups funded by the west
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  that's all on record
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  the drill, the stand down, their friends getting killed
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  the cover up, the FBI guys that arrested them are dead
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  it goes on and on
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  and they had drills there
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  that's now been confirmed
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  they had a drill where a patriot group
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  was going to bomb
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  the event
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  but of course they had fallbacks
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  they had Saudis there
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  that the first lady visited
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  they had these cutouts
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  who were supposedly Chechen terrorists
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  well the Chechen terrorists are run by the west on record
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  against Russia
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  so again it's all this cloak and dagger stuff
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  same deal
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  and so this talks about a minimum of 5 years
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  counterintelligence
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  or human intelligence, humed experience
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  with a less of 2 operational deployments
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  military
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  speciality or a member
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  of a civilian intelligence community organization
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  of a civilian intelligence
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  community organization
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  that's all the spy networks they've already got set up

[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.680]  Activists say I mean they won't even call the paramilitary Al-Qaeda forces with even heavy weapons
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:17.880]  They won't even call them activists or protesters kind of like the Muslim Brotherhood firebombing shooting police
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:25.560]  They kill 25 in one day. They're killing police and military every day in Egypt. They're starting it and they're called protesters
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.720]  I mean, you know, what if you went out and killed 25 cops?
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.880]  Would you would you be on the news as a as a protester? That's what I mean folks. We are under assault by propaganda
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.320]  We are under just absolute total assaults
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.320]  We're gonna be going to your phone calls
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.480]  Getting into all that
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:49.420]  Every day I see without even looking and I don't cover it just because I guess I've been conditioned
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:57.880]  Where black folks young people mainly are killing white people randomly and there's another article on drudgereport.com murder shocks Heartland
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.520]  The cops say board black teams killed white baseball player for fun. I pulled the trigger and
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:12.920]  The media won't even call it a racist crime and and again you you see the media in the culture MSNBC
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.560]  They say white people are inherently bad
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:22.800]  And it's not even reverse racism. How is it reverse anybody can be racist folks. It's tribalism
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:28.120]  What do you think a country club is where the richest people in town are in a country club and don't anybody else in it
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.840]  And they even are mean to the people there that are only worth of you know
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.400]  $100 billion and aren't worth a billion dollars. I
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:39.600]  Mean the best country club in Austin's got billionaires like you know 20 billionaires or something that remembers
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.720]  I mean and believe me folks. I've talked to people that go there
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.520]  They're mean to you if you're just a US senator and you know are only worth 50 million dollars. That's tribalism
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.720]  That's a lead is them. That's clicks that and so yeah, they'll use skin color. They'll use religion. They'll use whatever
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.720]  But there's this idea that only white people
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:05.520]  Are tribalist the whole world's tribalist go to Indonesia. You got like 20 different groups killing each other forever
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.600]  Look at Africa tribes killing each other just 24-7. I mean, I'm sick of the West
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.000]  Because I've traveled the world a little bit, but I've seen a lot of documentaries too in the third world and let me tell you
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.640]  Western civilization what Western Europe deployed and developed is is is is
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:31.720]  Is hands down the greatest contribution to human society and development the world's ever seen the Japanese contributed a lot
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.280]  Chinese contributed a lot to civilization
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:41.580]  There was some contributions of civilization out of Africa. There have been contributions out of Mesoamerica all those places have had contributions
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600]  But you can hands down
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:49.680]  Say that Western civilization has made the most contributions now is Western civilization on a lot of evil stuff
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:57.160]  Yeah, we're all humans. We all act the same, but I am just so sick of the constant drumbeat
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:04.520]  By the elite against Western civilization because here's the deal. They don't want you to have it Obama goes to Africa
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.760]  He lives in the you know the cradle of Western civilization wealth and power and sci-fi
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Technology he goes to Africa and says you can't have hot water. You can't have cars
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.600]  It's bad for the earth. By the way, I got 500 secret service with me about 10 aircraft landed
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.320]  It cost me, you know millions of dollars a day to be here
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.160]  And blah blah blah and but you can't have hot running water
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.680]  That's what's behind the trendiness of running Western civilization now
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.560]  You know what go move to Calcutta, India go move to Jakarta, Indonesia
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:48.040]  Don't move to Mexico City, please please please. I'm just so sick of all these movies like Elysium and everything else
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:54.280]  Acting like the West is bad. What did Jim Morrison say? The West is the best
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.160]  The West is the best
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:05.080]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:13.400]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease?
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.480]  It all comes down to one thing
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:21.760]  We are what we eat our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives

[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.520]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.720]  At about 40 after we're going to have pop in to the broadcast
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.040]  The personal friend of Michael Hastings
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.560]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:04.400]  To give his take on the autopsy information released that the family is saying is not accurate that he did not use methamphetamines
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.040]  So
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.560]  Looks like the demonization has begun. You can also take a
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.720]  Suda fed or hundreds of other different products or chemicals or drinks that will give a false positive
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:22.200]  for amphetamine use so very very suspicious on that front big news in Syria
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.960]  Obviously, they're saying between a hundred and
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.960]  1300 dead, you know, it's the rebels saying that so who knows but horrible footage of nerve gas children
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.760]  Blaming it on a sod and they keep saying a sod of you use nerve gas
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.560]  We're going to have the last bomb and invade you
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.560]  So it's getting a very very very suspicious that that's a staged
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160]  set up frame up
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.080]  Going on also San Diego Craigslist had calls for roleplayers
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.720]  To basically play the part who are former human intelligence CIA
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:59.920]  You name it or part of citizens tattletale squads to play the part of basically terrorist
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.560]  in in secret drills
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.400]  And if you know anything about drills those are usually accompanied
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:12.040]  Or terrorist events are generally accompanied by a drill that's used as the cover story
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.320]  So very very suspicious report on that front
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.520]  That's up on info wars comm and halfway down to the left-hand side of the drugs report
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.920]  Com as well covering the info wars comm article there. So we're going to be getting into that
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440]  There's a lot of other news. I want to get to
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.920]  There is a story here
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.560]  That's up on info wars comm
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.680]  dealing with
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.640]  Black youths killing a white youth because they were quote bored and just wanted to have fun
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.260]  And I'm seeing this literally every day
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:55.360]  Where groups are attacked or robbed or killed and it's usually just a regional news story never a national news story
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.640]  Because the media wants to have the idea that only white people are racist and then only white people are bad
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.640]  And it's mainly white people
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.320]  In the media and the power structure that are doing this because they want to solve each other's throats
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.440]  And when I say that the Western civilization is under attack and is dying
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  The West is committing suicide
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:20.240]  The West the West the idea of a bill of rights a constitution common law
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.880]  That's what's so great about Western civilization doesn't mean the West is perfect
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.320]  And all cultures have contributed things
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.040]  But why is there such a concerted attack on Western civilization and why does the media always say everyone should adopt anything?
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:41.400]  but Western culture because they want a post industrial world for everyone folks
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:49.160]  They're blocking the third world's development which I am fighting against you're fighting against Lord Monkton's fighting and they're fighting to deindustrialize us
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.840]  We need to we need to export the good parts of Western civilization
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:00.440]  If people want to adopt them and the truth is people in the third world do that's why they want to come to the West
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:08.960]  But the West itself is being deindustrialized from within and it's being eradicated because Western civilization in its truest
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.200]  Renaissance Enlightenment form
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.760]  Is in direct?
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:18.160]  Contravention with what the globalists want that is a neo-futalistic
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.280]  fascism worldwide
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.440]  They want to go back to pre
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.440]  Renaissance that's what we call Western civilization. It's not really Western civilization
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.640]  Western civilization was feudalist just like Mesoamerica just like Asia just like Africa
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:42.160]  It all had the same system Kings lords slaves unless you had hunter-gatherer groups in small pockets in Eastern Europe
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.560]  What's Eastern Europe today?
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:50.640]  North America, but still those groups were at war with each other. So and you study human systems Western civilization
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.840]  That idea of the that's really the Renaissance
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.760]  I've studied it all that's where we want to go. I mean, that's my view
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:07.200]  Private property the family sacrosanct due process the smallest person has the same rights as the as as the most powerful
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:16.760]  Powerful groups of gangs can't get together and just overrun you because they've got the force to do it or 51% vote to take your property
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.640]  The problem is ultra rich
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:28.000]  Always want to use the mob rule of pure democracy or or a crisis to take over and dominate
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.600]  Now smart elites in the Enlightenment said well actually we're always getting robbed and overthrown overtaken
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.000]  Because we've got all the wealth and and we're abusing the serfs
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.560]  So let's actually create a more equitable system and they'll have such wealth
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.520]  We could skim off the top of that
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.960]  That's why they kind of let the Renaissance go ahead and happen. They tried to block it for a while
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:54.920]  They just couldn't it was too popular. It was too cool. It was it was the idea of science getting out
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:04.240]  Innovation the rock stars were musicians classical musicians scientists explorers not basketball to baseball players
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:12.720]  But you know an upward society the rock stars are mathematicians the rock stars are trailblazers the the the rock
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.720]  I mean, you know, then the kids think that's cool
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:23.400]  Then you go to you know space colonies and people start living to be 500 years old and you know, we go to the next level of human development that God I
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.240]  Guaranteed you'll let us have if we're able to pass the test
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:33.880]  But no, no, no, we can't do that. We have to have old-fashioned tyranny thugism and it's reigning
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.640]  Supreme worldwide ladies and gentlemen now I want to go to this report. We're gonna come back from break and go to your phone calls
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640]  There's a very powerful report
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:47.000]  That's up on info wars.com and I hope that you will share this with people
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.840]  So that folks are aware of what's happening
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.120]  Kit Daniels did a blurb on it. It's gun confiscation begins in
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:01.080]  California and then a few months ago that was actually the headline that Bloomberg had but they said it was a great thing and
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.720]  They're now going to go after people that haven't even been adjudicated mentally ill
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.440]  Just they come grab you and say we heard you shoot your mouth off
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.920]  This has been happening about Obama in North Carolina, Florida, you name it
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.880]  But California is the worst and so now you just don't get your guns or hey, there's been a flood in Katrina
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.880]  We're gonna go to the rich houses and tear down the doors and rob the gun safes. Yeah any excuse to come after our guns and
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.560]  This is the whole extra judicial move to do it
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:35.920]  So here's the report from info wars nightly news last night with David Knight breaking it down, but please
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:42.200]  I'm gonna tweet this out right now. We're playing it. Please get gun confiscation begins in California
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:48.160]  Please get this video and article out to everyone, you know, so they're aware of what's happening here
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.880]  It is this morning NPR carried a gung-ho report on gun confiscation in California
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.800]  They accompanied a gang of government employees as they went about confiscating guns as they put it one by one
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.800]  We're riding in a caravan of four unmarked trucks through the bedroom communities of the San Francisco East Bay
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:11.520]  The trucks carry nine state agents wearing bulletproof vests and armed with 40 caliber Glock pistols and tasers
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:17.200]  They'll spend the next six hours looking for illegal guns. Well, isn't that exciting and fun?
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.320]  But one thing that was missing from the NPR report was the constitutional perspective
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:26.200]  Also missing was what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.160]  We have someone Joe Mendez who had this happen to him in California
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:35.760]  And he gives a perspective of what it feels like to have your constitutional rights violated immediately
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:42.560]  I got two M16 machine gun rifles within five inches from my face on both sides
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.840]  One cop came up with his gun in my face and the other one proceeded to put my hands behind my back
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.520]  Conducted a raid on my house and placed me under arrest
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:02.400]  For the sole purpose of owning and possessing assault rifles
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880]  Which were legal to own
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.280]  They illegally came
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.480]  About 14 agents deep and they lured me out of my house
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:20.760]  They concocted a story and they told my wife in the morning when she woke up a phony CHP car shows up and tells my wife
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.120]  Hey, your car was involved in a hidden run last night
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:30.000]  We're taking a report and who are these people that NPR is so excited about having their guns confiscated
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.160]  His team will visit the homes of 11 people who are considered armed and prohibited persons people on the so-called
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:42.960]  Abs list they are all people who at one time purchased firearms legally armed and prohibited persons
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.360]  Armed and prohibited persons
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:51.640]  APPs they've even got an acronym for it. These assault rifles were purchased in the 1980s
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.520]  And they are fabricated from 1984 and
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.640]  Nineteen late 1960s to 70s
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:03.080]  These are people who purchased firearms legally but now California has decided that they've lost a right to own a gun
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.280]  Well, what does it take to lose your right in California a felony conviction?
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.320]  Well, there's a lot of felonies on the books even things like releasing balloons on a beach can be a felony
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:17.000]  You could have a complaint and a domestic dispute or even a minor misdemeanor conviction
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.240]  Well to paraphrase Pastor Martin Nemoller first they came for the people with nonviolent felony convictions
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.320]  Then they came for the people with misdemeanor convictions
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.680]  NPR is proud of the fact that California is cross-checking what they call quote an extensive
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.560]  Constantly updated database the NRA initially supported this law
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:40.440]  But now even they are opposing it for instance if you were in a fight and you admit to being in the fight
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:45.800]  You can lose your right to own guns and find yourself being SWAT team to confiscate your guns
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.840]  And what does this tell us about the government's priorities a couple of months before?
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.200]  There was a guy who was renting here who we couldn't get rid of he was cooking meth
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.840]  Actually cooking drugs illegal drugs in his apartment here
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:08.760]  We called the Citrus Heights Police Department and the police said even if he had all of the drugs laid out on the table
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.680]  And we caught him doing it there
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.960]  We couldn't do anything about it because there's no budget to press arrest on drugs
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:23.140]  Governor Jerry Brown is expanding this program hiring 36 agents at a cost of 24 million dollars. That's about
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:27.180]  $670,000. All right, let's stop right there. Why does the government ignore crime?
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:32.820]  The full report is up on infowars.com and prismplanted.com. Please get it and
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.980]  Absolutely, they're now just showing up because people buy a thousand rounds of ammo and SWAT teaming
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:41.400]  I'm saying that was suspicious and in California. They're now taking guns
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:48.980]  Interpreting anything basically semi-auto that has a certain type of stock. They're now saying it's illegal retroactively
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:52.580]  Well, without even having a law as Mr. Mendez pointed out
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:20:00.020]  They are coming for our guns folks and they're using things like this to prime the pump and get us used to the gun confiscation teams
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:04.820]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger author of the best-selling book cancer step outside the box

[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:16.620]  12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:24.740]  Back weeknight 7 o'clock central with info wars nightly news. Then of course, there's the weekend radio broadcast on Sunday live
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:30.940]  4 to 6 p.m. Central standard time. Thank you so much for joining us. Now. Here's some of the news out there Obama's brother
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:37.380]  Link to Muslim Brotherhood doctors are of course the world that daily report says Maliki
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540]  Directs radical Islamic
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.540]  movements investments
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:50.380]  Well, actually the prime minister of Kenya, who's his cousin Odinga who Obama's US senator
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:55.620]  Helped them create that position when he lost the election said we'll just have riots and they'll create a position for you
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:01.820]  Odinga is the Muslim leader there. That's targeted Christians in attacks. I mean this this and
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:09.580]  You know the media is like, oh, you know, look at what world that daily saying it's not even a claim. I mean, it's true
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:17.340]  That's that's who's taken over Kenya is the Muslim Brotherhood and folks, you know, I'm not some anti Muslim guy
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:22.300]  That just says Muslims are inherently evil. There are enemy the globalist want a clash of civilizations here
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:31.020]  My issue is is that the Muslim Brotherhood has been particularly radicalized and it's being used to take over
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:39.220]  Moderate countries that have not been enemies of this nation and it's very immoral to put them in charge and and and so of course
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.780]  Of course his brother is involved with the Muslim Brotherhood and of course he gives evidence
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.900]  I mean, I covered that in the Obama deception
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:53.660]  Five years ago about Odinga. I mean Odinga his cousin really about like his uncle
[01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:57.060]  I mean, they're like best buddies. Odinga is a criminal
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:02.620]  Odinga organized Muslims attacking Christians. So the so that instead of Kenya burning they would give him a
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.220]  Position in the government. This is what Obama does
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:12.620]  And yes, he went to a madrasa in Indonesia. Yes, he's been registered as a Muslim
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:18.420]  But that's all part of the how he's everything. He's a Christian. He's a CIA. He's an organizer
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.260]  He's a Muslim know what he is. He's a devilish person
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:24.860]  He's got any face. He needs to wear a mask
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.460]  He's got any face. He needs to wear folks
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:32.980]  He can go speak in Arabic and freak the Muslims out that he speaks in it perfectly
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:39.460]  With the inflections in them when he spoke in Cairo and other places their mouths are hanging open
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:44.900]  When he says you know, my faith is your faith and the media goes, oh, that's a conspiracy theory to say
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.060]  He says he's a Muslim. I can play the clips where he says in Arabic
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.780]  My you know, I grew up with your faith your faith is my faith
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:55.900]  I mean that that's he he says he's a Muslim president and
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:01.300]  Then it's like all the racists are saying he's a Muslim racist. It's a religion
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.900]  He's not a Muslim. I wish he was a Muslim. We would know what he is
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:09.300]  I mean, he technically is a Muslim president, but he's not a Muslim folks
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.980]  Said I take your calls. It's just it's just and then I got articles about another family
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980]  I can't believe CNN actually covers it
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.260]  Iowa husband shoots kills escaped inmate who held him and his wife hostage
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:26.860]  He was tying them up and stuff, but they got to a gun and killed him. I can't believe that's actually in CNN
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.360]  Okay, good job
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.540]  CNN
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.540]  Good job CIA
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:38.420]  CIA news network. Let's talk to Mike in Texas. You're on the air sir. Welcome
[01:27:39.340 --> 01:27:45.180]  Hello, Alex. Um, I was calling about something that happened at the tail end of your show yesterday
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.340]  You were talking about China
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:52.340]  I'm buying up all the world's food. Oh, yes, they are one of the biggest buyers of food in the world
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:54.340]  They're buying up a lot of US food. Yeah
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.980]  Yeah, oh, I recently wrote a book called focus on the horizon that we
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.860]  Talking there about an interview I had with a man by the name of Lester Brown
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:06.460]  I'm very familiar with Lester Brown head of the World Watch Institute that tell us about and
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500]  well, basically Lester Brown is
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:17.780]  is running to the World Watch Institute and the Earth Policy Institute and he's backed by the rocket dollars and
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:22.420]  In 1995 he said point blank in about 20 years
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:29.020]  Give or take a little bit China's going to be an economic titan and he described how they're going to start buying up
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.580]  All of the world's food because they're going to have the wealth to do it
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:37.140]  And it's a situation very similar to the Irish potato family
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:43.500]  Most people don't know this but in the Irish potato famine Ireland was producing about twice as much food as it took to feed the entire country
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.940]  But they exported it all to England in
[01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:51.640]  1847 4,000 ships left Ireland carrying food to England while people were starving
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:58.780]  Absolutely, absolutely, and then they're putting in regulations to make it impossible for small farmers to operate
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:03.380]  But big agris exempt. That's why you beat them by supporting the farmers markets
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:09.220]  That's why you beat them by at least getting partially off the grid. I don't care if you start out by a tiny solar panel
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.900]  You know powering your refrigerator you start by buying local as much as you can
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:20.300]  That will absolutely that's why they SWAT teamed a small sustainable farm in Arlington
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:26.820]  And now we've interviewed the guy and it's in the news where the SWAT team saying it's illegal to grow stuff in Arlington
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.100]  And then the police were there and they gave them like tickets for an inspection sticker out or something
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:38.460]  I mean, it's incredible. So yes, I'm glad you brought that up Mike. Very interesting. Send us a copy of your book
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:42.220]  Okay, Chris Jordan a John

[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:30.360]  Yeah, my job is pretty easy really I really study things I try to figure out what the truth is
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:34.960]  And then I do my best to present it to people. That's all I do
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:43.360]  And I just try to be as honest as I can with myself about things and not lie to myself
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:48.160]  About what I see unfolding that that's what I'm attempting to do. We're going to go back
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:51.520]  To your phone calls here in a moment and then sergeant
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.840]  Joe Beggs is going to be popping in with the latest developments in the sad
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:05.760]  Tragic soap opera that is the death of Michael Hastings and again we've been continually following this because this will affect
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.560]  Not just journalists in this country
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.840]  But the the first amendment that is the greatest offense of human liberty
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:24.080]  And what marks the decline of a country into despotism more than anything is attacks on the press and no one denies
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:31.680]  That Obama is is not persecuting the press like no president in modern u.s. History
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:38.480]  You've got to go back to Abraham Lincoln who they romanticize constantly and again. I don't romanticize the south or the north
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.880]  I know that it was British intelligence on record manipulating both sides against each other. That's also frustrating about history
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.680]  It's not oh, so you're a John you're a you're a red or oh, you're a northerner
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:58.400]  And it's just all a big tragedy all a big manipulation attempt to break up the country and people go. Oh wait now. You're for Lincoln. No Lincoln
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.080]  Lincoln was very weird. I mean that's another issue. See I'm already digressing
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.120]  See he has a problem to know what's happening currently you've got to understand
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.440]  What happened in the past and then that's so not even complex but so big history so big
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.840]  that
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.120]  To look at Lincoln. He was a very strange person
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:25.520]  And it's really ambiguous whether he was bad or good
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.600]  But there's no doubt he did a lot of anti-american anti-freedom stuff and the things he got through
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:35.440]  Is now what has allowed the globalist to come in and take over the federal government
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:42.880]  Because once the federal government is dominant and unconstitutional and tyrannical that whoever hijacks it is the boss
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:49.840]  So we got foreign corporations that run the federal government now on record. They are now the occupiers of this country
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.880]  And they can do anything they want if we let them. I mean so much of our problems
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.480]  So many of our problems rest with the fact that there's no special interest for individuals
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.880]  There's no special interest for common sense. There's no there's no lobby for that
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.400]  We've got an NRA that because people got on their butt
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:15.600]  Has been actually defending the second amendment, you know, even just five years ago. They weren't and I was all over them
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.440]  And you know just promoting gunners of America and Jews the preservation of firearms ownership and a few other
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080]  Independent real groups that did a great job
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.880]  But they have been able to force thing in our a
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:33.040]  By the way, I was instrumental behind the scenes. I'm not bragging. I was telling you I
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.600]  told Larry Pratt
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.920]  And had long conversations with him saying you've got to come out against the NRA. You've got
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.200]  To make them get hardcore. We're gonna lose this
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:48.400]  And uh, you know, you could also fundraise on the fact that you're the real gun group, which they were already doing
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.000]  But I said, I know you're a classy guy, but the second amendment comes first
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:58.160]  And I I was instrumental. I'm not bragging. I'm telling you that's kind of stuff I do behind the scenes saying, you know, you need to attack them
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.160]  Going back about six seven years ago. And so I got him on he would attack them
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.160]  How they were set up by the northern army after the civil war
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:10.320]  To to train people because the north didn't have firearms training like the south
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.720]  Now it's always been a federal group how they supported the 68 gun control act
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.440]  Uh, how they've sold out over and over again
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.640]  And and you you've heard people like Ted Nugent on the board come out and basically admit
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:28.240]  They've gotten more hardcore and thank gun owners for getting their their members to go after NRA
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.040]  I mean, we need to
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.800]  Nudge
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.800]  groups into doing the right thing
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:41.360]  Just like the the communists go around bullying everybody into authoritarianism. We need to
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.400]  To pressure organizations that could be vehicles of liberty
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.280]  into doing the right thing
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.480]  We need to get aggressive folks. I mean, that's not even aggressive
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.800]  And and and so now the NRA is really doing a great job
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  Because we made them do it
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.280]  And I'm not taking sole credit for that
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.360]  I've there've been discussions inside the board of directors of gunners of america. It was about five six years ago
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.360]  About doing that and I and I and I just said we'll go have another meeting
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.880]  You know, you need to do this right now larry and I said I want you to come back on he came back on and did shows
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.320]  About the real history of the NRA. I mean, that's that's how you get stuff done
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.160]  We're not going to get stuff done being nice here ladies and gentlemen
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:35.200]  We're not going to get stuff done playing patty cake with the new world order and and compromising they never compromise with us

[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.000]  with
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Staff sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:05.760]  Who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and had the famous war correspondent reporter Michael Hastings embedded with him?
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.360]  Off and on for quite a long time. They became good friends
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  The feds visited Michael
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.960]  Hastings a day before that's now been admitted the feds have now admitted and they had a file on him and they
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.520]  They lied about that
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.680]  Just a recap here
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.080]  His car blew up a few months ago
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.360]  His wife was the spokesperson for the
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:30.880]  National Security Council
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.160]  That's the very top of the pyramid the very top of the pyramid of the new world order. That's as high level as it gets in government
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:41.040]  Now there's some tentacles that go into it that are even higher from the big combines, but that's the group actually
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.920]  You know running the whole system for the globalist
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:49.600]  The nukes the weapons the control systems the hit teams. I mean that's central command
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.480]  That is the top of the pyramid and she worked there very interesting point. I'll just throw that out there
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:58.000]  He said I've got the big story. They're coming after me. They're going to rate it
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.960]  Uh, he said I've got the big story. They're coming after me. They're going to rate us
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:06.160]  I'm going off the radar boom car blows up witnesses then say we saw the car blow up the middle of the road
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.800]  That's now been confirmed engine blows out the other direction. That doesn't happen hitting a tree
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:18.880]  All that said they now released the coroner's report to the la times. It's up on info wars.com right now
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.960]  and
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.120]  They say oh he had methamphetamine in him. He had uh dmt in him
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.680]  That's a hallucinogen the last five minutes folks
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.520]  Uh, he he had marijuana in him. Well, there's hundreds of things that will give you a false positive for methamphetamine
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.240]  And his family's come out. We have an article here saying he didn't use methamphetamine. That's not true
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  So my whole point is this looks very very very suspicious
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:50.000]  And they they they usually say you're on drugs when you die mysteriously. I've always said that if they kill me
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.000]  They'll pull something like that. I don't use illegal drugs folks. Just have that on record
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:01.360]  Uh, so I wanted to just briefly get his friend staff sergeant bigs on because he's the only guy when he got to email
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.040]  Saying the feds are after me. No, everybody else got that the family the friends. They were all scared to release it
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.960]  And he's the guy that said no friends said the feds visited him
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.920]  You know the young turks knew that didn't report it now that's come out
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:18.720]  So this thing stinks to high heaven. I want to believe he was on drugs
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.600]  And it was a regular car wreck because I want to believe they didn't kill him
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.360]  But my gut tells me this just gets worse and worse
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.040]  And staff sergeant bigs. Thanks for popping in with us. There's a lot of facets to this that smell
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.920]  What's your take on it?
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.400]  Yeah
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.280]  Just a lot of these things that keep showed up in the toxicology report
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.680]  I mean if it had no effect on the accident or why are they named and they're just like running off and naming all this different stuff
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:52.480]  But then they go and say well, well, there's nothing wrong
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.400]  You know, there's they're saying that he was on mushrooms apparently because that's what DMT is
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.200]  It's like a psilocybin
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.600]  There's just all kinds of random stuff in the methamphetamine. I mean, I mean he was known to be on the Ritalin
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.600]  So I don't know if that's a contributing factor
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.240]  There's something that show positive any test
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.680]  Well, yeah, that's the thing they put hundreds of millions of people worldwide on these drugs and now
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.040]  Uh, oh, that's right. He was a Ritalin from childhood
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:23.520]  Then the people get basically used to it to to operate and then now that's like an excuse for why his car blew up
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.520]  It was just very strange
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:31.920]  Yeah, I mean, well, I'm looking over the the police report right now and it's saying that, you know
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:41.040]  Because of you know striking the tree and it was instantaneous stuff. I mean I just
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.040]  If you look at the tree you can tell this doesn't it doesn't add up
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:49.360]  Well, what about them saying that he was charred beyond recognitions they had to cremate him
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.240]  But now the autopsy says they got fingerprints and that wasn't true
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.200]  Yeah, I know it's just crazy
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.600]  Well, I mean stories are always going to change in things but I mean the fact is if I ever say I'm going off the radar
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.440]  They're coming after me boom
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.720]  I mean, obviously something smells here and the fact that they ridicule anybody that questions
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:10.720]  I think that's a big red flag right there
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.840]  Yeah, there there's a lot of people out there that are questioning everybody who's questioning the whole incident itself
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.280]  A lot of the people I know that are have the same viewpoints as I do about what happened
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.680]  They're all being ridiculed and you know, everyone just wants to throw that conspiracy tag on there
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:32.960]  When there's just so many questions that are answered and so many things don't add up. I mean you've got to be
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.760]  Mental to not think that there's something more than just an accident
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.520]  Well, I mean, I remember
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.880]  You know saying the NSA spying on you with keyword systems
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.400]  Reading the EU commission reports congressional reports and people said I was lying or crazy
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.760]  When it was admitted 15 years ago. They were doing this. I mean this this this news isn't breaking
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.840]  I mean, I guess if my wife ever caught me in bed with another woman hypothetically
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:05.680]  I'll just get up and say you're a conspiracy theorist and she'll go there's the woman right there and I'll go no no honey
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:08.080]  No, I mean, I mean, it's incredible
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.560]  Yeah, I mean the report says partially charled remains heavily charred over the head
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.280]  And that's it. Just the rest of that is just
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.160]  You know some fractures and stuff from
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.960]  You know banging around in there, but
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440]  Why was just the face
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:31.280]  heavily charred? Who knows what's really going on?
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.000]  I mean, we could really have theories and say he was really a secret operative and they just put a
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  They just put a
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.960]  cadaver in there and blew it up, you know to
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.640]  Make their their their secret agent go undercover
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:51.520]  And that that's why his wife's not upset, you know, because she's a secret agent herself. I mean she basically is former
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320]  flack for the
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.760]  for the
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.360]  Uh national security council, and of course I'm being hypothetical. I don't believe that
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:05.920]  But but I mean you could say anything at this time because the whole story has been proven that they've been lying to us from day one
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:10.480]  We now know the fbi was investigating him and they said they weren't. What do you make of that?
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  Yeah
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.680]  Because the fbi came out right off the bat and said that they weren't
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.680]  Investigating him at all
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.800]  The one who the fbi was involved until I released email
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.080]  But now uh through some of their uh
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.120]  Their phone calls and uh for sponsors in the email
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:37.520]  They said i'm supposed to be getting all the information that they had on him on september 9th
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:44.960]  Well, listen, I know that you're on your lunch break there at a restaurant joining us via video skips what's breaking up a bit
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.200]  anything else
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.160]  Staff sergeant joe bigs that you'd like to add about this entire this entire saga
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.200]  Oh, I just hope that everybody remembers him as a good man and you know
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:00.080]  I'm going to keep looking into this because I don't think it's an accident
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:05.360]  Yeah, I don't think it's an accident uh either and and I and I think her behavior
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.360]  I mean people call it stepward wife. Just like she just won an academy award
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:13.440]  She's so happy on pierce morgan saying, you know, he died, you know, naturally
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.400]  She thinks when she told you she was going to take down whoever did this at the funeral and thought it was foul play
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:24.080]  I mean, this is like a cloak and dagger movie. I mean, I won't I mean don't you want to believe he just died in a car wreck
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.960]  It's not like we're just saying this because we want to say it all the evidence points towards foul play
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.680]  Of course it does. I mean it would be a lot easier a lot less stressful to
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.000]  Just go ahead and put this to rest and you know remember him for who he was
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.400]  There's so many inconsistencies and things right now. There's just so many
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:48.480]  Things don't add up and if we don't ask questions and we're not doing him justice at all
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.560]  Well, I know a lot of momentum is heating up with investigators looking into this
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.400]  Independent groups. That's why they're getting so nervous. I think this has been added as a smear
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:00.800]  Uh, but you know, we could be wrong
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.480]  But obviously we'll track this as it continues to unfold because it affects not just us individually but the press
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.880]  And a free country as a whole

[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:41.040]  During the break. I was looking at more video and photos of nerve gas children in Damascus
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.840]  over in the Middle East and Syria
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:49.600]  Just children nerve gas right when the un inspectors are there. They've already caught al-qaeda
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.720]  with the west three times staging other smaller events
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.160]  And now you're hearing well, this is probably Syria
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:02.320]  The government we need to we need to bomb them and then turn the whole country over to jihadis
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.400]  and then slaughter all the christians
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:08.160]  and any any jews that happen to be there or any other alawite muslims
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:17.360]  Unbelievable and sometimes I almost wish I was a sociopath and didn't get hurt by photos of dead children
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:22.960]  Or or a dead baby deer in the road or whatever. I mean, I just I guess I'm weak
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:26.640]  That I just have empathy. I'm a bad. I just
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:32.320]  I just it's torture. It's torture to care and then you just watch all this scum
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.560]  Triumph because they don't care about humanity. They think it's cool that they're a bunch of parasites
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.040]  Let's talk to christen mass. Thanks for holding sir. I appreciate it
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.680]  Hey, Alex, uh, I just wanted to make a comment about the interview yesterday with Richardson
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.320]  And I know you're trying to be political because he was fair to you
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.840]  But how can he say with a straight face that the jfk is fascinating the rfk is fascinating in 9 11
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.240]  All happened the way the government says they happen
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:05.520]  You know, he's a smart guy. He must know better than that. Well, you're talking about john Richardson from esquire who was on
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.920]  you know, I genuinely believe that he buys into all that stuff because
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.600]  Uh, talking to him when he was a teenager and in college in the 60s
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:20.640]  And his dad was a famous cia section chief
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:25.760]  His dad told him there are no secrets. Everything ends up coming out. It isn't as complex as you say
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:32.960]  Uh, blah blah blah and his dad was probably compartmentalized. I mean, that's the kind of people even though they're smart that they have
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.840]  uh, who
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.200]  who
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.960]  You know air on the side of caution saying something isn't a conspiracy
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.040]  When when in many cases it is. I mean undoubtedly listen
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.840]  lbj's lawyers gone public. They've released all the documents
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:53.520]  Uh, I've interviewed lbj's mistress who was confirmed to be his mistress
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:57.840]  And and we have it all the way up to lbj. There's obviously groups above that
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.400]  But they met at clint merchants's house
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.800]  And the the night before and nixon was there and they killed him deader than a hammer
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:14.320]  And and so look look john richardson is with the 10 of americans in major polls who think that it was a lone gunman
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.800]  I mean lee harvey oswald was obviously a mcvay set up. He was in the cia. That's been now released
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:27.520]  Just the fact that he was in there. He was at secret youtube bases and then defects to russia and then was allowed to come back
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  I mean, he was a spy
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:33.040]  I mean, it's all on record. I mean, I grew up in dallas folks
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:38.240]  I've I've been on jet airplanes with famous lawyers to the bushes
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:44.560]  When they start going, oh alex, of course, you're right. I grew up next to the rancher that where they help plan kill him
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.960]  That kennedy. I mean, I mean they had deader alive signs in texas. I mean, I'm from dallas folks
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:56.160]  The police all know they killed him the bunch of them were in on it. I mean, it's like an open secret
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.160]  They blew his head off
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:03.200]  And the truth is he made a bunch of texans mad. So the globalists decided to whack him down here
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:05.680]  I mean, that's just that's just what went on
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:09.760]  And and so I hear you but I look the fun is he did a quasi fair piece
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.320]  And so what do I say about that? I mean, what do you think?
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:16.960]  No, I you would be in play to him and being respectful, which is totally understandable
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:21.440]  I'll say it for you. He's a mainstream hack who pushes the agenda of the mainstream
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.400]  And you don't need to say it. I'll say it for you and just sitting here
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:30.160]  I probably wrote down a hundred different things with jfk and 9 11 that are just inconsistencies lies
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.800]  major boonfield parmond x clayshaw
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:39.600]  Guy bannister portagas operation group 40. I mean, there's dozens of things. Oh, absolutely. It's incredible. I don't think he's a hack
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.040]  I think he disagrees with us. You are listening to gcn

[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.600]  I was almost late getting back on air
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:46.400]  Because yes, even turra called me up during the break
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.240]  With some breaking info, but it's off air. I'm going to call him
[02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:57.040]  During this next break and find out what it's about. In fact, I only have three minutes to do that
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.640]  So I want to discover what this is about actually right now. So I'm probably going to play a short news clip
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:06.560]  the gg urneta piece on hastings
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.120]  and
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.680]  Then we'll come back and go to your phone calls
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:14.480]  after I find out
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.840]  What it is ventura wants to talk to me about off air and I'm sure if he wants to chew the fat with me about something news breaking
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.840]  It's important
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.560]  I'm not name dropping. I was trying to eat
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.760]  A energy bar not even an energy bar is like a coconut
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.000]  almond health bar
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.040]  During a one minute break I have to eat like job of the hut because I have such short breaks and then ventura
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.280]  I talked in for like 30 seconds. So now I'm like chomping at the bit to find out exactly what it was
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:46.000]  We're going to go to this gg urneta piece urneta piece and then we're going to come back and go right to your phone calls jordan
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:55.920]  Michael rod and donna your calls are coming up. But right now. Let's go to this piece by gg urneta on the hastings situation
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:02.720]  And we have some breaking news that we just received. We actually have the coroner's report from the michael hastings accident
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.280]  We've acquired it through sergeant joe bigs who's going to be on the show tomorrow with alex
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:13.280]  It'll be an exclusive segment with alex talking about what's inside of this a very extensive report
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:19.680]  But there are a couple things that we've noticed and they have to do with the fact that they're claiming that he may have been using drugs
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.880]  And also the la times has come out with an article
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.680]  Saying that the coroner family linked michael hastings to drug use at the time of death
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:33.680]  Now I want to note that the la times has been claiming that the fbi is also not involved
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.320]  In researching any of this or having anything to do with the michael hastings accident
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:44.480]  But yet sergeant bigs knows that the fbi has material because he's actually going to receive some in september from them
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:49.440]  So we have some conflicting information now in the toxicology part of this report
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:54.480]  It's talking about carboxy thc, which doesn't cause impairment
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.160]  and
[02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:02.480]  He's a regular user of medicinal marijuana for ptsd. That's inside of the report, which you can take a look at later
[02:03:03.040 --> 02:03:04.000]  and
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.600]  The second kind
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.600]  This thc, which is at 12
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:09.760]  If you're a regular user
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.760]  This level of thc
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.680]  Would not impair you
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:15.200]  30
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:22.080]  Is actually the high level and we've actually done a report on people who drove at that level and were able to do that just fine. So
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:27.840]  The only other chemical found in his body was 0.05 micrograms of
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.200]  amphetamine which
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.600]  There's actually a lot of common compounds that can give a false positive for meth
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.680]  Look at all this and go down the list from Advil to anything to b2 vitamin
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  nyquil
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:47.120]  Dymatap
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.080]  I mean look at this list
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:54.800]  Toxic levels for methamphetamines don't even register until 0.1
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:57.520]  So according to this toxicology report
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:05.680]  It's just basically it looks like a character assassination saying that he was on drugs and that there was family intervention on needing rehab
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:08.480]  And it's a real shame
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:13.440]  But today's daily quote our constitution was made for a moral and religious people
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.160]  It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other that's from john adams
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:21.440]  Support the grassroots movement
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:24.480]  Indie filmmaking

[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.440]  It's a compelling film of how the drug war affects the children
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.880]  From a perspective you wouldn't expect
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:39.520]  And we have the director kevin booth that's here with david knight
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:49.520]  So stick around till after the break because it's a great interview
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:04.720]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action

[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.000]  The united states is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:24.640]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of fema cams now being expanded nationwide

[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:07.760]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has had to understand
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:15.680]  The potential of information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to

[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:28.320]  That's right folks into the third hour. I just talked to jessie ventura the last five minutes or so
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:32.000]  I'm gonna call him after the show and I've got more time to see what he wants to
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:34.720]  Do on air of anything?
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:40.720]  But uh, man the stuff that goes on behind the scenes and then people don't ever know if they want to talk about it or not
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:42.720]  I'm like, of course. You got to talk about this
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:47.760]  I just I just he I know jessie. I know he's a good guy a real guy
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:52.000]  And the media always goes. Oh, he's a wrestler. It must be fake or something and then
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.720]  The whole chris kyle thing and and the whole deal with them making that up
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:00.400]  And
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:06.400]  Just just everything that's going on behind the scenes. It was unbelievable and as usual I come on air and can't tell you what it is
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:13.760]  Until he's willing to come on air and talk about it. He's scheduled on the show when he first does his book
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:20.720]  He's here first before he's on that knucklehead pierce morkin show. He's coming on here first
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.680]  When is that the 29th of september?
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:26.240]  Aventura is going to be on with us
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.800]  My whole point is is that he's a good guy. I don't even agree with all of his politics
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:33.360]  But he's a real guy and I really have good friends with the sun and
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:39.840]  Tyrell and and done a lot of work with them and and and I didn't mean to digress off into this stuff. It's just that
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:45.440]  Once you know people good and then you see what the media says about them. It makes it like personal
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:48.800]  Because you know, it's just so made up
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.640]  Uh, and uh, you see people go through
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:59.760]  The anguish of things there. He was at a commencement event loves the navy seals and udt teams so much
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.880]  And uh, cares so much about our veterans getting hurt and killed as wise against those wars
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:07.440]  And then when I called him in mexico
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.840]  To tell him that they'd made that up about him. He said you're joking, right?
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.440]  And I was like, no, I'm sorry. It's it's true
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:22.880]  And he came on my show that day. It was a sunday, you know talked about it. And uh
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.080]  It was almost like when I've told fellow members somebody died before and they're like
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:34.480]  At first, they're shocked and quiet or what and they're they're processing it
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.800]  And of course, it was all of the finally scripted sigh-up by the neo cons
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:42.160]  who don't want him to ever ever be able to run for president
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.880]  and then they said he got
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:47.920]  uh
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:50.880]  Detained and arrested in california going to the airport and he had blonde hair and it was probably hulk hogan
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:54.400]  And they they just keep putting out these false reports
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:11:01.960]  And they just keep putting out these false reports false reports false reports false reports false reports
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:04.320]  It's like the Michelle Malkin thing now. I know better
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.720]  But they all start
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:08.720]  This is back at the DNC
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.720]  Democratic protest at the Mint I went to cover it
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.200]  Michelle Malkin had said I was a liar about Marines throwing that dog off that it was a mechanical dog
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.480]  And then I knew it and then they admitted later was a real dog. It was obviously a real dog
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:25.840]  So I came over to her and she had some guys kind of bumping into me and muscling me
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.840]  So I started you know elbowing them back
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:31.920]  And then there were these people that came with her and left with her in clown outfits
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:35.560]  And the local young Republicans group at the college
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:38.120]  screaming kill Michelle Malkin and
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:43.160]  Then they had media there to run off and put it out on the news wires within an hour and
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:47.020]  Thank God. I was able to get to the hotel
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:53.460]  Get the video up that night and show people that I didn't say it. And let me tell you they were gonna destroy me with that
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:12:00.300]  They had national radio TV. It was on like ABC News NBC CBS hard copy
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:03.660]  extra. Yeah, yeah, there's the clown guys with the clown hats and
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:11.580]  They were like he said kill a woman and they were like it's the end of Alex Jones. He went too far
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:14.020]  You know saying
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:20.820]  Killer and and and you could because you know when the national media has something in one hour Denver post
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:29.020]  Rush Limbaugh had his fill in host on there who writes for the Dallas morning news and he wouldn't retracted even when it came out
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:34.980]  That didn't mean to digress. It just I couldn't imagine though. Someone said I went to a Navy SEAL wake
[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:42.220]  Cuz imagine that's a big intelligence operation. It's a bunch of spies bunch of commando fighter spies like
[02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:49.820]  Model after the SAS special air services in England and you show up. They're like, oh, it's Ventura that anti-war guy
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:53.540]  We're sick of him. He's in movies thinks he's big most of the SEALs love him
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:58.100]  We'll just destroy him. Yeah, just yeah, just just say you beat him up
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.540]  And then there were no witnesses for then it was on the street
[02:13:00.540 --> 02:13:04.500]  It happened and blah blah blah and then he goes and susan
[02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:09.060]  When they go the poor widow, he's being mean to her the insurance company
[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:16.740]  For the book company is gonna pay for it. Ventura has already spent more money than he'll even get by the way on this lawsuit
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:19.780]  Just amazing
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:25.740]  I'm gonna shut up for us anymore. The point is is that I said I go right to your calls and I'm going to go right to your calls
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:31.700]  It's just that now. I realize how dirty tricks work. I have to watch out for them constantly
[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:37.820]  And and even organic groups will do dirty tricks like like you announce you're doing a protest
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:40.460]  Other people get a permit to be there
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:46.420]  You show up with a couple hundred of your listeners and I can go do an event speak to 5,000 if I want you an impromptu protest
[02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:52.340]  You show up at it. This is just an example something goes on here. There are three hours people say you're not welcome here
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:58.220]  Like 10 people out of 300 and so you stop bullhorning and then they wait till you bullhorn when they stop and go
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:03.220]  How dare you be bullhorning? You're an agent here to destroy the Second Amendment
[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:08.060]  You know, it's like America now organically because I don't think those folks were feds
[02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:11.060]  organically know how to
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:14.020]  You know just just make stuff up
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:20.740]  You know, it's like the whole lacrosse team thing or whatever. I mean this is what goes on now
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:26.340]  in this country that this is what our culture has been taught how to do and
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:29.540]  It's disgusting. It's totally and completely disgusting
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:37.900]  It's a culture of frame-ups is what it is and good people have to watch out all the time now that you're not framed
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:45.580]  Because that's what the bad guys do they want to frame you and cast you as the bad guy so they can be the hero
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:53.460]  Instead of just being good people themselves and actually being the hero. Let's go ahead and talk about the bad guys
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:59.500]  People themselves and actually being the hero. Let's go ahead and talk to Jordan in Missouri. You're on the air. Welcome
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:02.860]  Hey, I was I have a quick comment and a quick question
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:08.780]  I just wanted to say that I've seen a Fox News report and they were talking about how you can make three times as much as
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:14.620]  Where you're working at now to sell Obamacare and I just want people that's listening to understand that all you're gonna be doing is contribute
[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:19.660]  To your grandparents or your parents death and it's really sad and I don't think you should do it
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:24.820]  But anyways, my question is my grandma's been on medicine for like 15 to 20 years now
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:29.220]  And they're trying to take her off of it now and put on psychiatric drugs and she won't do it
[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:31.380]  And she's been in and out of the hospital like five times
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:35.020]  She almost died one time and they they're still taking off the medicine
[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:39.740]  I mean, is there anything you anyone can do or you could do like I mean, what can you do about that?
[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:46.500]  I mean, this is eugenics care and now they admit. Oh, there are death panels the bioethics boards and
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:54.340]  And it's what dr. Blalock said they're going to give you a cane instead of eye surgery a cane instead of hip surgery a cane instead of knee surgery
[02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:56.660]  that's your health care and
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:01.940]  They're going to bankrupt the whole system on purpose and federalize it
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:07.420]  So they have control so big banks make private profits off of it for doing nothing basically
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:12.740]  And you'll have a two-tier health system, you know, really wealthy people will still be able to go get good care
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:17.300]  But for the general public, there's not going to be good doctors good access
[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:24.540]  Just remember people are already seeing their premiums go up 50 something percent. It's gonna double by a year and a half from now
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:26.740]  2015 that's all official
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:29.100]  Doesn't cover pre-existing conditions and yeah
[02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:36.540]  All the troops I know who have bad knees or have kidneys going out from DU. That's where precipitate sound
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:43.980]  They the sergeant bigs will tell you everybody. He knows they go here. Just just take this Louvox take this or here's pain pills
[02:16:43.980 --> 02:16:49.460]  And then they call you in and go you're you're on pain pills. You're an addict a year later
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:52.060]  We're gonna we're gonna declare you mentally unstable
[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:54.860]  Because you're on a Percocet. I
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:57.540]  Mean, that's what they do. You know, you're in a car
[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:01.060]  They go here's pain pills and then you're on them for a month because you're in pain all sudden
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:07.860]  I need more of those. I'm number one my back hurts and I'm addicted. I know I need surgery. No, you don't you don't get the pills either I
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:11.460]  Mean it is just folks
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:17.580]  It's an evil system being evil is easy being evil and corrupt and wrecking things and screwing things over is easy
[02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:20.580]  That's what evil is is the triumph of the thug
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:28.980]  That's what the Herzog produced film the act of killings about and it was like entering hell for two hours to watch this movie
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:34.440]  And I know people that are into evil, you know, go. Oh, well, you're shocked by the
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:39.980]  Killing so I'm shocked by how weak the evil people are and how narcissistic and how
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:47.380]  Demonically childlike they are and how they're toddling around and now there's like gangs of them in their stupid youth core uniforms
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:53.380]  And I see our government setting up the very same thing and and I see the cops acting like Indonesian police
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:58.700]  I mean, it's like, oh my gosh, I just think of how we've degenerated in the 18 years
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:01.940]  I've been on air and then I think about your grandmother
[02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:06.220]  You know Bill Gates goes if we have one old lady and we don't give her care
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:13.220]  We can we don't help that patient. We can hire 10 teachers and the teachers are all going. Oh, oh the idea
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:18.860]  I kill an old lady. I get money. No, you don't you build a better economy and we're complex economy better care
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:21.700]  Everybody gets risen up. It's what you build
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:28.860]  Money's all just fiat, but they use fiat money to engineer it where then there's artificial scarcity in the goods
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:32.140]  But I'm sorry for your grandmother
[02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:36.060]  There's a lot of things like more water clean water
[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:42.540]  Get her on things like beyond Tangierine too. It's just does unbelievable stuff. A lot of times people can have a
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:47.300]  Deficiency or something that's triggering a lot of stuff. It's not a silver bullet, but it's close
[02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:53.420]  Info worse health calm, but mainly just purified water sunshine
[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:55.900]  love
[02:18:55.900 --> 02:18:59.620]  Going over to her house every couple days and bringing her a little snack and telling her
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:06.500]  Telling her you love her. I think that'll that'll help her probably even more than even even the vitamins and minerals and I mean
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.220]  Is she a religious woman? Do you ever pray with her?
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:12.780]  Yeah, she is she used to go to church and everything
[02:19:12.780 --> 02:19:17.660]  She just she ain't been doing well recently because they've been trying to take her off the medicine and I just want to tell
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:21.100]  The elite and all of them I will not contribute. I'm young and I will not contribute to this
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:25.900]  And I will not go along with this and kill my grandparents and my parents and whoever does it is sick
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:30.140]  And that's all I got to say about that front. I mean it's sick. No, it is. I mean
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:40.140]  It's gonna get worse too, I appreciate you calling in you know, I mean, thank you. God bless. Listen. I know I mean, it's bad
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:44.500]  Everybody I know now that's on insurance plans and stuff
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:46.980]  They're telling them, you know, you don't need a knee surgery
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:52.660]  Let that get a little bit worse for me before we do that. You know, but my insurance covers it. Well, we got new rules
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:55.420]  That's not that's not essential. Okay

[02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:48.860]  Hey, Alex. Thank you for taking my call man. Hey, I just want to commend you and all your staff and the work you're doing
[02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:52.860]  I'll tell you what if it wasn't for you, we'd probably all be sitting in FEMA camps now
[02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:58.860]  But anyway, I had a quote here. I wanted to run by you real quick that I think fits you perfectly
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:03.860]  I know you've been labeled as a raving lunatic many times, but let me read this to you
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:10.860]  This was a quote by Destin James and it says, a truce initial commotion is directly proportional to how deeply the lie was believed
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:20.860]  And when a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truce will be utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic
[02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:25.860]  So when you get labeled as a raving lunatic, I look at that as a badge of honor for you
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:30.860]  You know, absolutely. I've seen that quote before. Who said that again?
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:42.860]  That was Destin James. I mean, I think that's a pen name, but it was Destin James, D-R-E-S-D-E-N-J-A-M-E-S
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:48.860]  Well, look, I mean, I am a bit eccentric and I do yell and scream and get upset sometimes when I see like yesterday
[02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:54.860]  Peaceful people in Missouri at an impeachment Obama rally on an overpass
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:26:05.860]  Not impeding traffic, not doing anything wrong, and the state police all show up, block the road, impede traffic, run up like they've, you know, found a den of child molesters or something
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:11.860]  And start choking people. I mean, it's what you see in third world countries
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:17.860]  And it's so anti-freedom, anti-American that I start yelling about it
[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:23.860]  And I'll be frank with folks, I wish sometimes I wouldn't get upset because then it saps my energy later when I've got work to do
[02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:28.860]  But everybody's been being calm about all this stuff and it's only getting worse
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:32.860]  What do you think we need to do, Rod, to turn this country around?
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:38.860]  Well, you know, the first thing obviously it takes, you know, for the people to start waking up
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:43.860]  And I do believe that not necessarily in this part of the world yet, but I know in other parts of the world
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:47.860]  The people are starting to get a higher consciousness and they are starting to wake up
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:51.860]  And I do believe positively that things are going to turn
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:59.860]  And one thing that these drones, as I call them, these Nazi drones with guns and badges that run around plundering people and doing the things they do
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:05.860]  One thing that they don't understand, unfortunately, is when everything really hits the fan
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:12.860]  The thing is, these poor suckers and their families are going to be targeted first because like the saying goes
[02:27:12.860 --> 02:27:23.860]  Their puppet masters know beyond a shadow of a doubt that anybody that would turn their back on the Constitution completely override their oaths and not pay attention
[02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:30.860]  They are traitors and they can't be trusted, so the next thing in line will be these clowns that have already done their dirty work for them
[02:27:30.860 --> 02:27:39.860]  And once that turns around, they will go after them because obviously if they've done what they've done, they certainly can't be trusted to keep running with their so-called New World Order
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:42.860]  No, that's it, that's it, that's a great point, go ahead
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:48.860]  I keep telling people that change is coming and it certainly ain't going to be coming from the district criminals
[02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:50.860]  Absolutely, I appreciate you calling in
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:56.860]  And then the government's gearing up for war with us and saying people that promote basic liberty are the terrorists
[02:27:56.860 --> 02:27:59.860]  And I guess they think they're going to beat us and just take over
[02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:07.860]  And again, I want to be clear, most police I actually run into, because it's the truth, are awake and don't like what's going on
[02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:12.860]  But it doesn't matter, they can always find people that will follow unconstitutional orders
[02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:22.860]  And this country is based on people supporting the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:30.860]  And when you see the police dressed up like military people, they're not peace officers, they're to uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:38.860]  You know, that's their oath, they're there to enforce whatever they're told and however they can twist the law for the establishment
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:45.860]  An establishment that absolutely hates their guts, an establishment that's totally ruthless and dangerous
[02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:51.860]  So I really just feel sorry for them in the final equation because they're destroying their future along with ours as well
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:59.860]  But we have allowed this to happen, okay, I mean if we move against this politically and really get upset, things will change
[02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:07.860]  We have let government act like it's our boss, we have let government turn things around, we have let criminal, foreign interest
[02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:15.860]  Come into this country and take it over and convert us over to an authoritarian system like they've done all over the world
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:20.860]  The globalists, you notice if you look at other countries, they all have the same systems going in right now
[02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:25.860]  The same high-tech control grid because it's all designed by the globalists on record
[02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:34.860]  Donna, Rashid, Right to Bear Arms, Michael, Lucas and others, your calls are straight ahead, 800-259-9231
[02:29:34.860 --> 02:29:41.860]  I gave it out like an hour ago, it's good to give the number out sometimes, 800-259-9231
[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:45.860]  I'm gonna come back and take five, six more calls, then I'm gonna hit a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet
[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:49.860]  And then back into your calls on this Wednesday edition
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:56.860]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[02:32:59.860 --> 02:33:17.860]  Music
[02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:22.860]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God
[02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:25.860]  It's Alex Jones
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:34.860]  Music
[02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:38.860]  By the way, the Humane Society questions the new White House puppy
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:43.860]  Why not a rescue dog? Why is it a standard poodle?
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:52.860]  Well, I want to know why they helicopter the dog for millions of dollars around River Obama goes on its own aircraft
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:57.860]  On its own helicopter, its own jet, while Obama goes to Africa and says you can't have air conditioning
[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:00.860]  It's bad for the earth, you can't have a car
[02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:09.860]  Post-industrial world, you're going to be a surf, but I'm going to live in the Elysium, you know, Pelinar fields of the gods
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:12.860]  That's basically what they're saying up on Mount Olympus
[02:34:12.860 --> 02:34:16.860]  And you know, I didn't cover this two days ago, I should have covered it
[02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:20.860]  It's an example of countless articles I don't cover that are important
[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:26.860]  Because they're a distraction, but if you decode the distraction, they're important at the same time
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:37.860]  And that is Bill Clinton's foundation in the last, what was it, five years, spending 50 million dollars of charity money
[02:34:37.860 --> 02:34:42.860]  Was it 50 or five? Pull it up, I think it was 50, I'm going from memory two days ago
[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:45.860]  Pull up Bill Clinton's foundation, 50 million on travel
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:50.860]  I know it is, but I just want to double check what's not in front of me, I've got to be neurotic about that because sometimes I get stuff wrong
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:54.860]  And people are like, my gosh, that's like 20-something percent of the money you raised
[02:34:54.860 --> 02:34:59.860]  Yeah, there it is, Bill Clinton's foundation reportedly racks up 50 million in travel cost
[02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:04.860]  And that's what you're paying for is the most expensive 50 million dollar jets
[02:35:04.860 --> 02:35:10.860]  Because that's what it costs a year to run those things, millions, flying him and his family all over the world
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:16.860]  So he can go give speeches and get paid a million dollars by the Saudi Arabians or the Japanese
[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:20.860]  Which are delayed kickbacks for deals he did with them
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:28.860]  And the Communist Chinese and the rest of it, and of course, I mean, when he and George Bush Sr. get up there with that stupid foundation
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:34.860]  Every time there's a disaster and go, hi, me and Bill are here and give us money, it's being spent by them
[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:46.860]  United Way, groups like the Red Cross, almost all the money gets spent on their jets and their helicopters
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:52.860]  And their salaries and their mansions and their security forces and their limos
[02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:57.860]  Because see, you may have the head of one of those charities only making a few million a year, only a few million a year
[02:35:57.860 --> 02:36:05.860]  But the houses, the foundation owns and the helicopters and the jets and the hotels, their whole life is paid for by that
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:11.860]  And they're living the equivalent of what people make in 10, 30, 40, 50 million dollars a year live like
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:18.860]  So instead, as people learn about charities being a fraud, charity giving is going way down in this global depression
[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:25.860]  Instead of doing research and finding out about local charities and things like Salvation Army
[02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:34.860]  They're not perfect, but over 95% of the money in international audits goes to actually feeding and clothing and giving homeless people places
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:41.860]  And trying to get them out of trouble with the gospel, which even if you don't believe in God, statistically is the more effective than drugs
[02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:44.860]  Using drugs to get people off drugs
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:46.860]  Here, you're on heroin, here's methadone
[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:55.860]  And, you know, I've had family that, you know, growing up that gave up jobs, making a lot of money and everything to go work for the Salvation Army
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:58.860]  And they're very fulfilled happy people, by the way
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:01.860]  And I'm not, it's not an ad for the Salvation Army, they're not sponsors
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:06.860]  The point is, is that there's real things out there, Meals on Wheels has always been good
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:12.860]  The only problem is, is that they're trying to turn them into a Tattletale crew for social workers now
[02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:16.860]  You know, there's just a lot of stuff going on out there
[02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:24.860]  And so what I'm trying to get across to people is that, is that Bill Clinton is a disgusting creature
[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:29.860]  And he, with Al Gore and Ken Lay, created the carbon tax deal
[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:32.860]  And it's all a big joke to them, okay?
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:36.860]  I mean, he is a disgusting, kleptocratic, lying criminal
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:42.860]  Who sits up there as a con man and goes, oh, how you doing? I'm your friend, you know?
[02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:46.860]  I love you, Arlam, I love black people
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:49.860]  I'm an Obama Servi, it's liberal
[02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:52.860]  Obama's a great guy, Hillary, Hillary
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:55.860]  I mean, and I know we all know how bad they are
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:38:01.860]  But look, the globalists are stealing 85 billion a month
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:05.860]  85 billion just in QE3 of our money
[02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:10.860]  And then loaning it back to us and are shutting everything down in their tax exempt
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:15.860]  And the public can't get their mind around that, but they can get their mind around
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:22.860]  The White House dog, now they've got two of them being flown around on its own private helicopter
[02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:28.860]  Because you see, see, the president can't, I mean, even George W. Bush would just have the dogs with him on the helicopter
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:34.860]  No, no, no, no, no, they're only props, you know, Obama doesn't really like the dog from what I've read
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:38.860]  I mean, it's totally fake, I mean, he may not be a true Muslim, but he did grow up Muslim countries
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:42.860]  Where dogs are unclear, so you just got to have the dog for photo op
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:46.860]  And every time I turn on the news, it's like, what the dog did, or is it the dog knee?
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:53.860]  The dog is nice, and look, Rupert Murdoch is eating an ice cream cone and so is Warren Buffett
[02:38:53.860 --> 02:38:57.860]  Type in Warren Buffett's name in like half the photos on Google images or him in ice cream cone
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:03.860]  Because he does it because I'm non-threatening, I get most of the bailout money, tens of billions of your money
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:08.860]  You know, I raise taxes on middle class to give me the money, it's for the poor, and it's like ABC News
[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:14.860]  Warren Buffett's so nice, he wants to raise taxes on the middle class and enrich people because he doesn't pay enough
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:20.860]  And then underwritten on this week of ABC News, it's the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that he's part of
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:29.860]  It's paid newscast, paid newscast by him to tell you how great he is swindling you and your family
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:38.860]  This is Pirate Archer, watching that con man slime bag, bag of pus, sit there and suck everybody dry
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:49.860]  Oh, I just can't handle it anymore, just look at that rat, just look at that disgusting, just a bucket of degeneracy
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:55.860]  And evil and parasitic slop in our face how good he is
[02:39:55.860 --> 02:40:00.860]  He has total disdain for the public, he funds eugenics worldwide
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:05.860]  And the worst thing about their eugenics is they're not just targeting the dumb down, you know, whatever people that have no future
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:08.860]  I think that's bad enough, you should lift them up
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:13.860]  No, they're sterilizing them, they're killing them, but they're targeting the smartest people in their programs
[02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:17.860]  And making sure the West doesn't even reproduce
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:20.860]  Whether it's Japan or the United States
[02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:25.860]  You know, first world industrialized avant-garde cutting edge, let's get rid of that
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:28.860]  Because the criminals have an instinct to run everybody in the gut
[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:32.860]  Run everybody down into the gutter so they can squat on us easier
[02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:34.860]  Because they hate you and your family
[02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:39.860]  Ugh, see I said I don't want to get angry and then I just look at Bill Clinton's ugly face
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:42.860]  And I look at the ugly face of Rupert Murdoch
[02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:47.860]  And I think about Bill Gates and his sniveling wife and all these people up there
[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:52.860]  Maybe we deserve it, hey we let them rob us, we let them do all this to us, okay fine
[02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:56.860]  Shut up there every time there's a tornado or hurricane, give money to Bill Clinton
[02:40:56.860 --> 02:41:02.860]  So this guy who's already worth hundreds of millions from robbing everybody
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:08.860]  Can have you pay, have you pay for his jets
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:14.860]  And incidentally all he's got to do is shake somebody's hand or cut a ribbon or write a letter
[02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:18.860]  On letterhead or have a five minute corporate meeting when he flies somewhere
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:23.860]  And then it becomes foundation business where he's flying, I mean it's just unbelievable
[02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:32.860]  It's unbelievable, meanwhile the patriot liberty movement needs to get behind real media

[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:40.860]  Okay, enough of that, let's go back to your phone calls
[02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:46.860]  As promised, Donna in New Mexico, you're on the year, welcome
[02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:48.860]  Hi, thanks for taking my call Alex
[02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:54.860]  I wanted to speak about Syria, specifically I want to go back in time to the Bush Cheney era
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:59.860]  When there was a lot of discussion going on, especially in alternative media
[02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:02.860]  About the project for the new American Century
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:06.860]  And I think it's really important to pay attention to that because that white paper
[02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:10.860]  That neocon policy is still being implemented today
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:15.860]  And what's happening in Syria, what's happening in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc
[02:44:15.860 --> 02:44:18.860]  Basically all goes right back to that paper
[02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:22.860]  And even though we have Obama now, which is neoliberalism versus neoconism
[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:26.860]  Which I think are equal, what in the same
[02:44:26.860 --> 02:44:28.860]  The prize I think is Iran
[02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:32.860]  And when you look at how they're surrounding, basically surrounding Iran with all these wars
[02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:36.860]  It's a divide and conquer kind of thing where they're going after Iran
[02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:38.860]  That's really what the ultimate prize is
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:42.860]  And if you go back and review the PNAC, they state that
[02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:44.860]  Iran was and is their primary goal
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:50.860]  Yeah, well there's a famous clip of Wesley Clark admitting the eight countries they were going to invade
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:54.860]  And he left the Pentagon about a year after and he came into one of the main planning areas
[02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:57.860]  Of course they let him see it all and they go, here's the countries we're going to invade
[02:44:57.860 --> 02:44:59.860]  Here's how we're going to do it
[02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:01.860]  And here's how we'll carry out the whole operation
[02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:03.860]  And here's how the countries will fall
[02:45:03.860 --> 02:45:06.860]  And they finally are going to bring down Saudi Arabia
[02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:12.860]  And Saudi Arabia has figured all that out now and it's like fighting their own people in Egypt
[02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:17.860]  The so-called U.S., Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Chase
[02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:21.860]  They run this country, one with the Sachs, Coburk, Goethers, and others
[02:45:21.860 --> 02:45:23.860]  The Queen of England, the Dutch Queen, others
[02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:25.860]  That's the main folks that own it all
[02:45:25.860 --> 02:45:32.860]  They are openly taking the funding now away from Egypt
[02:45:32.860 --> 02:45:36.860]  And I'm not defending foreign aid, but the point is they're taking it away because they're not doing what they're told
[02:45:36.860 --> 02:45:39.860]  To turn it over to Jihadi to just wreck everything
[02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:43.860]  And I've heard good old boys go, well good, that is a plan actually
[02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:46.860]  Let all them brown people kill themselves
[02:45:46.860 --> 02:45:50.860]  What's that going to do to oil prices? What's that going to do morally?
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:56.860]  I guarantee you these guys would not go over there with a hammer and beat all these kids' brains out
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:46:00.860]  I guarantee you they're looking at those little kids' eyes, they wouldn't have the will to nerve gas them
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:04.860]  But they'll give nerve gas to Al Qaeda and let them nerve gas little kids
[02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:07.860]  So that they can then take over the region
[02:46:07.860 --> 02:46:11.860]  They keep their hands clean, the CFR, the rest of them
[02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:15.860]  They sit back and just let horrible stuff go on
[02:46:15.860 --> 02:46:19.860]  And I don't know how they spiritually can't feel the impending doom
[02:46:19.860 --> 02:46:22.860]  That there's no way they're going to get away with it
[02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:24.860]  Or their kids are going to get away with it
[02:46:24.860 --> 02:46:26.860]  There are laws in this universe
[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:30.860]  And I know I'm ranting here, it's just that it's called God's fear
[02:46:30.860 --> 02:46:35.860]  Being God's fearing means you just realize the intergalactic rules here of the universe
[02:46:35.860 --> 02:46:42.860]  And of providence, that doing horrible things consciously and then reveling in it
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:46.860]  Is the ultimate sin, saying I know it's bad and I like it
[02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:52.860]  And I want to do it and I choose evil because I'm in charge and I'll do whatever I want
[02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:57.860]  That is the essence of evil, that is the essence of saying I want to be bad
[02:46:57.860 --> 02:47:02.860]  I want to be evil, I want to do nasty stuff, I want to hurt innocent people
[02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:04.860]  I want to be the wickedest of the wicked
[02:47:04.860 --> 02:47:09.860]  And it's those people that are going to destroy humanity if they have their way
[02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:10.860]  Anything else, Donna?
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:13.860]  One more thing I wanted to say, thanks for keeping the Michael Hastings being alive
[02:47:13.860 --> 02:47:15.860]  That is so important, I really appreciate it
[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:18.860]  Thanks for taking my call, bye
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:20.860]  Well thank you man, we're trying our best
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:25.860]  I mean it's just, I sit here and watch them trying to set this dead guy up in my opinion
[02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:28.860]  And that's where the evidence all points
[02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:31.860]  I want to believe he was hopped up on a bunch of drugs and went and did this
[02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:34.860]  But it just doesn't fit, they've been caught lying
[02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:38.860]  The FBI did go after him, they were investigating him, they did lie
[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:40.860]  The witnesses said the car blew up the middle of the street
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:49.860]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:56.860]  And it's just okay, but I guess I could just get the overwhelming go
[02:47:56.860 --> 02:48:00.860]  I buy the lie, fine, everything's fine, it's not as bad as I say
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:03.860]  Take your shots, drink your fluoride, government loves you
[02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:08.860]  Yeah, no protesting allowed in America, they're now announcing, even on Fox News
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:11.860]  They're talking about doing bail ins to take our bank accounts here
[02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:15.860]  Do it, take the pensions, take everything, fine, we're cursed, give into it
[02:48:15.860 --> 02:48:19.860]  Let the lowest of the low run around and just rule over us
[02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:23.860]  The triumph of the degenerate, because the good love to bow
[02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:28.860]  Let's talk to Michael in California, you're on the air about the gun confiscation
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:31.860]  Going on in California, what do you think of it?
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:36.860]  It's pretty scary, disturbing, I'm actually seeing a number of variables
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:42.860]  There's a gun confiscation, there's also the San Diego Craigslist ad about the surveillance role-player
[02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:48.860]  And we have Camp Pendleton in San Diego, which is I think like the third largest military base
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:52.860]  Oh, and we're in a DHS constitution-free zone
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:58.860]  So everything is, to me, just pointing to future false flag, massive gun confiscation
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:01.860]  And an excuse to take liberties away
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:05.860]  Well, the feds did say two weeks ago when they put out the fake terror alert
[02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:10.860]  Saying Austin would be hit by terrorists while lying to the public and saying it's only a drill
[02:49:10.860 --> 02:49:15.860]  But it really was fake that Southern California was also the sister target area
[02:49:15.860 --> 02:49:22.860]  And I mean, look, how else are the private contractors and the Pentagon going to take over America?
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:26.860]  I mean, you know, they kill Haji's all day, why not kill us?
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:32.860]  I mean, why not? I mean, they kill our troops after they get out with all the deadly drugs and stuff, why not?
[02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:37.860]  I mean, look, they're winners, they love killing people, they don't care, we're losers
[02:49:37.860 --> 02:49:41.860]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:45.860]  Yeah, I'm just freaking out, I don't really know what to do in this situation
[02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:49.860]  But I'm going to obviously document anything I see and I don't live in the main city
[02:49:49.860 --> 02:49:55.860]  So if anything goes on, I'll try and be there and film it and upload it on YouTube and anything I can do
[02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:57.860]  Well, good job bringing that up, brother
[02:49:57.860 --> 02:50:02.860]  And you know, to be serious here, I'm sometimes sarcastic for the people out there that love all this tyranny
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:09.860]  If you go to infowars.com and read the story by Julie Wilson
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:13.860]  In fact, I said already scrolled off the front page
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:19.860]  Alright, go to drudgereport.com and I had it here in my printout, I wanted to read it on air
[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:25.860]  But I'll find it during the break and come back and mention the part where it talks about domestic humet units
[02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:30.860]  Like, you've got to be with the CIA or Defense Department, five years of humet training
[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:35.860]  Or you've got to be part of the civilian brigade units in place
[02:50:35.860 --> 02:50:40.860]  And believe me, they're in place, I mean, years ago they came to my dad at every other dentist he knew
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:45.860]  And so we want you to spy on your patients, come to Homeland Security meetings and get paid, Dr. Jones
[02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:46.860]  How's that sound?
[02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:49.860]  And then my dad talked to other dentists, they all got called and a lot of them went
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:51.860]  And they're like, they're like, Bart, who's the enemy?
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:53.860]  Well, they don't like their government
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:56.860]  They talk about Obama and they like guns
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:59.860]  We're going to have to deal with these people soon
[02:50:59.860 --> 02:51:01.860]  You like being on the team?
[02:51:01.860 --> 02:51:03.860]  Hi there, my name is Frank Bates

[02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:23.860]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high
[02:51:23.860 --> 02:51:25.860]  Some have called this a conspiracy
[02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:31.860]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes
[02:51:31.860 --> 02:51:39.860]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too

[02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:24.860]  My name is Doug DiDero. For years I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes. This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace
[02:53:24.860 --> 02:53:31.860]  After being on one world away for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes
[02:53:31.860 --> 02:53:36.860]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone
[02:53:36.860 --> 02:53:44.860]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure
[02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:59.860]  Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325. 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's oneworldweeye.com
[02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:25.860]  Who is politically aware that when the military approaches you or Homeland Security and goes, we'd like you to work with us in secret agent stuff
[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:31.860]  And then you go to the meeting and it's like, yeah, there's gun owners and right wingers. We're gonna have to start arresting them soon
[02:54:31.860 --> 02:54:36.860]  I mean, this has been in the news and they had a big freak out a few months ago, as you know, in Denver, the state police were in there
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:39.860]  And they were like, we're gonna have to confiscate the guns from all Christians
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:45.860]  And they're like, is this a joke? They're like, no, this is real. We're really that evil
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:50.860]  I mean, this is the takeover, a foreign army. That's what Homeland Security is
[02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:55.860]  But this particular company, they might be being hired to run real drills
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:55:00.860]  But they've had drills before. What's that famous one Fort Bragg has every year?
[02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:07.860]  And they've had multiple times where the military cadets going into special forces think that they've...
[02:55:07.860 --> 02:55:11.860]  I think it's like November Sage or October Sage, I forget the exact name
[02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:15.860]  They'll go up and tackle cops, they think are part of it and the cops have killed them a couple times
[02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:18.860]  Because they'll be doing it, you know, 50 miles away from the base
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:23.860]  So, I mean, they do stuff like this that's real. It's just that sometimes you go out and you're part of a drill
[02:55:23.860 --> 02:55:27.860]  And your car's got a truck bomb in it and they blow you up and say you're a terrorist
[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:31.860]  And, you know, Sergeant First Class Johnson was a right winger
[02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:35.860]  And then the Alex Jones magazines are found at your apartment
[02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:42.860]  I mean, that's what they do. It's like, look, the Zarnab Brothers had a magazine that mentioned Alex Jones in it
[02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:48.860]  So, they did it because of Alex Jones and his deeply racistism
[02:55:48.860 --> 02:55:51.860]  I mean, this is the stuff they pull
[02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:55.860]  And so I know I harp on this and harp on this and harp on this, but you read the article
[02:55:55.860 --> 02:56:01.860]  San Diego Craigless adds searches for surveillance role-players
[02:56:01.860 --> 02:56:05.860]  Mandatory prerequisite qualifications
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:09.860]  A minimum of five years counterintelligence
[02:56:09.860 --> 02:56:13.860]  A bunch of grandstanding and or human intelligence, humet
[02:56:13.860 --> 02:56:17.860]  Experience with at least two operational deployments
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:22.860]  In military occupational specialty
[02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:28.860]  Or a member of a civilian intelligence community organization
[02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:32.860]  Ahh, like the youth femacore
[02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:36.860]  Who just want to come and create a relationship with you to prepare you
[02:56:36.860 --> 02:56:38.860]  It's called First Contact
[02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:41.860]  And all of this is about training you
[02:56:41.860 --> 02:56:45.860]  That when we say you line up against that wall, you line up or we'll taser you
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:48.860]  And next, we'll just cut you in half with a machine gun
[02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:55.860]  Because we're keeping America safe from the scary Muslims that the globalist publicly fund, run, support
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:59.860]  And are handing the whole planet over to
[02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:02.860]  By the way, you know it came out that Saudi Arabians coming to this country
[02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:05.860]  You don't have to get searched like other citizens because they complained
[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:08.860]  And I'm not saying the Saudi Arabians are terrorists, folks
[02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:11.860]  The point is this is pointed at the American people
[02:57:11.860 --> 02:57:14.860]  And that's now admitted, but just get it through your head
[02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:18.860]  They built homeland security to kill America
[02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:21.860]  They built homeland security to absorb the old republic
[02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:25.860]  Homeland security is the far and takeover beachhead
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:28.860]  It is the takeover operation
[02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:30.860]  This is not rhetoric
[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:36.860]  This is fact in quadruplicate, on quadruplicate, on quadruplicate, on quadruplicate
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:38.860]  The Federal Reserve is far and owned
[02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:39.860]  This is a fact
[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:44.860]  They used America's energy, power and ingenuity to establish the planetary government
[02:57:46.860 --> 02:57:48.860]  This is what they've done
[02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:51.860]  By the way, remind me, you guys said this a while back
[02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:54.860]  You said you ought to take calls from Egypt or Syria
[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:56.860]  We'll do that tomorrow
[02:57:56.860 --> 02:57:59.860]  In some hour of the show, and we got some big guests tomorrow
[02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:00.860]  I want to do specialty calls
[02:58:00.860 --> 02:58:04.860]  We're going to go a little bit of overdrive and go to Rashid and a few others
[02:58:04.860 --> 02:58:06.860]  Tom, Lucas and whoever else I can get to
[02:58:06.860 --> 02:58:08.860]  Right, keep and bear arms, you need to get to him
[02:58:08.860 --> 02:58:11.860]  But, and some stations don't carry it, but infowars.com, port slash show

[02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:32.860]  And this human installation
[02:58:32.860 --> 02:58:38.860]  This true organic American citizens installation against the globalist takeover
[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:41.860]  We are the resistance, you are the resistance
[02:58:41.860 --> 02:58:44.860]  We are the only hope, you have to take action

[02:59:54.860 --> 02:59:58.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[02:59:58.860 --> 02:59:59.860]  Network
[03:00:05.860 --> 03:00:09.860]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[03:00:09.860 --> 03:00:11.860]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.860 --> 03:00:16.860]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:21.860]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:26.860]  By the way, on our article about gun confiscation
[03:00:26.860 --> 03:00:28.860]  Beginning out in California
[03:00:28.860 --> 03:00:31.860]  These are official communist Chinese photos
[03:00:31.860 --> 03:00:33.860]  They have public executions, it's of a 12 year old girl
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:35.860]  Being shot in the back of the head
[03:00:35.860 --> 03:00:37.860]  You can type in Chinese executions
[03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:39.860]  You can actually see after they've blown her head off
[03:00:39.860 --> 03:00:41.860]  That's for criticizing the communist
[03:00:41.860 --> 03:00:43.860]  That says, gun control works great
[03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:45.860]  If you're the one who controls the guns
[03:00:45.860 --> 03:00:48.860]  I'm gonna go copy that into my phone and tweet that
[03:00:48.860 --> 03:00:50.860]  As soon as the broadcast ends
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:51.860]  Here in just a few minutes
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:53.860]  And please retweet it out to everybody you know
[03:00:53.860 --> 03:00:55.860]  Real Alex Jones, follow us right there
[03:00:55.860 --> 03:00:58.860]  Rashid wants to talk about Michael Hastings
[03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:00.860]  You're on the air, thanks for holding from Pennsylvania
[03:01:00.860 --> 03:01:05.860]  Hey, I'm a first time caller
[03:01:05.860 --> 03:01:09.860]  I don't know, I wanted to mention about
[03:01:09.860 --> 03:01:11.860]  The Hastings interview
[03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:13.860]  It was basically common sense
[03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:15.860]  What he was talking about
[03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:20.860]  And I had two memes on my computer
[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:23.860]  Which was basically saying
[03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:25.860]  Almost the same thing
[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:27.860]  I hadn't watched the interview
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:29.860]  But I went back and watched
[03:01:29.860 --> 03:01:31.860]  You're talking about his last interview
[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:33.860]  We said they're coming after the press
[03:01:33.860 --> 03:01:35.860]  Stand against the America's going into tyranny
[03:01:35.860 --> 03:01:37.860]  We gotta declare war on the tyrants
[03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:40.860]  Boom, car blows up, everything's fine
[03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:45.860]  And the two memes that I had on my computer
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:48.860]  Basically said the same thing
[03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:51.860]  And it was weird
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:53.860]  Well, people are thinking the same thing, brother
[03:01:53.860 --> 03:01:55.860]  I go over all over town, people are printing up memes
[03:01:55.860 --> 03:01:56.860]  In fact, I'm gonna do this
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:57.860]  We're creating an area on the site
[03:01:57.860 --> 03:01:59.860]  With all the great posters we've already made
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:01.860]  Folks can submit memes to us
[03:02:01.860 --> 03:02:03.860]  We'll have memes of the day
[03:02:03.860 --> 03:02:04.860]  Like a new fresh page every day
[03:02:04.860 --> 03:02:06.860]  That then goes to maybe a Pinterest account
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:08.860]  Or something of memes
[03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:09.860]  I'm just gonna do this right now
[03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:12.860]  And then we can, everybody can print up them as flyers
[03:02:12.860 --> 03:02:13.860]  And just hang them everywhere
[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:15.860]  We're gonna beat these tyrants
[03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:16.860]  And you guys were saying
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:18.860]  And I've been seeing really cool memes
[03:02:18.860 --> 03:02:20.860]  They're getting hung up all over the place
[03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:22.860]  And it's just time for us to fight back
[03:02:22.860 --> 03:02:24.860]  They don't want to side on overpasses
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:26.860]  They're gonna choke us if we go out and say
[03:02:26.860 --> 03:02:27.860]  In Peach, Obama
[03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:29.860]  Well, how about we choke the new old order out
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:31.860]  With just numbers
[03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:33.860]  Peacefully, absolutely
[03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:35.860]  Just stand up like a glacier
[03:02:35.860 --> 03:02:37.860]  And it moves very slowly
[03:02:37.860 --> 03:02:39.860]  But when your mole moves in unison
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:40.860]  Nothing can stand in its way
[03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:42.860]  God bless you, I appreciate your call
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:43.860]  Right to keepin' bare arms
[03:02:43.860 --> 03:02:46.860]  You're on the air from Oregon, sir
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:48.860]  President, planet, subscriber
[03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:49.860]  Thank you for having me on, Alex
[03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:51.860]  Thank you, sir, couldn't do it without you
[03:02:51.860 --> 03:02:53.860]  Got two issues
[03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:55.860]  First one, speaking of qualified candidates
[03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:57.860]  And searching for
[03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:59.860]  In the future, it's obvious that we have
[03:02:59.860 --> 03:03:03.860]  Some imposters occupying our White House
[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:05.860]  And our Congress and our Senate
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:08.860]  But on the top, the obvious candidate
[03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:10.860]  I don't know if you've ever been asked
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:13.860]  But if we remove this occupier
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:14.860]  That's occupying our White House
[03:03:14.860 --> 03:03:16.860]  I think we have our obvious candidate
[03:03:16.860 --> 03:03:18.860]  Which would be Alex Jones
[03:03:18.860 --> 03:03:20.860]  No, man, I tell ya
[03:03:20.860 --> 03:03:22.860]  I don't have any skeletons in my closet
[03:03:22.860 --> 03:03:25.860]  But I got a lot of stuff hiding right up front
[03:03:25.860 --> 03:03:28.860]  I mean, let me tell ya, boy
[03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:31.860]  And just wait till they go
[03:03:31.860 --> 03:03:33.860]  Actually find people I went to high school with and stuff
[03:03:33.860 --> 03:03:36.860]  I, of course, I don't know
[03:03:36.860 --> 03:03:37.860]  I didn't ever torture animals
[03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:39.860]  Like George W. Bush, I guess
[03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:42.860]  That probably precludes me from being a...
[03:03:42.860 --> 03:03:44.860]  But I was pretty wild
[03:03:44.860 --> 03:03:46.860]  You know, I think of myself as a media person
[03:03:46.860 --> 03:03:47.860]  That's what's more effective
[03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:50.860]  I think I know Rand Paul personally
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:53.860]  I trust Rand Paul, and he is also very deaf
[03:03:53.860 --> 03:03:56.860]  I would support Rand Paul for president
[03:03:56.860 --> 03:03:57.860]  I think you're gonna see that happen
[03:03:57.860 --> 03:04:00.860]  And somebody like Ted Cruz as vice president
[03:04:00.860 --> 03:04:03.860]  I think Cruz, I don't know him
[03:04:03.860 --> 03:04:05.860]  So I can't, you know, there's that problem
[03:04:05.860 --> 03:04:06.860]  That's why I say I like Rand
[03:04:06.860 --> 03:04:09.860]  But Ted Cruz is just as good in some ways better
[03:04:09.860 --> 03:04:11.860]  The problem is he's got that dual Canadian citizenship
[03:04:11.860 --> 03:04:13.860]  So they'll use that against him
[03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:14.860]  Like he did something wrong
[03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:17.860]  He's renouncing it now, but...
[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:20.860]  So that's why I'd say he'd be the VP place
[03:04:20.860 --> 03:04:23.860]  What do you think of a Rand Cruz ticket?
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:25.860]  A Paul Cruz ticket?
[03:04:25.860 --> 03:04:27.860]  You got my vote out
[03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:29.860]  And yeah, that's not gonna save the world either
[03:04:29.860 --> 03:04:31.860]  But the fact that he's now the front-runner
[03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:33.860]  And a lot of polls shows we're gonna get something done
[03:04:33.860 --> 03:04:34.860]  I mean, you know
[03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:36.860]  And that's why the socialists hate him so much
[03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:38.860]  Because they think they're gonna take the government over
[03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:40.860]  And make everything better, you know
[03:04:40.860 --> 03:04:42.860]  People like Webster Tarpley who's mad at me
[03:04:42.860 --> 03:04:43.860]  Won't even come on the show now
[03:04:43.860 --> 03:04:45.860]  Because I'm not into all that stuff
[03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:46.860]  God bless him
[03:04:46.860 --> 03:04:48.860]  He's got a lot of good ideas about the problems
[03:04:48.860 --> 03:04:50.860]  You know, he thinks they're gonna get the government
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:52.860]  And that's somehow gonna fix it
[03:04:52.860 --> 03:04:53.860]  And it just doesn't work
[03:04:53.860 --> 03:04:56.860]  Collectivism in a central system doesn't work
[03:04:56.860 --> 03:05:18.860]  It doesn't work out on co-ops most of the time
