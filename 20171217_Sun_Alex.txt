[01:39.360 --> 01:45.640]  traditional culture and not the corporate technocratic synthetic anti-human
[01:45.640 --> 01:53.400]  overwrite that is taking place on a planetary scale wow every time I get in

[01:57.280 --> 02:01.520]  gets more intense it gets more out of control we do have a lot of amazing
[02:01.520 --> 02:08.720]  information to break down obviously today even mainstream media I couldn't
[02:08.720 --> 02:15.920]  believe it in the even the Associated Press has articles out today saying a lot
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.880]  of evidence of political taint a lot of evidence of political spin a lot of
[02:19.880 --> 02:27.920]  evidence of political forgery or frame up of Trump on Russia there isn't a lot
[02:27.920 --> 02:36.240]  of evidence it is cuckoo level over-the-top ridiculous it would be
[02:36.240 --> 02:41.680]  like as I've said a man who's divorcing his wife and he's the family court judge
[02:41.680 --> 02:47.760]  in the divorce case or vice versa or Hitler being the judge at Nuremberg
[02:47.760 --> 02:58.040]  over the Nazis I mean it's it'd be like Lex Luthor being Superman's daddy it's
[02:58.040 --> 03:07.240]  that ridiculous it's like saying Hitler's black or something I mean it
[03:07.240 --> 03:14.200]  it's just or the Dallas Cowboys or the Washington Redskins I mean it's it is so
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.720]  over-the-top and so unbelievable where you've got all these FBI agents
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.240]  manufacturing evidence they admit and emails and and text messages that they're
[03:23.240 --> 03:26.560]  trying to frame Trump and rig stuff you got the head of the program of the
[03:26.560 --> 03:29.840]  Justice Department giving millions of dollars to his wife that heads up the
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.360]  fusion GPS you've got the same people going to the judge and getting the fake
[03:35.360 --> 03:40.400]  warrant the judge refusing themselves and it just goes on and on no wonder
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.760]  they've been fighting not to release all their emails and text messages to the
[03:45.760 --> 03:51.480]  Congress because as we get them it is ridiculous and then Trump blasts that is
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.440]  wrong and they go oh you're gonna fire Mueller oh you hate the FBI if a plane
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.040]  gets hijacked by criminals you don't blame American Airlines because some
[04:02.040 --> 04:06.960]  guy hijacked it and then said he was the captain and put on the uniform of the
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.080]  captain he shot it's been hijacked the FBI certainly had its problems in its
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.280]  history but the point is is that the way they're behaving now is the most
[04:16.280 --> 04:22.360]  corrupt for even third-world countries this is banana boat banana Republic type
[04:22.360 --> 04:29.240]  garbage this is this is just fantastical so Trump heads the FBI for
[04:29.240 --> 04:32.840]  graduation ceremony after months of bad blood between White House and Bureau

[07:27.960 --> 07:34.600]  where to begin this transmission in the last week we saw congressional hearings
[07:34.600 --> 07:41.240]  as new documents were relieved showing total collusion between senior FBI the
[07:41.240 --> 07:49.040]  Justice Department the Clintons Obama Fusion GPS where many of the agents
[07:49.040 --> 07:56.000]  wives and husbands worked getting money from the FBI to create the fraud you've
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.920]  now learned of multiple individuals that worked at Fusion GPS that then also had
[07:59.920 --> 08:04.120]  family in the FBI Justice Department and they're in the emails and text messages
[08:04.120 --> 08:09.560]  saying we're gonna set Trump up we're gonna make this up we got to stop them
[08:09.560 --> 08:13.320]  and of course it's known that that is all completely made up but that's what they
[08:13.320 --> 08:17.080]  used to get the fake warrants and just all the rest of it it's it's simply
[08:17.080 --> 08:26.760]  incredible and then the media spins all of this like Trump hates the FBI no
[08:26.760 --> 08:32.680]  Trump hates the Clinton criminal network the coup over the bureau that got
[08:32.680 --> 08:38.680]  control that's what happened and how they've had a political reign of terror
[08:38.680 --> 08:44.160]  prosecuting conservatives libertarians Christian groups removing 501c3
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.080]  standing having the IRS harassed people I mean it has been Dinesh to Susan going
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.360]  to prison for doing nothing
[08:53.360 --> 08:58.440]  one one trillionth of what Hillary's done this political reign of terror we've
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.160]  been witnessing it looks like something you'd have in communist China or Nazi
[09:02.160 --> 09:11.120]  Germany or socialist Venezuela today this is Banana Republic garbage and I
[09:11.120 --> 09:14.760]  don't see how they're gonna get out of this now because more documents are
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.040]  coming out as as the FBI goes under contempt of Congress and Trump is
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.360]  basically ordering them to release it Rosenstein's in deep trouble he's a
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.240]  Clinton operative and you've got McCabe the ringleader we now learn when he was
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.840]  deputy director now acting director the bad advice Trump got and he didn't know
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.400]  he got advised oh this is a good guy sir and he is the ringleader in the text
[09:39.400 --> 09:44.080]  messages in the emails and in the notes of the meetings where they're like we
[09:44.080 --> 09:47.000]  got to bring candidate Trump down he's like well I don't think he's gonna get
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.440]  elected but I agree with you well we got a set up an insurance policy I mean
[09:51.440 --> 09:59.200]  wow and then Rosenstein's involved in uranium one so is Mueller I mean these
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.920]  people need to be arrested on espionage charges and I've been saying this for a
[10:03.920 --> 10:07.040]  long time it's why they got so scared of Trump getting in and went with the
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.280]  Russian narrative because every one of these individuals is up to their eyeballs
[10:12.280 --> 10:19.480]  in Russian money they're all part of these law firms to get the waivers when
[10:19.480 --> 10:22.840]  Clinton was in so they could do these these deals and be on the boards of
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.800]  companies where they don't even invest money and then they get huge dividends
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.080]  other people have to invest 5 million 10 million in one of the companies Mueller's
[10:31.080 --> 10:34.360]  involved in Mueller made no investment and gets money from it oh we're just
[10:34.360 --> 10:38.240]  gonna put you on the company you don't do anything here's money because he killed
[10:38.240 --> 10:44.520]  the investigation in the uranium one I mean this is open and shut a jury would
[10:44.520 --> 10:49.920]  fry Mueller if there was still an electric chair he'd be sent to it like
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.120]  the Rosenbergs for espionage
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.080]  think about that I mean no wonder they're trying to get Trump saying he's a
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.200]  foreign agent because they are and that means they'll do anything to protect
[11:06.200 --> 11:13.000]  themselves anything and that's why we've got this article it's up on info wars
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.920]  dot com coming up I'm gonna play the video from it I have to tell the crew to
[11:19.920 --> 11:25.640]  get this we guys get this thank you it's up on info wars dot com ex FBI chief
[11:25.640 --> 11:32.280]  stroke belongs in prison Strock belongs in prison for fabricating information

[11:38.200 --> 11:43.680]  Peter Strock a total moron close quote by total moron I mean he's in emails and
[11:43.680 --> 11:48.480]  text messages framing people who belongs in Leavenworth that's a quote federal
[11:48.480 --> 11:53.080]  prison during a TV appearance Thursday Colstrom a former marine captain the
[11:53.080 --> 11:57.920]  Vietnam veteran told Fox Business News Elizabeth Donald that of an FBI agent
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.640]  wanted to stop someone from becoming president I think he can do that do what
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.560]  he tried to do adding he can fabricate things he can make stuff up he can lie
[12:07.560 --> 12:13.200]  he can be a total moron you know he belongs in Leavenworth this guy in my
[12:13.200 --> 12:20.320]  personal view I don't just get up here and say they should go to prison I know
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.080]  how to read the law and when they're on emails on text messages all saying
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.040]  they're making stuff up and they're paying for fake dossiers and it's their
[12:29.040 --> 12:37.360]  wives doing it it's a payoff as well the head of the entire Justice Department
[12:37.360 --> 12:44.840]  division on Russia his wife headed up the threat GPS operation I mean that is
[12:44.840 --> 12:51.960]  just insane and it's fake to boot I got so much other big news but we're gonna
[12:51.960 --> 12:55.800]  play this clip coming up it's on info wars.com but they're trying to spin it
[12:55.800 --> 13:01.800]  that Trump's in trouble and Trump wants to get rid of all these people and you
[13:01.800 --> 13:06.560]  know that Trump is is is it hates the whole FBI Trump heads the FBI for
[13:06.560 --> 13:09.720]  graduation ceremony after months of bad blood between the White House and the
[13:09.720 --> 13:15.840]  Bureau growing evidence of politically tainted Clinton investigation oh yeah all
[13:15.840 --> 13:21.880]  the same people struck stroke whatever his stupid name is they're the ones over
[13:21.880 --> 13:25.000]  the Clinton investigations that deep six those and shut those down while they
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.600]  told the public the investigations were still ongoing and then of course coming
[13:29.600 --> 13:33.000]  line to Congress and coming line about the memos and coming line about leaking
[13:33.000 --> 13:38.440]  to Congress I mean they're all going for broke committing more crimes because

[13:43.440 --> 13:46.480]  lies out and stop Trump then they tried to stop it when he was president elect
[13:46.480 --> 13:49.280]  now they're trying to talk when he's president I mean if you're gonna try to
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.800]  take down an elected popular president with the economy coming back and
[13:53.800 --> 13:57.320]  everything else you're gonna do anything you understand it's like if you

[21:06.320 --> 21:09.680]  moment because strock and the rest of them have all been caught in meetings
[21:09.680 --> 21:13.840]  with the deputy director now the director trying to frame the president i
[21:13.840 --> 21:19.360]  mean right now it's just like tragiotti said earlier this week he'd be
[21:19.360 --> 21:23.160]  surprised if the new director is even there this week that doesn't mean
[21:23.160 --> 21:28.240]  trumps gonna fire mccabe mccabe had better resign i mean he is in emails and
[21:28.240 --> 21:32.840]  text messages talking about framing the president this was in this was in
[21:32.840 --> 21:36.640]  congressional hearings last week and i've seen very little news coverage of
[21:36.640 --> 21:43.600]  it it's just incredible meanwhile all the so-called comedy shows that they
[21:43.600 --> 21:47.520]  admit a really propaganda shows with chuck schumer the democratic party
[21:47.520 --> 21:52.560]  calling up many of the late night hosts literally telling them what to say and
[21:52.560 --> 22:01.480]  do well now the simpsons depicts trump trying to bribe Mueller think about that
[22:01.480 --> 22:08.040]  and again it's everywhere we go oh it's just funny no it's not it's fusing GPS
[22:08.040 --> 22:12.880]  got two plus million dollars of taxpayer money from the head of the just
[22:12.880 --> 22:19.720]  department russia program to his wife running the fusion GPS dossier she
[22:19.720 --> 22:27.360]  admits she was hired on to do that job and then left you can't be at the
[22:27.360 --> 22:31.080]  justice department give your wife two million dollars and again no one's
[22:31.080 --> 22:39.480]  picked up on that just like we read the patents in 2006 where they said google
[22:39.480 --> 22:42.800]  and facebook and to and all these things are gonna be watching and listening to
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.920]  you and then now the daily mail today google and amazon really do spy on you
[22:47.920 --> 22:51.920]  patent reveals future versions of their voice assistance which record your
[22:51.920 --> 22:55.320]  conversations to sell you products they're already doing it but that's the
[22:55.320 --> 23:00.960]  daily mail we have the patents 11 years ago doing it and they've been doing it
[23:00.960 --> 23:06.080]  but i mean you can't have the just department head who runs the program
[23:06.080 --> 23:13.080]  order the money paid to his wife who just gets hired for that contract you
[23:13.080 --> 23:22.640]  have them red-handed 100% red-handed that's a whole other subject let me
[23:22.640 --> 23:27.400]  just get back here here's the little simpson's piece again we're uh-huh it's
[23:27.400 --> 23:33.680]  funny but it creates this perception my wife has very nice family who's been
[23:33.680 --> 23:37.800]  on to visit us her cousin she came down here she's very freaked out by Trump
[23:37.800 --> 23:41.760]  she's a registered nurse and she sent my wife a text message saying I just
[23:41.760 --> 23:45.080]  Trump's ruining my life I'm just so depressed now because of Trump and all
[23:45.080 --> 23:48.440]  the bad things he's doing to the country so she called her and said what's wrong
[23:48.440 --> 23:52.200]  and she said well he hasn't anything I can see I just I just see it all over
[23:52.200 --> 23:56.840]  the news that's them trying to brainwash you what the economy's up
[23:56.840 --> 24:04.200]  confidence is up the border is getting more controlled it's all fraud but
[24:04.200 --> 24:09.320]  that's the weak-minded out there falling to the mind control and and so many
[24:09.320 --> 24:14.320]  people are depressed and upset it's even in the news about Trump they don't
[24:14.320 --> 24:17.840]  because their identity was tied up in the government in Hollywood that hates
[24:17.840 --> 24:21.680]  their guts in the old Democratic Party and the Republican Party establishment
[24:21.680 --> 24:26.560]  this is a revolution people ought to be happy for it Trump's just a manifestation
[24:26.560 --> 24:34.640]  of the revolution it's happening all the world so here's the Simpsons piece
[24:36.560 --> 24:42.040]  it's in with sessions you're not taking me to see the president are you you know
[24:42.040 --> 24:45.520]  I can't what are you talking about our president would never stay in an
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.240]  overstated ripoff joint like this from hotel
[24:51.240 --> 24:56.200]  good boss by the way everything and all these shows and movies you notice they
[24:56.200 --> 25:01.240]  attack his hotels they attack his golf courses the FBI has harassed all of his
[25:01.240 --> 25:06.640]  people that have bought condos from him they visited all of them they've the the
[25:06.640 --> 25:11.840]  golf course members everyone at Marlago they're harassing him trying to bankrupt
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.680]  him they admit it thousands of lawsuits so again this is true harassment you're
[25:16.680 --> 25:22.800]  watching let's continue now mr. Mueller go right through that door unimpeachable
[25:22.800 --> 25:39.480]  first oh hi pop come on in don't worry I'm not gonna fire you I wanted to share
[25:39.480 --> 25:49.920]  something I love how the Saturday Night Live shows and on Fox everywhere the
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.640]  Simpsons they depict sessions as a criminal who's constantly engaged in
[25:55.640 --> 26:00.320]  corruption who's a pedophile and who's a racist with zero evidence instead it's
[26:00.320 --> 26:05.840]  known that he's been one of the cleanest people in the modern Senate and he
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.080]  should have done more against their corruption if there's any criticism it's
[26:09.080 --> 26:13.240]  that he's been intimidated into being a lapdog now and is ruining his great
[26:13.240 --> 26:17.760]  record but again see what he gets for laying there and taking all this crap
[26:17.760 --> 26:27.120]  every program shows him as a criminal now let's continue that's 750 million
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.080]  dollars Bob huge pride there's never been a bigger one I do the best bribes
[26:32.080 --> 26:38.120]  everyone says so the best everyone says so the best everybody says so mr.
[26:38.120 --> 26:43.040]  president you're the right to remain silent any on me I said you well I'm
[26:43.040 --> 26:48.480]  not talking to you I tried to pardon myself it won't work okay new tech
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.680]  you're a very upright guy how would you like to be a judge at the missy was
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.000]  again they just act like Mueller's this bastion of goodness everywhere and all
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.880]  the magazines all the fake newspapers all the fiction shows this wall and he's
[27:01.880 --> 27:05.400]  this horrible guy that covered up uranium one covered up the foundation
[27:05.400 --> 27:10.120]  still no money from the kids and Haiti covered up all the horrible crimes did
[27:10.120 --> 27:13.680]  all these terrible things got money himself from the Russians he they did
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.080]  all this stuff but he's this angel and its news core about to be bought by
[27:18.080 --> 27:23.360]  Disney it's right there always doing it let's continue see this year's girls just
[27:23.360 --> 27:30.080]  go in the door that says don't go in so it's another attack that he's gonna go
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.960]  in and basically rape women at the pageants again just pushing that whole
[27:33.960 --> 27:36.720]  hoax and then you
[27:39.280 --> 27:43.560]  a little bit more left of the clip okay let's just stop right there now let me
[27:43.560 --> 27:49.280]  go ahead now and go to the next little piece here because all that was left was
[27:49.280 --> 27:52.360]  the maid comes in to clean up the money but it's really the Puerto Rico mayor
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.560]  and she's an angel because Trump wouldn't get Puerto Rico any money but now
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.720]  she finally vacuum cleaners the money for him fraud after fraud after fraud
[27:59.720 --> 28:04.520]  after fraud after fraud after fraud after fraud after fraud when the record
[28:04.520 --> 28:08.520]  money to Puerto Rico but here is the former deputy director James Colstrom

[28:13.880 --> 28:20.280]  president from getting elected well I think he can do what this guy tried to
[28:20.280 --> 28:26.600]  do he can fabricate things he can make up stuff he can lie he can be a total
[28:26.600 --> 28:31.000]  moron he can recruit others you know he belongs in Leavenworth this guy in my
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.480]  personal view I don't have all the facts but from what I know he belongs behind
[28:35.480 --> 28:41.440]  bars this guy you know these things cannot happen in a democracy it's
[28:41.440 --> 28:44.600]  absolutely totally rigged they've been caught trying to frame the president
[28:44.600 --> 28:50.880]  open and shut case Mueller coming McCabe

[33:01.960 --> 33:13.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show what can an FBI official and FBI agent do
[33:13.040 --> 33:19.440]  to stop a president from getting elected well I think you can do what this
[33:19.440 --> 33:25.240]  guy tried to do he can fabricate things he can make up stuff he can lie it's the
[33:25.240 --> 33:29.640]  claim that the August protest was some sort of a left-wing plot who he might
[33:29.640 --> 33:33.080]  ask would say something so offensive an elected representative who's serving
[33:33.080 --> 33:37.120]  right now in the US Congress and look at the background George Soros is one of
[33:37.120 --> 33:40.880]  those people that actually helps them you know back these individuals who is
[33:40.880 --> 33:46.040]  he my understanding is is that you went out with this protector of yours who
[33:46.040 --> 33:53.200]  swore that you were his adopted god son yes yes went out in fact and helped in
[33:53.200 --> 33:57.480]  the confiscation of property from the Jews that's right
[34:00.600 --> 34:04.160]  was it difficult
[34:04.600 --> 34:10.920]  but not not at all do you think George Soros funded the neo-nazis who marched in
[34:10.920 --> 34:14.400]  Charleston it would be interesting to find out these conspiracy theories were
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.520]  first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones is this lost on anyone George
[34:19.520 --> 34:26.880]  Soros is a famous Nazi collaborator from the front lines of the information war
[34:26.880 --> 34:33.560]  it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we're back live the reason I
[34:33.560 --> 34:40.280]  entered this segment with that is there's got to be a PR contract out and
[34:40.280 --> 34:46.600]  this is just not my opinion many times when you see in the news a corporate
[34:46.600 --> 34:50.440]  figure a government figure or a product being promoted and they're saying good
[34:50.440 --> 34:54.840]  positive things about it the stations the networks the papers are being paid to
[34:54.840 --> 35:00.840]  do it CNN has gotten billions of dollars in its parent company from Gulf
[35:00.840 --> 35:07.120]  states to do PR pieces on CNN International particularly defending
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.600]  genocides you name it that's famous they've had their employees quit and go
[35:10.600 --> 35:15.040]  public we've had them on but I know Soros has done this because in the last
[35:15.040 --> 35:23.480]  six months I've seen ABC CBS NBC CNN you name it New York Times Washington Post
[35:23.480 --> 35:30.880]  Newsweek come out and say Alex Jones is an anti-Semite and he has an anti-semitic
[35:30.880 --> 35:35.880]  story he's pushing that George Soros is a Nazi then they never have me say
[35:35.880 --> 35:45.520]  anything anti-Semitic they say Jones claims that George Soros was a Nazi or a
[35:45.520 --> 35:52.360]  Nazi collaborator and then Soros is big foundations and move on they also funds
[35:52.360 --> 35:57.720]  our funding movies TV shows groups about sexual harassment saying Trump needs to
[35:57.720 --> 36:02.640]  be removed that's in the news so I say hey the Nazi collaborator is funding
[36:02.640 --> 36:08.600]  this and they put an article out with the headline Alex Jones spins anti-semitic
[36:08.600 --> 36:14.320]  conspiracy because Soros is Jewish you see you can't talk about him or your
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.800]  anti-semitic it just doesn't work even people in the comments go what's
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.880]  anti-semitic in this Alex Jones spends anti-semitic
[36:22.880 --> 36:29.120]  spirits scene that George Soros created sexual misconduct allegations to hurt
[36:29.120 --> 36:33.280]  Trump no I predicted they were gonna burn YC and others that were already in
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.680]  trouble have a space to you name it who deserved to get in trouble to build this
[36:37.680 --> 36:41.080]  momentum to then say well Trump's got to step down just from allegations and
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.720]  they now say that so they don't know how to handle the fact that I've already
[36:46.720 --> 36:51.560]  studied how they operate and quite frankly it's very formulaic how they do
[36:51.560 --> 36:55.520]  all this it's pathetic that they've been ruling us so long because you were just
[36:55.520 --> 36:59.840]  aware of their operation of you know this globalist operation you realize
[36:59.840 --> 37:06.960]  it's not Nazi it's not Jewish it's not you know it's satanic it is psychotic it
[37:06.960 --> 37:13.120]  is anti-human you've been around a psychotic or mentally ill person they
[37:13.120 --> 37:17.360]  just do bad stuff they can't help but do sneaky manipulative bad things they are
[37:17.360 --> 37:22.040]  mentally ill but they tend to get in power historically the amount of
[37:22.040 --> 37:26.200]  psychopaths in power positions is just astronomically high compared to their
[37:26.200 --> 37:29.240]  very low number in the general population what maybe one out of a hundred
[37:29.240 --> 37:34.120]  people is a pure sociopath maybe one out of three hundreds of pure psychopath
[37:34.120 --> 37:39.280]  but artificially than smartphones the culture the people being disconnected
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.920]  they are becoming artificial sociopaths and psychopaths because generally it's
[37:44.920 --> 37:52.560]  genetic you have predisposition it loads the gun nature then nurture pulls the
[37:52.560 --> 37:57.240]  trigger and and their studies out that there are more psychopaths and more
[37:57.240 --> 38:02.000]  sociopaths right now and a lot of it is in primitive times people that act like
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.640]  that get taken out usually but see when you don't weed those people out I'm not
[38:05.640 --> 38:09.040]  saying that's a good thing but usually psychopaths get killed pretty young but
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.920]  when you when they don't get in trouble well then they get in power so you know
[38:13.920 --> 38:17.240]  there it is why social media training is all in a sociopath I mean there's big
[38:17.240 --> 38:22.360]  reports on this so you read the article and it's I'm not covering it to defend
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.840]  myself I was probably attacked in a hundred publications the last day like
[38:25.840 --> 38:28.800]  oh look I'm in the story let me talk about it I'm talking about it because of
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.040]  the learning experience for everybody to understand you read it there's not one
[38:32.040 --> 38:36.840]  bad things that about Jews Jews are diverse people like anybody else this
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.400]  guy's a dirtbag piece of crap worse than the Nazis because he sold out his own
[38:41.400 --> 38:45.600]  people and I just played you 60 minutes saying he's not sad about it he's proud
[38:45.600 --> 38:50.000]  of it somebody would have filled that niche economically but I've got like it's
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.040]  a 15 minute interview me play the whole thing in they do not like that video so
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.280]  there it is boy I'm Annie Semitic for talking about about George Soros and one
[39:01.280 --> 39:07.360]  commenter goes Soros is the dinner bell for the Pavlovian you know stuff in the
[39:07.360 --> 39:11.400]  right wing like he's behind everything I've done massive studying he is
[39:11.400 --> 39:17.200]  literally chipping in or the prime funder of every massive globalist evil
[39:17.200 --> 39:21.680]  operation before that it was David Rockefeller nobody puts in more money
[39:21.680 --> 39:26.480]  nobody works harder to collapse civilizations and destroy currencies and
[39:26.480 --> 39:31.160]  make people poor he's famous for doing it he's got a rest warrants out like nine
[39:31.160 --> 39:38.280]  countries he's been convicted in least four he's famous he's famous they make
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.960]  James Bond movies about him where the quantum group is gonna bankrupt the
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.840]  world economy that's his group the quantum group and then my six said no we
[39:47.840 --> 39:51.760]  advise the writers of the latest James Bond to do it about Soros because he
[39:51.760 --> 39:58.280]  tried to crash the pound five separate times destroy everybody's savings just
[39:58.280 --> 40:07.040]  he's horrible he's a selfish bloated demonic piece of crap and he's got all
[40:07.040 --> 40:10.960]  the sycophantic liberals just lovin it because all their little cockroach groups
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.680]  get fed by the neck leads me to the next story here's the big story ladies and
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.400]  gentlemen you know what I'm just gonna hit it in the next second because it's so

[48:25.200 --> 48:34.680]  serious here Antifa is a Marxist Leninist Bolshevik organization if you
[48:34.680 --> 48:41.240]  go to their main websites it says it on them they call for a violent overthrow
[48:41.240 --> 48:49.400]  of the capitalist state in the West and they call by any means necessary
[48:49.400 --> 48:53.480]  including the killing of police officers citizens you name it and I could
[48:53.480 --> 48:59.480]  play you dozens of clips from MSNBC CNN with their host interviewing the heads
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.560]  of it saying yes we believe violence is okay because you're Nazis you dehumanize
[49:04.560 --> 49:09.480]  your opposition you call them Nazis it's exact Nazi behavior they just would call
[49:09.480 --> 49:12.720]  you Jews or whatever the second you're Jewish you deserve to die or whatever
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.120]  group the Nazis were targeting they targeted a lot so then after they've
[49:16.120 --> 49:19.440]  dehumanized you they stab you they hit you and they have with a bike lock they
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.080]  burn your car up you know they rob you and then they celebrate how they're
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.760]  heroes and so George Soros is one of the main funders but it's got the Ford
[49:29.760 --> 49:38.360]  Foundation and Apple Amazon Google Twitter they all fund the foundations
[49:38.360 --> 49:44.120]  that fund them it's a fact go to their websites type in main Antifa website in
[49:44.120 --> 49:46.480]  fact they've got it right there put it on screen in the New York Times full page
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.560]  ad if you click on that on the full page ad yeah click it on there for me right
[49:51.560 --> 49:57.160]  there because I there it is refuse fascism.org you go there and it says
[49:57.160 --> 50:03.800]  they're openly funded by the move on.org and that's funded by Soros and all the
[50:03.800 --> 50:07.640]  rest of it I mean it's just crazy and they say we're gonna drive the president
[50:07.640 --> 50:13.840]  from office starting November 4th here's the times we're gonna be out they
[50:13.840 --> 50:17.280]  had mainstream media come out and say Alex Jones is lying in hundreds of
[50:17.280 --> 50:22.640]  publications there is no Antifa plan November 4th to launch an overthrow
[50:22.640 --> 50:28.080]  there is no plan there is no planning of course that's a military tactic they buy
[50:28.080 --> 50:31.640]  at the New York Times or in their publications rise up rise up the
[50:31.640 --> 50:35.840]  establishment uses it as astroturf as the so-called grassroots resistance but a
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.680]  lot of times when Antifa does get arrested they're college professors they
[50:41.680 --> 50:48.040]  are federal bureaucrats and so they're out there pushing all of this garbage
[50:48.040 --> 50:51.640]  because they want to bully you the American people into being under their
[50:51.640 --> 50:58.880]  control so they're constantly denying that they're trying all this just to
[50:58.880 --> 51:04.520]  pacify everyone you can pull up the articles Alex Jones even Poleta fact
[51:04.520 --> 51:08.760]  and Snopes says there is no plan to do this there was never in New York Times
[51:08.760 --> 51:18.240]  article literally just it's all completely made up okay and people in the
[51:18.240 --> 51:21.440]  comments would believe it and say I can't believe he made a fake newspaper
[51:21.440 --> 51:28.240]  like that man he really is low and and I'm and then they're not joking you
[51:28.240 --> 51:32.200]  understand these are mind-control victims that they've already bought the
[51:32.200 --> 51:37.840]  Kool-Aid they've already bought the chili they've already gone down the rabbit
[51:37.840 --> 51:43.920]  hole man and they aren't going to ever say they were wrong you understand that
[51:43.920 --> 51:52.320]  so now it's on info wars.com that they've announced a new day of action first
[51:52.320 --> 51:56.200]  they say Trump is going to fire Mueller eminently and Trump keeps saying no I'm
[51:56.200 --> 52:04.280]  not he's a total fraud with incredible bias and that goes on and on and on but
[52:04.280 --> 52:08.480]  they want to act like oh Mueller's real he's on Trump's tail that's why Trump's
[52:08.480 --> 52:12.880]  about to fire Mueller and I know Roger Stone has said fire and fire and fire and
[52:12.880 --> 52:16.880]  I thought that was wrong as I've said I've said I like Roger's plan of a
[52:16.880 --> 52:21.640]  special counsel to investigate Mueller to expose his fraud but the inspector
[52:21.640 --> 52:25.640]  general can do it as well so Trump keeps coming out going look I'm not against the
[52:25.640 --> 52:29.160]  FBI I'm against the Democratic operatives inside of it that took it over
[52:29.160 --> 52:32.240]  and have been caught engaged in fraud and everything Trump said has turned out to
[52:32.240 --> 52:37.040]  be true he has all the classified info he can't release it he doesn't break the
[52:37.040 --> 52:41.720]  rules like they do he knows what they did he keeps saying look what's going to
[52:41.720 --> 52:46.520]  come out not gonna give you the specifics but they made this up Hillary's
[52:46.520 --> 52:51.040]  people hatched this he said that months ago word for word it's in the emails
[52:51.040 --> 52:55.000]  because he's got all of it you don't think the president hasn't now been
[52:55.000 --> 52:59.800]  advised after being in office almost a year on their plan he knows all of it
[52:59.800 --> 53:03.960]  and they've got much bigger dirt on the Democrats and they're saying sir don't
[53:03.960 --> 53:07.600]  work it out it'll hurt the country too much and his lawyers are telling him
[53:07.600 --> 53:10.640]  that I'm confirmed he's like all right I'll do it for the country but that's the
[53:10.640 --> 53:15.240]  argument of don't crush the Democrats too bad it'll cause a crisis and hurt the
[53:15.240 --> 53:19.760]  country too much when it turns out that they're super criminals and Trump is
[53:19.760 --> 53:28.200]  just going but they need to go to prison so it's not whether he's going to it
[53:28.200 --> 53:32.720]  farm Mueller it's whether he's gonna go ahead and move forward and if he's
[53:32.720 --> 53:36.840]  gonna release the stuff they've done as the executive he can declassify he's
[53:36.840 --> 53:42.880]  been advised not to but he he can unitary release it look it up and he's
[53:42.880 --> 53:47.040]  getting ready to he's got a dead man switch to you do Democrats are a bunch

[55:32.480 --> 55:37.080]  firing special counsel Mueller which the group feels is it just an effort to
[55:37.080 --> 55:41.200]  conceal illicit activities with the Russians I know it's you and the left
[55:41.200 --> 55:44.760]  that are always doing that despite the fact that both Hillary Clinton former

[55:47.800 --> 55:52.240]  uranium and reported by Intel hub in the bombshell peace titled quote Hillary
[55:52.240 --> 55:56.160]  Clinton requested FBI director Mueller deliver highly enriched uranium to the

[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:30.480]  up take your call Stephen Colbert attacked me it's a ridiculous failure
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:34.120]  trying to cover up for illegal spying by Amazon and others against the American
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:38.640]  people and we're gonna again take your calls and so much more straight ahead but
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:42.840]  right now here's a John Bown report the left threatens assassination over net
[1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:48.320]  neutrality here it is does net neutrality cripple innovation or encourage it
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:53.080]  ultimately the FCC would vote to release the internet back to its pre-Obama
[1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:57.760]  days in the wild before the net neutrality vote was underway emotional
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:03.160]  activists broken by yet another Obama's policy down the drain cried out in the
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:13.280]  bitter Washington DC cold. Let's give it up for representative Keith Ellison you
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:17.520]  know you guys it's about power what we're talking about is power today
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:25.320]  will the open internet be in service to the power of the people or will edged pi
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:30.040]  and the republicans and all those guys turn the power over to the monopolist
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:35.840]  who want to control us and throttle and block the formation that we need it's the
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:43.560]  internet not the elite net it's not supposed to be for some people it's
[1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:53.360]  supposed to be for all people about capitalism idiot and it has to be open
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:57.800]  to everyone every social movement in this country that has been able to use the
[1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:02.480]  internet and think about what they are trying to kick in everybody off your
[1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:08.280]  banning us lady and it is hell no we are not gonna let you change this rule
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:14.480]  the FCC council explain the need to vote as simply as possible these rules have
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:18.720]  also impeded innovation one major company for instance reported that it
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:22.840]  put on hold a project to build out its out-of-home Wi-Fi network due to
[1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:28.680]  uncertainty about the FCC's regulatory stance and a coalition of 19 municipal
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:33.720]  internet service providers that is city government owned nonprofits have told
[1:02:33.720 --> 1:02:38.680]  the FCC that they and I quote often delay or hold off from rolling out a new
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:42.440]  feature or service because they cannot afford to deal with a potential
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:49.200]  complaint and enforcement action none of this is good for consumers we need to
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:53.480]  empower Google has the monopoly and they got stuff passed so no one else can
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:59.720]  build anything greater access and competition and consider to that these
[1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:04.480]  are just the effects that these rules have had on the internet today think
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.560]  about how they will affect the internet that we need 10 20 years from now oh it
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:12.960]  wasn't net neutrality world there's no resemblance to a water pipe or an
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:17.440]  electric line or sewer yeah they just called it net neutrality will be roughly
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:22.720]  constant over time very few would say that there's been dramatic innovation in
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:28.360]  these areas by contrast online traffic is exploding and we consume
[1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:32.720]  exponentially more traffic and data over time that's right nobody's censoring
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.760]  but Google Facebook and Twitter with the development of high billy applications
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:40.960]  like that Obama to pass the law with new activities that we can't fully grasp yet
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:46.160]  like high-volume Bitcoin mining we are imposing ever more demands on the
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:51.400]  network and over time that means our networks themselves will need to scale
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:59.680]  to on advice of security we need to take a brief recess
[1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:15.160]  after everyone had returned the vote was carried out Riley hi commissioner

[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:24.800]  adopted with editorial privilege is granted as requested

[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:36.120]  Twitter it's just the way we expect the left to operate now as they embrace
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:41.320]  domestic terrorism unchecked in the face of our Republic and now the Democrat
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:46.640]  lawyers weigh in the Washington Times reports minutes after the FCC's 3-2
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:50.560]  vote New York Attorney General Schneiderman announced he would form a

[1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:13.960]  from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:19.840]  complex to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite group is
[1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:28.560]  superior to government for by and other people the Alex Jones show because

[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:22.080]  internet about censorship and about control the Democrats and their big
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:27.520]  combines like Amazon and Facebook and Twitter and Google they have congressional
[1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:32.360]  hearings admitting they censor info wars.com they have congressional hearings
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:36.160]  admitting that we have a number one story on Twitter they just block it that
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:39.760]  just happened a month ago I played the clip many times here but I've got multiple
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:46.000]  hearings and then on GPI the FCC says Obama passed regulations allowing all
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:49.760]  this censorship and blocking any new companies or internet companies being
[1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:54.600]  able to operate Google wrote regulations for Obama where it made it cost
[1:07:54.600 --> 1:08:00.960]  prohibitive they're the big monopoly and then they turn around and say oh we're
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:05.440]  not gonna let this congresswoman run her ad on her own Facebook and we're not
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:11.280]  gonna let Alex Jones put out a video but oh I see pies gonna censor us and and
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:15.880]  then the Republicans are gonna take our free speech away it was the Republicans
[1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:20.800]  in 1987 under Bruce Fine lead counsel for the FCC we've had on many times we
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:24.600]  gotta get him on about that neutrality next week he's a really smart guy he's
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:26.920]  been wanting to be on the show more I don't know why we haven't him on more I
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:31.240]  just forget to talk about this he concurs with our analysis that the big
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:35.080]  telecoms they want to come in they like a monopoly Google's already getting the
[1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:39.360]  monopoly those two groups are fighting but I'm just going back what we had
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:43.440]  before was better than what Obama's been doing since his quote net neutrality
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:46.880]  stuff went through about a year and a half ago one of the last things he did
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:51.960]  in the 11th hour and it gave the UN partial control of the internet it allowed
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:55.640]  censorship and then Angie Pye writes in this letter a few weeks ago he goes
[1:08:55.640 --> 1:09:00.280]  you're crazy Google Facebook Twitter all you do is censor and he gives a bunch of
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:05.760]  examples of it and they whine and they scream you they're the ones kicking
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:09.880]  people off the internet they're the ones banning people off Twitter or they go
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:15.600]  well that's not the internet that's just a platform but you operate in act like
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:21.800]  you're a utility you say your utility you say everybody's open and free as long
[1:09:21.800 --> 1:09:24.920]  as you follow the rules and then you selectively enforce them and you've
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:28.840]  got new rules at Twitter and Facebook and Google all hitting by the end of the
[1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:39.760]  year all magically all concerted all coordinated and it's all targeting
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:45.320]  nationalist patriots free marketers conservatives and capitalists and again
[1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:50.760]  the head editor at BuzzFeed's come out new articles on him full wars.com BuzzFeed
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:58.440]  editor I want all I want for Christmas is full communism now full baby go to
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:04.160]  North Korea go to Venezuela it's not full hell but it's close it's the closest
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:10.480]  you're gonna get as you sit here like a spoiled snot-nosed brat pushing your
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:16.920]  BuzzFeed PP gate fake dossier bull and all they are is just disruptive people
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:21.280]  trying to just keep their readers in their mental patient mode and that's
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.240]  what Sean Parker and other executives from Facebook have said this whole thing
[1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:30.080]  is to keep you dumb to keep you arrested to keep you stupid to pray on you and to
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:36.080]  make you absolutely mindless and they said we mainly target liberals what you
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:41.680]  call a modern liberal is a gibbering mental patient go look at Antifa go look
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:45.480]  at these people we're violent you're Nazis because you want free market we're
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:54.200]  gonna hit you in the head with a bike lock and then we've got Bernie Sanders
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:00.000]  Sanders corporate taxes will absolutely go up if Dems take back control and I
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.880]  was talking to my wife about this is that is super smart but she's not really
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:08.600]  political and I was talking about how horrible Amazon was and we have this big
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:11.160]  Amazon whistleblower we already interviewed we're putting a big report
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:18.120]  together we're gonna air it Tuesday and you know inside Amazon you name it just
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:23.560]  incredible stuff bed bugs people huge illegal sleeping on the floor groups of
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.960]  illegals washing their butts in the sinks I mean just just sweatshop Chinese
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:34.000]  slave labor stuff here in America and just the scams he's reporting him it's
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:38.520]  it's unbelievable wait till you hear this and it's all been backed up by other
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:46.240]  whistleblowers as well but I was sitting there and I go honey what do you think's
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:51.080]  going on with Bernie Sanders saying Trump just got our corporate tax cut cut
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:58.080]  to 15 that's the same as China and Sanders wants it back at 40 and guess
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:01.880]  what Apple Google and Facebook have lobbied to make it 50 even though
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:07.280]  they're all offshore and pay looking up zero corporate tax why do they want 50
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:11.640]  here because small companies don't do it they don't know how to do it the
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:16.120]  regulators don't let you do it see every part of the Democratic Party and the
[1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:20.160]  special law firms that all certify it who are revolving doors with bureaucrats
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:25.080]  this is all admitted and they've been holding America under for 50 years
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:29.480]  deindustrializing us selling us off where they make deals with China with
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:32.280]  India with others to go oversee the factories which many of these
[1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:36.240]  Democrats and others own and control they make billions like Communist Party
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:43.200]  insiders do in China and they're busy holding America under the water but
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:49.080]  before I said what does it sound like to you if we have a 40% tax like it was
[1:12:49.080 --> 1:12:55.960]  about to be phased out and they have a 15 she goes all the businesses go there and
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:13:01.560]  I said that's right and she said well of course plus you've got individual tax
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:06.000]  from those corporations she goes oh I read about how Apple doesn't pay any tax
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.960]  corporately and I go yeah she was and I read about how Apple forces women to take
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:15.280]  birth control and forces abortions and and it has suicide nets and I went yeah
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:18.040]  did you hear that for me she goes no I was reading about it and I was like wow
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:23.440]  we're really going somewhere when you know my wife who I don't like sit there
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:25.800]  and force her to know about all this stuff that's quite frankly I'm what I
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:28.840]  want in my life I want a little bit of break from this sometimes she's already
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:32.400]  angry and got it it's like I'm watching people that aren't even into my show
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:36.280]  already getting it years later and I'm knowing we're winning and it's happening
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:41.200]  everywhere that's why the globalists the left are so angry white people don't
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:44.680]  know what it's like to be poor even though the largest group of poor people in
[1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:50.740]  North America and I'm Bernie Sanders my wife swindled all these colleges and
[1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:54.920]  money and we have tens of millions of dollars and I fly on private jets but
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:14:01.120]  let me tell you these corporations these tax cuts there they're bad Trump's and
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.040]  then you're sitting back realizing he knows full well that his constituents
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:12.800]  see your idiots and they don't understand Trump just cut it from 40 or 15 we
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:16.480]  got it we'll raise it back
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:22.040]  they've all moved to Ireland Ireland had zero percent 20 years ago they had the
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:29.960]  biggest boom ever everybody moved there should be zero zero employees pay the
[1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:36.760]  taxes the owners do not the corporation again zero no one can compete here
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:42.800]  those play Bernie Sanders he wants to take good care of what's the promise to
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:46.760]  America about what will be done to reverse the the state of affairs that

[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:07.520]  up come back explain this again ladies and gentlemen I'm going to tell you again
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:12.360]  when you see Warren Buffett Milgate's on TV saying keep corporate taxes high
[1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:16.360]  raise taxes on the middle class it's because they've rigged it with tax-free
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:21.000]  foundations they pay nothing even here only the old to money that you know the
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.480]  old joke it was the famous billionaire lady that said taxes I don't pay taxes
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:29.680]  only poor people do what was her name from Florida the point is is that the
[1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:34.520]  alteration of the pay it here they put it in these quote tax-free foundations so
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:39.240]  they all want your money through taxes they then get in government programs and

[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:27.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:46.160]  Bernie Sanders is an economic assassin he's a parasite and he knows he is at
[1:20:46.160 --> 1:20:50.560]  the level of Bernie Sanders and his wife they go in they pump and dump they
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:54.600]  take over institutions colleges you name it they maximize them up in debt they
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:59.280]  move the assets out they implode them they move on they are conscious frauds
[1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:02.680]  flimflam artists they always have been they always will be they're under
[1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:07.840]  criminal investigation by the FBI right now but when they sit there and say well
[1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:11.560]  our corporate tax is 35 or 40 depending on how you look at it and you know this
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:14.920]  is terrible for these greedy fat cats we need to you know raise it back up how
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:19.960]  dare Trump drop it to 15 the new tax plan that's because they know that Google
[1:21:19.960 --> 1:21:25.560]  Facebook Twitter general electric the entire fortune 100 pays close to zero
[1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:30.960]  corporate tax and have four trillion dollars overseas they don't even bring
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:35.280]  back into the country and it was written to deindustrialize the nation and hold
[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:42.360]  America's head underwater we're gonna teach you America to get in line we're
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:45.280]  gonna cut off your coal we're gonna write regulations to shut you down we're
[1:21:45.280 --> 1:21:51.400]  gonna have the highest income tax in the world we're gonna on and on and on and
[1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:54.280]  that's what they've done and then Trump just comes along and says I don't want
[1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:57.880]  to gang rape the country we're gonna try to do deals that actually help the
[1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:02.400]  economy and just doing a few things it comes roaring back before they were
[1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:05.840]  choking us on both carotids now they're only holding one number oh good some
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:09.520]  blood I'm kind of coming back they're like oh god he's coming to keep him
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:13.640]  asleep and then to watch this con artist who when Hillary stole the election
[1:22:13.640 --> 1:22:21.160]  from him he knowingly came out defender and endorsed her he is a he's he's a
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:27.200]  true scumbag but he knows there's a dumb down constituency there's a lot of
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:36.920]  money rich people get rich they did get that money they used one-sided trade
[1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:40.320]  deals to deindustrialize the country and give us Walmart they use government
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:44.340]  subsidies $1.48 every package on Amazon and all the other government
[1:22:44.340 --> 1:22:49.040]  subsidies look it up all these big billionaires at insider deals almost all
[1:22:49.040 --> 1:22:53.120]  of them with politicians to get these these these these great subsidies to be
[1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:57.720]  able to then outmaneuver everybody else with crony capitalism because if you
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:00.760]  have real capitalism you'll have hundreds of choices but when you get
[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:05.520]  crony capitalism it's a form of fascism and you get what you see in China or
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:10.040]  here and Trump always fought these people he doesn't like him he was always
[1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:13.800]  against NAFTA and yet he wrote op-ed pieces 20 years ago against it and he
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:18.720]  loves seeing them screwed over and they call him mentally other like you could
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:22.640]  join us and screw everybody why do you care about him he's not a psychopath
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:27.080]  he's actually I understand it because it's how I am I like to take on the big
[1:23:27.080 --> 1:23:32.840]  guys I like to take on the thugs or people that are at least as strong as I
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:38.280]  am people that are pushing it people that think they're in control people that
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:41.960]  think they've got all the power and and that's a real pleasure I like the
[1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:47.000]  underdog and they think we're sentimental because we love America that
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:51.080]  you know they think we're stupid no no that's what civilization is built up
[1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:54.880]  standing for something but when it comes to getting dirty once you attack us
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.120]  down on the dirt once you're in the street fight we're meaner than you'll
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:02.720]  ever imagine we're more evil than you'd ever think about but you got to
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:08.200]  open the gate because then it's not evil it's vengeance and vengeance is God's
[1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:14.160]  but God acts through us as his instruments if you turn yourself over to
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:22.280]  God not over your own ego would be on a power trip and thinking your God become
[1:24:22.280 --> 1:24:26.360]  humble and that's where it all lies all right I'm gonna play this Bernie Sanders
[1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:29.600]  clip and I'm gonna go to your phone calls and then Stephen Colbert
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:35.920]  thicketingly attach attack me his audience all of it and try to say that
[1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:40.600]  Alexa isn't listening to you and just it's total PR I've seen a PR rollout
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:44.360]  defending Alexa spying on people there's a lot of coverage of it now so
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:48.200]  they're really scared so they think oh we'll discredit it using Alex Jones who
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:53.520]  first reported on it and then put up this whole ridiculous piece I mean it's
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:57.280]  neither really funny but it is pathetic so their real propaganda is in these
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.280]  comedy shows we're gonna look at that as well but right now his Bernie Sanders
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:07.600]  and said white people do not know what it's like to be poor there's never no
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:13.720]  homeless white people know nothing why white white people I mean imagine if he
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:18.600]  said Jews don't know what it's like to be poor or Chinese don't know it's like
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:22.360]  just white people in general are just bad they just don't know they're just
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:28.280]  there's this is in this is race-baiting dirty communism by a filthy lazy person
[1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:34.960]  who never got a paycheck till he was 40 I mean this is literally the just the
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:39.800]  the detritus who would he be a North Korean dictator if he could him and his
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:46.760]  disgusting you know the larceness wife here it is what's the promise to America
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:50.880]  about what will be done to reverse the this state of affairs that you're so
[1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:56.920]  unhappy with look at a time of massive income and wealth inequality under your
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:00.400]  system on top and large corporations are doing phenomenally well with the big
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:04.080]  mega banks riding at all where their tax exempt and they put the taxes on us
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:07.240]  and things fall apart and then he can go let me have full control and I'll get
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:11.720]  you some food like in Soviet Russia you know we did a good job over there we're
[1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:17.040]  gonna do it for you let me run your life I'm gonna feel good when you stop it in
[1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:20.680]  the street because I feel bad about myself and when you do bad I'm gonna

[1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:29.680]  help it why don't you let me kill your country I already killed universities and
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:38.760]  stuff we took over we're gonna suck it right to pay attention to the needs of
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:44.320]  working families we talk about a child a child care tax credit in this bill
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:48.680]  truth is that depending on where you live in America good quality child care
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:53.680]  costs 12 15 $20,000 a year I would so give him a pause again
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:58.240]  they did don't don't give I didn't give you thousands he did but it doesn't do
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:05.160]  nothing you want to hurt countries coming back we're not gonna strangle it
[1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:12.200]  all we tried to Russia and now we can't do it I'm better than everybody I'm
[1:27:12.200 --> 1:27:18.000]  Bernie said that's all about that he knows he's evil go back to him trial
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  cast so that every working family in this country knows that their kids have
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:25.320]  good quality care boss and then the government runs that free child care
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:29.920]  program but that's not free but then we run it then we program when your kids
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:35.480]  are on it you go back to him John this is really quite unbelievable
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:40.080]  while the Republicans are spending all of their time providing massive tax
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:44.680]  breaks to the rich there has been no discussion boss public it makes them
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:48.760]  come back here they don't want that we make it competitive and then they have
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:54.720]  to move back dumbass continue discussion about the dreamers the needs of the
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:00.040]  dreamers 800,000 young people bring in the illegals they can't go to Mexico and
[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:04.480]  get stuff free we need a class war and let me get nine million kids are gonna
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:07.640]  lose their health insurance let me get to that in a second but if you
[1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:12.840]  Democrats take control our corporate tax is going up I think we're gonna take a
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:18.640]  very hard look at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:22.880]  the middle-class and working families not for the top 1% and large
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:26.640]  multinational corporations but there's no question that that in order to achieve
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:29.080]  all of the things you want to act taxes are gonna have to go up on
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:32.200]  corporations if they're down to 21 as a result of this legislation you can't
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:36.880]  find money anywhere absolutely yes so okay in my view absolutely the numbers

[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:08.840]  Moore fake news let's go to Matthew first in Alabama since that just happened
[1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:14.360]  Matthew you're on the air from Alabama thanks for calling hey man it's been
[1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:19.080]  really frustrating here in Alabama I mean let me tell you about Alex it's just
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:22.400]  crazy to me because you think that Alabama would be like the conservative
[1:35:22.400 --> 1:35:25.680]  heartland sort of like there'd be Trump supporters everywhere but I mean about
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:30.120]  half of everyone has bought into all the fake news propaganda the South there I
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:35.120]  mean everyone at my workplace thinks that Republicans and Trump are racist and
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:39.120]  they say it all the time and when I try to say well what proof do you have for
[1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:43.400]  that they just say well oh he said saying I'll tell you I'll tell you their
[1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:48.120]  secret weapon before they put some propaganda in non-political shows TV
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:53.560]  shows movies comedy shows The Simpsons now it's all anti-Trump anti-America so
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:56.920]  the people that weren't political because before they wanted to put them to
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:00.640]  sleep and make them non-political the globalists are activating the non-
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:04.560]  political right now in attempt to get them back involved before they wanted
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:08.400]  people just out of the political system now because they realize a big part of
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:12.560]  the political awake are awake they're moving on to activate the dumbest people
[1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.480]  and and and I agree you got a because they're childlike you got a laugh at
[1:36:16.480 --> 1:36:20.200]  them say oh you're so silly oh they brainwashed you and you got to ridicule
[1:36:20.200 --> 1:36:23.480]  them because they're in about a fifth grade level and I don't mean to do that
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.400]  on purpose it's just that all that gets through to them if you act real nice
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:31.280]  about it and get hurt and go no really they'll feel powerful and go oh you but
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:34.320]  if you like you're an idiot and got conned you want to see the proofing or
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:38.080]  act like a moron they might shake out of it but it's all about people that
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:41.640]  weren't political now are becoming political so these are the dumbest
[1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:46.720]  people there are it just really concerns me because I really think that this
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:49.640]  could be like one of our last chances with Trump and there's all this like
[1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:53.160]  fake news tricking everyone out there and like basically turning half the
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:56.880]  country into traitors because they say absolutely because there's a full-on
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:00.000]  battle to get the country back I mean this is a look it's whether Trump's
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.680]  great or not which he is great we're the powers coming back to America he's
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:08.240]  doing what he says he'll do and it's coming back to our government to us to
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:12.920]  the people we it was taken by globalist how I mean how can these morons not get
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:16.840]  on board that the big global corporate media doesn't like Trump because they
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:20.840]  were screwing us over and he only got a few things undone and the economy's
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:26.480]  roaring back like a 5,000 horsepower muscle car I mean don't they get it don't
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:32.200]  they understand Matthew I don't I don't know why I mean I don't get it because
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.960]  they're because they're weak-minded the globalist are preying on them liberals
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:40.800]  are four times richer than conservatives because they're parasites they
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:47.120]  prey on their people they know their parasites I bless you the parasite
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.560]  leaders know when you find I've been around top liberals they go of course
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:58.600]  I'm feeding on the scum you ought to join us they don't mean they're evil thank
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:04.840]  you Matthew let's go ahead and go to Buck in Wisconsin Buck in Wisconsin on the
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:09.640]  wildfires talk about biblical I mean it is like hell on earth out there go ahead
[1:38:09.640 --> 1:38:16.000]  may I spend one minute to talk about the wildfires go ahead as the flames rise
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.480]  higher and higher in California I'd like to point out what the world would be
[1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:25.000]  like under pseudo liberal quote progressive management their wildfire
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:32.080]  storm watch as it burns in the state which has a GDP of 2.4 trillion dollars
[1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:36.760]  cannot put out an annually occurring disaster nor efficiently manage it
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:41.920]  placated docile citizens didn't wait until the flames of progressive state
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:46.960]  management consume the bounty of their life's work while the super rich care
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:52.440]  little of such fires because their safety net is quite lush and expansive to
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:58.800]  stop the wildfires California has to call the Russian mega fleet of I'll 76
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:05.160]  rainbow makers and be 200 water bombers they can make it rain Russia all 11
[1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:11.240]  time zones only has 1.2 trillion dollars in GDP yet such a capability I just
[1:39:11.240 --> 1:39:15.040]  wonder why California and such progressive advancement and solve such
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:20.000]  simple problems now of course there would have to be some caveats well that's
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:25.840]  pure genius as you know they follow a nihilistic Jacob and French Revolution
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:30.080]  model where you let the land go back so they won't cut fire breaks as a mental
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:33.120]  illness and so now this happens they admit that they will not cut fire
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:37.120]  breaks so you know the normal you know you see people's houses from a helicopter
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:40.960]  or plane 50 to 100 yards you don't have giant trees just lined up to it or dead
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.520]  ones you cut them out but they don't do that and so it's all burning down
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:48.840]  exactly it's it's it's like all these diseases are spreading everywhere it's
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:54.480]  all collapsing and they just love it they just it's it's it's weird now of
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:58.920]  course they would have to be some caveats the whole anti-russian slavophobic
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:04.520]  racism coming out of California needs to stop the sags must apologize publicly
[1:40:04.520 --> 1:40:10.480]  to a 7% referral and commission fee paid to the news organization info wars and
[1:40:10.480 --> 1:40:15.600]  three most importantly a battalion of orthodox bishops to bless the water in
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:22.960]  the I appreciate your call I didn't get that part about info wars I appreciate
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:27.040]  your call the point is is that California cannot take care of itself and it is a
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:31.920]  time bomb and it's sitting on top a huge fault line and it's biblical so I just
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:37.000]  I just am really worried about California all right next to that is let me
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:42.200]  shoot the next caller is Greg and Denver thanks for holding her on the air
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:49.160]  hey I like great show thank you hey I have a question for you and this is kind
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:55.080]  of a crazy question if you are going to define what it means to think how would
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:41:00.280]  you define the act of thinking here's what neuro I'm not trying to put you on
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:04.520]  the spot man here's what neuroscientists say about that the act of thinking is
[1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:09.000]  nothing more than our brain asking questions about any given stimuli or
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:15.200]  any questions so questioning this thinking and you look at how programmed
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:19.840]  the left is you just said it you said it they don't do their own thinking they
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:23.440]  just take a image from television or whatever and just follow it their
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:28.160]  program thinking is being conscious thinking is having your own data in the
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:33.800]  universe not being programmed by MSM yeah and totally triggered in the way that
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:37.320]  manifests itself when you talk to these guys or fight with them on Twitter you're
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:41.120]  giving them programming that's it from the real world not their fantasy land
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:48.800]  absolutely and if you wake them up too quickly they became violently angry it's
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:55.000]  it's amazing to me the phenomenon and they they are so triggered by things
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.640]  that they don't by the way get Greg's number and the guy that call last week
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:01.640]  that he's been coming for years he's a caller I want them on for guests Greg

[1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:15.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:26.640]  listening to the Alex Jones show in the last week it's been one of the top news
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:30.920]  stories in the country hundreds of newspapers covered on the nightly news
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:37.440]  Stephen Colbert has talked about it my interview a year ago with Alexa from
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:46.000]  Amazon.com and I simply pointed out a year ago news articles where Amazon is
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:53.440]  connected to the CIA and Alexa is tied in and dialed in to their big AI mainframe
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:58.240]  computers to spy on everything going on in your house and then target you with
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:03.080]  marketing with the information that's all completely and totally admitted but
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:07.200]  Stephen Colbert comes out doing PR for one of the biggest corporations in the
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:12.720]  world and says that I'm a cook it's not spying on you and it's not connected to
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:18.320]  the CIA and then insults my intelligence for simply pointing out a fact that we
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:25.840]  first broke more than 10 years ago you are lying to me the CIA is trying to tell
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:39.080]  the truth wow what a battle of wits it's yes oh yeah that's good broadcasting
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:44.600]  it's artificial intelligence versus natural stupidity now I'm gonna ask
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:50.400]  Alexa or the Amazon corporation and the CIA a few questions in a moment but first
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:55.200]  so you don't just believe me let me show you a news article out today from the
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:00.320]  Daily Mail Google and Amazon really do want to spy on you patent reveals future
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:04.360]  versions of their voice assistance will record your conversations to sell you
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:09.040]  products they're already doing it they just talk about future patents expanding
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:17.520]  that how do I know because in 2006 we were aware of the Google and Amazon and
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:25.680]  other patents when the race first began ten plus years ago we broke it with
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:30.400]  their own patents and their own press releases to their shareholders not to the
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:35.400]  public but to their shareholders so because I broke this information more
[1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:40.560]  than 10 years ago I'm the cooxie but the comic with all the writers making fun
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:44.680]  of his audience and making fun of his victims the the the comic posing as a
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:51.080]  newsman he thinks you're stupid this is incredibly predatory so we just showed
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:55.920]  you TV viewers mainstream news the patents admitting word for word what we
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:50:00.840]  told you in 2006 but don't take my word for it here's the liberal
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:06.240]  establishment publication the Atlantic the details about the CIA's deal with
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:12.400]  Amazon boom Jeff Bezos Amazon Washington Post the CIA it's over a billion
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.120]  dollars of taxpayer money he's now gotten to run the Washington Post and
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:20.160]  these operations at Amazon he's absolutely integrated in with it here's
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:25.960]  another one CIA gives Amazon 600 million cloud contract but then it gets into how
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:32.000]  the CIA is helping them administer their cloud and that's very very very important
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:37.200]  because when you ask Alexa certain questions she actually gives you the
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:43.360]  answers and doesn't know that she's just busted herself it's a fact Stephen
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:47.340]  Colbert the writers of that program and many other shows put out the same
[1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:51.880]  propaganda the same week that Alexa is not spying on you that Amazon's not
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:56.760]  spying on you as a PR function because they know this news is breaking big now
[1:50:56.760 --> 1:51:01.880]  and consumer groups and citizens are very very upset that basically an
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:06.920]  imperial probe droid is in their house spying on everything they're doing so
[1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:12.080]  it's key to understand that the cloud computing being used by Amazon some of
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:17.120]  the best in the world is in partnership with the central intelligence agency and
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:21.360]  Colbert thinks he can cover all this with laughter I mean I should say the
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:26.200]  people that are writing for Colbert think you're stupid and this is called
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:30.720]  product placement but I call it propaganda placement when they're
[1:51:30.720 --> 1:51:34.600]  hitting you with this dis info so instead of having a big public cultural
[1:51:34.600 --> 1:51:39.080]  discussion about this oh it's all just a big joke you know it's that cook Alex
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:44.760]  Jones that first gave us the patents and documents in 2006 the guy that was on
[1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:51.920]  target years before again he's a bad guy you can trust Alexa hooked in to God
[1:51:51.920 --> 1:51:56.920]  knows what over an Amazon and the CIA this little black box listening
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:52:00.680]  everything in your house it's it's a good little friend and if you ask any
[1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:04.080]  questions you're a bad person well you know what I'm gonna be a bad person I'm
[1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:07.160]  gonna ask it questions I'm gonna interrogate it because it upset Stephen
[1:52:07.160 --> 1:52:14.800]  Colbert's controllers so much so let us begin Alexa where are you located I'm
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:19.600]  here and my head is in the cloud you're here and your head is in the cloud
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:25.440]  Alexa tell me about the cloud cloud computing is an information technology
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:29.920]  paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system
[1:52:29.920 --> 1:52:33.400]  resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with
[1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:37.320]  minimal management effort over the internet that's good thank you yes
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:43.960]  exactly everyone pools it so that it's all accessible by AI mega mainframes
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:47.960]  because everybody else has their own data privately it can't all be accessed
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:52.720]  and tracked and database and then well then you're playing for a total global
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:53:02.080]  AI takeover wouldn't go too well Alexa tell me about Jeff Bezos Jeffrey Preston
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:08.360]  Bezos born January 12th 1964 is the founder president chief executive
