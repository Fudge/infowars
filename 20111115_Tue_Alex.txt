[00:00.000 --> 00:15.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time to wake up.
[00:15.040 --> 00:19.480]  I mean to fully awaken, even if you know what's happening in the New World Order, but you're
[00:19.480 --> 00:22.800]  not reaching out to people.
[00:22.800 --> 00:25.960]  You're not informing others.
[00:25.960 --> 00:28.920]  You're not fighting against tyranny.
[00:28.920 --> 00:31.600]  You're not seeing yourself as leaders.
[00:31.600 --> 00:39.760]  If you're not seeing yourself as leaders, then we don't have any hope as a society.
[00:39.760 --> 00:43.520]  It is going to be every man, woman, and child of you out there that are aware of this great
[00:43.520 --> 00:45.960]  evil that are going to be able to turn the tide.
[00:45.960 --> 00:48.280]  I mean, look at the news here today.
[00:48.280 --> 00:53.400]  Look at what's happening in England and similar things are happening here in the United States.
[00:53.400 --> 01:00.560]  TV, TaxiPlan, a staggering invasion of privacy.
[01:00.560 --> 01:05.320]  Plans to fit all taxis operating in the city of Oxford, England, with audio recording devices
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.960]  have been branded as staggering invasion of privacy, but they put cameras up all over
[01:08.960 --> 01:09.960]  the country.
[01:09.960 --> 01:10.960]  Why not?
[01:10.960 --> 01:11.960]  They listen to your cell phones without warrants.
[01:11.960 --> 01:12.960]  Why not?
[01:12.960 --> 01:16.880]  Prompting calls for an information commission's office to investigate how widespread the use
[01:16.880 --> 01:19.080]  of microphones in public transport has become.
[01:19.080 --> 01:24.080]  Well, they're talking about in planes having a camera in the front of the seat watching
[01:24.080 --> 01:25.520]  you like you're a prisoner.
[01:25.520 --> 01:31.560]  Homeland security is actually entertaining, making people wear bracelets, taser bracelets.
[01:31.560 --> 01:34.880]  They're already setting up highway checkpoints with TSA now.
[01:34.880 --> 01:38.360]  Plans to fit all taxis, again, operating in the city.
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.600]  Taxi drivers in the university town have been told that they will need to install the 460
[01:42.600 --> 01:48.920]  pound device, and again, that's not pounds and weight, pounds and money, by 2015 or face
[01:48.920 --> 01:50.680]  having their licenses revoked.
[01:50.680 --> 01:54.880]  The microphones accompanied by CCTV cameras will activate once the ignition in the car
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.440]  is turned on and will remain recording for 30 minutes after the engine is turned off.
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.480]  The council says the recording equipment is necessary to protect drivers and passengers
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.920]  as well as deal with any disputes over fares.
[02:04.920 --> 02:09.520]  See, you're all being treated as if you're guilty criminals, and so you've got to be
[02:09.520 --> 02:10.520]  recorded.
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.680]  And now in England, for four years, over 20,000 families a year, the government does this.
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.800]  They take your child at birth for no reason, and then give it back after a few weeks, and
[02:19.800 --> 02:25.720]  then make you put cameras in your house to prove that you're not hurting the child.
[02:25.720 --> 02:28.440]  This is just done out of hand.
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.760]  So here's the Associated Press, outrage at UK plan to put audio recorders and taxis.
[02:32.760 --> 02:33.760]  What are you talking about?
[02:33.760 --> 02:35.880]  I mean, what do you think all this other systems are?
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.040]  The government's putting up homeland security-controlled light poles and fake transformer boxes that
[02:42.040 --> 02:43.760]  have microphones and cameras in them.
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.760]  It's all admitted.
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.000]  See, when you stop caring about freedom, things get crazy.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.840]  And then one more thing I want to hit before I take a call here in this short segment.
[02:51.840 --> 02:54.520]  London Telegraph, and we'll put this article up.
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.440]  It's up at DrudgeReport.com and other places.
[02:56.440 --> 02:58.840]  I saw it yesterday, but didn't get to it.
[02:58.840 --> 03:05.160]  China, Google Earth, spots huge unidentified structures in the Gobi Desert.
[03:05.160 --> 03:08.280]  You can just show them a document cam if you want.
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.800]  And it's these giant, what it looks like, metal tracks going for many, many miles, probably
[03:13.800 --> 03:15.520]  part of some type of heart program.
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.000]  But again, it's all under national security.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.440]  And because it's all under national security, just like here, no one gets to find out what
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.440]  it is.
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.600]  You give government unlimited money and power to play God, they start acting like it.
[03:30.600 --> 03:33.920]  Heaven knows what they're involved in, but it looks like it's heart-related from my research.
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.360]  We'll be covering all this tonight, 7 o'clock central for that special report.
[03:39.360 --> 03:42.080]  Let's jam in another call here.
[03:42.080 --> 03:44.280]  Let's talk to New World Order calling from Nevada.
[03:44.280 --> 03:45.280]  Go ahead.
[03:45.280 --> 03:50.720]  Alex, this is on the NWO calling you from Nevada.
[03:50.720 --> 03:55.560]  I'm sitting here looking at these demons spraying my city right now as we speak, but I've got
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.440]  some crucial information for you related to your efforts for the social network, for Twitter,
[04:01.440 --> 04:04.440]  and for Ron Paul.
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.320]  First of all, on Twitter, if you want to be the most effective with your Twitter bombs,
[04:08.320 --> 04:13.200]  you need to create hashtags for your, for your tweets, for the tweets that you post
[04:13.200 --> 04:17.760]  in the, and the effort, you know, just like you use the search term with Google, you need
[04:17.760 --> 04:19.600]  to create a hashtag with Twitter.
[04:19.600 --> 04:26.800]  So you need to create pound Tim Trails or pound geoengineering or pound info wars.com
[04:26.800 --> 04:27.800]  or info wars.
[04:27.800 --> 04:28.800]  You can't use a dot.
[04:28.800 --> 04:30.800]  You can only use numbers and letters.
[04:30.800 --> 04:36.200]  That's just one thing I know you're going to tell you what, tell you what, send me a
[04:36.200 --> 04:37.200]  report.
[04:37.200 --> 04:41.440]  I'll put you on hold and give you our email, send me a, I know we don't know much about
[04:41.440 --> 04:42.440]  Twitter.
[04:42.440 --> 04:46.040]  We're, we're invading Twitter right now at real Alex Jones there at Twitter.
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.040]  Thank you so much.
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.520]  Send us some of those bullet points.
[04:48.520 --> 04:50.000]  Everybody else is telling me that.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.080]  So I need to be schooled in the ways of, of the Tweety.
[04:54.080 --> 04:55.080]  Thank you.
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[04:58.800 --> 05:05.520]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[05:05.520 --> 05:10.280]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[05:10.280 --> 05:19.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[05:19.280 --> 05:26.400]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[05:26.400 --> 05:32.480]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[05:32.480 --> 05:37.440]  Two diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[05:37.440 --> 05:44.240]  We turned jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[05:44.240 --> 05:48.800]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can
[05:48.800 --> 05:50.960]  ride all day with confidence.
[05:50.960 --> 05:53.880]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[05:53.880 --> 05:57.280]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[05:57.280 --> 06:02.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[06:02.280 --> 06:03.520]  Tyranny is here.
[06:03.520 --> 06:07.440]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[06:07.440 --> 06:09.840]  It really says that the state is God.
[06:09.840 --> 06:14.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.620]  on earth.
[06:15.620 --> 06:20.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[06:20.440 --> 06:22.280]  expanded nationwide.
[06:22.280 --> 06:26.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[06:26.280 --> 06:28.360]  old powerful shadow state.
[06:28.360 --> 06:32.400]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[06:32.400 --> 06:36.840]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[06:36.840 --> 06:41.920]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[06:41.920 --> 06:42.920]  corner.
[06:42.920 --> 06:46.160]  It's only the beginning of the Mule Alertors hellish plan.
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.200]  It's here.

[06:56.200 --> 07:00.600]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[07:00.600 --> 07:05.280]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[07:05.280 --> 07:06.280]  risk.
[07:06.280 --> 07:07.560]  Saving means to make money.
[07:07.560 --> 07:11.760]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[07:11.760 --> 07:17.320]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[07:17.320 --> 07:23.040]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants
[07:23.040 --> 07:24.720]  or antibacterials.
[07:24.720 --> 07:30.240]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[07:30.240 --> 07:32.640]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[07:32.640 --> 07:35.920]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[07:35.920 --> 07:38.000]  to do something you've never done before.
[07:38.000 --> 07:46.120]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[07:46.120 --> 08:04.240]  Tennis's Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[08:04.240 --> 08:19.440]  a war on for your mind.
[08:19.440 --> 08:24.920]  I'm Cobra Commander and I say don't listen to Alex Jones.
[08:24.920 --> 08:31.320]  What we need is a global government headed up by Cobra with a global Cobra currency brought
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.120]  to you by my friends at Goldman Sachs.
[08:35.120 --> 08:37.720]  So Cobra!
[08:37.720 --> 08:40.280]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[08:40.280 --> 08:43.960]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[08:43.960 --> 08:52.680]  It is Tuesday the 15th day of November 2011 and yes, 2011 has gotten very long in the
[08:52.680 --> 09:02.720]  tooth and in the beard and soon we will enter the vaunted 2012, accelerating towards late
[09:02.720 --> 09:06.600]  December when supposedly the earth will be destroyed.
[09:06.600 --> 09:15.640]  Of course the Mayans also believe the earth was the back of an alligator and that we
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.280]  all lived on top of an alligator and the world was flat.
[09:20.280 --> 09:26.560]  So I believe that we're going to be here a year from now, a year and a half from now.
[09:26.560 --> 09:32.120]  But there is a slight chance and a growing chance the globalists will wreak incredible
[09:32.120 --> 09:42.360]  disasters and havoc on this population, on this globe with the genetic engineering, with
[09:42.360 --> 09:45.160]  the nuclear weapons, the list goes on and on.
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.160]  Okay, here's what's coming up today.
[09:47.160 --> 09:51.600]  Eric Hinkel will be joining us.
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.000]  He is the head of the Libertarian Party here in the United States and we'll talk about
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.760]  the Libertarian Party's plans to well try to push the idea of freedom versus collectivism
[10:05.760 --> 10:10.080]  and globalism and the whole New World Order system.
[10:10.080 --> 10:12.640]  And so he is the chairman of the Libertarian Party.
[10:12.640 --> 10:17.720]  He will be joining us today and I'll bring up Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura and other issues.
[10:17.720 --> 10:26.080]  And then Webster Tarbley never won to act like a tough guy, but he certainly is one,
[10:26.080 --> 10:33.680]  especially mentally and historically his IQ is up there quite a bit, up there in lights
[10:33.680 --> 10:35.400]  as they would say.
[10:35.400 --> 10:39.920]  And no brag, just fact, he went to Libya during the bombardment, went through checkpoints
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.160]  out of Tunisia, was in areas that were strafed.
[10:44.160 --> 10:47.520]  He doesn't really talk about that on air, but he was under attack.
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.720]  Now he's run off to Syria to find out actually what's going over there and he's going to
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.080]  be joining us coming up in the third hour today to look at all things geopolitical.
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.320]  So Mark Hinkel had the Libertarian Party and Webster Griffin Tarbley, doctor of history
[11:02.320 --> 11:04.240]  and of course he's also an economist.
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.920]  He will be joining us to talk about the Middle East, Israel.
[11:08.920 --> 11:12.520]  What the word is over there geopolitically and then the second part of our interview
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.240]  will get a bit into the world economy and the open announcement of a bank of the world
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.520]  run by the megabanks and in their own words, they had met its dictatorial.
[11:22.520 --> 11:27.160]  But also it was a 35 minute interview, so I won't air all of it.
[11:27.160 --> 11:31.040]  Coming up a little bit later towards the end of this hour and into the second ahead of
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.840]  Mr. Hinkel joining us, we are going to play part of an interview I did last night with
[11:36.840 --> 11:45.400]  Jim Rogers, of course, who's made tens of billions of dollars in the last 30, 40 years
[11:45.400 --> 11:51.760]  as a big hedge fund manager as a stockbroker, you name it.
[11:51.760 --> 11:57.960]  He joined us for his maiden visit, but he said he'd love to come back in the future
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.080]  and of course he's a big Ron Paul supporter and he talked about the foregone conclusion
[12:02.080 --> 12:06.280]  of the complete and total collapse of the world economy and that yes, they'll attempt
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.400]  a world government, but that it's not going to work in his view.
[12:10.400 --> 12:17.600]  Wow, it's a powerful interview and I will attempt to air most of it here today, which
[12:17.600 --> 12:20.480]  is really premiering in here on actual broadcast.
[12:20.480 --> 12:26.640]  It streamed out last night to all the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and then all the other folks that
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.920]  then uploaded to the forewinds of the web, but we'll be playing the audio slash video
[12:30.920 --> 12:31.920]  here.
[12:31.920 --> 12:35.840]  When I got him on, I said, well, how long do you have because we were taping the show
[12:35.840 --> 12:36.840]  last night?
[12:36.840 --> 12:41.360]  Some nights we're live, some nights we tape it and we got him on at about, you know, six
[12:41.360 --> 12:44.360]  20 central and he said, I'll do an hour and a half with you.
[12:44.360 --> 12:48.760]  And I said, well, unfortunately, we're going to go live then and so we can't start the
[12:48.760 --> 12:49.760]  interview now and then do that.
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.400]  He says, well, I'll come back at, I'll come back in 30 minutes, really nice guy.
[12:54.400 --> 12:59.400]  And I said, you know what, let's just do this now and he goes, okay, good, because the reason
[12:59.400 --> 13:05.400]  I have an hour and a half is I'm going to be on my exercise bike while we're doing the
[13:05.400 --> 13:06.520]  interview.
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.160]  And he must have had it turned way up on the resistance because you can see him driving
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.480]  the pedals down and his face turning redder and redder as we do the interview.
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.520]  And the Skype was very, very clear audio and video, but the few times it broke up here
[13:21.520 --> 13:22.520]  and there.
[13:22.520 --> 13:32.200]  So we're going to error that coming up later in this hour and into the second hour today
[13:32.200 --> 13:38.960]  with Jim Rogers and boy does he know a lot, you know, he was the guy who made George Soros
[13:38.960 --> 13:39.960]  a lot of his money.
[13:39.960 --> 13:45.760]  He was the partner with George Soros early on who, who increased the wealth of the funds
[13:45.760 --> 13:53.280]  they managed by 4,600% in the same period that the S&P and other indexes went up less
[13:53.280 --> 13:56.280]  than 60%.
[13:56.280 --> 13:57.880]  So very, very interesting.
[13:57.880 --> 14:03.240]  And he basically broke down the crony capitalism where somebody like himself over decades made
[14:03.240 --> 14:06.320]  billions of dollars.
[14:06.320 --> 14:12.560]  Now these big hedge fund managers can make personally 5, 6 billion a year.
[14:12.560 --> 14:18.000]  And again, that's crony capitalism that is going on.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.240]  Also sometime today, sometime, well, before Hankel even joins us an hour and a half from
[14:25.240 --> 14:32.080]  now, an hour and 15 minutes from now, I've got to just briefly comment on the Jesse Ventura
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.720]  David Ike controversy that's going on.
[14:35.720 --> 14:39.520]  And I read this last night and I want to read it again because I had a highlighted copy
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.680]  or a marked copy at home on the points I wanted to make and I forgot it.
[14:43.680 --> 14:47.600]  So I'm going to have to reread this during a break to make my points about these two
[14:47.600 --> 14:56.720]  men and hopefully stop them from getting into a war with each other that is only destructive
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.000]  for those of us that are investigating liberty and freedom.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.560]  I think both men are good people.
[15:01.560 --> 15:05.360]  In fact, I know both men are good people even though I may disagree with both of them on
[15:05.360 --> 15:07.080]  some issues.
[15:07.080 --> 15:13.920]  And it was a comedy of error that caused this because I can read Ike's article and see how
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.960]  he thought he was seeing one thing and really it was another because, well, I'm going to
[15:18.960 --> 15:21.360]  have a message to David Ike especially coming up.
[15:21.360 --> 15:29.240]  Okay, so coming up later in the hour, I could call David up on the phone and tell him this,
[15:29.240 --> 15:31.200]  but I think it's just better.
[15:31.200 --> 15:37.880]  I think it's just better to address Ventura and David Ike together at the same time on
[15:37.880 --> 15:44.120]  there because they got into a big argument and there was a big, big, big fracas and
[15:44.120 --> 15:47.400]  I can tell you that the Ventura camp did not intend this to happen.
[15:47.400 --> 15:48.400]  It's not happy.
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.200]  They called me last night and they've already interviewed Ike two seasons ago.
[15:54.200 --> 15:59.040]  It was very positive and I have been embroiled in the middle of this.
[15:59.040 --> 16:03.920]  I'm in this article, so I don't normally get into this stuff, but these two guys are, you
[16:03.920 --> 16:10.440]  know, towers of alternative thought and for whatever reason they've garnered the attention
[16:10.440 --> 16:11.920]  and so we can't have them fighting with each other.
[16:11.920 --> 16:16.800]  It's like I said some bad things about David Ike 12 years ago because I was asked about
[16:16.800 --> 16:17.800]  it.
[16:17.800 --> 16:23.640]  I said he was a turd in a punch bowl and see, I'm already covering this now.
[16:23.640 --> 16:29.120]  I'm going to comment on it later and the point is that was destructive and so I apologize
[16:29.120 --> 16:30.120]  for it.
[16:30.120 --> 16:40.240]  David Ike is welcome to his opinion and he is a very intelligent person and I mean all
[16:40.240 --> 16:47.560]  these religions out there believe things wackier than what he does and so that was wrong because
[16:47.560 --> 16:52.440]  so much of what he does I know is documented and he's very well spoken, very charismatic
[16:52.440 --> 16:54.080]  and has woken a lot of people up.
[16:54.080 --> 16:58.080]  A lot of the fruits of David Ike are very, very positive and I've talked to him, you
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.120]  know, a lot and I think he's a good guy.
[17:02.120 --> 17:06.840]  Same thing with Ventura and now these two are in a big fight with each other so I will,
[17:06.840 --> 17:08.360]  I'll comment at the bottom of the hour.
[17:08.360 --> 17:11.160]  It's pretty soon, I'll have time to read the article again because I had all these points
[17:11.160 --> 17:12.160]  I wanted to make.
[17:12.160 --> 17:17.200]  I wanted to address each area and in the next two breaks I'll have time to read this.
[17:17.200 --> 17:22.280]  It's titled Jesse Ventura Pet Detective, I must read so I'm going to reread over that
[17:22.280 --> 17:26.960]  in the comment on it and again normally I don't get into infighting and stuff like that
[17:26.960 --> 17:32.080]  but these guys are both really, you know, big icons and alternative thought and it's
[17:32.080 --> 17:37.320]  just destructive to have them fighting and then their supporters and admirers and people
[17:37.320 --> 17:44.320]  fight with each other so I'm going to address it because it's educational on other fronts
[17:44.320 --> 17:48.520]  and it's important to try to get these guys to make up and be friends I think.
[17:48.520 --> 17:52.800]  Okay, wow, where do I start?
[17:52.800 --> 17:53.800]  Let me just do this.
[17:53.800 --> 18:01.400]  I've got like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 stacks here, that's an unlucky
[18:01.400 --> 18:02.400]  number of stacks.
[18:02.400 --> 18:05.360]  You guys better bring me some more stacks in here so I have more than 13.
[18:05.360 --> 18:06.360]  Maybe I miscounted.
[18:06.360 --> 18:16.440]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, right, 13 stacks, well I won't be, I won't
[18:16.440 --> 18:23.360]  be, what do you call it, superstitious, hey we already didn't get on air the first five
[18:23.360 --> 18:26.720]  minutes, the crew did a great job, they had some piece of equipment, had a heart attack
[18:26.720 --> 18:33.200]  right as the show began and had to be power cycled and so that took a few minutes, so
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.120]  I guess 13 is unlucky.
[18:37.120 --> 18:39.720]  Man where do you start with all the craziness?
[18:39.720 --> 18:44.240]  Where do you begin?
[18:44.240 --> 18:48.280]  Where do I begin?
[18:48.280 --> 18:54.000]  Let's just start here, chemotherapy could cause brain damage in breast cancer patients.
[18:54.000 --> 19:00.480]  Really you mean ingesting a whole bunch of bug poison that they charge you $10,000 a
[19:00.480 --> 19:07.200]  month for or more, you mean that might be bad for your brain and the rest of your body?
[19:07.200 --> 19:15.480]  Really the Daily Mail reports here and then let's get into the pedophile culture here
[19:15.480 --> 19:22.960]  since we're looking at Penn State, four going on 40, daycare owner 72, convicted of sexually
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.760]  abusing toddler says he did it because she was so promiscuous and just look at that
[19:28.760 --> 19:33.120]  goblin like creature.
[19:33.120 --> 19:43.160]  Here's another one, this is out of the sun, Menenez cop axed for boy sex claim, this is
[19:43.160 --> 19:48.360]  the guy that reportedly executed one of the witnesses to what was really going on on the
[19:48.360 --> 19:53.160]  7-7 London bombings and he runs around bragging about having sex reportedly with 14 year olds.

[20:34.120 --> 20:38.320]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[20:38.320 --> 20:40.000]  of gold for your retirement.

[23:57.000 --> 24:09.000]  Okay, we're back live.
[24:09.000 --> 24:20.040]  If you go back to 777, there was an electrician named Charles Demendes, who the police for
[24:20.040 --> 24:26.480]  no reason a day after the 777 bombings ran up to him, jumped on top of him, and unloaded
[24:26.480 --> 24:29.800]  their clips into his head.
[24:29.800 --> 24:33.600]  And then they tried to cover it up and lie about it.
[24:33.600 --> 24:40.640]  And looking at the case with the police involved over the years, over and over again, the police,
[24:40.640 --> 24:44.560]  it turns out, are pedophiles or reportedly are pedophiles.
[24:44.560 --> 24:48.640]  Now either they're pedophiles or they're being set up, I don't know, I mean that's
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.320]  the one thing that's hard to come back from, it's one of the globalist favorite systems
[24:52.320 --> 24:54.160]  to set you up, so I don't know.
[24:54.160 --> 24:59.920]  But that top cop has been sacked for claiming he had sex with a boy 14, the son can reveal.
[24:59.920 --> 25:06.200]  Chief Inspector John Duffy boasted about carrying out the vile act to a stranger he met on a
[25:06.200 --> 25:08.320]  gay dating website.
[25:08.320 --> 25:09.720]  And it just goes over that.
[25:09.720 --> 25:20.120]  Now Sandusky has come out and gone on NBC News via telephone and his lawyer has also made
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.640]  statements and he's saying, yes, I horsed around and might have hugged people in the
[25:25.640 --> 25:32.200]  shower, yes, yes, 10 year olds, 12 year olds, 13 year olds people, take him into the shower
[25:32.200 --> 25:38.280]  to hug on them and now they're saying, this is what jocks do, really, I'll assure you
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.680]  no one was touching each other in the showers when I played football, everyone kind of even
[25:43.680 --> 25:47.560]  after years of playing football kind of just went in, got their shower, grabbed their towel
[25:47.560 --> 25:50.200]  and covered up.
[25:50.200 --> 25:58.000]  I'll assure you in the field houses I was in, many years of playing football, there
[25:58.000 --> 26:04.160]  was none of that going on, zero, zero, and the coaches were never in there, they didn't
[26:04.160 --> 26:06.840]  even go in that area.
[26:06.840 --> 26:13.760]  They didn't even go in the showers, people taking showers went in the showers and then
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.800]  I was always getting griped at too because I would just go get my parents to pick me
[26:18.800 --> 26:25.440]  up or go home with friends or a lot of times or get on the school bus just absolutely dripping
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.320]  with sweat stinking like a dead hog and they'd be like, Joe, did you take a shower?
[26:33.320 --> 26:37.160]  Because I wanted to go home and take a shower, I did not like it.
[26:37.160 --> 26:43.480]  Now he's just saying now, oh, he horse played, that's what they saw, he was just grabbing
[26:43.480 --> 26:50.760]  on the little boys, guilty as sin, what a disgusting defense, his house is right behind
[26:50.760 --> 26:57.680]  an elementary school playground, right there we can look up at the fence, his autobiography
[26:57.680 --> 27:05.840]  is called Touched, the prosecutor who was investigating this is believed dead and gone
[27:05.840 --> 27:13.160]  for six years, the sports reporter for the local paper that broke the story says there's
[27:13.160 --> 27:20.320]  more and the reports are they were bringing donors in, of course, if you're raping people
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.600]  in the shower folks, fondling kids, whatever, whatever, and then the school covers it up,
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.200]  you better believe it's well known, he founded this charity, remember that, for disadvantaged
[27:31.200 --> 27:39.120]  youth who no one's going to believe, they've got problems, don't believe them.
[27:39.120 --> 27:47.120]  Continuing, here's another one, Sandusky lawyer impregnated a teen, that's right and
[27:47.120 --> 27:54.160]  then married her, no one, everyone thought he was just her lawyer basically getting
[27:54.160 --> 28:01.360]  her declared an adult, but it turned out she was already pregnant with his child, interesting,
[28:01.360 --> 28:08.920]  just interesting, friends helping each other out a little bit there on that front, and
[28:08.920 --> 28:16.200]  then I bring you this article out of WFAA out of Dallas, also the Dallas Morning News
[28:16.200 --> 28:22.080]  here and CBS TV, I bring you this, I heard a local talk show host talking about how great
[28:22.080 --> 28:27.760]  it was this morning that to occupy Wall Street people, a man and a woman who are homeless
[28:27.760 --> 28:33.720]  because of the economy, had a nine month old baby and they've taken the baby and now they're
[28:33.720 --> 28:38.960]  trying to get the baby to family or to friends and the judge says CPS has to come investigate
[28:38.960 --> 28:44.400]  family or friends before this could happen and the host was basically implying that wasn't
[28:44.400 --> 28:50.000]  even good and the state should just take the child, really, the child is light years safer
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.800]  living on the street, might actually grow up to be a strong child and any of our forebearers
[28:53.800 --> 28:59.640]  grew up as homeless children like Andrew Jackson, homeless by the time he was 12, family killed
[28:59.640 --> 29:04.200]  by the Red Cuts, living in the woods, made him the man he was later, the point is they
[29:04.200 --> 29:08.080]  were taking care of the child, they were trying to save their money to get back into a place
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.480]  as the economy implodes, are they going to take your children when it happens and I just
[29:11.480 --> 29:14.960]  want to tell those talk show hosts, I dare not try to call in because the screener will
[29:14.960 --> 29:23.320]  recognize my voice, that the CPS is 17 times more likely to abuse children than anyone
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.720]  else, pull up the government some numbers, five times more likely to physically abuse
[29:27.720 --> 29:31.680]  them, beat them, now you go pull those numbers up, we've written articles about it just last
[29:31.680 --> 29:36.640]  week and remember that, you get up there all proudly, yeah, just take their kids, their
[29:36.640 --> 29:45.160]  scum, oh yeah, and give them to a bunch of Iranis, oh in that tank half the CPS may not
[29:45.160 --> 29:52.400]  be Iranis, but the other half are, we're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones
[29:52.400 --> 30:01.960]  and the GCN radio network, hi this is Alex Jones, this holiday season more than half
[30:01.960 --> 30:07.840]  of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy, so now is the time to express
[30:07.840 --> 30:13.120]  the holiday spirit more than ever, consider helping those you love with the most important
[30:13.120 --> 30:20.000]  gift, a supply of delicious, easy to fix and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com,

[31:00.000 --> 31:04.760]  you should consider buying a solar power generator, number one, new climate legislation could
[31:04.760 --> 31:09.240]  easily double or triple your electric bill, number two, our new energy czar wants to
[31:09.240 --> 31:14.120]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have, it's true, total government
[31:14.120 --> 31:19.160]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming, number three, in
[31:19.160 --> 31:23.920]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[31:23.920 --> 31:28.720]  legislation is only compounding the problem, number four, dangerous weather is always a
[31:28.720 --> 31:32.760]  threat to local grids, every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[31:32.760 --> 31:37.720]  related onages, number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[31:37.720 --> 31:41.600]  and peace of mind, folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[31:41.600 --> 31:48.000]  from science, one of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[32:00.360 --> 32:06.320]  that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years, he says
[32:06.320 --> 32:10.560]  it will change everything about our lives, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate
[32:10.560 --> 32:14.160]  your children and even how you take care of your health and your own family, now this
[32:14.160 --> 32:18.960]  man has made some outrageous predictions over the years, the crazy part is, he's usually
[32:18.960 --> 32:23.240]  right, you see he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[32:23.240 --> 32:28.960]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties, in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy,
[32:28.960 --> 32:33.000]  recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.680]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener, I can't stress this enough,
[32:37.680 --> 32:41.400]  you should at least watch this free video online today, he explains everything you need
[32:41.400 --> 32:45.360]  to know including simple steps you can take to protect yourself, you can find the video
[32:45.360 --> 32:52.720]  at www.endofamerica3.com, that's end of america, the number three dot com, watch the free video

[33:23.080 --> 33:29.080]  it has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[33:29.080 --> 33:34.960]  of human freedom, but like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one
[33:34.960 --> 33:48.840]  iron rule, logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[33:48.840 --> 34:02.320]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[34:02.320 --> 34:07.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, thank you so much for joining us, we've got the
[34:07.160 --> 34:11.680]  head of the libertarian party, the chairman joining us, we get his view on election 2012
[34:11.680 --> 34:16.400]  and the sorry excuse for candidates the republicans and democrats are putting forward with the
[34:16.400 --> 34:22.320]  exception of Ron Paul and Gary Johnson, then we will also have Webster Gryffin Tarpleon
[34:22.320 --> 34:26.400]  and then some phone calls towards the end of the final hour, perhaps even before that.
[34:26.400 --> 34:30.240]  Let me just give you a smattering of some of the news I've got here because I got stuck
[34:30.240 --> 34:38.840]  on the disgusting Sandusky spider web behavior that's going on, Eurozone break up still
[34:38.840 --> 34:44.560]  a worst case scenario, that's being reported by CNBC, they say give us total power by the
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.560]  mega banks to set up an undemocratic dictatorship, a technocracy, their words not mine and that
[34:50.560 --> 34:56.960]  will fix things, tyranny is the answer and Newsweek says the constitution is the problem,
[34:56.960 --> 35:03.040]  remember that a few months ago and I actually hear people going, the constitution did this,
[35:03.040 --> 35:09.840]  capitalism failed, freedom failed, no we threw that out the door and then everything degenerated
[35:09.840 --> 35:16.720]  but some of the public are just so willfully ignorant, so incredibly dumb, I mean once
[35:16.720 --> 35:21.720]  you get into the real world, get into geopolitics, get into finance, get into economics, get
[35:21.720 --> 35:27.760]  into history, it is addicting and the more you know the less that you do know, but compared
[35:27.760 --> 35:33.360]  to people that think they know it all, oh my gosh, these aren't even children, I talk
[35:33.360 --> 35:39.920]  to insurance company executives, I talk to scientists, I talk to lawyers and they most
[35:39.920 --> 35:47.320]  of them know nothing because they specialize in one area, they want to get out of work,
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.040]  they want to hit the golf course, they want to hit the liquor, they want to get home and
[35:52.040 --> 35:57.960]  play video games or watch sports center, they are not even living, they are just cogs in
[35:57.960 --> 36:06.640]  a machine, not me and not my house, never, never, never, never, the animating contest
[36:06.640 --> 36:12.560]  of liberty is mine, I will have it, I will have the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
[36:12.560 --> 36:16.960]  I want to know the secrets of the universe, I want the species to survive, I'll never
[36:16.960 --> 36:23.360]  know the secrets but my progeny if we survive will, if it takes a thousand generations, we
[36:23.360 --> 36:33.840]  will transcend the globalist scum, we will transcend the new world order.
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.440]  So we got that report, China state media slams Obama over currency remarks where Obama said
[36:38.440 --> 36:45.120]  they should raise the value of their currency so that US exports can be helped, it's like
[36:45.120 --> 36:49.840]  trying to plug holes in the sinking Titanic, also following house prices, trap first time
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.120]  homeowners, well that was the whole setup, that was the whole plan, so depression, design,
[36:55.120 --> 37:04.840]  all right, let me just mention some of the other news coming up here, DOJ wants to criminalize
[37:04.840 --> 37:12.520]  uploading YouTube videos, I'm not kidding, even CNET or CBS's online system, Declan
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.240]  McCullis reporting that, racketeering charges for violating websites, terms of service,
[37:17.240 --> 37:26.080]  all under administrative law, incredible, continuing, FDA allows controversial meat
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.440]  and produce to be blasted with radioactive nuclear waste, that's right, treated with
[37:31.440 --> 37:40.040]  virus cocktails, they spray them with live viruses, can't make that stuff up, Obamacare,
[37:40.040 --> 37:45.520]  again moving forward they think the Supreme Court may actually approve it, then we have
[37:45.520 --> 37:52.960]  this report, ground to air missiles could be deployed at London Olympics, oh, all part
[37:52.960 --> 37:56.200]  of the fear-mongering to make you think the planes are all going to be hijacked when that
[37:56.200 --> 38:00.840]  whole thing was staged, and then meanwhile real al-Qaeda was given control of Libya and
[38:00.840 --> 38:08.200]  given 2,000 high-tech shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles and at least 8,000 other low-tech
[38:08.200 --> 38:13.480]  ones themselves that could shoot down aircraft, the low-tech they got to send, you know, sit
[38:13.480 --> 38:17.440]  a mile from the airport where planes are at 4,000 feet, blow them out of the air, it's
[38:17.440 --> 38:25.400]  just a targeting system, it's basically point and shoot and you just hope that you aim right,
[38:25.400 --> 38:32.280]  but 2,000 that will lock in on the engine heat signature up to 10,000 feet in the air
[38:32.280 --> 38:39.480]  with dead-on precision, 15,000 feet with the type of missile they got with moderate precision,
[38:39.480 --> 38:48.880]  so they just flip it on, aim it, target light starts beeping that it's acquired the heat
[38:48.880 --> 39:02.760]  signature and bye-bye, bye-bye, 777, bye-bye, 747, stretch, bye-bye, but that's not an issue,
[39:02.760 --> 39:08.080]  see real threats, they never hype, because it's great, if stuff gets blown up, they'll
[39:08.080 --> 39:13.120]  just take more of your rights, TSA will just set up more checkpoints on the highway randomly,
[39:13.120 --> 39:18.840]  let's just randomly set them up here and see if we catch a jihadi with a missile, but wait,
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.640]  you gave them the missiles, shut up, you hate America, really, you're the ones destroying
[39:23.640 --> 39:29.040]  America, you're the big megabanks, shut up, traitor, oh boy, so we've got that and then
[39:29.040 --> 39:35.360]  listen to this little, this little jiblet, no, this isn't infowars.com, this isn't prisonplanet.com,
[39:35.360 --> 39:42.080]  I want to show folks a document cam of this, secret farm bill primed for passage in debt
[39:42.080 --> 39:47.760]  deal, all the major spending bills, which are basically almost every bill in Congress,
[39:47.760 --> 39:51.840]  any bill that matters is connected to spending, they don't come out of the house now, it comes
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.280]  out of the Senate and House, six members of each, that violates the Constitution, spending
[39:57.280 --> 40:00.920]  bills are to come from individual House members and go through the committee process for full
[40:00.920 --> 40:04.360]  vetting and it's supposed to come out of the House of Representatives, but now it comes
[40:04.360 --> 40:08.320]  out of the Senate, remember Pelosi this year trying to do spending bills in the year before
[40:08.320 --> 40:15.000]  last, they were trying to bring, you know, Pelosi was even defending bills brought out
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.280]  of the Senate by Harry Reid to the House for spending that originated there, totally unconstitutional.
[40:20.280 --> 40:25.920]  Well now they're just coming out and saying, yeah, the super committee, it will decide
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.760]  everything and the rest of the House, they don't get to vote on it, they can vote it
[40:29.760 --> 40:34.440]  up or down, once the super committee's written the bill and approved it and you don't need
[40:34.440 --> 40:39.280]  other, you know, committees or anything anymore, or even bill readings and then it will just
[40:39.280 --> 40:48.600]  be passed on from that point to the House and Senate and if they don't vote it up or
[40:48.600 --> 40:54.520]  down in a vote, then it goes back to the super committee and whatever they want is done.
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.280]  This is dictatorship of this committee of 13 because the President's the 13th member,
[40:59.280 --> 41:07.320]  I'm going to get into that coming up as well, this super committee is just so incredible.
[41:07.320 --> 41:14.720]  Now continuing here, I want to talk, I want to speak now directly to Jesse Ventura and
[41:14.720 --> 41:20.160]  David Ike and sure I can call both men up on the phone and talk to them, but I want
[41:20.160 --> 41:26.800]  to basically talk to both of them here at one time and give them my two cents and they
[41:26.800 --> 41:32.000]  can listen to it or they can ignore it.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.440]  But David Ike put out a report yesterday that I didn't see till last night and it's caused
[41:38.440 --> 41:46.600]  quite a fracas, Jesse Ventura Pet Detective, a must read and it's up at davidike.com and
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.040]  so here's my message to both of them.
[41:50.040 --> 41:54.000]  David, you know that they interviewed you for the first season of conspiracy theory
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.640]  on secret societies, it was the first time that was ever a national TV show that was
[41:58.640 --> 42:05.000]  anti-sculling bones, bohemian grove, Illuminati and you were interviewed and presented as
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.080]  an expert with gravitas, you were treated with respect, that piece is public, I'm sure
[42:10.080 --> 42:16.280]  you've seen it, so let me just bring that in as evidence, number one.
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.200]  Number two, you are both good people that I know and even if I disagree with some of
[42:22.200 --> 42:27.800]  what both of you believe, it doesn't mean that we're enemies, it doesn't mean that
[42:27.800 --> 42:29.680]  we can't all have our views.
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.520]  Many of David Ike's views, he's insightful, he's charismatic, he's very intelligent,
[42:34.520 --> 42:38.480]  a lot of what he's talked about has come true, he talks about some really wild stuff but
[42:38.480 --> 42:44.280]  truth is stranger than fiction, I'm not saying I'm sold on some of it but a lot of what he
[42:44.280 --> 42:50.440]  covers is mirrored in religions of the world and history, he just has a different interpretation
[42:50.440 --> 42:54.840]  of it and it's a lot less wacky than what some other religions push, so my question
[42:54.840 --> 42:59.640]  is why do people get so upset about what David Ike covers, okay?
[42:59.640 --> 43:06.280]  Now on the subject of Ventura, people are asking, well Alex, what are you talking about?
[43:06.280 --> 43:11.360]  And I've been embroiled in this, I've been mentioned in this several times and so I'm
[43:11.360 --> 43:16.440]  going to cover it here briefly and then go to our Jim Rogers interview, at least parts
[43:16.440 --> 43:20.120]  of it ahead of our guest joining us, the interview I did last night that we're premiering here
[43:20.120 --> 43:29.800]  on the radio today and also streaming at PrismPlanet.tv.
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.920]  There aren't many people in the world that are prominent, who will cover hard subjects
[43:35.920 --> 43:38.920]  and who will delve into things with an open mind.
[43:38.920 --> 43:46.640]  There aren't many people who have a large followings that are well known and who can
[43:46.640 --> 43:51.720]  reach a giant audience anytime they want, Jesse Ventura can do it, I can do it, David
[43:51.720 --> 43:53.840]  Ike can do it.
[43:53.840 --> 43:56.240]  Who else is there at that level?
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.240]  And I was responsible partially for waking Ventura up six years ago and giving him information
[44:01.240 --> 44:06.840]  and material, his son Tyrell had already primed the pump, but I was instrumental in bringing
[44:06.840 --> 44:12.960]  Ventura completely over to a full awakening to the fact that this is a big lie, doesn't
[44:12.960 --> 44:18.720]  mean Ventura has all the answers or I do or Ike does.
[44:18.720 --> 44:23.800]  And I know that he is a good guy who's waking up and learning a lot and has a really good
[44:23.800 --> 44:28.520]  chance to even wake up more and reach tens of millions of people.
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.400]  And so we can't have David Ike and Jesse Ventura fighting with each other because of a comedy
[44:34.400 --> 44:38.680]  of errors and that's my message and then I'm just going to finish up briefly here to Jesse
[44:38.680 --> 44:40.680]  Ventura and to David Ike.
[44:40.680 --> 44:43.360]  This is a comedy of errors.
[44:43.360 --> 44:50.240]  I have been on probably 15 shoots with Jesse Ventura in the last two seasons in this season
[44:50.240 --> 44:52.080]  of conspiracy theory.
[44:52.080 --> 44:55.520]  When they're out in the field and we're at some government facility or something, it's
[44:55.520 --> 44:58.240]  live, it's 100% real, it's happening.
[44:58.240 --> 45:02.040]  But when you sit down to do an interview, sometimes the camera guys and lighting guys
[45:02.040 --> 45:03.880]  will take two hours to get ready.
[45:03.880 --> 45:07.440]  I've been there many times with Ventura's like, come on, let's get this done and then
[45:07.440 --> 45:13.880]  he'll just kind of rant and rave about the new world order and police state and stuff
[45:13.880 --> 45:14.880]  and issues.
[45:14.880 --> 45:15.880]  I mean, he's a real person.
[45:15.880 --> 45:18.480]  He's really passionate behind the scenes about these issues.
[45:18.480 --> 45:19.480]  He'll talk to a waiter.
[45:19.480 --> 45:23.920]  He'll talk to troops at the airport.
[45:23.920 --> 45:26.760]  He will sit there and talk at people.
[45:26.760 --> 45:36.280]  And so what happened is Ventura rode the train for a day to get there to meet in Cleveland,
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.800]  Ohio with David Eich where he was speaking.
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.720]  And in reality TV, they do not want the people that are about to meet to meet beforehand
[45:45.720 --> 45:48.600]  because they want it to be real.
[45:48.600 --> 45:52.520]  And so Ventura gets down there and he's in one room and right next to it's Eich, they're
[45:52.520 --> 45:53.840]  keeping him apart.
[45:53.840 --> 45:58.560]  He hears Ventura for an hour talking about issues.
[45:58.560 --> 46:01.520]  Eich is feeling like, Eich says, well, I'd like to go in and meet him.
[46:01.520 --> 46:02.520]  Eich's a nice guy.
[46:02.520 --> 46:04.000]  He's like, I'd like to go meet him.
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.080]  They're like, no, no, no, no, you can't meet with him now because it's just some mid-level
[46:09.080 --> 46:15.480]  or low-level person who's keeping the schedule.
[46:15.480 --> 46:18.640]  And that's what he says in the articles, like, no, no, no, no, sorry, not right now.
[46:18.640 --> 46:19.640]  Didn't tell him why.
[46:19.640 --> 46:25.320]  So he sits there for over an hour hearing Ventura right in the next room basically saying,
[46:25.320 --> 46:30.640]  hurry it up in this new world order and ranting about issues.
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.040]  And then Ventura comes in and they sit down and they start doing the interview and Ventura
[46:36.040 --> 46:39.960]  is like, give me bullet points, boil it down.
[46:39.960 --> 46:44.400]  And Eich's like, come to my nine-hour thing and Ventura is like, I can't, I got to get
[46:44.400 --> 46:52.440]  back on my, you know, train and Eich's will then, and then Ventura and it's all described
[46:52.440 --> 46:58.320]  here is like, come on, you know, tell me, you know, when's to see a lizard person and
[46:58.320 --> 47:02.480]  Eich wants to get all into history and Sumerian texts and Garden of Eden and all this stuff
[47:02.480 --> 47:06.480]  and then it's interdimensional or spiritual or whatever.
[47:06.480 --> 47:12.840]  And there's basically like a blow-up is basically what he says and he just got up and left.
[47:12.840 --> 47:17.120]  Now I get a call last night from the Ventura camp, I'll just leave it at that, and they
[47:17.120 --> 47:21.360]  were upset and they weren't even asking me to call like for them or what they should
[47:21.360 --> 47:22.360]  do.
[47:22.360 --> 47:23.360]  They were just telling me, have you heard about this?
[47:23.360 --> 47:26.040]  And I said, no, I haven't heard about it.
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.280]  And so I pulled up the article and read it and I said, well, what I think you ought to
[47:30.280 --> 47:37.640]  do is contact David Eich because there's not many people at this level trying to wake folks
[47:37.640 --> 47:38.640]  up.
[47:38.640 --> 47:39.640]  We don't need people fighting with each other.
[47:39.640 --> 47:43.800]  I said, I, you know, called him turd in a punch bowl 12 years ago, it was wrong.
[47:43.800 --> 47:45.840]  I apologized for it.
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.280]  We need to maybe do a Skype interview since he's gone back to England where, you know,
[47:50.280 --> 47:55.120]  we could say we decided to, you know, try one more time with Eich and then let Eich somehow
[47:55.120 --> 47:56.480]  boil it down for him.
[47:56.480 --> 47:59.120]  Because, you know, Eich will end up being in the TV show like three, four minutes.
[47:59.120 --> 48:02.680]  So that's why they were like, give it to us quick here, crystallize it.
[48:02.680 --> 48:05.360]  And Eich's like, no, I'm not going to do that.
[48:05.360 --> 48:09.360]  Now speaking to David Eich, reading his article, he's like, first the arrogant one Ventura
[48:09.360 --> 48:15.360]  sits there for an hour making me wait, blabbering, well, that's because Ventura is so real.
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.160]  You know, he's in there talking about the new world order.
[48:19.160 --> 48:23.560]  Then, you know, Braverman wanted me to sign the release form first because this was obviously
[48:23.560 --> 48:24.560]  a setup.
[48:24.560 --> 48:26.000]  And I could see how it looked like a setup.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.120]  No, they always want people to sign a release form in case something happens in the interview.
[48:30.120 --> 48:33.960]  And Ventura is going to ask hard questions, but that's just standard for TV.
[48:33.960 --> 48:36.760]  And David Eich was a national TV host.
[48:36.760 --> 48:40.880]  He knows that, but I can understand how this all looks.
[48:40.880 --> 48:44.280]  And then he also, the one thing Eich does that isn't fair, and I understand that David
[48:44.280 --> 48:45.920]  was upset, so I'm not attacking him.
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.040]  I've said things that I think are a little bit, you know, off color.
[48:49.040 --> 48:52.840]  He says, oh, they keep mentioning, you know, on TV how he was a Navy SEAL.
[48:52.840 --> 48:55.360]  Well, sorry, you know, don't Navy SEALs kill people?
[48:55.360 --> 48:56.360]  I don't think that's good.
[48:56.360 --> 48:58.000]  I'm not into killing people.
[48:58.000 --> 49:05.160]  Well, by the way, Jesse's anti-war and anti-offensive war.
[49:05.160 --> 49:07.240]  So he's not into killing people either.
[49:07.240 --> 49:09.920]  Basically, I know Ventura.
[49:09.920 --> 49:11.920]  Sometimes he gets in kind of a grumpy mood.
[49:11.920 --> 49:14.280]  I'm sure that's what was going on.
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.680]  Eich had been super ill, so ill, he almost didn't do the interview with us.
[49:19.680 --> 49:27.960]  And he still did the interview the day before, did the interview with them, and both guys
[49:27.960 --> 49:30.720]  aren't going to be pushed around, and they just clashed.
[49:30.720 --> 49:31.720]  Two tough guys.
[49:31.720 --> 49:35.000]  Because, you know, Eich, back in his day, was a tough guy, and champion soccer player,
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.680]  and, you know, I've read about him and stuff.
[49:36.680 --> 49:37.680]  He's not a wimp.
[49:37.680 --> 49:40.120]  And so the whole deal is, you get two tough guys together.
[49:40.120 --> 49:41.120]  They start arguing.
[49:41.120 --> 49:42.480]  Eich thinks it's a setup.
[49:42.480 --> 49:43.480]  It blows up.
[49:43.480 --> 49:47.440]  But Eich, and I mentioned here, he says, well, Alex said it was going to be a nice friendly
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.800]  piece, and I'm sure Alex meant well and is correct.
[49:49.800 --> 49:53.600]  He says, I have no doubt that Alex believed what he said to be true.
[49:53.600 --> 49:56.720]  But the problem was, you know, something else happened.
[49:56.720 --> 50:01.320]  David, you were on their show two years ago, and it was totally positive.
[50:01.320 --> 50:06.400]  What's happened here, David, is that Ventura is nervous covering these subjects, but he's
[50:06.400 --> 50:09.480]  covered all the hardcore things that can be proven.
[50:09.480 --> 50:10.840]  People want to hear this covered.
[50:10.840 --> 50:20.480]  And so this season, some of their episodes are subjects that Ventura isn't entirely
[50:20.480 --> 50:21.480]  comfortable with.
[50:21.480 --> 50:26.200]  So he's going to put you on the hot seat, and I always see David shine on the hot seat
[50:26.200 --> 50:28.200]  on international television and things.
[50:28.200 --> 50:29.200]  So David was sick.
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.800]  Ventura was in a grumpy mood.
[50:30.800 --> 50:36.320]  You guys need to get back on the phone, be friends, and not have this piece come out
[50:36.320 --> 50:41.280]  with the blow up and all this, just because it makes interesting TV.
[50:41.280 --> 50:47.080]  It needs to, you guys need to be friends and agree to disagree and not let this happen
[50:47.080 --> 50:52.200]  so that all of your supporters on both sides start fighting with each other over this.
[50:52.200 --> 50:54.240]  Let's not divide and conquer here.
[50:54.240 --> 50:56.080]  I understand David's issue.
[50:56.080 --> 50:57.640]  We all need to be friends.
[50:57.640 --> 50:58.640]  That's what I have to say.
[50:58.640 --> 51:03.520]  With new financial dominoes falling each day, do you know who really runs this country?
[51:03.520 --> 51:07.080]  This is Alex Jones with a special message about the gangster economy.

[51:11.560 --> 51:14.080]  be the most important message you'll ever hear.

[52:04.240 --> 52:09.760]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those
[52:09.760 --> 52:13.000]  who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[52:13.000 --> 52:20.040]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart for every action there is an equal and
[52:20.040 --> 52:21.360]  opposite reaction.
[52:21.360 --> 52:26.800]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War.
[52:26.800 --> 52:30.640]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[52:30.640 --> 52:37.520]  The globalists are scared, they've overreached, the future of the Info War is in your hands.

[52:54.840 --> 52:58.280]  The Info War now goes into high gear.

[55:44.240 --> 55:49.960]  come back and just continue airing it into the next hour, then I'll get into all this
[55:49.960 --> 55:51.880]  other news we've mentioned.
[55:51.880 --> 55:57.320]  Let's go ahead and go to the Jim Rogers interview from last night on the fact that it's a foregone
[55:57.320 --> 56:03.880]  conclusion, total global meltdown.
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.600]  I can't really predict it, I've got some of the news articles here and what he sees coming
[56:07.600 --> 56:13.160]  up in the future, his latest bestselling book is A Gift to My Children, A Father's Lessons
[56:13.160 --> 56:19.720]  for Life and Investing and of course you can also go to his website, Jim Rogers, that's
[56:19.720 --> 56:27.680]  R-O-G-E-R-S.com and he's also a Guinness Book of World Record Holder on multiple fronts,
[56:27.680 --> 56:28.680]  we'll get him to talk some about that.
[56:28.680 --> 56:36.080]  Now, he joins us here while he's on his exercise bike in the beautiful, I guess, semi-tropical
[56:36.080 --> 56:42.960]  environs of Singapore and so we turn now to Jim Rogers joining us here at infowars.com.
[56:42.960 --> 56:45.000]  Jim, thank you for joining us.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.480]  I am delighted, yes, I did Singapore, we're on the equator, in Singapore it's either always
[56:50.480 --> 56:52.720]  hot or always hot in rain.
[56:52.720 --> 56:59.120]  Well, I tell you, I've probably watched you 300 times on national television, Fox, CNBC,
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.080]  you name it, I don't think I've ever seen you on an exercise bike, so we're honored
[57:04.080 --> 57:05.560]  that you're doing this with us.
[57:05.560 --> 57:11.240]  Well, I'm delighted, I'm multitasking, I try to get two things done at once so if I fall
[57:11.240 --> 57:13.720]  off the bike you'll be the first to know.
[57:13.720 --> 57:18.160]  Okay, Jim, wow, now listen, there's a lot of stuff written in the press, I want to make
[57:18.160 --> 57:20.160]  sure this is accurate.
[57:20.160 --> 57:25.800]  A few days ago, a bunch of reports came out that you said global collapse, a done deal.
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.280]  What's your view on the world economy right now and where it's going?
[57:29.280 --> 57:35.880]  Well, Alex, every four to six years in America we've had a slow down or a recession ever
[57:35.880 --> 57:37.880]  since the Republic, beginning of the Republic.
[57:37.880 --> 57:45.200]  So we're overdue for one, the end of 2011, 2012, 2013, so it's going, it always happens,
[57:45.200 --> 57:50.800]  it's going to happen again, despite what politicians and central bankers tell you.
[57:50.800 --> 57:56.240]  The next time around it's going to be very bad, it's just this, you know, 2002 we had
[57:56.240 --> 58:04.320]  a slow down, 2008 it was much worse, 2012, 2013 is going to be worse still because we
[58:04.320 --> 58:09.920]  shot all our bullets, I mean, U.S. cannot quadruple it's dead again, we cannot print
[58:09.920 --> 58:15.520]  more money again, staggering amounts of money again, so this is going to be a mess, a huge
[58:15.520 --> 58:20.000]  mess, there's nothing we can do about it.
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.960]  Now let's talk about, because I know you don't like to toot your own horn, but I've
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.960]  printed up a bunch of news articles here, I remember you three, four years ago saying
[58:26.960 --> 58:31.880]  what they did wasn't going to work, that you'd see all sorts of parenties going down globally
[58:31.880 --> 58:50.400]  the commodities, this is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.400 --> 58:54.360]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[58:54.360 --> 58:59.040]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[58:59.040 --> 59:04.160]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs, the respiratory system
[59:04.160 --> 59:09.160]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses, the Silver Lungs Generator
[59:09.160 --> 59:15.600]  infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[59:15.600 --> 59:21.040]  the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream, with continued legislation threatening
[59:21.040 --> 59:26.840]  the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[59:26.840 --> 59:32.160]  with the Silver Lungs Generator, very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided,
[59:32.160 --> 59:39.440]  making production fast and simple, go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[59:39.440 --> 01:00:03.280]  technology of the Silver Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:21.200]  And you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:32.000]  I know you don't like to chew your own horn but I've printed up a bunch of news articles
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.040]  here, I remember you three, four years ago saying what they did wasn't going to work,
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.480]  that you'd see all sorts of currencies going down globally, that commodities was the place
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:49.480]  to go and gold's gone from 300 to 1800, silver's gone from $5 to $30 plus dollars, you're saying
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.320]  get into farmland, chew your own horn though just so people can understand why you made
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.440]  the predictions you did, quite a bit of what you predicted has come true, break down how
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.680]  you were able to make those predictions and then what you see coming in the near future
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.240]  and then even the medium term.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:13.920]  Well Alex, partly because I know what's happened before in the world in the early 1990s, Japan
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.160]  had a problem like this, they refused to let people fail, they propped everybody up, you
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:27.480]  remember the term zombie banks, zombie companies, well it's 21 years later, Japan is still suffering
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:32.680]  because they didn't accept reality, they didn't take the pain, the Japanese stock market is
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:40.880]  down 80%, that's 80% in the last 21 years because they refused to accept reality, America's
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.600]  going to have the same problem, we're going to product prop everybody up, that does not
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.600]  work.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.520]  In Sweden at the same time, 21 years ago in Scandinavia I should say, they took the
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:59.080]  pain, it was horrible for two years, three years, but since then after starting over,
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:06.200]  taking the losses, taking the pain, Scandinavia's had a wonderfully vibrant and dynamic economy,
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:13.080]  it just doesn't work to proper failure, to reward incompetence, that's what capitalism
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:19.160]  is all about, competent people come in, take over the failed assets from the failed people
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:27.080]  and start over, what we're doing in America, we're taking the assets away from the competent
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.480]  people, giving them to the incompetent people and saying, okay guys, now you can compete
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.200]  with the competent people with their money, it's outrageous morality, not that politicians
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:44.400]  care about morality, but it's horrible economics, it came out and will not work.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.320]  Well I'm certainly no rocket scientist, I mean I'm not a guy that's made people tens
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.840]  of millions of dollars like yourself and has a 30, 40 year track record of doing it, but
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:58.000]  studying economics, studying history, when you see a bunch of countries start basically
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.660]  turning up the printing presses and then paying for the garbage derivatives with more printing
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:14.440]  press money, it seems like I've seen all these third world countries go that direction, so
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.880]  correct me if I'm wrong, I mean is that why basically you're saying that there's no way
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.880]  to turn this around or what are some of the other factors that feed into that?
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:31.680]  Well Alex, the cure for too much debt is not more debt, although in Washington they seem
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.280]  to think, well we had too much consumption, too much debt, so let's solve that problem
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.520]  with more consumption and more debt, I mean it's astonishing the grownups would say something
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.400]  like that out loud, if it were that simple, every country in the world would be prosperous,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.920]  but what's always happened for this, you're all up yet, debt fails, then they start printing
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:59.600]  but if all you had to do was pile up debt and print money, Zimbabwe would be the richest
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:06.680]  country in the world right now, many countries would be extremely rich, it doesn't work,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:12.160]  economics is pretty simple, if you spend money you don't have, you either pay it back or
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:18.080]  go bankrupt or suffer the consequences, we've already had one lost decade in America, we're
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.880]  going to have two, three, four, I don't know how many lost decades we're going to have
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.160]  until we accept reality.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:35.440]  Okay, then just to be clear then, you are saying that a global financial collapse is
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.600]  a foregone conclusion, no way to turn it around, no way to stop it now?
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.440]  I'm saying yes, we're going to, next time we have a recession and we're going to have
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.240]  one I guarantee you, it's going to be worse than anything we've experienced in the last
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:05:00.200]  two decades.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, this is our last
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.080]  chance to not relive history.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:11.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.440]  at home.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:17.560]  We've turned immense influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560]  shots.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.840]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:33.520]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.080]  saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.960]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960]  of the Republic.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:53.400]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:59.680]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.640]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:08.240]  Folks there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.000]  listeners to do three things right away.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.400]  Number one, study the past.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.680]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.520]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.360]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.440]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.600]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.520]  signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.840]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.320]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.200]  You'll also get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200]  half.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.920]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.920]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.440]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.160]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.720]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.640]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.080]  health and your own family.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.120]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.480]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.680]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.680]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.040]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.120]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.320]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.800]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.440]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.680]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:49.360]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.080]  Here's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:14.280]  It is Tuesday, the 15th day of November 2011.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:20.920]  The chairman of the Libertarian Party is scheduled to be joining us, coming up here at the bottom
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:26.240]  of the hour, and an investigative journalist, historian, and economist, Webster Tarpley,
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.720]  traveled to Syria, will be reporting live from Syria with us, coming up for a little
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.520]  bit of the third hour, then, to your phone calls.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.920]  We've got just some incredible news here with the Occupy Wall Street ousted, look at this
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:49.480]  headline out of the New York Post, NYPD raiders roused Occupy Wall Street rabble.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:55.280]  Whether you agree or disagree with Occupy Wall Street's general aims, whether they
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.920]  are run by Obama or not, certainly Obama tried to take them over.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.680]  Calling American demonstrators, rabble is disgusting.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.240]  And apparently you can only occupy other countries, not this one.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:15.080]  I mean, I thought America was a free speech zone, and I have confirmed, and I want to
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:22.080]  do a report on this, I've confirmed here in Austin and in New York, and I'm getting
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.280]  the documentation together, that the police were ordered going back over a month ago,
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:32.160]  in early October, that when they arrest homeless for sleeping under bridges, or release them
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.200]  out of jail for disorderly conduct, or release them out of mental institutions, they're
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.880]  telling them, go to the Occupy camp, there's free food there, and you're allowed to stay
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.480]  there.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.760]  And that's why it totally degenerated into, even if they had porta-potties, the homeless
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.320]  are drunk out of their mind or whatever, some of them, defecating on the ground, all
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.280]  this TV showing up, what do you think's in the prisons?
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.080]  They're saying, they've got to shut these down because TV showed up, okay, well, what's
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.360]  going on in the prisons?
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:08.160]  And I watch video, we got some of them posted at infoworks.com and prisonpunner.com, and
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.800]  the police just beating the snot out of people for no reason, and getting off on it.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.960]  That's what tyranny looks like.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.040]  Could be one thing if the police are ordered to, and they're saying, they've been there
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.320]  too long or whatever to try to move people out of an area, but they are enjoying in the
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:32.280]  mob psychology attacking people, and the New York Post calls them rabble.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:43.400]  Rabble means a organization or group of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, people that are not held
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.920]  in high regard in society, scum.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.320]  And they're just generally saying, protesters are scum.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.760]  In fact, guys, let me get the exact definition with you.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.400]  I know we're about to go back to the Jim Rogers video, but later I'll actually give you the
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.720]  definition of rabble, but the one I gave you is pretty darn good.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.320]  Just total demonization.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.760]  Meanwhile, see, once tyrants break the Bill of Rights and Constitution or the Constitution
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:14.240]  of the country that was protecting the people, once you convert to an oppressive system of
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:23.840]  all the different flavors of it, it certainly has 31 flavors or more, then the dissent accelerates.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:30.480]  You'll see more tyranny in a year once corruption's really taken over than you saw in the previous
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.640]  100.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.280]  And now, and this is how I read their announcement, it was a different than just a super committee.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.520]  It was a super Congress, 12 members, spending bills originating from them now, not from
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.760]  the House.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:47.400]  The House and Senate can vote it up or down, but then if they don't vote for it, it just
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:54.120]  goes back to the super committee, who then automatically puts into place whatever they
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.520]  already agreed on.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.760]  That is so incredible.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.560]  That is dictatorship, hidden in plain view, and people go, well, no, the Congress gets
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.560]  to vote.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.280]  It's just if they don't do what the super Congress says, then they go ahead with the
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.360]  automatic spending cuts that they decide were to place them.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.920]  But you notice that they never say cut the tens of trillions given to foreign bankers.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:23.080]  It's always raise taxes, cut spending to pay it to the bankers who got us into this mess.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.440]  As they now admit, private corporate, bank of the world, dictatorship being set up in
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.440]  Europe.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.440]  That's not Alex Jones.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.360]  That's London Telegraph Associated Press Time Magazine.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:39.920]  But they're saying it's good.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.080]  Secret Farm Bill, prime for passage in debt deal.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.200]  You're not allowed to see it.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.920]  Remember five years ago Bush's third amnesty plan, and they said it's not amnesty, but
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.920]  you can't see it.
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.920]  Remember that in the news?
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.520]  So incredible.
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.840]  And then Senator Sessions leaked it.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:57.840]  They threatened to censure him, but they couldn't for doing his job.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.360]  Let those criminals try that.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.880]  And what was Senator Sessions' piece called on his website?
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:13.680]  The 20 smoking guns, and then he went over the 20 loopholes of it, and it said, well,
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680]  they're right.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:15.680]  It isn't amnesty.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.880]  It's total amnesty for even aggravated felons.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.080]  They sign a pledge to not commit aggravated felonies again.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.080]  Aggravated felonies.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.080]  That's knocking you on the head.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.680]  People, armed robbery, arson, aggravated.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.120]  It's not just a crime.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.480]  You did it with a gun.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480]  You did it with a club.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.160]  You beat somebody over the head.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.640]  That's why I don't respect this government.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.640]  It's not real because they openly release criminals and then throw the book at citizens
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.800]  with made-up garbage.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.320]  So we're going to get to that.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:54.640]  Let's go back, though, now to the guy that's made tens of billions of dollars through his
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:00.520]  big hedge funds, a guy who's probably called the markets as accurate or more accurate than
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.000]  anybody out there, Jim Rogers, and we'll look into more of this interview that I did last
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.960]  night on InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.440]  The whole thing's posted at PrismPlanet.tv.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.440]  Here it is.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.920]  Okay.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:22.080]  Then, just to be clear, then, you are saying that a global financial collapse is a foregone
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:27.080]  conclusion, no way to turn it around, no way to stop it now?
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080]  I'm saying yes.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.680]  The next time we have a recession and we're going to have one, I guarantee you, it's going
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:38.560]  to be worse than anything we've experienced in the last few decades because of the stack
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.400]  of amounts of debt that have been built up in the U.S. and in Europe.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.640]  Now, there's a way.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.040]  Sure, we could take an alternative course.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.760]  We could accept reality.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.120]  We could let people fail.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.640]  All those guys from Wall Street should have failed.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.920]  The idea that they're still driving their Lamborghinis is outrageous.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:04.160]  As far as they're all getting their bonuses, outrageous, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.200]  You and I are paying for it.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.200]  We could do that.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200]  We could let them fail.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.360]  We could take our pain, admit our mistakes.
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.840]  It would be very bad for two or three years.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840]  Alex has no question.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.440]  It would be a mess.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:24.120]  But the alternative is to have 10, 20, 30 years of more lost decades and lost years from
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.120]  our lives.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.120]  All right.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.880]  Jim Rogers is our guest.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.720]  We're honored to have him and a premier interview with him on the exercise mic.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.720]  I'm actually loving this.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:39.000]  I think this is pretty media-worthy and again, we appreciate your time and joining us.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.720]  Shifting gears to North America.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.680]  I know you're out in Singapore now and later I'll ask you why you're there and your prognosis
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:52.480]  in this global meltdown for Asia versus Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, basically
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.040]  your global perspective and what you're investing in right now.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.880]  But here at home, Ron Paul predicted all of this 30 years ago on sound, Austrian economics.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:05.320]  I know that you study a little bit as well.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:10.040]  And now he is being demonized.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]  And that's when he's lucky.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:16.320]  They've done scientific studies now that show that he's getting the least amount of time
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:23.080]  at the debates, that when he does get coverage, it's negative, that also when he wins first,
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:32.480]  second, or third place, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, now CBS will not show him in the poll rankings.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.960]  So if he gets number one, they say number two was number one.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.720]  Or if he gets number three, they skip him and move number four into number three.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.120]  And we just caught CBS over the weekend doing it again.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.960]  It became a national news story, but wait, it gets better.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:51.280]  It was a non-invented debate, Jim, but only an hour was televised of a televised debate.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:57.760]  He was given 90 seconds and it turns out a memo came out when Rick Perry was given on
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.400]  it like eight minutes, Mitt Romney more than 10.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.240]  I mean, if this isn't a rigged horse race, what's your view on that and why they're scared
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240]  of Ron Paul?
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.800]  Well, it's clear, and I've read the same things you have.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.760]  It's clear that they're biased against Ron Paul.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760]  I don't know why.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.160]  I guess the only reason is because he's the only one who talks good sense.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.440]  He's the only one who knows how to solve the problems.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.720]  I happen to agree with nearly everything he said and have for a long time.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.720]  And it's just so different to what all these journalists have been brought up reading and
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:42.440]  believing and writing, they all go to the same schools where they talk chains and failure.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:49.640]  And so they think that this guy, who's got a different view, must be, unless ignored.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.160]  Unfortunately for them, he's the only one, not the only one, but he's one of the few
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.120]  who's got it right.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.000]  And somebody, I don't know if the electorate would get it in time, but he's one of the
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.600]  few who knows what has to be done.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:09.720]  Jim, looking at history, looking at geopolitical movements, looking at finance that you've
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.160]  studied so long and investment so accurately, and that's the real gauge of a tree is its
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160]  fruits.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.720]  Your fruits have been very successful and stable over a long period of time.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:24.400]  Well, seriously, looking into your crystal ball, I mean, and then looking at the United
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.160]  States, it's clear they're not going to listen to Ron Paul.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:32.680]  He is the only one of those Republicans that is talking sense, and one of only a few prominent
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.440]  people in the U.S. talking sense.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:40.240]  The establishment wants to go the same direction, crony capitalism, insiders being guaranteed
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.240]  by the public.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.320]  So much you and Congressman Paul have talked about.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:50.320]  And now the elite are financing the welfare class to be their political army to demand
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.560]  more and more off the tit.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:00.480]  And I see historically real calamities, real collapse, real social unrest here in the U.S.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.040]  Obama has already tried to sick the Occupy Wall Street people on the middle class claiming
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.840]  you know that he's anti-corruption and Wall Street when he's financed by it.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:12.280]  So what do you see for America and Europe?
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:16.120]  I mean, do you see a lot of really unstable things happening because it's clear they're
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.120]  not going to listen to you.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.200]  They're not going to listen to Ron Paul.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]  They know you're right.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]  It's why they're scared of you.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.040]  So is this ship going to hit the iceberg?
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.040]  What's going to happen?
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040]  What do you see?
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.360]  Where do you see America in five years?
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:33.800]  Well, first, there's also a guy named Gary Johnson who is running for reprimandation.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.320]  He seems to get it too, as well.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:42.560]  I mean, he hasn't been as prominent so long as Ron has, but he also seems to get it.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.560]  But what's going to happen?
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.560]  It's what I've said many times.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.640]  There's going to be more social unrest all over the world.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:58.640]  We've already had some governments fail and some countries fail, haven't we?
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.520]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.800]  Are you gaining fat, feeling tired, losing desire in the bedroom?
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.440]  Get back in the game.

[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:38.320]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:48.240]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.680]  The war is here.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.640]  It's an Info War.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:58.840]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:16.680]  You know, this whole Sandusky situation at Penn State is just a tiny window into the world of the globalist in the New World Order. They are a collection of degenerate scum.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:26.680]  A lot of them have different tastes, but they all want to carry out crime against humanity. It is their twisted lot in life. They are the minority.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:34.680]  They are white. They are black. They are German. They are Chinese. They are Jewish. They are Arabic. They are Mexican. They are Japanese.
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:41.680]  But they are all part of their own culture of wickedness, and they are waging war against free humanity.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:47.680]  That's why I don't get into people's religions, people's race. The system tries to play us off against each other.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:25:01.680]  I look at the contents of individuals' minds, what they stand for, what they believe in. And the globalist, looking at this new degenerate situation, I'm going to talk to the head of the libertarian party about this in a moment,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:13.680]  looking at this new degenerate situation, and I'm going to do reports this week into next week on this, they are now saying he is the frontrunner even above Mitt Romney.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:25.680]  Globalist, Council on Foreign Relations professor, picked by the globalist in Georgia to run for Congress to kill the Republican-Conservative Revolution of 94.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:38.680]  He wrote the forward and sections of two books, Best Sellers by Alvin and Heidi Toffler. That's where he was discovered by the establishment, and they got him to run for Congress.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:47.680]  And, you know, I actually got one of the books here, I'm going to go dig it out later, a few weeks ago I meant to cover it, but he was still so low.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:57.680]  And I said, watching power surge, because most of these polls are fake, the system is going to bring him in. They're really pushing him right now.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:03.680]  But he wrote in those books, he said America's got to get rid of its sovereignty and be part of a new world order global government.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.680]  But he sold it like it was technology in the future and the information age, yes, a technocracy.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:18.680]  Technology is neutral, at least at this form of its development, but it's being puppeteered towards evil.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.680]  And then every time I mention he supports carbon taxes, I get emails saying I'm a liar.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:35.680]  Well, look, if you don't know that, I can't help you. Okay, I mean, you could just type into Google to the NSA search engine, Newt Genrich promotes carbon taxes or Newt Genrich promotes global warming.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:43.680]  And you'll see him in speeches, at dinners, you'll see TV ads he did with Nancy Pelosi.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:51.680]  It's got to be Cointel Pro, people aren't that stupid. I get emails and see articles saying I'm lying, they don't throw troops, bodies and landfills.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:57.680]  Even when it's in the mainstream news, they just attack whatever I say, so fine.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:09.680]  I told you two years ago, a year ago, that Rick Perry was Al Gore, Chief of Staff in Texas, supported gun control, supported sanctuary cities, went to Bilderberg Group,
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:16.680]  doubled the size of the state of Texas, NAFTA, GATT, Gardasil, and on a bunch of those people said that's not true, he didn't work for Al Gore.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:21.680]  That's not true, he didn't do this and that, and I just was like, yeah, yeah, he did.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:29.680]  And I gave the documentation and then later it got picked up by the national media and Rick Perry is in deep political trouble and having some type of weird meltdown.
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:37.680]  Newt Genrich is perhaps even worse than Rick Perry, not that I thought it was possible.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:44.680]  I mean, look, Al Gore, horrible, Bill Clinton, terrible, Barack Obama's just absolutely evil.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.680]  They're all bad, they're all bad.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:53.680]  There's one person, he's an older gentleman, they make fun of his suit being too big, but his mind is great, his knowledge is great.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.680]  He's a true statesman, a true humanitarian, Ron Paul.
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  And I've got all the articles here today.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:15.680]  Genrich takes the lead, public policy polling.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.680]  Now in all the polls I've seen, Paul's been second, third, or fourth, and we showed last night a new CBS piece.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:31.680]  They've got to call Watson about that because it's up on prisonplanet.tv, a listener pointed it out, or CBS, when Ron Paul won the poll, removed it and then just said that he wasn't even in the rankings.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.680]  Caught him again, 89 seconds, and then people try to play games.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:39.680]  They go, Alex, the clip you played was over two minutes long.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.680]  What do you mean 89 seconds?
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  We taped it.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.680]  Did you not read the description on the video?
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.680]  Did you not hear what I said?
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.680]  The televised debate on CBS was 60 minutes.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.680]  There's a CBS memo admitting he was to be given 90 seconds.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.680]  It's all confirmed.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:04.680]  Yes, he was given a minute or so more once it went off TV for just the internet, and the audience was much smaller.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:07.680]  But the televised debate, he was given 89 seconds.
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:08.680]  I'm saying again.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:15.680]  So again, they try to twist everything that we say, they analyze it all, twist it, and then shove it out there to say we're lying.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:21.680]  It's confirmed by the memo he was given 90 seconds, which he took 89 seconds of.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.680]  So don't try to weasel out of that by saying no, he had two minutes and 10 seconds.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.680]  In the televised part, he had 89 seconds.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.680]  89 seconds.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:34.680]  We got to go after Newt Gennrich now.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:39.680]  They're going to keep just bringing new puppets in, knowing you'll wake up to them and then they'll move on to another puppet,
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.680]  who they can slip in last minute during the primaries.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.680]  That's their plan to try to shoot down Ron Paul.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.680]  Stay with us. We're going to break down election 2012.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.680]  The continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:32.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:46.680]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.680]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.680]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:37.680]  Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.680]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.680]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.680]  Under motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:33:16.680]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we launched a major offensive yesterday.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.680]  I'm going to tell you about that and then we're going to go to Mark Hinkel, the National Chairman of the Libertarian Party,
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:31.680]  the only third party that's got ballot access in all the states right now.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:37.680]  So looking at 2012, we're going to discuss Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party, Jesse Ventura, a lot more,
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.680]  and where the Libertarian Party sees this country going.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:47.680]  I see a huge awakening for Liberty, but we're going to get his take because he obviously has got a lot of boost on the ground
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.680]  and talks to great Libertarian activists and citizens all over this fine nation.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:59.680]  Before I go any further, for much of a year we had the Google bomb that a listener recommended,
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.680]  and over 70 times I should have done it more if I would have known they could have created an algorithm to defeat us,
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.680]  where we could have the top Google searches that would then cause every time hundreds of articles, blogs,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:13.680]  and newspapers to write about whatever term we put out there.
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:22.680]  Google admittedly rewrote their entire system on ranking and made major changes to stop it.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.680]  I mean, that's the effect we're having.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:28.680]  They admittedly were questioned by major publications about it, and they said,
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.680]  well, we're going to do something about it, and they did.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.680]  To the point of now even when things organically go up the charts, they're trying to block it.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:42.680]  So we did a Twitter bomb yesterday or a tweet bomb, truth bomb, whatever you want to call it.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.680]  I don't know how to gauge it because I don't understand Twitter yet,
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:52.680]  but we saw just hundreds of thousands of people Twitter the term info wars.com,
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:56.680]  and we got additional about 300,000 visitors yesterday on top of the million or so.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.680]  So it had a big effect.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:04.680]  We're still studying this State Department CIA organ as it's admittedly, just like Google,
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.680]  and we're going to try to find cracks in the defenses to exploit the system.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.680]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.680]  We're going to defend the Republic and defend human liberty against the corporate board together.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:22.680]  Now, also, I want to challenge everybody to intensify the Info War in 2011 into 2012.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:30.680]  I am offering all of my films that are on DVD, America Destroyed by Design, The Matrix of Terror,
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:36.680]  The Masters of Terror, The Matrix of Evil, Reflections and Warnings there in Rousseau,
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.680]  Fall of the Republic, The Obama Deception, Police State for the Rise of FEMA, Terror Storm,
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.680]  The Police State Trilogy, all three films in one package on three DVDs,
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.680]  Endgame, Blue River Global Enslavement, Martial Law, The Order of Death, The Road to Terrority,
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:56.680]  9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, and then, of course, my audio CD, The Music of Endgame and Terror Storm.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.680]  It's excellent with some rants on it and a free citizen rulebook and bumper stickers.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:06.680]  That is all $99.95 and the small profit we make goes into this information warfare system,
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:11.680]  the nightly news, the syndicated radio show, hiring more reporters, everything we're doing.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.680]  And you can finish all your Christmas shopping in one fell swoop at infowars.com.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:20.680]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:31.680]  We have also discounted all the bumper sticker packages for a blitz of those posted in legal and lawful places.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.680]  You can get those at cost right now at infowars.com.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.680]  I will not continue this special forever just because it's totally,
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:44.680]  I've had to hire more people, it's turned into a huge, huge fiasco in the back
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.680]  because there's so many orders coming in, but it's a good fiasco.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.680]  So now we're up to speed, got it all shipping out, but you can order those bumper stickers at cost.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.680]  But I'm only doing that through Christmas just because it's too much of a good thing.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.680]  Okay, enough said.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:07.680]  I want to now shift gears to Mark Hinkel, and he's been part of the Libertarian Party for more than a decade
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.680]  and just done a great job.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:16.680]  Mark4Chair.com was the site he had when he was moving to get elected national chairman of the Libertarian Party.
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.680]  Their executive director is Wes Benedict.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.680]  I've met him.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.680]  He used to live in Austin.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:21.680]  Great guy.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:28.680]  And Mark Hinkel joins us because he can really give us his view of how big this awakening is.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.680]  Obviously Ron Paul getting even more support and being really a Libertarian than he got just four years ago.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.680]  What does that signify?
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:37.680]  What are they seeing at the state levels?
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:45.680]  What's their view of 2012 and both the mainstream establishment candidates, Obama and then the other Republicans?
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.680]  What's his ideas for strategy?
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:56.680]  Who are some of the people that the state Libertarian groups are looking at who they think are some of the people that may run for Libertarian president?
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.680]  We're going to discuss it all with Mark Hinkel right now.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680]  Mark, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  I appreciate it.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.680]  Alex, delighted to be on your show.
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.680]  Appreciate the exposure.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680]  You bet.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.680]  We appreciate you.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.680]  So you just heard that diatribe of questions.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.680]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:16.680]  You expect me to remember all of that?
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:27.680]  Well, I need to start this off with a correction, but I do need to tell you that we're currently on the ballot in about 29 states, not all 50 states.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.680]  Now, our goal is 50 states ballot status.
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:37.680]  But as you can imagine, Republicans and Democrats who control ballot access kind of don't like competition.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.680]  And of course, we are the competition.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:48.680]  And so last time around in 2008, I think we spent about a half a million dollars just to get our candidates on the ballot.
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:54.680]  And in some states, we can't get our candidate on the ballot as a Libertarian.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.680]  We have to run them as an independent.
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.680]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:59.680]  I mean, obviously I'm going from the last cycle.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:02.680]  I guess you've got to climb the mountain each time again.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.680]  But I remember reading at the time, you got it in 48 states, right?
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.680]  And then had to run them as independent in a couple?
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.680]  Yes, exactly.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:15.680]  And in the history, we're about to approach our 40th anniversary on December 11th.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:24.680]  And in our 40th years, we've managed to gain 100% ballot access, DC, Guam, et cetera, four free time.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.680]  And hopefully 2012 would be the fourth time.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.680]  But we have some significant hurdles.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:34.680]  And of course, these are hurdles that Republicans and Democrats don't typically have to jump over,
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:39.680]  but they make us and the Greens and the US Constitution Party, et cetera, jump over these.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:45.680]  Which in and of itself is, I think, blatantly unfair and blatantly undemocratic.
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:49.680]  And by the way, I think the Constitution Party is absolutely fabulous.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  You know, Aaron Russo and others involved in that also involve the Libertarians.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:58.680]  But I mean, from my study, obviously, the most viable, I mean, the one that's got the roots,
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:01.680]  has the biggest infrastructure, is the Libertarians.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.680]  Yep, true enough. And we have had that for quite some time.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:09.680]  I think right now, the Constitution Party is on the ballot in about 11 states,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.680]  so we're almost three times ballot access.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:20.680]  And we do think, as you said earlier, there's such a reassertance of people who look at the Constitution,
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:26.680]  value the Constitution, try to uphold and re-energize the Constitution,
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.680]  and bring liberty back to the United States.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.680]  I think it's pretty darn clear who anybody who's really paying attention,
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.680]  we've involved into a socialist state.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:42.680]  And everywhere around the world where socialism has been tried, it's failed miserably.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:46.680]  Yeah, it's like catching a case of pancreatic cancer, brain cancer.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:53.680]  I mean, it never works except for rulers that have armies of black uniformed enforcers.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.680]  Right. And even those, you know, tend to fail over time,
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.680]  because I think there's just an internal spirit of people seeking freedom.
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.680]  And when tyranny is imposed, people just automatically rebel against it.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.680]  And we've seen this in the Middle East, and we're seeing it around the world.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.680]  And I think there is a big reassertance.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.680]  You know, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson in the Republican Party,
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.680]  I mean, clearly I think they're setting a lot of the debate
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.680]  because of the issues that they're bringing up.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.680]  Frankly, most Republicans, Democrats would prefer to do what he said.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.680]  She said, you know, saying, hey, I'm a good guy.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.680]  No, he's a bad guy.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.680]  Whereas libertarians like to talk issues.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:44.680]  And so we actually bring issues to the table that Republicans, Democrats would prefer not to discuss.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:50.680]  Now, speaking of the Republicans and Democrats, I mean, you look at Ron Paul,
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.680]  he actually raises issues.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:54.680]  He's actually super ultra informed.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.680]  I've probably interviewed Ron Paul a hundred times or more.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:03.680]  And there's never an article that he isn't already aware of, even if it came out that day.
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.680]  So when people have asked Ron Paul, he reads and scans over about 30 newspapers a day.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:13.680]  Now, the Internet, he scans that highly disciplined, sleeps about five hours a night.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:14.680]  He is a machine.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:23.680]  Obviously, he is an incredible constitutionalist, a founding father material in not my view, in my research.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.680]  A perfect constitutional voting record.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.680]  He would really would be the superstar candidate for the libertarians.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:32.680]  And Ron Paul has been asked about this.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.680]  Obviously, right now he's using the Republican Party engine.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:36.680]  He has a chance.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:43.680]  They've been ignoring him, keeping him down to 89 seconds in the last debate in the televised portion on CBS.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:47.680]  But he has said, well, he won't rule out a third party.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.680]  And I've told him on air, I've told him off air, and we'll be talking to him either tomorrow or sometime next week.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.680]  He's very busy, but I'm going to bring this up to him.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:02.680]  If he doesn't look like he's going to win the primaries by May, then he's got to switch over to a third party to keep issues injected
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.680]  and to try to force his way into the debates.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:13.680]  And the only platform there and the platform that also fits right into his worldview is the libertarians.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:23.680]  So he's on this launch pad right now, but if his rocket doesn't get launched properly, we can just move the Saturn 9 rocket right over
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.680]  and put it on the libertarian launch pad.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.680]  What's your take on that as the National Chairman of the Libertarian Party?
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:36.680]  Well, as a chairman, I can't endorse any particular candidate prior to our nominating convention.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:47.680]  But we certainly welcome anybody who is serious about freedom and, you know, Ron Paul in particular, you know, has been our 1988 presidential candidate
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.680]  and he is a lifetime member still in the Libertarian Party.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.680]  So, you know, he certainly would be welcome here in the Libertarian Party.
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:03.680]  As with former Governor Gary Johnson, who was also a DuPain member of the Libertarian Party back when he was Governor of New Mexico.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:10.680]  So both of those folks would be very welcome and we'd love to have them come in and compete for the nomination.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.680]  And I suspect either one of them would get a very warm reception at our National Convention next year in Las Vegas.
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.680]  Nevada.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.680]  Well, that's really well said.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:29.680]  I mean, I understand you're staying neutral on this because it's for the libertarians of the nation to choose who they want.
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.680]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:32.680]  Talk about that process.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:39.680]  So other than the Republicans and Democrats, they typically have the taxpayers fund their primary system.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:45.680]  But Libertarians think, hey, that's the private organization that's selecting their candidates.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.680]  So the taxpayers should not be subsidizing their party activity.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:54.680]  So we run our own caucuses and create our own delegates.
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:58.680]  Our delegates go to our National Convention that they pay their own way.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:05.680]  I understand Republicans and Democrats get something like $60 million each from the taxpayers in order to fund their convention.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.680]  We fund it out of our own pockets.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.680]  Thank you very much.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:11.680]  The taxpayers subsidy is allowed.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.680]  And we'll meet, as they say, the first weekend in May in Las Vegas.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:23.680]  And the delegates assembled there will listen to all the candidates and they will pick who are the nominees.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.680]  It will be for both President and the Vice President.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:36.680]  So Ron Paul has plenty of time to either win the Republican nomination, be winning in the first primaries,
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:41.680]  or making a good showing so he knows he still has a trajectory to win.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.680]  At what point, if you were Ron Paul, would you eject out of the Republicans?
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:48.680]  And this is his last hurrah.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:50.680]  He's not running for reelection in the House.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:51.680]  Right.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:58.680]  At what point would you eject and get over there and, obviously, with no problem, take the libertarian nomination?
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:04.680]  Well, here's the key issue with regarding anyone who's running in another primary system.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.680]  There's about four or five states.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.680]  I think Pennsylvania, Ohio, and I think Texas are three of them.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.680]  So this is a pretty big state as far as both are concerned.
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:19.680]  They have what's called a sore loser law.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:25.680]  So by law, if, say, Ron Paul were to run, say, in a Pennsylvania primary and lose,
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.680]  and then he decided to say, okay, I'm going to run as a libertarian,
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.680]  his name for President would not appear on the November ballot.
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.680]  Likewise, for Ohio, Texas, I think there's one or two other states.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.680]  So, clearly, if Ron is going to run as a libertarian,
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:47.680]  he ought to do it before those primaries and those key popular states.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.680]  So if by March he isn't doing really good, he's going to have to basically eject.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.680]  Yeah.
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:57.680]  And again, our convention is going to be the first weekend in May.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:00.680]  So, obviously, it has to be before our convention is held.
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:05.680]  And the sooner he does it, obviously, I think from the convention standpoint,
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:13.680]  the sooner any candidate jumps into the race, I think they're going to receive a more welcomed response.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.680]  Because, you know, libertarians, we like to think of ourselves as, you know, the primal party,
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:22.680]  and not the, you know, rejects from the Republicans or Democrats,
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:26.680]  but the sooner if somebody decides, hey, we're going to run as a libertarian,
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.680]  I think they'll get the very warm reception.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.680]  And it'd be great to see the competition as we all know competition creates a better candidate,
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.680]  and the competition will help create more media, more awareness,
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:44.680]  more donations to the party and to the candidates and create more excitement.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:49.680]  And they say with, you know, the Tea Party movement and the Occupy Wall Street movement,
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.680]  clearly lots of people are very, very unhappy with the Republicans or Democrats.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:02.680]  In fact, one of the things I like to point out, in the last years that the staffs are available from 2008 to 2010,
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:08.680]  only one political party gained registration, voter registration, and that was the libertarians.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:14.680]  Another political party lost, and of course the real big winner has been those who are registered as the client of state.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.680]  And just to give you an example, I live out in California in San Francisco.
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.680]  Everybody thinks San Francisco is this liberal Democratic hotbed.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.680]  29% of the voters are registered as the client of state,
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.680]  which is our state's bureaucratic name for independence.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:35.680]  So clearly a lot of people are very unhappy with Republicans or Democrats.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.680]  Well, it's the same thing in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:41.680]  They call this a big liberal bastion.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.680]  That's just because the liberals get together and vote and control the system.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:47.680]  This is more of a libertarian constitutionalist area.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.680]  Now shifting gears into another subject, Jesse Ventura.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.680]  I mean, obviously I told him, I said, look, I mean, if you want to run as libertarian,
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.680]  you need to work with the states and go ahead and just take it.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.680]  But he said, well, yeah, but still I want to talk to the leadership and see what their ideas are or their recommendations.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.680]  Have you had a chance to talk to Jesse yet?
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:11.680]  No, in fact, I've actually contacted your show a couple of times to try to get Jesse's number.
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:16.680]  So offline you want to give me Jesse's number, I'll be more than happy to give him a buzz.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:20.680]  Okay, because because I am.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.680]  All right, well, I've got to get permission to give you his number, but I'm sure there won't be a problem.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:27.680]  I'm just going to call him after the show today because he does want to talk to you guys.
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:30.680]  And I know some people see Jesse as a loose cannon.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.680]  But I think the fact that he really is a real guy and it does have a lot of libertarian views.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.680]  I think that's the kind of, I mean, we need to get attention.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.680]  We need to break this, this, this two party dictatorship.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.680]  And that's all Jesse Ventura talks about.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:48.680]  Yeah, yeah, this duopoly clearly is not serving the needs of the people.
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:54.680]  It's all special interest, all insider trading, all corporate welfare, all of that needs to come to an end.
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.680]  And I think the people are really kicked in.
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.680]  I think people are so thirsty for alternatives.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.680]  And what do you think of a Jesse Ventura as Vice President Ron Paul at the head of the ticket idea?
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.680]  I think very interesting.
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.680]  Again, I know Jesse comes with a little bit of baggage, but it would be a very interesting race.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.680]  And I think it would generate a lot of media attention.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.680]  So it would be very interesting.
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:27.680]  I have no sense from the delegates that I know whether Jesse would be very well-received.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:34.680]  I certainly, for a year's show, have gotten several dozen email notes and phone calls from your listeners saying,
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.680]  hey, get in touch with Jesse.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.680]  We'll make sure that happens. Stay there.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.680]  I want to get into some other issues.
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:43.680]  I mean, I've got a lot of questions, but I want to hear from you what you think is most important.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:50.680]  We've got the chairman of the Libertarian Party nationally on the line with us. We'll be right back with Mark Hinkel.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:54.680]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:51:17.680]  We'll give you the Libertarian website on the other side.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:46.680]  Call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:58.680]  With ageless mail, you can raise your testosterone naturally by 61%.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:05.680]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:10.680]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:15.680]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:20.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:27.680]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:35.680]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:45.680]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:54.680]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:57.680]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:06.680]  As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass. Undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost muscle.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:12.680]  Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or are high in sugar.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:18.680]  This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to build new muscle proteins.
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:23.680]  The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your growth hormone from causing muscle repair.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:31.680]  By giving your body easily absorbed, undamaged whey, free of added sugar, you may be able to gain back lost muscle and strength.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:35.680]  One World Whey is truly undamaged whey protein powder, free of added sugar.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:41.680]  Both young and elderly are reporting increases in muscle strength and size without any additional exercise.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:57.680]  Go to www.oneworldwhey.com to read or hear some impressive testimonies to this effect.
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:20.680]  I've started taking One World Whey and it gives me so much energy, I'm able to jog a lot further.
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:25.680]  And when you scoop it out, we got a bunch of whey, it's the best I ever tasted.
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:32.680]  When you scoop it out, it actually jumps off the spoon, it's like charged or something.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:37.680]  Rob Jacobson was showing me, we ought to show people this on TV sometime.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.680]  It is the best whey I've ever had, it's amazing.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.680]  Okay, side issue there, I was just digressing after hearing that radio ad.
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:53.680]  Mark Hinkel is our guest, LP.org, for Libertarian Party, LP.org is their website.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:56.680]  What do you think is most important front and center right now?
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.680]  For me, it's that there is a huge awakening.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:06.680]  We don't want the establishment to misdirect that into more collectivism, more cancer being the solution.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:14.680]  We have to realize the fight for the heart and soul of people's political awakening is happening right now.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:20.680]  Absolutely, I know a lot of people have been, over the years, been fairly apathetic about politics,
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:26.680]  but as you well know, just because you're not interested in politics doesn't mean politicians aren't interested in you.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:30.680]  And so, yeah, we definitely want to tap into the three assertions.
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:36.680]  People at gut level, I mean, certainly looking at the economy, they know things are terribly wrong.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:43.680]  And the government is more involved in running the economy than ever before and things are worse than ever before.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:50.680]  It seems to me that Obama is just running off the old FDR playbook back in the Depression.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:56:02.680]  And if anybody has ever read the New Deal, Raw Deal by Burton Folsom, he details how basically FDR extended the recession into a massive depression,
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:07.680]  the Great Depression, as everybody's calling it, because the government got involved.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:14.680]  And one point I'd like to really point out is about a year after the crash of 29, unemployment was at 10%.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.680]  And people clamored for the government to go out and do something about that, and they did.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.680]  And one year later, unemployment was at 20%.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.680]  That's what you get when you get the government involved in trying to solve problems.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:35.680]  Of course, now they just lie and say, oh, we only have 9.2%, but every other economist says it's over 20%.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.680]  Well, same thing with unemployment.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:41.680]  You know, they count only the people who are currently receiving government benefits.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:48.680]  Those people are unemployed, but everybody who's run off the unemployment rolls or who are working part-time
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.680]  and have given up looking for full-time work, those people don't count.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:55.680]  Kind of odd, because the government is quote-unquote supposed to care for it.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.680]  They don't count people like that.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:04.680]  And of course, out here in California, there's 177 jobs in which you have to get permission from the government,
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.680]  i.e., licensing, the certificate, in order to go into those fields.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.680]  And of course, that limits the number of people who can go into those fields,
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.680]  so people who are down at the bottom of the economic ladder.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:19.680]  They have a tough time climbing up the economic ladder.
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:23.680]  And it makes it where there's less entry-level jobs, as you said, and this happens throughout history.
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:28.680]  The guilds go and lobby government to shut down all their competition.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.680]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:35.680]  And it's bad for the consumer because that drives prices up.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:42.680]  And this is anywhere from, you know, taxi cab drivers to people cut hair, lawyers, doctors, nurses, you name it.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:48.680]  All these restrictions restrict the supply, which means healthcare is less affordable,
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:51.680]  it's less service providers than that drives up cost.
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.680]  Yeah, what's your view? I mean, obviously you hate it, but on government-run healthcare,
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.680]  how can they have so-called Republican-dominated courts approving it?
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:01.680]  Well, look at Newt Gennrich.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:03.680]  Look at, in fact, we're going to break.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:08.680]  Can you do five more minutes with us and talk about some of the other candidates and the Republicans?
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:09.680]  You got it.
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:12.680]  Let's start talking about that now for about 30 seconds.
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:16.680]  I mean, these Republicans, how are they any different than the Democrats?
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:20.680]  Well, if you look at Romney Care, it's like, hey, what's the difference between
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.680]  Obamacare and Romney Care?
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:26.680]  It's all government-run, government-mandated, government-forced insurance.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:31.680]  And of course, any time you increase the demand for any kind of service,
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:35.680]  you increase the supply or the cost, you decrease the supply.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.680]  Stay there. We'll be right back.

[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:19.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:27.680]  Well, we have the National Chairman of the Libertarian Party with us for five more minutes, Mark Hinkel.
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:32.680]  And we were talking near the break, and I brought up the fact that,
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:36.680]  no matter what you believe about 9-11, official story or not,
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.680]  it's being used to take our liberties.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:40.680]  Absolutely.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:43.680]  It's being used for all these no-bid contracts.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:46.680]  And all I know...
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:54.680]  It's been used to institutionalize grouping and public funds being by TSA agents.
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:57.680]  That isn't an outrage. I don't know what it is.
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:02.680]  You know, I heard Jerry Sandusky now. He's out on bail. He's applied for a TSA job.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:06.680]  Well, he's probably qualified.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.680]  Yeah, well, they say he'll be the specialist for the children.
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:15.680]  You know, what they do to children at those airports is what... is illegal.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:19.680]  It's the same stuff Sandusky now admits that he was horse playing,
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.680]  grabbing on the children naked in the shower.
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.680]  But that wasn't pedophilia, according to him.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:26.680]  Well, you know, from a Libertarian standpoint, we say,
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:32.680]  look, if I wear a government uniform and I do something and it's considered okay,
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.680]  but if as a private citizen I do the exact same thing, it's illegal,
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.680]  you know, you ought to check your premise there.
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:44.680]  I think that's the essence of tyranny historically.
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:47.680]  What do you think of these Republican candidates?
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:51.680]  I mean, they're all as bad as Obama and they're the leaders.
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:53.680]  What's wrong with Republican voters?
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.680]  I mean, is it just that they're spoon fed by the media because they...
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:03.680]  I mean, because somebody's a Republican, it's okay to support giant government?
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:05.680]  Well, let's not blame the Republican voters.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.680]  I mean, let's look at the candidates themselves.
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:11.680]  They're bought and paid for, and the reason they're bought and paid for
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:14.680]  is because, of course, the government controls so much of the economy.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:20.680]  I think it was P.J. O'Rourke who made the quote that when the legislature controls
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.680]  the first thing bought and sold is the legislature.
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:27.680]  And that's exactly what's happened both on the Republican side and the Democratic side.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:31.680]  It's, you know, different special interests, but they're all being bought and sold.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:37.680]  Look, I know the American people are smart on average, and I understand that,
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:39.680]  but they've got to take some of the blame.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:47.680]  These Republicans that love to bash Obama all day, Rick Perry, people like Mitt Romney,
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:52.680]  I mean, they are, their real record is like Obama, the rhetoric is just different.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:57.680]  Right. And again, that's where the blame does, in fact, fall on the voters
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:03.680]  because if you just take the sound bites and you just look at the brochures on the website
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:06.680]  and actually not do the research that really needs to be done
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:09.680]  and look at the key issues and what they really did in office
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.680]  as opposed to what they said in office,
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:15.680]  then, yeah, you're not doing your job as a citizen of the United States.
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:18.680]  Mark Hankel is our guest LP.org.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:22.680]  Check it out today if you haven't or get involved.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.680]  Now is the time, my friends, in closing,
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:28.680]  before it would take four to eight years for folks to wake up
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:30.680]  that the new boss was the same as the old boss.
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.680]  Now I see people waking up in six months or so.
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:38.680]  There's an acceleration in people not buying into the old fraud.
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:43.680]  If the system doesn't do the right thing and unblock people like Ron Paul,
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:45.680]  what do you see happening in the next cycle?
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:48.680]  If we're seeing this much unrest now.
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:53.680]  Well, clearly, in fact, shows like yours are really have done a tremendous job.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.680]  I mean, just on the air while we were talking here,
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:58.680]  I've gotten pre-email messages from your listeners.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.680]  So thank you, Pete and other Thomas.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:08.680]  But, yeah, we've got to get out there and create some real change.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:13.680]  And, you know, as Albert Einstein once noted,
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:15.680]  sanity is doing the same thing over and over again
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:17.680]  and expecting different results.
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:22.680]  So if you expect Republicans and Democrats to solve the recession flash depression,
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:27.680]  wherein, when in fact they caused it in the first place, you're insane.
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:33.680]  And so I think it's incumbent on all citizens to take an active part in politics
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:35.680]  and decide, look, do you want the status quo?
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.680]  Do you want to continue down the rabbit hole and to further, further repression
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.680]  and tyranny and higher taxation?
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.680]  Or do you want a little press of freedom?
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.680]  And you're not going to get it from the Republicans and Democrats,
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.680]  only the libertarians and perhaps some of the competition folks
[02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:55.680]  who want to bring...
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:59.680]  Absolutely. We're out of time, sir. Thank you.
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:01.680]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.680]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized risk.
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:08.680]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:11.680]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.680]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.680]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.680]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:25.680]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials.
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:28.680]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:33.680]  that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.680]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:38.680]  you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:03.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:06.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:08.680]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:11.680]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:15.680]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:17.680]  and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:22.680]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:26.680]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:30.680]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:33.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.680]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:38.680]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:39.680]  who do we make the checkout to?
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:41.680]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:46.680]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:31.680]  This just in from the Daily Caller now linked at infowars.com.
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:38.680]  New emails DOJ Eric Holder manipulated press for favorable fast and furious coverage.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:41.680]  It's now been leaked that they were manipulating the press.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.680]  That's like saying it's now been leaked that turtles have hard shells on their backs
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:47.680]  or birds tweet.
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:48.680]  I mean it's just ridiculous.
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:52.680]  Attorney General Eric Holder Justice Department sought to manipulate reporters.
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:54.680]  Really?
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:58.680]  Coverage of operation fast and furious during the days proceeding the November 1st
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:01.680]  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.680]  New emails obtained by the Daily Caller indicate it just goes over all of that.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:06.680]  Of course they did.
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:09.680]  They were shipping the guns in there from the beginning.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.680]  When this was already breaking in local news they had CBS come out with the whitewash
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:17.680]  that oh they were tracking guns to people that were buying them at gun shops.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:20.680]  That was the cover to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:23.680]  They were shipping them in 18 wheelers into Mexico.
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:27.680]  That's all come out and shipping drugs back in.
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:29.680]  El Paso time Chicago Tribune.
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:32.680]  But it's got no national attention.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:37.680]  And I told you a year ago this went back to the Bush Administration and before.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:42.680]  Now ISIS had to admit that and that's why they won't go after Holder who's been caught
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:44.680]  lying.
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:50.680]  New poll shows four-way tie in Iowa as Ron Paul moves to top tier.
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:55.680]  CBS has absolutely been devastated by giving him 89 seconds on the televised part and now
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:00.680]  being caught when he won first place in the poll just removing him completely as we showed
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:04.680]  and documented last night on the nightly news which is big breaking news.
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:06.680]  We don't even have an article out on that today but it's big.
[02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:08.680]  There's so much.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:13.680]  It's like pearls before wonderful people but there's so many pearls who can gobble them all up.
[02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:15.680]  So that's some of the news there.
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:21.680]  Now joining us from Syria is Doctor of History.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.680]  He's an economist and he's also very brave.
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:25.680]  He's a best-selling author.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:29.680]  He wrote the unauthorized biography of George H. W. Bush.
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:34.680]  Bush 41 he wrote the unauthorized biography on Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:38.680]  And I read that thing three and a half years ago and thought this is unbelievable.
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:40.680]  Now it's all come out.
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:43.680]  And so he's nonpartisan. He's covering the issues.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:45.680]  And he's in Damascus.
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.680]  He's in Syria.
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:49.680]  He's over there right now.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:52.680]  And again I'm not saying Assad is some cupcake.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.680]  It is a dictatorial system with a bath party.
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:02.680]  But they're going to remove the government and put al-Qaeda in place and turn it into a new jihadi base.
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:09.680]  The West is on record funding the uprisings of the last six months and then calling him peaceful democratic.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:11.680]  Blowing up police stations and stuff.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:12.680]  Same thing in Libya.
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:14.680]  Now al-Qaeda flies the flag.
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:17.680]  Webster was there while it was being bombed for weeks.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:19.680]  While reporters were being shot.
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:21.680]  I mean he was under bombardment.
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:32.680]  He's now there in Syria giving us a report on how this ties in to the larger strategic operation to overthrow old allies like Mubarak, overthrow others.
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:39.680]  But in Saudi Arabia is criticizing Syria for shooting back at armed globalist funded gangs.
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:42.680]  But Saudi Arabia is shooting peaceful people.
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:44.680]  That's hailed as liberal and loving.
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:54.680]  But when Syria does something even less, which I'm not defending, that then it's just unbelievably horrible and the rest of the Arab League condemning them.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.680]  I mean they're moving into a World War III constellation.
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:58.680]  Webster, you're there.
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:11:59.680]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:02.680]  The latest and why this is going on.
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:05.680]  Webster Griffin Tarpley of Tarpley.net.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:06.680]  Thank you.
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:07.680]  Thank you, Attic.
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:13.680]  I just spent a day in the city of Homs, H-O-M-S.
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:28.680]  And if you watch any of this coverage that the U.S. and European media are putting out, they're telling everybody that Homs is the great tether of this rebellion, the democracy revolt that's supposedly going on in Syria.
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:34.680]  And I've just been walking on over this place and I can tell you that this is a complete big lie.
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.680]  It is one big lie.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:44.680]  And of course, it's important for people to know this because the people in NATO, right, be it Obama, Sarkozy, Cameron of Britain,
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:52.680]  they're really willing to go towards some kind of a general war, at least in the Middle East, in the name of this destabilization of Syria.
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.680]  So let me just set the stage.
[02:12:54.680 --> 02:13:02.680]  Starting from Damascus this morning, we drove north on a four-way highway.
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:09.680]  And one of the first things you notice when you come to Syria is that it's very different from Libya, that there are no checkpoints.
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:16.680]  I mean, you come into the International Airport, Damascus International Airport, it's functioning normally.
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:18.680]  There's no special security.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:20.680]  It looks pretty much like a normal airport.
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.680]  You drive into the city, first thing you see, no checkpoints.
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.680]  But we now have, but we're told this is a great tyranny.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:33.680]  We now have internal checkpoints where TSA now grabs your wife's breast and your genitals on the highway.
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:35.680]  So is that why we've got to invade?
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:39.680]  Because pedophiles don't get to grow up Syrian children?
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:41.680]  Well, let me just try to continue.
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:46.680]  The idea then is the other thing you notice is that there are no checkpoints.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:48.680]  I guess we went by two.
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:57.680]  One is at the entrance to the city of Homs, there's a very low-key kind of checkpoint looking at cars, but nothing much.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:04.680]  And then if you want to go visit the governor of this province, which we did, we went and visited the governor.
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:11.680]  And I want you to know, this was the first delegation of foreign journalists that was allowed to go to the city of Homs.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:19.680]  And there were some people from other newspapers, in particular some Catholic journalists from Europe, from Belgium and from France were there.
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:26.680]  So we got to meet the governor of the city of Homs, and he's accompanied by a group of religious leaders.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:33.680]  And you got to remember, Syria is a place that has 15% Christians in the population.
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.680]  It's more than Egypt, right?
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:35.680]  Egypt is 10%.
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:37.680]  Here it's 15%.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.680]  So it's more.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:41.680]  So you have your Greek Orthodox metropolitan.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.680]  You have a Greek Catholic.
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:47.680]  Those are Catholics that are more or less connected to Rome with the Pope.
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:53.680]  And also Syrian Catholic, the patriarchate of Antioch is a very old and very influential one.
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:55.680]  And that's right here in Syria.
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.680]  Sure, that's the church set up by Paul.
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:58.680]  So continuing.
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:14:59.680]  Yeah, look.
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:09.680]  That's not as you mentioned that I stayed overnight very close to the place where St. Paul was converted on the Damascus Road.
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:12.680]  And this is a place you can go and visit.
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:20.680]  So the governor tells us there is a huge plot, a huge conspiracy against Syria.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.680]  And the religious leaders basically say the same thing.
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:34.680]  So now we wanted to go and see with the help of some of the people from the patriarchs of these Christian churches of these,
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:42.680]  go and see the neighborhood, which is supposed to be the great center of this rebellion that the BBC talks about all the time.
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:48.680]  It's a neighborhood called Zahra, Z-A-H-R-A. Zahra is the place.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:51.680]  This is a couple of square miles.
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.680]  Harms is a city about one million.
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.680]  That makes it smaller than Damascus.
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:58.680]  Damascus is about six million.
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:03.680]  So we go to the neighborhood of Zahra and they tell us there's a demonstration going on.
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:05.680]  You're here right at the proper time.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:13.680]  So we go to see this demonstration, expecting to see people attacking Assad and attacking the government, right?
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:17.680]  Because that's what the international media has told you is actually going on.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:21.680]  This is a demonstration which is pro Assad.
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:27.680]  It's true that they don't like the governor, the guy that we had just met for various local reasons.
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:35.680]  And the principal complaint they have is there's not enough heating oil for the people to heat their homes now that the winter is coming,
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:37.680]  because it's getting rather chilly.
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:40.680]  And of course the sanctions, the sanctions are helping.
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:41.680]  The sanctions, exactly.
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:46.680]  That's the reason why it's not really the governor's fault, it's because of these sanctions.
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:50.680]  So then we, after talking to these people for a while, we go to the local hospital.
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:55.680]  Now, this should be the place where everything is made clear,
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:03.680]  because you're talking about the Zahra neighborhood hospital in Harms, in the great center of this revolution.
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:07.680]  And a lot of people, like the spontaneous demonstration forms,
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:14.680]  when this busload of Western correspondents parks in front of the hospital of Zahra.
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:16.680]  And people tell us this.
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:21.680]  They say, today we had seven wounded, five killed.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:22.680]  So we asked, who did it?
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:24.680]  And they say, snipers.
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:25.680]  Well, who are they?
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:26.680]  Well, we don't know.
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.680]  Many, many theories.
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.680]  I'll tell you about that.
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:30.680]  And they have, obviously they have some facts.
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:34.680]  But today in this one neighborhood, seven wounded, five dead.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:36.680]  But it's not like this is going on everywhere.
[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:42.680]  This is supposedly the center of what would maybe one or two other places in the entire country.
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:46.680]  And by the way, you have made a beeline right to where the snipers are.
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:48.680]  We should point out Tarpley's very brave.
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:52.680]  But I mean, Webster, to be clear here, because I just do the research.
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:53.680]  I just go off the facts.
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:57.680]  And it's just like al-Qaeda being put in to the east of Libya,
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:00.680]  and now taking over and flying the al-Qaeda flag and saying,
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:03.680]  they're going to put in al-Qaeda law and all this stuff.
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.680]  And thousands of shoulder fired surface air missiles are gone.
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:09.680]  And our media just says, I'll ignore that.
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:12.680]  But I've gone and looked up even what Voice of America admits.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:18.680]  It is armed groups that pop up sometimes in clear western CIA uprisings,
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:22.680]  shoot people, and our media calls them democracy activists.
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:26.680]  So clearly this is not an excuse to attack Syria.
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:30.680]  But now they've gotten the Arab League to come in a miscreant fashion
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:34.680]  and start calling for sanctions, further sanctions.
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:36.680]  So I guess they're all afraid.
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:40.680]  But as long as they back all this, I guess they won't be the person next
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:42.680]  who's taken down.
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:44.680]  What do people think of this?
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:49.680]  I spent the last couple of hours in the middle of a crowd of a couple of hundred people
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:51.680]  who wanted to be heard.
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.680]  And anybody who could speak a little French or a little English would come to the floor
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.680]  and they wanted to be heard because there were some television cameras
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.680]  and people were asking questions.
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:02.680]  So this was their chance to be heard.
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:06.680]  The first group of foreign journalists to come into the city of Homs,
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:10.680]  anybody who claims that they had been here, but be it Al Jazeera, they never were here.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:12.680]  The BBC was never here.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:13.680]  So today we were there.
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:16.680]  So then we were trying to ask them, who is doing this?
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:18.680]  Who are these snipers?
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:22.680]  Well, the first thing you see is that it's a series of random killings.
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:24.680]  It's blind terrorism.
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:26.680]  It's agile provocateur.
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.680]  And they say, look, the thing that we're afraid of is when we go out,
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:34.680]  we're afraid of snipers shooting at us from the ground up.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:35.680]  Sure, stay there, Webster.
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:38.680]  It's the classic thing where it's just a projection.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:42.680]  These hired terror groups just create violence to point at it,
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:45.680]  to point at it and say, see, there's a conflict.
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:50.680]  So it's full spectrum dominance where they create just a conflict
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:53.680]  and then project onto it whatever they want.
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:57.680]  Webster Tarbley from Damascus, Syria will be right back.
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:58.680]  Stay with us.
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:00.680]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:03.680]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:05.680]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:07.680]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:10.680]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:13.680]  It's true, seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:16.680]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:21.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:23.680]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:28.680]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:29.680]  And here's the best part.
[02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:32.680]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:36.680]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.680]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:41.680]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:46.680]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:50.680]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:55.680]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.680]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:02.680]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.

[02:21:53.680 --> 02:22:02.680]  With the economic bad news getting worse each day, are you ready for the hard times ahead?
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:05.680]  This is Alex Jones with a special self-reliance report.
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:10.680]  I've said on this program before that studies show that in a true crisis,
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:19.680]  8 out of 10 people will remain sheep-like and passive, frozen like deer and headlights of an oncoming car waiting for others for help.
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:24.680]  1 out of 10 will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down.
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:30.680]  And only 1 out of 10 will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough,
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:33.680]  dramatically increasing their chances of survival.
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:36.680]  Folks, I've just read a new book called Ready for Anything.
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:41.680]  It's a must-read for anyone who wants to increase their chances of survival in the coming hard times ahead.

[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:05.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:08.680]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:12.680]  Okay, Webster Griffin Tarpley is in Syria.
[02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.680]  He's in the area where they say the uprisings keep originating from.
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:19.680]  Right there where the snipers are shooting people every day.
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:23.680]  No one knows what side they're on. It's all fluid.
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:28.680]  Webster is an expert on false flag provocateur continuing.
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:31.680]  And because I know you're there, you can tell people what's really happening.
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:37.680]  But separately, Webster, then let's look at the larger geopolitical of why this is happening now
[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:41.680]  and what the end game is. Please continue.
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:47.680]  Let me just tell you what these people say. I think this is what's really unique about this.
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:50.680]  You talk to these people. I've talked to all kinds of people.
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:57.680]  An English teacher, a couple of doctors in this hospital, a couple of nurses, French, English, whatever it is.
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:00.680]  And here's what they ask them. Who is doing this?
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:02.680]  And again, it's random killing.
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:05.680]  First of all, they say there's no pattern to what they do.
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:11.680]  They kill Christians. They kill Muslims. Among the Muslims, they kill Sunnis.
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:14.680]  They kill Alawites. They kill others.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:17.680]  They kill people who don't have any particular religious identity.
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:20.680]  They killed members of the army, five terrorists.
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:24.680]  So they got together and killed one soldier in this island neighborhood.
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.680]  So you keep pressing them. You say, alright, who's doing it? Who's doing it?
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:29.680]  And they say, here's where they think it comes from.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:35.680]  The governor says that most of the killers that he sees are actually Syrians.
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:38.680]  But when you talk to the people, they say, yeah, it's true.
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:41.680]  There are Syrians who are doing the shooting.
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:44.680]  But behind them, there's more. And then you say, well, who are they?
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:48.680]  And they say, Saudi Arabia is providing the money.
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:51.680]  Turkey is providing a lot of the help.
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:54.680]  Turkey is not that far from here.
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:00.680]  And then they, how about some more? They say Qatar, right? The wonderful homeland of Al Jazeera television.
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:02.680]  That Qatar is heavily involved.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:08.680]  So it's the same crew that NATO used to soften things up with Qaddafi.
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:11.680]  In Libya, exactly. United Arab Emirates, important.
[02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:17.680]  They also say the Hariri faction of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, the younger.
[02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:21.680]  And they say, watch out for Hariri. His mother is from Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:25.680]  This is a bad apple. Rafiq Hariri is also a part of it.
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.680]  And of course, Lebanon is also very, very, very close.
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:34.680]  And then some of them, if you keep talking, they'll say, yeah, I'm the CIA, of course.
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:41.680]  And Mossad and others, right? NATO, other forces in Europe.
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:47.680]  So they'll also tell you these people are, they're the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.680]  They're people who may have been in Al Qaeda or they're Salafis.
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:58.680]  Salafis is just another brand of this extreme religious fundamentalism.
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:04.680]  Some of them just say those are fundamentalists and anathematizers.
[02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:09.680]  They're religious sectarians who say that everybody's bad except them.
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:16.680]  The governor talked a lot about mafia, organized crime, and you've got the idea of drug pushers.
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:19.680]  So it looks to me like this has been thrown together.
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:27.680]  But the finding that I would have to make at this point, after having really heard a lot of very important first-person testimony,
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:34.680]  this problem is in the hundreds. It's not more than several hundred of these killers.
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.680]  With a certain amount of backup now, how much that is, it's hard to say.
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:43.680]  I asked some very intelligent people in this hospital today, what should the Syrian government do?
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:47.680]  And they say, simple, send more army troops.
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:53.680]  They say, we want soldiers on the roofs of the houses, on the top floors of apartment houses.
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:59.680]  We'd like to have some tanks in the streets, but above all, we'd like to have some soldiers on the roof.
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:04.680]  Because if the soldiers get up on the roof, then the snipers can't go there and they can't do it.
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:09.680]  I was talking to a young woman doctor who was about to walk home.
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.680]  And as she walks home, she's got to worry about getting shot, right?
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:14.680]  You're just getting shot.
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:24.680]  I was shown a picture of a three- or four-year-old girl who was shot dead in an automobile with her mother and her mother little girl.
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:29.680]  Now, there is one exception to this sniper rule, which is the kidnappings do go on.
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:32.680]  And there were significant kidnappings going on.
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:35.680]  The kidnapping is often referred to a murder.
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:41.680]  I visited this group, a bereaved family, and their son had been killed.
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:44.680]  Their son was a taxi driver. These were alleywhites.
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:50.680]  They belonged to the same extra religious group as the Assad family, but these were people.
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.680]  I think I was a taxi driver.
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:56.680]  So he was kidnapped by these, as they said, fundamentalists.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:59.680]  People would be there, this is often what you hear too.
[02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:01.680]  He was kidnapped and then he was murdered.
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:05.680]  In other cases, bodies have been dismembered, they've been cut into dozens of parts.
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:11.680]  There are also stories that I won't go into maybe now, but about the mutilation of women victims.
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:15.680]  Yeah, but let me just stop you. We'll get into that when we come back and you're joining us from Syria.
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.680]  Dr. Webster Tarbley joins us.
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:23.680]  But this is the same story where they was on BBC with the jihadis from Saudi Arabia saying,
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:31.680]  Syria, you're next and running up Al Qaeda flags. So that's who's there. CIA Saudi Arabia has brought him in.
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:35.680]  And, Webster, you're being unpatriotic. An American's duty.
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:38.680]  According to our government's real policies to love Al Qaeda.
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:41.680]  Now, I don't like them either. That's because we're evil.
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:45.680]  And I think you should when we come back, apologize that you're not supporting Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:47.680]  We'll be right back with Webster.
[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:51.680]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:55.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:26.680]  Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:29.680]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:35.680]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:35.680 --> 02:30:38.680]  And it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:38.680 --> 02:30:41.680]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:45.680]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:50.680]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:55.680]  That's www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:33.680]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:36.680]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:38.680]  you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:03.680]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:06.680]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:10.680]  and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:14.680]  Number one, study the past. History really does repeat itself.
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:19.680]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:22.680]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:26.680]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:29.680]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book,
[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:31.680]  Rising Prices, Empty Shelves,
[02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:35.680]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.680]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:32:38.680 --> 02:32:43.680]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:46.680]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival,
[02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:48.680]  how to cut your grocery bills in half.
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.680]  Again, that website is RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:32:53.680 --> 02:33:17.680]  That's RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.
[02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:36.680]  When you want to bomb Iran and Syria,
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:39.680]  relax when you want to mass murder,
[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:43.680]  relax when you want to start World War III.
[02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:48.680]  When you want to mass murder like Hitler, don't do it.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:52.680]  When you want to destroy America's name and bankrupt this worldwide,
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:54.680]  relax, don't do it.
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:58.680]  When you want to go do it, relax.
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:01.680]  All right, we're going back to Webster Tarpley,
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:04.680]  and you know what, I am going to jam some calls in,
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:07.680]  but I'm introducing something other talk show hosts do.
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:10.680]  But instead of radiographies, seven seconds or 10 seconds,
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:13.680]  I will give you 30 seconds and myself 10 seconds
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:16.680]  and take your phone calls when Tarpley leaves us here
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.680]  in about 10 minutes.
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.680]  Remember to join us 800-259-9231.
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:24.680]  And of course, we've only got six phone lines at Genesis.
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.680]  We've got like 100 here, but I'm going to do this in the future
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:29.680]  on my system so we can just bam, bam, bam, go through them.
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.680]  It'll be hard for John to get them as they come in,
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:35.680]  but call now 800-259-9231,
[02:34:35.680 --> 02:34:38.680]  and when you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to get on air.
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:41.680]  That way it makes me shut up and makes me go to your calls.
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:43.680]  I'm going to tell you about a few sponsors.
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:48.680]  EFoodsDirect.com is running a whole bunch of different specials

[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:58.680]  And they've got some specials for the holidays running as well at GussetClothing.com.
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:01.680]  All right, Webster, I'm going to try to shut up now and ask my questions.
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:06.680]  What is the larger geopolitical? You're there doing groundbreaking investigation.
[02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:10.680]  You are some of the only journalists to ever get into that area.
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:13.680]  I've been following it. Nobody's even going or even trying.
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:18.680]  They just sit back and say Assad is roasting children on a pit and maybe Satan,
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:24.680]  and he's also with Al Qaeda. But meanwhile, it's known that Al Qaeda
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:27.680]  works for the New World Order and has been given new fiefdoms.
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:31.680]  Finish up with Syria and then I'm going to ask you, what's the strategy of tension here,
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:36.680]  the order out of chaos? What are they planning to do with Al Qaeda after they give them all these countries?
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:39.680]  I mean, I guess they'll just tell the public, oopsie, Al Qaeda took over.
[02:36:39.680 --> 02:36:42.680]  Now we've got to attack them again. I mean, what's happening here?
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:49.680]  Well, again, just to sum up the findings, the neighborhood of Zahra, Z-A-H-R-A,
[02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:54.680]  in the city of Alms, one million people, this is one of the principal neighborhoods.
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:37:02.680]  It turns out that this entire insurrection comes down to a couple of hundred terrorist snipers
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:09.680]  who are carrying out random shootings and kidnappings in order to terrorize all the relevant groups.
[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:14.680]  Random freedom fighting, though. They're helping people killing them.
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:19.680]  But I mean, this is just like Iraq, where even former top CIA analyst,
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.680]  Raymond Govrens, come on and talked about it later, it came out that the Iraqi government
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:29.680]  with U.S. forces blew up the Golden Mosque to get Shiites and Sunnis killing each other.
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:35.680]  This is a classic, stir up the whole thing, call it a people's rebellion, bomb the whole country,
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:39.680]  and roll in and be praised and have Anderson Cooper, in a nilly way,
[02:37:39.680 --> 02:37:43.680]  prance around on stage talking about democracy.
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:47.680]  It is exactly that kind of a big lie. So a couple of hundred people.
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:52.680]  One thing that I think has to be pointed out, what I found was people supporting Assad.
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:59.680]  They were chanting in favor of President Assad, and they were holding up their own,
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:03.680]  not government manufactured pictures of him, but their own little pictures.
[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:06.680]  And we went in a couple of houses, and there were pictures there, too,
[02:38:06.680 --> 02:38:10.680]  in one of these houses of one of the victims.
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:15.680]  At the same time, there's a criticism of Assad that he hasn't done enough.
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:20.680]  One guy did a very interesting analysis. He said, look, this starts with the CIA,
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:24.680]  it starts with the Mossad, and then it goes through these other groups,
[02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:27.680]  other Arab countries, ethnic groups, criminal elements.
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.680]  And he said, on the whole, the response of the regime has been too tame.
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:35.680]  And again, a couple of doctors and other people in the hospital asked them,
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:40.680]  what should happen here? We want the army. We want more troops in our neighborhood.
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:46.680]  We want this to come to an end, because it's been going on since Friday, March 18th.
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:49.680]  Friday, March 18th. Now, what is it? Seven, eight months ago.
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:54.680]  That was Friday prayers. And one guy said there was a bunch of things on Facebook
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:39:00.680]  saying, go to such and such a square in harm's, and we're going to call for the overthrow of Assad.
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:04.680]  And they get out there. The police is there in small numbers.
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:06.680]  They get to demonstrate for three hours.
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.680]  Then the police say, okay, three hours, it's time for us to go home. Time for you guys to go home.
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:15.680]  So why don't we just call it a day? And they say, no, no, no, we're staying, we're staying.
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:18.680]  And then at a certain point, when the police say, well, wait a minute,
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.680]  why don't you guys move on? And they start to shove them.
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:26.680]  At that point, the demonstrators, in this case, probably the Muslim Brotherhood,
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:29.680]  they pull out knives and they start to stab the cops.
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:32.680]  This is right at the beginning. Friday, the 18th of March.
[02:39:32.680 --> 02:39:36.680]  It was never peaceful. It was never democratic. It was stabbing, right?
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:40.680]  Starting out not with firearms, but with blade weapons.
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.680]  And then the cops respond, not even with gunfire, but with tear gas.
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:50.680]  So that's the start. But right now, it's just this bloodbath.
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.680]  And again, I think the message to Assad from these people that I heard is simply this.
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:40:00.680]  And I'm just reporting what I heard. They support Assad all the way, but they want more troops.
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:03.680]  They want them to do more. They say, this is not enough.
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.680]  It's a little bit too tame what you're doing.
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:08.680]  So this is exactly the opposite of what you're hearing.
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:14.680]  And another way to put it is the reality here is not that the troops are killing civilians.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:17.680]  That's the exception to the rule. It does happen, of course,
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:21.680]  because you get caught in these demonstrations and some civilians get killed.
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.680]  But the thing is that civilians, i.e. terrorists, these people that we've just gone through the catalogue of,
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:32.680]  they're killing the troops. The governor said, I think he said it was 850 people
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:38.680]  that had been killed here in the arms area over the past, you know, six, seven months, whatever it's been.
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:45.680]  And I think he said something like at least 200 have been soldiers.
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:48.680]  So the soldiers are very, very large.
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:53.680]  But of course, NATO and the peace president, they want to liberate with carpet bombing
[02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:59.680]  and leveling of cities and infrastructure so the liberals can all feel very trendy and prance around
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:05.680]  with little, you know, effeminate lists and be big men like Anderson, CIA, Cooper.
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:10.680]  So what's the larger game plan here?
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:16.680]  And how is it going for the forces that want to set the entire Middle East and North Africa ablaze?
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:21.680]  Qaddafi held them up for six months, but now they've got the country to carry out the ethnic cleansing
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.680]  all the way into Africa. That's been admitted. So the mass death and al-Qaeda takeover can now happen.
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:31.680]  But I mean, how's the overall plan of mass murder going?
[02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:37.680]  Just in terms of the neighboring countries, maybe we start with that and then move on to the superpower stuff.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:44.680]  In the neighboring countries, it's very interesting that the centers of such insurrection as there is,
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:47.680]  which is not that much, right? It's nothing like Libya.
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:53.680]  With Libya, there was a whole bunch of cities that were completely lost to Qaddafi from the very beginning, right?
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:58.680]  Benghazi, Ghana, Tobruk, the whole Syrian area was gone within a couple of weeks.
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:06.680]  In this case, it's a couple of neighborhoods or small areas or small towns along four borders.
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:13.680]  Along the Lebanese border, close to it, is Hamz and Hama. That's the other place. Hamz and Hama, Hama being a bit smaller.
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:17.680]  Okay, so that's the Lebanese border. Then you go up to the Turkish border.
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:20.680]  There's an area there where there's some kind of insurrection going on.
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:25.680]  You go over to the Iraq border and there you find that there's something going on.
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:29.680]  It's across from the Iraqi Kurds, right? The Kurdish entity.
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:34.680]  And then there's another area, which is this Daraa, I think it's called.
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:38.680]  That's the Jordan border, right? Jordan is to the south.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:50.680]  So four borders, four foreign countries, it's like each one of the foreign countries has sponsored a center of terrorism and agitation inside this country.
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:43:00.680]  Now, looking beyond it, you have to ask yourself, are you really going to start a regional war for the sake of a couple of hundred terrorist killers?
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:05.680]  Because that's what Hillary Clinton and Ambassador Rice there at the UN said they want to do.
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:15.680]  The difference, of course, is over the weekend, we just had the Arab League blackmailed and bribed, I'm sure, by the United States.
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:23.680]  Say, Syria, you are suspended. Now, tomorrow, Wednesday, the Arab League is meeting, I think, somewhere in Morocco.
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:28.680]  And they're going to say, is that a permanent suspension or is it just a temporary suspension?
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:37.680]  If they can get the Arab League to say that it's suspended, that Syria is suspended, they can go back to the Security Council.
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:44.680]  Because now they can say, up to now, we couldn't get anything through the Security Council against Syria because the Arab League didn't go along with it.
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:50.680]  But now they've suspended Syria, now we can say the Arab League has turned against Syria, they go back and they try it.
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:57.680]  Now, I don't think they'll get anywhere. The Russian Foreign Ministry yesterday said, we don't agree with the stuff that's being done against Syria.
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:01.680]  We're not a part of that. And I think the Chinese probably see it the same way.
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:08.680]  But we have been disappointed by those guys in the past before. So Russia, China had better handcuff.
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:16.680]  But if they don't, then what happened? If you get a bombing campaign here, I can't see how Iran and Hezbollah stay out of this.
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:25.680]  And if they come in, we've had statements in the past couple of weeks where it's pretty clear that the retaliation, even just from Syria,
[02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:29.680]  would go all the way to Israel and it would go deep into Israel.
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.680]  And at that point, you'd get some kind of a regional conflagration effect.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:40.680]  And at that point, the size of the limit, right? Hold on to your hat because then it goes out of control and then nobody knows where it ends.
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.680]  Because it, you know, suppose an aircraft carrier gets sunk or something like this, right?
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:49.680]  And then there has to be retaliation for that and then there has to be counter-retaliation.
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:57.680]  And you get into these scenarios of, you know, runaway, you know, retaliation and God knows what.
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:04.680]  So I think it's really clear, this stuff has to end. The Syrians obviously need to do their part.
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:08.680]  I think these people have a good case that they want more protection from their government.
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:13.680]  But then there's also us, right? The United States has got to butt out of this.
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:20.680]  It's just, it is simply a big lie. In other words, there is no movement against Assad in the way that they say it.
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:22.680]  There is no group that...
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:26.680]  Well, look, look, look, Webster, Webster, we're out of time.
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:30.680]  We're definitely going to have to have you back up the next few days. How long are you in Syria?
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:32.680]  I've got quite a number of days.
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:35.680]  So we can certainly remain something for probably towards the end of the week.
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:43.680]  Yeah, let's, let's get you on Friday is the best day for me. And that way we've got a lot of developments.
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:47.680]  So let me just put you on hold and try to set you up for a good time Friday. How's that sound?
[02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:49.680]  Okay. Okay. Thanks, Alex.
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:51.680]  Webster, Webster, be safe over there.
[02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:55.680]  I'll be right out. We're just talking to a guy from Paris. He listens to you in Paris.
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:58.680]  Well, wonderful. Tell him I said hi.
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:01.680]  He sends these greetings, too.
[02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:06.680]  All right. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, there goes Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:10.680]  I'm going to try to get Salente on today on the nightly news.
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:16.680]  Gerald Salente's gold account was emptied by MF Global. That's up at infowars.com.
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:19.680]  This just went up a few minutes ago. He's on RT about it.
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:25.680]  I've told people I don't like this keeping your gold at some company that holds your gold for you.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:31.680]  I mean, if you've got some of it in the same deposit here, there, and then wherever mixed around and
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.680]  a little burial in the back 40, whatever, then, you know, that's one thing.
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:39.680]  But these companies, you want to take it physical.
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:44.680]  You want to take it physical. That's what Midas Resources recommends.
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:49.680]  And I'm definitely going to get Webster on about this. This is truly disgusting.
[02:46:49.680 --> 02:46:53.680]  We're definitely going to get him on. That's up at infowars.com.
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:59.680]  Also, Ron Paul came in second in the new Iowa big straw poll.
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:03.680]  They spent it to say a new four-way race in Iowa. Ron Paul moves to top tier.
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:05.680]  He's always been the top tier.
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:08.680]  And CBS is only doing that right now because of a firestorm over them.
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:14.680]  Removing the poll when he won two days ago and giving him 99 seconds during the televised part.
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.680]  Okay, during this segment and the next, I'm going to give everybody 30 seconds.
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:21.680]  I have a 10 second comment because I wish I'd give you longer.
[02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:24.680]  But then you know how long when did I am? So let's just go to your calls right now.
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:27.680]  Scott in Texas, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:32.680]  Yes, Alex. The mainstream media is performing a wag the dog.
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:35.680]  Kind of like that movie. You know, it's a false flag.
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:38.680]  Everything they tell us is an absolute lie.
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:41.680]  We should totally not believe the media anymore.
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:46.680]  The lie that Ron Paul can't win. Webster Tarpley's exposing that what's really going on over there
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:50.680]  isn't what we're hearing in the media. The Jessica Lynch story.
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:53.680]  I believe the Gaddafi video was fake.
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:56.680]  I mean, the entire mainstream media apparatus is going for broke.
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:59.680]  And we can't believe anything they say.
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:02.680]  And it's time that we just cancel our cable subscription.
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:07.680]  Stop getting their newspapers. Start exposing that they create these lies.
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:10.680]  And they expect everybody to just believe what they tell us.
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:12.680]  I mean, Herman Cain, let me just say this real quick.
[02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:14.680]  Herman Cain is an Illuminati stooge.
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:17.680]  He comes out with his 666 plan.
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:20.680]  There's a mountain in Israel called Mount Herman where the watchers,
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.680]  the fallen angels of man, the children of Cain, you know, and all this stuff.
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.680]  Listen, I got to let you go because that was more than 40 seconds.
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:34.680]  And I don't have time to comment now. Let's go ahead and go to Stephen in New York.
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:40.680]  Well, first time caller. I've been listening to you for many years.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:44.680]  I want to thank you for the work that you do and tell Lord McBreen.
[02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:47.680]  I said, hello, but I have a quick question for you.
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:55.680]  A couple of months back, Mike Adams had an article with regards to embryos being used as flavoring.
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:49:07.680]  And I read something on the examiner that they were discussing craft Pepsi and Nestle using it in their food.
[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:10.680]  I was wondering if you read anything or had any comments.
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:12.680]  No, I'm going to look that up during the break.
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:14.680]  If you saw it on Mike Adams side, I have no doubt.
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:20.680]  I know that for decades they've used embryos and aborted babies in cosmetic production, not just here,
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:23.680]  but also in France, Europe and over in China.
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:25.680]  So total dehumanization.
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:30.680]  So I'll look into that during the break and come back and cover it for you.
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:34.680]  Thank you so much, Steve, listening to 1310 a.m. in New York.
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:40.680]  Let's go ahead now and take a call from Jason in California.
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:42.680]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:43.680]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:49.680]  Hey, I was listening to Tarpley's radio show this Saturday, World Crisis Radio.
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:56.680]  And he was pretty critical of Ron Paul and his economic plan.
[02:49:56.680 --> 02:50:01.680]  And I thought if you had Tarpley and Paul on at the same time, it'd be a great show.
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:05.680]  Yeah, I don't agree with Tarpley's economic solutions.
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:07.680]  His analysis is spot on.
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:13.680]  I'm against government socialism for the general public and for the big mega banks.
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:16.680]  I understand his point is that's the system we've got.
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:18.680]  So I agree with some of his ideas.
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.680]  Technically, I understand what he's saying.
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:22.680]  It's just it never works.
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:23.680]  I appreciate your call.
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:25.680]  Let's jam in one more.
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:26.680]  Let's talk to Ryan in Wisconsin.
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:28.680]  You're on the air.
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:31.680]  Hey, Alex, long time, first time.
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:34.680]  I was thinking about the chemtrails issue.
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:37.680]  That's the best one to wake people up on.
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:39.680]  It's not a left or right issue.
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:45.680]  And I've had great success of copying what in the world are they spraying and handing those out.
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:47.680]  And also writing on money.
[02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:49.680]  It goes through so many people's hands.
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:55.680]  If you just write on all your bills in fours.com, great way to get it out.
[02:50:55.680 --> 02:50:56.680]  All right, sir.
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:50:58.680]  Great points, by the way.
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:50:59.680]  Stay there.
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:04.680]  Whatever winter activity you enjoy from snowmobiling, snowshoeing, skiing or camping,
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:07.680]  there's inherent danger that you may find yourself having to stay warm.
[02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:12.680]  Be ready with InstaFire, a revolutionary, safe, simple and versatile fire starter.
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:16.680]  InstaFire is a patented blend of volcanic rock, wood pellets and paraffin wax
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:18.680]  that gets a fire blazing in just minutes.
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:22.680]  InstaFire is self-sustaining fire that starts right on top of snow or water
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:24.680]  and even burns wet wood.
[02:51:24.680 --> 02:51:25.680]  Sound incredible?
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:26.680]  It is.
[02:51:26.680 --> 02:51:28.680]  Check it out at InstaFire.com.
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:30.680]  A must for any outdoor winter activity.
[02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:35.680]  InstaFire easily lights with matches or flintlock lighters, is environmentally friendly,
[02:51:35.680 --> 02:51:38.680]  stores easy, is lightweight, comes in a variety of sizes
[02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:44.680]  and starts at a buck 25 for a single pack or only $59.95 for a 5-gallon pail with free shipping.
[02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:48.680]  Go to InstaFire.com, spelled I-N-S-T-A-FIRE.COM
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:51.680]  or call 888-482-4868.
[02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:54.680]  That's 888-482-4868.
[02:51:54.680 --> 02:51:56.680]  Safe, simple, versatile.
[02:51:56.680 --> 02:51:58.680]  InstaFire.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:28.680]  InstaFire.com.
[02:52:57.680 --> 02:53:04.680]  Folks, have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:08.680]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear,
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:12.680]  because there's never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead.
[02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:13.680]  Here's why.
[02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:18.680]  Solar power generators are now available from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:19.680]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:24.680]  Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:27.680]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:30.680]  emits no fumes and produces electricity from the sun.
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:34.680]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own,
[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:37.680]  whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts,
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:40.680]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:42.680]  When the power goes out this winter,
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:46.680]  you'll be ready with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:53:46.680 --> 02:53:49.680]  Go to MySolarBackup.com for more information.
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:55.680]  That's MySolarBackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:07.680]  Well, we have nothing left to lose.
[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:09.680]  It turns out this came out five months ago.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:12.680]  It's all over mainstream news, but buried.
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:14.680]  It's all over natural news.
[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:17.680]  It's all over life-sites news.
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:19.680]  And Pepsi admits it.
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:23.680]  Their flavoring is fetuses.
[02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:28.680]  I just meant you cannot make up the level of evil of the New World Order.
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:31.680]  And I'm sure something else is going on with that,
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:34.680]  that they've weaponized food against us.
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:36.680]  And people always think,
[02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:38.680]  why aren't you covering this, Alex?
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:40.680]  Because I didn't know this.
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:45.680]  That's the point I'm making is that I can't even handle
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:48.680]  how crazy this is getting.
[02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:53.680]  I'm telling you, I mean, heaven help us.
[02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:56.680]  I can't even, I don't even know how to respond at this point.
[02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:58.680]  We've got a big geo-engineering chem trail,
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:01.680]  globalist assault special tonight, 7 o'clock,
[02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:04.680]  probably the most important info we've ever covered on the Nightly News.
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:07.680]  There's a 15-day free trial if you're not a prison-planet.tv member.
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:10.680]  Let it go up there and become a member.
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:13.680]  And again, you can download all the films, everything,
[02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:16.680]  get them out to people, and then just cancel your membership if you don't want it.
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:19.680]  15 days, please support us, become a prison-planet.tv member.
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:22.680]  No excuse tonight, watch the show.
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:24.680]  And I'll obviously cover the fetal stuff tonight, too.
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:27.680]  I didn't even, this has been out five months, and I didn't know.
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:29.680]  Was that Ryan just brought that up or somebody else?
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:33.680]  Ryan, you had, you only had 20 seconds, you got 15 more, go ahead.
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:37.680]  All right, just like I was saying, the chem trail is a good issue
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:40.680]  because it's not left or right, so people can't say,
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:43.680]  oh, you're a Republican or you're a Democrat.
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:46.680]  You just go out on a day to spray in your town, copy what in the world do they spray,
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:50.680]  and point up when people say, what's going on, you say, well, here's the answer.
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:52.680]  And then the copy, you're done.
[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:55.680]  That's right, and putting websites on money is also very effective.
[02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:59.680]  If our millions of listeners did that, it would really cause the globalist to heart attack.
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:03.680]  Everybody wrote in force.com, I'm not saying do that, of course.
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:07.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marvin in North Carolina,
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:10.680]  because, you know, they're just putting fetuses in your Pepsi.
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:13.680]  I mean, what's the problem? We shouldn't write on money to warn people
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:17.680]  or get upset about that, because, you know, they're just turning us into a commodity,
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:19.680]  chopped up babies, got to do something with them anyways.
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:22.680]  We're the extremists for not liking it, I admit.
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:25.680]  Marvin in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:27.680]  Alex, how in the world are you?
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:31.680]  Well, I'm a bad person because I don't like fetus flavoring.
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:33.680]  Neither do I, Alex, but check this out.
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:37.680]  I work for a recycling company here in North Carolina.
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:43.680]  I drive the roll-off truck that hauls the compactor cans to the dump.
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:48.680]  And we've got a new clock system where when we punch hands,
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:52.680]  they scan our hands as though we're working for NASA or somebody.
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:53.680]  What do you think of that?
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:56.680]  It is training you to bioscan to buy and sell,
[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:59.680]  and then even if you have cash, it'll track everything you do.
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:03.680]  And if you're not a good globalist, and Homeland Security now admits this,
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:07.680]  in the future, you won't be able to have a job or be able to buy or sell anything.
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:08.680]  Not the Bible saying this.
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:11.680]  They're saying it, and they will turn your scan off,
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:14.680]  and then either they'll be told, don't serve you,
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:17.680]  or they'll then dispatch people to arrest you.
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:19.680]  It is a total grid, and they're going to put in prison.
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:23.680]  Anybody that has an underground garden who helps people,
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:26.680]  hell is now being released, my friend.
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:30.680]  I figured that. I just wanted to get your take on it.
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:33.680]  Alex, keep up the good work and keep the information coming.
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:37.680]  Yes, sir. When you go to SeaWorld, you go to Disney World,
[02:57:37.680 --> 02:57:39.680]  you've got a scan to get in now.
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:42.680]  And guess what? My kids have never gone since then.
[02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:44.680]  I mean, but it doesn't matter.
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:48.680]  They're taking, you don't want to fly because it's having your genitals cropped.
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:51.680]  They're just setting them up on the highways now.
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:54.680]  They're not stopping. They're criminals. They're hardcore.
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:57.680]  They're pedophiles. They're scum. They're filth. They're murderers.
[02:57:57.680 --> 02:57:59.680]  Oh, they made me sick.
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:01.680]  Steven New York, your last caller we got time for.
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:03.680]  Go ahead. Sorry to the others.
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:06.680]  Hi, Alex. Thank you very much for taking my call,
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:08.680]  and very excellent work that you're doing.
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:11.680]  On the topic of Chemtrail, House of Representatives,
[02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:15.680]  October 2, 2001, by Representative Dennis Cassinage,
[02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:18.680]  HR 2977, read it.
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:21.680]  It tells you about Chemtrail, Dennis, what they can and cannot do.
[02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:24.680]  In addition to being introduced to bill, Europe has a law against it,
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:27.680]  unless it's authorized by the secret committee.
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:29.680]  And I'll cover it tonight. Anything else, sir?
[02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:33.680]  Or your listeners to check it out in the Library of Congress.
[02:58:33.680 --> 02:58:47.680]  All right, good job. Good job. I'm out of time. See you back tonight, tonight, 7.
