[01:51.760 --> 01:55.840]  not to the bunker but to the parapets defend the republic
[01:55.840 --> 01:59.520]  after the bunker sign we're not in the bunker

[02:03.120 --> 02:06.480]  awesome audience that are the second wave of the second

[02:24.960 --> 02:29.120]  finally announce that after holdups and globalist attempts to stop us
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.040]  then about a month we're going to add three more hours of broadcast today
[02:33.040 --> 02:35.840]  and then hopefully a few months after that three more hours

[02:43.760 --> 02:47.920]  24 hours a day but that's why your support
[02:47.920 --> 02:51.360]  and your word of mouth is not just paramount it is
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.960]  absolutely essential like fish need water to live humans need oxygen to live
[02:56.960 --> 03:00.800]  trees need carbon dioxide you are the resistance
[03:00.800 --> 03:06.720]  okay stunningly incredible news i've got so much to cover
[03:06.720 --> 03:10.400]  that i have four gas scheduled and i'm tempted to cancel them
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.200]  except they're all super informative millie weaver
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.840]  and others uh katlyn benet were at a bernie sanders event today
[03:19.840 --> 03:24.640]  when a provocateur running around wearing a red make america gradient hat
[03:24.640 --> 03:27.520]  was screaming the n word
[03:27.520 --> 03:30.960]  and they're trying to process the video now and get it to us
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.360]  but that's what's going on and of course it's a small it of course it staged
[03:35.360 --> 03:38.960]  remember when rand paul was running for the senate in kentucky
[03:38.960 --> 03:42.640]  and when we broke this we used google searches to do it
[03:42.640 --> 03:47.760]  they had people in overalls coveralls overalls and coveralls with literal
[03:47.760 --> 03:51.840]  pieces of hay in their mouth and in going i'm not going to even say it or
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.840]  they'll cut out a context say i said it but we don't lack the such and such
[03:55.840 --> 04:01.040]  as we don't lack the and i but rand paul's a good kkk man and
[04:01.040 --> 04:05.120]  where with him and i remember sitting in there
[04:05.120 --> 04:09.200]  it was a don salazar and i said don's like this is totally staged he showed me
[04:09.200 --> 04:11.920]  another clip in houston and somebody else pulling a similar thing who was a
[04:11.920 --> 04:14.880]  democrat and i said yeah blow up that guy's face google
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.400]  searching with a google search you can do that that'd be the exact image you
[04:18.400 --> 04:21.840]  just cut the face out and it'll get it most of the time google has face
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.960]  recognition this was even six years ago
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.880]  and it pulled up that he worked in the other guy's campaign as a senior person
[04:30.880 --> 04:37.360]  he's out there going i'm with the kkk and i like rand paul
[04:37.360 --> 04:41.120]  and they just did it again at this bernie rally they're popping in with that
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.960]  a huge new caravan rampaged over the Mexican border coming this way
[04:44.960 --> 04:48.800]  and the democrats now suddenly say the border crisis is real but wait
[04:48.800 --> 04:52.480]  after denying it was happening denying caravans existed
[04:52.480 --> 04:59.680]  now it's trumps fault yes he created it he did it all that's right
[04:59.680 --> 05:03.600]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[05:03.600 --> 05:06.880]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[05:06.880 --> 05:10.400]  but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be
[05:10.400 --> 05:15.520]  concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[05:15.520 --> 05:18.800]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the
[05:18.800 --> 05:23.440]  water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[05:23.440 --> 05:28.880]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact
[05:28.880 --> 05:32.720]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[05:32.720 --> 05:36.560]  next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.080]  and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[05:40.080 --> 05:43.760]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[05:43.760 --> 05:48.720]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water
[05:48.720 --> 05:53.200]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[05:53.200 --> 05:56.800]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water
[05:56.800 --> 06:00.720]  filtration system will purify it
[06:01.920 --> 06:08.080]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you lie from the front
[06:08.080 --> 06:19.600]  lines of the info war
[06:19.600 --> 06:24.400]  ladies and gentlemen incredible things are happening populism nationalism is
[06:24.400 --> 06:27.920]  coming back to life dolman sacks has had to come up with a
[06:27.920 --> 06:32.000]  regular analysis and admitted that trump all the evidence shows is going to win
[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  the election in 2020 something we already do
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.320]  except for one plays in lining on that silver cloud
[06:40.320 --> 06:44.240]  talk about it a moment the rest of the story is paul harvey would say
[06:44.240 --> 06:48.080]  a story is up on drudgerport.com goldman sacks trump reelection likely
[06:48.080 --> 06:50.800]  but before i get back to that let me mention the other news coming up
[06:50.800 --> 06:54.320]  what's wrong with this picture right here
[06:54.320 --> 06:58.160]  your radio listener stories posted up on info wars.com
[06:58.160 --> 07:02.400]  from the la times putting american flags on police cars
[07:02.400 --> 07:06.880]  sparks backlash in laguna beach yes people don't like
[07:06.880 --> 07:10.160]  seeing american flags and the reason they've got to be brought out
[07:10.160 --> 07:13.600]  is they're demonizing the american flag the democratic party has officially
[07:13.600 --> 07:16.480]  come out and said many of their leaders get rid of it
[07:16.480 --> 07:20.240]  it's a racist evil symbol america was never great
[07:20.240 --> 07:23.680]  it'll never be great double the quomo of new york
[07:23.680 --> 07:26.480]  this is their culture this is the globalist model
[07:26.480 --> 07:29.920]  get rid of the country we'll be getting into
[07:29.920 --> 07:34.480]  that we're going to also get into the one of the biggest stories
[07:34.480 --> 07:37.680]  and this was all over youtube and all over the place
[07:37.680 --> 07:41.600]  on facebook yesterday it's been taken down
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.680]  we have a low res copy of it but but this is already about to air
[07:45.680 --> 07:51.200]  this is airing on cbs television anti trump show faces backlash for inciting
[07:51.200 --> 07:54.480]  violence against conservatives says any trump supporter is a
[07:54.480 --> 07:58.880]  nazi and should be physically attacked that's how the democrats
[07:58.880 --> 08:02.480]  operate jamie white wrote a story about it for info wars dot com
[08:02.480 --> 08:06.560]  cbs tv show advocates using political violence
[08:06.560 --> 08:09.680]  and encourages black people to go out and attack white people
[08:09.680 --> 08:14.960]  and of course they are cbs minnesota uh reporting on their successful operation
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.160]  man charged with throwing child from third floor balcony
[08:18.160 --> 08:21.120]  at mall of america you have to read the police report to find out they're
[08:21.120 --> 08:24.320]  looking at is the hate crime because of what the man screamed and through the
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.600]  small white child over the side imagine if a white person had
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.800]  thrown a white child five or three floors down
[08:36.800 --> 08:40.800]  five-year-old imagine how insane it would be it would be a racial attack but
[08:40.800 --> 08:43.840]  when a black person does it no it's not because the media
[08:43.840 --> 08:48.720]  is pushing this pushing violence towards americans on twitter
[08:48.720 --> 08:52.960]  period john bennett's a powerful report up on info wars dot com and news wars
[08:52.960 --> 08:55.440]  dot com i hope you'll get we're gonna be playing that
[08:55.440 --> 09:00.320]  russia says new world order being formed and that the west is going tyrannical
[09:00.320 --> 09:03.200]  and getting rid of free speech and destroying the renaissance
[09:03.200 --> 09:06.720]  and that people should stand against it and putin has come out and said he
[09:06.720 --> 09:10.320]  supports internet freedom that's right you cannot
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.960]  make this up that is coming up meanwhile
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.560]  roiders ap they're all reporting a new cold war has begun
[09:18.560 --> 09:21.520]  and the u.s is encircling russia with nuclear weapons
[09:21.520 --> 09:24.640]  uh and that's very dangerous for world peace
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.320]  and swallows well with no evidence the facts of the contrary the Mueller
[09:28.320 --> 09:31.280]  reports this trump did nothing and no connections russia
[09:31.280 --> 09:35.680]  the democrats are totally connected to russia and china and others
[09:35.680 --> 09:39.280]  is saying no trump is a russian agent and works for them
[09:39.280 --> 09:45.360]  this man is an anti-american disgrace remember when tucker carlson last
[09:45.360 --> 09:49.920]  year was defending rand paul whose senator john mccain had
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.240]  called a russian agent on the floor because he voted against bombing russian
[09:54.240 --> 09:57.280]  troops in syria who were pushing isis and al-qaeda
[09:57.280 --> 10:01.840]  and al-nuzra out swallows well told
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.080]  to carlson well you work for putin too
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.600]  quote you work for putin too what an outrageous statement
[10:11.600 --> 10:15.360]  what an incredible statement when swallows well is connected to the
[10:15.360 --> 10:18.400]  democrats that hate america say they want to get rid of the country they
[10:18.400 --> 10:21.040]  hate american flags they hate the bill of rights they hate the
[10:21.040 --> 10:24.640]  military they hate police they say the country sucks
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.720]  my god all the democrats are electing is a bunch of crazy muslim women
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.160]  they want to cut their daughters genitals off and say that 9-11 people
[10:32.160 --> 10:36.640]  you know did something it's insane
[10:37.520 --> 10:40.320]  and by the way people say oh that's out of context now i watched the whole speech
[10:40.320 --> 10:44.080]  she gave other speeches that we played here i don't make a documentary about
[10:44.080 --> 10:46.880]  her like a short quick 10 minute one
[10:46.880 --> 10:50.160]  on all the interviews she did and why she's an islamic leader in this country
[10:50.160 --> 10:53.440]  because the radical islamic sister funding her
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.480]  i've seen her say that islamic terrorism is something we shouldn't be ashamed of
[10:58.480 --> 11:01.600]  and that and that well the west does all these bad things so this is just a form
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.360]  of warfare back i mean she's on record if the president wants to put out some
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.800]  videos on her her saying these people that did something
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.400]  and the crowd laughs that's nothing this woman
[11:12.400 --> 11:18.080]  defends terror she hates america she defends communism in venezuela
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.840]  she is a dirt bag period all right i'm gonna stop right there
[11:23.840 --> 11:29.760]  i'm gonna just settle down for a minute let me tell you what else is coming up
[11:29.760 --> 11:32.160]  let me tell you what else is coming up by the way i'd love to have a bunch of
[11:32.160 --> 11:39.040]  brown women getting elected to congress like kandace owens smart honorable
[11:39.040 --> 11:46.400]  good-looking savvy charismatic why is it all this
[11:46.400 --> 11:50.000]  all the patriot brown women are really pretty on top of it and then you've got
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.560]  all these leftist weird crazy-eyed harpies just like the white women look
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.720]  like crazy demons hillary clinton elizabeth warren all a bunch of weird
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.520]  sick women going against their own design against families against children
[12:03.520 --> 12:08.640]  promoting post-birth abortion sounds like the name of a death metal band
[12:08.640 --> 12:12.960]  or a book written by a serial killer once you walk up and blow some politicians
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.480]  head off you say hey it's post-birth abortion
[12:16.480 --> 12:20.320]  i'm not saying do that i'm saying post-birth abortion is called
[12:20.320 --> 12:25.200]  killing somebody it's called murder and we already know it is with a baby
[12:25.200 --> 12:28.240]  they trick people they do it i'm not saying you're guilty if you had an
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.680]  abortion you got tricked into it it's the heart that god judges but
[12:31.680 --> 12:35.600]  now it's post-birth we keep the babies comfortable
[12:35.600 --> 12:39.200]  and we harvest the organs i'm the virginia governor
[12:39.200 --> 12:42.800]  and when i'm not in blackface or a kkk outfit
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.200]  i want the organs for myself
[12:48.640 --> 12:53.360]  hillary calls it up to birth abortion even though it's more invasive to kill
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.480]  the baby inside with salts and then chop it up
[12:56.480 --> 13:02.560]  because they want the organs they want want the organs
[13:02.560 --> 13:08.000]  so that's coming up today there's just so much here ladies and gentlemen but cbs
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.600]  is running a new tv show about black people
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.480]  going out and fighting these imaginary racist groups that are everywhere
[13:18.480 --> 13:21.200]  and then everybody knows if you're a conservative a nationals a patriot
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.560]  around the street f u nazi f u russian agents so now they're
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.000]  going to segue them out of russia into your all just nazis
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.800]  so the audio and the video of that is coming up just outrageous
[13:32.800 --> 13:36.480]  but the biggest news of all this insane news
[13:36.480 --> 13:39.760]  we're going to cover it more when we come back and then we have three and
[13:39.760 --> 13:43.040]  formed the ladies joining us katelyn Bennett
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.720]  millie weaver laura loomer on three separate subjects this hour
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.720]  then the jewish conservative australian
[13:50.720 --> 13:54.720]  who was set up by comedy central they edited tapes together to have him
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.800]  supporting white supremacy needs to show him he said that he was going to be
[13:58.800 --> 14:02.880]  coming to the united states on a speaking tour to expose the truth
[14:02.880 --> 14:06.640]  he was banned by the fbi and homeland security saying that he
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.600]  basically wanted to come and kill the other talk show host
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.120]  jim jeffreys because he'd been in special operations in the
[14:17.120 --> 14:20.080]  israeli defense force
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.200]  avi will be joining us coming up the next hour and again i wish i would have
[14:25.200 --> 14:27.600]  videotaped megan kelly because she did the same thing to me
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.040]  she'd take something i said 10 minutes before and it's a totally different
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.120]  question or answer and he's he caught him got like 10 million views
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.240]  the answer was on facebook to banning twitter to shadow banning
[14:38.240 --> 14:44.160]  and then now homeland security and the fbi like we're england now where they
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.400]  banned michael sabbage and all these other people
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.120]  now you get here in lax and you're going to try to go
[14:51.120 --> 14:53.680]  just simply
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.880]  go on some shows go on this show go on dav rubin show go on c mcrowder show
[14:58.880 --> 15:02.560]  go probably go into a rogan show i hope Joe rogan's interested in this
[15:02.560 --> 15:05.520]  and you're just banned sorry you don't get to come here and counter comedy
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.280]  central it's too scary that we edited this to create a race war we're not
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.400]  going to let you but as i said the big news is
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.240]  hostile and aggressive migrants break through border into southern Mexico
[15:16.240 --> 15:22.480]  joined us bound massive caravan now up to 100 000 people but wait for it
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.640]  the democrats i have all these clips coming up now officially say
[15:26.640 --> 15:30.640]  that the border is a crisis in an emergency but that trump
[15:30.640 --> 15:35.600]  did it bill marr said it friday uh the democrats are all saying it quarry
[15:35.600 --> 15:38.880]  booker admits releasing migrants and sanctuary cities would make us less
[15:38.880 --> 15:41.840]  safe meanwhile they want to release in your town
[15:41.840 --> 15:47.040]  us house democrats blame trump for worsening border crisis
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.440]  because the truth is they bust them to red cities
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.840]  and to the midwest and to texas and to michigan and to minnesota and just

[20:28.480 --> 20:37.520]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[20:37.520 --> 20:45.840]  remember what jonathan and groober said six years ago when they were finally
[20:45.840 --> 20:51.360]  getting obama care into place he said my job was to
[20:51.360 --> 20:54.480]  triple the price of health care and screw everyone so that big banks and
[20:54.480 --> 20:57.920]  insurance companies made money for a decade then we would bankrupt health
[20:57.920 --> 21:01.600]  care and bring in single payer which would then be administered
[21:01.600 --> 21:05.360]  by only three insurance companies cutting out thousands of others it's a
[21:05.360 --> 21:10.240]  monopolistic consolidation a zql a manual
[21:10.240 --> 21:14.240]  then went on fox news the other major architect
[21:14.240 --> 21:18.480]  and said yes we're planning to bankrupt health care and bring in single payer
[21:18.480 --> 21:22.080]  but not your grandma's failed socialism a crony capitalist
[21:22.080 --> 21:27.680]  fascist surveillance capitalism using communism
[21:27.680 --> 21:33.680]  that's right so that's what's unfolding
[21:34.320 --> 21:39.680]  right now is that they hope we don't have any memory
[21:39.680 --> 21:43.600]  groober went on to say thank god the average american
[21:43.600 --> 21:50.480]  has the memory of a goldfish actually the average american has a great memory
[21:50.480 --> 21:55.600]  about game of thrones or the nfl or major league baseball or where
[21:55.600 --> 22:00.880]  women want to get their lashes done or you know a vacation you went on when
[22:00.880 --> 22:07.040]  people are focused and pay attention to something
[22:07.040 --> 22:12.000]  they remember it but groober said you're too stupid to understand it
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.040]  so he went on c-span and called you dumb i probably played the clips a hundred
[22:17.040 --> 22:21.120]  times should i play them again but you guys just found one of the clips where
[22:21.120 --> 22:23.840]  he said you're you're stupid and you have no memory
[22:23.840 --> 22:28.720]  you want me to play that for you imagine the arrogance
[22:29.200 --> 22:37.600]  the hood spa the bravada the the the the the hubris
[22:37.600 --> 22:44.240]  to go on television and be an mit professor and braggins say obama hired
[22:44.240 --> 22:48.400]  me to deceive everyone they're so stupid and the the phd's are all clapping
[22:48.400 --> 22:51.680]  because they go to college now to learn how to hurt people
[22:51.680 --> 22:56.240]  you go to journalism school now to learn how to kill truth and censor
[22:56.240 --> 22:58.560]  that's what journalists do that have journalist degrees now they're the
[22:58.560 --> 23:02.880]  priest class they go out and they destroy unauthorized
[23:02.880 --> 23:08.960]  press that's the new york times the washington post cnn that's what they do
[23:08.960 --> 23:12.640]  and they tell you you're dumb and i'm lying to you and i'm gonna
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.360]  ask you over and you're gonna beg for it
[23:17.360 --> 23:21.680]  we're not gonna use any lubricant here we're gonna put a
[23:21.680 --> 23:24.800]  sandpaper condom on before we do this i don't mean to be gross here but
[23:24.800 --> 23:30.480]  that's what they're doing that's who they are
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.240]  and so why do i raise that subject of of you having no memory you do have a
[23:34.240 --> 23:37.760]  memory this audience has a memory a memory of the republic a memory of the
[23:37.760 --> 23:40.000]  future a memory of what we were building and the
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.960]  renaissance that they fear i don't disrespect you i love you i want to
[23:44.960 --> 23:48.080]  empower you because if my children are gonna have a future your children need
[23:48.080 --> 23:51.600]  a future we're in this together as benjamin franklin said
[23:51.600 --> 23:55.440]  we're gonna hang together hang separate
[23:57.760 --> 24:03.360]  hang together and win or hang by our damn necks
[24:03.360 --> 24:07.680]  the globalist think humanity's beaten i know the score you're not
[24:07.680 --> 24:11.040]  i sure know i'm not and i sure know i've been fighting hard i sure know all i've
[24:11.040 --> 24:14.800]  had is victory even though sometimes it looks dark because i've got will
[24:14.800 --> 24:19.360]  and god's spirit in my sales and they know we've got the spirit to set the
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.760]  brush fires that defeats them so why did i just spend four minutes
[24:23.760 --> 24:27.120]  intro i'm about to say because you got a memory
[24:27.120 --> 24:30.720]  you got a memory and as soon as i have a bigger crew and we have a limited five
[24:30.720 --> 24:34.080]  six people in on the weekend usually on saturday and sunday we have more than
[24:34.080 --> 24:39.520]  that in production on weekdays as soon as i get here in the morning
[24:39.520 --> 24:42.640]  i'm gonna go in and i'm gonna go to my researchers and i'm gonna say
[24:42.640 --> 24:46.720]  i want you to pull me don't go too far because they'll take them too long
[24:46.720 --> 24:52.560]  i'll say you got an hour i want ten clips
[24:52.560 --> 24:58.880]  of msnbc cnn abc all of them saying trump's crazy there is no border crisis
[24:58.880 --> 25:05.040]  the crisis is fake and there's no caravans we've got a costa and we've
[25:05.040 --> 25:07.440]  got uh jake tapper i mean right off the top of
[25:07.440 --> 25:10.640]  my head and i'll sit there while i'll tell him get jake tapper get a cost i'll
[25:10.640 --> 25:14.720]  give him a few others now obviously you've all seen it you
[25:14.720 --> 25:18.720]  you have a memory this audience thousands of times
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.800]  i mean every time i turn the radio on or tv it's like there is no border crisis
[25:22.800 --> 25:26.000]  there are no caravans nothing's happening
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.520]  george soros isn't funding it it's totally made up nothing
[25:29.520 --> 25:33.760]  nothing's going on they've done focus groups now
[25:33.760 --> 25:36.560]  and know that democrats are totally turning against them
[25:36.560 --> 25:39.520]  and know that millions are pouring in hundreds of thousands a month that
[25:39.520 --> 25:42.320]  they're catching they people know diseases coming in
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.520]  smuggled kids they know it's all mostly military age men
[25:45.520 --> 25:48.560]  they see kids being drugged through barbed wire as human shields
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.680]  democrats are pissed people are awake they know the third world is being
[25:51.680 --> 25:55.920]  brought in not to help the third world but to lower us the third world
[25:55.920 --> 25:58.880]  so this is footage from a tv viewer from last year
[25:58.880 --> 26:02.240]  the news is more giant caravans even bigger
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.160]  just hit today there's some of that footage hostile and aggressive migrants
[26:06.160 --> 26:10.800]  break through border into southern mexico join us bound caravan and now
[26:10.800 --> 26:14.800]  kori booker and the democrats and even um
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.360]  bernie sanders says illegals are bankrupting our social services and we
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.080]  can't bring more in so they're at least having to say
[26:22.080 --> 26:25.920]  rhetorically so is bill marn stop saying that there aren't caravans
[26:25.920 --> 26:29.440]  stop saying there isn't a crisis there is a crisis you're killing
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.560]  the party and the democrats in the show go no
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.200]  he's got kids in cages and he's in the kkk and there's no caravan
[26:37.200 --> 26:41.920]  and marn looks at her and says lady
[26:41.920 --> 26:46.080]  you're killing me of course there's caravans of course the border's
[26:46.080 --> 26:49.120]  collapsing people are scared by the way that was all over
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.720]  youtube they took it all down before we could even grab it but i i've got the
[26:52.720 --> 26:55.600]  transcript of it because there were articles written about it and if you've
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.560]  got a dvr on hbo you saw it but but they're now going okay
[27:00.560 --> 27:04.640]  there are caravans it's a crisis it's a problem but remember they said there
[27:04.640 --> 27:09.120]  wasn't a crisis there wasn't a problem and then here's the next piece though
[27:09.120 --> 27:12.560]  you're like democrat talking points to tell the truth
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.200]  oh yeah because they're now saying trump caused the crisis
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.360]  type in to google you know the big nsa spy on your search engine
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.400]  type in trump caused border crisis thousands of articles the last three
[27:26.400 --> 27:30.000]  days so remember if you have a memory
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.240]  you're like wait a minute you said there wasn't a crisis there wasn't a caravan
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.800]  it wasn't existing it wasn't going on
[27:40.080 --> 27:44.640]  now in the space of two weeks you go there is a crisis there are caravans
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.160]  and it's trump trump did it trump trump did it
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.320]  are you not insulted by that type of behavior
[27:54.320 --> 27:58.960]  we're gonna go out to break here we come back i'm gonna play the quarry booker
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.720]  and all the rest of it if you're a tv viewer you're seeing all of this
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.200]  but quarry booker admits releasing migrants into sanctuary cities would
[28:07.200 --> 28:10.400]  make us less safe
[28:10.400 --> 28:16.480]  roiders u.s house democrats blame trump for worsening border crisis
[28:17.200 --> 28:20.160]  they're saying because he cut funding to central america it's making it worse he
[28:20.160 --> 28:22.320]  just did that last week these caravans are already here
[28:22.320 --> 28:26.400]  he's been giving them money billions and they had to fix it the definition of
[28:26.400 --> 28:30.880]  insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting another result
[28:30.880 --> 28:34.480]  so they think you're an idiot they think you have no memory they think you're
[28:34.480 --> 28:38.880]  stupid and you know what i put all my chips that you're not stupid i put all
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.920]  my chips on the line that you're not done
[28:41.920 --> 28:45.760]  and you want freedom like i did i'm betting on you
[28:45.760 --> 28:50.000]  are you betting on me and judging by the response
[28:50.000 --> 28:58.960]  i know you are we are unstoppable if we just pass the attack
[28:58.960 --> 29:03.040]  there are thousands of ideologies out there hundreds of different political
[29:03.040 --> 29:06.720]  systems and most of them are funded by the globalist
[29:06.720 --> 29:10.080]  info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.120]  that's why the globalists are obsessed with it trying to shut it down
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.280]  i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance americana
[29:17.280 --> 29:21.280]  and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring it back
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.120]  and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.560]  that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[29:28.560 --> 29:33.120]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine

[33:54.880 --> 33:58.400]  bike trail people stop me and they go man i used to
[33:58.400 --> 34:02.480]  love it when you were on youtube or itunes or facebook i used to watch
[34:02.480 --> 34:04.960]  your show every day i used to be subscribed and then
[34:04.960 --> 34:08.800]  they deleted it all so i couldn't even you know go to you i
[34:08.800 --> 34:12.960]  how are you doing now that you're off air and these are smart people that tune
[34:12.960 --> 34:16.640]  in i always look at them and i say we're at info wars.com
[34:16.640 --> 34:20.160]  we're at news wars.com it's like drudgerport.com is bigger than all
[34:20.160 --> 34:24.320]  other sites out there not just news it's the second largest
[34:24.320 --> 34:27.120]  site in the world it's the biggest news site in the world
[34:27.120 --> 34:30.000]  and and i guess people would ask matt drudge if matt drudge wanted to start a
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.480]  daily 30 minute video vlog but people say oh matt you've got the
[34:34.480 --> 34:40.240]  biggest website in the world for news do you have a show
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.440]  i mean info wars has millions of visitors info wars news wars millions
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.200]  every day we have millions of people watch the videos
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.080]  listen to the streams and then i read vanity fair last week and the
[34:54.080 --> 34:57.360]  london guardian just last week thank god jones is
[34:57.360 --> 35:02.160]  off air i guess people believe that crap we're on
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.560]  over 200 radio stations we're on over 100 tv stations cable
[35:06.560 --> 35:09.520]  stations and expanding it's actually more than that
[35:09.520 --> 35:12.880]  we're getting like mainline big tv stations to pick us up
[35:12.880 --> 35:18.160]  in major cities and the people watching know we're on
[35:18.160 --> 35:21.360]  but there's this idea that if you're not on youtube google
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.920]  or facebook or twitter you don't exist i routinely
[35:25.920 --> 35:33.200]  trend number one on twitter even though i'm banned from twitter
[35:33.200 --> 35:41.040]  and it's not about me sitting here and bitching and complaining about that
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.240]  or trying to say oh i'm still big even though no one thinks it's that
[35:44.240 --> 35:50.000]  imagine the idea that we only think we exist if we're on youtube
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.960]  facebook twitter or being promoted by google of course that's all gained
[35:54.960 --> 35:58.240]  of course it's incredibly corrupt of course they're censoring everybody
[35:58.240 --> 36:02.080]  and so the answer is build our own systems like we've done
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.560]  we knew this was coming but the listeners listening
[36:06.560 --> 36:09.520]  they're like people don't know they go to info wars dot com
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.680]  our news wars dot com our prison planet dot com or paul wasis great site he's
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.560]  launched summit dot news
[36:18.560 --> 36:22.480]  the answer is what matt drudge has said for 15 years
[36:22.480 --> 36:25.680]  what he said in here three years ago in the studio he's
[36:25.680 --> 36:30.400]  only done one interview since then there's like one interview every two years
[36:30.400 --> 36:34.080]  i'm very honored to have his last big interview because that was like a little
[36:34.080 --> 36:38.000]  15 minute thing on a radio show he came here right there in the dark with a
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.480]  mobile mic and talked for 45 minutes and it was all
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.600]  like prophecy it all came true about the censorship the purge he says how many
[36:47.600 --> 36:50.560]  sunsets will you see you know how many
[36:50.560 --> 36:54.400]  how many moon rises
[36:54.800 --> 37:01.200]  and here we are now ladies and gentlemen
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.080]  and he said just a decade ago most of the web was independent sites you surfed
[37:06.080 --> 37:09.280]  to different places saw different designs different people different things
[37:09.280 --> 37:12.800]  now everything is kept on the cloud here or there
[37:12.800 --> 37:16.240]  and it's all four or five big sites and then they control what you do
[37:16.240 --> 37:21.360]  and they watch what you do and they sell your data
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.720]  just came out last week that
[37:24.880 --> 37:30.480]  amazon's alexa has real people listening to you on it of course it does and all
[37:30.480 --> 37:34.480]  those systems do that you know the power of being able to have bugs inside
[37:34.480 --> 37:38.560]  people's houses to know their secrets and to sell the marketing data
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.720]  i mean billionaires and rich people that are dumb enough to actually have
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.120]  ai systems in their houses with keywords alerts
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.240]  people i mean if someone's a successful talk show host or a movie star
[37:50.240 --> 37:54.240]  and you're dumb enough to put a google assistant or
[37:54.240 --> 37:59.760]  amazon alexa in your house you've probably got five ten people full time
[37:59.760 --> 38:02.720]  listening and watching and tracking you because you're an interesting and
[38:02.720 --> 38:05.840]  important person and what you think and trends you're involved in and what
[38:05.840 --> 38:08.000]  movies you're going to make or what you're going to do is incredibly
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.680]  valuable see you you have locks on your doors not
[38:11.680 --> 38:15.360]  that you're hiding something not that you've done
[38:15.360 --> 38:18.160]  something wrong
[38:19.440 --> 38:25.040]  but because people might want to break in and take what you've got
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.160]  you don't put a fence in your backyard because your children are bad you do it
[38:30.160 --> 38:33.280]  because there's a highway right there and your five-year-old might climb the
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.600]  fence trying to catch a ball and get run over and killed
[38:37.600 --> 38:41.120]  you don't put seatbelts on because you're a bad person you do it so
[38:41.120 --> 38:47.200]  if somebody hits you you don't die or at least as easily
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.680]  now as joseph gerbil said you have nothing to fear you have nothing to hide
[38:53.680 --> 38:57.760]  yeah right and then they use this criminals use
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.360]  this to control you people put on facebook where they go where they live
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.240]  what they do when they're going out town and they get robbed off that
[39:04.240 --> 39:09.280]  information and all the geo locating i see
[39:09.280 --> 39:11.920]  voicemails on my phone to the crew all the time and i notice they have geo
[39:11.920 --> 39:15.280]  locating on that he'll say whatever address i'm at when i do it unless i
[39:15.280 --> 39:18.480]  block that and it turns out even if i turn that off it's still
[39:18.480 --> 39:23.520]  not blocking it because where you go and what you do and tracking what you do
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.760]  and knowing who you are is valuable they're robbing you
[39:27.760 --> 39:31.840]  they're stealing from you they're learning who you are to sell it
[39:31.840 --> 39:36.880]  and use it against you you know husband and wives a lot of times break up
[39:36.880 --> 39:40.240]  because the husband or the wife is pairing order the
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.120]  other person asking where'd you go today what you do
[39:43.120 --> 39:46.800]  why do you smell like perfume
[39:47.920 --> 39:51.680]  how dare you get into my personal life how dare you try to run my life
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.120]  but there's firing corporations and chai kong run corporations and
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.720]  shillicon valley that hates your guts and are ravenous
[39:58.720 --> 40:03.760]  criminals who are tracking every facet of your life in
[40:03.760 --> 40:07.600]  live time and you better believe recording you when you're jerking off or
[40:07.600 --> 40:10.960]  having sex with your wife and do and tracking everything you do
[40:10.960 --> 40:15.040]  and putting it up in the big ai databases
[40:15.040 --> 40:17.600]  i learned
[40:17.600 --> 40:24.320]  a long time ago before it was ever in the news
[40:24.320 --> 40:28.320]  that they were doing all this and i warned people
[40:28.320 --> 40:33.280]  and then a decade later komi covering up the camera on his laptop
[40:33.280 --> 40:36.640]  zuckerberg people on his way he's covering up his laptop reporters ask
[40:36.640 --> 40:39.200]  why do you cover that oh well hackers can get in and watch me
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.720]  exactly it's a back door for google and facebook and twitter
[40:42.720 --> 40:45.920]  for them but they know other people other criminals
[40:45.920 --> 40:50.000]  can use that back door so they don't leave their back door open
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.680]  but they don't want you to know it's open
[40:53.680 --> 40:57.200]  and so because i'm up here talking about their secrets and what they've done
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.280]  and what horrible predators they are they want to shut me up
[41:01.280 --> 41:05.520]  because just like jonathan gruber said you're a bunch of dumb idiots that
[41:05.520 --> 41:08.880]  don't have a memory or slaves but i don't think you are
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.720]  what does zuckerberg say our users trust us
[41:12.720 --> 41:18.320]  dumb f's he sees you as a sheep to be eaten by a wolf
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.240]  because he's a wolf he doesn't see you as somebody to marry and have kids with
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.400]  or have a future or star bases or explore the universe or black holes or
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.880]  other dimensions he doesn't see you as kindred spirits
[41:28.880 --> 41:34.800]  he sees you as food because he's a psychotic
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.120]  he can't be helped none of them can be reasoned with they're predators they
[41:39.120 --> 41:44.480]  built this giant criminal system that has testicles the size of the planet
[41:44.480 --> 41:48.880]  to do this and it's it's just raping all the
[41:48.880 --> 41:52.560]  data feeding into ai to learn how to manipulate people
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.480]  for global domination for the global government
[41:56.480 --> 41:59.680]  and then i've got to sit here and explain this to people
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.200]  that all the smartphones all technology are designed to ruin your life and
[42:03.200 --> 42:06.560]  control you and make you depressed even facebook and twitter and executives
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.640]  have gone public and said we designed it to pray on you and make you dumb and
[42:10.640 --> 42:12.800]  make you depressed and get deeper into a hole
[42:12.800 --> 42:15.920]  so you go to some lettuce event and they all look like unhealthy
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.480]  scared crazy people because they're the followers that are the weakest
[42:20.480 --> 42:24.880]  that fell to the enemy they're not even the enemy even though i get mad at them
[42:24.880 --> 42:27.920]  when they're screaming we're going to kill you
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.520]  i should feel sorry for them because these are the weakest people
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.920]  that faddle to the control these are the people he must desperately help that
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.040]  are alone and their mental illness all by themselves
[42:39.040 --> 42:43.040]  being fat on by big tech and the psychiatrist that
[42:43.040 --> 42:48.880]  created this giant assault system laura lumbers got a big announcement she's
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.120]  about to make here exclusively straight ahead and then so much more
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.120]  info wars dot com prohuman to the end tomorrow's news
[42:57.120 --> 43:03.680]  today i've been doing a lot of research into google and youtube censorship
[43:03.680 --> 43:07.360]  and i've noticed that there's one type of video
[43:07.360 --> 43:12.240]  that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed
[43:12.240 --> 43:18.640]  and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[43:18.640 --> 43:21.440]  leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others
[43:21.440 --> 43:26.480]  get so butt hurt when trump won they don't want us to have that victory
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.560]  they don't want us to remember what political action did
[43:30.560 --> 43:34.880]  and that's why the globalist hillary and others are trying to shut infowars down
[43:34.880 --> 43:37.920]  this is a fight about taking your speech away
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.440]  not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.920]  this country is in a war so again i want to thank you for what you've done
[43:45.920 --> 43:48.960]  but i want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if
[43:48.960 --> 43:52.080]  you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us
[43:52.080 --> 43:56.240]  in the 360 wind we're dead in the water i'm in your hands you're in my hands
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.040]  infowarstore.com thank you i want to say brain force is great
[44:01.040 --> 44:06.240]  i want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil
[44:06.240 --> 44:10.080]  it's like the fish oil hill is it the fish oil is better than it and that's
[44:10.080 --> 44:15.360]  an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.000]  heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.200]  children's you've got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're going to get
[44:21.200 --> 44:24.240]  the full effect the fish oil and the children's are really strong they don't
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.000]  give you the burpees but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.960]  and i'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free the
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.240]  krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view i'm not a
[44:34.240 --> 44:36.960]  medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five
[44:36.960 --> 44:39.520]  tablets of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing
[44:39.520 --> 44:44.880]  Santa Claus that night so your brain is made
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.840]  basically out of what fish oil is
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.120]  so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just obsessed because
[44:53.120 --> 44:59.280]  whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it
[44:59.280 --> 45:02.800]  info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine
[45:02.800 --> 45:06.800]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[45:06.800 --> 45:09.920]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[45:09.920 --> 45:13.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[45:13.680 --> 45:18.160]  eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.000]  researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.840]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.760]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.040]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[45:33.040 --> 45:36.880]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[45:36.880 --> 45:41.200]  pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine

[48:13.840 --> 48:18.640]  is laura lumar who for women out there i'm the most banned man in the world
[48:18.640 --> 48:21.760]  she is the most banned woman banned off everything now basically

[48:25.280 --> 48:29.360]  you her site with all the audio all the video you go there that's how you do it
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.360]  and realize that uh again just a month or so ago she went out to the
[48:33.360 --> 48:37.440]  ansi plosie's house she had she actually picked up nice
[48:37.440 --> 48:40.560]  illegal aliens she said they're nice people on average took them there in a
[48:40.560 --> 48:43.280]  bus to say that she wanted them to go and live on her property at her
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.280]  vineyard they arrested all of them so she faces court where you to that
[48:47.280 --> 48:50.800]  but she's got a big announcement as she strikes back that i'm fully behind but
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.720]  look at these headlines obama's dhs head border problem
[48:54.720 --> 48:57.920]  is a crisis by any measure that was two weeks ago
[48:57.920 --> 49:01.200]  hostile and aggressive migrants break through border into southern mexico
[49:01.200 --> 49:04.800]  joined us found caravan the videos up on info wars dot com has happened
[49:04.800 --> 49:09.280]  yesterday biggest caravan yet uh i mean this is just crazy
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.560]  cori booker admits releasing migrants in sanctuary cities would
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.560]  make us less safe because they mainly the democrats bust them to democrat
[49:16.560 --> 49:20.720]  strongholds in red areas and they make conservatives pay for it
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.240]  that's menisota used to be conservative other menabrasca
[49:24.240 --> 49:27.760]  other areas isn't they're doing it to texas is how they're turning this blue
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.640]  uh house democrats blame trump for worsening border crisis and bill mar
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.640]  had guessed on now saying okay there is a crisis but it's trump's fault
[49:36.640 --> 49:39.840]  laura lumar thanks for joining us this is just getting incredible they think
[49:39.840 --> 49:45.200]  we don't have a memory thanks for having me alex yeah it's incredible but uh i
[49:45.200 --> 49:48.640]  think it's even more incredible just to see the medias war on the american
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.160]  people because they're acting as if this is something new
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.840]  president trump and his administration announced that they're thinking of
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.320]  releasing illegal aliens into sanctuary cities because the democrats have said
[50:00.320 --> 50:04.960]  everybody is welcome here well as you know back in january so
[50:04.960 --> 50:10.720]  literally to the date three months ago i drove to california i drove to mexico
[50:10.720 --> 50:14.240]  i picked up some illegal aliens from the home depot and i put them on nancy
[50:14.240 --> 50:18.240]  polosi's lawn at her multi-million dollar mansion and you know because we
[50:18.240 --> 50:21.440]  gave you the exclusive feed and live streamed it and millions of people saw
[50:21.440 --> 50:25.120]  it and it was the number one trending story on twitter even though
[50:25.120 --> 50:28.960]  both you and myself are both banned from twitter and what i find to be really
[50:28.960 --> 50:33.840]  interesting about this is how they're acting as if uh this is new
[50:33.840 --> 50:38.000]  information and what i find to be very interesting is how
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.320]  there's total denial on behalf of the mainstream media whether it be fox news
[50:42.320 --> 50:46.240]  cnn and even other uh conservatives who claim to be on our
[50:46.240 --> 50:49.600]  site to recognize that this that this has already been done
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.040]  we already know what would happen if you put illegal aliens in the sanctuary
[50:53.040 --> 50:56.640]  cities or on the property of people like nancy polosi and gabin nusum
[50:56.640 --> 51:00.320]  you know ben bergweim and i we put illegals on nancy's lawn and then two
[51:00.320 --> 51:04.560]  weeks later we went to her nephew's home gabin nusum the governor of california
[51:04.560 --> 51:08.080]  and we set up a sanctuary state fair on his lawn at the california governor's
[51:08.080 --> 51:13.120]  mansion and uh we were arrested uh we weren't arrested at nancy polosi's
[51:13.120 --> 51:16.320]  place and i wanted to prove to the american people that the governor
[51:16.320 --> 51:19.760]  declare you got arrested at the governor's mansion so so illegal aliens
[51:19.760 --> 51:23.120]  can literally camp out your backyard if they want but if you do it to the actual
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.160]  democrats calling them in so so how big a victory is it though that they have to
[51:26.160 --> 51:29.040]  now admit it is a crisis and don't bring them to our
[51:29.040 --> 51:33.200]  sanctuary cities that is huge well i think it's perfect and the timing
[51:33.200 --> 51:37.200]  couldn't be better because as you know last week i was in california for court
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.440]  and i had to go to court in sacramento because gabin nusum press charges against
[51:41.440 --> 51:45.360]  me for trespassing can you believe it so it's not trespassing for illegal
[51:45.360 --> 51:48.640]  aliens to come across our border illegally but it's trespassing if
[51:48.640 --> 51:52.080]  laura loomer and ben bergweim put on a poncho and a sombrero
[51:52.080 --> 51:56.320]  and start dancing around and you know like bring some poop needles as
[51:56.320 --> 51:59.120]  that's what we did we put poop and needles on the governor's
[51:59.120 --> 52:04.320]  uh lawn that's right if you throw rocks and feces at border patrol and physically
[52:04.320 --> 52:07.760]  attack them you get let go into the us but if you just go make a joke in
[52:07.760 --> 52:11.840]  sombreros the governor's mansion in the yard you go to jail
[52:11.840 --> 52:15.680]  yeah and so luckily the charges are going to be dismissed i actually have to go
[52:15.680 --> 52:20.320]  back to california they're making me go uh on mother's day weekend to take a
[52:20.320 --> 52:23.920]  life skills course for six hours so i guess i have to learn how to be a
[52:23.920 --> 52:28.640]  better human being for six hours in california uh so that should be really
[52:28.640 --> 52:32.560]  interesting but can you believe the da the da told uh the
[52:32.560 --> 52:36.480]  attorney that gabin nusum was trying to push for me and ben to be put in jail
[52:36.480 --> 52:41.040]  for 15 days and to get three years of probation and a
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.680]  um permanent trespass notice and restraining order from the governor's
[52:45.680 --> 52:49.680]  mansion so that we could never return but uh you never see anything like that
[52:49.680 --> 52:53.920]  happening to illegal aliens so yeah there's no restraining orders for people
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.800]  that have been deported five six seven times and rape women
[52:56.800 --> 53:00.400]  rob banks they just let them back in and if you one of them shoots a woman in
[53:00.400 --> 53:03.520]  the back in san francisco the liberal jury says let them go
[53:03.520 --> 53:08.240]  killing a white woman's a good thing right yeah that's what's happening and uh
[53:08.240 --> 53:12.240]  it's it's a crisis and i i find it to be hilarious because
[53:12.240 --> 53:16.240]  uh now i know for a fact that donald trump and his administration are
[53:16.240 --> 53:21.680]  watching loomert videos tell us about that
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.120]  well it's pretty evident this was my idea pointing them and stuff yeah it's
[53:25.120 --> 53:28.000]  exciting it's it's very exciting i mean i hope
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.080]  that they will actually tweet the video as opposed to just uh mentioning the
[53:32.080 --> 53:35.200]  idea but uh this was my idea that i came up with and i
[53:35.200 --> 53:41.040]  implemented uh on my own of course um at casa de nancy and casa de gavin and it
[53:41.040 --> 53:44.240]  goes to show you that that's why we are being banned
[53:44.240 --> 53:47.280]  that's why they're trying to silence me and you know we're effective and we're
[53:47.280 --> 53:53.040]  taking action and yeah yeah we're we're very effective
[53:53.040 --> 53:56.960]  and i've been thinking about it a lot and you know this last week the
[53:56.960 --> 54:00.960]  democrats launched in a whole blown assault against me to get me banned on
[54:00.960 --> 54:05.280]  facebook and instagram because i spoke truth about ilhan omar and i spoke
[54:05.280 --> 54:08.000]  truth about yeah that's a big national story get laura
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.160]  loomer and alex jones off instagram they go
[54:10.160 --> 54:13.440]  they're not allowed to have any place we want to have them off air so we can lie
[54:13.440 --> 54:17.040]  about there's been a big push to get you and i off instagram for actually two
[54:17.040 --> 54:20.000]  weeks yeah and and so media matters has been
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.400]  really pushing to uh to ban me and you falsely accusing us of being white
[54:24.400 --> 54:28.480]  nationalist and it's if they ever went to a white
[54:28.480 --> 54:31.520]  nationalist website we're like public enemy number one
[54:31.520 --> 54:34.240]  notice the white national has never talked about about the left though
[54:34.240 --> 54:37.520]  no no no it's all just us that's actually defending the country
[54:37.520 --> 54:40.720]  because there are a bunch of leftist funded criminals i'm telling the
[54:40.720 --> 54:43.920]  southern private law center runs those sites
[54:43.920 --> 54:48.320]  yeah well i've been thinking a lot to myself and i know that their goal is to
[54:48.320 --> 54:52.720]  eradicate me so that i'm completely gone so that someday when people type in
[54:52.720 --> 54:55.840]  more loomer nothing shows up and it says no results found
[54:55.840 --> 54:59.360]  for us since they banned you you've only gotten more powerful in my view
[54:59.360 --> 55:03.280]  you've only gotten more aggressive yeah well they're not going to stop me
[55:03.280 --> 55:06.960]  and because they're launching such a vicious attack against me they've
[55:06.960 --> 55:11.120]  actually triggered me to go another step further
[55:11.120 --> 55:15.360]  and as you know in this country the fbc has uh has ruled
[55:15.360 --> 55:18.960]  that it is against the law for social media companies
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.520]  to ban uh people who run for office so here's the big announcement drum roll
[55:23.520 --> 55:27.760]  please go ahead
[55:27.760 --> 55:33.520]  so i uh i'm announcing this on your show exclusively today but uh i have been
[55:33.520 --> 55:38.320]  seriously exploring a congressional run in 2020

[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.280]  when when when trump is more pro-israel than probably even you or i
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.200]  which is fine it makes sense well nobody's against that and so i'm proud
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.040]  i'm not getting a paycheck from israel i'm proud to say that israel should exist
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.880]  and have its own country uh and that's a whole other subject it's just that
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.440]  i've thought about running as a democrat uh against trump just as obviously
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.280]  you know a way to get the news out to say he should fight censorship more and
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.480]  point out what socialists they are and the democrats used to be for working

[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.320]  of me lumering ilhan omar and rishita to leave so avya is a close friend of mine
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.760]  it's really terrible what happened to him i mean it's really despicable that in
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:51.440]  america people who expose islam for what it is and people who uh exposed the left
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.880]  are now being detained by the fbi and i'm gonna hold you over i'm gonna hold
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.280]  you over because you can talk to him since you guys are friends we'll do that
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.080]  then we'll get into this whole story but think about this
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.600]  you're exposing people that hate america say they hate america
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.920]  they want to turn us into islamic state your band for exposing ilhan omar
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.760]  and then this guy comes in to expose comedy central saying he's a nazi
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.640]  with edited tapes and he's banned yeah well look this is what i've been saying
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.280]  for uh almost two and a half years every time i come on your show alex is
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:25.760]  this is a form of islamic blasphemy law this is sharia law
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.360]  and people think that it's a conspiracy theory to say that sharia law is coming
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.720]  to america well i've got news for you sharia law isn't america
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.920]  in minnesota the democrats are proposing legislation
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.000]  to push islamic blasphemy laws to make it a crime to criticize islam
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.680]  the democrats all across this country people like alexandra casio-cortez
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.920]  rishita to leave in ilhan are trying to hold committees in congress to
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.840]  uh demonize people who talk about 9 11 they don't think we should be able to
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.440]  show pictures of 9 11 anymore because it offends
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.480]  muslims well i'm sorry but what offends me
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.480]  is 19 muslims hijacking planes and killing 3 000 americans i find that
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.240]  pretty offensive or attacking christians jews and
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.280]  anybody else that isn't in their religion islamic countries don't let
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:12.800]  other people in and it's it's it's just incredible and you know

[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.600]  ladies and gentlemen so much is happening that we have a
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.680]  australian conservative activist who was banned from the u.s at the
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.680]  comedy central edited video of him who said that this jewish man was a white
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.720]  supremacist avi yemeny will be joining us
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:00.000]  laura lumar uh totally banned the most banned woman in the world on the
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.400]  internet uh i'm the most banned man she's the most
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.040]  banned woman uh banned from the internet for simply
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.600]  saying that uh all these radical muslim women that george soros is
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.640]  funding say cut women's genitals off when they're
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.800]  born kill gays uh they defend it uh linda
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.240]  sorcerer all of them are out there basically preaching
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:25.760]  hardcore syria law and if you criticize it you get taken off the
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.920]  internet but but i want to shift gears into another subject right now
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.120]  we talked about the sum but i want to put this in a moment what do you make of
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.240]  the democrats denying that there's giant caravan slamming in
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.920]  when a new one just blasted through violently
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.080]  through mexican riot police yesterday hundreds of thousands are now marching
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.920]  towards the border hundred thousand a month uh it caught hundreds of thousands
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.160]  get in if you're a tv viewer on a radio listener this is new footage radio
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.560]  listeners go to info wars dot com four slash show uh and see it all
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.440]  what do you make of the democrats on bill marr all of it shifting
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.400]  from saying there is no caravan as jake tapper said as
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:12.560]  um others uh said and then now okay there is a caravan but they say
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.360]  trump is to blame for the caravan it's like again like johnson ribber said
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.440]  they think we have no memory they're betting on that
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.640]  all to the democrats homes and the democrats offices then
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.280]  i think it's a brilliant idea obviously because i
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.880]  think it's a brilliant idea
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.720]  all right laura we we've lost your audio we've been had big technical problems
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.600]  today i'm not sure even what's going on around here anymore
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:45.360]  uh can we try to go back to her just a moment laura go ahead
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.480]  okay all right let me just do this while they do whatever they do with the
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.360]  computers in there um i'm gonna have to get some new equipment or
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.640]  something it's it's it's reached crisis proportions around here
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:59.120]  but before we do that uh here today let me go ahead and play this clip
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.920]  whoo may i tell you unbelievable let me go ahead and play this clip of
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.280]  kori booker admits releasing migrants in the sanctuary cities
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.720]  would make us less safe this is really critical information because
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.400]  they're saying there aren't migrants there aren't caravans this doesn't exist
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.680]  but but but now have trump threatens to release them because the judge is making
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.560]  do it and there's no more beds left well now they're
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.600]  saying that that this blames us here it is
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.240]  do you think this is an empty threat by the president though to talk about
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.120]  busing people from the border into these sanctuary
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.480]  cities he likes to create friction sometimes to jump start he says a
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.360]  congress that's not acting you say friction i say he's trying to pit
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.640]  americans against each other and make us less safe because what you're seeing
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.320]  now so you take the threat seriously i i i take this he is injecting fear
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.680]  into our country and so if he was looking to solve a problem he wouldn't be
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.480]  doing things to divide this country against itself
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.640]  i'd be be aware of any anybody that's trying to tell you to be afraid
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.360]  in the strongest country in the world as opposed to showing our strength and our
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.720]  courage by pulling people together to find common sense
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.320]  solutions to solve this problem
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.200]  the paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.120]  its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.120]  the first amendment states that congress shall make no law
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.200]  abridging the freedom of speech or of the press
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:32.080]  which one of these two ideas represents where we are now as a culture
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.200]  frankfort school adherent former member of the brain trust of the os s american
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.840]  war machine and godfather of the new left
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.640]  herbert marcusi along with his contemporaries engineered a slow moving
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.920]  marxist revolution from within american society utilizing a mass psychoanalytic
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.760]  hegelian dialectic psiop that is blossoming today
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.280]  amongst the lethargic minds of the millennial generation
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.440]  a synthesizing technique known as repressive tolerance
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.280]  thankfully in the interest of time marcusi simplified the definition of
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.800]  repressive tolerance saying repressive tolerance is
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.320]  intolerance against movements from the right and toleration of movements from
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:18.000]  the left repressive tolerance is achieved by arming the
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.440]  thoughts of emotional rationally vacant liberals
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:26.560]  with the potent weapon of critical theory a hive mentality that produces a
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.400]  catharsis for the self-loathing types of our society
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.560]  when confronting the social historical and ideological forces
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.960]  gluing the structures of a society together because congressional hearings
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.720]  are determining that american patriots are to be labeled white
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.000]  nationalist and now we see witnesses invited by the
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.440]  minority who openly associate with purveyors of hate
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.280]  white nationalism and its proliferation online have real consequences
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.120]  americans have died because of it what about the man who's also really
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.880]  leading this for the white house steven miller he is spearheading the immigration
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.960]  agenda and congresswoman ilhan omar actually referred to him
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.120]  as a white nationalist do you agree with her
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.320]  i believe that what we have seen from steven miller is
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.880]  vestiges of white nationalism and now a cbs show known as the good fight
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.880]  is leading a propagandized rehash of modern-day bolshevism
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.840]  by legitimizing violence against anyone label the white nationalist by
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.200]  relabeling the paradox of tolerance as the overton window
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:34.720]  is it all right to hit a nazi unprovoked
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.840]  i was always taught to never throw the first punch never instigate
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:42.800]  the fan don't attack but then i saw a video of the white nationalist richard
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.200]  spencer being punched in the face during an interview and i realized
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.240]  spencer was in a press suit wearing a tie big interview like his opinion mattered
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.880]  like he should be considered part of the conversation like
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.480]  neo-nazism was just one political point of view and then
[01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.520]  i realized there's no better way to show some speech is not equal
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:08.000]  some speech requires a more visceral response it's like overton's window
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.200]  that's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.440]  well overton's window doesn't mean unless it comes with some enforcement so
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.920]  yeah this is enforcement it's time to punch a few
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.760]  nazis this is a very dangerous precedent and
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.240]  should be dealt with immediately as we tumble headlong into the fray of an
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:32.080]  impending presidential election which the left will not accept
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.520]  along with a record number of democratic presidential candidates
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.880]  that agree with this gobel's level madness
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.880]  who are we your african-american that's your brand
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.600]  diversity is in right now we should be looking here in the future
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.400]  a future where trump wins in 2020 televised mental illness
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.320]  that legitimizes attacking innocent free-thinking americans
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:00.000]  is now acceptable do you want a mission do i want
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.160]  a mission i'm looking for people who are ready to take the fight to dream
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.800]  they expect us all to accept their savvy tongue-in-cheek arrogant hypocrisy
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:16.160]  as relevant and cute to their demographic of anti-american far left extremists
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.000]  and antifa morons i'm ready to fight the resistance
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.440]  starts now do your worst oh don't hit me
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.600]  but they are literally calling for violence so yeah
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.080]  this is enforcement i am reporting this trailer to twitter as a violation of
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.320]  their terms of service that state you may not make specific threats of
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.120]  violence or a wish for the serious physical harm
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.880]  death or disease of an individual or group of people
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.720]  john bound reporting if you are receiving this transmission

[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.360]  the stuff that's going on is just amazing and you see how the general public
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.640]  from all the tv watching everything else is like in a malaise
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.920]  they're like in a haze and they don't even know what's going on
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.960]  and then there's people that are awake and then people
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.480]  that that that that are awake but are praying
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:30.640]  on the general public it's amazing so we'll see when you get the connection
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.000]  up we've been having some problems with avi yemeny
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.600]  from australia he just got kicked out of the u.s only here a few hours
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.920]  fb i grabbed him he has no criminal record but you see comedy central did
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.960]  want him to come here because they got caught editing video
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.720]  to say he was a white supremacist he needs to sue them this is what they do
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.040]  though all the mainstream media are a bunch of jesse
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.680]  schmollett that's why jesse schmollett didn't get in trouble
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.800]  because he did his job
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.920]  our grandparents and great grandparents know they can't food

[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:27.920]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.000]  so comedy central is on all over the world
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.080]  it reaches over two billion people so it's still big media
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.440]  i mean you notice mainstream news has almost no viewers now the average
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.360]  CNN shows like a hundred thousand viewers they're a joke but
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.200]  if it's the so-called comics on comedy central or the late night comedy
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.960]  shows like steven colbert they still have five six seven eight nine million
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.280]  viewers and so what they do is they pose as
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.960]  comics who are posing as newsmen but really what they are
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.600]  is incredible deceivers i mean colbert gets up and says that i'm in the kkk
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.520]  i call law firms they go well it's comedy but people
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.960]  believe it man he he poses as alex jones and rubs manaze all over his face
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:17.840]  and says alex jones you know is a nazi people then scream nazi on the street
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.920]  so our next guest here i'm gonna play a clip of this
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.520]  and then go to him for the rest of the hour lord limmer she has time will pop back in with us
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.560]  their friends abhi yemeny of course lives in australia he's a patriot uh you just
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.680]  you know supports basic freedom jim jeffreese is a huge star on comedy
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.840]  central a year ago or almost interviews him
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.880]  and then they hold on to it until the tragic events in new zealand happened
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.320]  and they play clips in our interview that aren't even connected to make it look
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.680]  like he's attacking muslims and he supports the attack
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.520]  think about this and the danger it puts him in so he
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.360]  would secretly recorded it because he was advised to comes out later
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.680]  he goes viral 10 million views or so well well here he is talking about it and
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.640]  then we'll respond to what happened we tried to fly into the u.s for a
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.240]  mediator the fbi was there and basically arrested
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.240]  him and kicked him out because comedy central said so here it is
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.040]  i might sound like a hippie saying this what gives anyone the right to tell
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:23.440]  anyone where they can and can't live when you import this culture what do you
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.840]  think is going to happen australia is going to end up the same
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.080]  they came from that they were escaping watch how
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:35.920]  jim jeffreese has edited this last clip to make me look like an ass
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.520]  see what i really said what gives anyone the right to tell anyone where they
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.920]  can and can't live really they can't borders though i know
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:49.360]  borders but wouldn't it just be nice if
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.960]  if we got to a place in society where we had hope here
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.240]  well at least a utopia where we all just committed
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:02.640]  i i on on on a level like we may say i'm a dreamer i think i think most
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.800]  most people most you know sensible people would agree with your theory
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.520]  yeah but in practice it's not it goes against human nature it just doesn't
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:17.520]  work you bloody scumbag jim you see those rubbish
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.960]  edits through the entire segment i don't even need to show you you get my
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.280]  point they put one answer to a different question
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.440]  but today what i really want to show you is how
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:36.000]  jim jeffreese speaks about islam about their prophet muhammad
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.680]  and about muslims themselves when he thinks the cameras aren't rolling
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.840]  or when he knows he can cut it out so muhammad is considered the perfect
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.320]  connect right okay he can't draw a picture
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:52.080]  no don't you dare don't you dare i've got enough death threats on me brother
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.240]  jesus there he is he looks like a wobbly ghost
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.760]  he's finally gonna understand this one
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:06.560]  that's what you do jimmy when you think no one's going to see it
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.360]  okay so we will just for the rest of the hour laura lumbers decided to stay we

[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:38.720]  to get into the u.s and of course you've laid out even the other big lies in an
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.840]  hour-long video that he engaged in they're really scared of this but
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.320]  their fascist response and the fbi even with trump being president
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:51.120]  being the lapdog of comedy central to keep you out of the u.s is a danger
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.160]  is quite frankly frightening thanks for joining us thanks for having me matt
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.520]  yeah it's scary scary times to think that um
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.600]  a comedy channel wields that sort of power
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.280]  well lay out for folks we got a longer segment coming up laura's gonna join us
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.040]  what happened and and i mean just to boil down and then and then what happened
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.920]  when you tried to come to the u.s to set the record straight this guy's saying
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.280]  you're a nazi that wants to kill muslims by editing tapes
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.480]  uh you you should sue him instead you just tried to do a mediator and they
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.400]  won't let you do that yeah so so basically jim
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.640]  he's produced seven months ago contacted me asked me if i'll be part of the
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.920]  second show that they're doing the upcoming uh
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.400]  jim jeffrey special i laid out two basic conditions that i'll take part in
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:43.920]  this show i said no neo-nazis and don't cut my answers
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:48.480]  you know i i'm pretty confident in in where i stand on issues
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.880]  um if you don't like what i say just post it as a whole
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.800]  now they agree to those terms um but you know when i'd seen what actually came
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.520]  out following the christ church massacre where they tried to put
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.000]  essentially blame me for what happened there in christ church
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.920]  um and they did the other two exact things they started this segment with
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.400]  no neo-nazis here in australia they then they put me on and they cut up as you
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.880]  saw in the clip before my answers from one question to another
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.760]  in fact they also they went further they also took even facial expressions i
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.160]  made to you know weird things he was saying and cut it up to
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.000]  something kind of sensible that he was saying or a sensible question he was
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.800]  asking so it was an absolute hack job i'm just
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.080]  thankful that i had the foresight and it was actually uh
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.080]  tommy robinson who when i told him i was invited said mate just
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:47.760]  film that thing whole and i'm grateful i did so
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.840]  because you know you saw it at the end if i if i didn't have that footage
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.880]  i wouldn't be in the position i'm in now i would my name would be ruined forever
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:02.640]  but uh yeah my response was to do this american tour against fake news uh
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.280]  would been invited onto a number of shows and uh and i was going to go to
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.040]  comedy central in new york and not not to be violent not to
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.800]  anything my and this is what i told the fbi when they asked me if i was
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.200]  planning on obtaining weapons i said mate my
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.840]  my most powerful weapons are right here in my bag my microphone and camera
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.280]  i don't need anything else they know you're you're you're you're in australian
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.320]  but you went and joined the defense forces you have no criminal record you're
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.520]  very clear you're coming to expose this and so comedy central
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.360]  follows a fake report that you're a terrorist coming to kill them
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.920]  and then you're thrown out of the u.s this is just outrageous
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.920]  look to be fair my issue is not even with the fbi it's not with the border
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.760]  protection they were actually really no no i know but it's scary that the left
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.000]  makes up stuff and they're like dogs do whatever they're told
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.160]  look essentially what's what practically happened at the end
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.800]  is comedy central managed to get me thrown out of the u.s at least for
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.200]  now um based on their original false complaint
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:11.440]  um that the fbi cleared me there was no problem at the end and it when it was
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.480]  passed back to border protection then that triggered an investigation which
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:21.280]  looked at my original application and this this same visa that i was in the
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.880]  states only six months ago with laura luma or seven
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.320]  months ago with laura luma and and and there was no issue with that same
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.720]  application but because two years ago when i filled in that form
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.520]  it turned out that you know they asked me a whole series of questions and
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.440]  generally most of them are pretty crazy now are you a terrorist are you
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.040]  associated to neo nazis do you you know all these kind of questions where you
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.280]  just kind of go no no no no no one of the questions happened to be
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.680]  um have you ever been denied a visa to the us hold on stay right there avy
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.960]  yemeny we'll be right back stay with us there are thousands of ideologies out
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.800]  there hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.560]  the globalist info wars is truly the tip of the
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.680]  sphere of the zeitgeist that's what a globalist are obsessed with it
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.520]  trying to shut it down i didn't invent all this i went and researched the
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.200]  renaissance americana and what really works for humanity
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.040]  and i'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:24.400]  like it's always been that's why the globalists are trying to
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.000]  shut it down so desperately because we have the light

[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:06.720]  remember when tv didn't watch you you watch television there's no reviews yet
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.160]  for but it's at info warshore.com we bought the best-selling antenna
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.160]  we sell it for what is it five dollars less than amazon does info wars hd
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.800]  digital tv antenna and i mean look you're talking like a hundred plus digital
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.360]  channels and then they'll have four or five sub channels of every old cool tv
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.080]  show old movies it's like way better than cable
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.440]  and it's like hawaii 50 gilligan's island i dream a genie
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.160]  dalas stuff from the 90s new stuff like when the olympics was on i didn't know
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.000]  there were 10 channels of olympics on tv i mean it's like my god this is way
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.600]  better than cable and people don't know that it's free
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.280]  after you buy the antenna the point is is that there's so many
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:49.520]  channels and it's not watching you it's not tracking you so we do sell the
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:59.360]  antennas at the lowest price you'll find info warshore.com
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:03.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.360]  you
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:23.200]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:31.360]  you're listening to alex jones so it's 5 33 p.m where i sit here in texas it's
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.760]  8 3 in the morning over in uh sydney australia
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.840]  and obi yemen he joined us and and the two seconds we have left i want to have
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.440]  him and lord lima really take the floor and not have me ask questions because
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.200]  if you study history and you study tyranny first they restrict your speech
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.560]  then they restrict your bank accounts then they restrict your movements then
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.880]  they put you in jail then they put you in forced labor then they kill you
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:01.200]  from the romans to the babilonians to the ancient chinese to the aztecs i mean
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.720]  this is the way it goes and when they can say laura loomer and this isn't a
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.200]  joke anybody hasn't looked us up is a white supremacist
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:18.160]  when she's jewish or they can do this kind of stuff it's very dangerous
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:21.440]  and you've got obi yemen he was like i'm i call him a mainline nationalist
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.480]  conservative happens to be jewish happened to serve the israeli defense
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.280]  forces he's an australian that went and did that
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:30.640]  he gets they take this months and months ago they put it in the can they
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.320]  wait till the event happens and they say he supports it by editing it
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.880]  and then he's the victim and then he tries to go cover it
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:42.160]  and they ban him i think this will backfire and laura loomer you jump at
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.560]  any time you've worked with obi yemeny and exposed ilhan omar and
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.800]  all these other islamists are putting in and it's just they're treating you like
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.040]  the enemy but what i thought of during the break was we can pull this up
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:59.920]  more than 20 000 jihadis brought into sweden and germany alone
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:03.520]  more than 5 000 just the last two years out of syria into england
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.640]  who were isis who were al qaeda that killed people
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:10.160]  they're brought in and given welfare they're brought in and and quote
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.160]  resettled and treated like they had ptsd but then people with no criminal
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:17.760]  records u.s citizens like laura loomer born in this country
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:23.520]  she's banned on the internet obi yemeny at tr dot news a patriot no criminal
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.120]  record serving israeli military but born off he lives in australia
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.560]  he's banned from the u.s he's lied about there i mean this is criminal
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.920]  so see you guys go ahead just break down what happened to you uh and jump
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.880]  anytime laura loomer but obi uh what happened once you got her because you
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.840]  broke this down right when you got in your car at the airport once you landed
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.880]  how the media lied about you how they acted like you were a criminal i mean
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.440]  this is so dangerous that they're now trying to control our movement
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.040]  absolutely the the narrative and that's why it was so important for me to
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.000]  straight away clarify what was going on because even the media here in australia
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.600]  straight away uh created this false narrative this false
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.800]  story about what was happening and the fact was
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:04.960]  the only reason why i was detained um was because i was there to expose
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.040]  comedy central for what they did for publishing an absolutely proven fake
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.080]  news story in fact after i uh published the real
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.960]  version of what happened literally the hidden camera
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.440]  um my page is pulled from facebook again and that video was pulled off facebook
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.600]  and the original offending uh def defamatory video of comedy central is
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.640]  still up there there is a double standard here
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.200]  well that's right just in laura jumping anytime because you guys have worked
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.000]  together for years but described when you get off an lax
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.600]  you did like a ten minute video but just briefly fbi's waiting you start you
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.680]  can't believe this is happening it was surreal it was like a movie and uh you
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.640]  know i did i work with laura hey laura i work with laura when i was there last
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.480]  time in the in the states and in fact she was ahead of the time when it came
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.600]  to uh the the two at the time they were
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  candidates um but this was surreal i come in our land
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:05.920]  i come on the exact same visa that i arrived there previously
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:09.520]  i'm pulled to a back room and there's fbi agents
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.840]  like in a movie for me that was just like what is going on and i i couldn't
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.520]  help myself but as soon as i seen the two fbi agents
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:21.680]  and they flashed their badges i i actually just cracked up laughing and i
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.640]  pointed and i got and i said to them comedy central
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.160]  and their response was so telling that they said to me
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:34.080]  uh we are actually a different a separate entity to comedy central
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:38.400]  like they had to clarify that they were a separate entity and they said to me
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.720]  and i said yes but the informant is is comedy central right and they said
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:46.080]  well we've received a number of complaints that we need to
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.520]  clarify from comedy central and the complaints were
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.800]  absurd they in fact they used a photo of me from
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.960]  my service in the israeli army as proof that i'm some sort of
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:02.720]  well-trained killer who's out to target to track down and target
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.640]  jim jeffreys what did they say that i want lord to jump in when they threw you

[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:18.160]  come on in here and then what do they say when they finally said we're shipping
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.080]  you back oh look they were all very uh nice
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.760]  about everything and at the end they they claim it is a technicality and and
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.720]  time will tell while i'm today applying for the the the renewed visa let's
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.600]  see if what they say is actually true and it is not

[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.600]  um but they got treated like an absolute criminal i was

[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.160]  hours in detention i was in a room of illegal

[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.360]  trumps on the tv and they're all blaming donald trump they obviously didn't
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:01.360]  know who i was and they're i'm a big supporter um but they escorted me to
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.120]  the plane and i gave my passport to the flight attendant
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.440]  with instructions that i was not to receive it back kill our land

[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.920]  incredible laura lumber you know this guy well he's done a lot of work trying
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.880]  to expose the islamists before they got their foothold now
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:26.000]  literally saying america sucks get rid of it blow up israel
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.880]  i mean now this is going on you guys expose ill han and the others have
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.920]  been elected you know this guy how scary is this
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.040]  i mean it's ridiculous and i was uh you know like one of the first people to
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.160]  really mess a job in when this whole thing went down and you know abhi's a
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:42.000]  great guy he's a patriot but you have to look at the insanity of this right
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.920]  abhi yemeni getting deported from the united states mylo yiannopoulos being
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.440]  denied a visa into australia but then when you look at these islamic
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:52.880]  hate preachers who are calling for the killing of jews and christians and
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.240]  calling for the killing of homosexuals they are invited on speaking tours
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.680]  sponsored by mosques all around the world to go to australia
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.680]  and all across america you know this happened to me when i was exposing a
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.840]  jihadi in orlando last year alex and i i was interviewed on your
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.920]  show about it and i showed up because they had this syrian
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:15.440]  imam who was giving a talk in orlando
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.040]  uh school for muslim parents and this guy had
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.960]  issued plot was against jews and called for the killing of homosexuals
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:28.480]  and i showed up to protest this and to report it as a journalist and to record
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:32.480]  what he was saying inside and the police here in the united states of america
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:37.360]  threatened to arrest me because i showed up to report on a jihadist who
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.680]  was called for the killing of americans and as
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.640]  issued plot to us encouraging muslims to blow up buses full of jews and israel
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.160]  i mean it's insane what is happening in this country and now it's coming out
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:52.160]  that omar like oh they did something on 9 11 she's been another tape saying you
[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:55.600]  know we're not terrorists we're fighting back it's just like if america
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.760]  sucks so bad why are you trying to come here where do you think this goes next
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:04.560]  av because i mean it's just getting so clear to everybody how insane this is
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.320]  it is and and laura is a hundred percent spot on because at the end of day when
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.760]  when milo was banned uh not too long ago at exactly the same time as he was
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:19.280]  being banned there was a radical islamic preacher touring the entire
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:23.280]  country um so we're heading in the wrong direction
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:29.120]  absolutely and i think this pc this pc madness where
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:35.120]  only you know patriots or only people who actually love their westerns you know
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:39.520]  civilized democratic way of life are the ones being penalized
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.760]  and not the real enemy not let me ask you this when you come back you'll get into
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:46.800]  what are you going to do next but why are they targeting you and laura
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.440]  particularly because they're really censoring both of you me too
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:53.440]  what is it that they're so scared of uh in both of you but go ahead laura will
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.880]  come back with the av on the side because we're jewish conservatives and
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.240]  while there's a full blown assault on all conservatives there's especially an
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.240]  attack on jewish conservatives because we are resisting the globalist left
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.800]  wing jewish movement which you see is being uh pushed forward by the adl
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.240]  uh the adl is conspiring with these left wing
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.560]  social media companies to censor us and you're not the right type of jew
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.760]  and so so let's use don't want people to know that most
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.440]  us are conservative or common sense they want to speak for you stand to
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.800]  silence you because jews are really upset right now and see through this
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.120]  yeah it's like a digital show is what it is and you know they
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.960]  essentially through their actions are walking us to the gas oh i agree
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.520]  the adl people are like pro-islamic takeover
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.680]  i have an interfaith dialogue with these islamic individuals like ilhan oman
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.440]  rashida to leave who at the end of the day if they could push if they if those
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.480]  two women could push a button and eradicate every single jew from the
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.160]  planet they would oh you know they would i mean i mean you know they would and
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:56.800]  and that that's what this is we'll be right back

[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.840]  free country stuff i saw him like a year ago i was like okay nice guy
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.800]  and then he gets set up which i've been through
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:54.080]  well they just go alex jones white supremacist you're like oh you're walking

[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.880]  comedy central sets you up the edited tapes of you you caught them
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.960]  and now the response is ban you from the u.s claiming that you wanted to create
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.400]  violence against this so-called talk show house
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.600]  it just shows how desperate they are to cover up what they've done i mean don't
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.000]  they know that people are now recording them during these interviews
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.960]  well they're they're desperate and they're arrogant they're arrogant on every
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.360]  level at every stage you look at the fact that when i walk in there and i'd
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.240]  put down and and and i literally set up two
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.960]  phones on a couch and propped them up by pillows
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.280]  not one person notice it with 15 people in that room that's how self-absorbed
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.480]  they are that's how above um the rules they believe that they are
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.840]  and following that they still haven't made a statement they just
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.600]  ban and block anybody who on twitter challenges them and i encourage all your
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.200]  viewers to go and and you know tag
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.120]  jim jeffrey's comedy central you will see that every few people that do what
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.040]  they get banned and on my on my twitter you can see i've people have just been
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.480]  sharing and i've been retweeting hundreds upon hundreds of people that
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:27.920]  have been blocked from jim jeffrey's but literally asked him
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.440]  to acknowledge what he's done and what they've done
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.040]  now they're arrogance now that they're they're trying to literally
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.240]  physically shut down anybody who challenges them by getting them deported
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:44.720]  this is i mean i gotta stop you but but as you said you're a very polite nice
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.560]  guy watched the whole hour-long interview that you did
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:52.560]  where and then the edits they did and like you said
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.920]  they you the cameras are out in the open they're so arrogant
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:59.280]  that you're in nobody that they're they're about to edit this and deceive
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.120]  people and they don't even care and then once you stand up to them
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.400]  then they want to crush you like a bug i think they're humorous is going to be
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.560]  their downfall absolutely i totally agree i think it is a
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.760]  downfall and i've i've said to them numerous times
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.760]  now that if you think i'm going to go away
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.600]  by using the your standard techniques and trying to shut people down
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.680]  you are so wrong i encourage them to go and speak to my mom
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.600]  my mom will tell them how persistent i am i'm not giving up
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.080]  i'm going to take this all the way and at the moment we're looking at legal
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:37.040]  avenues and going back to the us and crashing
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.080]  i'm not but don't take it now you're one of the hottest guests ever
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.040]  that people are just going to Skype you in i mean you need to be on
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.120]  rogan and rogan and rogan only does face to face he needs it with banned
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.480]  political dissidents it needs to be skyped in
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:53.520]  yeah absolutely um and and the fact is you're right
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.120]  the fact is now that that i have been banned
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:02.240]  both online but even worse physically from entering the united states
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.800]  more people want to talk to me about what's happened
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.720]  so their whole i've seen like five of your videos in the last year
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.440]  when they when they already set you up i probably watched 20 i'm like this is a
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.800]  really nice well-spoken guy the thing is the thing is
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.560]  you're banned because you're well-spoken your common sense you're lovable
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.160]  you're promoting normal stuff you're not banned because you're a liar you're banned
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:27.440]  because you're telling the truth absolutely and you know the social
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:30.720]  media giants is scared of anybody that does
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:34.080]  tell the truth especially if they tell it
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:37.760]  with a smile on their face and without any hate in their heart
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:41.680]  and that that i will go back to that because you told them a
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.400]  you told them a month ago they said i'll do the interview but no white
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.360]  supremacist and they stick you right in the middle of it like you're a white
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:51.920]  supremacist absolutely um it was about 20 seconds
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.040]  into the video there was a probably one of astralia's most
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:00.240]  prominent white supremacists you know hitler fans
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.640]  um that that they've just kind of lumped in together with me mind you this
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:09.120]  this person hates me more than anyone probably just as much as the christ
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:15.280]  church killer himself so um they're trying all their
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:19.200]  their regular techniques to first smear you to
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:23.200]  delegitimize you to make you out to be something you're absolutely not
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.800]  i'm a proud australian i'm a proud israeli i love both australia
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:31.280]  israel i love the west i love our free democratic way of life
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:35.520]  and i'm always happy to defend my stances and i will go i go to a lot of
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:39.120]  these different events and when i challenge people i do it like i said
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:42.000]  with a smile on my face and usually i just hand them a little bit of
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.640]  right that's what they're scared of is black white
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:49.280]  old young muslim jew christian agnostic saying we like the west we like freedom
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.960]  we like open society they're so scared of that and that's why
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:57.680]  they're scared of you absolutely and uh because as laura said
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:03.120]  before we're not the right kind of jews we're not the right kind of uh you know
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:09.120]  ethnic uh minority we we are proud of what our countries
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.240]  stand for and we want to defend it so in closing i want to get you back this
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:19.120]  week for a full hour to take calls where do you see this crazy stuff going
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:22.320]  because i see just see trump as a unifier trying to empower everybody
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:25.760]  and so they attack him they do that to me that is a you they're so scared of
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:28.240]  people that really want to just want to work together
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:32.000]  then you read wiki leaks it's all about democrats creating cultural
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.440]  and racial and religious war i just i'm actually
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:43.200]  flummoxed polaxed uh thunder struck by how evil the left is i i just can't
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.800]  believe that they're this conscious a do you agree with that and b what's their
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:50.480]  end game absolutely i don't even know if they
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.680]  have an end game i think they're just so arrogant this is what i've learned
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:57.120]  through this whole experience is that they are so arrogant
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:01.360]  and blind to the truth and the reality of it that they don't realize that that
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:05.440]  is going to be their downfall and the fact is we have truth on our side and
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:11.120]  that is why ultimately we will win well you know they've got a problem
[01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:15.520]  when they know that i'm anti-racist and protest the klan like 15 times and all
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.480]  the rest of it and my family all of it i'm not going to get into it
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.760]  they know that's bs and they know it's bs when they call you a white supremacist
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.560]  or they call Laura Loomer they say white supremacist Laura Loomer was at
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:27.280]  congress and yelled it the head of twitter i mean that's
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:32.160]  like she's a Jewish Zionist the fact that they're so desperate calling
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:36.240]  Trump a white supremacist i think shows they're out of gas
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:40.080]  and and and they're going to fail you watch
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:44.640]  some of my uh videos you can see i i often wear the kipper on my head and
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:47.840]  it's less even in that jim jeffrey segment it's less
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:52.400]  about religious like about my faith it's more about exposing i grew up
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.560]  ultra orthodox but i wear it nowadays often to expose
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:59.440]  them for what they are you know i will rock up to events
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:04.080]  and literally the first thing they will say the first thing they will shout is
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.640]  other is a nazi and i just i'm looking around going
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:12.320]  i hope we got that on tape which i've got it numerous times now
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:15.600]  because it just shows that they have nothing that's all they've got well
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:19.040]  that's where i stand i was never against israel because i knew the history of it
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.840]  was going on and that it took israel over the muslims and kill each other
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.360]  forever over it you know uh sari rabbi won't take one so
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:28.640]  called palestinian but once they attack me for not being
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.440]  it's israel and once they thought oh look you're the
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.040]  i thought fine i'll just embrace this because it's not even real
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:38.880]  and so i wonder about the ultra right wing ultra left wing are unified
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:44.480]  in this in this in this attack not just on israel but it's just it's mental
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.080]  illness and then what the left's ally with islam and then
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:52.240]  it's a really sick two sides two two sides of the same coin i
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:57.920]  i find the right the left they literally push the same conspiracy theories
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.920]  especially about israel and jews um and what i find
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.240]  interesting is the unholy alliance between the left
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.240]  and these jihadis i was literally at a rally again you can see it on my youtube
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:12.560]  channel i was at a rally where there was
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:18.000]  hezbollah like proud hezbollah terrorists marching in our streets with
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  the terrorist flag and right in front of them
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.600]  posing in front of them was a transgender
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:28.800]  uh person they would kill them in a minute oh they have feminists all of
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:33.760]  them go a la akbar we want sharia law and they would kill them
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:38.480]  i turned to this person and i said listen these people that you're standing
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.240]  with they hate me they hate me more than anything they will kill me no i have no
