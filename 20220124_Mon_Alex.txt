[00:00.000 --> 00:15.600]  It's Monday, January 24th, 2022.
[00:15.600 --> 00:39.360]  Here we are, my friends, on this Monday, January 24th, 2022 transmission, I just had a very
[00:39.360 --> 00:46.120]  intense experience being interrogated by the January 6th committee lawyers.
[00:46.120 --> 00:53.320]  They were polite, but they were dogged, and I take the whole process very, very seriously
[00:53.320 --> 01:01.720]  because I know that Adam Schiff is a forger and has been caught faking emails and misquoting
[01:01.720 --> 01:08.960]  President Trump and claiming that, oh, here he is ordering the president of Ukraine, here's
[01:08.960 --> 01:14.760]  a transcript of him telling the president of Ukraine that he's a mafia don, he better
[01:14.760 --> 01:15.760]  follow his orders.
[01:15.760 --> 01:20.160]  I mean, it's scary when you walk into that, you know the power of Congress, the power
[01:20.160 --> 01:25.080]  of the US government that's gone in and destroyed the whole third world countries and killed
[01:25.080 --> 01:28.240]  millions of people just for profit and power.
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.440]  And when you're in their sights, you know that they can basically make up or do anything
[01:33.440 --> 01:36.960]  they want to a point.
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.000]  And the point is what we've reached now in society and civilization, and that's the
[01:41.000 --> 01:49.280]  live show headline today, that there has been a global collapse in confidence in the system.
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.560]  And the globalists had intended to have a collapse in the confidence in our general society,
[01:54.560 --> 01:58.480]  but as a process, they thought that they would then escape the blame for it.
[01:58.480 --> 02:06.040]  But that has not happened now, and the system has gotten the blame that it deserves.
[02:06.040 --> 02:16.120]  Now again, the globalists were intending to bring down part of our civilization and consolidate
[02:16.120 --> 02:22.160]  control throughout that process, but instead it's now backfiring on them.
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.120]  In fact, there's the headline, you can put it back on screen, that'd be wonderful.
[02:27.120 --> 02:34.800]  Monday Live, humanity is carrying out its own great reset against planet's corrupt elite.
[02:34.800 --> 02:38.480]  Globalist movements worldwide have done an excellent job of exposing the New World Order
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.800]  corporate kleptocrats and their divide and conquer agenda.
[02:42.800 --> 02:49.120]  The corporate deep state's attempt to consolidate power via controlled collapse is backfired,
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.880]  and they are now a victim of their own evil design.
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.960]  But the bad news is, like every tyrant and corrupt system in history, they're attempting
[02:58.960 --> 03:00.960]  to take us down with them.
[03:00.960 --> 03:07.160]  Come in now and learn how we can stop this terrible process that we've all been drug
[03:07.160 --> 03:08.160]  into.
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.360]  But I want to be clear, it's not all the corporate leaders that are our enemies, it's not everybody
[03:12.360 --> 03:15.600]  in governments that are our enemies, it's not the police that are our enemies or the
[03:15.600 --> 03:19.640]  black people or the white people that are our enemies, it is ignorant people that are
[03:19.640 --> 03:25.160]  the problem being manipulated by very, very corrupt individuals that seek more power and
[03:25.160 --> 03:26.160]  more control.
[03:26.160 --> 03:31.400]  And it's been our weakness as a society and a civilization, including mine and yours,
[03:31.400 --> 03:39.560]  that has allowed this level of evil to get control and to not feel like it has any checks
[03:39.560 --> 03:43.320]  and balances to what it's doing.
[03:43.320 --> 03:48.000]  You know, I personally became very popular on the radio very, very early, that's a lot
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.200]  of power to have, and I was always doing it really for the right reasons, but I still
[03:52.200 --> 03:57.800]  made mistakes and I still hurt people in the process, but it was done from a place of trying
[03:57.800 --> 03:58.800]  to be good.
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.240]  And I've certainly learned as I've gotten older to be more careful with the power I
[04:02.240 --> 04:05.120]  will, especially as that power has increased.
[04:05.120 --> 04:10.440]  That is not the normal process with the type of people that actually seek power.
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.160]  Most people would seek to be on the radio and TV so they could be famous, because they
[04:14.160 --> 04:16.200]  couldn't get a job in Hollywood.
[04:16.200 --> 04:22.000]  But I was offered the big jobs in Hollywood and turned them down because I genuinely wanted
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.680]  to be with the people in the common populace, and that's really my goal.
[04:26.680 --> 04:31.640]  But that said, it's been my own process of learning how I've been wrong that has helped
[04:31.640 --> 04:36.280]  me grow up and really see what's wrong with the people that are controlling our planet.
[04:36.280 --> 04:41.480]  Selfish, arrogant, hateful, disconnected from God, they're the people we don't want
[04:41.480 --> 04:42.480]  to be.
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.840]  Huge show lined up for you today, I promise to take my four-year-old daughter camping
[04:47.840 --> 04:48.840]  for months.
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.080]  I'm about to take a couple of days off and take her camping, but come up about 30 minutes,
[04:52.080 --> 04:53.080]  Owen Schroyer takes over.
[04:53.080 --> 05:01.040]  But first, I've got a lot of big news to head, stay with us.
[05:01.040 --> 05:06.440]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[05:06.440 --> 05:08.480]  a healthier life.
[05:08.480 --> 05:12.320]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.960]  that contains both.
[05:13.960 --> 05:18.920]  This InfoWars life-offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[05:18.920 --> 05:20.520]  from the InfoWars store.
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.360]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[05:25.360 --> 05:28.080]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[05:28.080 --> 05:33.280]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[05:33.280 --> 05:37.600]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.600]  shown.
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.880]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.480]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.440]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[05:52.440 --> 05:53.440]  like here in America.
[05:53.440 --> 05:58.280]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[05:58.280 --> 06:13.600]  our rose hips don't lie.
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.680]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.680 --> 06:28.720]  Now, you're joining us on this live teleprompter tree, Monday, January 24, 2022, transmission.
[06:28.720 --> 06:31.560]  And I just ended it a little less than an hour ago.
[06:31.560 --> 06:43.360]  My testimony via Cisco systems, I guess it wasn't Zoom or Skype, a connection, an interview,
[06:43.360 --> 06:50.600]  I guess testimony deposition is the word, with the January 6 committee.
[06:50.600 --> 06:53.440]  And it was extremely interesting to say the least.
[06:53.440 --> 06:57.760]  I wrote some notes here that I just want to get out of the way because it is newsworthy
[06:57.760 --> 06:58.760]  and important.
[06:58.760 --> 07:01.400]  And then I'm going to move on to the other big news, and I want Shroyer is coming in
[07:01.400 --> 07:07.600]  to take over because I, again, I'm taking my four and a half year old daughter camping.
[07:07.600 --> 07:12.640]  She really loves to run around the woods and have bonfires and feed the horses out at my
[07:12.640 --> 07:14.040]  family's place in these Texas.
[07:14.040 --> 07:19.200]  So about to take a few days off, despite looming war with Russia and all the other insane things
[07:19.200 --> 07:26.160]  that are going on, you got to sometimes let your engine cool down as they say.
[07:26.160 --> 07:30.800]  So Owen Shroyer is taking over, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[07:30.800 --> 07:36.400]  But I said this, my lawyer told me almost 100 times today during the interrogation,
[07:36.400 --> 07:41.800]  on advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
[07:41.800 --> 07:46.680]  And the media tells you that's because you're guilty or because you're going to incriminate
[07:46.680 --> 07:47.680]  yourself.
[07:47.680 --> 07:53.240]  But it's also just because it could be used to try to incriminate you and twist something
[07:53.240 --> 07:54.240]  against you.
[07:54.240 --> 08:01.160]  Adam Schiff is famous for creating fake quotes and fake transcripts and fake emails and fake
[08:01.160 --> 08:03.920]  text messages and fake conversations with people.
[08:03.920 --> 08:07.040]  I don't have to go over the list of them, but you know the famous one where he goes,
[08:07.040 --> 08:11.920]  let me read a transcript of the phone call with Trump and the president of Ukraine.
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.720]  I'm the boss, you know, like the Godfather, do what I say or you'll be destroyed.
[08:16.720 --> 08:17.720]  You don't call me.
[08:17.720 --> 08:18.720]  I call you.
[08:18.720 --> 08:19.720]  Is that clear?
[08:19.720 --> 08:22.120]  You'll fire that prosecutor.
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.120]  All lies.
[08:23.120 --> 08:28.360]  In fact, that's basically a transcript of what Biden said a few years before on the
[08:28.360 --> 08:32.040]  Council on Foreign Relations stage on C-SPAN.
[08:32.040 --> 08:38.560]  Biden actually said, I called him up and said, you better fire that prosecutor or I'll hold
[08:38.560 --> 08:39.760]  back a billion dollars.
[08:39.760 --> 08:43.600]  I get on a plane in six hours, but it ain't done.
[08:43.600 --> 08:44.600]  You're not getting a billion dollars.
[08:44.600 --> 08:45.600]  Son of a bitch.
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.640]  They fired him and they got the billion dollars.
[08:47.640 --> 08:54.480]  I mean, so you can't walk in to something like that with people like that.
[08:54.480 --> 08:58.080]  I don't know who these lawyers are running it.
[08:58.080 --> 09:00.200]  I don't know if they're good people or bad people.
[09:00.200 --> 09:02.880]  They came almost polite and nice.
[09:02.880 --> 09:08.760]  But when you've got predators like Schiff back in the background like a moray eel in
[09:08.760 --> 09:14.640]  the rocks ready to come out and eat you, then there's no reason to even dignify it because
[09:14.640 --> 09:15.640]  it's not legitimate.
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.360]  Plus, the committee did not constitute the proper members of the Republican Party.
[09:20.360 --> 09:23.240]  It didn't allow the Republican Party to put forward its members.
[09:23.240 --> 09:25.480]  It refused most of those members.
[09:25.480 --> 09:30.480]  Now they've got that Rhino, Republican name only, Liz Cheney on there.
[09:30.480 --> 09:41.200]  But that said, the questions were overall pretty reasonable and I wanted to answer the questions.
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.120]  But at the same time, it's a good thing I didn't because I'm the type that tries to
[09:46.120 --> 09:50.240]  answer things correctly even if I don't know all the answers and they can then kind of
[09:50.240 --> 09:51.240]  claim that that's perjury.
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.760]  Because about half the questions I didn't know the answer to and a bunch of more emails
[09:56.760 --> 10:04.680]  I'd never seen and planning things I'd never seen, at least from memory.
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.240]  But then who knows, somebody might say, oh, you saw that member at dinner and I'm like,
[10:08.240 --> 10:15.400]  I don't remember because it was all one big blur and I just kind of jumped in the river
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.280]  of the million people in DC and floated down it.
[10:18.280 --> 10:23.720]  You're not in control of the river when you're floating on a tube down the rapids.
[10:23.720 --> 10:29.240]  So I've got their questions here that I obviously couldn't answer under oath because then they
[10:29.240 --> 10:33.560]  could, if I said something even halfway wrong, put me in prison and so I'm not going to give
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.360]  shifts and those people what they want, just too dangerous of a process.
[10:38.360 --> 10:41.880]  But they did have some questions that were important.
[10:41.880 --> 10:47.600]  Again, they have everything that's already on my phones and things because I saw my text
[10:47.600 --> 10:54.680]  messages to Caroline Wren and Cindy Shafien and some of the event organizers right there.
[10:54.680 --> 10:57.680]  So they already have everything and they already know I didn't do anything.
[10:57.680 --> 10:59.040]  I wasn't planning any violence.
[10:59.040 --> 11:02.440]  I was even talking about everybody should be peaceful.
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.240]  Again, I did not know a lot of the questions they asked.
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.240]  I had not seen the Matt Bracken clip from December 31st, 2020 when he was guest hosting
[11:12.240 --> 11:15.880]  because I hadn't watched when he was guest hosting.
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.920]  And I had only seen it once they sent me the subpoena a few months ago.
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.200]  And quite frankly, I was shocked by it because I'd never seen Matt Bracken basically call
[11:24.200 --> 11:25.200]  for things like that.
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.200]  He was always the opposite.
[11:26.200 --> 11:31.880]  He was always saying look out for provocateurs and look out for federal plants.
[11:31.880 --> 11:34.720]  And he didn't normally do my show wearing an infowars shirt all the background.
[11:34.720 --> 11:42.440]  I even noticed he's like an infowars guy and then it's six days before January 6th and
[11:42.440 --> 11:49.720]  he's basically calling for what happened that day.
[11:49.720 --> 11:51.040]  But oh, he wasn't there that day.
[11:51.040 --> 11:55.680]  He was up at the Washington Monument if you believe him.
[11:55.680 --> 12:01.080]  I'm not going to read into whether he's a bad guy, whether he's a provocateur or whether
[12:01.080 --> 12:03.680]  he just got hyped up in the emotion of the time.
[12:03.680 --> 12:07.480]  But to answer the committee's question, hell no, I don't support that.
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.520]  And that's not what we stand for.
[12:09.520 --> 12:14.840]  And speaking of capitals, they showed that photo that was all over the news of myself
[12:14.840 --> 12:21.320]  and Oli Alexander, Oli Alexander, Alex Jones at Georgia Capitol, you guys probably search
[12:21.320 --> 12:22.320]  engine and find it.
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.880]  And it's he and I walking up the steps to then have a photo shoot with a few hundred people
[12:27.880 --> 12:34.200]  that peacefully went in with the agreement of the state police and the Capitol police
[12:34.200 --> 12:41.160]  with Vernon Jones, a former state rep, I believe, really nice guy.
[12:41.160 --> 12:43.200]  He said, would you like to go in the Capitol?
[12:43.200 --> 12:44.480]  I was quite frankly tired.
[12:44.480 --> 12:47.800]  I've been there having a demonstration, calling for an investigation in the election.
[12:47.800 --> 12:49.480]  I didn't really want to go in.
[12:49.480 --> 12:50.480]  We'd given our speech outside.
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.800]  I want to go back to the hotel and eat a cheeseburger and do my show.
[12:54.800 --> 12:57.200]  But Oli Alexander and Jones wanted to do it.
[12:57.200 --> 12:58.560]  So we went to the metal detectors.
[12:58.560 --> 13:00.800]  That took an hour and a half.
[13:00.800 --> 13:07.000]  We went inside, we had a peaceful event, and we left.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.880]  So that was our goal.
[13:09.880 --> 13:13.840]  And they asked who organized that and who planned that.
[13:13.840 --> 13:20.000]  I mean, I remember there were demonstrations already going on in Georgia.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.760]  And so as best I can remember, we just went there to be part of the demonstrations to
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.000]  cover it, to be part of it.
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.720]  And then there's Vernon Jones, I think I'll tell you his name, an African American fellow,
[13:31.720 --> 13:37.080]  a really nice, really smart guy, also spoke on January 6th in D.C.
[13:37.080 --> 13:39.600]  And so he invited us since we did the event.
[13:39.600 --> 13:47.120]  They asked me if we were with Proud Boys, or if we were with Oathkeepers, and I do remember
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.400]  being at a Hooters that was by our hotel eating and having, you know, there were some Proud
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.080]  Boys in there that sat down and we drank a beer and ate cheeseburgers again.
[13:56.080 --> 13:58.320]  So yeah, there's your answer there.
[13:58.320 --> 14:01.200]  There's Vernon Jones with his arm around my shoulder.
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.880]  And so that was what we had, was a very friendly, very nice event.
[14:05.880 --> 14:07.680]  There wasn't any violence.
[14:07.680 --> 14:12.520]  I'm told a few weeks later Antifa came out and there was some scuffles and ongoing demonstrations.
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.400]  But all I know is what I saw and what I witnessed.
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.560]  So there's the answer to that.
[14:19.560 --> 14:22.760]  They kept asking me, who was your White House connection?
[14:22.760 --> 14:23.760]  Or who was it?
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.000]  Well, I mean, I knew that Caroline Wren was a big fundraiser, headed up one of Trump's
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.200]  PACs.
[14:28.200 --> 14:31.760]  And I knew that she and D, when I talked to other people, said, yeah, she's the one that
[14:31.760 --> 14:32.760]  sets up these events.
[14:32.760 --> 14:35.640]  It's not the White House itself that sets up events, but when you say the White House,
[14:35.640 --> 14:37.360]  it's the contact in the White House.
[14:37.360 --> 14:44.360]  So yes, that was my contact for the 5th and the 6th was Caroline Wren.
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.120]  And that's what I called White House Contact.
[14:46.120 --> 14:50.560]  And she's there that day behind the stage with the Trumps and the family and talking
[14:50.560 --> 14:55.000]  to Secret Service and the Secret Service in uniform, come over and open the gate up and
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.080]  do direct us out and do lead us back to the back of the stage so we could then go and
[15:03.080 --> 15:05.640]  get around the crowd, try to go lead the march.
[15:05.640 --> 15:09.120]  But by then, a million people were there, hundreds of thousands had already marched
[15:09.120 --> 15:11.640]  to the Capitol.
[15:11.640 --> 15:12.640]  And we come back.
[15:12.640 --> 15:13.760]  I keep meaning to play this video.
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.280]  For some reason, we never do as B-roll, but it's going to happen next segment.
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.680]  Just watch.
[15:18.680 --> 15:20.520]  And that's footage I and others shot.
[15:20.520 --> 15:25.240]  There's a lot of these clips of once we figured out the people had gone on the Capitol and
[15:25.240 --> 15:27.480]  we couldn't stop it, we tried.
[15:27.480 --> 15:33.680]  We went up on the roof and I'll show you the size of these crowds.
[15:33.680 --> 15:35.280]  You never see this footage on the news.
[15:35.280 --> 15:38.640]  This is only a small part of them.
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.000]  Just to give you an idea of how what a tiny group went in the Capitol, there's just oceans
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.760]  of every street and road full of people.
[15:43.760 --> 15:44.760]  It's a million people.
[15:44.760 --> 15:45.760]  A million.
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.320]  It's what the DC police estimated.
[15:49.320 --> 15:54.080]  And the idea that that could be controlled, I mean, I just know it was led by provocateurs
[15:54.080 --> 15:59.680]  into a crisis.
[15:59.680 --> 16:03.240]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill.
[16:03.240 --> 16:08.960]  And it is the fastest growing market in supplements in the world, for good reason.
[16:08.960 --> 16:11.280]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there.
[16:11.280 --> 16:16.240]  Some healthy, some not that do incredible things in our brains.
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.400]  And we've tried them all.
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.040]  We've researched them all and we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems
[16:22.040 --> 16:27.480]  or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers because I'm not saying some of our
[16:27.480 --> 16:28.480]  brain products.
[16:28.480 --> 16:30.640]  You won't have a little bit of a let down once you take them, but that would just be
[16:30.640 --> 16:31.640]  a lie.
[16:31.640 --> 16:35.480]  But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.160]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock.

[17:09.880 --> 17:14.080]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset, we can't get these products

[18:03.360 --> 18:05.560]  why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate.
[18:05.560 --> 18:11.560]  Bone broth and we could never get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and
[18:11.560 --> 18:13.720]  not just use the same ingredients.

[18:59.080 --> 19:04.920]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking bad about the vaccines are
[19:04.920 --> 19:12.600]  working for quote, dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these
[19:12.600 --> 19:14.840]  evil groups are.
[19:14.840 --> 19:19.160]  They know that all over the world their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[19:19.160 --> 19:21.960]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[19:21.960 --> 19:26.840]  They know that the people are starting to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.040]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount that the shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons
[19:31.040 --> 19:37.480]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front and so people are waking
[19:37.480 --> 19:38.600]  up.
[19:38.600 --> 19:41.520]  The weapons work a little too good.
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.720]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars but instead they're making too
[19:45.720 --> 19:46.720]  big of a noise.
[19:46.720 --> 19:49.560]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[19:49.560 --> 19:51.320]  They're coming after our children.
[19:51.320 --> 19:56.720]  So it's up to us to protect our little children or God will not look favorably on us.
[19:56.720 --> 19:57.720]  Never.
[19:57.720 --> 20:01.120]  God is watching.
[20:01.120 --> 20:15.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:15.120 --> 20:30.720]  It was mission impossible when a million people showed up and they cut the amount of capital
[20:30.720 --> 20:31.720]  police in half.
[20:31.720 --> 20:36.440]  But even the full contingent of capital police couldn't stop even 10,000 people that wanted
[20:36.440 --> 20:38.360]  to break into the capital.
[20:38.360 --> 20:43.440]  Much less a million people there thinking they were going to hear Trump speak and by the
[20:43.440 --> 20:50.000]  time a few hundred broke in, 800 or so, now they're saying maybe 2,000, weighted their
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.520]  way into the capital having no idea what was going on.
[20:55.520 --> 21:00.400]  If you're a TV viewer, you see some of the footage I shot from the rooftop, you could
[21:00.400 --> 21:06.000]  then pan all the way around and see all the other streets full of people and it went on
[21:06.000 --> 21:07.000]  for hours.
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.720]  You have to understand what I just showed you on TV was in the afternoon.
[21:12.720 --> 21:18.200]  Next I got up on the roof when I was unable to stop people going in the building and again,
[21:18.200 --> 21:19.920]  we didn't know Ashley Babin had been shot.
[21:19.920 --> 21:24.920]  A red flare got shot up by police and that's when my security said, I don't know if they
[21:24.920 --> 21:29.480]  use the same military terminology, but a red flare means somebody just got killed or shot.
[21:29.480 --> 21:31.000]  We need to get out of here.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.560]  We're not stopping this because by then we learned there were a bunch of people inside
[21:34.560 --> 21:40.840]  the capital and that was so stupid and so dumb and we do not support that.
[21:40.840 --> 21:42.760]  I didn't support it that day.
[21:42.760 --> 21:51.800]  I don't support it now, but I don't support that million people that came there and a
[21:51.800 --> 21:55.360]  tiny fraction went in the capital and they're all being called terrorists.
[21:55.360 --> 22:03.680]  My personal doctor didn't even go to the capital and they raided her house last year, raided
[22:03.680 --> 22:12.320]  her with a SWAT team just to see what she had and what she had done, a medical doctor.
[22:12.320 --> 22:17.920]  She thought maybe it was because she's my doctor, but the doctor that owns the clinic's
[22:17.920 --> 22:23.320]  quasi-retired, so she just been my doctor recently and I just got to get the checkups,
[22:23.320 --> 22:31.760]  blood work done, like once a year, so that's how crazy this is.
[22:31.760 --> 22:41.720]  That's how big this dragnet is.
[22:41.720 --> 22:49.480]  They kept asking me, did we use Oath Keepers and did we use Proud Boys as security?
[22:49.480 --> 22:51.080]  I hire professional security.
[22:51.080 --> 22:55.800]  I'm not putting these people down, but I get mobbed in these big crowds and big crowds
[22:55.800 --> 22:59.360]  are dangerous as anybody knows just because people can stampede or there could be a backfire
[22:59.360 --> 23:02.680]  from a bus and they're dangerous.
[23:02.680 --> 23:08.160]  So yeah, I had 12 or 14 security people for all those big events because when you're
[23:08.160 --> 23:11.200]  out in the middle of hundreds of thousands of people, you need that just to be able to
[23:11.200 --> 23:18.600]  get places and so I hired DC and Maryland police and I hired a well-known private security
[23:18.600 --> 23:25.360]  company here in Austin that is bonded and works for not going to name names, but the
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.360]  people that work for me have worked for the richest people in the world, the biggest government
[23:30.360 --> 23:32.000]  people, all of it.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.120]  They guarded Hillary Clinton, they guarded Joe Biden, they guarded Michael Bloomberg,
[23:37.120 --> 23:42.480]  I'll just say the names and so I go and try to get professional people and of course there's
[23:42.480 --> 23:48.680]  no way I had DC police and Maryland police off duty with us trying to do an insurrection.
[23:48.680 --> 23:53.960]  By the way, the company we hired was all black guys, the four or five times we went to DC
[23:53.960 --> 23:57.720]  because that's the company that had good ratings, but people we hired, I mean big black guys,
[23:57.720 --> 24:06.280]  they were all based on the size of NFL linemen, I mean 6'8", 6'6", with the little guys,
[24:06.280 --> 24:13.960]  arms this big around, I mean yeah, they were Democrats most, I think basically nonpartisan,
[24:13.960 --> 24:18.320]  leaning liberal, so no, we didn't go in some premeditated plan, we didn't believe the
[24:18.320 --> 24:24.560]  Capitol was being attacked with the DC and Maryland black police, give me a damn break
[24:24.560 --> 24:30.360]  and we got the hell out of there once we couldn't stop it.
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.440]  Trump thought there might be 30,000 people that came to DC, I set the ellipse up for
[24:34.440 --> 24:40.360]  that, Trump could not believe it, according to all the sources out there that there was
[24:40.360 --> 24:46.040]  a million people, he kept marveling at it, he was super excited and he has a tendency
[24:46.040 --> 24:49.720]  and I believe this quote I've heard from witnesses of the committee that he told Mark Meadows,
[24:49.720 --> 24:54.040]  oh I told him I'd meet him down there, but I really wasn't going to go, I might drive
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.240]  by or fly the helicopter over, because he did that at our other events and I was just
[24:59.240 --> 25:06.360]  about to leave with my wife who was freezing to go back to the hotel and drink coffee and
[25:06.360 --> 25:10.920]  take a hot shower and not even be part of the Capitol thing, because I found it hard
[25:10.920 --> 25:16.040]  to believe from our, I want to say a White House source, campaign has to run events,
[25:16.040 --> 25:22.000]  but it's liaison within the White House, Caroline Wren and I'm like, yeah, let's just get out
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.520]  of here and I was talking to Enlo who was with me, I took one security guy in to the
[25:26.520 --> 25:32.080]  ellipse, our other security was outside and because that's a contained area with a secret
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.440]  service stuff where Trump was speaking with this 900,000 or other people around it, I'm
[25:36.440 --> 25:41.160]  like, you know, maybe we just won't do this, because they're like, and then all of a sudden
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.040]  she's back there with all the secret service of people, she comes and opens the gate, they
[25:45.040 --> 25:49.760]  come over, they get me, they lead us through, whatever it was, it was uniformed people,
[25:49.760 --> 25:55.680]  you see, said secret service, we go back and we get let out, and then I'm giving the mission
[25:55.680 --> 26:02.960]  impossible job with a bullhorn that you can maybe reach a thousand people with, to midstream
[26:02.960 --> 26:07.200]  jump on Pennsylvania Avenue, where already God knows, at least over a hundred thousand
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.000]  had gone before us, I don't know how many, but see a people to try to then control that.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.120]  People ask, well, then why'd you get up and try to stop it?
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.400]  That's a little uppity, no, it wasn't that, I mean, I felt like, I knew Olly had this
[26:19.400 --> 26:22.800]  lot eight thing, I sound like a pipe green that Trump was going to come speak, but I
[26:22.800 --> 26:26.280]  hadn't, I just trusted everybody, I thought, okay, sure, we've done all these other big
[26:26.280 --> 26:30.520]  events, you're like, hey, you're going to speak at the Jericho event, and you go there
[26:30.520 --> 26:33.560]  and it's a big setup and speakers, and you show up and you go up and you give a ten-minute
[26:33.560 --> 26:42.600]  speech and you're done, same thing January 5th, and so I can tell you what happened here
[26:42.600 --> 26:48.120]  and just give you the basics of it, you make one little mistake talking to that committee
[26:48.120 --> 26:52.200]  about what day something was under whatever, they don't care if it's obvious it's political,
[26:52.200 --> 26:56.680]  they don't care, they got juries in D.C. that would convict a newborn baby and put it to
[26:56.680 --> 27:03.760]  death in order to do so, for breathing, seriously, I've seen it, and so you can't go into something
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.600]  like that, you can't deal with something at that level of corruption, I'm sorry, and
[27:09.600 --> 27:13.520]  so the whole thing is tainted, it's like a big bowl of soup, you put one rat turd in
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.480]  it, it's no good, well, this has got like hundreds of rat turds in it, and I'm not
[27:17.480 --> 27:22.480]  eating the soup, but I'll tell the public what really went on, I want to say this to
[27:22.480 --> 27:25.440]  the committee too, because I know they're watching, they say they watch every day basically,
[27:25.440 --> 27:31.880]  and all these clips, or they imply they watch all the time.
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.520]  The background noise of this, they ask me, did you hear of any plans for violence, yeah,
[27:36.520 --> 27:39.760]  the Democrats, we're going to burn everything down, you know, give us what you want, you
[27:39.760 --> 27:43.600]  see politicians or Republicans getting their face, the military is going to march Trump
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.880]  out, we're going to have military tribunals, we're going to arrest all the Trump supporters,
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.680]  we're going to have the military coup against Trump, we're going to, I mean, we heard all
[27:52.680 --> 27:59.560]  that from Pelosi and Maxine Waters on them, so that raised the background noise of garbage,
[27:59.560 --> 28:04.200]  and so yeah, all over talk radio, all over everywhere, there was, you know, headlines
[28:04.200 --> 28:08.760]  about insurrection acts, and Trump was all over the news, but I was getting this from
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.360]  the news, like everybody else, I didn't say I was an insider, I didn't say I had all
[28:14.360 --> 28:20.640]  the answers, I was basically following the political system of going through the, who
[28:20.640 --> 28:26.480]  was the designated campaign pack manager to run speeches and events.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.840]  When Trump goes and gives speech folks, it's not the White House running that, it's not
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.440]  government money paying for that, when Trump comes to Pennsylvania or Texas to give a speech,
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.680]  that's paid for by the campaign, that's paid for by donations, so there's also that confusion
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.360]  going on, I went there to have a peaceful political rally to put peaceful political pressure on
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.360]  Congress, to have a 10 day investigation by the Senate, because that's what I thought
[28:48.360 --> 28:51.800]  was right, it's what my listeners wanted, and that was my motive, and it's what I did,
[28:51.800 --> 28:55.720]  and it's a horrible, historic fiasco, and I wish it would have never happened, we'll
[28:55.720 --> 28:59.840]  be right back, stay with us.

[29:28.880 --> 29:31.600]  have a little bit of a let down, once you take them, that would just be a lie, but these

[30:57.360 --> 30:59.240]  at 40% off.
[30:59.240 --> 31:04.680]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply
[31:04.680 --> 31:06.360]  chain breakdowns.
[31:06.360 --> 31:09.920]  We've done a great job supporting InfoWars and supporting your immune system.
[31:09.920 --> 31:14.120]  The problem is, with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset, we can't get these products
[31:14.120 --> 31:15.120]  in.
[31:15.120 --> 31:20.720]  So finally, they came in, but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential,
[31:20.720 --> 31:25.560]  nutrient multivitamins, so you absorb it, and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic
[31:25.560 --> 31:26.560]  vitamins.
[31:26.560 --> 31:28.480]  Then of course, vitamin C and zinc.
[31:28.480 --> 31:34.400]  This sucker is really full and heavy because it's a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and
[31:34.400 --> 31:35.400]  rose hips.
[31:35.400 --> 31:38.360]  The number one thing you can do if you're immune system and your body, it does so much

[31:44.960 --> 31:47.960]  that price until they sell out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[31:47.960 --> 31:53.160]  We've got a limited run, so please take action now and order them at InfoWarsTour.com, but
[31:53.160 --> 31:56.920]  whatever you do, find similar products out there and use them because this is a life
[31:56.920 --> 31:58.920]  and death situation to be healthy.
[31:58.920 --> 32:06.280]  Get our great bag of it here, I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas,
[32:06.280 --> 32:07.520]  Mexico, the communists?
[32:07.520 --> 32:12.800]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[32:12.800 --> 32:16.600]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from the little
[32:16.600 --> 32:20.520]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune, and whatever
[32:20.520 --> 32:24.080]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it, and the farmers don't let the
[32:24.080 --> 32:27.160]  Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels, and I've
[32:27.160 --> 32:29.760]  been buying it for, what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[32:29.760 --> 32:34.200]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, per pound, and I
[32:34.200 --> 32:36.640]  just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[32:36.640 --> 32:41.240]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm not
[32:41.240 --> 32:48.160]  going to tell you a little story, we had like that, I'm not saying you wouldn't believe it.
[32:48.160 --> 32:53.160]  Anyway, so it's InfoWarsTour.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[32:53.160 --> 33:00.160]  fund us, you don't want to see it, that's fine.
[33:00.160 --> 33:21.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.160 --> 33:39.560]  Alright, I got some final information I want to hit on the January 6th Committee, and where
[33:39.560 --> 33:44.320]  all this is going, and then I got a bunch of other news, I'm going to go ahead and take
[33:44.320 --> 33:48.160]  the rest of the hour, and Owen Schreuer is loaded for Barry, he's going to host the second
[33:48.160 --> 33:52.280]  and third hour today, then Gerald Salentes in the fourth, and then Owen comes back for
[33:52.280 --> 33:57.960]  the vaunted war room, and remember the reason I take this so serious is, Owen Schreuer has
[33:57.960 --> 34:06.400]  been charged with attacking the capital, disorderly conduct, a bunch of stuff he didn't do, and
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.720]  is facing years in prison, so that's why this is so dangerous, not just to myself, but the
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.600]  whole country and the whole world, but to finish up my statements to the January 6th Committee,
[34:17.600 --> 34:22.200]  because I can't say it under oath, because if I said that the background behind me is
[34:22.200 --> 34:28.160]  purple, they would say, well, actually, there's some black in it, so it's not really purple,
[34:28.160 --> 34:35.320]  you lied, prison, five years, and so when you're dealing with that level of stuff, you
[34:35.320 --> 34:41.280]  can't talk to them, because they'll twist everything you say, I've witnessed this time
[34:41.280 --> 34:49.240]  and time again, but to answer the other few questions here, did I hear about violence?
[34:49.240 --> 34:56.880]  And the answer is, yeah, all over the news, Democrats were calling for burning down the
[34:56.880 --> 35:02.040]  cities for killing Trump and his family, New York Times writers, Washington Post writers,
[35:02.040 --> 35:08.160]  Hollywood comedians, they were all saying kill Trump, kill his family, kill Trump supporters,
[35:08.160 --> 35:11.640]  Antifa was shooting Trump supporters in the back of the head all over the country, cops
[35:11.640 --> 35:16.880]  were getting shot, Antifa was firebombing federal buildings, they attacked the Portland
[35:16.880 --> 35:22.080]  federal courthouse, what was it, almost 100 days in a row, they attacked police with hatchets,
[35:22.080 --> 35:29.000]  the then vice presidential candidate bailed them out of jail, Antifa was coming to members
[35:29.000 --> 35:34.320]  of Congress houses bashing on their doors and breaking windows out, and so yeah, that
[35:34.320 --> 35:40.560]  raised the temperature a lot, but I heard no one around me call for offensive violence
[35:40.560 --> 35:46.440]  or talk about any plans for violence, I saw rhetoric on conservative TV and radio about
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.720]  it will might be a civil war and you know, it might be time of the Second Amendment,
[35:50.720 --> 35:58.400]  that was a background noise, but you always hear that in politics in America, in hell,
[35:58.400 --> 36:02.480]  you can read a dozen articles this week with Democrat publications, talking about shooting
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.120]  wars and what it's going to look like in the breakup of the country, let's get something
[36:07.120 --> 36:12.040]  clear for the committee and for my audience and everybody else, I don't want a civil
[36:12.040 --> 36:17.040]  war in this country and that's a terrible idea, and I don't want lawlessness by anybody
[36:17.040 --> 36:23.000]  and I don't want anybody attacking anybody, okay, now do I use rhetoric like if you want
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.640]  to fight, you better believe you got one, yeah, in the info war, it's time for us to
[36:27.640 --> 36:32.720]  stand up in the info war and say, I don't know how this is going to end, but if you
[36:32.720 --> 36:40.440]  want to fight, you better believe you've got one, in the info war, that's what that means
[36:40.440 --> 36:47.040]  over there, info war means we fight with information, we fight with the truth, that's the whole
[36:47.040 --> 36:55.560]  point is it's a nonviolent war, that's what Alex Jones does, he fights with words, the
[36:55.560 --> 37:04.400]  pen is mightier than the sword, the word processor is mightier than the tank, newspaper ink is
[37:04.400 --> 37:10.160]  more powerful than nuclear weapons because it can stop people from using them, and as
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.160]  they say in the 1983 TV show or movie, war games, the only way to win this game is not
[37:16.160 --> 37:22.920]  to play, I have children, I don't want a war, a war is not going to fix this, it's a global
[37:22.920 --> 37:28.280]  corporate corruption we have using behavioral psychology to manipulate us against each other,
[37:28.280 --> 37:34.560]  it's done this, and I knew that 10 years ago and I really know that now, and I have a real
[37:34.560 --> 37:38.560]  sense of foreboding with the situation with Russia and with our borders and the economy
[37:38.560 --> 37:44.520]  and the collapsing cities and all of it, and we better as Americans and as humans, keep
[37:44.520 --> 37:53.760]  our distance from violence and not be a party to it offensively, defend yourself all the
[37:53.760 --> 37:54.760]  way.
[37:54.760 --> 37:58.880]  So they also ask the question basically, or we're trying to get at the question, well
[37:58.880 --> 38:02.960]  do you use health keepers as security, do you use proud boys as security?
[38:02.960 --> 38:08.840]  I had my own security, but obviously everywhere we went people followed us around of every
[38:08.840 --> 38:14.680]  different type and every different group, and Stuart Rhodes, I later learned from news
[38:14.680 --> 38:19.360]  articles, would assign someone to us because he was kind of doing the whole playing the
[38:19.360 --> 38:25.760]  general type thing, and I saw it all as larping, I mean I didn't see the health keepers as
[38:25.760 --> 38:32.520]  bad people, but I saw a lot of it as playing soldier in the backyard, and they do go out
[38:32.520 --> 38:37.000]  to burning cities and try to help businesses, and that's not larping, that's real, their
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.280]  mission was something I really agreed with for most of its operations, but if the indictment
[38:44.280 --> 38:50.160]  is true that they thought that they could foment and kick start and detonate a rebellion
[38:50.160 --> 38:54.960]  at the capitol that would then lead to a larger war, that is not something I knew about or
[38:54.960 --> 39:00.520]  something I support or something I want, so again you're really getting my unofficial
[39:00.520 --> 39:05.560]  testimony here to the committee so I can speak off the cup and tell you as accurately and
[39:05.560 --> 39:09.360]  truthfully as I can what's going on, because I want the audience to know this too, and
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.520]  the audience is like, Alex we know, we listen to the show, we know you don't want violence,
[39:13.520 --> 39:17.480]  we know you weren't part of it, we know you were pissed that day, you know, I was screaming
[39:17.480 --> 39:21.560]  at the crew and just frothing mad at what a disaster it was, and I wasn't mad at the
[39:21.560 --> 39:27.480]  crew, I was just in having a fit, and they're like, hey the Democrats storm capitals all
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.520]  the time and burn stuff, I mean sure it's not good boss, but I mean we're not as bad
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.040]  as they are, and I was like, they're gonna make this the end of the world, they're gonna
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.400]  try to launch martial law, they're gonna make us all terrorists, they're gonna never shut
[39:40.400 --> 39:47.560]  up about this, and sure enough that's what happened, so I know how the media works, Democrats
[39:47.560 --> 39:50.800]  can run around and murder and kill whoever they want, it's cute and funny and sweet,
[39:50.800 --> 39:54.640]  Republicans do the wrong thing, we're all the blame, like some crazy person goes out
[39:54.640 --> 39:57.880]  and shoots somebody with a gun, and then all gun owners are the blame, I know how this
[39:57.880 --> 40:08.160]  works, so that's what's going on with that, and that's the basics of what I wanted to
[40:08.160 --> 40:15.000]  get to, and let me answer the question like this in the final equation, because this is
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.040]  what the whole broadcast for me today is really about, it's what yesterday's Sunday show that
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.720]  I thought was really informative was about, you should find it at Bandod Video and share
[40:22.720 --> 40:28.440]  it, we put the show headline up guys, again thank you so much to the crew for putting
[40:28.440 --> 40:35.160]  up with me, Monday Live, humanity is carrying out its own great reset against the planets
[40:35.160 --> 40:43.060]  corrupt elite, there is a populist movement of every color, of every race, of every persuasion
[40:43.060 --> 40:48.600]  that just wants freedom, and wants civilization, and powerful corporate interests have doubled
[40:48.600 --> 40:53.640]  their wealth the last two years, well the average person has lost more than 25% of their
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.520]  wealth, and tens of millions of people have gone into poverty, and tens of millions have
[40:57.520 --> 41:03.160]  starved to death extra according to the UN's own numbers, not from the virus, but from
[41:03.160 --> 41:10.720]  the lockdown from the virus that Klaus Schwab Braggs was carried out for a great reset,
[41:10.720 --> 41:15.320]  and the great news is, the world's waking up and all these main line liberals are coming
[41:15.320 --> 41:22.020]  out against the scam, and against the biomedical tyranny, and saying no, and people are realizing
[41:22.020 --> 41:26.720]  that their own common sense has been left at the door, and that their own common interest
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.400]  are being destroyed by the globalist, and that it doesn't matter, we have to get out
[41:30.400 --> 41:35.920]  of groups, it's fun to get in groups, I cut my teeth on saying, we must get rid of the
[41:35.920 --> 41:40.600]  left right paradigm and come together as populist, which I agree with, and then I saw Trump as
[41:40.600 --> 41:45.120]  a populist movement, but still they were able to just balkanize people even more with Trump,
[41:45.120 --> 41:50.880]  so it became more destructive in a way, and now I see that in hindsight.
[41:50.880 --> 41:56.720]  And so the UN talks about unity all day, but really all they're doing is creating 24-7
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.960]  division in the name of unity, and their whole globalist system is going down, and so they're
[42:02.960 --> 42:08.320]  trying to take us with them, with cultural division, with civil war, with violence, and
[42:08.320 --> 42:09.320]  they brag about it.
[42:09.320 --> 42:15.200]  Their only hope is just credit nation states and its credit capitalist systems by breaking
[42:15.200 --> 42:20.240]  them down with the lawlessness, with the open borders, with letting violent criminals out,
[42:20.240 --> 42:23.960]  with Democrat states passing laws that you can steal several thousand dollars worth of
[42:23.960 --> 42:28.480]  goods and not get arrested, and then you wonder why shoplifting and crime explodes and everything
[42:28.480 --> 42:30.800]  starts degenerating.
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.560]  This is in the WikiLeaks, Hillary talking to top psychologist at universities how to
[42:36.560 --> 42:38.160]  do this.
[42:38.160 --> 42:45.560]  And then we just have to wake up and say 99.999999% of us are going to be hurt by this, and that
[42:45.560 --> 42:50.640]  nobody should go along with this, and we should say no to the great reset and have our own
[42:50.640 --> 42:55.720]  reset against it, and we've got exclusive footage, some of which never seen, from January
[42:55.720 --> 43:25.560]  6th coming up.
[43:25.560 --> 43:42.480]  So be it, make them silence us by force.
[43:42.480 --> 43:49.640]  This is the final battle of the information war, give now, buy products, donate, before
[43:49.640 --> 43:56.640]  everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end, victory or death, go
[43:56.640 --> 44:00.600]  now to infowarstore.com.
[44:00.600 --> 44:04.600]  God created each and every one of us a free will.
[44:04.600 --> 44:10.520]  When we look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast, everything
[44:10.520 --> 44:15.560]  that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will and making us
[44:15.560 --> 44:21.520]  bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics,
[44:21.520 --> 44:25.760]  our very future over to them.
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.800]  They want control of procreation, they want control of the relationships between men and
[44:29.800 --> 44:36.240]  women, they want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[44:36.240 --> 44:41.920]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image and given free will, and make
[44:41.920 --> 44:47.320]  no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time so
[44:47.320 --> 44:52.360]  that you could make the right decision free will and stand against evil.
[44:52.360 --> 45:02.920]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[45:02.920 --> 45:04.920]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[45:04.920 --> 45:05.920]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[45:05.920 --> 45:06.920]  Good, bro.
[45:06.920 --> 45:07.920]  Great last caller.
[45:07.920 --> 45:11.920]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement, it's basically the only
[45:11.920 --> 45:17.000]  way I get sleep anymore, with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity, it's like
[45:17.000 --> 45:18.680]  we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[45:18.680 --> 45:21.680]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire, Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[45:21.680 --> 45:23.320]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[45:23.320 --> 45:26.360]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the phone of the product.
[45:26.360 --> 45:30.400]  The X2 does wonders, they recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it, get
[45:30.400 --> 45:33.200]  off the fence, get the product, support the info ward.
[45:33.200 --> 45:36.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.560]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor.
[45:38.560 --> 45:39.560]  Honored talk to you.
[45:39.560 --> 45:40.560]  Awesome.
[45:40.560 --> 45:46.160]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29, if
[45:46.160 --> 45:51.000]  you ask my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  for a few of you.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  Well, it definitely works, it's not a joke, you know.
[45:55.000 --> 45:56.000]  Absolutely.
[45:56.000 --> 46:04.080]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are
[46:04.080 --> 46:05.080]  back in stock.
[46:05.080 --> 46:10.560]  Whole food multivitamin, a central nutrient multivitamin from natural healthy sources,
[46:10.560 --> 46:16.040]  not synthetic, and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel
[46:16.040 --> 46:20.400]  Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system in every cell in your body.
[46:20.400 --> 46:26.360]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[46:26.360 --> 46:30.920]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is, this will fund our operation and
[46:30.920 --> 46:31.920]  keep us on air.
[46:31.920 --> 46:39.680]  So, again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin
[46:39.680 --> 46:41.640]  and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[46:41.640 --> 46:45.760]  We also have some great vitamin D products at m4store.com, you need as well, but whatever
[46:45.760 --> 46:50.600]  you do, defend your body's immune system, we want to keep patriots in the game against
[46:50.600 --> 46:51.600]  the new world order.
[46:51.600 --> 46:52.600]  So, it's a 360 win.
[46:52.600 --> 46:56.120]  It's something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.840]  system while funding the info war at infowarstore.com.
[47:00.840 --> 47:21.040]  Bringing a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.040 --> 47:27.000]  One way or another, this globalist system is collapsing and that globalism is designed
[47:27.000 --> 47:33.200]  to collapse regular civilization and on its ashes built its new system, but the very trap
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.760]  they set for us is now ensnared them, but we don't want to be taken down with the new
[47:38.760 --> 47:40.640]  world order.
[47:40.640 --> 47:48.440]  We don't want their collapse to trigger the take down of our civilization and to do that,
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.960]  we've got to cause a giant mass awakening and become aware of the behavioral psychology
[47:53.960 --> 47:55.760]  and the brainwashing going on.
[47:55.760 --> 48:01.600]  Eric Clapton just came out in a big interview that Owen will cover next hour and said they're
[48:01.600 --> 48:06.280]  using subliminal messaging, they're using brainwashing techniques, they're using mass
[48:06.280 --> 48:13.280]  hypnosis and mass psychosis to control, which is true, more and more people are getting
[48:13.280 --> 48:17.160]  this and the system trying to suppress that isn't going to work.
[48:17.160 --> 48:24.080]  So, I'm not looking for conflict with people, I'm looking for peace and justice and to not
[48:24.080 --> 48:26.040]  be a corporate slave of the globalist.
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.480]  Now I won't have time to air this whole video in this 11 minute segment, it's about 11 minutes
[48:30.480 --> 48:37.920]  long, we're already into it, but we'll post this in post to band.video and that's why
[48:37.920 --> 48:42.400]  band.video is so special and this live radio slash TV show is because we've been censored
[48:42.400 --> 48:47.920]  off everything except our own platform, only here can we even show you that I tried to
[48:47.920 --> 48:53.160]  stop what happened on January 6th, but a lot of this footage we went and dug back through
[48:53.160 --> 48:57.200]  our archives and watched it in the last few weeks because we were trying to go back and
[48:57.200 --> 49:01.440]  actually piece everything together so we could have accurately in our minds for any testimony
[49:01.440 --> 49:07.120]  what happened, it's a lot of stuff and we just didn't realize how many times I talked
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.520]  about peace even before it happened and so again here's part of it, then we'll come
[49:12.520 --> 49:17.080]  back next hour with huge news and Owen Schreuer and more, but a lot of this has been seen,
[49:17.080 --> 49:20.640]  a lot of this hasn't been seen and here it is.
[49:20.640 --> 49:25.200]  And after this we're going to walk down and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk
[49:25.200 --> 49:31.680]  down, we're going to walk down anyone you want, but I think right here we're going to
[49:31.680 --> 49:42.200]  walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen
[49:42.200 --> 49:50.120]  and women and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.720]  you'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to
[49:55.720 --> 49:59.080]  be strong.
[49:59.080 --> 50:05.800]  We have come to demand that congress do the right thing and only count the electors who
[50:05.800 --> 50:11.120]  have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.400]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully
[50:16.400 --> 50:21.200]  and patriotically make your voices heard.
[50:21.200 --> 50:26.040]  What's hanging here away from that?
[50:26.040 --> 50:27.040]  Yes sir.
[50:27.040 --> 50:28.040]  Trump said he's going to lead the march.
[50:28.040 --> 50:29.040]  He's coming out this way.
[50:29.040 --> 50:30.040]  I saw his motorcade.
[50:30.040 --> 50:35.760]  So I think his motorcade may lead down the street.
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.680]  Our route I think is going to be based on a recon straight down Pennsylvania and then
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.600]  the Supreme Court side of the Capitol is where people are already gathering and I saw stages,
[50:43.600 --> 50:58.920]  a little one on the left side, real tiny straight up Pennsylvania, face out, bubble.
[50:58.920 --> 51:05.800]  If you want to kind of just organize some people here and just tell them what we're
[51:05.800 --> 51:09.320]  doing they're going to listen to you, we're standing by for Trump.
[51:09.320 --> 51:14.800]  I think based on the blockades and his convoy, it's right here.
[51:14.800 --> 51:15.800]  It converges.
[51:15.800 --> 51:20.120]  I think the red lady where she at, I think she's gone.
[51:20.120 --> 51:23.120]  She knows that they said they're going to do everything she told us to do accurately.
[51:23.120 --> 51:24.120]  So we need to call her real quick.
[51:24.120 --> 51:25.120]  I don't remember what she said.
[51:25.120 --> 51:26.120]  She said why are you going to drive.
[51:26.120 --> 51:27.120]  I think she heard what she was going to march.
[51:27.120 --> 51:28.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the second wave of an evolution against the government.
[51:28.120 --> 51:41.120]  And the time comes and we've got a president ready to fight and he told us to march peacefully
[51:41.120 --> 51:48.120]  to the Capitol and that's what we're going to do.
[51:48.120 --> 51:53.120]  Let's go take our country back, perhaps only minutes away, let's start marching into the
[51:53.120 --> 52:00.120]  Capitol.
[52:00.120 --> 52:09.120]  We're here to take our rightful country back peacefully because we're not globalist anti-fuck
[52:09.120 --> 52:10.120]  criminals.
[52:10.120 --> 52:31.120]  So let's start marching and I salute you all.
[52:31.120 --> 52:43.120]  All right everybody out of the way because I've got to get this crowd off there because
[52:43.120 --> 52:48.120]  we're trying to move back in there so the trip won't come.
[52:48.120 --> 52:57.120]  Easy, watch the tree, watch the people sitting down.
[52:57.120 --> 53:10.120]  Listen to me, listen to me, we've got a permit on the other side, it's great that this happened
[53:10.120 --> 53:13.120]  but the Trump's not going to come when we've taken this over.
[53:13.120 --> 53:18.120]  We're not anti-fuck, we're not neo-nob, you're amazing, I love you.
[53:18.120 --> 53:24.120]  Let's march around the other side and let's not fight the police and give the system what
[53:24.120 --> 53:25.120]  they want.
[53:25.120 --> 53:34.120]  We are peaceful, we won this election and as much as I love seeing the Trump flags flying
[53:34.120 --> 53:41.120]  over this, we need to not have the confrontation with the police, they're going to make that
[53:41.120 --> 53:42.120]  the story.
[53:42.120 --> 53:48.120]  I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy
[53:48.120 --> 53:56.120]  this place, get everybody behind you, march to the other side, march to the other side.
[53:56.120 --> 54:06.120]  You guys are great but the police, the volunteers have caused the problem and the police are
[54:06.120 --> 54:10.120]  coming for the space, we don't want to have a kid state here.
[54:10.120 --> 54:17.120]  So I love you, we're saving the republic, this is beautiful but please tell everyone
[54:17.120 --> 54:19.120]  to march to the other side.
[54:19.120 --> 54:33.120]  We're going to march, Trump is going to speak over here, Trump is going to march to the other
[54:33.120 --> 54:34.120]  side.
[54:34.120 --> 54:57.120]  We've got so many emails and calls and in person people were going to go in, they didn't know
[54:57.120 --> 55:04.120]  that the Capitol was open, we saved them and probably the police too, they've been ongoing
[55:04.120 --> 55:05.120]  fights.
[55:05.120 --> 55:34.120]  We're not stealing the stage like the democrats did, you've got a night job, come down up
[55:34.120 --> 55:48.120]  to the other side of the Capitol, there's about four minutes left, five minutes left, we'll
[55:48.120 --> 55:51.120]  add it in post, we'll add what I just said up to man.video later.
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.120]  A lot of this has not been seen before, some of it has been seen but the issue here is
[55:56.120 --> 56:02.560]  we have to get this on record because I'm being framed, you as Trump supporters and just
[56:02.560 --> 56:08.360]  populist Americans that love this country are being framed as terrorists when 98% of
[56:08.360 --> 56:13.600]  you were totally peaceful that day that we're there and you went there to exercise your
[56:13.600 --> 56:15.280]  sacred First Amendment rights.
[56:15.280 --> 56:19.440]  So I salute you for being there, we're not going to let them frame us or set us up but
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.320]  that's why M4 Wars is so precious because imagine a Band-Aid video wasn't there, millions
[56:24.320 --> 56:29.640]  of views a day, they've shut down almost everything else, that's why it's so exciting to see
[56:29.640 --> 56:36.760]  Parler getting bigger or Parler setting problems, actually a gab and rumble and getter and others
[56:36.760 --> 56:42.440]  that have streaming and videos now and what Mike Adams is doing with Brighton and his
[56:42.440 --> 56:47.480]  live streaming he's doing now and we're trying to launch that for folks on Band-Aid video,
[56:47.480 --> 56:54.000]  we're very close so we just got a lot of things going on but we can't pay for this infrastructure
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.400]  to peacefully wake up America and peacefully counter globalist lies without you.
[56:58.400 --> 57:03.080]  So this is a war, it's an information war and I thank you for your support for myself
[57:03.080 --> 57:07.360]  and yourself and our families but I need you to go to M4WarStore.com, there's only a few
[57:07.360 --> 57:13.640]  days left on Brain Force Plus at 40% off, back at stock, our great new tropic and I'm

[57:40.120 --> 57:43.640]  with your support, we'll stay on air so thank you all for what you do, we'll be right back
[57:43.640 --> 57:45.640]  with Owen Schreuer.
[57:45.640 --> 57:53.200]  Hey Info Warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program
[57:53.200 --> 57:58.160]  and you've fed up with everything going on in the world, inside you, like me, a fire
[57:58.160 --> 58:03.480]  is burning, something needs to change and yet we feel helpless, almost like we're stuck
[58:03.480 --> 58:08.000]  inside a system that someone else created for us, it's time for us to break free from
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.000]  that system.
[58:09.000 --> 58:15.120]  Reset Wars is a game changer, you start to see yourself more as part of the solution
[58:15.120 --> 58:16.760]  instead of just as a victim.
[58:16.760 --> 58:22.120]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy and makes us depressed
[58:22.120 --> 58:24.880]  and therefore we manifest as negative reality out there.
[58:24.880 --> 58:30.560]  When they feel their lie-cheat steel plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an awakening.
[58:30.560 --> 58:37.880]  Reset Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep-rooted psychological
[58:37.880 --> 58:41.560]  tactics that were being used against me and now I'm not scared anymore.
[58:41.560 --> 58:47.120]  I have to say, I was blown away, I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[58:47.120 --> 58:51.400]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together, you're absolutely right.
[58:51.400 --> 58:57.200]  We are reflections of God, we are emanations of that and we can use that God energy to
[58:57.200 --> 58:59.960]  do really anything we want to do in this life.
[58:59.960 --> 59:04.480]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind and
[59:04.480 --> 59:09.320]  that's a process, most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious, most people go through
[59:09.320 --> 59:13.080]  their day and don't think about many things, you can drive along a long journey and not
[59:13.080 --> 59:14.720]  even remember half the trip.
[59:14.720 --> 59:20.440]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[59:20.440 --> 59:25.800]  that subconscious mind, that's what this series is about, is resetting our mind because there's
[59:25.800 --> 59:31.680]  a war on for our mind, he's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation
[59:31.680 --> 59:35.520]  and in this new great awakening and I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there
[59:35.520 --> 59:51.560]  yet, go to resetwars.com, that's where your journey begins.
[59:51.560 --> 1:00:11.760]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:18.480]  Well Brian Stelter and the creeps over at CNN have taken their creepiness to the next
[1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:19.480]  level.
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:24.280]  I could spend an hour on this but I've just got five minutes right now, look at this image
[1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:31.840]  of Brian Stelter man spreading literally for these little kids video, Brian Stelter visits
[1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:38.680]  school kids to teach them misinformation and boy did Twitter have a heyday and others.
[1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:44.000]  This is what misinformation looks like, masks don't work, he's wearing that, he's telling
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.080]  them don't even trust satire, don't trust anything, CNN, CNN has less viewers on record
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:59.120]  than even censored info wars does, Joe Rogan's program now has 20 plus times the viewers on
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:05.000]  average of CNN and that's Joe Rogan, so they could try to censor his shut me down, 10 more
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:10.800]  pop up even bigger, so it's a very crazy time to be alive and look I'm not saying Brian
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:14.480]  Stelter's a pedophile, I've never said that, I've said if I was going to cast somebody
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:18.920]  it's like an evil it the clown goblin that lives in sewers and eats children, it would
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:25.840]  be Brian Stelter, so here they are in New York City, that dungeon of tyranny and here
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:33.680]  comes Brian Stelter crying out of the manhole cover to try to come in and indoctrinate them
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.920]  that you need to only believe me, so they're already used to pay to be in airports but
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:43.480]  people complain so much, CNN can't even pay to be in airports anymore, when I grow up
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:49.920]  in high school CNN paid for TVs in the schools and every second period we had to watch 15
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:53.920]  minutes a day of CNN propaganda, so they said they've always been basically the propaganda
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:59.680]  channel and now that's not enough, now they're coming directly into the schools so he can
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:04.640]  sit there and weirdly spread his legs, I mean who sits on a chair like that that spreads
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:08.600]  their legs, it's like a drag queen story time when they come and spread their legs for
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:15.440]  the kids, it's absolutely disgusting, here's part of the report.
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:21.120]  Barbara King wants to arm this eighth grade class, alright so today's topic is misinformation
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:26.560]  with the tools they will need in a world of information saturation, we're going to learn
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:32.800]  to identify the various types of misinformation and there is a lot to learn, they're called
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:42.840]  satire, false context, imposter content, manipulated content and fabricated content.
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:46.760]  Just imagine trying to make sense of all of this as a teenager.
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:51.160]  Now we go to imposter content, what does imposter mean?
[1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:56.520]  I mean everything they just said there, manipulated content, manufactured content, it just makes
[1:02:56.520 --> 1:03:04.800]  you think of CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN calls us for comments, we give them comments on time
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:11.160]  and they say they do not respond to comment, so just imagine you pay all these property
[1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:15.760]  taxes to send your children to school and then they sit there and can't teach them
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:19.880]  to read and write, the country's going illiterate by design, but you can learn all about how
[1:03:19.880 --> 1:03:23.800]  you're a racist and all about how boys can be girls and girls can be boys and all about
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:28.160]  how boys can be on the girls track team and on the girls swim team and how men can come
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:35.120]  in the bathroom of little girls and in comes Brian Stelter wearing a mask to keep the psychological
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:43.960]  fear going, it's all garbage, it's all theater and the blue cities have turned into literal
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:53.320]  hell holes, it's CNN lied to us about the WMDs, it's CNN that's lied to us on so many fronts
[1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:57.960]  and it helped cover up the murder of people in nursing homes in New York during COVID,
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:03.120]  it's CNN that has blood on its hands and it's CNN that is like a zombie network because
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:08.240]  nobody watches it except people that make fun of it and hate it but still the big money
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:14.600]  of AT&T keeps it propped up and it just won't go away, so that's what you learn in public
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:18.520]  school, a lot of the private schools now is how to take deadly shots, how to tattle on
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:25.400]  your parents, how to wear masks and get carbon dioxide poisoning and how to only trust CNN,
[1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:29.480]  this is truly an establishment and decline, we don't want to fight with it, we want to
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:34.000]  remove ourselves from it and step out of the way as this globalist neoliberal political
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:41.240]  system collapses and politically dies, that's our mission is to survive and thrive and love
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:48.200]  God and build a better human world for all God's children together and that's the mission
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:59.800]  of Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, Owen Schreuer takes over.
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:05.200]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:09.760]  a healthier life, Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your
[1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:15.240]  system with a supplement that contains both, this Infowars life offering vitamin C plus
[1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:20.360]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the Infowars store, the rose hips contained
[1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:26.800]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:31.640]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:36.320]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:41.080]  shown, as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an
[1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:46.200]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:51.320]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:55.920]  like here in America, so next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[1:05:55.920 --> 1:06:13.880]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:26.800]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[1:06:26.800 --> 1:06:32.600]  Ex-head of respiratory research at Pfizer, Mike Yeadon and researchers including Craig
[1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:40.080]  Particooper have sourced Veir's data on vaccine death and injury in the US, a database of
[1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:47.520]  over 700,000 adverse reactions caused by the Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen vaccines.
[1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:53.600]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as LOTS.
[1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:59.760]  This has allowed Yeadon's team to back engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:01.360]  in the US.
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:07.880]  All their information is published at HowBadIsMyBatch.com and HowBad.info.
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:10.520]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:17.280]  About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic, resulting in hospitalization,
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.680]  disability and death within days or weeks of injection.
[1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:27.760]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:32.800]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together
[1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:38.440]  to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches.
[1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:43.920]  While one company is deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating
[1:07:43.920 --> 1:07:50.080]  the scientific environment to perform dose range finding or the maximum tolerated dose
[1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:52.560]  for each specific batch.
[1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:57.760]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:03.480]  quiet period, allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:05.400]  is deployed.
[1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:11.280]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain LOTS
[1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:12.760]  are included.
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:17.720]  The very same LOTS found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:23.720]  Which makes sense, there would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo.
[1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:25.840]  Only the deadly ones.
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:30.560]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:35.360]  specific populations, such as red states.
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:41.040]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:46.160]  overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:52.000]  Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.320]  On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries
[1:08:56.320 --> 1:08:58.160]  than blue states.
[1:08:58.160 --> 1:09:02.480]  After ruling out other possibilities, part of Cooper concluded that this can only be
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:07.480]  due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal batches
[1:09:07.480 --> 1:09:10.600]  than blue states did.
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:15.840]  Among several other crimes, they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:22.600]  people who voted against the New World Order's woke, build-back, better, great reset, while
[1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:28.760]  at the same time endlessly flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners.
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:31.840]  And it's happening right now.
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:51.520]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:58.440]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:03.560]  Jones show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:10.120]  And so there is your Greg Rees report, very startling, on Band-Aid video, almost with
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:12.720]  a million views.
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:22.880]  And you just got to think about what an enemy operation would do in a time of war as a backdrop
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:29.640]  as the frame of context for that video, and it makes even all the more sense as diabolical
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:31.320]  as the notion may be.
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:35.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here's what we have coming up the rest of this transmission.
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.880]  We're going to have a doctor on with us in the next hour discussing the End the Mandates
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:45.200]  rally, the pro-life rally from over the weekend.
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:50.200]  And there is a hearing happening right now with Ron Johnson and others.
[1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:55.280]  Dr. Malone is there, Dr. McCullough is there, Dr. Kirsch is there.
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:10:58.640]  Happening in Washington, D.C., and it's just incredible I've been popping in and out of
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:10:59.640]  this all day.
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:05.440]  It's been going on for about an hour and a half, and it's just unbelievable information.
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:09.480]  I mean, they've completely destroyed all the vaccine narratives.
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.320]  They've completely destroyed all the COVID narratives.
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:13.320]  I mean, it's all there.
[1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:15.680]  Now, this isn't being covered by Fox.
[1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.800]  This isn't obviously going to be covered by all of the New World Order media.
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:23.840]  The Build Back Better Great Reset Biden media is not going to cover this.
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:27.040]  They just want you to think the vaccine is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:28.480]  So they're not going to be covering this.
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.480]  The whole world should be seeing this.
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:32.840]  The whole world should be watching this.
[1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:39.080]  So we may be going in and out of that as well as covering the latest news that I have here
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.720]  on my desk in front of me.
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:52.800]  But it's kind of like what we saw in December and then January and then even some months
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:59.560]  after that, where you had these hearings in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:05.920]  Arizona, and you'd have the election workers go up and say, okay, here's what I saw.
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:11.040]  Yeah, they brought in truckloads of ballots at 2 a.m. and they were all for Biden.
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:14.760]  Yeah, they were triple counting ballots in Atlanta because they knew it would increase
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:19.120]  the margins for Biden since 60% of Atlanta, Fulton County votes for Biden, so they just
[1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:20.400]  quadruple counted them.
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:22.960]  Yeah, I was counting fake ballots.
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:26.880]  I've been a ballot counter for 20 years, and I remember counting fake ballots and pointing
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:30.640]  it out to the poll watchers, the head of them, and saying, hey, these are fake.
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.520]  And they said, well, just count them anyway.
[1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:36.640]  They remember mail-in ballots that weren't creased, meaning they were never mailed.
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:37.800]  There was no crease on them.
[1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:39.240]  So how did you put them in an envelope?
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:40.480]  You didn't.
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:43.360]  They talked about how a lot of them had no signatures.
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:45.160]  Anyway, I'm pontificating here.
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:49.800]  The point is, those hearings actually happened.
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:56.280]  But because the media didn't cover them, they just got to act like it didn't exist.
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:01.840]  And all of the shenanigans that went down to put Biden in the White House, for the most
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:04.240]  part, went uncovered.
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:08.360]  And now you're dealing with the worst president in U.S. history, which even the Democrats
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:11.200]  are admitting is the case now, only a year in.
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:12.200]  So it's that same energy.
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:13.880]  It's that same vibe.
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:18.480]  Here's a hearing with congressmen, official government hearing on the record, doctors,
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:21.640]  telling you the truth about the vaccines, telling you the truth about COVID, the side
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:26.320]  effects, all of it, and the media won't even touch it.
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:30.920]  And so that way, the left and the Democrat Party, the authoritarians, the statists can
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:36.120]  just close their eyes, put their head in the sand, and say, nope, this isn't going on.
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:37.640]  The vaccines aren't hurting people.
[1:13:37.640 --> 1:13:39.020]  The vaccines are great.
[1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:40.520]  Natural immunity doesn't even exist.
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:42.480]  COVID is the worst thing ever.
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:43.480]  Nobody can survive COVID.
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:45.640]  You better get the vaccine.
[1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:46.920]  And of course, it's all being destroyed.
[1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:52.800]  So we're going to come back and go to some of this live, because as far as I could tell,
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:57.440]  the only network that's been covering this today is One American Newsnet, and that's
[1:13:57.440 --> 1:13:58.440]  it.
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:05.720]  This should be broadcast on all media outlets today, and only OAN is doing it.
[1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:06.880]  So I won't be a hypocrite.
[1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:10.640]  We'll come back and we'll play just some of that, and I know that the crew is also going
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:14.960]  to be recording it right now, and they're going to be cutting up some of the highlights
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:19.280]  for that, and we'll play those on the war room coming up that I'm hosting later.
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:23.880]  All of this is possible only with your support at infowarstore.com.
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:29.240]  I've got to tell you, when I have to do double duty or come in and host the Joan Show, I
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:35.360]  am just Jones in, no pun intended, but I am just Jones in for a cup of Wake Up America
[1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:37.200]  coffee from infowarstore.com.
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:39.520]  I've got a fresh mug of it right here.
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:42.920]  We've got a fresh pot in the break room.
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:47.920]  Everybody here loves the Wake Up America Patriot Blend, an easy way to support the Info War

[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:06.960]  That's how you can fund us.
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:12.000]  We are back in stock with the Whole Food Multivitamin and the Vitamin C Plus Zinc.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.760]  We were so thrilled at how quickly these sold out, and then the ratings came in, and we
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:20.160]  loved them, so we just repackaged the branding.
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.360]  Same great supplement that you loved before, just with a new label on it, but still the
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:31.480]  same great ingredients in the Whole Food Multivitamin and the Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips.

[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:26.400]  Domestic Terrorists, the days of independent media are numbered, the government has made
[1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:52.460]  sure
[1:16:52.460 --> 1:17:01.940]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are

[1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:24.180]  They're both back in stock sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[1:17:24.180 --> 1:17:28.740]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is, this will fund our operation and
[1:17:28.740 --> 1:17:29.740]  keep us on air.
[1:17:29.740 --> 1:17:36.660]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food,
[1:17:36.660 --> 1:17:39.940]  multivitamin, and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[1:17:39.940 --> 1:17:43.580]  We also have some great vitamin D products at m4tort.com you can eat as well, but whatever
[1:17:43.580 --> 1:17:48.420]  you do, defend your body's immune system, we want to keep patriots in the game against
[1:17:48.420 --> 1:17:49.420]  the new world order.
[1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:53.660]  So 360 win, get something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and
[1:17:53.660 --> 1:17:57.460]  your immune system while funding the info war at m4tort.com.
[1:17:57.460 --> 1:18:02.860]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply
[1:18:02.860 --> 1:18:04.540]  chain breakdowns.
[1:18:04.540 --> 1:18:08.100]  You've done a great job supporting info wars and supporting your immune system.
[1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:12.300]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset, we can't get these products
[1:18:12.300 --> 1:18:13.300]  in.
[1:18:13.300 --> 1:18:19.980]  They came in, but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential, nutrient,
[1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:24.140]  multivitamin so you absorb it and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic vitamins.
[1:18:24.140 --> 1:18:29.580]  And then of course vitamin C and zinc, this sucker is really full and heavy because it's
[1:18:29.580 --> 1:18:33.820]  a huge dose of vitamin C and zinc and rose hips.
[1:18:33.820 --> 1:18:37.340]  Number one thing you can do for your immune system and your body, it does so much more.
[1:18:37.340 --> 1:18:43.280]  Both of these are now back in stock at m4tort.com for 40% off, I'm going to keep you with that
[1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:47.220]  price until they sell out because of supply chain breakdowns, we've got a limited run
[1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:51.260]  so please take action now and order them at m4tort.com.
[1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:55.060]  But whatever you do, find similar products out there and use them because this is a life
[1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:57.420]  and death situation to be healthy.
[1:18:57.420 --> 1:19:00.260]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:19:00.260 --> 1:19:04.580]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:19:04.580 --> 1:19:10.540]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:19:10.540 --> 1:19:14.220]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:19.180]  So in the future under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[1:19:19.180 --> 1:19:23.380]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[1:19:23.380 --> 1:19:27.020]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:33.340]  That's why everybody should visit m4tort.com, we're carrying a huge new line of berry compliant
[1:19:33.340 --> 1:19:38.620]  made in America products that have 100% reviews and are simply incredible.
[1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:44.700]  It's a 360 win, protect your privacy and shop at InfoWars to support the overall InfoWar
[1:19:44.700 --> 1:19:47.780]  against the globalist, a true 360 win.
[1:19:47.780 --> 1:20:16.980]  Get your Faraday cages at m4warsstore.com, check out the new line, it's amazing.
[1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:33.300]  So I asked the crew, I said, guys, let's find who's ever reporting on the Ron Johnson
[1:20:33.300 --> 1:20:36.940]  hearing today, let's find some stories and they said, oh, and there's barely anybody
[1:20:36.940 --> 1:20:38.740]  talking about it, barely anybody covering it.
[1:20:38.740 --> 1:20:40.900]  So it's like it doesn't even exist.
[1:20:40.900 --> 1:20:43.700]  We were able to find two.
[1:20:43.700 --> 1:20:48.420]  You had one on zero hedge, watch live, Senator Johnson holds star studded COVID-19 second
[1:20:48.420 --> 1:20:56.060]  opinion hearing, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Brett Weinstein, Dr. Jay Bachara, Dr. Ryan
[1:20:56.060 --> 1:21:03.980]  Cole, Harvey Riesch, George Fareed, Pierre Corey, Dr. Urso, Dr. Marlick, Dr. Kiriti, Dr.
[1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:08.740]  Malone, Dr. Wiseman, the list just goes on and on.
[1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:12.700]  We've got another one here from Red Voice Media, COVID-19, a second opinion, Ron Johnson,
[1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:15.220]  moderated panel discussion with experts.
[1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:17.580]  This has been ongoing about two hours now.
[1:21:17.580 --> 1:21:21.820]  I want to go live to the OAN feed, the only network that I've seen actually live covering
[1:21:21.820 --> 1:21:22.820]  it today.
[1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:24.260]  Let's pick up some of that coverage right now.
[1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:30.180]  Ron Johnson, Dr. Robert Malone, Peter McCullough, and so many more talking the truth about vaccines
[1:21:30.180 --> 1:21:33.260]  that the establishment doesn't want you to hear.
[1:21:33.260 --> 1:21:38.980]  And we look in the yellow card system, in the UK, we say the same thing, and we look
[1:21:38.980 --> 1:21:44.660]  in the eudra system, in the EU we do the same thing, we have just fulfilled the Bradford
[1:21:44.660 --> 1:21:52.180]  Hill Tennis of Causality, meaning I am telling you, as an epidemiologist, the vaccines are
[1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:59.260]  causing these fatal and non-fatal events to a large degree, and many of those skilled
[1:21:59.260 --> 1:22:01.060]  around the table, I'm sure, would agree.
[1:22:01.060 --> 1:22:05.980]  Okay, so that transition is perfectly, Kyle, I'm going to actually ask you to give up your
[1:22:05.980 --> 1:22:09.020]  seat for Mr. Tom Renz.
[1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:15.140]  I got contacted by Attorney Tom Renz over the weekend, who represents some whistleblowers
[1:22:15.140 --> 1:22:21.660]  within the Department of Defense, and Tom, you don't have much time at all, okay?
[1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:25.420]  He showed me his data, or he showed me the data that is being extracted from, what is
[1:22:25.420 --> 1:22:27.060]  the name of this database?
[1:22:27.060 --> 1:22:28.060]  DMED.
[1:22:28.060 --> 1:22:29.060]  Pardon?
[1:22:29.060 --> 1:22:30.060]  DMED.
[1:22:30.060 --> 1:22:33.060]  It's the Defense Medical Database.
[1:22:33.060 --> 1:22:36.820]  And I'm going to just kind of cut to the punch line, because we just don't have very much
[1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:38.420]  time at all.
[1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:44.460]  But this data, so these are whistleblowers that have been extracting data out of the Defense
[1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:46.500]  Department database.
[1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:53.420]  They have noticed a very alarming increase in instances of certain conditions compared
[1:22:53.420 --> 1:22:59.620]  to a five-year average, like a 10 times number in some cases.
[1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:05.180]  They also have evidence that, with myocarditis, the data has been doctored already, because
[1:23:05.180 --> 1:23:10.980]  they did a search inquiry in August that showed a certain level of myocarditis.
[1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:16.620]  I think it was like 20 times higher, 28 times higher, something like that.
[1:23:16.620 --> 1:23:22.740]  But now, in January, it's only a couple hundred times, or I mean it's two times higher.
[1:23:22.740 --> 1:23:26.020]  So there appears to be doctoring of the data.
[1:23:26.020 --> 1:23:31.500]  Now, my staff has already sent, this morning, we sent a record preservation letter to the
[1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:35.060]  Department of Defense to try and protect this data.
[1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:39.860]  But Tom, why don't you just quickly, because we have other things I do want to get to here.
[1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:45.500]  Please tell me, apparently one of the whistleblowers is brave enough to come forward and give a
[1:23:45.500 --> 1:23:48.140]  name I would not have allowed you to come to talk to.
[1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:49.140]  Yes, Senator.
[1:23:49.140 --> 1:23:52.180]  So we've got three whistleblowers who have given me permission at this point to share
[1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:59.700]  their name, Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Teresa Long, DOMPH, Dr. Samuel Sigloff, and Lieutenant
[1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:03.580]  Colonel Dr. Peter Chambers, DO and Flight Surgeon.
[1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:07.820]  All three have given me this data, I have declarations from all three.
[1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:10.860]  This data is under penalty, this is under penalty of perjury.
[1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:13.620]  We intend to submit this to the courts.
[1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:21.260]  We have substantial data showing that we saw, for example, miscarriage is increased by
[1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:25.660]  300% over the five-year average, almost.
[1:24:25.660 --> 1:24:31.700]  We saw almost 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average.
[1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:34.860]  Cancer is not being talked about except for by Dr. Ryan Cole.
[1:24:34.860 --> 1:24:40.220]  Thank you, Dr. We saw, this one's amazing, neurological.
[1:24:40.220 --> 1:24:46.180]  So neurological issues which would affect our pilots, over a thousand percent increase,
[1:24:46.180 --> 1:24:47.180]  a thousand.
[1:24:47.180 --> 1:24:50.740]  That's ten times, that's ten times the rate, and obviously that was...
[1:24:50.740 --> 1:24:58.700]  83,000 per year, I'm sorry, 82,000 per year to 863,000 in one year.
[1:24:58.700 --> 1:25:03.780]  Our soldiers are being experimented on, injured, and sometimes possibly killed.
[1:25:03.780 --> 1:25:07.700]  Dr. Corey, thank you so much for your stance on the corruption.
[1:25:07.700 --> 1:25:09.700]  That's precisely what it is.
[1:25:09.700 --> 1:25:16.340]  They know this, and Senator, when these doctors are attacked, not necessarily the people in
[1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:19.100]  this room, I'm not given names, they call me.
[1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:23.220]  I'm the one dealing with the medical boards, I'm the one watching the witch hunts, I'm
[1:25:23.220 --> 1:25:26.020]  the one fighting them off, and I'm the one telling them where to go, I'm going to keep
[1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:27.020]  doing that.
[1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:29.820]  Senator, we also have...
[1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:34.740]  Let me give you this last thing, and then I'll shut up and get out of your way.
[1:25:34.740 --> 1:25:39.660]  928, 2021, Project Salis Weekly Report.
[1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:46.220]  Project Salis is a defense department initiative where they report and they take all this data
[1:25:46.220 --> 1:25:50.220]  that doesn't exist, supposedly, and they give it to the CDC.
[1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:52.380]  They're watching these vaccines.
[1:25:52.380 --> 1:25:56.500]  On that date, and around that date, I have numerous instances where Fauci and that entire
[1:25:56.500 --> 1:26:02.020]  crew were saying, it's a crisis of unvaxxed, it's 99% unvaxxed in the hospital.
[1:26:02.020 --> 1:26:09.100]  In Project Salis, in the Weekly Report, the DOD document says, specifically, 71% of new
[1:26:09.100 --> 1:26:14.380]  cases are in the fully vaxxed, and 60% of hospitalizations are in the fully vaxxed.
[1:26:14.380 --> 1:26:16.500]  This is corruption at the highest level.
[1:26:16.500 --> 1:26:18.180]  We need investigations.
[1:26:18.180 --> 1:26:20.700]  The Secretary of Defense needs investigated.
[1:26:20.700 --> 1:26:23.140]  The CDC needs investigated.
[1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:27.460]  And thank you so much, Senator, for having the courage to stand against these special
[1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:28.460]  interests.
[1:26:28.460 --> 1:26:29.460]  Yes, yes.
[1:26:29.460 --> 1:26:31.780]  Seriously, I was just saying that in the break.
[1:26:31.780 --> 1:26:33.460]  Thank God for Ron Johnson.
[1:26:33.460 --> 1:26:34.820]  We need to pray for Ron Johnson.
[1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:40.420]  We need to pray God's hedge of protection over Ron Johnson, and these great doctors and
[1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:41.420]  whistleblowers.
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:42.420]  Here's Ron Johnson.
[1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:48.020]  They must preserve these records, and this must be investigated, okay?
[1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:49.020]  Absolutely.
[1:26:49.020 --> 1:26:51.500]  Thank you so much, Senator.
[1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:52.500]  Thank you.
[1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:58.020]  So, the increase in cancer is something I've been hearing about for months.
[1:26:58.020 --> 1:27:01.660]  And quite honestly, I've told people, they're reporting this to me.
[1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:04.420]  I don't think the public's quite ready for that yet, okay?
[1:27:04.420 --> 1:27:05.900]  But you've just raised this issue.
[1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:07.900]  Apparently, Dr. Cole, you're aware of this.
[1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:09.260]  Can you talk a little bit about that?
[1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:12.340]  Because this is frightening.
[1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:13.340]  Thank you, Senator.
[1:27:13.340 --> 1:27:17.020]  And this is a challenge in terms of aggregating data.
[1:27:17.020 --> 1:27:22.740]  I saw a signal early on of certain viral conditions, Dr. Parks pointed out mechanisms.
[1:27:22.740 --> 1:27:24.660]  I noticed certain viruses increasing.
[1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:29.540]  Well, these same T cells, immune cells, keep cancers in check.
[1:27:29.540 --> 1:27:32.300]  So I do about 40,000 biopsies a year.
[1:27:32.300 --> 1:27:36.500]  I'm a busy pathologist, and I thought, gosh, I'm seeing more of this type of cancer and
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:39.140]  this type of cancer and this type of cancer.
[1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:44.660]  And so I've tried to talk to other laboratories and aggregate a bigger data set, which obviously
[1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:48.300]  these federal data sets are a very easy way to see that signal.
[1:27:48.300 --> 1:27:53.460]  Obviously, I've been canceled, I've been ridiculed, I've been maligned, et cetera,
[1:27:53.460 --> 1:27:56.860]  for saying so, but I've been observing it.
[1:27:56.860 --> 1:27:58.300]  And I can't deny observation.
[1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:00.820]  That's how science happens, initially, through observation.
[1:28:00.820 --> 1:28:04.540]  Then we confirm through hypothesis, experiment, and data.
[1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:06.300]  So yes, we're seeing it.
[1:28:06.300 --> 1:28:10.700]  And now, when we travel with these groups and summits, I have oncologists, I have radiation
[1:28:10.700 --> 1:28:15.140]  oncologists, I am seeing an uptick in cancers, I'm seeing these odd, stable cancers take
[1:28:15.140 --> 1:28:18.580]  off like wildfires after the vaccines.
[1:28:18.580 --> 1:28:20.140]  It is happening.
[1:28:20.140 --> 1:28:22.020]  We need federal funding.
[1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:26.060]  The NIH isn't looking at this, getting a grant to look at anything related to the vaccines
[1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:28.060]  is next to impossible because they're perfectly effective.
[1:28:28.060 --> 1:28:29.060]  All right.
[1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:30.580]  That's Dr. Ryan Cole talking now, folks.
[1:28:30.580 --> 1:28:31.580]  This is incredible.
[1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:32.580]  This is like...
[1:28:32.580 --> 1:28:33.740]  My eye is anecdotal.
[1:28:33.740 --> 1:28:34.740]  My observation...
[1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:35.740]  This is like the prelims.
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:37.500]  Go ahead and pull it down.
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:43.260]  This is like the prelims or the warm-up opening ceremony to Nuremberg 2.0.
[1:28:43.260 --> 1:28:46.300]  I mean, are you hearing what these doctors are saying?
[1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:50.980]  They're seeing a radical increase in cancer post-vaccination, and they know why.
[1:28:50.980 --> 1:28:55.420]  They're telling you the science, how it's destroying the cells that attack cancer.
[1:28:55.420 --> 1:28:58.140]  We'll be right back with more.
[1:28:58.140 --> 1:29:01.700]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill.
[1:29:01.700 --> 1:29:05.300]  And it is the fastest-growing market in supplements in the world.
[1:29:05.300 --> 1:29:07.420]  For a good reason.
[1:29:07.420 --> 1:29:12.920]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible
[1:29:12.920 --> 1:29:14.700]  things in our brains.
[1:29:14.700 --> 1:29:15.860]  And we've tried them all.
[1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:17.100]  We've researched them all.
[1:29:17.100 --> 1:29:22.580]  And we will not sell you anything that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity
[1:29:22.580 --> 1:29:24.140]  or any type of extreme hangovers.
[1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:27.540]  I mean, because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit
[1:29:27.540 --> 1:29:29.620]  of a letdown once you take them, but that would just be a lie.
[1:29:29.620 --> 1:29:33.940]  But these are very, very clean of compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:39.380]  And one of our bestsellers is back in stock, BrainForce Plus, a good, clean, Neutropic,

[1:29:41.420 --> 1:29:43.460]  You can find stuff that's stronger, but it's not good for you.
[1:29:43.460 --> 1:29:45.460]  This is a high-quality system.
[1:29:45.460 --> 1:29:47.460]  It's available at infoworshore.com.
[1:29:47.460 --> 1:29:50.300]  It's sold out for a long time at 40% off.

[1:29:54.300 --> 1:29:58.060]  Thank you so much, and I'll see you out there.
[1:29:58.060 --> 1:30:03.460]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:30:03.460 --> 1:30:05.500]  a healthier life.
[1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:09.340]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[1:30:09.340 --> 1:30:10.980]  that contains both.
[1:30:10.980 --> 1:30:15.940]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[1:30:15.940 --> 1:30:17.540]  from the InfoWars store.
[1:30:17.540 --> 1:30:22.380]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:30:22.380 --> 1:30:25.100]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:30:25.100 --> 1:30:29.900]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:30:29.900 --> 1:30:34.620]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:30:34.620 --> 1:30:35.620]  shown.
[1:30:35.620 --> 1:30:39.900]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:44.500]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:30:44.500 --> 1:30:49.580]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:30:49.580 --> 1:30:50.580]  like here in America.
[1:30:50.580 --> 1:30:55.420]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infoworshore.com where we promise
[1:30:55.420 --> 1:30:57.500]  our rose hips don't lie.
[1:30:57.500 --> 1:31:04.380]  In late August InfoWars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands that
[1:31:04.380 --> 1:31:10.620]  the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:13.740]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:31:13.740 --> 1:31:16.780]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that is important to
[1:31:16.780 --> 1:31:17.780]  have.
[1:31:17.780 --> 1:31:20.900]  It is a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[1:31:20.900 --> 1:31:24.780]  filtration, self defense, and a relationship with God.
[1:31:24.780 --> 1:31:28.140]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in.
[1:31:28.140 --> 1:31:31.580]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:31:31.580 --> 1:31:32.580]  It's high quality.
[1:31:32.580 --> 1:31:37.300]  It's very, very low cost at infoworshore.com because in the future you're going to see
[1:31:37.300 --> 1:31:41.620]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[1:31:41.620 --> 1:31:42.940]  already taking place.
[1:31:42.940 --> 1:31:49.220]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infoworshore.com.
[1:31:49.220 --> 1:31:53.860]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[1:31:53.860 --> 1:31:56.340]  You'll get prepared now at infoworshore.com.
[1:32:23.860 --> 1:32:32.660]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[1:32:32.660 --> 1:32:39.620]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[1:32:39.620 --> 1:32:42.980]  only I own profitable.
[1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:44.980]  You will then be my slaves.
[1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:51.580]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot of rhythm from Cobra who will remove your
[1:32:51.580 --> 1:32:58.700]  immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:15.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:19.140]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:33:19.140 --> 1:33:24.620]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:24.620 --> 1:33:28.500]  You know something strange is happening here and of course you're tuned in because you
[1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:29.740]  know what's going on.
[1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:35.740]  We know what's going on, but to new audience members or just the general population that's
[1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:40.220]  confused at all of this, not really sure what's going on, maybe starting to wake up.
[1:33:40.220 --> 1:33:45.160]  Yeah, we've got this hearing with Senator Ron Johnson and dozens of doctors.
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:48.860]  By the way, we're going to be joined by one of the doctors that's on the panel and about
[1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:49.860]  half an hour.
[1:33:49.860 --> 1:33:53.700]  Dr. Marble is going to be joining us live on the air to discuss this, but yeah, we've
[1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:58.180]  got this panel of doctors and a senator, very little media.
[1:33:58.180 --> 1:34:03.980]  They're reporting on it and covering it, talking about their clinical data, their government
[1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:09.980]  data and just their general experience since COVID in the vaccines, in the deadliness,
[1:34:09.980 --> 1:34:11.740]  all the lies, all the coverups, all of it.
[1:34:11.740 --> 1:34:12.740]  It's really powerful.
[1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:17.580]  We're going to go back, but you have to ask yourself, what is going on here?
[1:34:17.580 --> 1:34:21.700]  Pfizer CEO says annual COVID jabs would be an ideal situation.
[1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:24.100]  Oh, he'd like that, wouldn't he?
[1:34:24.100 --> 1:34:28.460]  To see his profits continue to skyrocket, Fauci coming out and saying the same thing.
[1:34:28.460 --> 1:34:31.260]  We need unlimited boosters.
[1:34:31.260 --> 1:34:35.140]  What do vaccinated and unvaccinated people have in common?
[1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:39.540]  They will never be fully vaccinated.
[1:34:39.540 --> 1:34:41.020]  So what is going on?
[1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:44.740]  If these people actually cared about your health, if these people were actually trying to do
[1:34:44.740 --> 1:34:48.100]  this for good reasons, they'd come out and they'd be honest about this.
[1:34:48.100 --> 1:34:50.940]  They wouldn't try to scuttle the information from getting out.
[1:34:50.940 --> 1:34:53.580]  They would be censoring people that are questioning it.
[1:34:53.580 --> 1:34:58.700]  They wouldn't be hiding their own data for decades into the future.
[1:34:58.700 --> 1:35:02.860]  They wouldn't be attacking doctors and members of the media that question the vaccines.
[1:35:02.860 --> 1:35:06.300]  And when they see all the side effects that have been mentioned at this hearing, they
[1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:10.620]  would back off and they'd say, hey, you know what, something's going on here.
[1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:12.180]  We know a lot more about COVID.
[1:35:12.180 --> 1:35:14.380]  You're probably going to be fine without the vaccine.
[1:35:14.380 --> 1:35:15.380]  Let's step back.
[1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:16.380]  Let's stop mandating these.
[1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:19.780]  Let's stop forcing these until we have a little bit of better idea about what's going to be
[1:35:19.780 --> 1:35:23.860]  the long-term side effects of this experimental technology, mRNA technology.
[1:35:23.860 --> 1:35:30.460]  But no, they say full steam ahead, vaccinate everyone 100 times, damn the side effects,
[1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:33.780]  damn the death, damn your freedom.
[1:35:33.780 --> 1:35:37.580]  So you got to just scratch your head and say, wow, what is wrong with these people?
[1:35:37.580 --> 1:35:39.540]  What is going on here?
[1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:47.700]  So we go back now to the panel, Senator Ron Johnson, and just a bevy of heroic doctors
[1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:49.220]  reporting here.
[1:35:49.220 --> 1:35:50.940]  The media will ignore it.
[1:35:50.940 --> 1:35:51.940]  We won't.
[1:35:51.940 --> 1:35:56.140]  In fact, we'll probably upload the whole hearing to Band-Aid video at some point, if not today
[1:35:56.140 --> 1:35:57.260]  tomorrow.
[1:35:57.260 --> 1:36:01.500]  But here it is, the doctors, whistleblowers, and everybody warning the world, trying to
[1:36:01.500 --> 1:36:04.420]  get the truth out about these vaccines and COVID.
[1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:09.520]  The experimental data on the genome in P53 in BRCA, can you explain that to everyone
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  here?
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:11.520]  Yeah, real quick.
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:12.520]  So we have genes in our body.
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:14.340]  We have mechanisms in our body.
[1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:16.300]  We have bad cells in our body every day.
[1:36:16.300 --> 1:36:22.060]  Our body says, oh, I can kill that, knock it off, you know, shake hands with every cells,
[1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:24.620]  you're gone, you're gone, you're a bad cell.
[1:36:24.620 --> 1:36:29.900]  There are genes, there are suppressor genes, P53, it's the guardian of our genome.
[1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:32.180]  There's another breast cancer gene, BRCA gene.
[1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:39.980]  We know that the spike protein binds to the receptors for these genes and can activate
[1:36:39.980 --> 1:36:40.980]  them.
[1:36:40.980 --> 1:36:43.700]  That is a mechanism of the spike protein.
[1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:51.980]  So putting this spike protein in the human body via a gene shot that is completely investigational,
[1:36:51.980 --> 1:36:57.860]  these are not approved, and to mandate something that's investigational that can bind to cancer-promoting
[1:36:57.860 --> 1:36:58.860]  sites.
[1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:04.940]  I'd like to just clarify and take that a step forward, because what P53 does is it checks
[1:37:04.940 --> 1:37:09.380]  your DNA before it replicates, and it makes sure that it's fixed.
[1:37:09.380 --> 1:37:16.060]  So P53 is the one tumor suppressor gene that is most tied to cancer, because once there's
[1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:22.660]  a mutation in P53, the mutation rate just skyrockets, and you're going to develop enough mutations
[1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:26.740]  that that cancer is going to have a much more likelihood of becoming metastatic.
[1:37:26.740 --> 1:37:27.740]  Absolutely.
[1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:30.140]  P53 is the essential tumor suppressor.
[1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:35.140]  Now, do we know for sure that the spike protein is binding it and inactivating it so that
[1:37:35.140 --> 1:37:42.500]  it cannot make sure that your DNA is replicated effectively and without any errors?
[1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:48.260]  No, but that's why we should have tested these for cancer-causing potential before we started
[1:37:48.260 --> 1:37:49.540]  giving them to our kids.
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:51.380]  There's some confirmatory and silicone studies.
[1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:53.020]  Can I put it into the record?
[1:37:53.020 --> 1:37:54.020]  Yes.
[1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:58.140]  It's always young in May where it goes into this data.
[1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:02.060]  SARS-CoV-2 spike compares DNA damage repair.
[1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:03.060]  Thank you.
[1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:07.780]  One of the key points here is we still don't officially know what the structure of these
[1:38:07.780 --> 1:38:10.100]  so-called vaccines are.
[1:38:10.100 --> 1:38:16.260]  We do have some information now that's been published by a Nobel Laureate group from Stanford
[1:38:16.260 --> 1:38:22.260]  looking at the sequence from discards and comparing it with the pans.
[1:38:22.260 --> 1:38:24.380]  And there are what are called untranslated regions.
[1:38:24.380 --> 1:38:27.900]  Has anyone ever heard of this word, untranslated region?
[1:38:27.900 --> 1:38:28.900]  Anyone?
[1:38:28.900 --> 1:38:29.900]  Yes.
[1:38:29.900 --> 1:38:30.900]  A few people.
[1:38:30.900 --> 1:38:31.900]  Okay.
[1:38:31.900 --> 1:38:36.260]  Everyone has been told that the RNA in there is just RNA that's making this spike protein
[1:38:36.260 --> 1:38:38.980]  that's going to make your nice little cute little vaccine just like those mumps and
[1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:41.900]  polio vaccines that we've all had as children.
[1:38:41.900 --> 1:38:43.060]  No, wrong.
[1:38:43.060 --> 1:38:44.860]  There are untranslated regions.
[1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:47.300]  And I'm going to read you what they are.
[1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:51.780]  There are three human gene sequences in those untranslated regions.
[1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:56.140]  One of them, we think, I'm working with a group of molecular biologists and genomics.
[1:38:56.140 --> 1:38:58.540]  One of them, we think, is targeting the mitochondria.
[1:38:58.540 --> 1:39:00.620]  I'll tell you what that gene sequence is.
[1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:07.580]  It is a, whereas it, the three prime untranslated region comprises two sequence elements derived
[1:39:07.580 --> 1:39:14.300]  from the immunoterminal enhancer split, ASMRNA, and the mitochondrial-encoded torbis ribosomal
[1:39:14.300 --> 1:39:18.500]  RNA to confirm RNA stability and high total protein expression.
[1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:21.460]  That's what a WHO document says.
[1:39:21.460 --> 1:39:25.780]  Now, if that's true, if that's true, that, that could mean, we don't know, we need to
[1:39:25.780 --> 1:39:30.820]  find out, that could mean that the expression of the spike protein is actually being expressed
[1:39:30.820 --> 1:39:34.380]  partly at least in ribosomal, in mitochondria ribosomal.
[1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:35.380]  This is so wrong.
[1:39:35.380 --> 1:39:37.380]  Right, right, mitochondria ribosomal.
[1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:38.380]  No, no, no.
[1:39:38.380 --> 1:39:39.380]  Yeah.
[1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:40.380]  That means, that means it could be a kamikaze.
[1:39:40.380 --> 1:39:41.380]  There's a lot of expression.
[1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:44.860]  You know, Dr. Wiseman, listen, you're certainly letting us know you're qualified, but I don't
[1:39:44.860 --> 1:39:45.860]  know what you're talking about.
[1:39:45.860 --> 1:39:46.860]  But, but.
[1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:50.060]  Well, what I'm talking about, Senator, is, what I'm talking about, Senator, is in every
[1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:55.060]  single drug in packaging, insert, you see a chemical structure, don't do you not?
[1:39:55.060 --> 1:39:56.460]  There is a chemical structure.
[1:39:56.460 --> 1:40:01.220]  We need to know the exact chemical structure, the exact sequence of the RNAs and the DNAs
[1:40:01.220 --> 1:40:02.220]  in these vaccines.
[1:40:02.220 --> 1:40:03.220]  Right.
[1:40:03.220 --> 1:40:04.220]  They are being withheld from us.
[1:40:04.220 --> 1:40:07.180]  FDA needs to show us what those structures are.
[1:40:07.180 --> 1:40:10.140]  Need to explain what the pseudo-uridine is doing.
[1:40:10.140 --> 1:40:19.820]  They need to explain this paper from Sahin, who is the founder of BioNTech in 2019, two
[1:40:19.820 --> 1:40:21.420]  years ago, excuse me, 2014.
[1:40:21.420 --> 1:40:24.020]  They talk about non-natural nucleosides.
[1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:26.060]  What are those non-natural nucleosides doing?
[1:40:26.060 --> 1:40:29.180]  He talks about the toxicity of them, the pseudo-uridine.
[1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:30.940]  None of that is being discussed.
[1:40:30.940 --> 1:40:31.940]  None of that.
[1:40:31.940 --> 1:40:33.420]  So I want to clarify a little bit there.
[1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:34.420]  I agree with you.
[1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:35.420]  We need a lot more information.
[1:40:35.420 --> 1:40:40.100]  I want to clarify, because people have said, this is our mRNA vaccines, mRNA only always
[1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:42.580]  goes to protein and we can't do anything.
[1:40:42.580 --> 1:40:44.660]  First we know that people have reverse transcriptase.
[1:40:44.660 --> 1:40:45.660]  Yes, it can make DNA.
[1:40:45.660 --> 1:40:47.380]  Yes, it can go back into the DNA.
[1:40:47.380 --> 1:40:49.420]  But there's something else about RNA.
[1:40:49.420 --> 1:40:51.900]  It can make little hairpin loops.
[1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:54.780]  RNA can regulate your DNA.
[1:40:54.780 --> 1:41:00.900]  So when you put an mRNA vaccine or RNA into your body, it can get in and it can be alternately
[1:41:00.900 --> 1:41:05.820]  spliced, confined to your DNA, and it can regulate it for positive or for negative.
[1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:10.420]  It can change your gene expression and there's stuff in there that can do that either intentionally
[1:41:10.420 --> 1:41:12.180]  or unintentionally.
[1:41:12.180 --> 1:41:13.180]  And we don't know.
[1:41:13.180 --> 1:41:18.180]  It's completely unethical because we have just been trying to understand the RNA.
[1:41:18.180 --> 1:41:20.540]  Because if you're hearing this, guys pull it down real quick.
[1:41:20.540 --> 1:41:23.860]  If you're hearing this, you probably said, hey, we heard a lot about this on Info Wars
[1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:28.860]  a year ago, two years ago, folks, this is like death by a thousand cuts.
[1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:32.840]  If you come up to me and you cut me one time somewhere, I'm probably going to be just fine.
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:36.460]  You cut me 10 times, 100 times, I'm probably going to bleed out.
[1:41:36.460 --> 1:41:41.220]  That's basically what they're saying is going on with this mRNA technology is it's like
[1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:45.580]  death by 100 cuts just constantly attacking your DNA, attacking your DNA.
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:47.860]  That's why they keep pushing these boosters.
[1:41:47.860 --> 1:41:51.700]  I guess either they think keep getting boosted will really work or they just really want
[1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:55.900]  to completely destroy your immune system, want to completely destroy your DNA.
[1:41:55.900 --> 1:41:59.020]  That's what these that's why this doctor here is so fired up about this because he knows
[1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:00.020]  what's going on.
[1:42:00.020 --> 1:42:03.260]  Dr. Peter McCullough talking now cause myocarditis.
[1:42:03.260 --> 1:42:08.080]  The FDA indicates for Pfizer, Moderna that they cause myocarditis.
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:13.740]  We now have over 200 papers in the peer reviewed literature on myocarditis, sadly showing the
[1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:19.100]  rates of myocarditis are far in excess of what the CDC ever imagined.
[1:42:19.100 --> 1:42:24.260]  We've identified that boys are have a predilection for this far more than girls.
[1:42:24.260 --> 1:42:29.020]  The maximum age group, the peak age group is age 18 to 18 to 24.
[1:42:29.020 --> 1:42:30.620]  So it's actually the college age.
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:34.020]  The risk extends up to age 50.
[1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:41.060]  And I can tell you that in this age group, it is clear the risks of the vaccines are
[1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:46.460]  far greater than the risks of COVID-19, the respiratory illness, that's everything right
[1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:47.460]  there.
[1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:49.500]  That is everything right there from Dr. McCullough.
[1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:53.980]  The risk of the vaccine is worse than the risk of COVID bingo.
[1:42:53.980 --> 1:42:55.740]  We'll be right back with more.
[1:42:55.740 --> 1:43:02.500]  Well, here we are in the year 2022 and info wars is now more important than it's ever
[1:43:02.500 --> 1:43:03.500]  been.
[1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:04.500]  We are truly in the zeitgeist.
[1:43:04.500 --> 1:43:07.780]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air and I want to encourage you to take
[1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:13.860]  advantage of a true win-win situation or a 360 win as I've called it at info wars.com.
[1:43:13.860 --> 1:43:18.100]  Get high quality supplements that make your body healthier, make you happier, and then
[1:43:18.100 --> 1:43:22.300]  defend your body with your immune system against outside attackers.
[1:43:22.300 --> 1:43:26.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, multivitamins are the way to go, but so many of them are synthetic.
[1:43:26.340 --> 1:43:31.020]  Our multivitamin whole food system is one of the best quality multivitamin systems you're
[1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:32.020]  going to find.
[1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:34.860]  But regardless of whether you get it from us or somebody else, research and it's a whole
[1:43:34.860 --> 1:43:41.180]  food multivitamin and get it for you and your family, especially old folks, children, everybody
[1:43:41.180 --> 1:43:42.940]  needs it, especially old folks.
[1:43:42.940 --> 1:43:46.780]  Also, we have vitamin C and zinc with rose hips.
[1:43:46.780 --> 1:43:48.260]  It's also back in stock.
[1:43:48.260 --> 1:43:50.100]  It's at 40% off.
[1:43:50.100 --> 1:43:54.820]  Both these are available at info wars.com and brain force plus is back in stock as well
[1:43:54.820 --> 1:43:55.820]  at 40% off.
[1:43:55.820 --> 1:44:03.020]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:44:03.020 --> 1:44:07.580]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:13.140]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator, and we are powerful and
[1:44:13.140 --> 1:44:16.340]  the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:44:16.340 --> 1:44:20.180]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:44:20.180 --> 1:44:23.980]  with the boy, is it true?
[1:44:23.980 --> 1:44:29.820]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:44:29.820 --> 1:44:33.580]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:40.260]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:44:40.260 --> 1:44:42.060]  of this world who is a loser.
[1:44:42.060 --> 1:44:46.460]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:50.420]  because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[1:44:50.420 --> 1:44:55.220]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[1:44:55.220 --> 1:45:05.220]  just announced.
[1:45:05.220 --> 1:45:09.180]  William of California, people are asleep and program controlled.
[1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:10.180]  I agree.
[1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:11.180]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[1:45:11.180 --> 1:45:12.180]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[1:45:12.180 --> 1:45:13.180]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:45:13.180 --> 1:45:14.180]  Can I plug, uh, Alex real quick?
[1:45:14.180 --> 1:45:15.180]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:45:15.180 --> 1:45:21.700]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of twenty five thirty year olds and I worked
[1:45:21.700 --> 1:45:25.300]  them into the ground and you wanted to know why and I've tested this and I've taken your
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:29.420]  B12 and let me tell you when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[1:45:29.420 --> 1:45:30.420]  I really do.
[1:45:30.420 --> 1:45:33.460]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[1:45:33.460 --> 1:45:34.700]  I can run 10 miles.
[1:45:34.700 --> 1:45:39.780]  I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will attest to the
[1:45:39.780 --> 1:45:46.060]  fact that yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing seventy, I'm not just blowing
[1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:56.460]  smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[1:45:56.460 --> 1:46:03.260]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:46:03.260 --> 1:46:09.620]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:46:09.620 --> 1:46:12.740]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:16.180]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has always been something that's important to
[1:46:16.180 --> 1:46:17.180]  have.
[1:46:17.180 --> 1:46:21.500]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have taken care of right along with water filtration,
[1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:23.780]  self defense and a relationship with God.
[1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:27.420]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in now.
[1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:30.580]  We're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:46:30.580 --> 1:46:31.580]  It's high quality.
[1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:36.300]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[1:46:36.300 --> 1:46:40.620]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:41.940]  already taking place.
[1:46:41.940 --> 1:46:48.220]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:52.100]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self sufficient and not under their
[1:46:52.100 --> 1:46:53.100]  control.
[1:46:53.100 --> 1:46:58.420]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:58.420 --> 1:47:21.140]  We've got a lot of other developing news here that I'm going to cover today.
[1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:25.020]  If I don't get to it on the Alex Jones show, I'll get to it on the war room, including
[1:47:25.020 --> 1:47:31.860]  the developments in Russia and Ukraine and Biden or the Biden administration trying to
[1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:35.020]  get involved there, the latest developments there.
[1:47:35.020 --> 1:47:39.620]  There's a bunch of other news developments we need to cover, but we are prioritizing
[1:47:39.620 --> 1:47:45.940]  the hearing right now being held by Senator Ron Johnson with dozens of elite doctors calling
[1:47:45.940 --> 1:47:48.420]  it the second opinion hearing.
[1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:50.140]  And they're telling the truth about the vaccines.
[1:47:50.140 --> 1:47:51.660]  They're telling the truth about COVID.
[1:47:51.660 --> 1:47:54.740]  And so that's why the mainstream media wants nothing to do with it.
[1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:58.460]  So we have to amplify this hearing to the best of our ability.
[1:47:58.460 --> 1:48:04.740]  So we go back now live to the hearing with Senator Ron Johnson and dozens of elite doctors,
[1:48:04.740 --> 1:48:07.460]  the second opinion on COVID and vaccines hearing.
[1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:12.500]  This is what we get when I investigate.
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.140]  This isn't to do this.
[1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:18.780]  This is after a couple of years trying to get information out of another agency and we
[1:48:18.780 --> 1:48:22.380]  finally get the information and it's all redacted.
[1:48:22.380 --> 1:48:28.260]  This is how the federal government, the agency is complied with congressional oversight.
[1:48:28.260 --> 1:48:32.980]  We're glad to share with you, Senator, because we have quite a bit of those that aren't blanked
[1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:33.980]  out.
[1:48:33.980 --> 1:48:39.260]  And we also want to tell you, listen, the side effects, the only one that they're recognizing,
[1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:40.260]  that's an outright lie.
[1:48:40.260 --> 1:48:41.940]  I've got the Pfizer documents.
[1:48:41.940 --> 1:48:45.820]  Pfizer said in their FOIA documents that they released, they said, we're looking for these
[1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:46.820]  side effects.
[1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:50.220]  The FDA said we're looking for these documents.
[1:48:50.220 --> 1:48:52.740]  We've got their documents showing what they're looking for.
[1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:57.060]  They're not sharing it with the American people because they're covering this up.
[1:48:57.060 --> 1:49:00.220]  Corruption was the word of the day and I think it needs to be reiterated.
[1:49:00.220 --> 1:49:04.340]  So somebody really quickly in the testimony talked about what the drug crimes were supposed
[1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:06.620]  to turn over when they made application.
[1:49:06.620 --> 1:49:11.580]  Dr. Cary, talk about that specifically.
[1:49:11.580 --> 1:49:17.860]  So on the day in which the Pfizer vaccine was authorized under federal regulatory law,
[1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:20.260]  that data had to be made public to the American people.
[1:49:20.260 --> 1:49:28.980]  By data, I mean the clinical trials data that Pfizer submits to the FDA, that the FDA then
[1:49:28.980 --> 1:49:31.780]  reviews and decides whether or not we're going to give.
[1:49:31.780 --> 1:49:34.860]  And why wasn't it?
[1:49:34.860 --> 1:49:36.580]  Was there a waiver granted by FDA?
[1:49:36.580 --> 1:49:37.580]  No.
[1:49:37.580 --> 1:49:44.180]  What they said was, you know, we have a lot of FOIA requests and they didn't deny that
[1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:48.260]  they had to release it eventually because that would have obviously contradicted federal
[1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:49.260]  loss.
[1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:53.860]  What they said instead was like, you know, even though we have a budget of $6 billion,
[1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:59.580]  I think it is, you know, we only have a handful of employees to handle these FOIA requests
[1:49:59.580 --> 1:50:03.460]  and, you know, they have to make a lot of photocopies of these documents.
[1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:11.060]  Now a judge has ordered the release, not at 500 pages, we'll get that sooner.
[1:50:11.060 --> 1:50:16.940]  Again, we're running out of time, I did want to talk about some of the other revelations.
[1:50:16.940 --> 1:50:18.140]  You mentioned FOIA.
[1:50:18.140 --> 1:50:23.380]  The FOIA for Japanese regulators showed that this vaccine is not staying in the muscle,
[1:50:23.380 --> 1:50:26.380]  as we were kind of all led to believe that it was the same animal story.
[1:50:26.380 --> 1:50:27.380]  Boy, that's going to be interesting, guys.
[1:50:27.380 --> 1:50:29.420]  Just go down real quick.
[1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.780]  There now, we'll see, I would imagine that there's going to be back and forth here, but
[1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:36.900]  as of today, you just heard it in eight months, and maybe down to seven now, I'm not sure
[1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:39.220]  when the ruling was made, but let's say eight months from now.
[1:50:39.220 --> 1:50:47.340]  So we'll say September, we're supposed to get all of the unredacted documents on the
[1:50:47.340 --> 1:50:55.460]  vaccine side effects in September of this year, right before the midterms, wow.
[1:50:55.460 --> 1:51:03.260]  Think about the political impact that that meteor of information is going to have on
[1:51:03.260 --> 1:51:05.300]  the political landscape.
[1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:08.780]  That is major incoming right there.
[1:51:08.780 --> 1:51:10.700]  Let's go back live to the hearing.
[1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:13.700]  So they were going to use lipid nanoparticles to do it.
[1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:18.420]  The problem was lipid nanoparticles went into ovaries, bone marrow, adrenal glands, and
[1:51:18.420 --> 1:51:19.660]  other tissues.
[1:51:19.660 --> 1:51:21.100]  So it's still being worked on.
[1:51:21.100 --> 1:51:27.300]  Studies are still being done, but I was going to ask Dr. Malone, because Dr. McCullough had
[1:51:27.300 --> 1:51:30.340]  just talked about the fact that he has concerns.
[1:51:30.340 --> 1:51:33.860]  Do you have concerns for this vaccine in children knowing that it's going in the brain, the
[1:51:33.860 --> 1:51:38.020]  bone marrow, the adrenals, and all these other organs?
[1:51:38.020 --> 1:51:39.020]  So the answer is yes.
[1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:40.580]  I've said that repeatedly.
[1:51:40.580 --> 1:51:46.300]  I've put out a four-minute clip in which I talk about the damage at risk to children
[1:51:46.300 --> 1:51:49.980]  in brain, heart, coagulopathy, reproductive systems, and reasons.
[1:51:49.980 --> 1:51:52.820]  I'm realizing something here now is Dr. Malone.
[1:51:52.820 --> 1:51:55.340]  The inventor of mRNA technology is speaking.
[1:51:55.340 --> 1:51:57.340]  You'd think you'd want to hear from him.
[1:51:57.340 --> 1:52:00.180]  If you're the media, you'd think you'd want to play this, and we all know what he's saying
[1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:01.540]  right now about it.
[1:52:01.540 --> 1:52:07.860]  But it's funny because of all the things that the COVID-19 vaccine does, you notice that
[1:52:07.860 --> 1:52:10.860]  it doesn't do the one thing they claim it's supposed to do.
[1:52:10.860 --> 1:52:17.860]  It doesn't stop COVID, and it never did, and it was never designed to.
[1:52:17.860 --> 1:52:22.740]  I mean, this is just, I'm telling you, man, you want to talk about science, fiction, dystopia.
[1:52:22.740 --> 1:52:24.340]  I mean, we are in it.
[1:52:24.340 --> 1:52:28.780]  They forced the vaccine in the name of COVID, but yet it doesn't stop COVID, and it does
[1:52:28.780 --> 1:52:32.100]  thousands of other things to your body except stopping COVID.
[1:52:32.100 --> 1:52:35.500]  Here's Dr. Malone, the inventor of the technology that they're injecting us with.
[1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:41.220]  It's in detail about reverse transcriptase and what it can do, et cetera.
[1:52:41.220 --> 1:52:50.860]  But I can tell you that we moved off of trying to develop further these mRNA and DNA complexes
[1:52:50.860 --> 1:52:54.060]  based on our work in non-human primates and in mice.
[1:52:54.060 --> 1:53:01.060]  We spent years with both commercial funding and various public funding, not NIH, trying
[1:53:01.060 --> 1:53:03.580]  to advance this technology.
[1:53:03.580 --> 1:53:09.580]  Many many different ketonic lipid formulations, compounds tested, screened for toxicity.
[1:53:09.580 --> 1:53:17.740]  We could never overcome the hyper-inflammatory characteristics of these polynucleotide lipid
[1:53:17.740 --> 1:53:19.220]  ketonic lipid complexes.
[1:53:19.220 --> 1:53:20.980]  We could never get there.
[1:53:20.980 --> 1:53:28.260]  Now the Carico and Weisman assertion, you know, it's a baseball.
[1:53:28.260 --> 1:53:35.180]  I brought Katie Carico into this, like a decade before, after I'd made the basic discoveries.
[1:53:35.180 --> 1:53:41.540]  They assert that the inclusion of the pseudo-uridine reduces the inflammatory response.
[1:53:41.540 --> 1:53:47.860]  But the data show that that is a marginal decrease, and the data also show from their
[1:53:47.860 --> 1:53:54.340]  competitor, it's important to remember, that they are biointegg Katie's vice president.
[1:53:54.340 --> 1:54:00.500]  So their competitor in Germany has shown very good immune response without the pseudo-uridine.
[1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:03.580]  So you're right, pseudo-uridine is a static compound.
[1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:09.100]  The logic is that incorporation of pseudo-uridine reduces the inflammatory response, but the
[1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:11.100]  inflammatory response is still there.
[1:54:11.100 --> 1:54:17.740]  And to your point, Richard, we are clearly seeing not only specific effects associated
[1:54:17.740 --> 1:54:22.740]  with spike protein, but non-specific effects associated with liponanopo complexes.
[1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:24.420]  How do we know that?
[1:54:24.420 --> 1:54:30.660]  Because Moderna gave us a presentation to their stockholders recently where they rolled
[1:54:30.660 --> 1:54:35.700]  out their phase one data on their influenza vaccine candidates that are using the same
[1:54:35.700 --> 1:54:37.420]  technology platform.
[1:54:37.420 --> 1:54:44.260]  So no spike protein associated influenza antigens, and in their hands at the 100 microgram dose,
[1:54:44.260 --> 1:54:52.500]  which is the dose that's used in the emergency use authorized vaccines, 90% of the subjects
[1:54:52.500 --> 1:54:56.620]  had adverse events compared to 30% in the placebo group.
[1:54:56.620 --> 1:54:58.380]  This is phase one data.
[1:54:58.380 --> 1:55:02.780]  Now that data has not been disclosed publicly, it was only disclosed to their stockholders.
[1:55:02.780 --> 1:55:08.260]  But what it clearly demonstrates is that the canonic lipid RNA complexes have intrinsic
[1:55:08.260 --> 1:55:13.500]  toxicity above and beyond just that associated with the spike.
[1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:18.940]  So when we get into these arguments about is it spike, is it the lipids, it's both.
[1:55:18.940 --> 1:55:20.580]  We have a tendency to get binary.
[1:55:20.580 --> 1:55:21.980]  It's either this or that.
[1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:30.780]  You know, it can be both regarding the data package from Japan that my rival first acquired
[1:55:30.780 --> 1:55:34.300]  and then I think I was the first after that.
[1:55:34.300 --> 1:55:38.260]  People often get confused about this, but Senator, this is the thing that worries me
[1:55:38.260 --> 1:55:46.380]  among the most, is that that limited data that was not produced to any quality standard
[1:55:46.380 --> 1:55:51.380]  that any clinical trial, you know, precursor, non-clinical data package I've ever seen
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:54.020]  would be allowed to be used.
[1:55:54.020 --> 1:56:00.020]  What the FDA and the regulatory authorities all over the world allowed was for Pfizer
[1:56:00.020 --> 1:56:08.300]  to collect data involving unrelated RNAs, other candidates, amalgamate it together
[1:56:08.300 --> 1:56:10.540]  and submit it as a package.
[1:56:10.540 --> 1:56:17.700]  And in those data, which are not according to good laboratory practices, they did demonstrate
[1:56:17.700 --> 1:56:22.620]  that these lipid nanoparticles go all over the body just as Richard is saying.
[1:56:22.620 --> 1:56:28.540]  And oddly, they seem to differentially go to ovaries and bone marrow, but ovaries relative
[1:56:28.540 --> 1:56:29.540]  to testes.
[1:56:29.540 --> 1:56:33.220]  And it's important everybody kind of latches on to this and they say, oh, there's spike
[1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:34.220]  protein in the ovaries.
[1:56:34.220 --> 1:56:35.700]  No, that's not what they measured.
[1:56:35.700 --> 1:56:38.820]  They didn't ever measure spike protein.
[1:56:38.820 --> 1:56:43.020]  What they measured was the lipid component, these synthetic lipids, which is the other
[1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:46.180]  thing you didn't mention in this cocktail, okay?
[1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:49.100]  These synthetic lipids go to ovaries.
[1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:50.100]  Who cares?
[1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:55.420]  Well, when your child is born, when your daughter is born, she has all the eggs she's ever going
[1:56:55.420 --> 1:56:57.420]  to have in her ovaries.
[1:56:57.420 --> 1:57:04.780]  And we do know that, and the CDC now finally acknowledges, after women all over the world
[1:57:04.780 --> 1:57:12.340]  complaining about their altered menses and getting, I mean, it was, I felt like I was
[1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:15.420]  in the mid 20th century.
[1:57:15.420 --> 1:57:19.740]  It was attributed to hysteria, much as your own story.
[1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:25.420]  These alterations and menstruation were believed to represent hysterical women.
[1:57:25.420 --> 1:57:28.860]  The CDC is now acknowledging it.
[1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:30.980]  Folks, this is incredible.
[1:57:30.980 --> 1:57:37.460]  The whole world needs to be hearing this right now.
[1:57:37.460 --> 1:57:40.700]  And I'm just overwhelmed with relief that everything we've been talking about for two
[1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:49.420]  years is now happening with world-renowned doctors and senators in massive panels.
[1:57:49.420 --> 1:57:52.940]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning.
[1:57:52.940 --> 1:57:53.940]  Something needs to change.
[1:57:53.940 --> 1:57:58.260]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to Reset Wars.
[1:57:58.260 --> 1:57:59.260]  It's really powerful.
[1:57:59.260 --> 1:58:03.940]  Reset Wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[1:58:03.940 --> 1:58:09.540]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[1:58:09.540 --> 1:58:11.820]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[1:58:11.820 --> 1:58:13.900]  I found it to be awesome.
[1:58:13.900 --> 1:58:15.260]  It was worth it to me.
[1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:21.260]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[1:58:21.260 --> 1:58:22.260]  knowledge.
[1:58:22.260 --> 1:58:23.260]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[1:58:23.260 --> 1:58:30.020]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information
[1:58:30.020 --> 1:58:35.220]  and experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is definitely
[1:58:35.220 --> 1:58:36.220]  afraid of.
[1:58:36.220 --> 1:58:39.100]  To think the way we are intended to think by God.
[1:58:39.100 --> 1:58:41.020]  That's what this series is about.
[1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:46.060]  Reset Wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[1:58:46.060 --> 1:58:47.060]  my hope.
[1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:51.660]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[1:58:51.660 --> 1:58:55.620]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far
[1:58:55.620 --> 1:58:56.620]  and wide.
[1:58:56.620 --> 1:58:57.620]  There is an awakening.
[1:58:57.620 --> 1:59:02.820]  Join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[1:59:02.820 --> 1:59:09.060]  Reset Wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also look
[1:59:09.060 --> 1:59:10.060]  at new material.
[1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:11.060]  I'm not disappointed.
[1:59:11.060 --> 1:59:13.700]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[1:59:13.700 --> 1:59:17.500]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more.
[1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:18.500]  It's moving me.
[1:59:18.500 --> 1:59:22.980]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like
[1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:25.540]  I got a lot of that from Reset Wars as well.
[1:59:25.540 --> 1:59:29.780]  The confidence and hope gained from Reset Wars is priceless.
[1:59:29.780 --> 1:59:31.140]  This isn't magic.
[1:59:31.140 --> 1:59:38.940]  This is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called The Matrix.
[1:59:38.940 --> 1:59:50.060]  Start your journey to true freedom now at ResetWars.com.
[1:59:50.060 --> 2:00:20.020]  I want to go right back to the hearing that's going
[2:00:20.020 --> 2:00:24.660]  on right now with world-renowned doctors and scientists, whistleblowers, Senator Ron Johnson
[2:00:24.660 --> 2:00:27.820]  chairing it, being ignored by the media for obvious reasons.
[2:00:27.820 --> 2:00:32.180]  They pushed this vaccine that's done so much damage now and got filthy rich off of biggest
[2:00:32.180 --> 2:00:33.900]  criminals you've ever heard of.
[2:00:33.900 --> 2:00:37.380]  Let's go back now live to the hearing.
[2:00:37.380 --> 2:00:39.060]  The skill of surgeons was unbelievable.
[2:00:39.060 --> 2:00:43.460]  They revamped the chamber of hearts or heart operates backwards today.
[2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:49.580]  So I enter this with just a deep respect for the phenomenon that is our healthcare system,
[2:00:49.580 --> 2:00:52.060]  for the doctors, all your training.
[2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:56.700]  One thing I definitely noticed though is as much as I value the skill, it was the care
[2:00:56.700 --> 2:01:00.700]  game of the nurses that I saw minute by minute.
[2:01:00.700 --> 2:01:02.580]  So I kind of want to wrap this up.
[2:01:02.580 --> 2:01:07.820]  We have very limited time, so please introduce yourself, tell your story, then we will wrap
[2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:08.820]  this up.
[2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:09.820]  Sure.
[2:01:09.820 --> 2:01:12.740]  Thank you, Senator, for giving me an uninterrupted opportunity to represent the harm that is
[2:01:12.740 --> 2:01:17.260]  coming to the patients in the American hospitals and the lack of early intervention.
[2:01:17.260 --> 2:01:18.260]  My name is Nicole Cerotec.
[2:01:18.260 --> 2:01:19.940]  I'm a registered nurse.
[2:01:19.940 --> 2:01:22.020]  I've been a registered nurse for over a decade.
[2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:25.980]  My specialty is critical care, trauma and flight.
[2:01:25.980 --> 2:01:30.380]  Since the start of the COVID pandemic, I've actually been rebranded, I guess you can say,
[2:01:30.380 --> 2:01:36.460]  as a leading expert in early intervention strategies executed on a large mass scale using
[2:01:36.460 --> 2:01:44.380]  the FLCCC protocol, as well as ventilator, COVID patient ventilator protective strategies
[2:01:44.380 --> 2:01:47.780]  to optimize COVID patients on the ventilators.
[2:01:47.780 --> 2:01:51.300]  My story actually begins back in May of 2020.
[2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:56.180]  I was one of the original nurses that went to NYC to help with the COVID pandemic, because
[2:01:56.180 --> 2:01:58.180]  as we remember, they needed nurses.
[2:01:58.180 --> 2:02:00.540]  Most importantly, they needed ventilators.
[2:02:00.540 --> 2:02:03.900]  Well, I was the whole package, a flight nurse that can manage ventilators.
[2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:10.380]  And when I arrived there, the gross negligence and the medical malfeasance that happened
[2:02:10.380 --> 2:02:15.820]  in there and the complete medical mismanagement of these patients is what has led us to the
[2:02:15.820 --> 2:02:18.140]  situation that we're in right now.
[2:02:18.140 --> 2:02:22.740]  The pandemic and the hysteria that was created from poor public health measures and poor
[2:02:22.740 --> 2:02:28.380]  execution of appropriate early intervention strategies and the handicapping of medical
[2:02:28.380 --> 2:02:34.140]  professionals doing their job has led to where we are right now and into the crisis situation
[2:02:34.140 --> 2:02:35.140]  that we are in.
[2:02:35.140 --> 2:02:41.020]  I will use several key case studies that will represent larger descriptive statistical information
[2:02:41.020 --> 2:02:43.140]  for what I'm going to speak of.
[2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:47.340]  But when I was in New York, and what continues to happen today is that many of them are not
[2:02:47.340 --> 2:02:48.900]  dying from COVID.
[2:02:48.900 --> 2:02:53.780]  Now, many people don't know about me is that I'm actually a master's prepared biochemist
[2:02:53.780 --> 2:02:59.580]  and I have worked extensively with the HIV virus tracking genetic mutations.
[2:02:59.580 --> 2:03:04.580]  So I feel very comfortable going toe to toe with some of these doctors here, although I
[2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.060]  am not a doctor, I'm just a nurse.
[2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:12.220]  But what we saw in these front lines, we knew what was happening.
[2:03:12.220 --> 2:03:15.500]  And when we asked for the IV profan, they said, no, it was contraindicated.
[2:03:15.500 --> 2:03:17.300]  When we asked, like, why aren't we giving them steroids?
[2:03:17.300 --> 2:03:18.300]  Oh, well, it's not.
[2:03:18.300 --> 2:03:20.340]  We're just following orders.
[2:03:20.340 --> 2:03:26.340]  Following orders has led to the sheer number of deaths that has occurred in these hospitals.
[2:03:26.340 --> 2:03:28.500]  I didn't see a single patient died of COVID.
[2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:35.900]  I've seen a substantial number of patients die of negligence and medical malfeasance.
[2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:40.420]  When I was on the front lines of New York, I'm unfortunately known globally viral as
[2:03:40.420 --> 2:03:44.900]  a nurse that was in the break room sobbing saying that they were murdering my patients.
[2:03:44.900 --> 2:03:50.820]  The pharmaceutical companies had gone into those hospitals and decided to practice, I
[2:03:50.820 --> 2:03:58.220]  guess you can say, on the minorities, on the disadvantaged, on the marginalized populations
[2:03:58.220 --> 2:04:00.540]  that we know that we had no advocates for.
[2:04:00.540 --> 2:04:04.420]  Because the very agencies that should have been protecting them were closed because we
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:06.260]  were sheltering in place.
[2:04:06.260 --> 2:04:10.020]  Now, when I was there and I saw that the pharmaceutical companies were rolling out
[2:04:10.020 --> 2:04:15.020]  Remdesivir onto the patients, I tried to get a hold of the IRBs, I tried to get a hold
[2:04:15.020 --> 2:04:20.540]  of my appropriate chain of command, I tried CMS, I tried Department of Health, and they
[2:04:20.540 --> 2:04:25.540]  rolled out Remdesivir onto a substantial number of patients for which we all saw it was killing
[2:04:25.540 --> 2:04:26.540]  the patients.
[2:04:26.540 --> 2:04:32.460]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is bombshell 2.0 now, where it's not just how they were
[2:04:32.460 --> 2:04:37.100]  lied, it's not just how we were lied to about the vaccines, but how we were lied to about
[2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:38.100]  the treatment.
[2:04:38.100 --> 2:04:43.140]  And so we're figuring it all out, folks, just, I mean, look, I know that this is so diabolical
[2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:48.460]  to hear me say this, but I mean, we're finding out how the treatment for COVID killed more
[2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:49.620]  people than COVID.
[2:04:49.620 --> 2:04:53.060]  That's what these doctors and nurses are saying right now, and we'll be right back with more
[2:04:53.060 --> 2:05:19.060]  live coverage.
[2:05:19.060 --> 2:05:24.060]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes, they want to bankrupt us and make us go away
[2:05:24.060 --> 2:05:25.060]  quietly.
[2:05:25.060 --> 2:05:30.900]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the
[2:05:30.900 --> 2:05:37.300]  traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[2:05:37.300 --> 2:05:41.220]  So be it, make them silence us by force.
[2:05:41.220 --> 2:05:48.340]  This is the final battle of the information war, give now, buy products, donate.
[2:05:48.340 --> 2:05:55.340]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:58.340]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:05:58.340 --> 2:06:03.420]  All right, just go ahead and kill the rejoin now.
[2:06:03.420 --> 2:06:04.940]  Let's go back live.
[2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:08.540]  You have a nurse right now talking about, which by the way, I've had multiple doctors
[2:06:08.540 --> 2:06:13.780]  on air with me explaining this exact same thing, talking about how she watched patients
[2:06:13.780 --> 2:06:19.620]  come into the hospital that died not from COVID, but because of the medical treatment
[2:06:19.620 --> 2:06:23.740]  they received, saying more people died from the medical treatment than the actual virus.
[2:06:23.740 --> 2:06:26.020]  Let's go back to her live.
[2:06:26.020 --> 2:06:31.780]  But in actuality, if they put down that it was a vaccine injury, the physician, the
[2:06:31.780 --> 2:06:34.860]  corporation, the hospital, the clinic, they actually won't get reimbursed, so it gets
[2:06:34.860 --> 2:06:42.420]  labeled as anxiety or neuropathy or Yanbar Ray syndrome when in actuality, it's very
[2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:44.980]  realistically a vaccine injury.
[2:06:44.980 --> 2:06:49.420]  Now I'm not, even though I founded American Frontline Nurses, I've traveled extensively
[2:06:49.420 --> 2:06:54.020]  to South America, India and South Africa, working in hot zones, stopping the spread
[2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:57.260]  of the virus, and working with early intervention.
[2:06:57.260 --> 2:07:02.060]  And nowhere in those countries and developing nations do I see these issues that we see
[2:07:02.060 --> 2:07:04.620]  here in the United States.
[2:07:04.620 --> 2:07:07.300]  It's actually, I'm a very proud American citizen.
[2:07:07.300 --> 2:07:10.980]  I come from a family of immigrants and my mother told me that the United States is the
[2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:15.460]  best country in the world, though granted I am biased being an American.
[2:07:15.460 --> 2:07:22.340]  And our level of health care has been deteriorated to substandard third world nation health
[2:07:22.340 --> 2:07:23.340]  care.
[2:07:23.340 --> 2:07:24.340]  Whereas I tell people you are better off than South America.
[2:07:24.340 --> 2:07:28.380]  Let's just be clear about this point she's making right here, because while I agree with
[2:07:28.380 --> 2:07:31.060]  her, there's another level to this.
[2:07:31.060 --> 2:07:38.660]  The American regime, the elites hate us so much that they would literally put profit
[2:07:38.660 --> 2:07:40.380]  above people.
[2:07:40.380 --> 2:07:43.780]  And so yeah, you've got these third world countries or these developing nations and
[2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:45.980]  she says, hey, how come they're not doing this to their people?
[2:07:45.980 --> 2:07:48.380]  How come they're not killing their people with their treatment?
[2:07:48.380 --> 2:07:56.300]  Because their elites aren't psychopaths, eugenicists, and people that are putting profit over people.
[2:07:56.300 --> 2:07:57.300]  That's what it is.
[2:07:57.300 --> 2:08:03.140]  They looked at this and they said, wow, how much money can we make off of this?
[2:08:03.140 --> 2:08:07.060]  How much of the population can we call with this?
[2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:13.620]  The two pronged operating system of the new world order, money, power, and eugenics.
[2:08:13.620 --> 2:08:15.060]  Money and power going hand in hand.
[2:08:15.060 --> 2:08:17.700]  And so that's what this nurse is explaining right now that she witnessed.
[2:08:17.700 --> 2:08:18.700]  Go back.
[2:08:18.700 --> 2:08:25.660]  United States, do we isolate people for hundreds of hours at a time with no human contact?
[2:08:25.660 --> 2:08:27.660]  It's not even allowed in the prisons.
[2:08:27.660 --> 2:08:32.220]  You are not allowed to isolate a prisoner for beyond a certain sensitive amount of time
[2:08:32.220 --> 2:08:35.020]  because it is again, it is horrible for their mental health.
[2:08:35.020 --> 2:08:37.620]  Unless you're a J6 defendant, then they can do that all day.
[2:08:37.620 --> 2:08:42.220]  However, in these hospitals now, we're allowed to isolate patients from their families for
[2:08:42.220 --> 2:08:48.260]  days and you have to say goodbye to them over an iPhone, as Jennifer Bridges has just demonstrated
[2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:52.380]  to us, or she has to shuttle people in to see.
[2:08:52.380 --> 2:08:57.660]  And personally, I was fired for sneaking a Hispanic family in to say the last rites to
[2:08:57.660 --> 2:08:58.660]  their family.
[2:08:58.660 --> 2:09:02.900]  And so thank you, Senator Johnson, for giving nurses the opportunity to come and represent
[2:09:02.900 --> 2:09:09.260]  our patients, because as you can see, we're not often thought of as leading professionals,
[2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:11.860]  though we are the missing link between the doctors and the patients.
[2:09:11.860 --> 2:09:13.460]  So thank you so much for this time.
[2:09:13.460 --> 2:09:18.460]  Thank you for being here.
[2:09:18.460 --> 2:09:26.420]  Where are the CNN cameras?
[2:09:26.420 --> 2:09:27.980]  Where are the ABC cameras?
[2:09:27.980 --> 2:09:29.500]  Where are the Fox News cameras?
[2:09:29.500 --> 2:09:32.180]  Where are the CBS NBC cameras?
[2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:33.180]  Where are they?
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:34.180]  Nope, they're not there.
[2:09:34.180 --> 2:09:35.780]  They don't want you to see this.
[2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:37.700]  It's both here today.
[2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:42.420]  Now, again, there's disagreement between people in this room.
[2:09:42.420 --> 2:09:46.900]  The viewpoints expressed were those of those individuals expressing it.
[2:09:46.900 --> 2:09:54.420]  But these are real world experiences from people that are on the front lines, that are
[2:09:54.420 --> 2:09:56.380]  treating patients.
[2:09:56.380 --> 2:10:01.220]  And it's different from probably anything you've heard, unless you've been following
[2:10:01.220 --> 2:10:06.740]  these people in the media, trying to break through, trying to convey the American public
[2:10:06.740 --> 2:10:14.820]  and provide the information that I think we all need, that we all deserve.
[2:10:14.820 --> 2:10:22.140]  Now, you know, my antenna is always up because I'm getting cues of spreading misinformation
[2:10:22.140 --> 2:10:23.340]  all the time.
[2:10:23.340 --> 2:10:27.420]  So I can imagine how the news media is going to treat so much of this.
[2:10:27.420 --> 2:10:32.340]  They're going to pick little phrases out, and they're going to pick it apart.
[2:10:32.340 --> 2:10:37.300]  And they're going to try and marginalize this entire event.
[2:10:37.300 --> 2:10:41.780]  All I can ask is the viewers to share this.
[2:10:41.780 --> 2:10:43.860]  Tell your friends, I know this is long.
[2:10:43.860 --> 2:10:46.260]  This is a five-hour-long panel.
[2:10:46.260 --> 2:10:53.300]  And we didn't even scratch the surface of what we need to discuss.
[2:10:53.300 --> 2:11:01.820]  This shouldn't have been necessary, as our information grew, as we became better and
[2:11:01.820 --> 2:11:07.340]  better educated, less ignorant about the coronavirus, COVID, the COVID vaccines.
[2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:13.460]  This should have been made public every step along the way, but it wasn't.
[2:11:13.460 --> 2:11:20.940]  So again, I'm just asking the viewing public to have an open mind, respect these individuals
[2:11:20.940 --> 2:11:29.060]  who have paid a significant price, professionally, reputationally.
[2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:32.300]  These are highly qualified individuals.
[2:11:32.300 --> 2:11:37.420]  They speak from experience.
[2:11:37.420 --> 2:11:40.220]  We've got to fix this problem.
[2:11:40.220 --> 2:11:42.460]  We can't let this continue.
[2:11:42.460 --> 2:11:44.260]  We can't let it happen in the future.
[2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:46.860]  So again, thank all of you for coming.
[2:11:46.860 --> 2:11:50.900]  Thank you for being doctors, for being nurses, for being accommodations, for being medical
[2:11:50.900 --> 2:11:54.100]  researchers, and thank all of you for viewing this.
[2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:55.100]  Share this with your friends.
[2:11:55.100 --> 2:11:56.100]  God bless you all.
[2:11:56.100 --> 2:12:05.140]  So there's Senator Ron Johnson closing it out as you heard a five-hour conference.
[2:12:05.140 --> 2:12:10.740]  Now, we're going to be getting one of the doctors, Dr. Marble, on with us here shortly,
[2:12:10.740 --> 2:12:14.500]  who was at that hearing.
[2:12:14.500 --> 2:12:15.900]  And so we're going to be getting connected with him.
[2:12:15.900 --> 2:12:21.180]  And we'll probably have him on either in the next segment or the segment after that.
[2:12:21.180 --> 2:12:31.380]  Wow, just wow.
[2:12:31.380 --> 2:12:36.780]  And what's so frustrating is just, it's like what Ron Johnson said at the end, it's just
[2:12:36.780 --> 2:12:40.100]  none of this ever had to happen, none of it.
[2:12:40.100 --> 2:12:41.100]  Not COVID.
[2:12:41.100 --> 2:12:42.260]  COVID didn't even have to happen.
[2:12:42.260 --> 2:12:48.860]  If you didn't have mad scientists like Fauci and Dasik running around with the Chinese
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:52.500]  Communist military making bio weapons, none of this would have ever happened.
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:13:02.420]  If you didn't have power-hungry eugenicists who wanted to take advantage of this man-made
[2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:07.540]  virus escaping from the lab to force a vaccine into you and bring in a world government with
[2:13:07.540 --> 2:13:11.180]  medical tyranny, never had to happen.
[2:13:11.180 --> 2:13:12.380]  None of it ever had to happen.
[2:13:12.380 --> 2:13:14.540]  We never had to be tormented like this.
[2:13:14.540 --> 2:13:16.500]  We never had to be tortured like this.
[2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:18.220]  We never had to be getting sick like this.
[2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:22.900]  We never had to lock down and destroy ourselves, destroy our economies, destroy our communities,
[2:13:22.900 --> 2:13:25.060]  destroy our relationships.
[2:13:25.060 --> 2:13:29.300]  None of this ever had to happen.
[2:13:29.300 --> 2:13:34.260]  And yet here we are two years down the road still dealing with the nonsense.
[2:13:34.260 --> 2:13:40.260]  And there's people who want it to continue, never want it to go away, and want to hide
[2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:44.140]  the truth from being discovered.
[2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:46.380]  And I mean, this is about as evil as it gets, folks.
[2:13:46.380 --> 2:13:52.020]  I mean, I would be shocked.
[2:13:52.020 --> 2:13:57.940]  I mean, it's probably going to get worse before it gets better, but I mean, you got to wonder
[2:13:57.940 --> 2:13:59.900]  how much worse can it get?
[2:13:59.900 --> 2:14:05.940]  I just had a panel of doctors and nurses explaining how COVID vaccines are causing cancer, COVID
[2:14:05.940 --> 2:14:11.500]  vaccines are killing people, and more people died from the treatment, the medical treatment
[2:14:11.500 --> 2:14:14.660]  of COVID than the virus itself.
[2:14:14.660 --> 2:14:19.700]  I mean, talk about an alley-oop between mad scientists and big pharma.
[2:14:19.700 --> 2:14:25.740]  Hey, we'll create a lab that does bioweapons research, we'll release the virus, we'll cause
[2:14:25.740 --> 2:14:31.060]  the world to go into a panic, and then you can alley-oop it by releasing your experimental
[2:14:31.060 --> 2:14:36.380]  vaccines, and we'll make sure our friends in the media don't know the truth about any
[2:14:36.380 --> 2:14:40.460]  of it.
[2:14:40.460 --> 2:14:48.900]  So one group gets what they want, a virus escaping a lab, the other group gets what
[2:14:48.900 --> 2:14:54.420]  it wants, total medical world tyranny government, and then there's the media there to cover
[2:14:54.420 --> 2:15:00.500]  it all up, make sure you know nothing about it, and censor anybody who dares speak the
[2:15:00.500 --> 2:15:01.500]  truth.
[2:15:01.500 --> 2:15:06.660]  How many people on that panel do you think are banned on social media?
[2:15:06.660 --> 2:15:09.500]  Probably most for telling the truth.
[2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:14.460]  So I mean, when you really soak it all in, when you really absorb it, when you really
[2:15:14.460 --> 2:15:21.980]  look at it for what it is, I would say that there's not too many people listening to this,
[2:15:21.980 --> 2:15:26.460]  not too many people on this planet that have experienced worse evil than what we're seeing
[2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:28.820]  today.
[2:15:28.820 --> 2:15:30.380]  Very few people.
[2:15:30.380 --> 2:15:36.660]  For the majority of humans alive on this planet today, we are experiencing the worst
[2:15:36.660 --> 2:15:44.180]  evil that we have ever seen in our lives, and we are just begging God for divine intervention,
[2:15:44.180 --> 2:15:52.460]  just begging God for an answer, just pleading, please stop this madness, please rescue us
[2:15:52.460 --> 2:15:57.500]  from this hell that we're going into.
[2:15:57.500 --> 2:16:02.900]  Most of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply
[2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:04.580]  chain breakdowns.
[2:16:04.580 --> 2:16:08.140]  You've done a great job supporting info wars and supporting your immune system.
[2:16:08.140 --> 2:16:12.340]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the great reset, we can't get these products
[2:16:12.340 --> 2:16:13.340]  in.
[2:16:13.340 --> 2:16:19.060]  So finally, they came in but a limited run of our whole food, vitamin, mineral, essential,
[2:16:19.060 --> 2:16:23.820]  nutrient, multivitamins, so you absorb it, and so it's not toxic in your body like synthetic
[2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:24.820]  vitamins.
[2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:30.140]  So of course, vitamin C and zinc, this sucker is really full and heavy because it's a huge
[2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:33.820]  dose of vitamin C and zinc and roseps.
[2:16:33.820 --> 2:16:37.340]  Number one thing you can do if you're immune system and your body, it does so much more.
[2:16:37.340 --> 2:16:43.140]  Both of these are now back in stock at infowarsstore.com for 40% off, and I'm going to keep you at

[2:17:57.180 --> 2:18:00.020]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:18:00.020 --> 2:18:04.300]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:18:04.300 --> 2:18:10.300]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[2:18:10.300 --> 2:18:13.980]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:18:13.980 --> 2:18:18.900]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:18:18.900 --> 2:18:23.060]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[2:18:23.060 --> 2:18:27.340]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:18:27.340 --> 2:18:30.020]  That's why everybody should visit infowarsstore.com.

[2:19:54.540 --> 2:19:58.260]  fine.
[2:19:58.260 --> 2:20:14.260]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:14.260 --> 2:20:19.980]  So you just heard from the hearing with Senator Ron Johnson and dozens of doctors and nurses
[2:20:19.980 --> 2:20:25.060]  and scientists and everything else.
[2:20:25.060 --> 2:20:31.620]  And we are now joined by one of the doctors that was there, Dr. Ben Marble from MyFreeDoctor.com
[2:20:31.620 --> 2:20:32.620]  is with us.
[2:20:32.620 --> 2:20:36.900]  He's still in DC, just outside of the room where the hearing went down.
[2:20:36.900 --> 2:20:39.820]  So we go live now to Dr. Ben Marble.
[2:20:39.820 --> 2:20:45.220]  Dr, just give us your first response, the hearing has just been let out, just give us
[2:20:45.220 --> 2:20:48.620]  your first initial reaction to everything that we heard today.
[2:20:48.620 --> 2:20:53.980]  Well, I think it kind of summarized the narrative of exactly what we've been seeing that's
[2:20:53.980 --> 2:21:04.220]  going on globally, the crazy mandates from on high, the poison that is basically a fake
[2:21:04.220 --> 2:21:08.980]  vaccine that's killing people and injuring people all over the world.
[2:21:08.980 --> 2:21:16.900]  So hopefully, all the panelists that spoke, I think we've knocked it out of the park and
[2:21:16.900 --> 2:21:21.260]  the world should be aware of what's going on now, finally, because we've been silent
[2:21:21.260 --> 2:21:27.380]  so much over and over and over, all the censorship on social media, Facebook, YouTube, all those
[2:21:27.380 --> 2:21:31.460]  sites that shut us down, Twitter, and won't let the truth be heard.
[2:21:31.460 --> 2:21:37.860]  So the truth is finally heard today for the whole world to know and the simple thing is
[2:21:37.860 --> 2:21:42.980]  early treatment works, fake vaccines do not, mRNA gene therapy is not a vaccine and never
[2:21:42.980 --> 2:21:48.220]  will be, it's poison, and no human should take poison.
[2:21:48.220 --> 2:21:50.620]  We need to ban the poison as soon as possible.
[2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:59.540]  And going forward, what needs to happen is we need a rest of Dr. Beth Falsy and all his
[2:21:59.540 --> 2:22:08.020]  co-conspirators like Bill Gates of Hell and Klaus Schwab, George Soras, et cetera, those
[2:22:08.020 --> 2:22:12.780]  guys all need to be on trial in Nuremberg 2.0 as soon as possible.
[2:22:12.780 --> 2:22:17.900]  Now tell me, because the only network, the only media that we even saw covering it at
[2:22:17.900 --> 2:22:20.180]  all was One America Newsnet.
[2:22:20.180 --> 2:22:23.900]  So as far as I know, there was only one camera there even filming.
[2:22:23.900 --> 2:22:25.260]  Were there other cameras there?
[2:22:25.260 --> 2:22:26.260]  Was there other media there?
[2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:29.260]  Or was it truly just One America Newsnet?
[2:22:29.260 --> 2:22:36.460]  One America News was the only sort of main provider I saw, but there were 10 different
[2:22:36.460 --> 2:22:42.300]  cameras filming live in Nuremberg at the time, so I'm not sure who, but all, CNN wasn't there,
[2:22:42.300 --> 2:22:46.540]  Fox wasn't there, I didn't see any of those people there, but a lot of independent journalists
[2:22:46.540 --> 2:22:48.380]  and things like that were there filming.
[2:22:48.380 --> 2:22:51.980]  Certainly I think the most important people filming was C-SPAN and playing it live for
[2:22:51.980 --> 2:22:53.500]  the whole world to see.
[2:22:53.500 --> 2:22:58.100]  And now it's in the public senate record for the world to know about.
[2:22:58.100 --> 2:23:01.700]  What is the chatter between the doctors before and after these hearings?
[2:23:01.700 --> 2:23:05.580]  I mean, because this is extremely powerful and important information, I would imagine
[2:23:05.580 --> 2:23:11.260]  even the side conversations that go down are very important for people to know about.
[2:23:11.260 --> 2:23:17.140]  Well, you know, the doctors we have, I mean, we, for example, we don't call them hospitals,
[2:23:17.140 --> 2:23:21.220]  we call them health spills, because they're basically the new concentration camp that,
[2:23:21.220 --> 2:23:26.380]  you know, they, we know early treatment works, so when the patient, if patient's unlucky
[2:23:26.380 --> 2:23:29.980]  enough to get admitted to hospital and they stop everything that works and they're maximized
[2:23:29.980 --> 2:23:35.220]  on everything that causes death, then at some point you have to realize that, you know,
[2:23:35.220 --> 2:23:40.980]  these are evil people doing intentional harm, this is intentional mass genocide and it needs
[2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:46.100]  to stop and they need to be held accountable and on trial as soon as possible.
[2:23:46.100 --> 2:23:50.540]  Dr. Ben Marble is with us, myfreedoctor.com.
[2:23:50.540 --> 2:23:55.540]  Obviously Senator Ron Johnson has been kind of the leader of this, getting these hearings
[2:23:55.540 --> 2:23:57.500]  done, he's done multiple hearings.
[2:23:57.500 --> 2:24:00.140]  What about, is there anybody else from Congress that's interested in this?
[2:24:00.140 --> 2:24:02.180]  Was anybody else from Congress there?
[2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:05.060]  Have you heard any interest from other members of Congress?
[2:24:05.060 --> 2:24:12.220]  No, there was no one else from Congress there that I'm aware of, so that's certainly a problem
[2:24:12.220 --> 2:24:14.500]  and we need more people on our side.
[2:24:14.500 --> 2:24:17.820]  That's the problem with the Republican Party, there's too many rhinos, you know, I call
[2:24:17.820 --> 2:24:23.100]  it the PC Party, both Democrats and Republicans are controlled by political correctness and
[2:24:23.100 --> 2:24:27.380]  that's the root of all this evil, political correctness is a crime against humanity.
[2:24:27.380 --> 2:24:32.060]  You know, they banned being a Nazi in 1946, you couldn't join the Nazi Party, but political
[2:24:32.060 --> 2:24:36.420]  correctness should be banned globally because it's the active denial of reality, simplest
[2:24:36.420 --> 2:24:42.180]  example, men cannot have babies, no person can change their sex, you have to pretend
[2:24:42.180 --> 2:24:46.340]  that they can and if you don't play pretend, then you're supposedly a bad person, so well
[2:24:46.340 --> 2:24:48.340]  that's just an evil ideology.
[2:24:48.340 --> 2:24:54.020]  The problem is as we now see people for two, twenty to thirty years thought political correctness
[2:24:54.020 --> 2:24:58.220]  was just good manners, but as we now know, political correctness gets people killed,
[2:24:58.220 --> 2:25:01.180]  so that's why we need to get rid of political correctness that needs to be thrown in the
[2:25:01.180 --> 2:25:02.420]  garbage where it belongs.
[2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:07.420]  Yeah, political correctness has really just turned into not telling the truth because
[2:25:07.420 --> 2:25:11.340]  some brainwashed fool is going to have their feelings hurt, well why should that stop me
[2:25:11.340 --> 2:25:16.220]  from telling the truth if that's what's going on and with the vaccine side effects, it's
[2:25:16.220 --> 2:25:20.860]  probably the worst example where, oh don't say anything negative about the vaccines,
[2:25:20.860 --> 2:25:25.700]  you might hurt someone's feelings, well wait a second, since when do we censor the truth?
[2:25:25.700 --> 2:25:30.340]  I guess in this last recent decade here in America we've decided to censor the truth.
[2:25:30.340 --> 2:25:35.460]  Dr. Marble, what other highlights do you think came out of this hearing today that really
[2:25:35.460 --> 2:25:39.900]  should resonate with the people or be amplified?
[2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:44.300]  Certainly the obvious fact of the vaccine is not safe, it is not effective, anybody,
[2:25:44.300 --> 2:25:48.940]  and it's really not even a vaccine, I hate to even use that word, it's a fake vaccine,
[2:25:48.940 --> 2:25:53.740]  and the average public hasn't understood a lot of this, they just think, hey it's probably
[2:25:53.740 --> 2:25:58.740]  just another safe vaccine, but it's anything but a vaccine, it's gene therapy, and gene
[2:25:58.740 --> 2:26:05.140]  therapy changes, permanently alters your God-given DNA, that's a horrible idea, and it's killing
[2:26:05.140 --> 2:26:10.300]  thousands and thousands of people, so basically we need to ban the poison, but hopefully the
[2:26:10.300 --> 2:26:15.500]  average, I've tried to talk in common sense, and a lot of physicians talk, their message
[2:26:15.500 --> 2:26:18.260]  is kind of directed to other physicians, and they talk high level science that the average
[2:26:18.260 --> 2:26:22.980]  person doesn't understand, and that's why I say talking simple language, poison is
[2:26:22.980 --> 2:26:28.460]  poisonous, and no human should take poison, and we need to ban the poison and stop giving
[2:26:28.460 --> 2:26:32.940]  it to people, and then we need to hold the people who push this poison on the world,
[2:26:32.940 --> 2:26:37.980]  you know, over 9 billion doses of the poison have been given in the year 2021, and that's
[2:26:37.980 --> 2:26:43.260]  why in the year 2022 we're going to see the mass die off of 2022, more people will die
[2:26:43.260 --> 2:26:49.580]  in 2022 than any year in human history, and it's entirely because 9 billion doses of poison
[2:26:49.580 --> 2:26:53.660]  have already been given, and that's why they're wrapping up the program and flip-flopping
[2:26:53.660 --> 2:26:59.420]  on all these things, because they've maximized, they've already given 9 billion doses, approximately
[2:26:59.420 --> 2:27:02.700]  2 billion people, so nobody else is going to take it, so now they're going to go ahead
[2:27:02.700 --> 2:27:09.100]  and flip-flop the narrative, and then all they have to do is wait for everybody to die,
[2:27:09.100 --> 2:27:13.780]  and the good news, the good news is this, early treatment, early treatment works, we've
[2:27:13.780 --> 2:27:19.180]  now delivered, myfreedoctor.com has now delivered 150,000 free doctor visits to America, we
[2:27:19.180 --> 2:27:23.180]  have a 99.99% survival rate with early treatment, so we know early treatment works, we know
[2:27:23.180 --> 2:27:28.380]  the fake vaccine does not work unless you're trying to kill somebody, so it's pretty simple,
[2:27:28.380 --> 2:27:32.940]  you take early treatment, it works if you're vaccinated or not vaccinated, and don't take
[2:27:32.940 --> 2:27:37.740]  poison, and that's pretty simple, if you want to be alive in 2025, that's what you need
[2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:41.060]  to do, because a lot of people are going to die, a lot of people are going to, you know,
[2:27:41.060 --> 2:27:46.020]  the COVID rates are through the roof right now, and it's entirely because of the poison,
[2:27:46.020 --> 2:27:49.700]  and so those people who get sick, they need to get early treatment as soon as possible,
[2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:53.300]  I can't stress that enough, everybody should have these meds at home, it was up to me,
[2:27:53.300 --> 2:27:57.100]  these meds would all be over the counter, and people could get them without a prescription,
[2:27:57.100 --> 2:28:01.020]  I don't make those rules, so we have to work with what we have, but everybody should have
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:05.780]  these meds before they get sick, in their medicine cabinet at home, so that the day
[2:28:05.780 --> 2:28:09.780]  they get sick, if they can start their treatment within one to two days, they're not going
[2:28:09.780 --> 2:28:14.260]  to go to the hospital, they're not going to die, so that's the good news, early treatment
[2:28:14.260 --> 2:28:19.940]  does work, and you can get E.T. for free via MFB at myfreedoctor.com, I encourage everybody
[2:28:19.940 --> 2:28:21.420]  to do that.
[2:28:21.420 --> 2:28:26.140]  Wow, I want to expand on what you were just saying about the vaccine, because I do think
[2:28:26.140 --> 2:28:31.700]  that that's the most important thing for us to talk about now is how just the basic concept
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:36.820]  of this COVID vaccine has been a lie from the very get go, and that was communicated
[2:28:36.820 --> 2:28:41.020]  very well today, so I want to expand on that when we come back with Dr. Ben Marble, again
[2:28:41.020 --> 2:28:45.340]  myfreedoctor.com, he's helped a lot of people folks, yeah, there's a real man made virus
[2:28:45.340 --> 2:28:49.420]  going around, it's definitely going around, but it doesn't have to kill you, and it doesn't
[2:28:49.420 --> 2:28:58.220]  have to put you into a medical fascistic tyranny worldwide, we'll be right back.
[2:28:58.220 --> 2:29:06.100]  Reset horses, but a great tool, amazing, and eye-opening, it really dives deeper into
[2:29:06.100 --> 2:29:11.860]  yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily go across political lines
[2:29:11.860 --> 2:29:16.340]  or religious lines, but about all of us as a human species coming together.
[2:29:16.340 --> 2:29:22.260]  I'm a combat veteran, and I mean, that brought me close to God, but what Alex goes through
[2:29:22.260 --> 2:29:23.580]  brought me even closer.
[2:29:23.580 --> 2:29:28.420]  I can feel God in my life now, the viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously
[2:29:28.420 --> 2:29:34.140]  programmed into your brain, and how to erase those programs and install new.
[2:29:34.140 --> 2:29:38.740]  Reset Wars is a step beyond what you already get in regular Info Wars broadcasts.

[2:31:01.940 --> 2:31:02.940]  back in stock.
[2:31:02.940 --> 2:31:08.340]  Whole food multivitamin, a central nutrient multivitamin from natural healthy sources,
[2:31:08.340 --> 2:31:13.900]  not synthetic, and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel
[2:31:13.900 --> 2:31:18.260]  Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[2:31:18.260 --> 2:31:24.180]  They're both back in stock, sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[2:31:24.180 --> 2:31:28.780]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is, this will fund our operation and
[2:31:28.780 --> 2:31:29.780]  keep us on air.
[2:31:29.780 --> 2:31:37.540]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin
[2:31:37.540 --> 2:31:42.180]  and take vitamin C and take zinc, and we also have some great vitamin D products at infowarstore.com
[2:31:42.180 --> 2:31:47.140]  for you as well, but whatever you do, defend your body's immune system, we want to keep
[2:31:47.140 --> 2:31:49.100]  patriots in the game against the new world order.

[2:31:53.460 --> 2:31:57.580]  and your immune system while funding the info war at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:57.580 --> 2:32:03.100]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:32:03.100 --> 2:32:08.780]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:32:08.780 --> 2:32:12.980]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:32:12.980 --> 2:32:18.100]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[2:32:18.100 --> 2:32:22.940]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:32:22.940 --> 2:32:27.380]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[2:32:27.380 --> 2:32:32.260]  unbelievably unsettling to see, but there is only two things to do.
[2:32:32.260 --> 2:32:35.380]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:32:35.380 --> 2:32:40.180]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win, but even when we win, and we
[2:32:40.180 --> 2:32:45.980]  eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end, and so we must prepare,
[2:32:45.980 --> 2:32:51.980]  get up to a years worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, short
[2:32:51.980 --> 2:32:58.500]  wave radios, and life saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[2:32:58.500 --> 2:33:05.820]  Ending of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:05.820 --> 2:33:16.300]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance,
[2:33:16.300 --> 2:33:18.940]  and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[2:33:18.940 --> 2:33:26.620]  Dr. Ben Marble is with us here on the Alex Jones show, his website, MyFreeDoctor.com.
[2:33:26.620 --> 2:33:30.540]  I want to expand on what we were talking about with the vaccine that I think is so important,
[2:33:30.540 --> 2:33:36.100]  but before I go back into that, doctor, I mean, how do you explain this?
[2:33:36.100 --> 2:33:41.100]  I can go to India or Japan or El Salvador or Mexico or all these different countries,
[2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:44.780]  and what are they giving their citizens to treat COVID?
[2:33:44.780 --> 2:33:50.460]  They're giving them vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D and ivermectin, and they call them
[2:33:50.460 --> 2:33:53.260]  blister kits, and it's like 30 bucks tops.
[2:33:53.260 --> 2:33:55.660]  Some of them are giving away for free.
[2:33:55.660 --> 2:34:01.420]  Why do we see this in all the other countries, yet our elite and our government is only forcing
[2:34:01.420 --> 2:34:04.340]  the non-vaccine, uh, vaccine poison on us?
[2:34:04.340 --> 2:34:07.460]  I mean, how do you even, how do you even rationalize that?
[2:34:07.460 --> 2:34:11.220]  How do you wrap your head around that this is what's going on in the world?
[2:34:11.220 --> 2:34:14.660]  Well, you know, it sounds kind of crazy.
[2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:19.300]  Two years ago, I just thought this was never be possible, but how that's happening is basically
[2:34:19.300 --> 2:34:23.780]  Nazi Fauci or Dr. Death Fauci, whatever you want to call him.
[2:34:23.780 --> 2:34:29.380]  He's the dictator, and all his demands, uh, all his dictates must be followed, and if
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:34.620]  you don't follow him, you're at risk of losing your license on, uh, being vilified and ostracized,
[2:34:34.620 --> 2:34:40.500]  lose your job, and so the doctors are afraid to prescribe, uh, certainly, uh, those other
[2:34:40.500 --> 2:34:43.780]  countries that are doing that, they're doing a good thing for their, for their people,
[2:34:43.780 --> 2:34:47.740]  and so, you know, when people keep doing bad things and people keep dying and then they
[2:34:47.740 --> 2:34:52.060]  keep doubling down on all the bad things that we know kill people, at some point you have
[2:34:52.060 --> 2:34:57.140]  to realize that that's not innocent mistakes, that's just pure evil, uh, and it's pure evil
[2:34:57.140 --> 2:35:02.900]  in action, it's mass genocide, it's eugenics, you know, gene therapy alters your, your genetic
[2:35:02.900 --> 2:35:10.300]  code, there's arguments to be made that it was designed to selectively target, uh, African
[2:35:10.300 --> 2:35:18.460]  Americans and other racial groups, so that's, uh, eugenics is a war crime, uh, and Dr.
[2:35:18.460 --> 2:35:22.220]  Dethalsy is a war criminal and needs to be arrested.
[2:35:22.220 --> 2:35:25.340]  Let's get back into the, uh, let's get back into the vaccine now, because I think this
[2:35:25.340 --> 2:35:30.660]  is extremely important, and I get, it's shocking for people to hear this, it's just the facts.
[2:35:30.660 --> 2:35:34.140]  The COVID vaccine is not a vaccine.
[2:35:34.140 --> 2:35:38.900]  Not only is it not a vaccine, what was well communicated today that really kind of cemented
[2:35:38.900 --> 2:35:42.780]  in my head, which, which already knew, but maybe it was kind of floating ideas that compacted
[2:35:42.780 --> 2:35:48.100]  today, not only is the COVID-19 vaccine not a vaccine.
[2:35:48.100 --> 2:35:54.740]  If there was a list of things that the COVID-19 not vaccine does, protecting you from COVID
[2:35:54.740 --> 2:35:57.140]  would be at the bottom of the list.
[2:35:57.140 --> 2:35:58.740]  It literally doesn't even do that.
[2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:02.940]  It does hundreds of other things to your body, protecting you from COVID isn't even one of
[2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:03.940]  them.
[2:36:03.940 --> 2:36:04.940]  Yep.
[2:36:04.940 --> 2:36:05.940]  It's, it's nuts.
[2:36:05.940 --> 2:36:11.140]  It's, well, basically the, uh, the vaccine is the cell spreading biotear weapon, because
[2:36:11.140 --> 2:36:15.380]  what we know causes all the symptoms of COVID, the COVID virus is a real virus, but it's
[2:36:15.380 --> 2:36:17.540]  a man made Frankenstein virus.
[2:36:17.540 --> 2:36:20.780]  And the most dangerous part of that virus is the spike protein.
[2:36:20.780 --> 2:36:25.780]  So these fake vaccine gene therapies, they make your body produce the most dangerous part.
[2:36:25.780 --> 2:36:27.860]  They make your body make the poison.
[2:36:27.860 --> 2:36:31.980]  So how anyone, same person could think that that's a good idea.
[2:36:31.980 --> 2:36:35.540]  And so you put, you put the shot into your body and then your body starts making the
[2:36:35.540 --> 2:36:36.540]  spike protein.
[2:36:36.540 --> 2:36:37.540]  No surprise.
[2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:38.540]  You get ill.
[2:36:38.540 --> 2:36:39.540]  You get all the symptoms of COVID.
[2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:42.820]  The vast majority of the symptoms of COVID are caused by the spike protein.
[2:36:42.820 --> 2:36:48.220]  And then, uh, you get sick and you have a positive test also from the spike protein.
[2:36:48.220 --> 2:36:53.300]  And so for example, if you then get admitted to the hospital and you die less than 14 days,
[2:36:53.300 --> 2:36:56.500]  then that's considered a COVID death, not a vaccine death.
[2:36:56.500 --> 2:36:59.780]  And that's just a great example of how to lie with statistics.
[2:36:59.780 --> 2:37:00.780]  It's a great big lie.
[2:37:00.780 --> 2:37:04.460]  And when they talk about the globalists, the Davos and the world economic form, and they
[2:37:04.460 --> 2:37:08.700]  talk about the great reset, what they're really talking about, the grace, the great reset
[2:37:08.700 --> 2:37:10.780]  is really the great coal of the human herd.
[2:37:10.780 --> 2:37:11.780]  That's what they're talking about.
[2:37:11.780 --> 2:37:14.380]  They're going to kill everybody on purpose.
[2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:17.780]  And then after everybody dies, because now that nine million doses have been given, all
[2:37:17.780 --> 2:37:20.540]  they have to do is wait for everybody to die.
[2:37:20.540 --> 2:37:26.300]  And so then after everybody dies, you know, 15 to 20% of the population dies from this.
[2:37:26.300 --> 2:37:29.780]  Uh, then they reset and then they can build back better.
[2:37:29.780 --> 2:37:34.940]  So you know, it's, it's all a globalist agenda plan to destroy America and bring in the one
[2:37:34.940 --> 2:37:39.580]  world government, uh, and we need to stop it.
[2:37:39.580 --> 2:37:43.820]  And when it comes because it seems to me, and I wonder what your opinion on this is,
[2:37:43.820 --> 2:37:49.140]  it seems to me, you know, you get one vaccine, maybe two, hell, maybe even three doses.
[2:37:49.140 --> 2:37:53.580]  You might be able to, uh, to recover or stave off the long-term effects, but I mean, they
[2:37:53.580 --> 2:37:54.580]  keep pushing boosters.
[2:37:54.580 --> 2:37:56.860]  I mean, you're talking about four, five, six, seven.
[2:37:56.860 --> 2:38:00.820]  I mean, what is the threshold going to be where it's like, okay, zero doubt.
[2:38:00.820 --> 2:38:02.660]  You get X number of vaccines.
[2:38:02.660 --> 2:38:04.060]  It's you're just done.
[2:38:04.060 --> 2:38:08.580]  Well, that's the, the thing, the whole fully, fully vaccinated is, is a lie.
[2:38:08.580 --> 2:38:11.580]  That's a propaganda term because you can never be fully vaccinated.
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:13.220]  You always need another dose and another dose.
[2:38:13.220 --> 2:38:16.380]  If you're still alive, you need another dose until you're dead.
[2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:20.460]  And it sounds nuts, but that's the reality we're seeing.
[2:38:20.460 --> 2:38:24.460]  And uh, so I just tell people, simple plain talk, don't take poison, you know, because
[2:38:24.460 --> 2:38:26.420]  if you do, you might want enough debt.
[2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:29.180]  And then there's the other issue of the spike protein shedding.
[2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:33.020]  You know, the people who get the fake vaccine, they shed the spike protein where they go.
[2:38:33.020 --> 2:38:37.060]  So for example, pregnant women need to avoid people who are recently vaccinated because
[2:38:37.060 --> 2:38:42.020]  we've seen many cases of pregnant women having miscarriages after hanging around with vaccinated
[2:38:42.020 --> 2:38:43.020]  people.
[2:38:43.020 --> 2:38:48.700]  Certainly we heard the stats of miscarriages are up 300% in vaccinated people.
[2:38:48.700 --> 2:38:51.580]  So all signs are bad.
[2:38:51.580 --> 2:38:57.460]  And yet the media, the censorship, the trusted news initiative and walking in a lock step,
[2:38:57.460 --> 2:39:01.420]  they all won't let the truth come out and they try to censor us all.
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:06.780]  And so I'm really happy that today we finally at least got the truth out to the people now
[2:39:06.780 --> 2:39:09.980]  here at Senator Johnson's hearing.
[2:39:09.980 --> 2:39:14.260]  The one thing that was kind of news to me, I mean, we already had some inclinations of
[2:39:14.260 --> 2:39:20.060]  this, but now it seems the doctors have the research and the data to back it up.
[2:39:20.060 --> 2:39:24.060]  Talk about the discussion today when it came to the COVID vaccines being linked to cancer
[2:39:24.060 --> 2:39:25.060]  now.
[2:39:25.060 --> 2:39:32.300]  We've been hearing that for probably a good nine, 10 months, so many of our pathologists
[2:39:32.300 --> 2:39:38.780]  and including Dr. Cole, that when they're looking at their slides under the microscope,
[2:39:38.780 --> 2:39:43.900]  they're diagnostic rates of cancer are just going through the roof of all kinds of cancers
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:46.540]  in the people that are vaccinated.
[2:39:46.540 --> 2:39:48.300]  And so that's just another thing.
[2:39:48.300 --> 2:39:51.900]  There's a couple of different things where people die from the fake vaccine.
[2:39:51.900 --> 2:39:56.140]  There's the acute death in one to two days, the people die of heart attacks and strokes
[2:39:56.140 --> 2:39:58.180]  and blood clots, pulmonary amylase.
[2:39:58.180 --> 2:40:06.140]  There's the long-term, longer-term issues like cancer, the immune suppression where
[2:40:06.140 --> 2:40:10.020]  people are getting basically what we're calling VADES, which is vaccine-induced AIDS, and
[2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:11.740]  it expresses their whole immune system.
[2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:16.540]  Then they wind up with all sorts of weird, they wind up with weird infections like shingles
[2:40:16.540 --> 2:40:23.220]  and cytomegalovirus and other infections people don't typically get, much like what
[2:40:23.220 --> 2:40:26.940]  happened with the AIDS pandemic.
[2:40:26.940 --> 2:40:28.740]  So we're seeing that across the board.
[2:40:28.740 --> 2:40:32.340]  There's so much evidence, there's just a mountain of evidence.
[2:40:32.340 --> 2:40:37.580]  It clearly proves they're not safe, they're not effective, they're not vaccines, they're
[2:40:37.580 --> 2:40:38.580]  poison.
[2:40:38.580 --> 2:40:41.540]  And we need to ban the poison, ban the poison, ban the poison.
[2:40:41.540 --> 2:40:46.380]  I cannot say that enough because we can deliver early treatment and save people's lives because
[2:40:46.380 --> 2:40:50.900]  you keep taking poison, then you're probably going to wind up dead.
[2:40:50.900 --> 2:40:54.340]  Dr. Marble, we thank you for joining us today.
[2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:56.540]  We thank you for being a part of this hearing.
[2:40:56.540 --> 2:40:59.700]  What are some final comments here before we let you go?
[2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:06.020]  Well, you know, I certainly appreciate you guys and everything you all are doing.
[2:41:06.020 --> 2:41:13.820]  You were some of the few sources that actually let the truth be heard, so you guys are really
[2:41:13.820 --> 2:41:18.020]  doing a service for the world to help us say, we're in a war, this is a biological war,
[2:41:18.020 --> 2:41:24.860]  this is bioterrorism, it was unleashed upon us from Wuhan, of course, everybody is aware
[2:41:24.860 --> 2:41:30.260]  of that, and why would we give the Wuhan bioterror to our citizens?
[2:41:30.260 --> 2:41:32.220]  How does that make any sense at all?
[2:41:32.220 --> 2:41:34.300]  It doesn't, it's the correct answer.
[2:41:34.300 --> 2:41:38.500]  And so we need to put a stop to it as quickly as possible.
[2:41:38.500 --> 2:41:41.660]  We started seeing the vaccine injuries here, I started hearing about them because I have
[2:41:41.660 --> 2:41:45.220]  a unique perspective of treating patients in all 50 states, and we started hearing the
[2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:49.860]  reports of vaccine injuries back in as far as February, so I would have thought it would
[2:41:49.860 --> 2:41:56.260]  have surely been pulled by like April or March, I mean, April or May, based on all the bad
[2:41:56.260 --> 2:41:58.140]  outcomes I was hearing about.
[2:41:58.140 --> 2:42:03.340]  So I was totally shocked and in awe that it became legal to start giving it to children.
[2:42:03.340 --> 2:42:10.940]  That's just complete insanity because children have basically 0.0001% risk of dying from COVID.
[2:42:10.940 --> 2:42:14.300]  It's like 1 in a million, it's so low.
[2:42:14.300 --> 2:42:17.580]  Their odds are better, you know, probably went in the lottery that I'm dying from COVID
[2:42:17.580 --> 2:42:23.700]  so why in the heck would you give your kid this dangerous poison when they have no risk
[2:42:23.700 --> 2:42:24.700]  really from COVID?
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:28.660]  Yeah, and I think that that's the ultimate question that's so hard but easy to answer
[2:42:28.660 --> 2:42:29.660]  at the same time.
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:31.500]  It's why would they be so desperate to do this to us?
[2:42:31.500 --> 2:42:34.060]  Why are they so desperate to put that vaccine in everybody's arm?
[2:42:34.060 --> 2:42:37.740]  It's not about saving lives, they don't give a damn about that, so there's obviously something
[2:42:37.740 --> 2:42:38.740]  else going on.
[2:42:38.740 --> 2:42:44.220]  Dr. Ben Marble, we thank you so much, MyFreeDoctor.com is the site where you can get more information
[2:42:44.220 --> 2:42:47.540]  and he'll help you get early treatment if you need it, folks.
[2:42:47.540 --> 2:42:48.540]  That's the answer to this.
[2:42:48.540 --> 2:42:52.700]  Yeah, there's a man-made virus going around but taking a poisonous vaccine is not the
[2:42:52.700 --> 2:42:53.700]  solution.
[2:42:53.700 --> 2:43:21.860]  Dr. Marble, thank you.
[2:43:21.860 --> 2:43:47.940]  Dr. Ben Marble, thank you so much.
[2:43:47.940 --> 2:44:17.900]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[2:44:17.900 --> 2:44:23.380]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[2:44:23.380 --> 2:44:26.340]  faces from the light of the sun.
[2:44:26.340 --> 2:44:34.420]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[2:44:34.420 --> 2:44:38.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[2:44:38.900 --> 2:44:41.900]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[2:44:41.900 --> 2:44:45.780]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[2:44:45.780 --> 2:44:48.580]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[2:44:48.580 --> 2:44:50.780]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[2:44:50.780 --> 2:44:54.140]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[2:44:54.140 --> 2:44:56.580]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[2:44:56.580 --> 2:45:01.140]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWarsLive products and that's
[2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:05.460]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never
[2:45:05.460 --> 2:45:10.460]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[2:45:10.460 --> 2:45:14.140]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[2:45:14.140 --> 2:45:17.980]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you this is next level.
[2:45:17.980 --> 2:45:19.300]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[2:45:19.300 --> 2:45:24.340]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:45:24.340 --> 2:45:29.260]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder and
[2:45:29.260 --> 2:45:33.900]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants and
[2:45:33.900 --> 2:45:37.260]  then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium and sodium
[2:45:37.260 --> 2:45:38.260]  added.
[2:45:38.260 --> 2:45:40.460]  I mean this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[2:45:40.460 --> 2:45:44.900]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch
[2:45:44.900 --> 2:45:47.140]  of sea salt and it just goes on and on.
[2:45:47.140 --> 2:45:52.700]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus available at 20% off and free shipping
[2:45:52.700 --> 2:45:55.700]  out of the gates at infowarsstore.com.

[2:46:58.740 --> 2:47:15.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:15.620 --> 2:47:20.420]  Folks, I gotta tell you, things are spiraling out of control so quickly.
[2:47:20.420 --> 2:47:21.420]  My head is spinning.
[2:47:21.420 --> 2:47:25.700]  I can't even possibly cover it all.
[2:47:25.700 --> 2:47:31.220]  I mean, you've got massive crime waves happening in almost every major city in the United States
[2:47:31.220 --> 2:47:34.980]  right now, specifically the ones that have been under Democrat rule for 50 plus years.
[2:47:34.980 --> 2:47:38.100]  I mean, it's just massive crime.
[2:47:38.100 --> 2:47:46.220]  I mean, theft every night, homicide every night, brutal assaults and beatings every night.
[2:47:46.220 --> 2:47:52.580]  And then you turn the page and it's, oh, they all get released from jail the next day.
[2:47:52.580 --> 2:47:56.260]  So-and-so assaulted 10 people downtown released from jail.
[2:47:56.260 --> 2:47:59.060]  So-and-so robbed two convenience stores released from jail.
[2:47:59.060 --> 2:48:07.300]  So-and-so had armed robbery and battery released from jail and it's just like, oh, okay.
[2:48:07.300 --> 2:48:08.500]  So that's not going to stop.
[2:48:08.500 --> 2:48:10.500]  So that's only going to get worse.
[2:48:10.500 --> 2:48:21.580]  And that's what I'm saying is I've got all these stacks of news here that's all important
[2:48:21.580 --> 2:48:24.780]  to cover and that's not even part of the coverage.
[2:48:24.780 --> 2:48:29.060]  It's like, yeah, massive crime rates, criminals being released from jail, which then increases
[2:48:29.060 --> 2:48:33.340]  the crime rates, which then they get sent to jail again, which then they become more hardened
[2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:35.740]  criminals and so they then commit harder crimes.
[2:48:35.740 --> 2:48:43.060]  And then eventually it's the same path to eventually just kill people.
[2:48:43.060 --> 2:48:50.180]  So that's what I'm saying is I could spend three hours on a talk show and I still wouldn't
[2:48:50.180 --> 2:48:57.820]  have enough time to cover the rampant crime wave happening in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
[2:48:57.820 --> 2:49:02.740]  New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore.
[2:49:02.740 --> 2:49:06.020]  There's just not even enough time in the day.
[2:49:06.020 --> 2:49:10.220]  And it's all Democrat leadership, Democrat judges, Democrat district attorneys that then
[2:49:10.220 --> 2:49:15.020]  let the criminals out of jail, write laws so that it's not even criminal, the offenses
[2:49:15.020 --> 2:49:17.140]  they're committing.
[2:49:17.140 --> 2:49:22.260]  And we just sit here and we're just told that though this is normal, watching your city
[2:49:22.260 --> 2:49:27.100]  get overrun by criminals every night, tuning into the local news, hearing about a homicide,
[2:49:27.100 --> 2:49:33.900]  hearing about retail, organized theft, train robberies, car jackings, beatings, rapes.
[2:49:33.900 --> 2:49:35.780]  You're just supposed to accept that that's normal.
[2:49:35.780 --> 2:49:37.700]  Oh, that's just normal.
[2:49:37.700 --> 2:49:40.860]  No, I refuse to accept that as normal.
[2:49:40.860 --> 2:49:42.020]  That is abnormal.
[2:49:42.020 --> 2:49:43.020]  That is evil.
[2:49:43.020 --> 2:49:44.820]  That is demented.
[2:49:44.820 --> 2:49:53.340]  That is the sign of a fallen civilization, a fallen economy, a fallen nation.
[2:49:53.340 --> 2:49:54.940]  Oh, yeah.
[2:49:54.940 --> 2:50:02.220]  You had two police officers in New York City shot over the weekend in an ambush style.
[2:50:02.220 --> 2:50:09.860]  You won't hear about that on the media, shot in the head, ambush style from the all cops
[2:50:09.860 --> 2:50:13.060]  are bad left that doesn't exist.
[2:50:13.060 --> 2:50:14.060]  They're not terrorists.
[2:50:14.060 --> 2:50:15.060]  Oh, they murder cops.
[2:50:15.060 --> 2:50:16.540]  They assault store owners.
[2:50:16.540 --> 2:50:17.540]  They rob every night.
[2:50:17.540 --> 2:50:18.540]  They burn.
[2:50:18.540 --> 2:50:19.540]  They loot.
[2:50:19.540 --> 2:50:20.540]  They kill.
[2:50:20.540 --> 2:50:21.540]  They destroy.
[2:50:21.540 --> 2:50:26.020]  They go up, not happening, none of it even exists.
[2:50:26.020 --> 2:50:33.780]  And then the police chief in New York City has a press conference with the Democrat mayor
[2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:37.700]  sitting next to him saying, we've had enough.
[2:50:37.700 --> 2:50:38.700]  We've had enough.
[2:50:38.700 --> 2:50:42.420]  Enough police officers being shot, enough crime, enough all this stuff.
[2:50:42.420 --> 2:50:46.060]  And it's like, you're standing next to the guy that represents the party that's done
[2:50:46.060 --> 2:50:47.380]  this to you.
[2:50:47.380 --> 2:50:51.420]  You're standing next to the guy that represents the Democrat party that's caused this massive
[2:50:51.420 --> 2:50:53.460]  crime wave.
[2:50:53.460 --> 2:51:01.640]  So oh, and not to mention specifically in New York, you're now alienating the only group
[2:51:01.640 --> 2:51:06.620]  of people in this country that actually support you when you go around arresting young children
[2:51:06.620 --> 2:51:10.380]  for not wearing a mask and not having a vaccine passport.
[2:51:10.380 --> 2:51:15.700]  So when you go and have a press conference because two of your officers just got shot,
[2:51:15.700 --> 2:51:20.180]  one of them assassinated in ambush style and you're begging the public for help with the
[2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:25.660]  Democrat mayor there next to you, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be rude or insensitive,
[2:51:25.660 --> 2:51:29.300]  but that is a losing message.
[2:51:29.300 --> 2:51:34.300]  That is a losing approach.
[2:51:34.300 --> 2:51:40.620]  Call out the Democrat party for what they've done to New York and quit harassing law abiding
[2:51:40.620 --> 2:51:48.100]  citizens that don't want to take a medical experimental forced vaccine and don't want
[2:51:48.100 --> 2:51:51.140]  to put a mask over their face because they want to breathe air.
[2:51:51.140 --> 2:51:53.980]  Sorry, you're going to lose.
[2:51:53.980 --> 2:51:56.140]  So guess what?
[2:51:56.140 --> 2:52:00.260]  There's going to be more police officers murdered in New York City before the end of the year.
[2:52:00.260 --> 2:52:04.300]  There's going to be more rampant crime waves happening in Democrat run cities before the
[2:52:04.300 --> 2:52:08.060]  end of the year and people are just going to shrug their shoulders and say, oh, I don't
[2:52:08.060 --> 2:52:12.660]  know what's going on, but it needs to stop.
[2:52:12.660 --> 2:52:15.860]  I'm sick of it.
[2:52:15.860 --> 2:52:19.820]  And so that's why people are leaving these Democrat run cities and droves and just moving
[2:52:19.820 --> 2:52:26.460]  out to small communities in flyover country as the liberals like to call it because you
[2:52:26.460 --> 2:52:27.460]  know what?
[2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:35.020]  People want to live in communities that aren't ravaged by crime and corruption.
[2:52:35.020 --> 2:52:42.300]  People are sick of being told to get used to record homicide rates, record car jackings,
[2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:48.620]  record beatings, record assaults, record number of criminals released onto the streets.
[2:52:48.620 --> 2:52:50.540]  We're sick of it.
[2:52:50.540 --> 2:52:54.980]  And this is what the Democrat Party wants you to think is normal.
[2:52:54.980 --> 2:52:58.260]  So that's what I'm saying is I didn't even plan to do this and the crew is just pouring
[2:52:58.260 --> 2:53:01.100]  through all the videos, pouring through all the headlines.
[2:53:01.100 --> 2:53:07.940]  I mean, seriously, it's just hundreds of people get murdered in Democrat run cities every
[2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:08.940]  day.
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:13.700]  They're black and the media doesn't even bat an eye because they want you to consider
[2:53:13.700 --> 2:53:17.740]  that to be normal.
[2:53:17.740 --> 2:53:24.780]  So it's like, oh, well, but I don't even have time to cover that because I've got the stack
[2:53:24.780 --> 2:53:29.660]  of medical tyranny news in front of me where now they're going to be expanding the use
[2:53:29.660 --> 2:53:35.900]  of Remdesivir, which is not just a failed treatment.
[2:53:35.900 --> 2:53:39.940]  It's known to kill people on the CDC website.
[2:53:39.940 --> 2:53:42.740]  They talk about the deadly side effects of Remdesivir.
[2:53:42.740 --> 2:53:44.820]  I've had the doctors on and explain it.
[2:53:44.820 --> 2:53:51.940]  And then I have to open up CNN and they say, the FDA is going to expand eligibility for
[2:53:51.940 --> 2:53:52.940]  Remdesivir.
[2:53:52.940 --> 2:53:54.940]  Oh, that's great.
[2:53:54.940 --> 2:54:03.900]  Good, let's just let's just kill more people with our medical treatment.
[2:54:03.900 --> 2:54:09.500]  Let's just let's just watch the let's just watch US cities have more crime and more theft
[2:54:09.500 --> 2:54:12.860]  and more death and more poverty and more desolation.
[2:54:12.860 --> 2:54:15.940]  Let's just watch it all happen and we'll call it normal.
[2:54:15.940 --> 2:54:21.220]  Build back better.
[2:54:21.220 --> 2:54:23.500]  You can't even walk on the streets.
[2:54:23.500 --> 2:54:29.340]  Oh, the it was a it was a prime minister of something of Ukraine today.
[2:54:29.340 --> 2:54:31.460]  Oh, that's another stack of news.
[2:54:31.460 --> 2:54:37.980]  Developments happening overseas where Joe Biden wants to send five to 10,000 US soldiers
[2:54:37.980 --> 2:54:42.120]  as bait and cannon fodder for Russia.
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:44.940]  Think about how sick that is.
[2:54:44.940 --> 2:54:54.260]  Joe Biden wants to send US citizens into the Baltic regions as a as a direct confrontation
[2:54:54.260 --> 2:54:56.660]  and bait for Putin.
[2:54:56.660 --> 2:55:00.060]  And he and I'm going to tell you what's sick about this, folks.
[2:55:00.060 --> 2:55:02.860]  Biden wants Putin to engage our soldiers.
[2:55:02.860 --> 2:55:07.420]  Biden and the Democrats and the New World Order probably want our our soldiers to go
[2:55:07.420 --> 2:55:12.820]  over there and get shot because that would give them the excuse to start the next World
[2:55:12.820 --> 2:55:14.820]  War.
[2:55:14.820 --> 2:55:20.660]  We should not send a single person anywhere near Russia right now.
[2:55:20.660 --> 2:55:22.580]  And they've already decided they're going to send weapons.
[2:55:22.580 --> 2:55:25.340]  Blinken announced that the other day.
[2:55:25.340 --> 2:55:33.180]  Think about how sick that is, that our our political leaders want to send our men and
[2:55:33.180 --> 2:55:41.580]  women as bait, as human bait, hoping that Russia would go out there and shoot one of
[2:55:41.580 --> 2:55:46.020]  them so that they can have an intervention.
[2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:47.700]  That is sick.
[2:55:47.700 --> 2:55:49.820]  That is evil.
[2:55:49.820 --> 2:55:51.180]  That's our political leadership.
[2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:56.040]  That is how sick and twisted and corrupt and evil DC has become, folks.
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:55:57.660]  And guess what, though?
[2:55:57.660 --> 2:56:00.220]  Everybody knows it now.
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:01.700]  Everybody knows it.
[2:56:01.700 --> 2:56:06.380]  Now, I've got to stop right there because we've got to fund this transmission.
[2:56:06.380 --> 2:56:08.940]  And if I don't plug, we're not going to be here tomorrow.
[2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:14.140]  And as Dr. Marble said and others now realize, if info wars is not on the air, folks, this
[2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:17.360]  critical information is not getting out.
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:19.980]  There's other good news outlets out there, but they don't have the reach.
[2:56:19.980 --> 2:56:21.940]  They don't have the capabilities we have.
[2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:24.060]  They don't have the experience, quite frankly.
[2:56:24.060 --> 2:56:25.140]  They don't have the foresight.
[2:56:25.140 --> 2:56:28.580]  So we need to keep info wars on air now more than ever.
[2:56:28.580 --> 2:56:34.260]  Shop at infowarstore.com to do so, whether it's emergency food supplies that are 10%
[2:56:34.260 --> 2:56:39.140]  off right now, whether it's the great vitamins that we have like vitamin C plus zinc or the
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:44.860]  whole food multivitamin 40% off, or the hats or the t-shirts or the air filters or the
[2:56:44.860 --> 2:56:51.220]  water filters or the coffee or all the other great stuff at infowarstore.com.
[2:56:51.220 --> 2:56:52.860]  That's how we stay on air.
[2:56:52.860 --> 2:56:57.340]  No, we're not like vice news that gets billions of dollars from their billionaire donors
[2:56:57.340 --> 2:56:58.340]  to exist.
[2:56:58.340 --> 2:57:03.180]  No, we're funded by our audience and we thank you for keeping us on air.
[2:57:03.180 --> 2:57:07.020]  And so that's why we amplify the hearing from Ron Johnson.
[2:57:07.020 --> 2:57:11.540]  That's why we cover all the news that nobody else will talk about because we know that
[2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:13.540]  that's our role.
[2:57:13.540 --> 2:57:16.820]  And that's why we get all the great guests on that gets censored and banned everywhere
[2:57:16.820 --> 2:57:19.180]  else because they tell the truth.
[2:57:19.180 --> 2:57:26.140]  So shop at infowarstore.com, keep us on the air, Gerald Salente takes over here on the
[2:57:26.140 --> 2:57:32.060]  fourth hour and then I'll be right back in this seat to host the war room from 3 to 6
[2:57:32.060 --> 2:57:33.060]  p.m.
[2:57:33.060 --> 2:57:35.620]  And I'll try to get all this news and video clips off the desk, but there's just so much
[2:57:35.620 --> 2:57:36.620]  going on folks.
[2:57:36.620 --> 2:57:43.420]  I mean, just an unbelievable time to be alive, but what a righteous act to fight this evil
[2:57:43.420 --> 2:57:47.420]  world scene.
[2:57:47.420 --> 2:57:51.260]  Hey info warriors, if you're like me, you've been a long time listener of this program
[2:57:51.260 --> 2:57:53.980]  and you've fed up with everything going on in the world.
[2:57:53.980 --> 2:57:58.620]  Inside you, like me, a fire is burning, something needs to change.
[2:57:58.620 --> 2:58:03.940]  And yet we feel helpless, almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created
[2:58:03.940 --> 2:58:04.940]  for us.
[2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:07.100]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[2:58:07.100 --> 2:58:09.740]  Race at Wars is a game changer.
[2:58:09.740 --> 2:58:14.860]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[2:58:14.860 --> 2:58:20.220]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy, and makes us depressed
[2:58:20.220 --> 2:58:22.980]  and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[2:58:22.980 --> 2:58:27.860]  When they feel their lie sheet steel plan to enslave and rob the people, there is an
[2:58:27.860 --> 2:58:28.860]  awakening.
[2:58:28.860 --> 2:58:35.020]  Race at Wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep rooted
[2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:38.100]  psychological tactics that were being used against me.
[2:58:38.100 --> 2:58:40.100]  And now I'm not scared anymore.
[2:58:40.100 --> 2:58:45.180]  I have to say, I was blown away, I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[2:58:45.180 --> 2:58:49.500]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together, you're absolutely right.
[2:58:49.500 --> 2:58:55.300]  We are reflections of God, we are emanations of that, and we can use that God energy to
[2:58:55.300 --> 2:58:58.020]  do really anything we want to do in this life.
[2:58:58.020 --> 2:59:02.540]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[2:59:02.540 --> 2:59:03.740]  And that's a process.
[2:59:03.740 --> 2:59:06.820]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[2:59:06.820 --> 2:59:10.460]  As people go through their day and don't think about many things, you can drive along a long
[2:59:10.460 --> 2:59:12.820]  journey and not even remember half the trip.
[2:59:12.820 --> 2:59:18.500]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[2:59:18.500 --> 2:59:20.260]  that subconscious mind.
[2:59:20.260 --> 2:59:24.740]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind, because there's a war on for our
[2:59:24.740 --> 2:59:25.740]  mind.
[2:59:25.740 --> 2:59:26.740]  He's exactly right.
[2:59:26.740 --> 2:59:31.140]  And he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening.
[2:59:31.140 --> 2:59:36.140]  And I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com.
[2:59:36.140 --> 2:59:38.140]  That's where your journey begins.
[3:00:06.140 --> 3:00:31.140]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:48.980]  The NIH guidelines for the treatment of hospitalized patients for COVID include Remdesivir and
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:01:12.980]  Lodos dexamethasone.
[3:01:12.980 --> 3:01:19.620]  The POM study group investigated four drugs for the use of Ebola.
[3:01:19.620 --> 3:01:27.940]  The results were published December the 12th, 2019 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[3:01:27.940 --> 3:01:34.820]  And that date is particularly important because that signaled the beginning of COVID.
[3:01:34.820 --> 3:01:43.860]  The Data Safety Monitoring Board of that study terminated the study of Remdesivir.
[3:01:43.860 --> 3:01:51.780]  Terminated because Remdesivir increased the risks of death and renal failure.
[3:01:51.780 --> 3:02:01.260]  It was such a toxic drug, the Data Safety Monitoring Board terminated the use of Remdesivir.
[3:02:01.260 --> 3:02:11.660]  That in January and February of 2021, the NIH and the Act 1 study enrolled patients in a
[3:02:11.660 --> 3:02:18.860]  study looking at Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19.
[3:02:18.860 --> 3:02:24.860]  The last patient was enrolled April 19, 2020.
[3:02:24.860 --> 3:02:33.500]  Ten days later, before the study had actually terminated, Dr. Fauci sat in the Oval Office
[3:02:33.500 --> 3:02:41.020]  of the White House and he said the trial was good news.
[3:02:41.020 --> 3:02:47.740]  What Dr. Fauci did not tell you was that the primary endpoint of the study was changed
[3:02:47.740 --> 3:02:50.700]  halfway during the study.
[3:02:50.700 --> 3:02:57.340]  We all know that is scientific misconduct because the study was not going to be positive.
[3:02:57.340 --> 3:03:00.260]  They changed the primary endpoint.
[3:03:00.260 --> 3:03:07.980]  The original endpoint was an eight-point ordinal scale that included death and the requirement
[3:03:07.980 --> 3:03:10.900]  for mechanical ventilation.
[3:03:10.900 --> 3:03:16.940]  Knowing that Remdesivir would not affect those endpoints, they invented a bogus endpoint
[3:03:16.940 --> 3:03:24.540]  called time to recovery, which they showed in this study was statistically significant
[3:03:24.540 --> 3:03:38.340]  and based on this bogus endpoint, Remdesivir was approved by the FDA on October 20, 2020.
[3:03:38.340 --> 3:03:43.780]  If one does a meta-analysis looking at the studies of Remdesivir, the two studies which
[3:03:43.780 --> 3:03:49.140]  were sponsored by Gilead show a reduction in mortality.
[3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:55.940]  However, if you look at the four independent studies, including the large study by the
[3:03:55.940 --> 3:04:00.660]  WHO, it shows the opposite effect.
[3:04:00.660 --> 3:04:04.620]  Remdesivir increases the risk of death.
[3:04:04.620 --> 3:04:06.460]  Let me say that again.
[3:04:06.460 --> 3:04:12.900]  Remdesivir increases the risk of death by 3%.
[3:04:12.900 --> 3:04:18.300]  It increases your chances of renal failure by 20%.
[3:04:18.300 --> 3:04:21.180]  This is a toxic drug.
[3:04:21.180 --> 3:04:29.620]  But just to make the situation even more preposterous, the federal government will give hospitals
[3:04:29.620 --> 3:04:41.140]  a 20% bonus on the entire hospital bill if they prescribe Remdesivir to Medicare patients.
[3:04:41.140 --> 3:04:50.740]  The federal government is incentivizing hospitals to prescribe a medication which is toxic.
[3:05:11.140 --> 3:05:19.300]  We're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[3:05:19.300 --> 3:05:21.660]  deindustrialization great reset.
[3:05:21.660 --> 3:05:25.940]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[3:05:25.940 --> 3:05:30.540]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[3:05:30.540 --> 3:05:33.820]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but
[3:05:33.820 --> 3:05:35.620]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:05:35.620 --> 3:05:38.380]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[3:05:38.380 --> 3:05:43.420]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:43.420 --> 3:05:47.420]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[3:05:47.420 --> 3:05:48.900]  to ship right now.
[3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:53.780]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits
[3:05:53.780 --> 3:05:56.260]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:05:56.260 --> 3:06:09.780]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:06:09.780 --> 3:06:15.500]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:06:15.500 --> 3:06:20.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:06:20.620 --> 3:06:26.420]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:06:26.420 --> 3:06:28.500]  Well, that was some video.
[3:06:28.500 --> 3:06:29.500]  Wow.
[3:06:29.500 --> 3:06:34.300]  You know, everybody get this in your head.
[3:06:34.300 --> 3:06:36.060]  You don't call them big pharma.
[3:06:36.060 --> 3:06:39.980]  You only call them big pharma if you're a moron or an imbecile.
[3:06:39.980 --> 3:06:42.820]  They're drug dealers.
[3:06:42.820 --> 3:06:44.500]  You like the opioid crisis?
[3:06:44.500 --> 3:06:47.540]  Is that your favorite?
[3:06:47.540 --> 3:06:51.780]  Look what they're doing.
[3:06:51.780 --> 3:06:58.860]  There's not one allotropic drug on the market that cures a chronic degenerative disease.
[3:06:58.860 --> 3:06:59.860]  Not one.
[3:06:59.860 --> 3:07:10.420]  But yet you tune on the Cartoon News Network, ABC, CNN, CBS, if you know what, yep, one
[3:07:10.420 --> 3:07:12.740]  drug ad after another.
[3:07:12.740 --> 3:07:20.220]  And you could thank that murderous piece of lowlife, garbage, scum crap, Bill Clinton
[3:07:20.220 --> 3:07:23.820]  for making that happen back in 1997.
[3:07:23.820 --> 3:07:26.460]  They weren't allowed to put these drug ads on.
[3:07:26.460 --> 3:07:36.460]  So going back to that, we just saw that video about how the FDA and the government is stealing
[3:07:36.460 --> 3:07:45.620]  out on money to give a drug injections and stuff to people that are killing them.
[3:07:45.620 --> 3:07:52.620]  You know, look who the guy with a clown, the arrogant little boy that used to be the FDA
[3:07:52.620 --> 3:07:55.940]  director under Trump.
[3:07:55.940 --> 3:07:57.940]  Scott Gottlieb.
[3:07:57.940 --> 3:08:00.460]  Scott Gottlieb.
[3:08:00.460 --> 3:08:04.140]  Where did Gottlieb go?
[3:08:04.140 --> 3:08:09.140]  Scott Gottlieb, where did Gottlieb leave after he left the FDA?
[3:08:09.140 --> 3:08:15.260]  Oh, you mean he's on the board of directors of Pfizer?
[3:08:15.260 --> 3:08:18.380]  What am I, six years old?
[3:08:18.380 --> 3:08:21.820]  How stupid can you be?
[3:08:21.820 --> 3:08:27.620]  And there's another clown there bringing in a cat lift, whatever his name is.
[3:08:27.620 --> 3:08:31.300]  Another guy totally tied into the drug companies.
[3:08:31.300 --> 3:08:37.980]  And now you know the big news, Pfizer's CEO to Israeli TV.
[3:08:37.980 --> 3:08:41.140]  World should be back to near normal in a few months.
[3:08:41.140 --> 3:08:50.140]  Albert Barola says U.S.-based pharma firm is aiming to produce annual shot.
[3:08:50.140 --> 3:08:55.100]  You got it, an annual shot.
[3:08:55.100 --> 3:08:56.100]  There he is.
[3:08:56.100 --> 3:09:01.620]  That shot made about 20 something million dollars last year.
[3:09:01.620 --> 3:09:04.100]  And what did Pfizer make, like 37 billion?
[3:09:04.100 --> 3:09:06.620]  Oh, the vaccines are free.
[3:09:06.620 --> 3:09:07.620]  Grow up.
[3:09:07.620 --> 3:09:08.620]  They're not free.
[3:09:08.620 --> 3:09:11.220]  They stole our money to give it to the drug dealers.
[3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:16.540]  And Pfizer gave Biden one million dollars to celebrate his inauguration.
[3:09:16.540 --> 3:09:19.220]  That was the maximum they could give.
[3:09:19.220 --> 3:09:21.820]  They're bribes and payoffs.
[3:09:21.820 --> 3:09:31.500]  In an interview with Israeli television, Pfizer CEO Barola predicted, quote, once a
[3:09:31.500 --> 3:09:36.460]  year it is easier to convince people to do it.
[3:09:36.460 --> 3:09:45.420]  It is easier for people to remember talking about producing a once a year vaccine.
[3:09:45.420 --> 3:09:48.820]  Yep.
[3:09:48.820 --> 3:09:56.540]  Once a year, this is the scum that shot off his arrogant mouth that all the prostitutes
[3:09:56.540 --> 3:10:00.820]  swallow the crap shooting out of his mouth.
[3:10:00.820 --> 3:10:08.820]  Oh, this vaccine, 96% efficacy rate after two shots.
[3:10:08.820 --> 3:10:09.820]  That's right.
[3:10:09.820 --> 3:10:11.660]  Go back to November, December, 2020.
[3:10:11.660 --> 3:10:15.860]  Again, we write about it in detail in the Trends Journal.
[3:10:15.860 --> 3:10:16.860]  Two shots.
[3:10:16.860 --> 3:10:19.740]  Two shots is all you need.
[3:10:19.740 --> 3:10:21.380]  And now it's an annual.
[3:10:21.380 --> 3:10:22.860]  This is like the flu shot.
[3:10:22.860 --> 3:10:24.460]  Yeah, you get the flu shot.
[3:10:24.460 --> 3:10:25.460]  It may kill you.
[3:10:25.460 --> 3:10:26.460]  It won't kill the flu.
[3:10:26.460 --> 3:10:27.460]  But that's all right.
[3:10:27.460 --> 3:10:30.100]  We'll make a lot of dough doing it and steal your money.
[3:10:30.100 --> 3:10:34.980]  Like the crap they're saying, oh, Biden's sending out, you know, free test kits, free
[3:10:34.980 --> 3:10:35.980]  masks.
[3:10:35.980 --> 3:10:37.420]  They're not free.
[3:10:37.420 --> 3:10:44.820]  They tax pay your money and our money goes to the scum that they're buying them from that
[3:10:44.820 --> 3:10:51.980]  they get kickbacks called campaign contributions.
[3:10:51.980 --> 3:10:54.820]  The virus will not be eradicated.
[3:10:54.820 --> 3:10:58.140]  This virus will be with us for years to come.
[3:10:58.140 --> 3:11:07.580]  But we should be able to come back to normal lives in a few months.
[3:11:07.580 --> 3:11:14.100]  He's stressed there will be abnormally abnormalities such as Omicron that we will be able to control.
[3:11:14.100 --> 3:11:15.900]  You haven't been able to control that one.
[3:11:15.900 --> 3:11:22.780]  How are you going to be able to control this one?
[3:11:22.780 --> 3:11:29.540]  Yep.
[3:11:29.540 --> 3:11:33.620]  And listen to this.
[3:11:33.620 --> 3:11:40.260]  Barola also told the network that he's regularly targeted by anti-vaccine activists who post
[3:11:40.260 --> 3:11:43.220]  false information about him online.
[3:11:43.220 --> 3:11:50.580]  Not about being a lying little jerk, I'm not a lying jerk, or maybe you're just a jerk
[3:11:50.580 --> 3:11:53.820]  because you said it had a 96% efficacy rate.
[3:11:53.820 --> 3:11:58.780]  Oh, and how about all that other BS that they were shooting out there?
[3:11:58.780 --> 3:12:05.100]  That when the herd was immunotized by 70%, that's the crap that shot out of that mouth
[3:12:05.100 --> 3:12:08.500]  Fauci's mouth and we wouldn't have to worry.
[3:12:08.500 --> 3:12:18.580]  And what do you got, countries like Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, highly vaccinated
[3:12:18.580 --> 3:12:26.140]  and whoof, whoof, whoof, case after case, Fauci, the arrogant little jerk, the highest
[3:12:26.140 --> 3:12:28.140]  paid public servant.
[3:12:28.140 --> 3:12:29.140]  What public servant?
[3:12:29.140 --> 3:12:31.620]  We're the servants.
[3:12:31.620 --> 3:12:45.780]  Anyway, he goes on to say, differentiating the sizable minority of people who are hesitant
[3:12:45.780 --> 3:12:56.620]  to take the vaccine, Barola said that, quote, there is a tiny minority of people who profit
[3:12:56.620 --> 3:13:01.700]  from circulating misinformation.
[3:13:01.700 --> 3:13:09.420]  Hey freak face, I don't profit from circulating information.
[3:13:09.420 --> 3:13:19.660]  It's misinformation that you're shooting out that the people are buying.
[3:13:19.660 --> 3:13:23.420]  They know very well everything.
[3:13:23.420 --> 3:13:28.820]  They just make it a way of living to circulate this misinformation.
[3:13:28.820 --> 3:13:30.220]  You ready?
[3:13:30.220 --> 3:13:31.860]  They are criminals.
[3:13:31.860 --> 3:13:33.420]  He's calling us criminals.
[3:13:33.420 --> 3:13:36.220]  You hear that Alex Jones?
[3:13:36.220 --> 3:13:39.820]  You hear that Joe McCollough?
[3:13:39.820 --> 3:13:42.860]  You hear that RFK Junior?
[3:13:42.860 --> 3:13:45.140]  We're criminals.
[3:13:45.140 --> 3:13:50.540]  This is a criminal act that he is speaking.
[3:13:50.540 --> 3:13:53.540]  This should be stopped.
[3:13:53.540 --> 3:13:56.100]  This is treacherous.
[3:13:56.100 --> 3:13:58.260]  Why isn't he being called out?
[3:13:58.260 --> 3:14:05.740]  I'll tell you why, because the low life politicians got cojones smaller than mothballs and they're
[3:14:05.740 --> 3:14:11.260]  getting paid off by this criminal.
[3:14:11.260 --> 3:14:16.300]  He said anti-vaxxers falsely claimed his wife had died, blah, blah, blah.
[3:14:16.300 --> 3:14:18.420]  But that's the least of the damage.
[3:14:18.420 --> 3:14:22.340]  The biggest thing is because people believe those things.
[3:14:22.340 --> 3:14:27.260]  People who died are predominantly not vaccinated, Barola said.
[3:14:27.260 --> 3:14:30.500]  Millions of people have died because of them.
[3:14:30.500 --> 3:14:33.820]  These small numbers are criminals.
[3:14:33.820 --> 3:14:35.820]  Oh we're criminals.
[3:14:35.820 --> 3:14:41.260]  Hey freak face, how are we criminals?
[3:14:41.260 --> 3:14:45.060]  You got vaccinated, you're safe.
[3:14:45.060 --> 3:14:46.060]  Everybody got vaccinated.
[3:14:46.060 --> 3:14:48.900]  Oh remember this woman, I wonder if she died.
[3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:51.500]  You never saw her anymore, the first one.
[3:14:51.500 --> 3:14:53.740]  She was the first one that went down.
[3:14:53.740 --> 3:14:56.780]  Hey Hank Aaron, bye, bye.
[3:14:56.780 --> 3:14:58.780]  How many else are gone?
[3:14:58.780 --> 3:15:02.740]  Oh no, you'll be fine.
[3:15:02.740 --> 3:15:03.740]  You'll be fine.
[3:15:03.740 --> 3:15:06.980]  A little, little jerk over there doing the hand signals.
[3:15:06.980 --> 3:15:11.540]  Yeah, this woman, I wonder what really happened to her.
[3:15:11.540 --> 3:15:15.740]  And then when you watch it later on, they're all just standing around there, whacking off.
[3:15:15.740 --> 3:15:27.180]  Yeah, there you go, they're just whacking off, don't know what to do.
[3:15:27.180 --> 3:15:29.500]  Millions of people have died because of them.
[3:15:29.500 --> 3:15:33.620]  No, no, millions of people have died because of you.
[3:15:33.620 --> 3:15:35.860]  Nobody talks about natural healing.
[3:15:35.860 --> 3:15:38.580]  Nobody talks about building up your immune system.
[3:15:38.580 --> 3:15:42.580]  Nobody.
[3:15:42.580 --> 3:15:44.740]  So that's what's going on.
[3:15:44.740 --> 3:15:45.740]  We're going to be right back.
[3:15:45.740 --> 3:15:57.660]  By the way, the markets going down big, we'll be back in a bit, thank you.
[3:15:57.660 --> 3:16:02.460]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight.
[3:16:02.460 --> 3:16:04.860]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[3:16:04.860 --> 3:16:09.380]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[3:16:09.380 --> 3:16:13.980]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[3:16:13.980 --> 3:16:17.260]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that shield, you know, with a deep burden
[3:16:17.260 --> 3:16:21.340]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it and man, in two weeks
[3:16:21.340 --> 3:16:26.900]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could
[3:16:26.900 --> 3:16:31.780]  think again, I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[3:16:31.780 --> 3:16:36.140]  years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[3:16:36.140 --> 3:16:38.020]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[3:16:38.020 --> 3:16:42.460]  The one I like recently is knockout, it literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[3:16:42.460 --> 3:16:43.460]  It's amazing.
[3:16:43.460 --> 3:16:47.500]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean, we have to break free of
[3:16:47.500 --> 3:16:51.660]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own
[3:16:51.660 --> 3:16:52.660]  hand.
[3:16:52.660 --> 3:16:53.660]  Beautifully said brother.
[3:16:53.660 --> 3:16:57.860]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[3:16:57.860 --> 3:17:03.260]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[3:17:03.260 --> 3:17:05.300]  a healthier life.
[3:17:05.300 --> 3:17:09.140]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[3:17:09.140 --> 3:17:10.740]  that contains both.
[3:17:10.740 --> 3:17:15.740]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[3:17:15.740 --> 3:17:17.340]  from the infowars store.
[3:17:17.340 --> 3:17:22.140]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[3:17:22.140 --> 3:17:24.860]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:29.700]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[3:17:29.700 --> 3:17:34.380]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[3:17:34.380 --> 3:17:35.380]  shown.
[3:17:35.380 --> 3:17:39.660]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[3:17:39.660 --> 3:17:44.300]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:17:44.300 --> 3:17:49.380]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[3:17:49.380 --> 3:17:50.380]  like here in America.
[3:17:50.380 --> 3:17:55.220]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise
[3:17:55.220 --> 3:18:24.220]  our rose hips don't lie.

[3:19:44.780 --> 3:19:48.060]  I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[3:19:48.060 --> 3:19:49.060]  don't work.
[3:19:49.060 --> 3:19:58.860]  You can go to infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:19:58.860 --> 3:20:23.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:23.620 --> 3:20:36.940]  And now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:20:36.940 --> 3:20:43.340]  Great being on the Alex Jones show and everybody listening, remember, do all you can to support
[3:20:43.340 --> 3:20:44.340]  Infowars.
[3:20:44.340 --> 3:20:50.100]  They have great products and they're selling products that not only help keep the program
[3:20:50.100 --> 3:20:55.780]  going but they keep you going too, they're good for your health and we'll talk more
[3:20:55.780 --> 3:20:56.780]  about them.
[3:20:56.780 --> 3:21:04.580]  But in the meantime, go to infowarsstores.com and get what you need and they get these great,
[3:21:04.580 --> 3:21:08.820]  great products, a lot of them back in stock, 40, 50% off.
[3:21:08.820 --> 3:21:13.460]  So order them now, you're going to need them because things are going to get very, very
[3:21:13.460 --> 3:21:19.780]  difficult in the times ahead and there's globalist destabilization, they have an emergency sale
[3:21:19.780 --> 3:21:26.180]  where you get 10% off all storeable foods and storeable foods may become a very important
[3:21:26.180 --> 3:21:31.660]  thing because we're going down big and we're going down hard and you also have some great
[3:21:31.660 --> 3:21:36.940]  brain force plus products and a powerful, clean, effective brain boost and that's back
[3:21:36.940 --> 3:21:42.740]  in stock, 40% off, vitamin C plus zinc and I'm a big fan of those.
[3:21:42.740 --> 3:21:49.700]  I take 18 supplements a day, not sure, more than that, I take 18 once and I take six more
[3:21:49.700 --> 3:21:51.180]  in midday.
[3:21:51.180 --> 3:21:56.760]  So I believe in building my immune system up and getting strong and healthy and infowars
[3:21:56.760 --> 3:22:02.980]  has a lot of life select products that can help you do that and you're really going to
[3:22:02.980 --> 3:22:07.180]  need it now because things are going to go down big, they're going to go down bad, they're
[3:22:07.180 --> 3:22:10.540]  going to go down hard and they're going down fast.
[3:22:10.540 --> 3:22:17.540]  So do what you can to support infowars, again, a lot of products back in stock, 40, 50% off,
[3:22:17.540 --> 3:22:21.140]  they'll order them now and keep the truth alive.
[3:22:21.140 --> 3:22:35.660]  So going back to where we left off about with this guy, Barola, he got a $1 million deal,
[3:22:35.660 --> 3:22:46.300]  an award coming out with his vaccine that now is going to have to be every year and
[3:22:46.300 --> 3:22:50.980]  again, you look at the people that are getting the virus and the baloney that they say is
[3:22:50.980 --> 3:22:54.020]  that hopefully to get vaccinated, I would have been a lot sicker.
[3:22:54.020 --> 3:23:01.500]  Yeah, say that Jack and Jill got to be equal now, get a million bucks this clown got, arrogant
[3:23:01.500 --> 3:23:06.340]  boy, an arrogant boy.
[3:23:06.340 --> 3:23:21.340]  So the markets today, before I go on to that, this guy Barola, now we have New York Governor
[3:23:21.340 --> 3:23:29.060]  Huckle says making kids wear masks is like making them wear sneakers.
[3:23:29.060 --> 3:23:37.820]  I mentioned this to illustrate the stupid ignorant morons, the imbeciles that are running
[3:23:37.820 --> 3:23:43.380]  and ruining our lives.
[3:23:43.380 --> 3:23:48.500]  Dressing how school districts are abandoning school COVID mask mandates, New York Governor
[3:23:48.500 --> 3:23:58.500]  Katie Huckle said that making kids wear masks is like making them wear sneakers.
[3:23:58.500 --> 3:24:03.460]  First they object, then they comply.
[3:24:03.460 --> 3:24:09.780]  Huckle said that kids will eventually submit to mask mandates because they adapt better
[3:24:09.780 --> 3:24:11.740]  than adults do.
[3:24:11.740 --> 3:24:23.780]  Hey, a idiot, a idiot, a idiot, a moron, a imbecile.
[3:24:23.780 --> 3:24:29.700]  They adapt better than adults do their kids.
[3:24:29.700 --> 3:24:37.420]  Maybe you think like a kid, you must, you've been, you've been a politician all your life.
[3:24:37.420 --> 3:24:43.020]  Of course you think like a kid.
[3:24:43.020 --> 3:24:48.060]  Huckle said that kids will eventually submit to mask mandates because they adapt better
[3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:54.180]  than adults do, comparing being required to wear masks to being told to wear sneakers.
[3:24:54.180 --> 3:25:00.780]  Quote, my daughter had a meltdown over having to put sneakers on to go to kindergarten.
[3:25:00.780 --> 3:25:03.740]  She got used to wearing sneakers in school.
[3:25:03.740 --> 3:25:09.860]  Could you imagine the stupidity of this, what the hell do I care about your kid wanting
[3:25:09.860 --> 3:25:12.940]  to wear sneakers and not wearing them?
[3:25:12.940 --> 3:25:18.420]  You're bringing that in and making that a comparison.
[3:25:18.420 --> 3:25:21.460]  Look how they're freaking these kids out.
[3:25:21.460 --> 3:25:28.300]  It freaked out before, now they're more freaked out.
[3:25:28.300 --> 3:25:33.180]  And I'm really proud of the parents that make sure that their kids understood this is really
[3:25:33.180 --> 3:25:35.780]  for their safety and got it done.
[3:25:35.780 --> 3:25:42.140]  Okay, imbeciles, all you imbeciles that believe this crap, of course you're not listening
[3:25:42.140 --> 3:25:50.940]  because you're on infowars, but all the ones that aren't listening, here's the data.
[3:25:50.940 --> 3:25:59.620]  There are 74 million, 74 million people in the United States between the ages of one
[3:25:59.620 --> 3:26:03.500]  to 17.
[3:26:03.500 --> 3:26:16.820]  In two years, 693, not excuse me, from January 2020 to January 6, 2022, the grand total of
[3:26:16.820 --> 3:26:31.780]  that 74 million that died allegedly of the virus are 693, out of 74 million.
[3:26:31.780 --> 3:26:38.620]  Hey, Huckle, maybe you're too damn stupid to know what those numbers mean.
[3:26:38.620 --> 3:26:44.500]  They mean nothing because when you break down that number, according to the Centers of
[3:26:44.500 --> 3:26:58.580]  Disease Control and Prevention, 61% of that 693 that died were obese, yeah.
[3:26:58.580 --> 3:27:08.420]  Oh, they won't wear sneakers, but they'll eat crap food, particularly the crap that
[3:27:08.420 --> 3:27:15.100]  you shove down their throat in the public schools, blow them up, blow them up, blip
[3:27:15.100 --> 3:27:22.060]  them out, feed them crap, don't get healthy.
[3:27:22.060 --> 3:27:25.740]  These are the idiots and morons running and ruining our lives.
[3:27:25.740 --> 3:27:27.660]  This thing's going down big.
[3:27:27.660 --> 3:27:28.860]  This thing's going down hard.
[3:27:28.860 --> 3:27:32.780]  You see the markets today, they were down over 1,000 points.
[3:27:32.780 --> 3:27:33.780]  That's right.
[3:27:33.780 --> 3:27:35.980]  And what did I write?
[3:27:35.980 --> 3:27:38.620]  Oh, sent it right out of way.
[3:27:38.620 --> 3:27:41.700]  Watch for the plunge protection team to come in.
[3:27:41.700 --> 3:27:42.700]  Watch for the plunge protect.
[3:27:42.700 --> 3:27:52.460]  Yeah, here we go, America, America, limped out, bloated out, 42% of Americans are obese,
[3:27:52.460 --> 3:27:56.060]  70% are overweight.
[3:27:56.060 --> 3:27:57.260]  That's right.
[3:27:57.260 --> 3:27:58.460]  Only Mexico got a speed.
[3:27:58.460 --> 3:27:59.460]  They got 73%.
[3:27:59.460 --> 3:28:05.860]  No, excuse me, 40% are obese, 72% are overweight, Mexico's 73% are overweight.
[3:28:05.860 --> 3:28:18.100]  Keep eating crap, don't get healthy, only a vaccine will save you and drugs.
[3:28:18.100 --> 3:28:20.660]  This is terrible.
[3:28:20.660 --> 3:28:24.180]  They're not stopping this, but here's the good news.
[3:28:24.180 --> 3:28:29.180]  My forecast, the COVID war is going to come to an end.
[3:28:29.180 --> 3:28:35.220]  That's right, late March, mid-April, this thing's going to be over.
[3:28:35.220 --> 3:28:40.100]  And then it's going to be climate change is going to get you, climate change is going
[3:28:40.100 --> 3:28:44.300]  to get you, and the markets are going to get you, and when we come back, we're going to
[3:28:44.300 --> 3:28:52.100]  talk about the markets, where they're going, what's next, what to do, how to prepare and
[3:28:52.100 --> 3:28:53.100]  prevail.
[3:28:53.100 --> 3:29:01.860]  Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular products are
[3:29:01.860 --> 3:29:02.860]  back in stock.
[3:29:02.860 --> 3:29:08.300]  Whole food multivitamin, a central nutrient multivitamin from natural, healthy sources,
[3:29:08.300 --> 3:29:13.780]  not synthetic, and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic Linus Pauling Nobel
[3:29:13.780 --> 3:29:18.140]  Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your body.
[3:29:18.140 --> 3:29:24.100]  They're both back in stock sold out for more than four months at 40% off.
[3:29:24.100 --> 3:29:28.860]  Another reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep
[3:29:28.860 --> 3:29:29.860]  us on air.
[3:29:29.860 --> 3:29:37.420]  So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food multivitamin
[3:29:37.420 --> 3:29:39.380]  and take vitamin C and take zinc.
[3:29:39.380 --> 3:29:43.100]  And we also have some great vitamin D products at m4store.com as well.
[3:29:43.100 --> 3:29:48.060]  But whatever you do to fend your body's immune system, we want to keep patriots in the game
[3:29:48.060 --> 3:29:49.060]  against the new world order.
[3:29:49.060 --> 3:29:53.380]  So it's a 360 win, it's something essential for your body and your health and your longevity
[3:29:53.380 --> 3:29:57.580]  and your immune system while funding the info war at infowarstore.com.
[3:29:57.580 --> 3:29:58.940]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:29:58.940 --> 3:30:00.980]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:30:00.980 --> 3:30:01.980]  Welcome.
[3:30:01.980 --> 3:30:02.980]  Hello, Alex.
[3:30:02.980 --> 3:30:03.980]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:30:03.980 --> 3:30:04.980]  All right.
[3:30:04.980 --> 3:30:06.980]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[3:30:06.980 --> 3:30:11.860]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[3:30:11.860 --> 3:30:14.620]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[3:30:14.620 --> 3:30:15.620]  Mix those two together.
[3:30:15.620 --> 3:30:17.220]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:30:17.220 --> 3:30:19.180]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[3:30:19.180 --> 3:30:24.100]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[3:30:24.100 --> 3:30:29.700]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[3:30:29.700 --> 3:30:30.700]  but just aren't as strong.
[3:30:30.700 --> 3:30:32.700]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:30:32.700 --> 3:30:35.100]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:30:35.100 --> 3:30:37.100]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:30:37.100 --> 3:30:40.380]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[3:30:40.380 --> 3:30:41.380]  strong?
[3:30:41.380 --> 3:30:42.380]  That's just how it is.
[3:30:42.380 --> 3:30:43.380]  It's how it works.
[3:30:43.380 --> 3:30:44.780]  So it's always good.
[3:30:44.780 --> 3:30:46.900]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:30:46.900 --> 3:30:57.620]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:30:57.620 --> 3:30:58.980]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:30:58.980 --> 3:31:01.020]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:31:01.020 --> 3:31:02.020]  Welcome.
[3:31:02.020 --> 3:31:03.020]  Hello, Alex.
[3:31:03.020 --> 3:31:04.020]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:31:04.020 --> 3:31:05.020]  All right.
[3:31:05.020 --> 3:31:07.020]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[3:31:07.020 --> 3:31:11.900]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[3:31:11.900 --> 3:31:17.620]  Vitality and Brainforce Plus, mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[3:31:17.620 --> 3:31:19.220]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[3:31:19.220 --> 3:31:24.140]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[3:31:24.140 --> 3:31:29.740]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[3:31:29.740 --> 3:31:30.740]  but just aren't as strong.
[3:31:30.740 --> 3:31:32.740]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:31:32.740 --> 3:31:35.140]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:31:35.140 --> 3:31:37.140]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:31:37.140 --> 3:31:40.180]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[3:31:40.180 --> 3:31:41.180]  strong?
[3:31:41.180 --> 3:31:42.180]  Well, it is.
[3:31:42.180 --> 3:31:43.180]  It's how it works.
[3:31:43.180 --> 3:31:44.780]  So it's always good.
[3:31:44.780 --> 3:31:46.940]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:31:46.940 --> 3:31:57.780]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:31:57.780 --> 3:32:01.340]  Neutropics is a fancy way of saying brain pill.
[3:32:01.340 --> 3:32:07.060]  And it is the fastest growing market and supplements in the world for good reason.
[3:32:07.060 --> 3:32:12.580]  There are a lot of amazing compounds out there, some healthy, some not, that do incredible
[3:32:12.580 --> 3:32:14.340]  things in our brains.
[3:32:14.340 --> 3:32:18.780]  And we've tried them all, we've researched them all, and we will not sell you anything
[3:32:18.780 --> 3:32:23.780]  that is linked to any problems or any type of toxicity or any type of extreme hangovers.
[3:32:23.780 --> 3:32:27.860]  Because I'm not saying some of our brain products, you won't have a little bit of letdown once
[3:32:27.860 --> 3:32:29.380]  you take them, but that would just be a lie.
[3:32:29.380 --> 3:32:33.580]  But these are very, very clean with compounds that God gave us that are good for you.
[3:32:33.580 --> 3:32:38.980]  And one of our best sellers is back in stock, Brain Force Plus, a good, clean, Neutropic,
[3:32:38.980 --> 3:32:41.060]  a good, clean brain pill.
[3:32:41.060 --> 3:32:43.300]  You can find stuff that's stronger, but it's not good for you.
[3:32:43.300 --> 3:32:45.100]  This is a high quality system.
[3:32:45.100 --> 3:32:49.900]  It's available at InfoWarsTour.com, it's sold out for a long time at 40% off.

[3:32:58.460 --> 3:33:05.460]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:28.460 --> 3:33:31.740]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show at InfoWars.
[3:33:31.740 --> 3:33:36.940]  And I want to thank Alex and the staff for the great job that they do and all they do
[3:33:36.940 --> 3:33:42.900]  to help you as well, not only by providing you with information and analysis that you
[3:33:42.900 --> 3:33:46.980]  can't find anywhere else, but they had a great line of products.
[3:33:46.980 --> 3:33:53.220]  And again, in supporting InfoWars, you're supporting yourself as well as InfoWars because
[3:33:53.220 --> 3:33:58.420]  this is a time to build up your health, get in the best shape you can, physically, emotionally,
[3:33:58.420 --> 3:33:59.420]  and spiritually.
[3:33:59.420 --> 3:34:07.460]  And they have a great line of products to help you go to InfoWarsTours.com, InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:34:07.460 --> 3:34:19.220]  So I was talking about this Huckleberry over here, that's the governor of New York.
[3:34:19.220 --> 3:34:23.100]  This is from Friday's New York time.
[3:34:23.100 --> 3:34:31.220]  Real interest helped Huckle's campaign coffers swell quickly.
[3:34:31.220 --> 3:34:34.740]  See that all that underlying stuff, that's a crap I got to read, I have no line of salient
[3:34:34.740 --> 3:34:39.020]  points or articles I read.
[3:34:39.020 --> 3:34:47.420]  Anyway, let's see, 21 million bucks she got, 21 million bucks, and a lot of them from real
[3:34:47.420 --> 3:34:53.580]  estate agents because she's going to do a deal in New York and the donations include $200,000
[3:34:53.580 --> 3:35:01.740]  in checks from families behind major construction firms with millions in state contracts, $47,000
[3:35:01.740 --> 3:35:03.820]  was tied to a gaming giant.
[3:35:03.820 --> 3:35:09.740]  I believe her husband is a lobbyist for one, I'm not positive, but I believe that he's
[3:35:09.740 --> 3:35:14.900]  a lobbyist, one of the gaming gangs in New York.
[3:35:14.900 --> 3:35:24.780]  So let's get this straight everybody, 21.6 million bucks, how are you going to run against
[3:35:24.780 --> 3:35:25.780]  them?
[3:35:25.780 --> 3:35:27.900]  Where are you going to get the money?
[3:35:27.900 --> 3:35:37.980]  And you go over there to Illinois and the guy running over there, tell us his name,
[3:35:37.980 --> 3:35:46.580]  he starts with a P, I can't say the word because they made blackball me for saying it, but
[3:35:46.580 --> 3:35:47.580]  where is it?
[3:35:47.580 --> 3:35:56.460]  Pfizer, no not Pfizer, Pritzker, 90 million bucks out of his own pocket to run, 90 million.
[3:35:56.460 --> 3:36:03.460]  This is not a democracy, it's taken over by the gangs, the drug dealers that morons and
[3:36:03.460 --> 3:36:15.260]  imbeciles call Big Pharma, the military industrial complex, the banks, the bandits, and Big Tech.
[3:36:15.260 --> 3:36:21.860]  It's one big club and you ain't in it as George Carlin used to say, again, we're looking at
[3:36:21.860 --> 3:36:29.660]  the numbers here coming out, Disney's CEO pay more than doubled, the guy, Bob Chappick,
[3:36:29.660 --> 3:36:35.820]  $32.5 million in total compensation for 2021.
[3:36:35.820 --> 3:36:45.380]  The guy that they just got rid of their Iger, 45.9 million, oh, 0.9 million, it wasn't 46
[3:36:45.380 --> 3:36:48.460]  million, this is a year.
[3:36:48.460 --> 3:36:58.700]  And this is from Wall Street Journal, two top executives at Netflix, 39.3 million, 43.2
[3:36:58.700 --> 3:37:00.980]  million.
[3:37:00.980 --> 3:37:09.660]  The guy that backs the head over there, one of the Jamie Dimon gang, he only made 34.5
[3:37:09.660 --> 3:37:23.220]  million, the guy from Morgan Stanley, he made 33 million.
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:29.700]  You believe this, the world's 10 richest billionaires have doubled their wealth since the COVID-19
[3:37:29.700 --> 3:37:32.820]  war started in 2020.
[3:37:32.820 --> 3:37:38.660]  While we the people have saved land here, we're non-essentials, we get poorer.
[3:37:38.660 --> 3:37:43.860]  This is a takeover in front of our eyes.
[3:37:43.860 --> 3:37:52.700]  Your small business is non-essential, Walmart, that's essential.
[3:37:52.700 --> 3:37:54.900]  Home goods, that's essential.
[3:37:54.900 --> 3:37:59.660]  Home depot, that's essential.
[3:37:59.660 --> 3:38:10.980]  Costco is essential, Target is essential, mom and pop, you're not essential.
[3:38:10.980 --> 3:38:15.220]  And again, you got morons and imbeciles telling us what to do.
[3:38:15.220 --> 3:38:22.500]  All California school children must be vaccinated against COVID-19 on the new bill.
[3:38:22.500 --> 3:38:38.060]  Great Senator Richard Pan, yeah, Pan, how about Pan a crap, Pan, you little jerk, announce
[3:38:38.060 --> 3:38:50.580]  a bill that will require inoculations of attending kindergarten to 12, K to 12 schools.
[3:38:50.580 --> 3:38:57.540]  Again, I gave you the numbers, there's a copy of the transgender headline, Anthony Frieda
[3:38:57.540 --> 3:38:58.540]  does great work.
[3:38:58.540 --> 3:39:01.820]  And again, there's no magazine like this in the world.
[3:39:01.820 --> 3:39:07.460]  Last week was 149 pages, the week before 161 pages, again, we're going to go back to the
[3:39:07.460 --> 3:39:12.140]  markets in a little bit, but we're putting out nobody, there's no magazine like it.
[3:39:12.140 --> 3:39:16.940]  Geopolitics, economics, environment, high-tech science, one after another.
[3:39:16.940 --> 3:39:22.300]  You go to trendsjournal.com, trendsjournal.com, the history before it happens.
[3:39:22.300 --> 3:39:29.580]  And also, the Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice, freedompeacejustice.com,
[3:39:29.580 --> 3:39:34.700]  and we're providing vaccine religious exemptions, they're going great.
[3:39:34.700 --> 3:39:38.900]  And I just did a sermon last, it was on yesterday, it went up.
[3:39:38.900 --> 3:39:41.260]  So you might want to see that too.
[3:39:41.260 --> 3:39:45.780]  We're uniting people of all races, colors and creeds to live heaven on earth because
[3:39:45.780 --> 3:39:48.620]  they're turning it into hell on earth.
[3:39:48.620 --> 3:39:51.540]  So this is what's going on.
[3:39:51.540 --> 3:39:59.420]  And as I said over and over again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:39:59.420 --> 3:40:04.260]  You go back, there's a thing called the Great Depression.
[3:40:04.260 --> 3:40:05.260]  What followed it?
[3:40:05.260 --> 3:40:08.780]  Oh, World War II.
[3:40:08.780 --> 3:40:13.660]  Then let's fast forward to 9-11.
[3:40:13.660 --> 3:40:17.260]  Let's go back to 9-10.
[3:40:17.260 --> 3:40:28.460]  The NASDAQ was down 66% from its high of March 2000.
[3:40:28.460 --> 3:40:38.180]  You go back to your trendsjournal, October 1999, I had forecast that the dot-com bust
[3:40:38.180 --> 3:40:44.260]  would happen by the second quarter of 2000, and it did.
[3:40:44.260 --> 3:40:54.860]  Again, the markets are down, 9-11 happens, we're in a deep recession, people couldn't
[3:40:54.860 --> 3:41:01.420]  stand little arrogant Georgie Bush, a little nobody of a boy, a daddy's boy, another daddy's
[3:41:01.420 --> 3:41:08.420]  boy, born on third base and 30 at a home run, we're going to get that guy Osama bin Laden
[3:41:08.420 --> 3:41:11.940]  dead alive.
[3:41:11.940 --> 3:41:14.820]  In 88% of the people bought his BS.
[3:41:14.820 --> 3:41:19.940]  They forgot about the dot-com bust, ended the recession, they started the whole fake
[3:41:19.940 --> 3:41:22.660]  real estate boom.
[3:41:22.660 --> 3:41:28.300]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:41:28.300 --> 3:41:34.060]  And we're seeing it now, Biden ways deploying thousands of troops to Eastern Europe and
[3:41:34.060 --> 3:41:35.060]  the Baltics.
[3:41:35.060 --> 3:41:40.860]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea believe this little arrogant, stupid
[3:41:40.860 --> 3:41:43.300]  piece of crap?
[3:41:43.300 --> 3:41:44.300]  How could anybody?
[3:41:44.300 --> 3:41:46.900]  It's like a clown on a mad magazine.
[3:41:46.900 --> 3:41:50.540]  Most people don't remember mad magazine, but there was this character there that looked
[3:41:50.540 --> 3:42:00.180]  just like him, yeah, Alfred E. Newman, and that's who you got, and that's what we got.
[3:42:00.180 --> 3:42:06.900]  They're going to take us to war, they've been teaching us to hate Russia all my life when
[3:42:06.900 --> 3:42:12.220]  I was a little kid hiding under a desk in case an atom bomb went off.
[3:42:12.220 --> 3:42:16.340]  Same morons that have you wearing masks when you walk in a restaurant, you take them off
[3:42:16.340 --> 3:42:18.060]  when you sit down.
[3:42:18.060 --> 3:42:20.820]  The same ones that tell you you could take them off when you're eating and drinking on
[3:42:20.820 --> 3:42:24.220]  an airplane, you got to put them back on when you stop eating and drinking because that's
[3:42:24.220 --> 3:42:25.860]  when the virus comes.
[3:42:25.860 --> 3:42:30.620]  The same imbeciles, and they're doing it again.
[3:42:30.620 --> 3:42:34.820]  And now they're doing it with the teaching us to hate Russia more and more again, we
[3:42:34.820 --> 3:42:42.700]  write about the facts, how the Ukraine was overthrown by the United States of a democratically
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:49.820]  elected government back in 2013 with Victoria Nuland and John McCain.
[3:42:49.820 --> 3:42:56.940]  We're going to be back in a little bit, stay tuned and remember, support Infowars.
[3:42:56.940 --> 3:42:59.940]  Reset wars is the key.

[3:43:04.340 --> 3:43:09.740]  It really dives deeper into yourself and into the bigger picture that doesn't necessarily
[3:43:09.740 --> 3:43:15.220]  go across political lines or religious lines, but about all of us as a human species coming
[3:43:15.220 --> 3:43:16.220]  together.
[3:43:16.220 --> 3:43:21.900]  I'm a combat veteran and that brought me close to God, but what Alex goes through brought
[3:43:21.900 --> 3:43:23.020]  me even closer.
[3:43:23.020 --> 3:43:24.700]  I can feel God in my life now.
[3:43:24.700 --> 3:43:29.100]  The viruses that Alex talks to you about that are subconsciously programmed into your brain

[3:46:58.860 --> 3:47:16.980]  Waging a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:16.980 --> 3:47:21.820]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente.
[3:47:21.820 --> 3:47:32.100]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:32.100 --> 3:47:35.900]  You know, I was taught before, I was talking about how the politicians are in control of
[3:47:35.900 --> 3:47:36.900]  this country.
[3:47:36.900 --> 3:47:40.420]  And it's really not the politicians, it's the big corporations.
[3:47:40.420 --> 3:47:43.180]  I'm showing you what the kind of money these guys are making.
[3:47:43.180 --> 3:47:47.780]  I gave you the money the banksters are making, like Jamie Dimon and the others.
[3:47:47.780 --> 3:47:52.340]  Go back to not too long ago, it was called the Panic of 08.
[3:47:52.340 --> 3:48:00.380]  And remember, we, the people of slave landia, we had to bail them out because they were
[3:48:00.380 --> 3:48:02.260]  too big to fail.
[3:48:02.260 --> 3:48:03.260]  That's right.
[3:48:03.260 --> 3:48:16.380]  They caused the crash with their derivatives and their subprime mortgages and all the dirty
[3:48:16.380 --> 3:48:18.660]  dealing that they did.
[3:48:18.660 --> 3:48:27.380]  The Federal Reserve, which isn't federal, it's a private bank, they pumped $29 trillion
[3:48:27.380 --> 3:48:33.700]  into the banksters between 2007 and 2010, according to the leading institute of Bard
[3:48:33.700 --> 3:48:35.380]  College.
[3:48:35.380 --> 3:48:39.180]  And look at the money that these guys are making.
[3:48:39.180 --> 3:48:45.380]  While everybody else, median household income at its biggest drop in 2020, ever, and it
[3:48:45.380 --> 3:48:46.940]  keeps going lower.
[3:48:46.940 --> 3:48:50.860]  The bigs keep getting bigger and the rich are running the deal.
[3:48:50.860 --> 3:49:01.540]  I mentioned the Illinois governor, self-fundered J.B. Pritzker made the contribution $90 million
[3:49:01.540 --> 3:49:05.300]  check, $90 million.
[3:49:05.300 --> 3:49:13.420]  Then we had another BS Bloomberg over here in New York.
[3:49:13.420 --> 3:49:14.420]  Look what he did.
[3:49:14.420 --> 3:49:21.940]  He ran for Democratic, going to go for president.
[3:49:21.940 --> 3:49:24.340]  And what happened with him?
[3:49:24.340 --> 3:49:27.780]  Almost a billion dollars he spent.
[3:49:27.780 --> 3:49:29.940]  Almost a billion dollars.
[3:49:29.940 --> 3:49:32.260]  This isn't a democracy.
[3:49:32.260 --> 3:49:35.260]  Get it in your head.
[3:49:35.260 --> 3:49:38.260]  It's fascism.
[3:49:38.260 --> 3:49:44.420]  Go by the definition of a guy by the name of Benito Mussolini.
[3:49:44.420 --> 3:49:49.460]  Yeah, not an Italian that I like, but there's a lot of Italians that I don't like.
[3:49:49.460 --> 3:49:51.420]  Fauci being one of them.
[3:49:51.420 --> 3:49:53.420]  Cuomo being another.
[3:49:53.420 --> 3:49:57.900]  Draghi another when they clown over there is Bloomberg.
[3:49:57.900 --> 3:50:00.300]  Almost a billion dollars he spends.
[3:50:00.300 --> 3:50:04.140]  And what do they give back to society, these people?
[3:50:04.140 --> 3:50:06.980]  Nothing of any value.
[3:50:06.980 --> 3:50:11.660]  Nothing of any value, just crap.
[3:50:11.660 --> 3:50:19.780]  So going back, and when you're looking what's happened, a guy like this Pritzker, and I think
[3:50:19.780 --> 3:50:26.740]  they spelt it wrong, that gets his PRIC, they put a TZ in there, but I think another letter
[3:50:26.740 --> 3:50:35.700]  goes in there because that's who he is, a little nobody, a balloon of a guy.
[3:50:35.700 --> 3:50:46.180]  Again, Mussolini said it, fascism, the merger of state and corporate powers.
[3:50:46.180 --> 3:50:52.740]  As a matter of fact, I believe Pritzker's sister was the commerce secretary also under
[3:50:52.740 --> 3:50:58.140]  the Obama administration, and they own a big hotel chain.
[3:50:58.140 --> 3:51:00.140]  I forgot the name of it.
[3:51:00.140 --> 3:51:04.420]  It's, I want to say maybe Hyatt, it's one of those.
[3:51:04.420 --> 3:51:09.740]  Look at this guy, this guy, this guy telling me what to do, this guy telling me what to
[3:51:09.740 --> 3:51:19.420]  do, look at him, look at him.
[3:51:19.420 --> 3:51:27.740]  Going back to where we're going, again, in the trends journal, we have been warning
[3:51:27.740 --> 3:51:31.180]  that when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:51:31.180 --> 3:51:37.980]  Wars of Chinese warplanes flying near Taiwan after U.S. Japan showed that of naval might,
[3:51:37.980 --> 3:51:45.340]  that's CNN headline, naval might, what might, you might as well forget it, hey, America,
[3:51:45.340 --> 3:51:53.180]  you couldn't win a war over there in Afghanistan after 20 years.
[3:51:53.180 --> 3:51:57.100]  You lost in Iraq, couldn't win in Vietnam, oh yeah, if we bought more of them, only killed
[3:51:57.100 --> 3:52:01.700]  20 million, we killed 30 million, we couldn't win, we could have won.
[3:52:01.700 --> 3:52:10.620]  You're not going to fight the Chinese.
[3:52:10.620 --> 3:52:17.340]  Some 90 tons of U.S. lethal aid has arrived in Ukraine and the tensions over Russia's
[3:52:17.340 --> 3:52:21.660]  troop buildup on the border.
[3:52:21.660 --> 3:52:32.580]  When they show this article here, Russia deploys troops in Belarus, okay, Russia deploys troops
[3:52:32.580 --> 3:52:43.940]  in Belarus, Pentagon puts on high alert, 8,500 troops, what are you going to fight?
[3:52:43.940 --> 3:52:50.220]  They're doing this to get the people's mind off the COVID war and the economic destruction
[3:52:50.220 --> 3:52:52.020]  that's happened.
[3:52:52.020 --> 3:53:00.140]  You're not going to beat Russia, you're not going to beat China, what are you doing over
[3:53:00.140 --> 3:53:01.140]  there?
[3:53:01.140 --> 3:53:06.860]  Oh, how dare Russia deploys troops in neighboring Belarus when America is what, in 70 different
[3:53:06.860 --> 3:53:09.380]  countries with 800 bases?
[3:53:09.380 --> 3:53:14.900]  What the hell are we still doing in Okinawa, in Italy, in Germany?
[3:53:14.900 --> 3:53:20.100]  And you're talking about where are all the religious, where are the Catholics, where
[3:53:20.100 --> 3:53:24.620]  are the Jews, where are the Muslims, where are the Buddhists, where are all the people
[3:53:24.620 --> 3:53:27.460]  protesting for peace?
[3:53:27.460 --> 3:53:29.460]  Where are they?
[3:53:29.460 --> 3:53:38.580]  Where are they, Pope, when you're not selling vaccines, Pope, Pope and dope, and I'm a Catholic,
[3:53:38.580 --> 3:53:42.100]  he doesn't represent the Jesus Christ that I believe in.
[3:53:42.100 --> 3:53:46.980]  Yeah, my Jesus Christ, oh, when you go to heaven, if you get a vaccination, maybe that's
[3:53:46.980 --> 3:53:49.460]  your Jesus Christ, huh?
[3:53:49.460 --> 3:53:51.500]  How come they're not talking about this?
[3:53:51.500 --> 3:53:57.700]  Not a peep, but we are at the universal church of freedom, peace and justice.
[3:53:57.700 --> 3:54:01.860]  We are on a war path of war.
[3:54:01.860 --> 3:54:04.500]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:54:04.500 --> 3:54:07.100]  You need any more proof?
[3:54:07.100 --> 3:54:17.020]  Again, the Great Depression, World War II, the dot-com bust, the war on terror.
[3:54:17.020 --> 3:54:20.780]  Yeah, terrible.
[3:54:20.780 --> 3:54:22.860]  Look what they did to our lives.
[3:54:22.860 --> 3:54:24.500]  Look how they destroyed us.
[3:54:24.500 --> 3:54:26.740]  Look how they robbed us of our freedom.
[3:54:26.740 --> 3:54:29.660]  And look how they robbed us of our freedom with the COVID war.
[3:54:29.660 --> 3:54:36.460]  When this war breaks out, we've lost all our freedom.
[3:54:36.460 --> 3:54:41.620]  Where are the religions?
[3:54:41.620 --> 3:54:47.980]  Where are the religions?
[3:54:47.980 --> 3:54:53.980]  How come they're not protesting this?
[3:54:53.980 --> 3:54:58.140]  Moscow has denied any plans to attack or invade Ukraine.
[3:54:58.140 --> 3:55:02.660]  U.S. President Joe Biden approved the $200 million security support package.
[3:55:02.660 --> 3:55:04.140]  What $200 million?
[3:55:04.140 --> 3:55:06.900]  $200 million of our money.
[3:55:06.900 --> 3:55:09.980]  Oh, yeah.
[3:55:09.980 --> 3:55:19.980]  These projects get $27 billion in fundraising, over five years.
[3:55:19.980 --> 3:55:21.820]  What are we talking about?
[3:55:21.820 --> 3:55:24.060]  Next to nothing.
[3:55:24.060 --> 3:55:25.060]  Next to nothing.
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:32.020]  Oh, but $10 billion in test kits and $200 million plus the $3 billion going to Israel
[3:55:32.020 --> 3:55:33.020]  every year.
[3:55:33.020 --> 3:55:36.980]  Oh, Tel Aviv is the richest country in the world to live in, a city in the world the
[3:55:36.980 --> 3:55:41.260]  most expensive, and we're spending money on this?
[3:55:41.260 --> 3:55:44.820]  Bring the money, bring the troops back to America.
[3:55:44.820 --> 3:55:50.220]  No foreign entanglements, mind your own business.
[3:55:50.220 --> 3:55:57.940]  Oh, world's longest high-speed railway network to get longer.
[3:55:57.940 --> 3:56:05.180]  China plans to extend the length of its high-speed railway network by 50,000 kilometers, 31,000
[3:56:05.180 --> 3:56:07.180]  miles by 2025.
[3:56:07.180 --> 3:56:12.260]  Oh, they're going to expand it by 31,000 miles.
[3:56:12.260 --> 3:56:13.260]  And what do we have?
[3:56:13.260 --> 3:56:16.820]  About a mile and a half in America?
[3:56:16.820 --> 3:56:17.820]  You've been on Amtrak?
[3:56:17.820 --> 3:56:21.500]  Hey, how about the New York subway system?
[3:56:21.500 --> 3:56:23.100]  How about a night in Calcutta?
[3:56:23.100 --> 3:56:29.460]  They're giving our money to the military industrial complex, to the banksters, to big
[3:56:29.460 --> 3:56:34.020]  tech, and the drug dealers.
[3:56:34.020 --> 3:56:38.740]  If we don't stand up and fight for freedom, peace, and justice, it's over.
[3:56:38.740 --> 3:56:40.380]  This thing's going down big.
[3:56:40.380 --> 3:56:42.140]  You can see it.
[3:56:42.140 --> 3:56:48.180]  And the morons buy it, again, dumb enough to believe Bush's wars, dumb enough to believe
[3:56:48.180 --> 3:56:54.820]  the COVID war, and dumb enough to believe Biden's war.
[3:56:54.820 --> 3:57:01.460]  And the people will buy it the same way they marched off to Mussolini, saluted Stalin, and
[3:57:01.460 --> 3:57:06.460]  hiled Hitler, they'll do it again unless we stop them.
[3:57:06.460 --> 3:57:11.220]  And Info Wars is doing what they can, and we, too, at the Trends Journal are doing what
[3:57:11.220 --> 3:57:13.220]  we can.
[3:57:13.220 --> 3:57:19.900]  And again, for consideration for religious exemption, and they've been working great,
[3:57:19.900 --> 3:57:29.460]  and tune into our services, freedompeacejustice.com, freedompeacejustice.com, imagine we own that
[3:57:29.460 --> 3:57:35.460]  domain name, shows you how few people care about freedom, peace, and justice.
[3:57:35.460 --> 3:57:41.300]  So do your cancer support Info Wars, and we're going to be back next week, and keep your
[3:57:41.300 --> 3:57:42.300]  eye open.
[3:57:42.300 --> 3:57:54.300]  Inside you, like me, fire is burning, something needs to change.
[3:57:54.300 --> 3:57:58.460]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to reset wars.
[3:57:58.460 --> 3:57:59.460]  It's really powerful.
[3:57:59.460 --> 3:58:04.940]  Reset wars was absolutely amazing, and eye-opening, and revolutionary.
[3:58:04.940 --> 3:58:10.060]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[3:58:10.060 --> 3:58:12.060]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[3:58:12.060 --> 3:58:14.140]  I found it to be awesome.
[3:58:14.140 --> 3:58:15.500]  It was worth it to me.
[3:58:15.500 --> 3:58:21.580]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[3:58:21.580 --> 3:58:22.580]  trust.
[3:58:22.580 --> 3:58:23.580]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[3:58:23.580 --> 3:58:30.260]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information
[3:58:30.260 --> 3:58:35.460]  and experiences, and understanding that the power structure is censoring, and is definitely
[3:58:35.460 --> 3:58:36.460]  afraid of.
[3:58:36.460 --> 3:58:41.260]  To think the way we are intended to think by God, that's what this series is about.
[3:58:41.260 --> 3:58:46.340]  Reset wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty, and it has rejuvenated
[3:58:46.340 --> 3:58:47.980]  my hope.
[3:58:47.980 --> 3:58:51.900]  It's been helping me a lot, with a lot that's going on in my life.
[3:58:51.900 --> 3:58:55.980]  He needs to purchase this product, and watch it, and then share the information far and
[3:58:55.980 --> 3:58:56.980]  wide.
[3:58:56.980 --> 3:58:57.980]  There is an awakening.
[3:58:57.980 --> 3:59:03.340]  Join in to help yourself, and others, to wake up.
[3:59:03.340 --> 3:59:09.460]  Reset wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know, and also learn
[3:59:09.460 --> 3:59:10.460]  new material.
[3:59:10.460 --> 3:59:11.460]  I'm not disappointed.
[3:59:11.460 --> 3:59:13.940]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[3:59:13.940 --> 3:59:17.740]  I hear you coming more and more with that, and I feel it more and more.
[3:59:17.740 --> 3:59:18.740]  It's moving me.
[3:59:18.740 --> 3:59:23.220]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission, and I felt like
[3:59:23.220 --> 3:59:25.780]  I got a lot of that from reset wars as well.
[3:59:25.780 --> 3:59:30.020]  The confidence and hope gained from reset wars is priceless.
[3:59:30.020 --> 3:59:31.380]  This isn't magic.
[3:59:31.380 --> 3:59:37.540]  This is the real code of the universe, or what Max Plank 120-plus years ago called the
[3:59:37.540 --> 3:59:54.740]  Matrix.
