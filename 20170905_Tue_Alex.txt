[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  We've got it, we've got it, got it.
[00:01.400 --> 00:03.440]  Think there's been a coming to you.
[00:07.120 --> 00:09.320]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:09.320 --> 00:11.440]  All right, you have gold.
[00:11.440 --> 00:16.120]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines
[00:16.120 --> 00:17.240]  of the Info War.
[00:19.720 --> 00:22.400]  Are we seeing the air?
[00:22.400 --> 00:25.400]  You've got it, you've got it.
[00:25.400 --> 00:27.240]  Are we seeing the air?
[00:27.240 --> 00:29.720]  Well, close to four weeks ago, the controlled
[00:29.720 --> 00:35.680]  corporate enemy media, the globalist media,
[00:35.680 --> 00:37.680]  came out and acted like it was the end of the world.
[00:37.680 --> 00:40.640]  And President Trump decried the white supremacists,
[00:40.640 --> 00:45.680]  as well as the anti-fugs.
[00:45.680 --> 00:47.240]  And then three weeks later, he was totally
[00:47.240 --> 00:50.240]  vindicated when we saw all across the country them
[00:50.240 --> 00:54.200]  savagely beating and attacking innocent prayer
[00:54.200 --> 00:59.320]  vigils, free speech rallies, land rights events,
[00:59.320 --> 01:02.760]  second amendment events, you name it.
[01:02.760 --> 01:07.320]  That blew up squarely in Nancy Pelosi, Maxinewater,
[01:07.320 --> 01:10.880]  Michael Mores, and other people's faces.
[01:10.880 --> 01:13.760]  Now, they're acting like the Dreamer Act,
[01:13.760 --> 01:18.040]  put in place by Obama, used to flood the United States
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.360]  with people, on average, 30 years of age,
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.960]  calling illegal aliens dreamers when they couldn't
[01:26.960 --> 01:29.520]  document when they actually got here.
[01:29.520 --> 01:32.200]  It's been used for massive fraud.
[01:32.200 --> 01:34.840]  That's what the facts show.
[01:34.840 --> 01:38.080]  The truth is, Trump is planning to try to get reform in that
[01:38.080 --> 01:42.760]  makes it easier for people that have come here legally
[01:42.760 --> 01:45.960]  to get working permits and to be in the United States.
[01:45.960 --> 01:51.960]  And I've got three people working in my office right now
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.720]  who are from Mexico and who work here legally and lawfully
[01:57.720 --> 01:58.960]  and they do a great job.
[01:58.960 --> 02:02.880]  And they're on their way to be citizens down the road.
[02:02.880 --> 02:07.280]  So this isn't about not letting people
[02:07.280 --> 02:09.520]  be in the country who aren't from here.
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.600]  It's about having basic laws that at least match up
[02:14.600 --> 02:17.720]  with the average laws in the world.
[02:17.720 --> 02:20.880]  Because globalism is trying to end our sovereignty.
[02:20.880 --> 02:23.280]  And the big corporations want cheap labor.
[02:23.280 --> 02:25.440]  And the Democrats want a political pool.
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.120]  They can put chips on the shoulders
[02:27.120 --> 02:29.680]  and create massive division.
[02:29.680 --> 02:33.160]  So this is a giant exercise in the media,
[02:33.160 --> 02:35.560]  picking some of the people that are here
[02:35.560 --> 02:38.800]  and would qualify for the Dreamer Act, who
[02:38.800 --> 02:40.920]  do speak three or four or five languages, who really
[02:40.920 --> 02:44.640]  are doing a great job, who really are EMTs,
[02:44.640 --> 02:45.880]  who really are good people.
[02:45.880 --> 02:48.600]  No one's denying that.
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.200]  Immigrants are some of the best workers
[02:50.200 --> 02:51.520]  and smartest folks we've got.
[02:51.520 --> 02:53.880]  Because America's been so free and so wealthy.
[02:53.880 --> 02:55.640]  A lot of Americans, I don't care if they're Black,
[02:55.640 --> 02:58.720]  White, Hispanic, or Asian, have gotten lazy.
[02:58.720 --> 02:59.800]  And the statistics show that.
[02:59.800 --> 03:04.480]  So I hire immigrants because they work hard on average.
[03:04.480 --> 03:06.080]  I guess the cliche is true.
[03:06.080 --> 03:09.240]  But within that cliche, there's a large group of criminals
[03:09.240 --> 03:12.440]  that are above the law because we become lawless in this country.
[03:12.440 --> 03:15.800]  And that minority of criminals is creating
[03:15.800 --> 03:17.720]  a disproportionate amount of crime.
[03:17.720 --> 03:19.960]  And no one can debate that.
[03:19.960 --> 03:22.760]  And so all the whining and all the screaming
[03:22.760 --> 03:26.240]  and all the gnashing of teeth is nothing but hype.
[03:26.240 --> 03:28.360]  I can't go to Brazil.
[03:28.360 --> 03:30.720]  I can't go to Mexico.
[03:30.720 --> 03:31.920]  I can't go to Russia.
[03:31.920 --> 03:33.000]  I can't go to China.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.720]  I can't go to Nigeria.
[03:34.720 --> 03:37.640]  I can't go to Japan.
[03:37.640 --> 03:40.720]  And say I've lived there for 20 years,
[03:40.720 --> 03:42.800]  and suddenly they just make you a citizen when
[03:42.800 --> 03:45.920]  you came there illegally or make you legal.
[03:45.920 --> 03:49.400]  Now here is the Attorney General talking about this.
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.640]  Today, and then we'll be back with the big news on North Korea.
[03:56.440 --> 03:57.800]  Good morning.
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.040]  I'm here today to announce that the program known as DACA
[04:02.040 --> 04:05.640]  that was effectuated under the Obama administration
[04:05.640 --> 04:07.240]  is being rescinded.
[04:07.240 --> 04:10.640]  The DACA program was implemented in 2012
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.920]  and essentially provided a legal status for recipients
[04:14.920 --> 04:19.320]  for a renewable two-year term, worker authorization,
[04:19.320 --> 04:22.640]  and other benefits, including participation
[04:22.640 --> 04:27.720]  in the Social Security program to 800,000 mostly adult
[04:27.720 --> 04:29.520]  illegal aliens.
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.120]  The policy was implemented unilaterally
[04:32.120 --> 04:34.920]  to great controversy and legal concern
[04:34.920 --> 04:38.320]  after Congress rejected legislative proposals
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.400]  to extend similar benefits on numerous occasions
[04:42.400 --> 04:47.080]  to this same group of illegal aliens.
[04:47.080 --> 04:52.680]  And that's all this is, is Trump reasserting our sovereignty?
[04:52.680 --> 04:56.600]  And the media is trying to turn reality upside down
[04:56.600 --> 04:57.680]  and act like this is evil.
[05:03.800 --> 05:05.760]  We've got great air filters, great water filters,
[05:05.760 --> 05:08.480]  great non-GMO, early on seeds, great books, great films,
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.640]  great patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[05:10.640 --> 05:14.400]  And we've got a new humongoid sale, not a number of things
[05:14.400 --> 05:16.600]  that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[05:16.600 --> 05:18.880]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months,
[05:18.880 --> 05:21.320]  we've never offered super male vitality,
[05:21.320 --> 05:23.640]  known concentrated herbs, cold pressed,
[05:23.640 --> 05:26.520]  super male vitality, 57% off.
[05:26.520 --> 05:28.200]  It's never been the price.
[05:28.200 --> 05:32.480]  It is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total
[05:32.480 --> 05:34.560]  by third party sides, unprecedented.
[05:34.560 --> 05:35.800]  And it's cold pressed.
[05:35.800 --> 05:37.760]  That's why super male is so different.
[05:37.760 --> 05:39.560]  People say, well, I know these compounds work
[05:39.560 --> 05:40.720]  because it's admitted to science.
[05:40.720 --> 05:42.680]  These are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said,
[05:42.680 --> 05:44.080]  it's like there's already best selling stuff
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.120]  that's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.480]  Why these aren't anything new?
[05:47.480 --> 05:49.120]  Cause why do something new
[05:49.120 --> 05:51.640]  when you can have the oldest and best, but cold pressed?
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.480]  Do, do.
[05:59.360 --> 06:00.640]  As most of you already know,
[06:00.640 --> 06:03.960]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[06:03.960 --> 06:06.680]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more
[06:06.680 --> 06:09.520]  research, I came across the fact that the elite
[06:09.520 --> 06:12.120]  establishment is fully aware of the fact
[06:12.120 --> 06:14.600]  that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[06:14.600 --> 06:17.080]  had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.320]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[06:20.320 --> 06:22.800]  of the animals that they were hunting, killing,
[06:22.800 --> 06:23.760]  and then processing.
[06:23.760 --> 06:26.360]  And so I set out to develop caveman,
[06:26.360 --> 06:29.960]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[06:29.960 --> 06:34.840]  but seven other super food ingredients known for cleansing
[06:34.840 --> 06:37.720]  and super charging the body at the same time.
[06:37.720 --> 06:40.120]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist.
[06:40.120 --> 06:43.600]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face
[06:43.600 --> 06:46.320]  of the complete media assault and winning
[06:46.320 --> 06:47.960]  because of your support.

[07:58.120 --> 08:15.120]  MUSIC
[08:16.120 --> 08:21.120]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[08:21.120 --> 08:24.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:24.120 --> 08:28.120]  MUSIC
[08:28.120 --> 08:34.120]  It is already the fifth day of September 2017.
[08:34.120 --> 08:36.120]  MUSIC
[08:36.120 --> 08:38.120]  Coming up, Vladimir Putin.
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.120]  MUSIC
[08:40.120 --> 08:44.120]  The South Korean president as well, the Japanese president
[08:44.120 --> 08:48.120]  and our own Pentagon all agree the world has never been closer
[08:48.120 --> 08:51.120]  to thermal nuclear war as it is right now.
[08:51.120 --> 08:54.120]  We're going to go over the latest developments
[08:54.120 --> 08:57.120]  with the crisis of crises.
[08:57.120 --> 09:00.120]  Nuclear armed North Korea with hydrogen bombs
[09:00.120 --> 09:04.120]  threatening all out nuclear war against their neighbors.
[09:04.120 --> 09:06.120]  How long will the world sit here
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.120]  while this threat continues to expand
[09:09.120 --> 09:12.120]  and can North Korea be reasoned with
[09:12.120 --> 09:15.120]  back from the edge of the abyss
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.120]  that megalomania and globalist appeasement
[09:19.120 --> 09:22.120]  has led us all to?
[09:24.120 --> 09:29.120]  First off, I want to get into the secrets of the DREAM Act
[09:29.120 --> 09:34.120]  and DACA's recension by the president today.
[09:34.120 --> 09:37.120]  The president is following the law.
[09:37.120 --> 09:41.120]  Obama had lots of executive orders
[09:41.120 --> 09:43.120]  where he would advertise that he legals
[09:43.120 --> 09:45.120]  by the millions could pour in
[09:45.120 --> 09:48.120]  and then the media would simply call them children.
[09:48.120 --> 09:53.120]  Some of them 45-year-old, multiple-time serial killers
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.120]  who'd been deported in some cases more than 40 times.
[09:58.120 --> 10:00.120]  But they just kept saying,
[10:00.120 --> 10:03.120]  oh, but I went to school in Los Angeles
[10:03.120 --> 10:05.120]  or I went to school in Austin, Texas,
[10:05.120 --> 10:07.120]  and look, I'm in the yearbook.
[10:07.120 --> 10:10.120]  That shows how long this has been going on
[10:10.120 --> 10:12.120]  and here's the issue.
[10:12.120 --> 10:15.120]  Mexico or China doesn't let you go there
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.120]  and do anything like the DREAM Act or anything like
[10:18.120 --> 10:20.120]  Anchor Babies or any of it.
[10:20.120 --> 10:22.120]  It's not fair.
[10:22.120 --> 10:24.120]  That's the secret of the DREAM Act
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.120]  and it's being used as a political tool
[10:26.120 --> 10:28.120]  by the Democrats and the Republicans
[10:28.120 --> 10:30.120]  that want cheap labor and voting blocks.
[10:30.120 --> 10:33.120]  And it is penalizing people
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.120]  that come here legally and lawfully,
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.120]  that go to school here in college,
[10:38.120 --> 10:41.120]  that then get their work visas
[10:41.120 --> 10:43.120]  and contribute to the economy.
[10:43.120 --> 10:46.120]  And I'm all for work visas
[10:46.120 --> 10:48.120]  in things that are needed,
[10:48.120 --> 10:51.120]  in areas in the economy where workers are needed
[10:51.120 --> 10:55.120]  and hard-working folks are and smart people are needed.
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.120]  But when it talks about something like engineering
[10:58.120 --> 11:00.120]  or manufacturing,
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.120]  the unions are out today decrying Trump as racist
[11:03.120 --> 11:06.120]  saying DACA will keep wages up.
[11:06.120 --> 11:08.120]  No, it's the opposite.
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.120]  It'll drive wages down to keep that in place.
[11:11.120 --> 11:13.120]  All the economists know.
[11:13.120 --> 11:15.120]  So it's a lot of deception.
[11:15.120 --> 11:17.120]  And since we've had NAFTA and GATT
[11:17.120 --> 11:19.120]  and since we've had more open borders,
[11:19.120 --> 11:21.120]  we've seen our wages go where?
[11:21.120 --> 11:22.120]  Straight down.
[11:22.120 --> 11:25.120]  There's all these graphs that they put out
[11:25.120 --> 11:27.120]  showing by the mid-1970s
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.120]  that American prosperity began to wane.
[11:30.120 --> 11:32.120]  And they say, oh, it's because we're capitalists.
[11:32.120 --> 11:35.120]  No, it's because of offshoring
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.120]  and it's because of bringing in large third-world populations
[11:40.120 --> 11:43.120]  and allowing corporations to use the labor
[11:43.120 --> 11:47.120]  to undercut the middle class of every race, color, and creed.
[11:47.120 --> 11:50.120]  This is a fact that in Latin America,
[11:50.120 --> 11:52.120]  the power structure teach people poor by design.
[11:52.120 --> 11:54.120]  It is a fact in Eastern Europe.
[11:54.120 --> 11:56.120]  That's what's been done for thousands of years.
[11:56.120 --> 11:58.120]  It's a fact that's done in most areas of Asia.
[11:58.120 --> 12:00.120]  The rich families get together
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.120]  and they openly do not want innovation.
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.120]  They want stagnant, class-driven systems.
[12:08.120 --> 12:11.120]  Now, that's started to get eroded in India.
[12:11.120 --> 12:13.120]  It's starting to get eroded in areas of Africa.
[12:13.120 --> 12:15.120]  It's starting to get eroded in Latin America
[12:15.120 --> 12:18.120]  and I'm all for it because if you ever gave free market
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.120]  to many areas of Asia or Latin America,
[12:21.120 --> 12:24.120]  they would take off and within a few decades
[12:24.120 --> 12:28.120]  be gorgeous, amazing, clean, safe, beautiful places.
[12:28.120 --> 12:31.120]  But they've never been allowed to have it
[12:31.120 --> 12:33.120]  and that is the real problem.
[12:33.120 --> 12:36.120]  Turning us, though, into these collapsed nations
[12:36.120 --> 12:38.120]  and these collapsed cultures, he's not going to fix anything.
[12:38.120 --> 12:40.120]  And the globalists in their own white papers
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.120]  admit that they want a large quagmire,
[12:43.120 --> 12:46.120]  a giant underclass, and that they want to get rid
[12:46.120 --> 12:48.120]  of English being the world language
[12:48.120 --> 12:52.120]  to sabotage the world communicating with each other.
[12:52.120 --> 12:55.120]  Tower of Babylonism is what I'd call it.
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.120]  A new language, a new world system called Babylonism.
[12:59.120 --> 13:01.120]  Here it is out of campus reform,
[13:01.120 --> 13:04.120]  major global society for social studies,
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.120]  the main group in the globe, meeting in Boston.
[13:08.120 --> 13:12.120]  As we speak, they just stopped meeting this weekend.
[13:12.120 --> 13:17.120]  Academic conference aims to de-center English in higher ed.
[13:17.120 --> 13:20.120]  You've got all the admissions of bringing down Europe
[13:20.120 --> 13:22.120]  and I played a clip on the Sunday show
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.120]  with the vice president of the EU saying
[13:24.120 --> 13:27.120]  we must end the whiteness of Europe,
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.120]  any country being a central culture is bad.
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.120]  It's bad for globalism that's overriding all the cultures,
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.120]  getting rid of them so AI can come sweeping in.
[13:39.120 --> 13:46.120]  So global, total, standardized control can be in place.
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.120]  I had a all night dream last night
[13:50.120 --> 13:53.120]  that whether it was my mind focusing on all the research
[13:53.120 --> 14:00.120]  and projecting in a visual extravaganza what was coming,
[14:00.120 --> 14:02.120]  whether I've just watched too much science fiction
[14:02.120 --> 14:05.120]  or whether I've read too many statements by top tech gurus
[14:05.120 --> 14:07.120]  or Vladimir Putin,
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.120]  but man I had a dream last night about AI takeover
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.120]  that was unbelievable and so graphic and so step by step
[14:15.120 --> 14:18.120]  like I was being given a briefing in chapters
[14:18.120 --> 14:20.120]  of what was going to come
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.120]  and I woke up about 3 a.m. with a sickening,
[14:23.120 --> 14:25.120]  sad, overwhelmed feeling.
[14:25.120 --> 14:27.120]  Not a feeling of fear,
[14:27.120 --> 14:30.120]  but I understood why the globalists have just acquiesced
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.120]  to this spirit because they're so horrified by it
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.120]  they just hope they don't get destroyed by it
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.120]  because regardless of what my dream was,
[14:38.120 --> 14:44.120]  vision or prime projection analysis or a little bit of both,
[14:44.120 --> 14:47.120]  what humans envision most of the time ends up
[14:47.120 --> 14:50.120]  becoming a reality and what I was envisioning
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.120]  in that in-depth, vivid dream is what most of the elites believe
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.120]  is going to be basically manifest very, very soon.
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.120]  But I know this, if you turn it into a science fiction movie,
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.120]  man, unbelievable.
[15:06.120 --> 15:08.120]  So maybe today, maybe tomorrow,
[15:08.120 --> 15:10.120]  I don't want to just get into something this big
[15:10.120 --> 15:14.120]  and just kind of have it as a side issue,
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.120]  but I may get into that in the days and weeks to come
[15:19.120 --> 15:21.120]  because I did have a dream of jets flying
[15:21.120 --> 15:23.120]  in the World Trade Centers and things like that
[15:23.120 --> 15:25.120]  and I did warn people they were going to blow it up
[15:25.120 --> 15:26.120]  two months before it happened
[15:26.120 --> 15:28.120]  and said they'd blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[15:28.120 --> 15:30.120]  People asked how I knew that.
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.120]  The media's confirmed that I did indeed say that,
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.120]  exactly those words and I had recurring dreams of it happening.
[15:37.120 --> 15:40.120]  So just a little tidbit.
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.120]  There's a lot of things going on in this world
[15:42.120 --> 15:44.120]  that aren't in all the establishments books
[15:44.120 --> 15:46.120]  and they know that.
[15:46.120 --> 15:50.120]  But let me now just get into the main issue, obviously,
[15:50.120 --> 15:52.120]  the thing on our plate right now.
[15:52.120 --> 15:55.120]  Thermonuclear war, the hydrogen bomb,
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.120]  tested over the weekend in North Korea
[15:57.120 --> 15:59.120]  10 times more powerful,
[15:59.120 --> 16:01.120]  showing up way over a sixth magnitude
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.120]  on the Richter scale for a earthquake
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.120]  and confirming that indeed a massive hydrogen bomb was tested.
[16:10.120 --> 16:12.120]  And now they've shown videos and photos
[16:12.120 --> 16:15.120]  of hydrogen bomb casings
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.120]  that they can load on top of ICBMs.
[16:20.120 --> 16:22.120]  And they're threatening to nuke Tokyo.
[16:22.120 --> 16:24.120]  They're threatening to nuke Seoul, South Korea.
[16:24.120 --> 16:26.120]  They're threatening to attack us preemptively.
[16:26.120 --> 16:32.120]  North Korea threats prompt Japan evacuation preparedness.
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.120]  That's out of Japan.
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.120]  Putin says that the nation that leads in AI
[16:38.120 --> 16:39.120]  will be the ruler of the world.
[16:39.120 --> 16:41.120]  I'm going to get more into that today.
[16:41.120 --> 16:45.120]  Putin's also come out and said military hysteria
[16:45.120 --> 16:48.120]  over North Korea may lead to planetary catastrophe,
[16:48.120 --> 16:51.120]  heavy loss of life.
[16:51.120 --> 16:54.120]  Yes, we're coming up against the big crisis right now.
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.120]  And notice the Democrats in Time Magazine and Newsweek
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.120]  all back in January and back in February
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.120]  after Trump had been elected,
[17:03.120 --> 17:06.120]  we need to dig these back up, said,
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.120]  oh, don't worry, Trump's going to be challenged
[17:08.120 --> 17:10.120]  by something internationally
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.120]  when he's first in office that will see
[17:13.120 --> 17:15.120]  what his medal's made of
[17:15.120 --> 17:17.120]  and to see if he can take it
[17:17.120 --> 17:19.120]  and to see if he'll go ahead and join the globalist.
[17:19.120 --> 17:20.120]  And then immediately,
[17:20.120 --> 17:23.120]  we know they have globalist back channels in North Korea.
[17:23.120 --> 17:25.120]  He began to break every agreement
[17:25.120 --> 17:28.120]  and go completely crazy in everyone's face,
[17:28.120 --> 17:30.120]  knowing that he's got big supporters
[17:30.120 --> 17:32.120]  in the Republican and Democratic Party
[17:32.120 --> 17:36.120]  as well as in the Communist Chinese Party of China.
[17:36.120 --> 17:38.120]  And indeed, the Daily Caller has a big article up,
[17:38.120 --> 17:40.120]  anti-Trump resistance groups,
[17:40.120 --> 17:42.120]  some of the largest in the nation
[17:42.120 --> 17:44.120]  spreading North Korean propaganda
[17:44.120 --> 17:47.120]  and even CNN and the New York Times and the Hill
[17:47.120 --> 17:50.120]  are bad-mouthing Trump and our military
[17:54.120 --> 18:00.120]  and acting like that they are the bad guys.
[18:00.120 --> 18:02.120]  This is just lunacy,
[18:02.120 --> 18:04.120]  but this is the whole Machiavellian,
[18:04.120 --> 18:08.120]  everybody stabbing each other in the back paradigm
[18:08.120 --> 18:14.120]  that the globalists have basically created.
[18:14.120 --> 18:16.120]  While they're busy trying to dominate Christians
[18:16.120 --> 18:18.120]  and mount our head politically on the wall
[18:18.120 --> 18:20.120]  and make sure they can sexualize our children,
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.120]  the folks at CNN and salon and all the rest of the enemy media
[18:24.120 --> 18:27.120]  are busy digging their own cultural, historical,
[18:27.120 --> 18:35.120]  economic, civilizational graves.
[18:35.120 --> 18:37.120]  It's the stuff that collapse is made of.
[18:37.120 --> 18:38.120]  Look at RT.
[18:38.120 --> 18:40.120]  Putin, military hysteria over North Korea,
[18:40.120 --> 18:44.120]  may lead to planetary catastrophe, heavy loss of life.
[18:44.120 --> 18:46.120]  But notice, that's RT.
[18:46.120 --> 18:49.120]  Notice how the Hill spun it.
[18:49.120 --> 18:52.120]  Putin urged his Trump to avoid hysteria on North Korea,
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.120]  which is not what he did.
[18:55.120 --> 18:57.120]  They changed the headline.
[18:57.120 --> 18:59.120]  Originally, it was what Putin actually said.
[18:59.120 --> 19:01.120]  You can see it in the URL.
[19:01.120 --> 19:06.120]  Putin warns North Korea could lead
[19:06.120 --> 19:08.120]  to global catastrophe.
[19:08.120 --> 19:10.120]  So the URL stayed the same.
[19:10.120 --> 19:13.120]  They have to kill the story if they did change the URL.
[19:13.120 --> 19:15.120]  But then they changed the headline.
[19:15.120 --> 19:18.120]  Putin urges Trump to avoid hysteria on North Korea.
[19:18.120 --> 19:20.120]  Everything is about undermining our president
[19:20.120 --> 19:26.120]  because the globalists are tasked with decentralizing
[19:26.120 --> 19:28.120]  national power from the people
[19:28.120 --> 19:30.120]  and transferring it to a new centralization,
[19:30.120 --> 19:33.120]  a technocracy controlled by supercomputers
[19:33.120 --> 19:36.120]  that the globalist program for the outcomes they want.
[19:36.120 --> 19:42.120]  And that ties into Obama and this letter that he leaked
[19:42.120 --> 19:44.120]  that he supposedly privately gave to Trump.
[19:44.120 --> 19:46.120]  Isn't that nice of him leaking the letter
[19:46.120 --> 19:48.120]  that was supposedly private, saying,
[19:48.120 --> 19:50.120]  your job is to sustain the international order
[19:50.120 --> 19:52.120]  of world government.
[19:52.120 --> 19:54.120]  Wow, you've come a long way
[19:54.120 --> 19:56.120]  because all this garbage is now out in the open.

[24:29.120 --> 24:31.120]  in my subconscious mind
[24:31.120 --> 24:33.120]  of the some parts of real events
[24:33.120 --> 24:35.120]  that have already taken place
[24:35.120 --> 24:37.120]  or are taking place
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.120]  with the projection into the future
[24:39.120 --> 24:41.120]  along different
[24:41.120 --> 24:43.120]  computational lines.
[24:43.120 --> 24:45.120]  And, of course, the subconscious mind
[24:45.120 --> 24:47.120]  is hundreds, if not thousands of times.
[24:47.120 --> 24:49.120]  And I'm telling you,
[24:49.120 --> 24:51.120]  I'm telling you,
[24:51.120 --> 24:53.120]  my subconscious mind
[24:53.120 --> 24:55.120]  is hundreds, if not thousands of times
[24:55.120 --> 24:57.120]  more powerful in the conscious mind
[24:57.120 --> 24:59.120]  and that's why we get feelings
[24:59.120 --> 25:01.120]  in our gut,
[25:01.120 --> 25:03.120]  the brain through the spinal cord
[25:03.120 --> 25:05.120]  will get our attention
[25:05.120 --> 25:07.120]  where it knows it gets our attention
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.120]  in our stomach
[25:09.120 --> 25:11.120]  in our sixth sense.
[25:11.120 --> 25:13.120]  And I just realized something
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.120]  I've already realized but hit me so strong
[25:15.120 --> 25:17.120]  I've got a lot more peace now
[25:17.120 --> 25:19.120]  than I've had in my frustration
[25:19.120 --> 25:21.120]  gibbering all these factoids out
[25:21.120 --> 25:23.120]  trying to convince people of what's going on
[25:25.120 --> 25:27.120]  that
[25:27.120 --> 25:29.120]  this really is in God's hands
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.120]  and it's a spiritual choice we have to make
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.120]  and that the rulers of this earth
[25:37.120 --> 25:39.120]  are scared of the spirit
[25:39.120 --> 25:41.120]  of this world and they have just completely
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.120]  signed themselves over
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.120]  through fear, most of them not even through
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.120]  lust for power, that's mid-level and low-level folks.
[25:47.120 --> 25:49.120]  The very top of this
[25:49.120 --> 25:51.120]  you don't have incompetent people
[25:51.120 --> 25:53.120]  like Nancy Pelosi
[25:53.120 --> 25:55.120]  Chuck Schumer
[25:55.120 --> 25:57.120]  and folks like that little grasping nobodies
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.120]  you've got
[25:59.120 --> 26:01.120]  really, really smart
[26:01.120 --> 26:03.120]  people that are
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.120]  scared
[26:07.120 --> 26:09.120]  and also fascinated with
[26:09.120 --> 26:11.120]  the universe and who
[26:11.120 --> 26:13.120]  think they've made their bets
[26:13.120 --> 26:15.120]  with
[26:15.120 --> 26:17.120]  the winning party
[26:19.120 --> 26:21.120]  and they're all fighting
[26:21.120 --> 26:23.120]  for control of the planet
[26:23.120 --> 26:25.120]  to then dutifully execute
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.120]  this blueprint
[26:31.120 --> 26:33.120]  that no matter if you're in France
[26:33.120 --> 26:35.120]  or Russia or China or
[26:35.120 --> 26:37.120]  the United States or
[26:37.120 --> 26:39.120]  Egypt
[26:39.120 --> 26:41.120]  gets expressed
[26:45.120 --> 26:47.120]  beyond
[26:51.120 --> 26:53.120]  any
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.120]  explainable
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.120]  way
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.120]  in the modern limited spectrum
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.120]  of kosher thought
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.120]  and more and more the establishment
[27:07.120 --> 27:09.120]  just completely dialed out
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.120]  and just thinks we're a complete joke
[27:11.120 --> 27:13.120]  and kind of has MSNBC
[27:13.120 --> 27:15.120]  and CNN and the academia and the media
[27:15.120 --> 27:17.120]  as a rearguard action
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.120]  to just entertain people
[27:21.120 --> 27:23.120]  and confuse people and make people
[27:23.120 --> 27:25.120]  as cowardly and dysfunctional
[27:25.120 --> 27:27.120]  as possible so they never
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.120]  know what even hits them.
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.120]  See a spider
[27:31.120 --> 27:33.120]  will bite
[27:35.120 --> 27:37.120]  you
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.120]  if you're in a bug it's going to eat
[27:39.120 --> 27:41.120]  and just put a little bit of venom into you
[27:41.120 --> 27:43.120]  to immobilize you
[27:43.120 --> 27:45.120]  and then it'll tie you up
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.120]  and pump some more venom in just to liquefy
[27:51.120 --> 27:53.120]  enough of you that you're barely still alive
[27:53.120 --> 27:55.120]  and your heart's still barely beating
[27:55.120 --> 27:57.120]  and the spider comes over and puts its front
[27:57.120 --> 27:59.120]  leg up on you and checks the heart rate
[27:59.120 --> 28:01.120]  okay it's almost
[28:01.120 --> 28:03.120]  and then kind of waits and just knows
[28:03.120 --> 28:05.120]  and comes over and touches it again and says
[28:05.120 --> 28:07.120]  okay you're pretty much liquefied
[28:07.120 --> 28:09.120]  bites you again to kill you
[28:09.120 --> 28:11.120]  to fully liquefy everything
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.120]  and then sucks the juices out
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.120]  and that's what all this attack on the family
[28:15.120 --> 28:17.120]  and attack on farming and attack on
[28:17.120 --> 28:19.120]  men being men and women being women
[28:19.120 --> 28:21.120]  all of this is simply us tied up
[28:21.120 --> 28:23.120]  in a spider's web
[28:23.120 --> 28:25.120]  with this entity this system
[28:25.120 --> 28:27.120]  getting us ready for the big stroke
[28:27.120 --> 28:29.120]  it's kind of like a matador
[28:29.120 --> 28:31.120]  gets the bull angry
[28:31.120 --> 28:33.120]  and throws the darts into his back
[28:33.120 --> 28:35.120]  and gets him really into a big lather
[28:35.120 --> 28:37.120]  and prepares him for the crowd
[28:37.120 --> 28:39.120]  and then tells the crowd now I'll deal the death blow
[28:39.120 --> 28:41.120]  and has the red cape the distraction
[28:41.120 --> 28:43.120]  and then runs the sword straight into the heart
[28:43.120 --> 28:45.120]  using the strength
[28:45.120 --> 28:47.120]  of the bull itself
[28:47.120 --> 28:49.120]  to force that sword
[28:49.120 --> 28:51.120]  through a foot or more of
[28:51.120 --> 28:53.120]  meat
[28:53.120 --> 28:55.120]  and bone
[28:55.120 --> 28:57.120]  not an easy feat
[28:59.120 --> 29:01.120]  and if you can do it on the first stab
[29:01.120 --> 29:03.120]  without having to be handed another sword
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.120]  why you're one of the greats aren't you
[29:07.120 --> 29:09.120]  and that's all they're doing is just
[29:11.120 --> 29:13.120]  getting us all lathered up
[29:13.120 --> 29:15.120]  and a bunch of darts in our back
[29:15.120 --> 29:17.120]  and we're kicking and snorting and snarling and running
[29:17.120 --> 29:19.120]  and they're just sitting back
[29:19.120 --> 29:21.120]  just sitting back of that sword
[29:21.120 --> 29:23.120]  gonna run that sucker right down
[29:23.120 --> 29:25.120]  through our ribs
[29:25.120 --> 29:27.120]  right into our heart
[29:27.120 --> 29:29.120]  not
[29:29.120 --> 29:31.120]  if people are conscious of the operation
[29:31.120 --> 29:33.120]  and I am conscious of it
[29:33.120 --> 29:35.120]  that's why the globalists fear us
[29:35.120 --> 29:37.120]  that's why they've been trying to inoculate you psychologically
[29:37.120 --> 29:39.120]  not to listen because they know
[29:39.120 --> 29:41.120]  that I'm gonna have these breakthroughs to the next level
[29:41.120 --> 29:43.120]  and I've had the breakthroughs
[29:43.120 --> 29:45.120]  I've been having them but now I've got
[29:45.120 --> 29:47.120]  the full picture
[29:47.120 --> 29:49.120]  I've got the full battle plan
[29:49.120 --> 29:51.120]  we're on the march the empire's on the run
[29:51.120 --> 29:53.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[30:21.120 --> 30:23.120]  it may be a bitter pill to swallow
[30:23.120 --> 30:25.120]  but the right to keep in bare arms
[30:25.120 --> 30:27.120]  is not an outdated dusty idea
[30:27.120 --> 30:29.120]  some old dead white guys
[30:29.120 --> 30:31.120]  dreamed up in fear of the redcoats
[30:31.120 --> 30:33.120]  no it is just as essential to liberty today
[30:33.120 --> 30:35.120]  as it was in 1776
[30:37.120 --> 30:39.120]  the original amendments we refer to as the
[30:39.120 --> 30:41.120]  Bill of Rights contained 10 of what the constitutional
[30:41.120 --> 30:43.120]  framers termed unalienable rights
[30:43.120 --> 30:45.120]  the Bill of Rights came to us
[30:45.120 --> 30:47.120]  with blinders on
[30:47.120 --> 30:49.120]  it doesn't recognize color or class
[30:49.120 --> 30:51.120]  or wealth it protects not just the rights
[30:51.120 --> 30:53.120]  of actors or editors
[30:53.120 --> 30:55.120]  or reporters but extends even to those
[30:55.120 --> 30:57.120]  we love to hate this is a small
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.120]  excerpt from Tralton Heston

[31:07.120 --> 31:09.120]  coffee on the planet for more than a decade

[31:11.120 --> 31:13.120]  from the high mountains of southern Mexico
[31:13.120 --> 31:15.120]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique
[31:15.120 --> 31:17.120]  shade-grown Arabica beans
[31:17.120 --> 31:19.120]  and now manage to secure the sought-after

[31:35.120 --> 31:37.120]  hands down this is my favorite coffee
[31:37.120 --> 31:39.120]  and it's taken us years to secure

[33:27.120 --> 33:45.120]  what am i getting at when i say i've got the big picture
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.120]  well i guarantee you
[33:47.120 --> 33:51.120]  that when i go over this information
[33:51.120 --> 33:53.120]  today tomorrow whenever it is
[33:53.120 --> 33:56.120]  that you're going to say
[33:56.120 --> 33:58.120]  tell us something we didn't know
[33:58.120 --> 34:00.120]  we know this is the absolute truth
[34:00.120 --> 34:02.120]  this is what we all know in our hearts
[34:02.120 --> 34:04.120]  what we all know in our guts
[34:04.120 --> 34:08.120]  and what is already manifesting in front of us
[34:08.120 --> 34:10.120]  so when i say that i am at peace
[34:10.120 --> 34:14.120]  i understand
[34:14.120 --> 34:16.120]  that there's no going around this
[34:16.120 --> 34:18.120]  there's no stopping this
[34:18.120 --> 34:20.120]  this is going to be the final test of humanity
[34:20.120 --> 34:24.120]  the epiphany is
[34:24.120 --> 34:26.120]  the race garbage and the infighting
[34:26.120 --> 34:28.120]  and the selfishness
[34:28.120 --> 34:30.120]  and caring about hollywood
[34:30.120 --> 34:32.120]  and caring about big nice things
[34:32.120 --> 34:38.120]  and caring about just the accumulation of material
[34:38.120 --> 34:40.120]  i've never been obsessed with it
[34:40.120 --> 34:42.120]  it's never been my god
[34:42.120 --> 34:46.120]  it's never been at the top of my hierarchy of needs
[34:46.120 --> 34:52.120]  but now i absolutely loathe it
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.120]  because it's used
[34:56.120 --> 34:58.120]  to control people
[34:58.120 --> 35:00.120]  again i'm stating completely
[35:00.120 --> 35:02.120]  just known facts here
[35:02.120 --> 35:04.120]  and that's why the globalists try to keep people poor
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.120]  so that they always are obsessed
[35:06.120 --> 35:08.120]  only on the lower level material
[35:08.120 --> 35:10.120]  and never go up the true
[35:10.120 --> 35:12.120]  steps of development
[35:12.120 --> 35:14.120]  to see the heights
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.120]  of the universe that lay out before us
[35:18.120 --> 35:20.120]  they never come out
[35:20.120 --> 35:22.120]  of play does cave
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.120]  and the globalist great crime is
[35:24.120 --> 35:26.120]  they are attempting to have total world dominion
[35:26.120 --> 35:28.120]  play god
[35:28.120 --> 35:30.120]  have absolute ai control
[35:30.120 --> 35:32.120]  over all human animal plant
[35:32.120 --> 35:34.120]  bacterial activity
[35:34.120 --> 35:36.120]  rewrite the planet
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.120]  in a type of genesis weapon
[35:40.120 --> 35:42.120]  event
[35:42.120 --> 35:44.120]  and then you're like
[35:44.120 --> 35:46.120]  yeah alex you're not
[35:46.120 --> 35:48.120]  enlightening anybody
[35:48.120 --> 35:50.120]  about anything we didn't already know
[35:50.120 --> 35:52.120]  it's in all the popular culture
[35:52.120 --> 35:54.120]  they're telling us what they're planning to do
[35:54.120 --> 35:56.120]  but let me tell you
[35:56.120 --> 35:58.120]  it doesn't look in the different scenarios
[35:58.120 --> 36:00.120]  that have been written down scientifically
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.120]  but top
[36:02.120 --> 36:04.120]  theoreticians and futurists
[36:04.120 --> 36:06.120]  it doesn't look like some painless
[36:06.120 --> 36:08.120]  genesis event
[36:10.120 --> 36:12.120]  like they'd have in stark trek rathicon
[36:12.120 --> 36:14.120]  where you shoot a dead planet
[36:14.120 --> 36:16.120]  with a system and suddenly it creates life
[36:16.120 --> 36:18.120]  this is something that chews up life
[36:18.120 --> 36:20.120]  that was already there
[36:20.120 --> 36:22.120]  and then spits it out on the other side
[36:22.120 --> 36:24.120]  something completely different
[36:24.120 --> 36:26.120]  and that uses
[36:26.120 --> 36:28.120]  all the ingenuity and science and technology
[36:28.120 --> 36:30.120]  and raw
[36:30.120 --> 36:32.120]  minerals
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.120]  and raw rare earth systems that we've brought to the surface
[36:34.120 --> 36:36.120]  to just plug in
[36:36.120 --> 36:38.120]  a nanotech
[36:38.120 --> 36:40.120]  think 3D printer
[36:40.120 --> 36:42.120]  on a colossal scale
[36:42.120 --> 36:44.120]  that instantaneously
[36:44.120 --> 36:46.120]  sucks in matter
[36:46.120 --> 36:48.120]  reorganizes it
[36:48.120 --> 36:50.120]  in the way it's been programmed
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.120]  and builds an entire new system
[36:54.120 --> 36:56.120]  as it overwrites
[36:56.120 --> 36:58.120]  the
[36:58.120 --> 37:00.120]  original
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.120]  in an act of total
[37:02.120 --> 37:04.120]  willful
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.120]  complete domination over the planet
[37:06.120 --> 37:08.120]  over God's creation and over our free will
[37:10.120 --> 37:12.120]  a giant satanic ritual
[37:12.120 --> 37:14.120]  and
[37:14.120 --> 37:16.120]  that's what this planet now is
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.120]  is a giant satanic experiment
[37:18.120 --> 37:20.120]  we are deep
[37:20.120 --> 37:22.120]  deep in the hold of it now
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.120]  you can see the screen sickness
[37:24.120 --> 37:26.120]  as I call it people that watch television
[37:26.120 --> 37:28.120]  and play on their iPhones and don't talk to each other anymore
[37:28.120 --> 37:30.120]  you can see the cultural breakdowns
[37:30.120 --> 37:32.120]  the mental illness, the narcissism
[37:32.120 --> 37:34.120]  all of it just
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.120]  rampantly exploding
[37:36.120 --> 37:38.120]  and they all have that weird little piggy
[37:38.120 --> 37:40.120]  smile on their face
[37:40.120 --> 37:42.120]  and the eyes that are lit up like a jack-o-lantern
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.120]  we've all got friends
[37:44.120 --> 37:46.120]  and family and neighbors that have succumbed to it
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.120]  you look at Kim Jong-un
[37:48.120 --> 37:50.120]  when he's walking around trying to look self-confident
[37:50.120 --> 37:52.120]  satisfied
[37:52.120 --> 37:54.120]  that horrific demon creature
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.120]  with that jack-o-lantern smile
[37:56.120 --> 37:58.120]  and all the sycophants
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.120]  scared to death worshiping him
[38:00.120 --> 38:02.120]  and every sycophant beneath them worshiping them
[38:02.120 --> 38:04.120]  and those beneath them worshiping those above them
[38:04.120 --> 38:10.120]  and a giant hierarchical delusional
[38:14.120 --> 38:16.120]  virtual reality exercise
[38:16.120 --> 38:18.120]  that's what delusion is
[38:18.120 --> 38:20.120]  is just activating some
[38:20.120 --> 38:22.120]  program in your brain that you're God
[38:22.120 --> 38:24.120]  and that you're invincible
[38:24.120 --> 38:26.120]  and that you're all powerful
[38:26.120 --> 38:28.120]  because you buy into the world
[38:28.120 --> 38:30.120]  you buy into its fraud
[38:30.120 --> 38:32.120]  it's a spirit you don't need to go plug your brain in
[38:32.120 --> 38:34.120]  like PKD thought they would
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.120]  with a wire
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.120]  to be in ecstasy all the time
[38:38.120 --> 38:40.120]  so you don't want to leave the matrix
[38:40.120 --> 38:42.120]  the truth is as this world forces people
[38:42.120 --> 38:44.120]  into mental illness
[38:44.120 --> 38:46.120]  it's a spiritual matrix
[38:46.120 --> 38:48.120]  where they're already gone
[38:48.120 --> 38:50.120]  living in the third dimension
[38:50.120 --> 38:52.120]  but no longer conscious
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.120]  turning their psyches over to something
[38:54.120 --> 38:56.120]  completely different
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.120]  it's amazing
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.120]  so let me go ahead
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.120]  and just go over some headlines
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.120]  that's probably the best thing to do
[39:12.120 --> 39:14.120]  here is president
[39:14.120 --> 39:16.120]  Vladimir Putin
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.120]  coming out and saying
[39:22.120 --> 39:24.120]  whoever develops true
[39:24.120 --> 39:26.120]  AI first
[39:26.120 --> 39:28.120]  will be the quote
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.120]  ruler of the world
[39:30.120 --> 39:32.120]  whoever creates
[39:32.120 --> 39:34.120]  real AI
[39:36.120 --> 39:38.120]  programmed and controlled
[39:40.120 --> 39:42.120]  by the people
[39:42.120 --> 39:44.120]  and the spirit of this world
[39:44.120 --> 39:46.120]  will be creating
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.120]  the technological black
[39:50.120 --> 39:52.120]  hole
[39:52.120 --> 39:54.120]  that will absorb
[39:54.120 --> 39:56.120]  this planet
[39:56.120 --> 39:58.120]  in very rapid succession
[39:58.120 --> 40:00.120]  might as well just create a
[40:00.120 --> 40:02.120]  strange lit or a black hole artificially
[40:02.120 --> 40:04.120]  at CERN and be done with it
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.120]  oh sorry
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.120]  they're trying to do that there
[40:08.120 --> 40:10.120]  then they put Shiva
[40:10.120 --> 40:12.120]  the god of destruction
[40:12.120 --> 40:14.120]  and rebirth
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.120]  there to worship her
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.120]  while they admit
[40:18.120 --> 40:20.120]  they are engaging
[40:20.120 --> 40:22.120]  in particle acceleration experiments
[40:22.120 --> 40:24.120]  designed to create black holes
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.120]  strange lits
[40:26.120 --> 40:28.120]  and to break into other dimensions
[40:28.120 --> 40:30.120]  which many physicists believe
[40:30.120 --> 40:32.120]  with the equations could cause
[40:32.120 --> 40:34.120]  catastrophic chain reaction
[40:34.120 --> 40:36.120]  explosions if you think
[40:36.120 --> 40:38.120]  mining some mountains
[40:38.120 --> 40:40.120]  mining some limestone
[40:40.120 --> 40:42.120]  and purifying it
[40:42.120 --> 40:44.120]  and then smashing it together
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.120]  with 1900 equations
[40:46.120 --> 40:48.120]  can destroy the planet
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.120]  what do you think they're doing
[40:50.120 --> 40:52.120]  right now
[40:52.120 --> 40:54.120]  and they're telling you what they're doing
[40:56.120 --> 40:58.120]  and if the Hollywood folks
[40:58.120 --> 41:00.120]  think running to New Zealand
[41:00.120 --> 41:02.120]  is going to protect them
[41:02.120 --> 41:04.120]  they've got another thing coming
[41:08.120 --> 41:10.120]  it's the search for godhood
[41:10.120 --> 41:12.120]  and they are just
[41:12.120 --> 41:14.120]  running headlong
[41:14.120 --> 41:16.120]  like mad scientist of old
[41:24.120 --> 41:26.120]  you take North Korea
[41:28.120 --> 41:30.120]  they didn't have missiles that would go 50 miles
[41:30.120 --> 41:32.120]  in 1990
[41:32.120 --> 41:34.120]  by 1996
[41:34.120 --> 41:36.120]  they had missiles that could go 2,000 kilometers
[41:36.120 --> 41:38.120]  and they had
[41:38.120 --> 41:40.120]  a bomb
[41:40.120 --> 41:42.120]  material from the reactors
[41:42.120 --> 41:44.120]  by the Clintons
[41:44.120 --> 41:46.120]  and Jimmy Carter
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.120]  and all the usual suspects
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.120]  show China
[41:50.120 --> 41:52.120]  how much we love them
[41:52.120 --> 41:54.120]  show them how much we love them
[41:54.120 --> 41:56.120]  show them how much we love them
[41:56.120 --> 41:58.120]  they just wanted factories and jobs
[41:58.120 --> 42:00.120]  and industry through the communist party
[42:00.120 --> 42:02.120]  that globalists
[42:02.120 --> 42:04.120]  could own part of
[42:04.120 --> 42:06.120]  and live in China part of the year
[42:06.120 --> 42:08.120]  like absolute kings
[42:08.120 --> 42:10.120]  where the George Soros
[42:10.120 --> 42:12.120]  and China
[42:12.120 --> 42:14.120]  they tell a party official
[42:14.120 --> 42:16.120]  and just like that they're arrested and killed
[42:16.120 --> 42:18.120]  those
[42:18.120 --> 42:20.120]  are the type of people
[42:20.120 --> 42:22.120]  that are shaping our world
[42:22.120 --> 42:24.120]  completely cold-blooded
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.120]  while they tell you about Black Lives Matter
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.120]  and while they tell you about DACA
[42:28.120 --> 42:30.120]  and the Dreamers and how much Apple
[42:30.120 --> 42:32.120]  and Google and Facebook love you
[42:32.120 --> 42:34.120]  when all of those companies
[42:34.120 --> 42:36.120]  are developing goods
[42:36.120 --> 42:38.120]  in the most horrific slave markets
[42:38.120 --> 42:40.120]  and slave pits
[42:40.120 --> 42:42.120]  in China
[42:42.120 --> 42:44.120]  oh, but they give money to
[42:44.120 --> 42:46.120]  Black Lives Matter
[42:46.120 --> 42:48.120]  to make that the only
[42:48.120 --> 42:50.120]  issue on the planet
[42:50.120 --> 42:52.120]  because it's a sick joke
[42:52.120 --> 42:54.120]  and creates division
[42:54.120 --> 42:56.120]  they only under my country
[42:56.120 --> 42:58.120]  that had a foundation of basic freedom
[42:58.120 --> 43:00.120]  where the renaissance of ideas
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.120]  and technology could be for you and your family
[43:02.120 --> 43:04.120]  the globalist only attack that
[43:04.120 --> 43:06.120]  and they only attack systems
[43:06.120 --> 43:08.120]  that would allow us to communicate
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.120]  with each other admitting
[43:10.120 --> 43:12.120]  they want to create a tower of Babel
[43:12.120 --> 43:14.120]  where humans can't communicate and work together
[43:14.120 --> 43:16.120]  so that we will fall to the new machine
[43:16.120 --> 43:18.120]  language
[43:18.120 --> 43:20.120]  they envisioned this
[43:20.120 --> 43:22.120]  160 years ago in England
[43:24.120 --> 43:26.120]  when they launched the program of modern
[43:26.120 --> 43:28.120]  eugenics and biometrics
[43:28.120 --> 43:30.120]  now you don't think they just thought this up
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.120]  theoretically do you?
[43:32.120 --> 43:34.120]  no
[43:34.120 --> 43:36.120]  if you're a Dalton
[43:36.120 --> 43:38.120]  and Wedgewood
[43:38.120 --> 43:40.120]  and Huxley and Darwin and others
[43:40.120 --> 43:42.120]  go read where they say
[43:42.120 --> 43:44.120]  they got all this information
[43:44.120 --> 43:46.120]  everything you're seeing
[43:46.120 --> 43:48.120]  the computers, the double helix
[43:48.120 --> 43:50.120]  the biometrics
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.120]  the barcodes and the Nazi death camps
[43:52.120 --> 43:54.120]  all of it, all of it
[43:54.120 --> 43:56.120]  all of it in visions
[43:58.120 --> 44:00.120]  and they inbred
[44:00.120 --> 44:02.120]  five British families
[44:02.120 --> 44:04.120]  to produce a super psychic
[44:04.120 --> 44:06.120]  that could receive
[44:06.120 --> 44:08.120]  from beyond the void
[44:08.120 --> 44:10.120]  the information
[44:10.120 --> 44:12.120]  I don't care if they make fun of us about this
[44:12.120 --> 44:14.120]  because this isn't what I believe
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.120]  this is what they believe
[44:18.120 --> 44:20.120]  and so they theoretically envisioned
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.120]  in the 1850s and 60s
[44:22.120 --> 44:24.120]  10 my film end game
[44:24.120 --> 44:26.120]  mainstream news, eugenics quarterly all of it
[44:26.120 --> 44:28.120]  the entire plan
[44:28.120 --> 44:30.120]  that's why in the
[44:34.120 --> 44:36.120]  late 1890s
[44:36.120 --> 44:38.120]  they had
[44:38.120 --> 44:40.120]  science fiction writers
[44:40.120 --> 44:42.120]  writing about atomic and hydrogen bombs
[44:42.120 --> 44:44.120]  even though the equations hadn't officially been
[44:44.120 --> 44:46.120]  put out until a few years later
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.120]  why is that?
[44:48.120 --> 44:50.120]  why do they do that?
[44:52.120 --> 44:54.120]  this is hardcore folks
[44:54.120 --> 44:56.120]  this is what the false Illuminati
[44:56.120 --> 44:58.120]  really are
[44:58.120 --> 45:00.120]  and I've got so much news to cover
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.120]  but Putin says
[45:02.120 --> 45:04.120]  the nation that leads
[45:04.120 --> 45:06.120]  in AI will be the ruler
[45:06.120 --> 45:08.120]  of the world, no
[45:08.120 --> 45:10.120]  the nation
[45:10.120 --> 45:12.120]  that leads in AI will appear to take over the world
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.120]  but it will really be AI
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.120]  and the driverless cars
[45:16.120 --> 45:18.120]  and the systems and the smart dust
[45:18.120 --> 45:20.120]  and the tracking and the internet of things
[45:20.120 --> 45:22.120]  giving the AI its complete
[45:22.120 --> 45:24.120]  interface with humans
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.120]  and animals and plants
[45:26.120 --> 45:28.120]  to have close to
[45:28.120 --> 45:30.120]  synthetic
[45:30.120 --> 45:32.120]  limited
[45:32.120 --> 45:34.120]  omnipresent vision
[45:34.120 --> 45:36.120]  which they admit is to predict the future
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.120]  then control stimuli
[45:38.120 --> 45:40.120]  to control the future
[45:40.120 --> 45:42.120]  and then the individuals will worship
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.120]  the beast
[45:44.120 --> 45:46.120]  whose image will be everywhere
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.120]  and whose likeness will be everywhere
[45:48.120 --> 45:50.120]  and who will be walking amongst a scene everywhere
[45:50.120 --> 45:52.120]  a computer consciousness
[45:52.120 --> 45:54.120]  walking around in robots
[45:54.120 --> 45:56.120]  in your appliances
[45:56.120 --> 45:58.120]  in your little smart phone, in your TV shows
[45:58.120 --> 46:00.120]  always there
[46:00.120 --> 46:02.120]  medical breakthroughs
[46:02.120 --> 46:04.120]  scientific breakthroughs
[46:04.120 --> 46:06.120]  homes built in minutes
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.120]  by nanotech
[46:08.120 --> 46:10.120]  anything you could ever imagine
[46:10.120 --> 46:12.120]  everyone being given their world ID card
[46:12.120 --> 46:14.120]  and free stuff
[46:14.120 --> 46:16.120]  on their card
[46:16.120 --> 46:18.120]  free money, no more having to work
[46:18.120 --> 46:20.120]  enjoying yourself
[46:20.120 --> 46:22.120]  do whatever you want
[46:22.120 --> 46:24.120]  all the time getting sucked
[46:24.120 --> 46:26.120]  deeper and deeper out of the land
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.120]  out of the real world
[46:28.120 --> 46:30.120]  into the artificial construct
[46:30.120 --> 46:32.120]  until when they drop the hammer
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.120]  and this thing goes to its next phase
[46:34.120 --> 46:36.120]  once its webs and tentacles
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.120]  are grown into anything
[46:38.120 --> 46:40.120]  and everything
[46:40.120 --> 46:42.120]  all the crops are GMO
[46:42.120 --> 46:44.120]  all the vaccines are nanotech
[46:44.120 --> 46:46.120]  once all of that is in place
[46:46.120 --> 46:48.120]  they will then drop the hammer
[46:48.120 --> 46:50.120]  into the next level
[46:50.120 --> 46:52.120]  of what they believe is directed evolution
[46:54.120 --> 46:56.120]  and they've already made the decision that we're obsolete
[46:56.120 --> 46:58.120]  that they're going to merge the machines
[46:58.120 --> 47:00.120]  and become God
[47:00.120 --> 47:02.120]  and helps
[47:02.120 --> 47:04.120]  rid the earth of the horrible
[47:04.120 --> 47:06.120]  scourge that is homo sapien sapien
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.120]  when really it's just an excuse, a total genocide
[47:12.120 --> 47:14.120]  mass exterminism
[47:14.120 --> 47:16.120]  absolute orgy of satanic power
[47:18.120 --> 47:20.120]  but just as the bible
[47:20.120 --> 47:22.120]  warned us of all this
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.120]  you have to ask yourself
[47:24.120 --> 47:26.120]  are they using it as a blueprint of control
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.120]  a pre-planned
[47:28.120 --> 47:30.120]  program
[47:30.120 --> 47:32.120]  predictive programming
[47:32.120 --> 47:34.120]  a missionary protectorate
[47:34.120 --> 47:36.120]  no
[47:36.120 --> 47:38.120]  people saying that are deluding themselves
[47:38.120 --> 47:40.120]  this is the universe
[47:40.120 --> 47:42.120]  God's way of giving us
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.120]  a free will
[47:44.120 --> 47:46.120]  chance to recognize
[47:46.120 --> 47:48.120]  the mark of the beast, the world government
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.120]  already hundreds of conservative libertarian christian groups
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.120]  in europe, the united states and canada
[47:52.120 --> 47:54.120]  and australia cannot buy or sell
[47:54.120 --> 47:56.120]  cannot have paypal accounts
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.120]  cannot have amazon accounts
[47:58.120 --> 48:00.120]  and soon those will be the only accounts there are
[48:02.120 --> 48:04.120]  the environmental police
[48:04.120 --> 48:06.120]  are going into all the rural areas
[48:06.120 --> 48:08.120]  the amish communities, all the groups
[48:08.120 --> 48:10.120]  that have broken off from this system
[48:10.120 --> 48:12.120]  attacking them and encircling them
[48:12.120 --> 48:14.120]  and outlawing them
[48:18.120 --> 48:20.120]  it is a total takeover
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.120]  and many people serving it
[48:22.120 --> 48:24.120]  know the plan and they want to be servants
[48:24.120 --> 48:26.120]  of it and believe that they are
[48:26.120 --> 48:28.120]  going to be in the upper echelons
[48:28.120 --> 48:30.120]  of this program
[48:30.120 --> 48:32.120]  and somehow they'll break away from us
[48:32.120 --> 48:34.120]  after disgracing
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.120]  humanity, disgracing our species
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.120]  shelling out to pure evil
[48:38.120 --> 48:40.120]  that you are going to cross
[48:42.120 --> 48:44.120]  the river
[48:44.120 --> 48:46.120]  jordan
[48:46.120 --> 48:48.120]  enter the promised land
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.120]  metaphysically if you were a good person
[48:56.120 --> 48:58.120]  like moses you wouldn't pass
[48:58.120 --> 49:00.120]  across because you were part of the old
[49:00.120 --> 49:02.120]  and still so evil because you knew everything
[49:02.120 --> 49:04.120]  the world had to be innocent again
[49:04.120 --> 49:06.120]  the children had to be crossed
[49:06.120 --> 49:08.120]  whole generations
[49:08.120 --> 49:10.120]  that didn't remember all the corruption
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.120]  the manipulation, the evil, the worshiping
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.120]  the golden calf
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.120]  you will be the last people
[49:18.120 --> 49:20.120]  that would ever, even if satan
[49:20.120 --> 49:22.120]  wasn't running this program
[49:22.120 --> 49:24.120]  make it across
[49:24.120 --> 49:26.120]  but you enjoy the power
[49:26.120 --> 49:28.120]  you enjoy playing like you are in the priest class
[49:28.120 --> 49:30.120]  and you entered into the temple
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.120]  and now you can see all the secrets
[49:32.120 --> 49:34.120]  even as you work around the clock
[49:34.120 --> 49:36.120]  from the public and to make sure
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.120]  they don't have any real free will
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.120]  to decide what they want to do
[49:40.120 --> 49:42.120]  you want to slip them into a hot bath
[49:42.120 --> 49:44.120]  and slip their wrist so they don't even
[49:44.120 --> 49:46.120]  feel that you've slipped their wrist
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.120]  well you put a nice little tv show
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  on forum, a little baby mobile
[49:50.120 --> 49:52.120]  forum so they can watch the pretty colors
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.120]  projected while their blood drains
[49:54.120 --> 50:06.120]  down into the sewer
[50:06.120 --> 50:08.120]  let's get this break
[50:08.120 --> 50:10.120]  here is, Vladimir Putin
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.120]  says the nation that leads
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.120]  in AI will be
[50:14.120 --> 50:16.120]  the ruler of the world, no?
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.120]  the nation
[50:18.120 --> 50:20.120]  that leads in AI
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.120]  will
[50:22.120 --> 50:24.120]  open the gates of hell
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.120]  as you've already seen
[50:26.120 --> 50:28.120]  because the technology
[50:28.120 --> 50:30.120]  that's been developed
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.120]  is twisted and is fallen
[50:32.120 --> 50:34.120]  and by every measurement
[50:34.120 --> 50:36.120]  by every gauge, by every metric
[50:36.120 --> 50:38.120]  by every system
[50:38.120 --> 50:40.120]  it is destroying our health
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  our minds, our creativity
[50:42.120 --> 50:44.120]  our beauty, our strength
[50:44.120 --> 50:46.120]  our honor, our will
[50:48.120 --> 50:50.120]  and so here is humanity
[50:50.120 --> 50:52.120]  at the threshold
[50:54.120 --> 50:56.120]  at the great crossroads
[50:56.120 --> 50:58.120]  of our ancient
[50:58.120 --> 51:00.120]  and great past
[51:00.120 --> 51:02.120]  on this planet
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.120]  set out again
[51:04.120 --> 51:06.120]  to see
[51:06.120 --> 51:08.120]  if we can pass
[51:08.120 --> 51:10.120]  to see if we can pass
[51:10.120 --> 51:12.120]  the test when we've been warned
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.120]  and given the blueprints
[51:16.120 --> 51:18.120]  something tells me
[51:18.120 --> 51:20.120]  in other tests
[51:20.120 --> 51:22.120]  God didn't give people a warning or a blueprint
[51:24.120 --> 51:26.120]  something tells me
[51:26.120 --> 51:28.120]  deep down, this has been done a couple times before
[51:30.120 --> 51:32.120]  and
[51:32.120 --> 51:34.120]  we're way out here in the middle of nowhere
[51:34.120 --> 51:36.120]  because we're dangerous
[51:36.120 --> 51:38.120]  see, who knows if we pass this test
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.120]  if there'll be another test
[51:40.120 --> 51:42.120]  and still another
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.120]  we're creatures
[51:44.120 --> 51:46.120]  that can envision
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.120]  and then build
[51:48.120 --> 51:50.120]  all the splendor, all the magic
[51:50.120 --> 51:52.120]  all the science, all the incredible inventions
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.120]  you've seen
[51:58.120 --> 52:00.120]  so why does the television tell you
[52:00.120 --> 52:02.120]  you're crap all day
[52:02.120 --> 52:04.120]  why is it shovel ugliness at you
[52:04.120 --> 52:06.120]  well, it's declassified
[52:06.120 --> 52:08.120]  the CIA run by the Ford Foundation
[52:08.120 --> 52:10.120]  starting in the 1950s
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.120]  wants to shovel ugliness at you
[52:12.120 --> 52:14.120]  ugly architecture, ugly culture
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.120]  wants to break up everything
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.120]  so you are scared and alone
[52:18.120 --> 52:20.120]  and again
[52:20.120 --> 52:22.120]  it's in all the WikiLeaks documents
[52:28.120 --> 52:30.120]  it's in the Facebook
[52:30.120 --> 52:32.120]  how they want to keep you alone and stupid
[52:36.120 --> 52:38.120]  it's in all their own admissions
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.120]  that they've got you targeted and surrounded
[52:40.120 --> 52:42.120]  with fake bots so you think of your friends
[52:42.120 --> 52:44.120]  and a few of your real friends
[52:44.120 --> 52:46.120]  that troll through
[52:46.120 --> 52:48.120]  and as prisoners you have no idea
[52:48.120 --> 52:50.120]  you're going over the edge of a cliff together
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.120]  now, I should have plugged at the beginning
[52:52.120 --> 52:54.120]  I'm not good at that
[52:54.120 --> 52:56.120]  Ted Nugent's coming on
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.120]  I noticed he was in a blabbermouth article
[52:58.120 --> 53:00.120]  in fact, I meant to give it to you guys
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.120]  can you grab it all blabbermouth
[53:02.120 --> 53:04.120]  for some audio of it
[53:04.120 --> 53:06.120]  or he said he talked to some of his tech folks
[53:06.120 --> 53:08.120]  in the government and they said, hey, Nugent
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.120]  did you know you're really 15 times
[53:10.120 --> 53:12.120]  bigger than what they say on Facebook
[53:12.120 --> 53:14.120]  well, I didn't need to hear that from his tech people
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.120]  I've seen him when he's got 25 million followers
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.120]  on Facebook and then a month later
[53:18.120 --> 53:20.120]  there's 2 million
[53:20.120 --> 53:22.120]  they do that
[53:22.120 --> 53:24.120]  because you have to pay Facebook
[53:24.120 --> 53:26.120]  but because it's racketeering
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.120]  because it's criminal
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.120]  they don't really advertise it
[53:30.120 --> 53:32.120]  but you have to go by advertising
[53:32.120 --> 53:34.120]  on Facebook
[53:34.120 --> 53:36.120]  then they allow you
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.120]  if you say you've got 2 million people
[53:38.120 --> 53:40.120]  to reach a few more percentage of folks
[53:40.120 --> 53:42.120]  that came and joined
[53:42.120 --> 53:44.120]  because they like you
[53:44.120 --> 53:46.120]  but you're only renting this space from Facebook
[53:46.120 --> 53:48.120]  that isn't even real
[53:48.120 --> 53:50.120]  and so Nugent's talking about it
[53:50.120 --> 53:52.120]  I heard Talk Radio making fun of him
[53:52.120 --> 53:54.120]  Luke Carl
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.120]  kind of making fun of him on XM
[53:58.120 --> 54:00.120]  and so when I got home, I just searched
[54:00.120 --> 54:02.120]  in Facebook, censoring conservatives
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.120]  and found
[54:04.120 --> 54:06.120]  that's probably 40 articles in my hand
[54:06.120 --> 54:08.120]  so I thought I'd get the Motor City Madman
[54:08.120 --> 54:10.120]  on
[54:10.120 --> 54:12.120]  just to talk about censorship
[54:12.120 --> 54:14.120]  and to back up what he's saying and what he was told
[54:14.120 --> 54:16.120]  but
[54:16.120 --> 54:18.120]  the way Facebook works is
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.120]  hey
[54:20.120 --> 54:22.120]  you ought to really be nice to Facebook
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.120]  they'd be nice to you
[54:24.120 --> 54:26.120]  and suddenly videos I was putting out
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  were going from a couple hundred thousand on average
[54:28.120 --> 54:30.120]  to 5, 10 million a piece every time
[54:30.120 --> 54:32.120]  they took the controls off
[54:32.120 --> 54:34.120]  and then I came out and trashed Facebook
[54:34.120 --> 54:36.120]  and all those rights
[54:36.120 --> 54:38.120]  instantly it was taken away
[54:38.120 --> 54:40.120]  instantly that's how this works
[54:40.120 --> 54:42.120]  carrot stick
[54:42.120 --> 54:44.120]  that's fine, I'm there probing Facebook
[54:44.120 --> 54:46.120]  I'm there showing their operations
[54:46.120 --> 54:48.120]  that's what we do
[54:48.120 --> 54:50.120]  it's up to our audience to get this information out
[54:50.120 --> 54:52.120]  ladies and gentlemen
[54:52.120 --> 54:54.120]  you can't be stopped
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.120]  but here is Putin
[54:56.120 --> 54:58.120]  I'm going to have to interpret this
[54:58.120 --> 55:00.120]  it's got subtitles
[55:00.120 --> 55:02.120]  but here it is
[55:02.120 --> 55:04.120]  if it comes with colossal opportunities
[55:04.120 --> 55:06.120]  but also threats that are difficult to predict
[55:08.120 --> 55:10.120]  whoever becomes the leader in this sphere
[55:14.120 --> 55:16.120]  will become the ruler of the world
[55:18.120 --> 55:20.120]  and it would not be very desirable
[55:20.120 --> 55:22.120]  that this monopoly
[55:22.120 --> 55:24.120]  be concentrated in someone's
[55:24.120 --> 55:26.120]  thick hands
[55:26.120 --> 55:28.120]  that's why we become leaders in this area
[55:28.120 --> 55:30.120]  we will share
[55:30.120 --> 55:32.120]  the snow how to the entire world
[55:32.120 --> 55:34.120]  the same way we share our nuclear technologies today
[55:36.120 --> 55:38.120]  but in order not to stand
[55:38.120 --> 55:40.120]  at the end of the line
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.120]  you need to work on it today
[55:44.120 --> 55:46.120]  powerful
[55:48.120 --> 55:50.120]  and I'm not saying Putin's wrong
[55:50.120 --> 55:52.120]  that we shouldn't study AI and whoever comes up
[55:52.120 --> 55:54.120]  will be the leader
[55:56.120 --> 55:58.120]  it's that
[55:58.120 --> 56:00.120]  the way all the other technologies have proliferated
[56:00.120 --> 56:02.120]  been twisted and been used for evil
[56:02.120 --> 56:04.120]  and with how the globalist
[56:04.120 --> 56:06.120]  at least in the west are pushing it
[56:06.120 --> 56:08.120]  is extremist
[56:08.120 --> 56:10.120]  post-industrial world, post-human world
[56:10.120 --> 56:12.120]  why the future doesn't need us
[56:12.120 --> 56:14.120]  I mean these are all mainline white papers
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.120]  that I'm giving you the names of
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.120]  anybody can research what I'm saying
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.120]  and when I talked about this 20 years ago it was weird and cookie
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.120]  now it's all over the news
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.120]  you're like well humans are bad thank god the evolution's about to happen
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.120]  we're all about to be killed
[56:26.120 --> 56:28.120]  we're all bad for the earth
[56:28.120 --> 56:30.120]  I'm like okay professor kill yourself
[56:30.120 --> 56:32.120]  or okay then stop bitching all day about
[56:32.120 --> 56:34.120]  how we're being mean to the dreamers
[56:34.120 --> 56:36.120]  when Mexico doesn't let people come there and be illegal like that
[56:36.120 --> 56:38.120]  oh then you're all hurt
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.120]  selectively because it's all about
[56:40.120 --> 56:42.120]  virtue signaling
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.120]  not actually caring about humanity in the main
[56:44.120 --> 56:46.120]  it's all about lies
[56:46.120 --> 56:48.120]  it's all about dividing humanity
[56:52.120 --> 56:54.120]  so
[56:54.120 --> 56:56.120]  the way this is being deployed
[56:56.120 --> 56:58.120]  even if there's accidents with it
[56:58.120 --> 57:00.120]  it's gonna get out of hand and congress is voting
[57:00.120 --> 57:02.120]  to legalize rubberless cars everywhere
[57:02.120 --> 57:04.120]  they're gonna then pass laws and regulations they're already saying it
[57:04.120 --> 57:06.120]  I knew they'd do it years ago
[57:06.120 --> 57:08.120]  and I said watch they'll claim humans are too dangerous
[57:08.120 --> 57:10.120]  to start taxing us and putting giant
[57:10.120 --> 57:12.120]  insurance costs on top of it
[57:12.120 --> 57:14.120]  and then we'll be made obsolete
[57:14.120 --> 57:16.120]  by the cost, by the cars
[57:16.120 --> 57:18.120]  you say well that's just the future
[57:18.120 --> 57:20.120]  no it isn't because they're designing a future
[57:20.120 --> 57:22.120]  where we'll be removed from
[57:22.120 --> 57:24.120]  decision making and be removed from
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  importance so we can be
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.120]  exited out of the door the decision has been
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  made
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.120]  we're gonna go a break and come back
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.120]  technicians scheduled to call that hotline
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.120]  I should have told the crew I don't think I even told you guys
[57:36.120 --> 57:38.120]  I told you I booked him
[57:38.120 --> 57:40.120]  because I saw it and I called his cell
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.120]  phone
[57:42.120 --> 57:44.120]  so he's coming on to talk about it
[57:44.120 --> 57:46.120]  we're already in an AI we're already in an artificial
[57:46.120 --> 57:48.120]  system that sensors things
[57:48.120 --> 57:50.120]  and controls things behind their computer
[57:50.120 --> 57:52.120]  wall we're already being abused
[57:52.120 --> 57:54.120]  Amazon already knows
[57:54.120 --> 57:56.120]  before you order a product what you're gonna order
[57:56.120 --> 57:58.120]  days before and already has it packaged
[57:58.120 --> 58:00.120]  remember that
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.120]  it already knows you're subconscious it's tracking
[58:02.120 --> 58:04.120]  it it sees the patterns you don't consciously
[58:04.120 --> 58:06.120]  see it it's tracking the patterns
[58:06.120 --> 58:08.120]  that's why you need to support

[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.120]  well the next 30 minutes
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.120]  Ted Nugent is joining us
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.120]  and I really appreciate him joining us today
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:38.120]  I was listening to
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.120]  channel 38 on XM
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.120]  and I heard
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120]  one of the talk show hosts going
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.120]  you know he's the best guitarist ever and we love him but
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.120]  you know he's kind of wacky
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  Uncle Ted claiming facebook
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.120]  censoring him and he's really got
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120]  20 something million but they only showed 2 million
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120]  come on you ought to be glad to have 2 million
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.120]  and then I turned on the news that night
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120]  and you know heard somebody make a snarky comment
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.120]  and I'm like oh yeah there's a hit piece out on Ted Nugent
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120]  I went and printed off
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.120]  no exaggeration like 50 mainstream news articles
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.120]  admitting facebook
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120]  censoring conservatives and libertarians
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.120]  and working with the CIA to do it
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.120]  that's the CIA that Obama still has people in
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.120]  they're working with so I wanted to talk about that
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120]  the state of the country
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120]  the korea situation
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120]  the hurricane
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.120]  later this month he's going out to okinawa
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.120]  to play for the marines
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.120]  so he's going to be close to this whole north korea crisis
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.120]  right in the middle of it
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.120]  and I wanted to get his take on that
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.120]  thanks for coming on sir
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.120]  well I appreciate it Alex
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.120]  first of all we'll keep the spirit ultra buoyant
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120]  and positive by saying happy hunting season

[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.120]  2017
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120]  absolutely this is a short segment longer
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.120]  segment coming up just
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.120]  recapsulate what you were told about what's
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120]  happened to your facebook because I personally
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.120]  check it out all the time and I remember
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120]  it had like 26 million one
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.120]  day I was looking at it a few years ago
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.120]  and then I went back like a month later there was 2 million
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.120]  I've never seen them jack with somebody's
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120]  facebook like yours
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.120]  well truth logic and common
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.120]  sense is what I represent
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.120]  and the leftist and the antifa
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120]  and the electronic
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.120]  goofballs out there in charge of
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120]  social media they can't debate me
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.120]  you know they can't debate me
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.120]  they know they can't debate me because
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.120]  I've got all the evidence all the history
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  all the facts all the data on my
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  side and every time they attempt to debate me
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120]  I eat them alive
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.120]  so they've got to control me
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120]  with their technology and I know for a
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120]  fact I recently had a post on
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.120]  it doesn't even matter what it was about because we talk
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.120]  about everything and anything on my facebook
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.120]  page and I had over 25
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.120]  million responses while
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  facebook claims I only have a three and a half
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.120]  million reach I get a buddy that
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.120]  does well I'm not going to tell you what he does
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120]  all I can tell you is that he knows
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120]  everything about social media and all this
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.120]  technology and he knows for
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120]  fact that I'm between 25
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.120]  and 35 million reach
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120]  on my facebook but facebook
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120]  only admits three and a half million
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.120]  so once again the truth will get
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.120]  out there in spite of those that hate the truth
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.120]  absolutely well
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120]  I had them approach me a few years
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120]  ago and say by advertising
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.120]  and we'll let you actually reach your fans
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.120]  who are trying to get there
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.120]  but they're not putting even though they sign
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.120]  up to want to see your post my post
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120]  they're not letting our post get to them so it's
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.120]  truly sickening but as you said
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.120]  there you are getting 25 million people
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120]  responding but then
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120]  they're saying that you have way less than
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.120]  that when that was just one story
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.120]  that had that they're saying you have less than that in a month
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.120]  you know and
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120]  those controversial moments which you
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120]  don't have to look very hard to find they
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120]  happen every few minutes with the
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.120]  just the fake news outrage
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.120]  that has been attacking me
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.120]  for the last 45 plus years
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.120]  I mean the things they say about me Alex
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.120]  are just
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.120]  insane they just pull stuff out of their ass
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.120]  and make stuff up every day
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.120]  same with me, same with me
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.120]  just the nastiest stuff
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.120]  I'm not going to repeat it here because it's just
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.120]  insane but those people that know me
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.120]  you and I know each other I know people
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.120]  I've been on the road all summer again
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  I did my 6,628
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120]  concert last week
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120]  that's 6,628
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120]  concerts and most importantly Alex
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120]  I don't just do concerts and then
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120]  I order room service
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120]  I have meetings with the community
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120]  everyday Alex
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.120]  all my life, all my career
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.120]  hang out with cops and teachers
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120]  and hardware store operators
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120]  and pipeline CEOs
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120]  and ranchers and welders
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.120]  and bull hunters and deer hunters
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  you've got your finger on the pulse of America
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  Ted Nugent stay there let's talk about the censorship
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.120]  I'll go over some mainstream news articles confirming
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.120]  you're right and then I'm going to ask you
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.120]  what do we do about this because
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.120]  the government forms operators monopolies
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.120]  and they're trying to violate our civil rights
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.120]  what do we do when we have voices
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.120]  to talk about the censorship
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:16.120]  you're so bad
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.120]  independence isn't a day
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120]  it's a mindset
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.120]  an attitude that says I will not be your dependent
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120]  I will not be your slave
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.120]  dependence and slavery is a chain
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.120]  that is forged link by link
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.120]  with gradual infringements
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.120]  when you trade your liberty for safety
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.120]  to that extent you become their slave
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120]  slaves are never safe
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.120]  you won't get rich
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.120]  by being a slave
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.120]  guard your liberty, regard with suspicion

[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.120]  Texas
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.120]  Ted Nugent's with us to the bottom
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.120]  of the hour now again the reason I
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  called him this weekend he was gracious to come on
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.120]  on short notices I listen
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  to some of the channels
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120]  on XM and I like heavy rock
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120]  which now liberal
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120]  homeland security in Canada has said
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.120]  as a sign that you're a
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.120]  racist hate monger that's mainstream news today
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120]  but seriously I
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.120]  like listening to Ted Nugent so I was literally
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120]  tuning in to hear something like Ted Nugent
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120]  and I hear the host making fun
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.120]  of Ted Ted's the best guitarist ever always
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.120]  so wonderful got a bunch of Ted Nugent coming
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  up but he claims he's being censored everybody
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120]  knows that's not happening well
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.120]  I just happened to print more than
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.120]  50 mainstream news articles
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.120]  and while he's talking I'm just going to be
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.120]  showing them for the TV audience but here's a few for radio
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120]  Facebook

[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.120]  Breitbart Info Wars and they admit they are
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.120]  here's the hill
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.120]  report Facebook omit conservative topics
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  from trending list
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120]  Gizmodo former
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120]  Facebook workers we routinely suppress
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.120]  conservative news
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.120]  social media giant organizing trust

[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.120]  and feminist to censor
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  conservative news sites that's right
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.120]  jihad watch has been banned off paypal
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.120]  they're trying to ban us right now
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.120]  but actual jihad groups with
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.120]  Linda Saussure can be on them
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120]  Facebook blacklist trending news

[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.120]  Facebook to decide what's real versus fake news
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.120]  Facebook now last week bans
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120]  conservative advertising Soros
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.120]  financial group helping Facebook flag
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.120]  disputed stories
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120]  this is associated press Reuters

[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.120]  on claims of trending list bans
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.120]  so there's no investigations in congress
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120]  about this I'm going to stop right there
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.120]  because I don't want to waste our time we've got
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.120]  with Ted Nugent here but I want to
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.120]  defending because on TV and radio this
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.120]  weekend and I'm not a big consumer
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.120]  of TV and radio
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120]  I heard him being trashed because
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.120]  there's a talking point out they don't
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.120]  want somebody one of the top rock stars
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.120]  ever sells sold out shows everywhere
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  loved across the board
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.120]  hundreds of millions of fans on the internet
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120]  to have
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  his word you know out there about being
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.120]  censored they want to make a joke about it
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  to discredit everybody when they admit
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120]  their censoring so that's why this is a big deal
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.120]  it is happening
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.120]  and we're going to discuss it Google Facebook
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.120]  Twitter they're all censoring libertarians
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.120]  conservatives they've been censoring Trump's
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120]  Twitter feed drudge they've been
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120]  calling his
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.120]  information inappropriate
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120]  when it's links to jobs numbers and stuff
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120]  or to NASA reporting on
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120]  an asteroid they are censoring
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120]  all of us at an alarming rate they admit
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.120]  they are so Ted Nugent
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.120]  what do we do about it
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.120]  well you do what I do what you do
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.120]  you raise hell you know I've talked about
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120]  this so many times before but the
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.120]  the media is so infested
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.120]  with anti-Americanism
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120]  they literally
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.120]  scoff and mock at me and you
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120]  in the Constitution the Bill of Rights
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.120]  and those great American
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.120]  rednecks that saved all those people
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120]  in Corpus Christi in Houston
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.120]  in Louisiana I just wrote another article
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.120]  I write for a dozen or so publications
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.120]  including deer and deerhunting.com
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.120]  now if everybody
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.120]  would think about that deer
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.120]  and deerhunting.com
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.120]  I weave in the politics
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.120]  that is the tip of the culture war
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.120]  spear which is anti-gun
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.120]  anti-hunting, anti-independence
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.120]  anti-rugged individualism
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.120]  and those are the people that saved
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.120]  all those people in
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.120]  the Harvey aftermath and in fact
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.120]  it's still going on. Those are duck hunters
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.120]  those are deer hunters those are NRA members
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.120]  I just couldn't get over it
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.120]  Alex that even on CNN and
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.120]  some of the anti-American
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.120]  fake newsmasters
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.120]  they would show these guys in these lifted pickup trucks
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120]  in these mossy oak camouflage
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.120]  boats saving people of
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.120]  every ethnicity, every color
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120]  every walk of life and they would
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120]  have t-shirts with crossed AR-15s
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  and say mail en route
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.120]  come and get them. So they couldn't
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.120]  censor
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.120]  the live reports that what you and I
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120]  represent is the heart
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.120]  and soul of this country
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.120]  so they have to make fun of me
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.120]  and if you've noticed only after
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.120]  I'm done with the interview
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.120]  they never challenge me when I'm
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.120]  on the air with them because they know
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.120]  I'll eat them alive
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.120]  because I've got all the facts
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.120]  all the data, all the history
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.120]  all the current and historical information
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120]  to make my point because it's not
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.120]  my point itself if in truth
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.120]  logic and common sense which
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.120]  the mainstream media
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.120]  is allergic to so we the people
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.120]  individuals have to
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.120]  constantly hammer our elected
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.120]  employees to remind them
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.120]  to get the Trump
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.120]  agenda accomplished
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.120]  you and I talked
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.120]  many years ago that the number one curse
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.120]  in America was not
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.120]  the gun running team of Obama
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.120]  and Holder and the liberals and the
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  anti-Americans taken over our government
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.120]  in academia and media
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.120]  it's we the people who don't
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.120]  come to the forefront, don't stand
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.120]  on the front lines of this experiment
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.120]  self-government and demand
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.120]  accountability, ultimately
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.120]  constitutional
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.120]  accountability from our elected employees
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.120]  so the real curse
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.120]  in America isn't the enemy that's winning
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.120]  in media and academia
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.120]  and too often in government
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.120]  even though now we've got the right
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.120]  administration or we could talk about that
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.120]  those are all my guys
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120]  with Trump, those are all
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.120]  real American working
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.120]  hard playing hard constitutionalist
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120]  but we the people, each individual American
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  has to have a constant
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120]  and a consistent communication
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.120]  with our senator, our congressman
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.120]  our mayor, our governor and the
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.120]  White House showing the support
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  for the common sense agenda of President
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.120]  Donald Trump, crushing
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.120]  the status quo
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120]  that has ruined everything
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120]  in this great country of ours
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120]  Wow, Ted Nugent is on fire as
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120]  usual when is he not in Fuego
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.120]  we have several
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120]  videos we shot in Austin last week
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.120]  in Houston and in Austin
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.120]  where
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.120]  and some of these videos have like 10, 12
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120]  14 million views a piece because it's so incredible
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.120]  we show the loving, caring
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.120]  people of all race colors
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.120]  and creeds coming together in Houston
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.120]  and then we show the protesters
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.120]  against Trump coming that the media kind of
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.120]  ignored because they knew this looked bad
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.120]  and they are the most hateful, evil
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.120]  vicious people
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.120]  and then we've had reporters in
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.120]  the situation in Virginia
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.120]  three weeks ago and
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.120]  out in San Francisco when the
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.120]  Antifa shows up throwing feces
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  urine, beating people, attacking folks
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.120]  and Trump says hey the white supremacists are bad
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.120]  but so is the Antifa
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.120]  and the media says he's evil and wrong
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120]  but now three weeks later Pelosi
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.120]  and all of them
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.120]  have had to come out
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.120]  and admit
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.120]  that indeed
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.120]  it's true and Antifa has now been
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.120]  listed as a terrorist organization
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120]  so they've absolutely
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.120]  had to eat crow and admit that Trump
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.120]  was right when he came out and said
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.120]  both sides were wrong
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.120]  and Alex that's the manifestation
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.120]  of what I just said is what
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.120]  we're supposed to do believe me
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120]  Pelosi is the enemy
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120]  Maxine Waters I don't even know what
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  planet she's from I mean the
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.120]  Democrats, the left, the liberals
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.120]  these are strange, bizarre
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.120]  anti-logic, anti-American
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.120]  freaks
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.120]  each and every one of them
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.120]  if you just watch Maxine
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.120]  water try to find a syllable
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.120]  and you can actually say I'm
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.120]  on her side that's a
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120]  direct result of we the people
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120]  electing Donald Trump and showing
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120]  support for Donald Trump that even
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.120]  those freaks like Pelosi
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120]  they have to acquiesce
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.120]  that's the perfect example of when
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120]  we the people put pressure on our elected
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.120]  employees that even the worst
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.120]  of the worst like Pelosi
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.120]  they have to finally admit
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.120]  that those that are anti-fascists
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.120]  are the fascists
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.120]  incredible
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.120]  the president condemns all violence
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.120]  the left finds fault
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.120]  with all life's matter
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.120]  and the condemning of all violence
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.120]  I mean this is planet of the apes
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.120]  cuckoo's nest, day glow, orange clock
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.120]  work, mad magazine, twilight
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.120]  zone stuff so we the people
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.120]  are actually getting
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.120]  are comeuppance by the fact that
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.120]  Pelosi had to admit her people
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.120]  are the evil, hateful
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.120]  violent people
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120]  exactly how big of a victory
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.120]  because Trump didn't do a victory lap
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.120]  he was too busy with Hurricane Harvey
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]  and I follow your Facebook I saw
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:16.120]  you did a few posts on it but as libertarians
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.120]  as conservatives it's just common sense
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.120]  Americana like you say working hard
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.120]  playing hard red-blooded you know humans
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.120]  who aren't sissies and who
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.120]  aren't trying to be victims we have kind
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:28.120]  of a problem though we always get proven right
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.120]  we keep moving forward and we never double
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.120]  back and say see we were right we just
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.120]  did it there but I think more and
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.120]  more we've got to kind of point out to folks
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.120]  that listen listen you know
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.120]  folks promote Americana
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.120]  know what we're talking about you want to
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.120]  live in North Korea you want to live in Venezuela
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.120]  get your ass down there stop bitching
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.120]  and complaining why the Pelosi
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.120]  and Michael Moore want to mount
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.120]  America's head on the wall
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.120]  why did they in their own internal documents
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.120]  more of them come out in emails talking about how much they
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.120]  hate America and hate God
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.120]  and hate prosperity and Hillary calls
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.120]  her supporters dumb basement
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.120]  dwellers and talks about how they want free stuff
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.120]  well lady that's what you advertise
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.120]  you know at least we tell folks don't try to get free
[01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.120]  stuff nothing's ever free she says
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.120]  she's got free stuff and then hates her own
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:14.120]  poor constituents
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.120]  well that's that's why your
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:18.120]  spotlight on the cockroaches
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.120]  Alec is so important
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.120]  that's really what we do people that's what
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:24.120]  our job is as experimenters and
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.120]  self-government to spotlight
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.120]  the cockroaches you perfected
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.120]  that over the years into my own little
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.120]  guitar playing world
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.120]  I mean I just wrapped up the greatest tour
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.120]  of my life with the most amazing
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.120]  music and the band and the crowd
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.120]  and my crew every night
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.120]  was just phenomenal all summer
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.120]  and now I'm taking it to Okinawa
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.120]  for the ultimate rock and roll concert
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.120]  for the United States Marine Corps
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:50.120]  just just downwind of young
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.120]  one I don't know
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.120]  what buttons to push there but you're absolutely
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.120]  correct the manifestation
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.120]  of a cultural deprivation
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.120]  is the fact that
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.120]  the spotlight has finally hit
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.120]  the right cockroaches because
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.120]  Donald Trump represents a crowbar
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.120]  upside the head of
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.120]  status quo politics
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.120]  he represents the lights coming on
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.120]  at midnight
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.120]  absolutely that's what our job is
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120]  look I don't want to
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.120]  toot your horn but this is real strategy
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120]  you on the NRA board
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.120]  were able to get a more hardcore and more like
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.120]  Donald is America
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.120]  and you were somebody that pushed for that
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.120]  and now the NRA is more amazing than ever
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.120]  best organization on earth in my view
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.120]  but there are a lot of folks
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.120]  and conservatives that still get intimidated
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.120]  by kind of the main line
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.120]  neocon or rhino stuff
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.120]  that oh Ted Nugent's a little extreme
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.120]  oh Alex Jones he's way extreme
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.120]  then they miss quote who we are but if they really
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.120]  pay attention
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.120]  you more than anybody you said your little corner guitar
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.120]  you are
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.120]  and a Nigel Farage or Ron Paul
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.120]  you know certainly so libertarians are myself
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.120]  I mean there's only
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.120]  five or six seven big guys
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.120]  that are out front and you
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.120]  before Trump came along were the
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.120]  biggest standard bearer
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.120]  for conservative libertarian Americana
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.120]  a god guns and guts and just a fact
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.120]  and then
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.120]  I don't mince words I don't play games
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.120]  I know that I don't have to defend
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.120]  my right to hunt I celebrate it
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.120]  I don't have to defend my right
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.120]  to bear arms I promote it and celebrate it
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.120]  the NRA will tell you
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.120]  that the reason I get more votes than any
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:28.120]  member of the board of directors
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.120]  pretty much 90% of them
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.120]  is because I don't play games and I don't
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.120]  adjust my tie and I'm not worried about
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.120]  the words that I use I come from the streets
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.120]  of Detroit and I know that words
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.120]  matter and I know how real America
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.120]  talks and I talk about those camouflage
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.120]  guys in those duck boats
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.120]  saving innocent lives down in Houston
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.120]  and Corpus Christi and Louisiana
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.120]  those are the Ted Nugent American
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.120]  working hard playing hard
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.120]  and that's where I was going that's where I was going
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.120]  is that it's people like you and Charlton Heston
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.120]  that made us what we are today
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:00.120]  that took us over this hump
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.120]  where we have a fighting chance against the
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.120]  collectivist and then to sit there and watch
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.120]  kind of the establishment Republicans act like
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.120]  you're an outsider Trump's an outsider
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:10.120]  when you and others have brought them
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.120]  Congress the awakening the guys in the
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.120]  duck boats all of us together and then to
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.120]  still have the blue blood Republicans the
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.120]  looking down their noses at us
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.120]  when you are the guy that reformed the
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.120]  NRA you're the guy that we can
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.120]  really over probably turning the whole
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.120]  second amendment battle around that and Charlton
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.120]  Heston before you who I know you work closely
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.120]  with so that said I'm asking you
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.120]  to really realize
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.120]  that I understand
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.120]  yourself deprecating and you don't want to
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.120]  put your own horn but Ted other than
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120]  Trump you're one
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.120]  of the main leaders out there so I'm
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.120]  just asking you to use that great brain you've got
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.120]  to think of what you can do more
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.120]  to general people into being
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.120]  more aggressive so that the week need
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.120]  Republicans don't basically win the day
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.120]  I'm asking you the same thing I did ten years ago
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.120]  I said please get in there and kick some ass to the NRA
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.120]  and it's not that I asked you so you did it
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:00.120]  a lot of folks were doing it but I'm saying you
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.120]  cleaned up the NRA can you can you help us clean up
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.120]  the Republicans
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.120]  absolutely I see it happening all the time I was
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.120]  with a gal on
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.120]  Fox television last week a couple weeks ago
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.120]  when I was wrapping up the tour in New York City
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.120]  and her name is Lena
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.120]  Epstein
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:18.120]  and she's a hellraiser
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.120]  and she understands
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.120]  that we got to get back to the brass
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.120]  the brass tax we got to get back
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.120]  to the right to keep and bear arms
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.120]  not to be infringed we don't need
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.120]  any government paperwork for our first
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120]  amendment and we sure as hell
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:34.120]  shouldn't need any government paperwork for our
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.120]  second amendment I don't need a permit
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.120]  to carry a gun I got that right
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.120]  from God and the Constitution guarantees it
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.120]  that's all the permits I need
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.120]  and this kind of gal should be running
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.120]  against Debbie Stabenow one of Nancy Pelosi
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.120]  and Maxine Waters buddies
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.120]  here in the once reliably blue state
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.120]  of Michigan how embarrassing can you a bit
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.120]  get to be a reliably blue state
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.120]  but we proved they were wrong when Michigan
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.120]  and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin came to the
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.120]  forum we voted for Donald Trump
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.120]  because he's a hellraiser
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.120]  we the people are supposed to be
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.120]  hellraisers we're not supposed to act
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.120]  like French and Canadians
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.120]  with all due respect to my friends in Canada
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.120]  but we don't bend over
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.120]  we stand up and we demand
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.120]  constitutional accountability and I see
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.120]  that hellraising increasing all the time
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.120]  Alex and you certainly were a leader
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120]  on that front we salute you for that
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.120]  because to be an extremist to be
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120]  radical are like those Americans
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120]  who went to Concord Bridge from the British
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.120]  we're going to take our guns and we didn't sit down
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.120]  and have tea with them we shot them in the damn head
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.120]  we killed them you come to take
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.120]  our way our guns we'll cut you in half
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:38.120]  somebody write that down
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:40.120]  and that's the battle cry that's going to get
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.120]  all of our rights back that's going to get
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.120]  rugged individualism back self-sufficiency
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.120]  real independence we don't want to
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.120]  take stuff we want to provide
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.120]  stuff and that's the new battle cry
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.120]  that Donald Trump represents and Matt
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120]  mad dog matters and sinky
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.120]  and and and and all
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.120]  the entire staff of
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.120]  President Obama are the guys that I
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.120]  would share a hunting campfire with
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.120]  literally
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.120]  imagine having Obama you know Obama
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.120]  sent this letter I don't know if you've seen it
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.120]  to Trump back in
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:12.120]  January and now leaked it so it's a private letter
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.120]  so he leaks it how classy
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.120]  and in and he says listen your job
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.120]  is to sustain the world government order
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.120]  he actually says your job
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.120]  is to keep the international
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.120]  order in place and then America's only part
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.120]  of it what a treasonous letter
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.120]  and that's why they're so upset that Trump's had
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.120]  success with the stock market and had
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.120]  success with new jobs and is turning
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.120]  the economy around with a 3.0
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.120]  growth rate something they said
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.120]  Trump could never do because Obama never
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.120]  did it
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.120]  well and the writing is on the wall
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:44.120]  you look at my wonderful birth city of
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.120]  Detroit was the work ethic epic
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.120]  epicenter the productivity epicenter
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.120]  of the globe when I was born in
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.120]  1948 until mayor Coleman
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.120]  young and the liberal democrats took over
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.120]  and trained people brainwashed people
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.120]  desold the people
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.120]  that you don't have to try you just
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.120]  stay home or you go ahead and make
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.120]  Chrysler products that won't even run
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.120]  and will still send you a bonus check
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.120]  well when you give people
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.120]  something you turn them into
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.120]  zombies the worst thing you can
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.120]  do to a human being is to give
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.120]  him stuff
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.120]  because then he has no pride of work
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.120]  ethic or ownership or earning
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.120]  his own way and I see that
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:24.120]  reverse nowadays I see that
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.120]  work ethic and that that drive
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.120]  to make America strong by making our
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.120]  families strong in our neighborhoods
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.120]  strong by being the most productive
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.120]  most quality control person you can
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.120]  be that's the downward Trump army
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.120]  and I'm proud to be a part of it
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.120]  absolutely I don't know if you saw this
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:42.120]  but Phil Mudd a big democrat
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.120]  and a guy appointed to the FBI
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.120]  deputy director ship from the CIA
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:48.120]  by Obama
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.120]  he came out on CNN
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.120]  a month ago and said we're going to kill
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.120]  Trump that's a quote we're going to kill
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.120]  him and there's all this talk about
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.120]  killing him outside of impeachment
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.120]  all this talk at high levels
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.120]  about trying to claim
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.120]  these mentally ill or something
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.120]  what do you make of that
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.120]  well I've been dealing with these freaks
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.120]  I mean we've always fight our security
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.120]  on tour because people have threatened to kill me
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.120]  because I murder innocent
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.120]  animals
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.120]  I don't even know
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.120]  what to make of that your brain's
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.120]  got to be 90% LSD
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.120]  to think that
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.120]  murdering innocent animals
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.120]  is what we do to feed the human species
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.120]  that's like so bizarre
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  I just laughed at it however
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.120]  these freaks are serious and they threaten
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.120]  to kill our family because we hunt
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:38.120]  because we believe in the second amendment
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.120]  because we trounce and spotlight
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.120]  the cockroaches on the left that hate
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  American hate the constitution hate the
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  American dream hate independence
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.120]  why do they hate it why do they hate it
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.120]  why what's their problem
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.120]  there I got to tell you Alex I grew
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.120]  up with these people I'll be 69 in a couple
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.120]  months and I grew up with these people
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.120]  who are running the media that are
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.120]  entrenched in the government right now
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:02.120]  these are dope smokers
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.120]  they make no
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120]  sense their logic meter
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.120]  is pinned in the off position
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.120]  that you listen to Al
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.120]  Frank and talk you listen to Bill
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120]  Maher talk you watch Nancy Pelosi
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.120]  try to form a syllable
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.120]  and you you've got to know that these
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.120]  people are brain dead
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.120]  and they're in it for their own selfish
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.120]  reasons
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.120]  to I mean look at Maxine
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.120]  water she has how many mansions
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  and she represents the
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.120]  downtrodden of Los Angeles but she doesn't
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.120]  even live in her
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.120]  in the residency of her constituency
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.120]  I mean there's so many glaring examples
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.120]  of what the left misrepresents
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.120]  and the dishonesty and the deceit
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.120]  so if you have the audacity
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.120]  to stand up for working and
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:48.120]  earning your own way and living within your means
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.120]  and save for a rainy day and put your nose
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.120]  to the grindstone and be the best that
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.120]  you can be it interferes
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.120]  with their brainwashing and their
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  racism they like to keep
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.120]  certain certain members of our society
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.120]  under their thumb
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  so they will vote for them
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.120]  and they will be able to benefit
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.120]  from that so it's pretty obvious
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.120]  unless you're one of them
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.120]  and that's why Donald Trump represents
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.120]  a complete sucker punch
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.120]  into the status quo of the
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.120]  entrenched politics that has
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.120]  ruined everything in this country
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.120]  and we were talking there in the break and I gotta go
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.120]  please come back soon we were talking about the media
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.120]  the lies they say about you about me
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:28.120]  folks you gotta know you're something about Ted Nugent
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.120]  or anybody else that's a patriot
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.120]  you need to see the video for yourself
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.120]  don't just believe it when they put it in print
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.120]  you were telling me some amazing lies
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120]  they put out against you
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:40.120]  it's just the starters they constantly say
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.120]  that I dodged the draft I didn't dodge the draft
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.120]  I did an interview with some stone freak
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.120]  high times magazine
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.120]  and I referenced the story of my drummer
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.120]  KJ Knight who was a dear friend of mine
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.120]  who went through all kinds of fall to roll
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.120]  to avoid the draft and it was so damn
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.120]  funny back then I gave that story
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.120]  to high time because
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:00.120]  Alex they never got the band members
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.120]  names right they never got the instruments
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.120]  right they never got the song titles right
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120]  they never got the date right
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.120]  they never got the facility right they were all
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.120]  stone idiots and that
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.120]  old lie that first lie gets
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.120]  regurgitated more and more like it's true
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.120]  it's just absolutely fun
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.120]  listen I
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.120]  couldn't have avoided the draft I was
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.120]  Superman when I was 19 years old
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:24.120]  I used to literally I'm not making this up
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.120]  I would hurdle folks wagons
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.120]  just to show off
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.120]  I was so athletic and so wire I was already
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.120]  a sniper
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:34.120]  Ted I know you've got to go but I want you to be able to finish this
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.120]  if you've got to go I understand if you do five more minutes
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.120]  with us I can absolutely
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.120]  we'll be right back Ted Nugent I'm Alex Jones
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.120]  we were talking about some of the stuff they
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.120]  claimed about him it just it just shows who they are
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.120]  we're on the march
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.120]  the empires on the run that's right the
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.120]  communist empires on the run and the GCN
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.120]  radio network
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.120]  James Madison the father of the bill of rights
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120]  wrote we're in excess of power prevails
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.120]  property of no sort is
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.120]  duly respected no man is safe in his
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.120]  opinions in his person in his
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.120]  faculties or in his possessions
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.120]  is there any question that we have in excess
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.120]  of power in Washington the only question
[01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.120]  is how do we contain it
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:16.120]  and how do we remove that power from
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.120]  Washington to our local communities
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:20.120]  to the individual that is
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.120]  the ultimate concern the concentration
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.120]  of power the excess of power was always
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.120]  the chief concern of
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.120]  the founders of this country it was why the
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.120]  anti-fiddle is to pose the Constitution
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.120]  they believe they put safeguards in the
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.120]  Constitution to abuse that concentration of power
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.120]  but as James Madison also pointed out
[01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.120]  knowledge will forever govern
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.120]  ignorance of people who mean to be their
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.120]  own governors must arm themselves
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.120]  with the power that knowledge gives
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.120]  arm yourself with the information of what
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.120]  your rulers are doing of what the real
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.120]  constraints upon them are only then

[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.120]  Thousands of
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:00.120]  years ago there was a basic form
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.120]  of chivalry. Our ancestors
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.120]  would hear the drums of war
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.120]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.120]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.120]  60 years ago
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.120]  when foreign air forces were
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.120]  approaching filled with bombs
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.120]  they had drums of their own
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.120]  air raid sirens. But in the 21st
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.120]  century there are silent
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.120]  weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.120]  Pathogens added to the food and water
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.120]  into the lining of plastics that destroy
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.120]  our vitality turn off our
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:30.120]  hormones and accelerate our journey
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:32.120]  towards death. I personally
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.120]  counter this onslaught with
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.120]  Anthroplex. Anthroplex
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:38.120]  is designed with known
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.120]  organic concentrated herbs
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:42.120]  to create the basic foundation
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.120]  to normal metabolic activity
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.120]  inside the human body. Discover
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.120]  why Anthroplex has turned so many heads
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.120]  today. It's time for us to take
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.120]  our bodies back into our own hands
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.120]  and it starts at infowarslife.com
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:58.120]  with Anthroplex.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.120]  You know, that liner is many years old
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:20.120]  but now that we have Trump as president
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:22.120]  we have a beachhead. If we keep taking the country back
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.120]  it's all my liners. But you saw
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.120]  Texas isn't perfect but Texans are known
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:28.120]  to respond to disasters and known
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.120]  to shoot you straight.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.120]  But look
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.120]  there's those type of values from Northern California
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.120]  to Michigan to Illinois
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.120]  to Florida to Georgia to New York City
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.120]  it's the media bullying
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.120]  everybody to be afraid
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:44.120]  to say we're just patriots
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.120]  we love America we love free market
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.120]  we don't want to live in North Korea
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.120]  Ted Nugent with us a few more
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.120]  minutes breaking down
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:54.120]  all the things that are happening in our country
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.120]  in our world. How long
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.120]  can this media bullying
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:00.120]  continue when it's blowing up in their
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.120]  face everywhere, Ted?
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:04.120]  Well, it's deeply entrenched
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.120]  as a direct result of the dope smoke in
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.120]  60s and 70s where that generation
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.120]  is now in charge of the fake news
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.120]  monster out there. But I gotta tell you
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:14.120]  on a positive note
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:16.120]  we know that there's always gonna be good, bad and ugly
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.120]  and it's important to maximize
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.120]  the good by identifying
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.120]  and going after the bad and the ugly
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.120]  and I just wrapped up in 2017
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.120]  Alex I'm gonna be
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.120]  69 years old I had the
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.120]  greatest most musically
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.120]  outrageous and adventurous
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.120]  fun tour of my life
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.120]  and when we play across California
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.120]  when we play across New York
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:40.120]  and New Jersey and Maryland and Massachusetts
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.120]  Illinois when you play
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.120]  what they think are blue
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.120]  states there are no blue
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.120]  states there are
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.120]  America is
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.120]  50 states red but you have
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.120]  high crime
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.120]  Democrat run
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.120]  blue smudges and wherever this
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.120]  hardcore redneck right wing
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.120]  Ted Nugent NRA board of
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.120]  director for 26 years guy
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.120]  rocks out people in
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:08.120]  California, New York and New Jersey
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:10.120]  and Maryland Massachusetts and Maryland
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.120]  all these so called blue states
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:14.120]  it's like a homecoming Alex
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.120]  I can't find a liberal animal
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.120]  rights freak of course
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:20.120]  they part like the red sea before Moses
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.120]  when I come to town they're scared to death
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.120]  of me even though they threatened to kill me
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.120]  on the social media they haven't got the balls
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.120]  of the to that capability
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.120]  to confront me in person the bottom
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.120]  line is there's so much
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.120]  constitutional
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.120]  integrity
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.120]  American dream being the best that you
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.120]  can be it is everywhere
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.120]  so the answer to your question is
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.120]  nobody's going to know
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.120]  until we we continue
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.120]  to hammer the liars at
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.120]  CNN and all the fake news
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.120]  monsters and the liberals who
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.120]  continue to rape and pillage
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:56.120]  the Constitution and freedom
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.120]  until we the people do to
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.120]  the country and politics in the media
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:02.120]  what we did in Houston
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.120]  Corpus Christi Louisiana
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.120]  to show them that the gun nuts
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.120]  the NRA members the hunters
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.120]  the fishermen the
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.120]  outdoorsmen the rednecks
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.120]  the people like you and me
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.120]  people who bust their
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.120]  ass to be in the asset column
[01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.120]  every day until we
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.120]  put enough pressure on the media
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.120]  that we're not going to listen to their crap anymore
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.120]  and we're not going to put up with antifun
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.120]  Black Lives Matter terrorists anymore
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:30.120]  until that time comes
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.120]  we're going to have to deal with them
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.120]  but let me just tell everybody
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.120]  if we treat politics
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:38.120]  the way we treated
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.120]  McCain and Romney because
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:42.120]  they brought doilies to a grenade fight
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.120]  they didn't represent Jack Squat
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.120]  to bring back constitutionalism
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120]  in this country until we
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.120]  do what we did with
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.120]  Donald Trump and we finally came
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.120]  to the front lines and
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.120]  Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.120]  what you're saying is this stop being intimidated
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120]  we're in a war we're always Ted Nugent stop singing
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.120]  it's a war Stephen Bannon stop singing
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.120]  it's a war Alex Jones stop calling
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.120]  an info war it's a war
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.120]  exactly they want us to stop
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.120]  telling the truth because
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:12.120]  they're in war against us look at the WikiLeaks
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  yeah it's pretty
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.120]  I can tell you Alex you're doing God's work
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.120]  and spotlighting cockroaches
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.120]  one of my greatest sports in the world
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.120]  that's what the founding fathers wanted
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.120]  the founding fathers wanted everybody
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.120]  to be like Ted Nugent and Alex Jones
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.120]  to question authority
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.120]  to question and demand
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.120]  constitutional accountability from all
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.120]  elected employees
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.120]  just the fact that I came up with the term
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.120]  elected employees
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:40.120]  and like you do
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.120]  support the good
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:44.120]  employees with our full backing
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.120]  another part of the equation so in closings you gotta go I know
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.120]  I wanted to hit two more topics
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.120]  you're being censored I'm being censored
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.120]  they admit they're censoring as a group
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.120]  libertarians conservatives congressman Rohrbacher
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:56.120]  others are saying
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.120]  this is racketeering this is civil rights
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:00.120]  violations you know imagine
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.120]  if they didn't let blacks
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:04.120]  publish you know uh
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.120]  letters to the editor
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.120]  that's what's happening to conservatives across the board
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.120]  it's very evil so thank you for speaking out
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.120]  about facebook blocking you from your own
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.120]  internal IT which we've experienced
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.120]  which they admit they're doing
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.120]  but that's why people need to visit
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.120]  TedNugent.com and make it their home page
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.120]  their info wars.com

[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.120]  whoever you go to
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.120]  their safety in numbers were growing
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.120]  but we're in a real war
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:32.120]  we're blocking us sharing our facebook post
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.120]  we can post it to our page
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:36.120]  but it doesn't get to you
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.120]  97% reduction
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.120]  they don't let us share the articles
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.120]  and then they force
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.120]  feed Zuckerberg
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:46.120]  and his anti-guine open borders
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.120]  globalism to all 3 billion
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.120]  people or whatever are on facebook

[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.120]  people need to know yes we're on these sites
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.120]  that are censoring us because they're big
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.120]  they're important we're fighting
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.120]  but we've got to have our own home bases
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.120]  that are supported
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:06.120]  your comments on that Ted
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.120]  well number one a thank to everybody out there

[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.120]  but if you want to feel the heart and soul
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.120]  of positive constitutional
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.120]  Bill of Rights Ten Commandments
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.120]  Golden Rule will be the best that you can be

[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.120]  yeah but bottom line is you'll see
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  that common sense is alive
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.120]  and well out there the work ethic that
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.120]  makes this country the greatest quality
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.120]  of life in the world it's alive and well
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:38.120]  and I want to thank everybody who does come

[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.120]  because that positive energy
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.120]  is indefatigable
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.120]  it is unstoppable
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.120]  and we need to grow so all of us that already
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:50.120]  know the truth and that
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  abide by the American dream work ethic
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.120]  we need to kind of consult
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.120]  and cast eyes in school
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.120]  and our family and friends and co-workers
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:00.120]  people at church and school to get on
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:02.120]  board join the NRA
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:04.120]  be an NRA member nothing drives the left
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.120]  more baddie than
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:08.120]  NRA membership so
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120]  so that's the kind of stuff we're doing
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.120]  it really does make a difference that's right
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  don't think that you can run around
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.120]  you know save the world you know overnight
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.120]  so you don't do anything no folks
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.120]  every little bit together many hands make
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.120]  like work final final point with TedNugent
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.120]  this is out of the daily caller
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:26.120]  I went to the Democratic Party groups it's true
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.120]  also the Washington
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.120]  Times is reporting it anti-Trump
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.120]  resistance groups spreading North Korean propaganda
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:34.120]  and then I found the hill
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.120]  today blames Trump
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:38.120]  for the North Korea crisis
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:40.120]  and even misquotes Putin criticizing
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:42.120]  Trump we went to the actual quote
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.120]  Putin didn't even say Trump
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.120]  so what do you make
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:48.120]  of our own I mean these traders
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.120]  now siding against America with North Korea
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:52.120]  well certainly
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.120]  I'm glad the term fake news
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:56.120]  has finally been documented because I've been dealing
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:58.120]  with it for the last 45 50
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.120]  years but it's fake
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.120]  news and if you if you know about the
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:04.120]  rules for radical and the
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.120]  Solowlisky that tutored Hillary Clinton
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:08.120]  so she could write her law degree thesis
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.120]  at Columbia
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.120]  with under the
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.120]  the teachings of Solowlisky
[01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.120]  that's the rules for radicals
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.120]  they have to lie because they know
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.120]  that if Americans
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:22.120]  who believe in the Constitution
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.120]  and genuine independence if they
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.120]  if they are constantly
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  bombarded with lies and fake news
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.120]  there's enough naive and weak
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.120]  and gullible people out there that'll fall
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.120]  for it and that's where you get
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.120]  Antifa and Black Lives Matter
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.120]  and that's where you get the undocumented
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.120]  immigrants who are voting Democrat
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.120]  I've got the answers to that we should do another show
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:44.120]  soon because I know how to end all of that
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.120]  right now
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.120]  we the people in the asset column
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:50.120]  we've got to raise more hell spotlight
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.120]  more cockroaches and communicate more
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.120]  effectively and consistently
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.120]  with our elected employees
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.120]  that's right and we just spotlighted
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.120]  Facebook's admin censorship
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.120]  and more for folks making jokes about it
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.120]  that people know the truth and those making jokes
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.120]  have now been identified in the cockroach column
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.120]  versus the Ted Nugent
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.120]  plus column I'll just say this
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:12.120]  Lou Dobbs a month ago said the Democrats
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.120]  the globalists are trying to break our will
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:16.120]  they want to destroy Trump to break our will
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.120]  it's not going to happen
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:20.120]  they will never break our will and a big part
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.120]  of that chain at the heart of that will
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.120]  is the engine that is the motor
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.120]  city madman Ted Nugent
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.120]  Ted you're awesome thank you
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.120]  thanks Alex God bless America
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:32.120]  God bless the US Marine Corps we're rocking them
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:34.120]  in Okinawa next week
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.120]  alright you'll be right there close to Kim Jong-un
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.120]  thank you
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.120]  there goes Ted Nugent always great
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.120]  always great to have him with us
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.120]  now Joy Vila is joining us
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.120]  along with
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.120]  Kaya Jones
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.120]  I pronounce that right I love her music
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.120]  I've watched her for a long time
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.120]  about how they got
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.120]  censored on YouTube two weeks ago
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.120]  and blocked and their monetization
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.120]  killed same thing happened with the next guest coming on
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.120]  and they can overlap with her because I got them on
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.120]  late Candace Owens
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.120]  she was on last week she has the
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.120]  red pill black
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.120]  she got demonetized
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:12.120]  her videos were removed after she came on
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:14.120]  so this is going on
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  but they all made a big deal about it
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.120]  Miss Jones
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:20.120]  Miss Villa Miss Owens
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.120]  and it blew up in their face
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.120]  KayaJones.com
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.120]  JoyVila.com
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:28.120]  you can follow them on Twitter
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.120]  this is a big deal
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.120]  because these ladies are not saying
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.120]  anything that I would even call
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:36.120]  controversial I mean they're just
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:38.120]  well spoken they're pretty they have nice music
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.120]  they've had songs
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.120]  that are in the top of the charts
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.120]  that's why they're being censored that's why
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.120]  they're being attacked is because they're effective
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:48.120]  and they're successful
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.120]  and so
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.120]  this is why you hear about conservatives
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.120]  having to have secret societies in LA
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.120]  I know some of the top directors top producers
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:00.120]  who
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:02.120]  literally have to meet in secret
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:04.120]  or they'd be blocked in black bolt
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:06.120]  I mean folks that have produced films that cost
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.120]  300 million dollars TV shows that cost
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.120]  300 million dollars you know top of the line
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:12.120]  I know five or six big producers
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.120]  and none of them are Republican
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.120]  or Democrat they're just libertarian they love America
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.120]  they don't like hating America they don't
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.120]  like trying to destroy the country
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.120]  and
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.120]  they get run out of Hollywood
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.120]  who's the famous director
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.120]  who did Conan the Barbarian
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:30.120]  and he also wrote the Dirty Harry stuff
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.120]  and he did Red Dawn
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:34.120]  I was just reading about his story
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:36.120]  he was a top producer
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.120]  top director
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.120]  but he loved America so they
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.120]  basically blackballed him
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.120]  I'm gonna leave it at that before I go any further
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.120]  the point is that
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.120]  there's so much happening but they didn't want to come on about that
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:50.120]  they wanted to come on about it before
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.120]  but now YouTube left them alone
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.120]  so I understand they don't want to sit there and bitch about
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:56.120]  YouTube because now YouTube backed off
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:58.120]  but it's only because they did complain
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:00.120]  we have to be aware of that
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.120]  they got saved from the wolves
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:04.120]  and everybody came to their aid
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.120]  but the wolves are out there banning people
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.120]  blocking people every day
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.120]  it's Joy Vila
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.120]  and it's Miss Jones
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:14.120]  last week it's
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:16.120]  the Motor City Madman this week
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.120]  so ladies great to have you both with us
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.120]  sorry to get you on late I was stuck with Uncle Ted
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.120]  you want to start with
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.120]  Kaya Jones we start with Joy
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.120]  who wants to go first here
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:28.120]  either way
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:30.120]  yeah I'll go first
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:32.120]  you were always preaching the truth
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.120]  you were always holding it down
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:36.120]  for the true Americans and the conservatives out there
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:38.120]  we need a voice and you're our voice so thank you Alex
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.120]  well we're in this together and listen
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:42.120]  I mean it's not only do I like you
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.120]  and like your music and like what you say if I disagreed with you
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  I'd be saying you shouldn't be banned
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.120]  or demonetized this is real discrimination
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.120]  yeah I mean it's crazy
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.120]  that it happened to us when it happened we were
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.120]  absolutely shocked and
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:58.120]  I wasn't gonna go public with it but when it happened
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.120]  to Kaya I said we have to do something
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.120]  about it so we took the social
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.120]  media only
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.120]  only because we took the social media
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.120]  did YouTube back
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.120]  now Miss Jones the same thing basically
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.120]  happened to you what's your take on this
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  yeah mine were my views
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:18.120]  my views were going from
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.120]  you know over 62,000
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.120]  in a couple days by
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.120]  the next morning it had dropped to
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:26.120]  53 so it was
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.120]  a population of actual
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:30.120]  algorithms of the and you can't take
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:32.120]  plays away versus followers
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.120]  and things like that so
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.120]  very odd very strange and
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.120]  so me and Joy we took to social media
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.120]  and my views have been released
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.120]  and they're going back up but yeah there's
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.120]  there's a lot of censorship that goes on with
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:46.120]  the web we know that they're
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  you know run by these big
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.120]  big powers that be they have their own
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:52.120]  narrative that they want to push and control
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:54.120]  well the good news is
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:56.120]  you ladies both have got millions
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.120]  of followers and listeners you've only got
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.120]  bigger standing in the face of censorship
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:02.120]  and I know you want to shift gears with something
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:04.120]  really positive now boy
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.120]  how they exacerbated the tragic
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:08.120]  events in Charlottesville
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:10.120]  Virginia but three weeks later
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:12.120]  it blew up in their face in the tragedy
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:14.120]  Harvey how that
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:16.120]  you just feel the energy level go from negative
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.120]  to positive how the polls
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.120]  shifted in the last week
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:22.120]  oh yeah oh yeah and they
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:24.120]  they tried their hardest to say that America's
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:26.120]  races and
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.120]  you know there's white supremacy everywhere
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.120]  and then you see these so-called white supremacists
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.120]  helping each other
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.120]  with the hurricane Harvey relief and that's
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.120]  what we saw when we were in Texas we saw all
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.120]  different colors helping
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.120]  each other joining together
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.120]  and we're happy to announce
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.120]  we with our social media campaign
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.120]  and being there we've raised two million
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:48.120]  dollars with mercury
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.120]  one.org
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.120]  we should have come out minute one
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.120]  because it started with that NFL player raising
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.120]  a few million then he raised like 40 something million
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.120]  you have raised two million dollars tell folks
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:00.120]  we should have started this out that deal
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:02.120]  censored YouTubers
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.120]  censored Patriot not even conservative
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.120]  just censored Patriot
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.120]  YouTubers raised two million for hurricane victims
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.120]  well I mean
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:12.120]  right yeah
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:14.120]  and when we use our platform
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.120]  you know Kai and I said listen this is important
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:18.120]  to us not a lot of celebrities are coming out
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.120]  it was
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.120]  a week ago when it
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:24.120]  started and nobody else was coming out
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.120]  at that time and so we thought this is
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:28.120]  important and so the first 24 hours
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:30.120]  we actually raised two hundred thousand
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.120]  dollars and then it just started snowballing
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:34.120]  from there so we just ask everyone if they can give
[01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:36.120]  to mercury one.org it's a great organization
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:38.120]  100% of the proceeds
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.120]  actually go to helping the hurricane victims
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.120]  unlike Red Cross which donates
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.120]  10% and we were actually there
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:46.120]  on the ground in Houston
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.120]  and they're authentic this is
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.120]  this is the real deal they're feeding people
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.120]  clothing people we delivered
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:54.120]  baby supplies to people who needed
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:56.120]  it's worse than the news
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:58.120]  is saying it's really bad out there
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.120]  and it's only going to get worse unless people donate
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.120]  and that's why we're really really asking
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.120]  and we're so grateful to our followers
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  and fans who have come together
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:08.120]  and helped us and jumped on the train
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:10.120]  of unity.
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:12.120]  Talk about how bad it is this disaster is
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.120]  ongoing.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.120]  Yeah Kaya was there an extra day.
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.120]  Well that's the thing
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:20.120]  that if we weren't censored and it was
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.120]  actual proper
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.120]  analytics on what
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.120]  you know are allowing independent artists
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.120]  to have their traction and
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:30.120]  conservative independent artists how much
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:32.120]  more money could we have raised
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.120]  because I mean we did this while censorship was going
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  on so I mean
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:38.120]  it was beautiful and we were able to
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.120]  physically help we
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.120]  did a lot of periscopes when we were down there but
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:44.120]  we were able to hand out you know gift cards
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.120]  money
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.120]  we cooked we you know
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.120]  with all the different sets that
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:52.120]  Operation BBQ
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.120]  Relief they're amazing
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.120]  and we were feeding the police
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.120]  and the military who hadn't eaten
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.120]  hot meals since Sunday
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:02.120]  yeah that's right and that's Rubicon
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:04.120]  right there the video showing
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:06.120]  Team Rubicon that's actually the mucking out
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:08.120]  that's when we had
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:10.120]  we went out and helped these guys actually get
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:12.120]  all the stuff out of people's homes
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.120]  now how bad is it it smells
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:16.120]  like death out there there is sewage
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:18.120]  in the water there's bodies in the water
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:20.120]  the death tolls going up there
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.120]  the smell the suffocation

[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:26.120]  so we had to get everything out of those
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:28.120]  homes because the mold is getting so
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:30.120]  bad that it can actually kill

[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.120]  millions and millions of people
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:30.120]  following millions of song downloads
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.120]  and they've got the courage
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:34.120]  to be
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.120]  supporting Trump
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:38.120]  in the face of the massive bullying
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:40.120]  and most men I know
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:42.120]  even if they like to
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:44.120]  be supporting Trump
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.120]  in the face of the massive bullying
[01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:48.120]  and most men I know
[01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.120]  even if they like to stock market being up
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:52.120]  and jobs coming back
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:54.120]  in America actually running our own
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.120]  affairs they're scared
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.120]  they want to play both sides
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.120]  and basically be lukewarm
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:02.120]  that's what's gotten us to this point
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.120]  the left is bullying everybody
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:06.120]  they're not the left
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:08.120]  they're trying to create a cult here
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.120]  I used to go after Bush
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:12.120]  I used to be a complete independent
[01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.120]  I still am, I hate the Republican leadership
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:16.120]  of the rhinos
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:18.120]  that are trying to block Trump
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:20.120]  but when you see somebody
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.120]  under such attack like Trump
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:24.120]  how do you not get behind him
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:26.120]  when he's willing to sit there
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.120]  and weather this attack
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.120]  you guys want to make comments to that
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:32.120]  Ms. Jones or Ms. Vila
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.120]  yeah it's so true
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.120]  no go ahead you want to go ahead Joy
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:38.120]  sure Kaya because I know we both know the same thing
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.120]  is no other president in history
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:42.120]  has gotten so much hate
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.120]  but has done so much good
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.120]  and all he simply does is wants to make
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:48.120]  America great again
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.120]  and we see so much backlash
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:52.120]  from people who just don't understand
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:54.120]  that American values need to be preserved
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.120]  conservative values need to be preserved
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.120]  we need to have family first, America first
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.120]  we need to make sure we're
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.120]  one nation under God
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.120]  unification and we're tolerant of everybody else
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.120]  they're telling us we can't be traditionalist
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.120]  if we want to
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:10.120]  and I want to expand on that
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:12.120]  you talk about delivering, even his enemies go
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:14.120]  he does say what he means
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.120]  and he really is delivering on a lot of his promises
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:18.120]  and they're so upset about that
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:20.120]  because they can't deny it
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.120]  when they see the stock market is up
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:24.120]  jobs are in
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.120]  talking to those hurricane Harvey victims
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:28.120]  I wore my make America great again hat
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.120]  and people walked up to me
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:32.120]  and talked to me and said thank you for wearing that hat
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.120]  we love our president
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.120]  we're so glad he visited us twice
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  they love their president down there
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.120]  and they're in the middle of trying to save their own lives
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:42.120]  and yet they still love their president
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.120]  they have hope for America
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.120]  they have people in America who have everything
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.120]  head to them on a platter and they are complaining
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:50.120]  Kyle where are we right now in America
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:52.120]  this epic battle going on
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:54.120]  would you say the forces of liberty are winning
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:56.120]  or at a stalemate or losing
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:58.120]  no we're in a scary time
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:00.120]  in America I think it's imperative
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:02.120]  that everyone starts speaking out and being
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:04.120]  proud of what their narrative is
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.120]  especially if they support the president
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.120]  and they support our military

[01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.120]  we need to swing the pendulum
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.120]  the problem is that there's such
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:20.120]  negative every day

[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:24.120]  you're putting out so much negative
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  the weather's been nuts everything's
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.120]  just so intense and it's all

[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.120]  for years
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.120]  until
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.120]  these guys looked at sanitarium
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.120]  they picked it up down here
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:56.120]  they would run it on channel 8
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:58.120]  pbs every once in a great while
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.120]  I was like oh my god
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.120]  I'm not the only one
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.120]  there's other people

[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.120]  people together who are working in unifying
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.120]  and what's your name

[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:28.120]  you guys are too nice
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:30.120]  that's a joy vila
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:32.120]  and kaya jones is with us as well
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.120]  you know from 99%
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:36.120]  of people with rebel flags
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:38.120]  which is just a battle flag
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:40.120]  it is a thing we got our ass kicked
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:42.120]  and all this happened in great great granddaddy was in it
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:44.120]  and it was all about a war about resources
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:46.120]  and we just have it because we're being rebellious
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.120]  it is a very small minority
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:50.120]  it's about racism and you can take any symbol and claim
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.120]  it's connected to racism
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:54.120]  but in my experience and seeing all the footage of folks
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:56.120]  with their rebel flags out
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:58.120]  saving black people white people you name it
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.120]  if they were races before
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.120]  which I don't think most of them are
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:04.120]  coming together like this just neutralizes it
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.120]  joy this is beautiful what we saw
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:08.120]  oh yeah isn't that beautiful
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.120]  and that's why I wanted to put that out
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.120]  I've got tons of footage of unity
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:14.120]  kaya and I we did video
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.120]  we did facebook and this is why we went out there
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:18.120]  not only to raise money for hurricane victims
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  but also to show
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.120]  that they are struggling out there
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.120]  and yet they are unified
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.120]  more than americans who are
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.120]  they have everything some of these people
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.120]  and they're complaining about what they have
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:32.120]  and those guys they're pro america
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:34.120]  they love you alex they love our president
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.120]  they were so happy to see us
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:38.120]  we were able to gift that family
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:40.120]  a thousand dollars worth of gift cards
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.120]  give them food give them clothing
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.120]  and help a lot more families like that
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.120]  and I just got to say a shout out
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:48.120]  I'm not paid to do this but I do have brain force with me
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.120]  and this stopped me through the stress
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:52.120]  and suffering seeing that out there
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:54.120]  and you just want to do so much more
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:56.120]  you guys still look great out there
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:58.120]  in the middle of that stinking swamp
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.120]  God is good
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:02.120]  yeah it was incredible
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:04.120]  there was so much unity out there
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:06.120]  didn't you just see so many people coming together kaya?
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.120]  oh no it was incredible
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.120]  I mean it was non stop
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:12.120]  like they were victors
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:14.120]  even though they are victims of this disaster
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:16.120]  and that's another point
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:18.120]  why would you two
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.120]  not censoring you now so you don't want to rub it in
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.120]  but why would they censor these
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.120]  loving unification videos
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.120]  because they know that's the power
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:28.120]  every time I put out the nicest
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:30.120]  unity video that goes viral
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.120]  that's what they ban
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.120]  well they're not going to ban that video
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:36.120]  because they back down and we made sure they back down
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:38.120]  and we're grateful that they did
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:40.120]  because we use YouTube
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  and that's the thing if you're an independent artist
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.120]  and you're getting suppressed by certain
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.120]  companies like Facebook
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:48.120]  Twitter, Instagram, YouTube
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.120]  you want to make sure that
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.120]  you fight it but also you realize
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:54.120]  you need this to be able to get the word
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  out no I agree and we kind of jump between
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  the platforms as they censor
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.120]  we don't want to make them enemies
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:02.120]  we just want them to stop
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.120]  we just want to stop bullying us
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:06.120]  back off and now we're good
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:08.120]  we're friends again
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:10.120]  YouTube's been good to me now
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:12.120]  so they're going to stay in their corner
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:14.120]  I'll stay in mine and keep creating content
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:16.120]  well let me just say this
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  I'm going to tell you something
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.120]  I want to create a radio show
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:22.120]  and we've had the affiliates
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.120]  that is round table hosted
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:26.120]  by ladies like yourselves
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:28.120]  and I've been privately thinking about it
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.120]  I know you guys are busy as well as be like 5 or 6 hosts
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.120]  that way people don't have to work 5 days a week
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.120]  with all the other jobs you have
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.120]  but I would like to send you guys the equipment
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:38.120]  and set it up so that you guys can be contributors
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.120]  for info wars
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:42.120]  we would love to Alec
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.120]  come back if you can because I want to come back

[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:20.120]  Patrick Henry warned us
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.120]  the liberties of a people never were
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:24.120]  nor ever will be secure
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:26.120]  when the transactions of their rulers
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:28.120]  may be concealed from them

[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.120]  at every level is concealed from us
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:34.120]  we have trade deals to manage our economy
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:36.120]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.120]  later in life Patrick Henry looked back
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.120]  and said when the American spirit was in its youth
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:42.120]  the language of America was different
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:44.120]  liberty sir was the primary object
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:46.120]  today our primary concern
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:48.120]  is safety and comfort
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:50.120]  when we should be demanding liberty

[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:24.120]  since Trump got elected
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:26.120]  or right before
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:28.120]  she's been a guest many times
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:30.120]  she got censored wearing that dynamite
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:32.120]  dress there in Hollywood
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:34.120]  well she already had some hits
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:36.120]  along with Kaya Jones
[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  but she's gone to number one
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:40.120]  now after her YouTube channel
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.120]  was censored and blocked
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.120]  and demonetized two weeks ago
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:46.120]  Make America Great Again is now
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.120]  number one
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.120]  on amazon.com
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:52.120]  that's above all the other top groups
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:54.120]  that is an unprecedented victory
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.120]  number one 99
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:58.120]  cents ladies and gentlemen
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:00.120]  and I have no connection to it
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:02.120]  monetarily it just excites me
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:04.120]  to see that at number one
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:06.120]  and again we were talking about
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:08.120]  the Streisand
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:10.120]  effect
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:12.120]  what we're pushing culturally
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:14.120]  coming together not being racist
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:16.120]  judging folks by the content of what they do
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:18.120]  not what color they are
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:20.120]  I go to a restaurant because the food's good
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:22.120]  I don't care if they're Asian, black, white, mixed, Hispanic
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:24.120]  I go listen to music
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:26.120]  on the radio or in concert because I like the music
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:28.120]  I
[02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:30.120]  I'm a married man but
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:32.120]  I look at the lady because she's beautiful wearing that dress
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:34.120]  because she is that's God's creation
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:36.120]  it doesn't matter to me what color her hair is
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.120]  what color her eyes are
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:40.120]  and that's what this comes down to
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:42.120]  ladies and gentlemen is that we are coming out of the hate
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:44.120]  we see them manipulating us
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:46.120]  we understand what's happening
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.120]  I want to talk about that
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:50.120]  bringing our next guest to co-host with us
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:52.120]  and then I also want to get into
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.120]  Trump handing out food
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.120]  working so hard with Melania
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:58.120]  trying to heal these fishers
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:00.120]  being loving and the media
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:02.120]  making jokes about it
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:04.120]  right now before we talk about the Fry's Hand effect
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:06.120]  let's go ahead and go to this clip
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.120]  this is what Trump actually did
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.120]  versus
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.120]  we have the Morning Joe
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:14.120]  making fun of him
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.120]  Hoots with laughter
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.120]  watching Trump load a truck
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.120]  why weren't you down there, here it is
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:22.120]  hey can you handle this

[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:36.120]  alright
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.120]  you got it
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:40.120]  yes sir
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:42.120]  one more
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.120]  loading it up
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:48.120]  one more
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:50.120]  here you go
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:56.120]  okay fellas
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:58.120]  you're all set
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:00.120]  thank you
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:02.120]  now that's what Trump actually did
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.120]  let's play
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:06.120]  the Morning Joe
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:08.120]  because understand
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:10.120]  just the president going
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:12.120]  and handing out food
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:14.120]  and going down there twice
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:16.120]  and shaking everybody's hands and hugging folks
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:18.120]  raises their spirits
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:20.120]  not something the globalist Obama
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:22.120]  or even Bush did
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:24.120]  and it gets everybody else to give money
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:26.120]  and Houston metros 10 million people
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:28.120]  and it's bad there's dead body
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:30.120]  sewage everywhere they're in crisis
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.120]  and they need continued support
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.120]  so Trump's keeping them in the news
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:36.120]  getting
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:38.120]  billions of dollars donated he himself
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:40.120]  gave a million and they made fun of it
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:42.120]  hey Scarborough how about you give something
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:44.120]  at least Leonardo DiCaprio gave a million
[02:11:44.120 --> 02:11:46.120]  I mean how dare you
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:48.120]  sit there and run your mouth so here's
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:50.120]  just Scarborough making
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:52.120]  a big joke out of all this
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:54.120]  you talk about sick here it is
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:58.120]  my hands are too big
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.120]  yeah for like a nine year old
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:04.120]  but anyway Willie did you see the
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:06.120]  the president's getting involved in relief efforts
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:08.120]  it's heartening to me
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:10.120]  and you can tell that he's done this
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:12.120]  I don't know if he did it with America
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.120]  I don't know if he's a Red Cross guy
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:16.120]  but here he is helping out that's great
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.120]  and then do we have the picture
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:20.120]  that's all you got you don't have the one
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.120]  of him what about the family when they came
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:24.120]  down you don't have
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:26.120]  the guy
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:28.120]  Willie so let's explain
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:30.120]  that they didn't get the one where
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.120]  the first thing he did he actually
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:34.120]  put in the cap
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:36.120]  well that was obviously a photo op
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:38.120]  for the president did a nice job going down there
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.120]  twice let's give him credit for going down there
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:42.120]  he was humanizing it
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.120]  I think we have the video somewhere put the bucket
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:46.120]  in the back of a pickup
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:48.120]  put this in the pickup so where do you put that
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.120]  you just right back
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:52.120]  in the cap
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:54.120]  what does it have to do with anything
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:56.120]  we'll show the video eventually
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:58.120]  he hands it in the front window
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:00.120]  yeah good thank you
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:02.120]  it's better when you see it
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:04.120]  wait you have to just take it because the president's putting it
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:06.120]  leave them on screen
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.120]  you want to know the enemy of humanity
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.120]  the elitist scum
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:12.120]  treating
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:14.120]  you like you're an idiot acting like we're in junior high
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:16.120]  and trumps not the cool kid
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:18.120]  and they're all the cool kids at the cool table
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.120]  making fun of the nerd
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:22.120]  kids at their nerd table
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.120]  I mean this is everything I hated
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:26.120]  in high school everything I hated
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.120]  in junior high
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:30.120]  these are the people's asses I kicked
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:32.120]  they were beating up little nerds and stuff
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:34.120]  these people are so
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:36.120]  sick
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.120]  making fun of Trump
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:40.120]  walks up the guy puts his hands out
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:42.120]  he's humanizing it
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:44.120]  how dare you put it in the front of the truck
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.120]  how does Trump know it's raining outside
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.120]  oh you should have put it in the back
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.120]  oh you're an idiot you're the man in the arena
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:52.120]  pull up Teddy Roosevelt's man in the arena please
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:54.120]  you're the man in the arena
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:56.120]  he's actually out there doing something
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:58.120]  you're sitting there in New York and NBC
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:00.120]  with the daughter of one of the biggest mass murderers
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:02.120]  in world history
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:04.120]  who bragged
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:06.120]  back to Khmer Rouge murdering millions
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:08.120]  all the other crap he did
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:10.120]  you sit up there
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:12.120]  with the dead intern in your office
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.120]  and all the rest of the crud you're engaged in
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:16.120]  and then you sit there
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.120]  and act like Trump's bad
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:20.120]  when he genuinely cares and is down there for real
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.120]  and he was during the campaign
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.120]  Hillary wouldn't even show up in the hurricanes
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:26.120]  she was too busy getting
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:28.120]  money from rich donors
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.120]  too busy stealing Haitian relief money
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:32.120]  to go to Haiti when we had our airplanes down there
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  exposing the UN sex crimes
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:36.120]  that Hillary and her staff were caught
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:38.120]  running
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  and so the media then
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.120]  turns it all into pizza gate diversions
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:44.120]  the man in the arena
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:46.120]  excerpt from a speech
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:48.120]  Citizenship in the Republic
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  delivered at the Tsar born in Paris, France
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:52.120]  the 23rd of April 1910
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:54.120]  it is not the critic who counts
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:56.120]  not the man who points out
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.120]  how the strongman stumbles
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.120]  or where the doer of deeds could have done better
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:02.120]  credit belongs
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:04.120]  the man in the arena
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:06.120]  who's actually in the arena
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.120]  who's faces marred by the dust and the sweat and the blood
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:10.120]  who strives valiantly who errs
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:12.120]  who comes short again and again
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:14.120]  because there is no effort
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.120]  without error and shortcoming
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:18.120]  but who does actually strive to do the deeds
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.120]  who knows the great enthusiasm
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:22.120]  the great devotions
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:24.120]  who spins himself in a worthy cause
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:26.120]  who at the best
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:28.120]  knows in the end
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:30.120]  the triumph of high achievement
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:32.120]  and who at the worst if he fails
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:34.120]  at least fails
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:36.120]  while daring greatly
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:38.120]  so that his place shall never be
[02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:40.120]  with those cold and timid souls
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:42.120]  who neither know
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:44.120]  victory nor defeat
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:46.120]  now let's go to women who know real victory
[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:48.120]  real action they raised
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:50.120]  two plus million dollars last week
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:52.120]  they have absolutely gone
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.120]  and they're covered what's happening
[02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:56.120]  brought hope to people
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:58.120]  and we're bringing in
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:00.120]  as well with us
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:02.120]  Candace Owens
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:04.120]  who has videos on average
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:06.120]  300, 400, 500,000 views
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:08.120]  some with millions just roars on to the scene
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:10.120]  got targeted in a race war
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:12.120]  false flag by the democrats
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:14.120]  by the deep state in a shut up
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:16.120]  where they run most these racist bots
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:18.120]  she caught them red handed
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:20.120]  so it's blown up in her face
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:22.120]  blown up in their face and then
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:24.120]  success is blown up in her face
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:26.120]  she censored her the day after
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.120]  she's on with me and Paul Watson
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:30.120]  but then she spoke out so then that blew up
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:32.120]  in their face so this is an amazing
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:34.120]  time to be alive before we go
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:36.120]  to Candace and all you guys
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:38.120]  can ride the rest of the hour if you can
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:40.120]  before we go back to Candace
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:42.120]  she was here with us last week before she got censored
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:44.120]  Kaia Jones and Joy Vila both
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.120]  great artist
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:48.120]  your songs number one
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.120]  Make America Great so you buck the system
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:52.120]  and your number one
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.120]  you had the talent but no guts no glory
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.120]  took you right to the top
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:58.120]  eye of the tiger comes to mind
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:17:00.120]  what is it like to see them
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:02.120]  making fun of the man in the arena
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:04.120]  to see Joe Scarborough and all those other hosts
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:06.120]  just absolutely are an embarrassment
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:08.120]  to humanity
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:10.120]  you know I look at Mika's face
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:12.120]  and like you said this is everything you hated
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:14.120]  about high school right the popular kids
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:16.120]  what happened to those popular kids
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:18.120]  after everybody graduated
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:20.120]  they became the drunks
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:22.120]  the losers the dead beats
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:24.120]  and it's the nerds and the ones
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:26.120]  everyone ignored who rose
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:28.120]  to the top because they're smarter
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:30.120]  and better than everyone else and
[02:17:30.120 --> 02:17:32.120]  look at her face she's so
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:34.120]  disgusted but that's all she has she has
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:36.120]  one face disgust
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:38.120]  she can't think for herself she's listening to what
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:40.120]  Joe says he can't think for himself
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:42.120]  they're both just a putrid bowl
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.120]  of regurgitating the same story
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:46.120]  and the fact that they're politicizing this drama
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.120]  to make it their own drama
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:50.120]  and taking away from what the president is doing
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:52.120]  to save the lives of those people
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:54.120]  we looked in the faces of those people down there
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.120]  they are suffering they are dying
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:58.120]  they need all the help they can get in the fact
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:00.120]  exactly how do you make a joke when you're not
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:02.120]  down there and the president's down there
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:04.120]  trying to do something belittling the effort
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:06.120]  what the hell this is so
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:08.120]  entitled you talk about the
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:10.120]  problem being rich white men I'm starting to
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:12.120]  agree it's Joe Scarborough the disconnected
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.120]  blue blood piece of crap
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:16.120]  he's definitely disconnected
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.120]  and nobody in America
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:20.120]  is gonna side with that guy
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:22.120]  because nobody is as heartless as that guy
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:24.120]  does that not show how desperate they are Kaya
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:26.120]  Candace does that not show desperation
[02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:28.120]  absolutely it's still
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:30.120]  a lot of hatred
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:32.120]  I mean they didn't win
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.120]  yeah Candace jump in first and we'll go to Kaya
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:36.120]  I'm sorry I'm not traffic gobbling well
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:38.120]  Candace what do you
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:40.120]  make of this it's
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:42.120]  beneath them it shows a lot of hatred
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:44.120]  and again it just
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:46.120]  shows that their hell bent on
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:48.120]  making Trump out to be an enemy it shows that
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.120]  he can literally do no right
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:52.120]  and I think it's largely embarrassing for them
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:54.120]  it's embarrassing for the people that they support
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:56.120]  and it shows why Trump won because
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:58.120]  they're no they're acting like children
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:00.120]  on air they're no longer even
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.120]  commentating politically they're just there to make
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:04.120]  fun of him every single day and people are exhausted
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:06.120]  with it
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.120]  don't they get that everybody roots for
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:10.120]  the underdog even if Trump wasn't as good as he
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:12.120]  is people would still root for him he's doing a
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.120]  lot of great work but the way they pile
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:16.120]  on him and his family and on those
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:18.120]  of you that all of you have been persecuted
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:20.120]  just because you want to make America great
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:22.120]  again that's right
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:24.120]  that's right and they're not
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:26.120]  going to stop I think it's going to get worse before
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:28.120]  it gets better but that doesn't mean we're
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.120]  not going to get better that's the thing
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:32.120]  the more they push us the more they attack
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.120]  us the better we must become we're 10
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:36.120]  times stronger than them 10 times smarter
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:38.120]  than them and I'm telling you Trump is going to win
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:40.120]  in a landslide 2020
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:42.120]  because of his nonsense
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:44.120]  oh yeah that's right I know
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:46.120]  that Joy Vila and of course
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:48.120]  Kaia Jones up to go here about 5 minutes I'm going to come
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:50.120]  back and spend the rest of this important
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:52.120]  hour with Candace Owens
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:54.120]  who also got censored but they had to back off
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:56.120]  with a blip in their face but going back
[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:58.120]  to Kaia and then of course
[02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:00.120]  to Joy Vila closing comments
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:02.120]  about what you've witnessed the last few weeks
[02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.120]  just
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.120]  a magnitude of connection
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:08.120]  the human spirit and the
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:10.120]  American spirit coming together I mean we saw
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:12.120]  American flags everywhere
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:14.120]  each one of these homes that has been
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:16.120]  completely flooded
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:18.120]  had to be gutted they lost everything
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:20.120]  there was the American flag
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:22.120]  literally
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:24.120]  propped up with all of the things
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:26.120]  that were now you know the
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:28.120]  gutting of the home the interior
[02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:30.120]  of the home now outside so to me that says
[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:32.120]  volumes of we are
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:34.120]  united not divided no matter
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:36.120]  whether it's a hurricane or
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.120]  propaganda or pushing narratives
[02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:40.120]  that don't exist and
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:42.120]  what you know what MSN
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:44.120]  needs to realize is that when they keep pushing
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:46.120]  this
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.120]  rhetoric and hurtful comments about
[02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:50.120]  our president they're actually talking about the people
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:52.120]  that voted him in and
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:54.120]  we're taking it personally it's getting to a point
[02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:56.120]  where I just don't know how much more
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:58.120]  they think they're going to be able to push
[02:20:58.120 --> 02:21:00.120]  push us against the wall before we eventually
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:02.120]  just punch back
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.120]  Wow
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:06.120]  Joy?
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:08.120]  I have to tell you you know the pain and suffering
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:10.120]  and I echo what Kaya said
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:12.120]  and what we've seen the pain and suffering down
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:14.120]  there is so real and so raw
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:16.120]  the smells
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:18.120]  the bodies the way it's happening
[02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:20.120]  people haven't had food for weeks some of them
[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.120]  it's their first hot meal and we got to deliver it
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:24.120]  to them they don't have baby supplies
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:26.120]  they don't I mean the babies have been taken out
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:28.120]  of the water you know almost dying
[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:30.120]  I mean this is an emergency
[02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:32.120]  situation and
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:34.120]  for Americans to use this to politicize
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:36.120]  for bad Americans for the
[02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.120]  media to make it seem like we're all racist
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:40.120]  and this is this is the white supremacy
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:42.120]  and the president's not doing anything is a
[02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:44.120]  Travis you know what you think of Charlie Hebdo
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:46.120]  who has the right to do it I'm not saying blow him up
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.120]  but saying that like
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.120]  Houston's a bunch of white supremacists so thank God
[02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:52.120]  and professors and CNN
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:54.120]  CNN New York Times said this is
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:56.120]  God's vengeance on
[02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:58.120]  conservatives when the city's the most
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:00.120]  diverse in the country it's the most
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:02.120]  disgusting thing I've seen it's
[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:04.120]  absolutely evil it's decrepit
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:06.120]  and the way we fight that is by showing
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:08.120]  more support and more love if you can go
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:10.120]  out to Houston if you can volunteer if you can
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:12.120]  donate we're working with mercury1.org
[02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:14.120]  these people will take everything they can
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:16.120]  they need your help and we have to continue
[02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:18.120]  the message fight the mass media
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:20.120]  fight this negativity with love
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:22.120]  compassion unity and support for our president
[02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:24.120]  and for one another that's right
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:26.120]  Kyah Jones I want to get some comments and joy on
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:28.120]  this and then and we're going to the rest of the hour
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:30.120]  and it's a Oh and here censor
[02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:32.120]  but you know come back like the phoenix
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:34.120]  where did the where do you
[02:22:34.120 --> 02:22:36.120]  think this goes next as as joy was saying
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:38.120]  the nastiness just
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.120]  I mean I'll go out on the street people most folks
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:42.120]  like me or my listeners very race
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.120]  creed all human
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:46.120]  but I the left comes over and physically
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:48.120]  attacks me now they scream not to get me
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.120]  it's all made up I mean
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:52.120]  joy saying it's going to get worse
[02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:54.120]  do you agree with that and how bad will it get
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.120]  I think it's important for us
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:58.040]  to do what we can.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:00.400]  Like, if we constantly, you know, me and Joy
[02:23:00.400 --> 02:23:02.820]  were in the middle of, you know, my song was number three,
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:04.600]  her song was number one.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:06.840]  So at the same time, right this week,
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:10.040]  and we literally pulled promoting our records
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:12.520]  in this moment to go and volunteer.
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:15.840]  So for me, it's like, I don't understand the excuses
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:17.840]  or why Beyonce's not down there,
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:19.920]  or why a heck of a lot more artists
[02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:22.600]  aren't bringing their awareness to the cause.
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:25.880]  If everybody is just kind of on this negative,
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:28.320]  negative, negative approach, I think that we're doomed
[02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:29.800]  if we do not fix it.
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:34.040]  So going down there, giving back, doing a good deed,
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:36.560]  you know, energetically might be the right move
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:38.360]  that we just kind of go, you know,
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:41.360]  what did she say, Michelle Obama?
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:42.800]  Oh, when they go low, we go high.
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.320]  We're soaring high.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:46.840]  We're not even like on the next level as them.
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:49.000]  It's so ridiculous how low they've gone.
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.200]  Well, Kaya Jones, you're on fire
[02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:55.200]  because my next two questions were exactly that.
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:56.600]  I notice you guys didn't even come on
[02:23:56.600 --> 02:23:57.480]  and talk about your records,
[02:23:57.480 --> 02:24:01.480]  despite yours being number three, Joy's being number one.
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:03.440]  You guys never even made it about that,
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.400]  but we should celebrate the fact
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:08.720]  that despite all the intimidation, all the censorship
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:10.800]  that you guys have only been more successful,
[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:14.160]  despite all the other cowardly people in music
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:16.480]  and in Hollywood, almost none of them
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:18.400]  would even dare give to Texas,
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.520]  other than Leonardo DiCaprio, to his credit,
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:23.240]  because they're too afraid to look like they're aligned
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.520]  with the evil white supremacist Texans.
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:28.200]  Well, that's not exactly, and that's the thing too,
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:30.760]  is no matter what happens, it's like we say,
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:33.040]  it's gonna get worse out there in the media,
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:34.800]  but people are gonna start turning off,
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:36.760]  tuning out and tuning into info wars,
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:38.800]  tuning into alternative media,
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:41.760]  because we're providing hope, we're providing truth,
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:43.240]  we're providing, you know, we're saying,
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.600]  make America great again, that's what my song sings about.
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:49.120]  You can be the, we can be the hope of every hungry child.
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:50.520]  That's what I sing in my song.
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:52.680]  Kaia's song, What the Heart Don't Know,
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:56.800]  is about the army, army spouse losing her husband
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:24:58.200]  because he goes off to war.
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:00.040]  I mean, we're singing pro-America music
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:02.320]  and we're inspiring people to do better and be better
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:03.160]  because we can't get involved.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:04.320]  Let's explain, you guys have the number one,
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:06.560]  number three songs right now in the country,
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:09.560]  and where is the hype and celebration in MSM of you?
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:12.040]  It's nowhere because you're not controlled
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:13.360]  by the big corporate chiefs,
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:15.800]  you're controlled by your heart and your mind.
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:16.880]  Well, and you know what it is?
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:18.880]  It's because we can curate the minds
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:20.320]  that they want to curate.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:22.120]  It's because you're running your own brain,
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:23.720]  you're running your own show ladies.
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:24.560]  That's right, that's right.
[02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:25.480]  Here's the big powerful women
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:27.240]  that are independent everybody's looking for
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:28.840]  and they're in any coverage of you guys
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.320]  other than the independent media.
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:33.760]  And despite the fake media ignoring you, your number one.
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:35.280]  That's right, they can't stop us.
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:37.760]  That's the beautiful thing, Alex, they cannot stop us.
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:39.880]  They can say what they want, they can troll,
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:41.360]  they can cry, they can whine,
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.960]  they can insult our president,
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:44.200]  they can insult our veterans,
[02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:45.600]  they can insult our Texans,
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:48.040]  but they will not stop us and we will prevail
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:49.840]  because we're strong and we're using strong.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:51.520]  Wow, it's amazing.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.240]  Okay, we're gonna go to break it in this.
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:55.560]  I know you ladies are going on to your next interview.
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:56.400]  I guess you're in Dallas,
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:00.160]  you've gotten a day or so away from the flooding,
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:03.560]  but kiajones and kiajones.com, Joy Vila on Twitter
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:05.080]  at Joy underscore Vila.
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:08.640]  Other parts, other tidbits you'd like to impart to people.
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:12.120]  Just stay strong, Texas.
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:14.400]  I think Texas right now should be the priority
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:18.200]  of the nation to get behind and to support.
[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:19.280]  They're the heart of America
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:21.160]  and it needs to be supported right now.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.080]  They need food, they need clothing,
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:25.200]  they've lost their furniture, they've lost their home.
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.200]  And meanwhile, you're wanting to spew rhetoric
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:29.840]  about our commander in chief.
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:31.560]  By the way, he is our commander in chief
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:32.680]  and if he's not your president,
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:34.120]  then you're not a United States citizen
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:35.160]  and you need to get out.
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:37.080]  That's my opinion.
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:38.560]  Exactly, and I want to say too,
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:39.880]  is I want to remind everyone,
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:41.640]  like I do on my Periscopes, my YouTube,
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:44.040]  you are a spiritual being, you're not your circumstance,
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:46.760]  you're not your body, you're not what people tell you you are.
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:49.600]  You can affect change, God has blessed you with gifts.
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.960]  If you're crying over Texas, get off your ass,
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:54.040]  get out there, donate, help.
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:55.440]  You don't have to sit there and be sad,
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:57.600]  turn off the news and do something about it
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:26:59.840]  because you can, you're gifted with that power
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.720]  and I know that America can come back twice as strong
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.200]  and we're doing it right now.
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:06.520]  Well, I'll tell you, the Lord works in mysterious ways
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:09.000]  and it's just amazing.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:10.480]  Candace, we're gonna talk about the censorship
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:12.160]  you've gone through and all the other big stories
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:14.000]  when we come back, but what is it like
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.840]  for you to see every time they attack,
[02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:18.480]  as long as we stand back up, we just get stronger?
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:21.640]  We've been hearing these amazing ladies break it down.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.000]  It's just an incredible time to be alive in history.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.240]  What's your takeaway here?
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:28.320]  Absolutely, I don't think we're ever going to see
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:30.720]  anything like this for the rest of our lifetime.
[02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:33.120]  It is incredible, incredible time to be an American.
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:35.200]  It's incredible to see us standing up
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:38.320]  and fighting the vicious media and the lies
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.440]  and it's collapsing from underneath them
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:43.200]  and guess what, I think they absolutely know
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:45.120]  that their days are numbered.
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:46.400]  You don't think Micah and Jo know
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:47.360]  that their days are numbered.
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:50.440]  No one's buying the poison that they're selling.
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:53.160]  And it's embarrassing, it's embarrassing to watch them
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:54.000]  time and time again.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.600]  I don't know how they do it with a straight face
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:58.480]  half the time, but I'm tremendously proud
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:02.040]  to be an American and I'm tremendously proud
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:04.600]  that we are creating this ecosystem
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.880]  that was once underground and is kind of raising up
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:10.520]  at this time and I'm unapologetically happy
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:13.120]  about all of that, so it's great to watch.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.760]  Incredible, I mean, that's it.
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:17.680]  We are, it's not that we're perfect,
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.920]  but we've had a poisonous group of dividers
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:21.600]  in control involved in pure evil,
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:23.160]  their own documents admitted,
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:25.400]  and now you look at Morning Joe in that video,
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:27.640]  they look so desperate and pathetic, Joy.
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:31.360]  They do, they're blind, they barely say what,
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:33.280]  they don't even know what they're trying to say.
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:34.280]  They're looking at the video,
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:36.200]  they couldn't pull up the video,
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:37.800]  he's trying to describe the video,
[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:40.480]  and they've lost the plot, they've completely lost the plot
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:43.100]  just like Candace said, they know they're on a sinking ship,
[02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:45.920]  they know they're dying, they're struggling,
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:47.800]  I'm sure all the advertisers are gonna start pulling
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:49.720]  their money and they're gonna start looking at us.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:51.120]  And by the way, you're so beautiful,
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:52.800]  your truth is so beautiful,
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:53.640]  you don't just look beautiful,
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:55.640]  your truth is so beautiful, there's nothing sexier,
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.360]  it's real, we're not just selling hype like they do,
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:01.080]  they are on a burning sinking ship, we're winning,
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:04.280]  if we just realize it, that's why they're so desperate.
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:05.120]  Oh yeah.
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:05.960]  That's right.
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:06.800]  No, he's a small deer.
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:07.640]  He's a small deer.
[02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:09.520]  Nobody's on small deer, Alex.
[02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:10.360]  Nobody.
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:11.440]  That's right, that's right.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:13.760]  They only go after us because we're the lions.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:14.600]  That's right.
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:15.440]  That's right.
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:16.960]  Well, ladies, please come back more often.
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:18.440]  We love you, all of you.
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.360]  Thank you, Ms. Jones, thank you, Ms. Vila.
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:22.520]  People need to follow you guys
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.280]  and keep the songs at number one forever,
[02:29:24.280 --> 02:29:26.080]  and thank you for all the work you did down there
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:26.920]  in Dangerous Houston.
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:28.520]  We're gonna come back to another great patriot
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:30.880]  in the fight of the Mayan Wars against the bullies,
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:34.440]  Candace Owens on YouTube, Red Pill Black on Twitter
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:35.600]  at Red Pill Black.
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:37.360]  I'm Alex Jones at Real Alex Jones.
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:38.920]  Stay with us, this is a war.
[02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:43.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.680 --> 02:29:54.880]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:56.520]  has now gone so mainstream
[02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:58.760]  that even realtor.com is writing about it.
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.520]  But the realtors are still embarrassed
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:03.240]  to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:05.400]  from what they call Uncle Travis's guns
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:08.000]  and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.800]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers,
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:13.960]  but the grasshoppers will still sing the tune
[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:15.000]  if they can make money.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.040]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.840]  where you can drop another million dollars
[02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:21.680]  to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:25.000]  There are still very effective low-tech, low-cost things
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:26.120]  you can do to prepare.
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:29.120]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:31.640]  and doing anything to act on that realization
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:33.880]  increases your chances of survival.
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:37.040]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario
[02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:38.560]  will help you to weather storms,
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:40.280]  to absorb an economic shock,
[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:42.400]  or to protect you from home invasion.
[02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:44.400]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:46.440]  while you educate yourself and others
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:48.400]  and work for the best-case scenario.
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:51.240]  Get more information at infowars.com.
[02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:52.880]  I'm David Knight.
[02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:54.760]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:56.760]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:30:56.760 --> 02:30:59.720]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:30:59.720 --> 02:31:02.560]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals
[02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:05.760]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:08.120]  The same team based right here in America
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:10.840]  that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:12.240]  Water Filtration Systems
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:14.960]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:16.320]  Whether it's your home or office,
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:18.480]  you owe it to yourself, your coworkers,
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:20.040]  your family, your children,
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.480]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:22.480 --> 02:31:25.160]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:27.600]  while themselves doing things that mitigate
[02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:30.520]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:32.680]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:36.560]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:39.240]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet
[02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:40.200]  incredibly clean.
[02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:41.960]  This is a system I'm personally putting in
[02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:42.800]  throughout my house,
[02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:44.880]  replacing older, more expensive filters
[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:46.880]  that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:49.880]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[02:31:49.880 --> 02:31:51.360]  and infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:55.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:57.880]  and put it together with our own four years
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:32:01.240]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:02.720]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.000]  to detoxify the body.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.040]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield.
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:08.920]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:10.320]  It's made in the USA.
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:13.120]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:15.920]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:17.200]  and it supports the info war.
[02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:19.320]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:22.160]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking
[02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:23.000]  for over a year.
[02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:26.160]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:29.040]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.920]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:36.600]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:38.560]  and as focused as you can be.
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:41.480]  Because we need you, the remnant of America,
[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:43.840]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:45.840]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:48.080]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:49.120]  we're changing the world.
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:50.720]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[02:32:50.720 --> 02:33:05.440]  with Z-Shield and ForwardsLive.com.
[02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:10.320]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:13.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:16.280]  All right.
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:20.560]  You know, I couldn't be drug away from this live show
[02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:22.520]  today.
[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:27.000]  I did take off yesterday, most of the day,
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.600]  and I went out to the lake with my family,
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:33.520]  and I was jumping off a 20-foot two-story dock
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.800]  and somehow pulled my back.
[02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:36.920]  So I've been here today.
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:38.200]  I've been on air.
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:39.000]  My back's pulled out.
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.680]  I'm not complaining, just if I sound a little bit different.
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:44.560]  It's because every 10 seconds or so,
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:46.320]  I get a big shooting pain in my spine.
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:49.880]  It feels like I'm looked into an electroshock system.
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:52.600]  The crew was just explaining this to me.
[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.280]  But wild horses couldn't drag me away
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.320]  because things are so exciting.
[02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:58.400]  The crew was just saying, hey, why don't you plug?
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.080]  You didn't plug last hour.
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:03.080]  And you plugged for like 30 seconds in the first hour.
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:05.440]  And we need money to hire more reporters and more crew
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:07.880]  and stave off the globalists and expand.
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:09.680]  So if you want to make a donation
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:12.480]  and get yourself great products is basically what it is.
[02:34:12.480 --> 02:34:14.000]  Towards the fight for the Republic,
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.400]  you can see where we've hit paydirt here.
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:19.360]  We're under a major enemy attack.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:20.800]  Number one, please pray for us.
[02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:23.680]  Believe me, that's the number one thing I want.
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:25.800]  Number two, please spread the articles and videos
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:28.040]  at newswars.com and infowars.com
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:29.520]  and all the great guests we have on.
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:32.240]  And number three, we've got the best supplements out there.
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:33.440]  Most of them are private labeled,
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:35.200]  best sellers already on the market.
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.680]  Then we just discount them 20% on average.
[02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:40.560]  When we do sales, we do it 50%.
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:43.360]  And Caveman is going to sell out in the next few weeks.
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:46.440]  More doesn't come in until October.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:48.600]  But I want you to try it.
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:50.000]  And folks that already tried it and love it
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:51.880]  and have given it 4.7 stars,
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:54.240]  thousands of reviews on third party sites.
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:57.280]  I want you to experience it for half off.
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:59.560]  Now it's always discounted off retail.
[02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:00.920]  So it's normally like $40.
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:02.880]  It's $30 right now.
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:04.440]  And it really, it's $29.
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.920]  It really is powerful.
[02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:07.880]  It's from chicken bones.
[02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:09.440]  Everybody knows you leave the breastbone in
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:11.400]  and cook it with somebody's got the flu or whatever.
[02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:12.240]  Well, this is beyond it.
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:15.920]  This is a whole bunch of concentrated organic systems
[02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:18.600]  with the chaga mushroom, with the turmeric,
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:21.640]  with the bee pollen and other super foods.
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:23.920]  And people are really taking advantage of this.
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.560]  I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:29.400]  And I'm discounting it to go after the demographic
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:31.680]  we know is waiting for something to be on super sale.
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:34.280]  And it's been working, working so good.
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:37.200]  We'll probably sell out of it in a week or something
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:38.280]  and then be sold out of it.
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:40.200]  But that's kind of a catch-22 because
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:44.080]  we're selling super male vitality concentrated herbs
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:47.160]  for Beto stamina energy for my own personal experiences,
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:49.480]  cold press for 57% off.
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:52.160]  With a 20% discount, we sell it all day.
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:54.160]  But I wanted to hit the demographic of folks
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:55.480]  that sit on the fence.
[02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:57.200]  We've never done this in the five years
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:35:58.520]  of the history of this product.
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.360]  We're doing it.
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:02.320]  And I thought it would take most of the month to sell out
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:05.520]  when we get more in October, late October.
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:07.200]  That's not the case.
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:09.040]  At this current rate, it's gonna sell out about a week.
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:10.720]  So I'm gonna have to end this soon.
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.720]  Super male vitality info or store.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:18.600]  X2 is 57% off as well.
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:20.400]  And there's a bunch of other products there.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:23.440]  So we've never done sales this deep on these products.
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:25.200]  And it's because you respond to sales.
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:26.240]  So we're doing it.
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:29.480]  Even though on some of these products, we make $5.
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:30.960]  When you sign up for auto ship,
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:33.080]  we lose money on some of these deals.
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.520]  This is an additional 10% off.
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:37.320]  But whatever you do, ask yourself in history.
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:39.760]  Is anybody fighting the global starter?
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:43.280]  Is anybody taking action in a more focused way?
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.720]  I hate to say it, but we are the best there is.
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:46.840]  We need your prayers.
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:48.080]  We need your support.
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:50.600]  We write the talking points of the opposition
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:51.800]  to the new world order.
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:54.280]  And believe me, we're humble about it.
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:56.760]  I thought about this last night.
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:57.600]  We're humble about it.
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:59.160]  So I think the audience fully understands
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:01.760]  we are the front line.
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:03.940]  And I don't say that from a power trip.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:08.720]  I got my little sword out staring down this thing.
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:10.060]  And we've had a lot of victories.
[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:10.900]  But let me tell you,
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:12.960]  they're really putting the heat on folks.
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:15.000]  They're putting the boots to me.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.220]  My family, myself, and I'm not complaining.
[02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:21.320]  I'm just telling you that the enemy knows we're on target.
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:25.160]  The information we cover here is crosshairs on.
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:26.860]  We are on target.
[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:28.160]  So please, we need your prayers.
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:29.480]  We need your financial support.
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.520]  M4store.com, M4slife.com.
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:36.440]  They've cut our funding 95% on YouTube.
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:37.920]  They've been banned in polls videos.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:40.380]  We're not, hey, we just want to get the word out.
[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:44.520]  But we were bringing in 50, 60, 70 grand a month.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:46.400]  Sounds like a lot when you got 70 employees.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:49.560]  It's not, now it's like 10 grand a month from YouTube.
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:53.360]  I mean, they banned us off Google ads six months ago.
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:56.200]  I mean, so they're chopping us off here
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:57.640]  as they try to take us down.
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:37:59.080]  That means take you down.
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:01.200]  But the good news is you've increased your support
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:03.720]  to us directly as this has happened.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:06.280]  So please, keep praying, keep spreading the articles
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:07.720]  and keep buying the products.
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:08.960]  These specials are about to end.
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:10.080]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:12.320]  Okay, she's been holding for 20, 30 minutes
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.880]  because I held the last guest over
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:15.400]  because I held Ted Nugent over.
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:18.200]  Kind of like a car wreck or traffic.
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.760]  It just backs up because everybody's so good.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.280]  So a lot of times I go into the fourth hour
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:25.000]  that Paul Watson's hosting because it's all just as good.
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.960]  It's not like I'm going over to the last guest
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:28.280]  because they're not as good as Ted Nugent
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:30.280]  or I'm going over Candice Owens
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.200]  because she's not as good as them.
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:32.760]  It's just that it's hard to hang up
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:34.120]  on these beautiful souls.
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:35.760]  So we're going to go to break it about 12 minutes.
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:36.600]  You've got the floor.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:39.360]  Let's talk about the censorship you went through,
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:41.120]  how you overcame it,
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:43.120]  but let's recap what we covered last week
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:46.200]  and the video they censored you did with Paul and I live,
[02:38:46.200 --> 02:38:51.200]  radio slash TV, when they set you up, the CIA, Gamergate,
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:55.400]  that how they go recruit men, women, minorities,
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:57.960]  you name it, with fake racism attacks.
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:38:59.920]  That's incredible testimony.
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:04.160]  So Candice Owens, thank you for joining us from Red Pill Black.
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.040]  Absolutely, I'm happy to be here.
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:06.880]  So let's start.
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:08.120]  I mean, where do you want to get the hurricane?
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:08.960]  What's happening?
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:10.920]  The censorship, how you struck back?
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:12.120]  How it all began?
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:15.240]  Let's start where it all began for you.
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:17.520]  All right, so for me, I was essentially,
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:20.040]  I always say that I was forced fed the Red Pill
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:23.360]  because I went and created a company
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:26.920]  and a woman named Zoe Quinn contacted me
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:28.480]  and told me that she was a woman
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:31.960]  that was attacked by anonymous white men on the internet.
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:36.960]  And that if I did not pull my company back and defund it,
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:40.360]  pull myself off of a fundraising platform
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:42.920]  that I was going to be attacked by anonymous white men.
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.160]  I didn't buy her story and I didn't pull myself
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.400]  off of Kickstarter and within hours,
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:51.360]  I was being attacked by what I was supposed to believe
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:53.120]  were Trump supporters.
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:57.240]  Everyone had this kind of handle pro-Trump John
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:00.400]  or pro-Trump Joe and they were saying,
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:02.120]  nigger, nigger, nigger, die, die, die.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:03.280]  And obviously I'm not a moron.
[02:40:03.280 --> 02:40:05.320]  It was pretty obvious that she had orchestrated the attacks
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:06.960]  and when I came out swinging against her
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:08.640]  in a public manner on Twitter and I said,
[02:40:08.640 --> 02:40:10.760]  I know that she is harassing herself
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:13.280]  and that she is behind some funded campaign
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:15.320]  to attack people and try to make them think
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.440]  that it's someone else.
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.440]  I was swiftly covered by leftist media trying to smear me.
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.320]  Basically paint me out as a person
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:24.840]  who fell for a conspiracy theory
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:26.560]  and not someone who had actually lived through a girl
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:28.640]  calling her, threatening her,
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:30.720]  and then sending trolls on her
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:32.400]  and those trolls were not white men, the internet,
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:35.680]  they were women and I am certain that they were
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:37.320]  at that time actually being funded by Twitter
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:41.480]  because she was working as the official anti-harassment
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:43.080]  campaign chief of Twitter.
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:47.720]  Wow, and again, the Southern Primary Law Center,
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:49.480]  the ADL, they've all been caught.
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:51.640]  Mainstream news doing the exact same thing.
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:55.120]  It's beyond hiring actors and of course
[02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:56.560]  there are some real racists out there.
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:00.000]  They're usually super disenfranchised losers.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.240]  They're in their mother's basements.
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:02.760]  Demographically, they hate everybody
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:05.800]  just like the fake left antifas in their mom's basements.
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:08.040]  And I mean, literally, the algorithms show that.
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:10.400]  They're losers who I'm sad for,
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:12.640]  who are blaming somebody else for their own problems.
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:14.800]  But in this whole racial division operation,
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:16.600]  you re-wiki leaks, they say,
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:18.600]  we're gonna use culture war to maintain control.
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.920]  That means race war.
[02:41:19.920 --> 02:41:21.800]  That seems to be imploding right now,
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:23.920]  but it shows the boldness.
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:25.440]  Since you've gone public about this
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:26.880]  and reached millions of people
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:29.520]  with your channel and your riveting testimony,
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.440]  have you had other people reach out to you
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:32.480]  that have had similar things done?
[02:41:32.480 --> 02:41:34.800]  Because I've done this two times.
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.480]  We should do it again.
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:38.040]  People always get mad at us saying,
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.640]  oh my gosh, then you've got the bots.
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:42.920]  Well, we went to discus, that's the third party.
[02:41:42.920 --> 02:41:45.160]  But we can also maybe try to work with them
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:46.560]  is why haven't done this in two years.
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:48.920]  I asked IT, I said, why haven't we tracked
[02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:52.320]  IP addresses to show the guys saying,
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:55.200]  I wanna kill all the whites versus I wanna kill all the blacks
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:56.560]  and all these racial names.
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:57.840]  We found out we're the same groups,
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:59.880]  the same PR firms, the same bots.
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:01.680]  They weren't even hiding themselves.
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:02.800]  And it's like, because Alex,
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.240]  you got tired of the Secret Service coming
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.800]  because of death threats to Obama,
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.200]  you turned it over to third party sites.
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.560]  So discus has all that now.
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.080]  But we've done the reports where they are,
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:15.640]  obviously they wanna end discourse in a video
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.880]  about police brutality or about North Korea,
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:20.720]  whatever, they just go in and say inward here,
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:22.960]  cracker there to do it.
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.600]  So you experienced that yourself, you speak to that.
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:28.120]  Absolutely, and what I've said
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:29.600]  and what I've tried to get out there
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:32.160]  is that they have developed anti-marketing firms.
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:34.760]  So they go out and they actively attack people
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:36.360]  and they try to control the narrative
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:37.640]  in terms of who the people think
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:39.120]  that the attacks are coming from.
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:41.960]  So for me, with this ominous threat,
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:44.480]  if you don't do what I say, white men are gonna attack you.
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:46.160]  And then I say, I'm not gonna do what you say.
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:49.760]  And then all of a sudden every pro-Trump troll
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:50.960]  tries to attack me.
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:52.680]  So they are relying on stupidity
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:54.840]  and they are relying on anatomy on the internet.
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:56.040]  And the reason they came for me
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:58.160]  is that they actually mistakenly thought
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:42:59.240]  that I had created a product
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:01.400]  that was going to be able to unmask trolls
[02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:02.960]  in the middle of the election.
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:04.560]  And imagine if I had created that product,
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.280]  if we were able to say, hey,
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:08.440]  Hillary Clinton has 50 million followers on Twitter.
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:09.560]  Oh, I just actually realized
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:11.120]  that all of these followers are fakes
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:11.960]  and she actually-
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:15.040]  They wanted to get you in their stable of mind control.
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:16.480]  Right, right, absolutely.
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:17.880]  And I'm just, I wasn't stupid enough.
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:19.600]  I understood that the threats weren't real
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:20.440]  and that they were lying
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:25.000]  and that they were using this quite literally a white lie
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.480]  to try to get me to come out swinging against white men
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:28.880]  and grow their forces.
[02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:31.920]  And unfortunately they picked on the wrong person
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:35.680]  and I am back and I feel it is absolutely my duty
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:37.280]  to expose this lie.
[02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:39.320]  And now they're pretty scared
[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:41.120]  because after you came on with Paul and I last week,
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:42.680]  you got censored.
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:44.640]  I did, I got censored immediately
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:47.520]  after I came on with you guys on YouTube
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:50.880]  for a video that did not even have one cuss word in it.
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:54.720]  Let's talk about what they did.
[02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:58.400]  So yeah, I put up a video basically just,
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.720]  not even attacking, I was reading verbatim,
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:03.000]  the list of demands that that Black Lives Matter
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.440]  Louisville chapter member had put out for white people
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:08.320]  which essentially said, I want your homes.
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:11.400]  And you guys are all small, DICK white men.
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:13.520]  It was really racist and it was aggressive
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:14.520]  and it was super ignorant.
[02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:15.920]  And I wanted to speak out against it
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:19.240]  because people like her give African-Americans
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.280]  and Black people in this country a bad reputation.
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:23.840]  And it's important that we stop being afraid
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:25.480]  to be called, of being called coons
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:27.560]  and stand up and say, no, this is BS
[02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:29.320]  and I do not subscribe to this.
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:31.440]  And apparently I don't know if suddenly arrived
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:34.280]  into an era where liking white people
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:36.640]  or defending white people is unacceptable socially.
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:39.800]  So I received an email from YouTube
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:42.280]  which just said that my video had been pulled
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:44.480]  for bullying and harassing.
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:46.240]  I did not bully a single person.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:48.960]  I did not comment on the person who wrote the article.
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:51.560]  I literally read her list and then said why I thought
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:53.840]  it was important that Black people speak out against it
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:56.400]  which basically lets me know that you can be anything
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:59.920]  you want as long as you subscribe to Democrat thought.
[02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:00.840]  They will always propel you.
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:01.800]  They'll always give you a voice,
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:02.640]  always give you a channel.
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.040]  But the second that you get smart
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:05.840]  and you break the chains of thought
[02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:07.720]  and you say, actually I'm educated,
[02:45:07.720 --> 02:45:09.800]  they will pull the carpet from under your feet
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:10.760]  as fast as possible.
[02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:12.720]  And I've now learned this lesson twice.
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.760]  But the goodness is you fought back so they backed off.
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:19.400]  They're always trying until we just give up.
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:21.560]  So it's a war of wills.
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:22.640]  Right, absolutely.
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:25.160]  And credit where it's due, Paul said to me,
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:26.640]  you need to make noise about it.
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:28.280]  Cause I was kind of, I was so shocked.
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:30.280]  I was like, I don't really know what I should do.
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:33.960]  And I just went on a Twitter rant and I spoke about it
[02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:34.920]  and I didn't shut up about it.
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:36.360]  And I tweeted and I tweeted and I tweeted.
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:38.400]  And four hours later they reinstated the video
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:41.120]  without so much as an email, nothing.
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:44.120]  I appealed it on YouTube and basically told them
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:47.400]  that this is obviously, you know, just left this BS
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:49.440]  and they reinstated it.
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:51.920]  Well, you know, I had Ted Nugent on today
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:53.680]  and I just called him Sunday,
[02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:54.960]  yesterday and asked him to come on
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:57.160]  or two days ago and he agreed.
[02:45:57.160 --> 02:45:58.920]  I don't ever come with themes on purpose.
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:01.000]  They just come up from what's happening.
[02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.480]  And a few months ago, massive censorship got launched.
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:04.720]  They admit it's happening.
[02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:05.880]  Everything else was a beta test.
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:06.720]  It's here.
[02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:09.200]  But everywhere where people who are big enough
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:12.080]  complain have allies that work together
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:13.120]  to point out it's happening.
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:14.800]  When Breitbart gets censored, I talk about it.
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:17.160]  If Drudge does, I talk about it because that's me too.
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:19.320]  It's not like I'm just such a perfect person.
[02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:20.160]  No, I understand.
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:22.080]  They get them, they get me next.
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:23.160]  Then they've got to back off.
[02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.200]  It's only the little guys out there
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:26.960]  who would become big they know,
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.440]  who get censored up front.
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:30.640]  And Facebook says, you better not post that again.
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:31.640]  You better watch what you're doing.
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:35.040]  They tell you these messages and people self censor.
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:36.280]  This is so cult-like.
[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:37.960]  This is so anti-America.
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:40.080]  This is so North Korean communist.
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:41.800]  This is so evil.
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:42.640]  It is.
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:43.680]  It's absolutely evil and it's foscious.
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:44.640]  And people don't know this,
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:47.600]  but YouTube operates on a three strike policy.
[02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:49.080]  So not only did they take down my video,
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:50.360]  but they gave me a strike.
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.720]  If you get three strikes on YouTube,
[02:46:51.720 --> 02:46:53.440]  they will pull your channel and delete everything.
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:54.800]  For community guidelines,
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:57.240]  when they empower super guideline members
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:59.960]  that work for them or who they've approved as mods,
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:02.400]  whose vote is a thousand or a hundred,
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:03.720]  depending on their level.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:05.840]  So they've got these little commasars,
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:07.760]  these political officers that go out
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:11.840]  and say, hmm, Candace Owens, YouTube at Red Pill Black,
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.240]  she's calling for true Martin Luther King unity.
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:16.440]  We don't want that ban her.
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:17.280]  Exactly.
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:18.800]  That's literally verbatim.
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:20.880]  That's gotta be the best version of events that happened.
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:22.760]  All I was doing was calling for unity
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:24.800]  and saying that somebody putting out something
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:28.440]  as racist as that list was, was wrong.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:30.320]  And that was apparently unacceptable.
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:31.680]  You cannot say that it's wrong
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:33.040]  to be racist towards white people.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:34.400]  And of course we know what's going on.
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:36.800]  It's in the Wiki Leases and the Ford Foundation.
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:39.480]  They're trying to get white people to become racist,
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:41.440]  to control everybody with racial division,
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:42.520]  like we're a prison,
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:44.000]  where there's the black area, the white area,
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:45.160]  the Hispanic area.
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:46.840]  I mean, that's what they're doing,
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:49.880]  is if enough white people see incredible racism,
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:51.960]  they'll go, oh my gosh, this is really real,
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:54.160]  and then they'll fall into it as well.
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:55.000]  Right, and they do.
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  They almost do fall into it.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.240]  They thank me for the videos and they say,
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:47:59.200]  thank you for putting up this video
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.680]  because for a second I was starting to think
[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:02.840]  that every black person thought like this.
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:04.400]  And every black person wanted my home.
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:06.160]  Every black person thought that they were entitled
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.040]  to everything that I worked for because of slavery,
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:11.040]  which I wasn't even a part of.
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:12.520]  And that is why I say,
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:14.640]  if you are African-American and you see something
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:16.920]  that does not represent us or our culture,
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:21.080]  it is important that you stand up and say something.
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:23.080]  Well, I tell you, Martin Luther King got killed
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.560]  because he wanted unity.
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:26.280]  And as soon as Malcolm X wanted it as well,
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:28.440]  he got killed when he was preaching.
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:29.280]  He went through a lot of stuff
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:30.320]  and I get why he said what he said,
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:31.840]  but once he figured out,
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:32.880]  no, actually we need to unify,
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:34.200]  that's when they killed him.
[02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:37.200]  And it's the same thing here today
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:39.160]  that we've all got problems and nobody's perfect,
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:42.160]  but we're being artificially manipulated
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:44.640]  and we've got to admit the globalists are the main issue.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:46.040]  It doesn't mean there aren't issues.
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.040]  The globalists are manipulating us.
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:50.080]  They admit they're manipulating us
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:52.120]  and we need to just wake up from this nightmare.
[02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:53.160]  And it seems like people like you
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:55.200]  are leading us out of that nightmare.
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:56.040]  Absolutely.
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:58.680]  And again, my focus is on African-Americans.
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:48:59.880]  That's where I come from.
[02:48:59.880 --> 02:49:01.600]  That's where I'm obviously the most attached to.
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:03.640]  I know what I've lived through.
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:06.600]  And I understand the struggle of being black,
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:08.880]  but I also have outthought it
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:10.840]  and I understand what the real issues are.
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  And let me tell you,
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:13.840]  our issues have got nothing to do with white people
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:15.880]  and everything to do with the leftist agenda.
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:18.560]  We have been used like mules over and over again
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.240]  and it's time for us to stop being sheep
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:22.040]  and start being lions.
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:25.120]  Well, most white people I know are guilty
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:27.000]  and they're just working and they feel bad
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.160]  and they wanna prove that they're not bad people.
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:31.480]  And then they're manipulated by these spiders
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:36.480]  that use their good intention to control folks.
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:37.360]  Another white folks.
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:38.400]  They tap into the white guilt.
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:40.120]  That's they tap into the tree of white guilt,
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:41.080]  as I like to say.
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:41.920]  Exactly.
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:44.000]  And then you got others that just will be racist
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.240]  with people and then not be right.
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:47.480]  It's just all just fakes like everybody has.
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:50.320]  But it is a bunch of globalist,
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.600]  high-powered old white people in royalty
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:55.160]  that are using divide and conquer to control all of us.
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:56.240]  So at the end of the day,
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:00.920]  the weird kernel of truth is it is some old rich white people
[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:03.880]  that are actually manipulating all this against everybody
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:06.800]  and that's why they hate people like you so much.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:07.760]  They do, absolutely.
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:09.440]  I'm the first person that they wanna censor
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:12.440]  because they know that the more than my message gets out
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:13.840]  to black people, black people aren't gonna go,
[02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:15.120]  oh, well, she must be a white nationalist.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:17.000]  They're gonna think twice, I look like them.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.600]  So why am I saying something that is ultimately,
[02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:21.320]  if it's ultimately going to hurt me in the end,
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:23.640]  I wouldn't do that, that's nonsensible.
[02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:26.400]  So again, I am the biggest threat to them
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:28.080]  because if I can have a platform
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:30.720]  and I can speak out against it,
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:33.640]  then they're going to lose the remaining base
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.800]  of black people that they have.
[02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:37.360]  That's right, and all this fake racism stuff,
[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:40.160]  gives cover to real racists, but we're tribalists.
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:41.000]  When we come back then,
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.200]  what did you think of Trump in Houston?
[02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:45.600]  How do you think the enemy is gonna strike back?
[02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:47.440]  That's really the big question we're gonna ask
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:50.040]  and Paul Watson is warmed up.
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:51.640]  He's in the gauge, he's ready to go.
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:54.200]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:56.320]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:50:56.320 --> 02:50:58.320]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.360]  Find your happiness with pure soap.

[02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:53.280]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.

[02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:24.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:27.520]  Candace Owens bullies my heart
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:30.720]  to know there are so many great young people
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:33.720]  with beautiful souls, beautiful hearts,
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:35.920]  awake to what's happening.
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:38.280]  But I gotta tell you, there's so many other people
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:42.360]  captured in the bondage of globalist disinformation
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:43.880]  and looking at what happened in Houston
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:45.880]  and how that storm that was to be this big tragedy
[02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:48.800]  and still is blew up in the face
[02:54:48.800 --> 02:54:51.760]  of the whole fake race war narrative
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:54.560]  and then to watch the demons on CNN and MSNBC
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:57.680]  so angry and just so pissed.
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:02.040]  It's like, gosh, where did they find so many evil people?
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.320]  So we're winning in many ways, but also I'm just like hurt.
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:09.760]  Like, why are there so many bad people?
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:12.000]  Well, a lot of greedy globalists got control
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.640]  and they found folks that'll do whatever they're told.
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:16.520]  We just have to turn away from these people
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:18.680]  and promote new independent media like Info Wars
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:22.040]  and the work that she's doing over at Red Pill Black
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:23.400]  on YouTube and Twitter.
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:25.360]  Candace Owens, in a few minutes we've got Lev
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:26.480]  because Paul's coming up.
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:27.800]  I'm gonna let him have the whole hour.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:29.440]  I'll always jump in and take over.
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:31.240]  Paul's gonna be hosting from England.
[02:55:31.240 --> 02:55:32.800]  Other points you'd like to add?
[02:55:34.320 --> 02:55:37.040]  You know, I just would agree with you
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:39.080]  that the media circus, it needs to stop,
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:40.520]  they need to pull back or don't.
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:42.160]  They can keep doing it because at the end of the day
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:44.560]  they are absolutely hurting themselves
[02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:47.480]  and what they have done with or tried to do
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:49.280]  with the Houston narrative is absolutely disgusting.
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:50.520]  What I saw there was beautiful,
[02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:54.720]  what the president did was a phenomenal presidential job.
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:57.480]  And I- Exactly, why can't they stop then?
[02:55:57.480 --> 02:55:58.920]  We don't even wanna hurt them.
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:00.040]  We don't wanna conquer them.
[02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.800]  We just want them to get off our backs.
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:03.480]  Why won't they stop?
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:05.600]  I don't know, what I saw was black people,
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:08.120]  white people, Spanish people, every color, race,
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:10.520]  and creed of an individual coming together
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:13.680]  in what really was a beautiful display
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:15.960]  of not just Americanism, but humanity.
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:18.640]  And if they can't accept that and love that,
[02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:20.640]  then they are just cold people
[02:56:20.640 --> 02:56:23.480]  and I'm happy to be part of the growing number
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:24.880]  of people that are turning them off completely
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:27.360]  because nobody cares what they think.
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:30.960]  Exactly, Candace Owens, in your gut though,
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:35.120]  women's intuition, how are the race controllers
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:36.080]  who are beyond racist?
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:38.280]  They just coldly manipulate folks like psychopaths.
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:40.240]  What's their next attack gonna be then?
[02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:45.520]  Something big and over the top, like Charlottesville,
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:47.440]  I'd have to imagine, they've gotta set up,
[02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:49.200]  they've gotta get cameras there and they've gotta say,
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:51.480]  well, if you don't believe that the race war is happening,
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:53.640]  we're gonna show you something that never happens
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:56.120]  and just keep playing it over and over and over again
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:57.760]  until you are brainwashed to believe
[02:56:57.760 --> 02:56:59.120]  that this is your everyday life.
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:02.080]  But I think their attempts are growing more desperate
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:03.400]  and every time that they do it,
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:05.200]  they reveal a little bit more about themselves
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:07.560]  and I have full confidence that as you said
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:09.840]  and as I've said, people are waking up
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:11.880]  and their days are numbered.
[02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:14.280]  So it's nothing that I fear, whatever they do,
[02:57:14.280 --> 02:57:17.760]  it'll be a big deal in their own echo chamber
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:18.680]  and nowhere else.
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:21.160]  Do they realize they're in an echo chamber?
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:24.360]  They must, I mean, they lost the election.
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:27.960]  They said he was going to lose by 80%, right?
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:29.560]  They had Hillary at 80%.
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:31.520]  So they must at some point realize
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:32.760]  that they're in an echo chamber,
[02:57:32.760 --> 02:57:36.600]  but they're being paid good money by these globalists
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:38.760]  to pretend as, they're like actresses,
[02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:40.120]  like watching an actress on a show.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:42.640]  I mean, at this point, I can't imagine
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:44.480]  that they're all this stupid.
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:47.160]  I have to hope that they're not all this stupid
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:50.000]  but like I said, they get paid to do that
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.160]  and for them, it's just a job.
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:55.280]  Bottom line, George Soros is not happy.
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:57:57.480]  Candice Owens, Red Pill Black,
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:59.920]  people should follow you on YouTube and Twitter.
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:01.520]  Are you gonna watch your own website soon?
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:02.840]  Because they may censor you there.
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:03.680]  You need to-
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:06.880]  Yeah, I just bought the domain named rpblack.com.
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:09.000]  I'm not sure exactly what I'm gonna do with it.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:09.840]  Well, you're awesome.
[02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:10.680]  Hey, you're amazing.
[02:58:10.680 --> 02:58:12.720]  We want you to be a contributor at Info Wars.
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:13.560]  I love you.
[02:58:13.560 --> 02:58:15.040]  Well, we love you.
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.360]  Let's talk soon.
[02:58:16.360 --> 02:58:17.520]  Well, let's talk soon.
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:18.680]  Let's get you flowing down to Austin.
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:20.000]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:21.320]  All right, have a good one.
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:22.160]  You bet.
[02:58:22.160 --> 02:58:23.160]  I am not gonna censor Paul.
[02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:24.640]  I'm always jumping in.
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:26.280]  If his skype's working,
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:28.440]  he will host the fourth hour entirely.
[02:58:28.440 --> 02:58:29.400]  We'll find out though.
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:31.200]  Will I be back in 70 seconds?
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.160]  Let's see.
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:33.000]  Thank you.
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  Whatever you do, spread the link.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.360]  InfoWars.com forward slash a foot.
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:37.760]  It's Paul Watson.
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:39.760]  Look, look, there he is.
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:40.600]  There he is.
[02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:43.240]  As most of you are,
[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:44.480]  more than two years ago,
[02:58:44.480 --> 02:58:47.160]  InfoWars first told you about our research
[02:58:47.160 --> 02:58:49.720]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[02:58:49.720 --> 02:58:52.280]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:55.160]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[02:58:55.160 --> 02:58:58.160]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[02:58:58.160 --> 02:59:00.040]  out of the food and adding fluoride,
[02:59:00.040 --> 02:59:02.680]  the bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[02:59:02.680 --> 02:59:04.440]  They took the good halogen out
[02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:06.360]  and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:08.400]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:10.120]  as it still is worsening today,
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:11.360]  I was there telling you
[02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:13.240]  how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:17.320]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[02:59:17.320 --> 02:59:20.520]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:22.640]  which many experts are now saying
[02:59:22.640 --> 02:59:26.160]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:28.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:29.480]  This is the real deal, folks,
[02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:31.560]  and the truth is that iodine is essential,
[02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:34.320]  in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:59:34.320 --> 02:59:38.600]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:59:38.600 --> 02:59:43.400]  or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:59:45.160 --> 02:59:48.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:48.240 --> 03:00:10.600]  Real live, it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:14.080]  We have a special guest coming up at the bottom of the hour
[03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:15.640]  to talk about YouTube censorship
[03:00:15.640 --> 03:00:17.360]  and how it's being implemented
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:20.080]  and why it's being implemented.
[03:00:20.080 --> 03:00:22.000]  First off, we're gonna hit some news stories,
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.240]  though, of course, we're living in a time of mass hysteria.
[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:28.200]  The media has contrived this moral panic
[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:31.600]  over white supremacists, over neo-Nazis, over racists.
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:35.240]  They're doubling down on the same identity politics
[03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:37.320]  that lost them the election.
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:40.880]  In fact, salon.com came out with an article a few days ago,
[03:00:40.880 --> 03:00:43.760]  which basically saying it's time for progressives
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:45.560]  to give up on identity politics
[03:00:45.560 --> 03:00:47.080]  because it's not working.
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:50.440]  The response to that article was vehement to say the least.
[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:52.880]  The very top comment was from somebody
[03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:55.040]  who is obsessed with identity politics,
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:57.640]  saying that this opinion was just the writer
[03:00:57.640 --> 03:00:59.800]  expressing his white privilege.
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:01.840]  So they still don't get it,
[03:01:01.840 --> 03:01:05.880]  even though it's been an electoral failure over and over again,
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:08.240]  they're still doubling down on race obsession
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:11.240]  and identity politics, which we should welcome
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:12.880]  because it doesn't work for them.
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:14.280]  It doesn't resonate.
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:17.200]  It doesn't substitute for having actual policies
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:19.000]  for having an actual argument.
[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.160]  But they're still running with it.
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:23.920]  And part of that is this contrived mass hysteria,
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:26.440]  this moral panic, of course,
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:28.440]  which really built up after Charlottesville.
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:31.680]  Now we've got up in Canada, Calgary police saying that
[03:01:31.680 --> 03:01:35.120]  if your child listens to heavy metal music,
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:38.680]  that might mean they're part of a racist hate group.
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:40.760]  They actually put out an advisory to parents
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:42.520]  with a list of behaviors
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:45.680]  that may indicate your child is part of a racist hate group.
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:48.800]  Listening to heavy metal music was one of them.
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:52.240]  Another one of them was not being keen on school.
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:54.960]  That was one of the characteristics of somebody
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:59.240]  who's probably maybe thinking about joining a racist hate group.
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:00.920]  So we see how this spreads.
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:04.040]  We had the whole panic over Nazi haircuts.
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:06.200]  Remember that when Eric Trump got a haircut
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:07.960]  and they said he was a Nazi?
[03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:10.040]  Macklemore had to come out on Twitter,
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:11.880]  the performer, the singer,
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:15.360]  and apologize for a haircut that he had a year ago
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:18.240]  because people said it was the new fascist haircut.
[03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:19.920]  He had to apologize for that,
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:22.000]  even though it's literally the hairstyle favored
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.040]  by the majority of Western males
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:25.600]  between the age of 18 to 40.
[03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:27.040]  That doesn't matter.
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:28.760]  We're having a moral panic here.
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:29.760]  This is hysteria.
[03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:31.760]  You have to go along with it.
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:34.560]  Of course, we had CNN a couple of weeks ago
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:37.360]  publish an article saying that basically all Trump supporters,
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:39.280]  63 million Americans,
[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:42.040]  including nearly 4 million black people,
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:44.680]  were white supremacists by default.
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:46.760]  We have an article on infowars.com today.
[03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:49.880]  Former Bush advisor, former Bush official,
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:52.880]  says that 100% of Trump supporters are racist.
[03:02:52.880 --> 03:02:55.520]  People have a backlash against that.
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:02:57.960]  And he's like, oh my God, what is going on?
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:02:59.240]  People are angry at me.
[03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:02.560]  Yeah, you just called 63 million people racist.
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:05.600]  Of course, people are gonna have their say on that.
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:07.680]  So they're still running with this.
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:11.560]  We have gone with the wind now being banned in some cinemas
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:13.280]  because it might offend people,
[03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:16.000]  even though literally that was the first movie
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:19.200]  out of which a black actor won an Academy Award.
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:20.280]  No, we have to ban that.
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:22.240]  It might hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:25.480]  We have artist impressions of Abraham Lincoln
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:28.560]  being torn down because that might offend somebody.
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:30.760]  That might hurt somebody's feelings.
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:32.280]  And now we have this today.
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:35.080]  This is out of campus reform.
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:38.920]  Academic conference aims to de-center English
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:40.680]  in higher education.
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:41.880]  That's right.
[03:03:41.880 --> 03:03:45.800]  They're literally now saying that speaking English
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:48.760]  is a racist microaggression
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:52.760]  because the majority of people in the United States of America
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:55.600]  and the United Kingdom speak English.
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:57.840]  And of course, those are the two most racist,
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:00.480]  oppressive nations on the planet.
[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:02.440]  It doesn't matter that they're actually the most tolerant,
[03:04:02.440 --> 03:04:04.320]  the most welcoming two immigrants
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:06.720]  to the point where Europe has basically
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:08.320]  committed suicide at this point
[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:10.160]  because of its tolerance now.
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:11.720]  We're racist.
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:12.640]  We have to be punished.
[03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:15.560]  And by the way, you have to hand in your research papers.
[03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:17.480]  This is not the onion, okay?
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:19.240]  You have to hand in your research papers
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:22.240]  in a different language other than English.
[03:04:22.240 --> 03:04:24.080]  Otherwise you might be racist.
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:26.080]  This is an actual story.
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:28.800]  Worried that xenophobia and nationalism are on the rise,
[03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:31.160]  organizers of a recent academic conference.
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:35.320]  Paul, it's the official Social Studies World Group
[03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:36.320]  meeting in Boston.
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:38.400]  This is the brains of the brains.
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:40.920]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:44.040]  It's babolism, Paul.
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:44.960]  It's babolism.
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:46.000]  They don't want to be able to communicate.
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:47.440]  Sorry, they'll be right back.
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:51.480]  December 23rd, 1776.
[03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:54.160]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:04:54.160 --> 03:04:56.640]  The summer soldier and the Sunshine Patriot Wheel
[03:04:56.640 --> 03:04:59.200]  in this crisis shrink from the service of their country.
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:02.680]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:03.960]  of man and woman.
[03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:06.600]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[03:05:06.600 --> 03:05:08.640]  Yet we have this consolation with us
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:11.600]  that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[03:05:11.600 --> 03:05:14.600]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[03:05:14.600 --> 03:05:17.560]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[03:05:17.560 --> 03:05:20.720]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[03:05:20.720 --> 03:05:22.480]  And it would be strange indeed
[03:05:22.480 --> 03:05:24.640]  if so celestial an article as freedom
[03:05:24.640 --> 03:05:26.320]  should not be highly rated.
[03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:28.880]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny
[03:05:28.880 --> 03:05:31.840]  has declared that she has a right not only to tax,
[03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:34.680]  but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[03:05:34.680 --> 03:05:37.280]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery,
[03:05:37.280 --> 03:05:39.840]  then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth.
[03:05:39.840 --> 03:05:41.640]  Even the expression is impious,
[03:05:41.640 --> 03:05:45.800]  for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[03:05:45.800 --> 03:05:48.880]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[03:05:48.880 --> 03:05:50.160]  As most of you already know,
[03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:53.480]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:05:53.480 --> 03:05:56.200]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more
[03:05:56.200 --> 03:05:58.160]  research, I came across the fact
[03:05:58.160 --> 03:06:01.600]  that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[03:06:01.600 --> 03:06:04.120]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases
[03:06:04.120 --> 03:06:06.600]  had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:09.840]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:11.880]  of the animals that they were hunting,
[03:06:11.880 --> 03:06:13.280]  killing and then processing.
[03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:15.880]  And so I set out to develop caveman,
[03:06:15.880 --> 03:06:19.440]  but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[03:06:19.440 --> 03:06:22.640]  but seven other superfood ingredients
[03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:26.080]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body
[03:06:26.080 --> 03:06:27.200]  at the same time.
[03:06:27.200 --> 03:06:29.640]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist,
[03:06:29.640 --> 03:06:33.120]  we're getting results and we're expanding in the face
[03:06:33.120 --> 03:06:35.800]  of the complete media assault and winning

[03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:39.280]  Caveman is back in stock.

[03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:47.440]  That's infowarslife.com.
[03:07:47.440 --> 03:07:51.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[03:07:51.640 --> 03:07:53.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:05.640]  We're live. It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:08.640]  We were talking about the academic conference in Boston
[03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:12.640]  where they basically said you need to present your research papers
[03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:14.640]  in a language other than English,
[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:17.640]  otherwise it might be a racist microaggression.
[03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:19.640]  We're going to have to start presenting this show
[03:08:19.640 --> 03:08:21.640]  via sign language from now on
[03:08:21.640 --> 03:08:26.640]  because it might offend somebody if we're speaking English.
[03:08:26.640 --> 03:08:28.640]  That is a reasonable argument.
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:30.640]  I mean, let's be fair with them.
[03:08:30.640 --> 03:08:35.640]  Listen to the justification that they had for enforcing this policy.
[03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:37.640]  Quote, this is from the article,
[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:39.640]  while English has become a scientific lingua franca
[03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:42.640]  that has been favored in communications and networking
[03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:44.640]  across the globe,
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:48.640]  it is the official language of just a handful of countries,
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:52.640]  most prominently the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:57.640]  And we, of course, we know they are the most evil racist countries in the world.
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:09:00.640]  I mean, let's not talk about South Africa
[03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:02.640]  where white people are literally being driven off their land
[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:04.640]  and putting cages because of their skin colour.
[03:09:04.640 --> 03:09:06.640]  Let's not talk about that.
[03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:08.640]  Let's not talk about racism in China,
[03:09:08.640 --> 03:09:10.640]  which is basically open and part of the culture
[03:09:10.640 --> 03:09:12.640]  where they literally make monkey noises
[03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:14.640]  at people who have slightly darker skin.
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:16.640]  No, don't talk about that.
[03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:19.640]  Talk about the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
[03:09:19.640 --> 03:09:21.640]  The United Kingdom is so racist.
[03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:26.640]  We literally allow in 300,000 new immigrants
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:29.640]  every single year into a tiny island nation.
[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:31.640]  That's how racist we are.
[03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:35.640]  That's how bigoted and evil and intolerant we are.
[03:09:35.640 --> 03:09:37.640]  So we need to be punished.
[03:09:37.640 --> 03:09:39.640]  The United Kingdom, white people,
[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:43.640]  William Wilberforce were literally the first to ban slavery
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:45.640]  in the entire world.
[03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:48.640]  There are still millions of slaves and slaves across the world.
[03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:50.640]  None of them by white people, but forget about that.
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:51.640]  We're evil.
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:53.640]  We need to be punished.
[03:09:53.640 --> 03:09:56.640]  How dare you speak English?
[03:09:56.640 --> 03:10:00.640]  In academia, in the United States of America,
[03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:02.640]  you dirty, bigoted racist,
[03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:05.640]  you need to comply to this new mandate.
[03:10:05.640 --> 03:10:08.640]  That was the actual explanation they gave.
[03:10:08.640 --> 03:10:10.640]  They went on to say,
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:14.640]  they asserted that the current policies of these two countries
[03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:18.640]  send a message of insulation and parochialism to the world,
[03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:22.640]  explicitly threatening the richness and importance of human difference.
[03:10:22.640 --> 03:10:27.640]  Literally the two countries where everybody who doesn't live in them
[03:10:27.640 --> 03:10:30.640]  tries to flock from the third world.
[03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:31.640]  Okay?
[03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:33.640]  So they're so racist.
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:35.640]  Why is everyone trying to get here?
[03:10:35.640 --> 03:10:37.640]  Have you ever asked yourself that?
[03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:39.640]  No, we have to be punished.
[03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:41.640]  Nobody can speak English anymore.
[03:10:41.640 --> 03:10:44.640]  In fact, they should probably have mandatory reeducation centers
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:47.640]  where everybody has to learn Chinese, Spanish, whatever.
[03:10:47.640 --> 03:10:49.640]  Swahili.
[03:10:49.640 --> 03:10:51.640]  Because, God forbid, we should be called racist.
[03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:54.640]  Just cut out our tongues and save some time.
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:55.640]  I mean, come on.
[03:10:55.640 --> 03:10:57.640]  Don't be a bigot.
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:10:59.640]  So that's what's going on in colleges in the United States.
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:01.640]  We also have this.
[03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:06.640]  College to offer thrice weekly cuddles with therapy dogs.
[03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:08.640]  Again, not the onion.
[03:11:08.640 --> 03:11:11.640]  It would have been the onion 15 years ago, not anymore.
[03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:14.640]  The University of North Texas now offers students weekly healing sessions
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:16.640]  with therapy dogs.
[03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:19.640]  According to an advertisement for the therapeutic sessions
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:22.640]  put out by the university's counseling and testing services department,
[03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:26.640]  students are invited to join Rockstar the therapy dog
[03:11:26.640 --> 03:11:31.640]  for some de-stressing art every Thursday throughout the semester.
[03:11:31.640 --> 03:11:34.640]  So they might have been stressed
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:38.640]  had they inadvertently encountered a different opinion.
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:39.640]  Of course, we can't have that.
[03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:41.640]  Every university has to be a safe space.
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:44.640]  They can't be challenged on any of their views.
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:46.640]  So these therapy dogs, these therapy puppies
[03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:48.640]  have been brought in to help them.
[03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:51.640]  Quote, we provide you with supplies to complete an art project
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:54.640]  designed to increase self-awareness, compassion, and gratitude.
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:56.640]  And it goes on.
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:12:00.640]  So they literally bring in a bunch of puppies for them to hug,
[03:12:00.640 --> 03:12:04.640]  to de-stress as therapy.
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:07.640]  Which again goes back to this whole depression thing
[03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:11.640]  where now everybody has to have emotional incontinence.
[03:12:11.640 --> 03:12:13.640]  There's no such thing as stoicism.
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:17.640]  You have to vent your spleen about every little infraction.
[03:12:17.640 --> 03:12:20.640]  If you see a pocket constitution, you've got to have Play-Doh
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:23.640]  and, you know, drawing paper like you're three years old.
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:25.640]  It's a rest of development.
[03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:26.640]  No, exactly.
[03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:30.640]  And that's the video I made a few months ago, Alex, about, you know,
[03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:32.640]  this is the daycare generation.
[03:12:32.640 --> 03:12:35.640]  They weren't given enough attention in daycare,
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:37.640]  so they've carried it forward.
[03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:40.640]  Now they're being taught at these reeducation centers,
[03:12:40.640 --> 03:12:44.640]  which are now openly political reeducation centers.
[03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:47.640]  We had a story yesterday about how one of the new courses,
[03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:49.640]  I think this was also in Boston,
[03:12:49.640 --> 03:12:53.640]  was the resistance course, the anti-Trump course,
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:57.640]  literally a politically political reeducation.
[03:12:57.640 --> 03:12:58.640]  Now over.
[03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:00.640]  They're not even hiding it anymore.
[03:13:00.640 --> 03:13:04.640]  They have the indoctrination that words are weapons.
[03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:06.640]  So that's how they ban free speech.
[03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:08.640]  That's not just an opposing argument.
[03:13:08.640 --> 03:13:11.640]  It's literally a weapon that is going to sprout fists
[03:13:11.640 --> 03:13:13.640]  and start attacking me.
[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:15.640]  So they have coloring crayons.
[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:17.640]  They have puppies that they can hug.
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:19.640]  And it's all part of this insanity.
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:22.640]  But remember, these people are coming out of these colleges.
[03:13:22.640 --> 03:13:26.640]  They're getting jobs through all the diversity hires.
[03:13:26.640 --> 03:13:28.640]  So they can get a job,
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:30.640]  even though they got some useless degree in gender.
[03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:35.640]  Reality winner, top secret clearance, Al-Qaeda operative.
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:38.640]  They have diversity hires, Alex,
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:40.640]  where you don't need to have the skills.
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:42.640]  You don't need to have the qualifications anymore.
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:46.640]  If you can claim to be part of an oppressed group,
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:48.640]  maybe it's a transgender person.
[03:13:48.640 --> 03:13:49.640]  Maybe it's just a woman.
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:52.640]  Maybe you can claim you're a quarter Swahili or whatever.
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:13:53.640]  You're oppressed.
[03:13:53.640 --> 03:13:55.640]  You've got some oppressional and picks points.
[03:13:55.640 --> 03:13:59.640]  They will hire you even though you don't have the skills to do the job.
[03:13:59.640 --> 03:14:03.640]  That's what many of these are conservatives now in Silicon Valley
[03:14:03.640 --> 03:14:04.640]  coming out and saying.
[03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:07.640]  They're increasingly working around with people
[03:14:07.640 --> 03:14:10.640]  who obviously don't have the skills to do the job.
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:13.640]  They do have the skills to send to people on the internet
[03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:15.640]  for having a different opinion.
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:20.640]  Hence, we have the YouTube heroes program where people mass flag content.
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:25.640]  Hence, we have the new limited state program where controversial opinions
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:27.640]  are hidden behind an electronic Berlin wall.
[03:14:27.640 --> 03:14:28.640]  So we know the future.
[03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:30.640]  During the robot takeover,
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:33.640]  they'll have little liberal helpers blocking humans from fighting back.
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:35.640]  This is the plan.
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:36.640]  Yeah.
[03:14:36.640 --> 03:14:39.640]  So when we, you know, we derive these people on a daily basis,
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:41.640]  the point is they're coming out of those colleges.
[03:14:41.640 --> 03:14:43.640]  They're being given positions of power.
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:47.640]  These are the people who they want to run your life.
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:50.640]  So again, there's this, there's this, you know, backlash to this,
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:52.640]  which says, oh, that's just complete idiocy.
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:54.640]  Why are you even paying attention to it?
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:56.640]  No, these are your new rulers.
[03:14:56.640 --> 03:15:00.640]  They just cost us $15 million this year,
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:03.640]  cutting the soft, demonetizing us and blocking us on Google.
[03:15:03.640 --> 03:15:05.640]  What the hell do you mean we're bitching?
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:07.640]  They're running the whole show.
[03:15:07.640 --> 03:15:08.640]  Exactly.
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:12.640]  And then they go out and start, you know, throwing water on disabled people,
[03:15:12.640 --> 03:15:14.640]  attacking women with American flags,
[03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:18.640]  pepper spraying women in the face and big Hollywood celebrities,
[03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:22.640]  big mainstream media outlets come out and say, yes, this is moral.
[03:15:22.640 --> 03:15:23.640]  We support these people.
[03:15:23.640 --> 03:15:27.640]  We support these ski mask wearing chicken necked thugs.
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:28.640]  Oh, and by the way,
[03:15:28.640 --> 03:15:32.640]  they're just like the brave soldiers who landed on the beach at Normandy.
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:35.640]  Literally, they came out and said that a few weeks ago, Alex,
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:39.640]  of course, since some of them have backed away now because on the face of it,
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:42.640]  it was so patently absurd.
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:45.640]  But these are the people who are now going to be running your lives.
[03:15:45.640 --> 03:15:48.640]  You know, they're going to skip this break in the 50s.
[03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:50.640]  You have more time, even though I popped in Paul.
[03:15:50.640 --> 03:15:53.640]  I am sitting here eating my lunch watching you though.
[03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:55.640]  This is really powerful.
[03:15:55.640 --> 03:15:58.640]  These are the people who we talk about terror attacks,
[03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:00.640]  the backlash to terror attacks.
[03:16:00.640 --> 03:16:03.640]  Barcelona, of course, happened a few weeks ago.
[03:16:03.640 --> 03:16:08.640]  Now it's moved beyond the stage of changing your Facebook profile picture,
[03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:11.640]  tweeting, pray for whatever city fill in the blank.
[03:16:11.640 --> 03:16:14.640]  They actually reacted to the Barcelona terror attack.
[03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:20.640]  And this goes back to the infantilization of young people by insisting that
[03:16:20.640 --> 03:16:23.640]  nobody share images of the attack,
[03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:26.640]  even if they weren't explicitly gory images, which by the way,
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:31.640]  people need to see the consequences of the policies that they have advocated.
[03:16:31.640 --> 03:16:34.640]  Just any image of the attack, like emergency vehicles or whatever,
[03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:39.640]  they insisted nobody do that and instead everybody share pictures of cats
[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:43.640]  on Twitter and they made it aftermath of the Barcelona terror attack.
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:46.640]  This is pre-AI probing for the global takeover.
[03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:50.640]  They're trying to turn off our life force instinct, Paul.
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:56.640]  Yeah, they've literally bred this toys out of the prime generation,
[03:16:56.640 --> 03:16:58.640]  ostrich-like behavior.
[03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:01.640]  Now they can't even deflect from it.
[03:17:01.640 --> 03:17:04.640]  They can't even like pander to the emotional aspect of it.
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:06.640]  They can't even handle that anymore.
[03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:09.640]  It's like, no, everybody just start posting pictures of cats.
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:11.640]  That's how we're going to deal with it.
[03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:13.640]  Literally like sticking their fingers in their ears and going,
[03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:14.640]  wow, wow, wow.
[03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:17.640]  That's actually what's going on now.
[03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:19.640]  So they've moved beyond that stage.
[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:22.640]  And now we see the mass hysteria kicking in.
[03:17:22.640 --> 03:17:25.640]  There was a great post a few days ago,
[03:17:25.640 --> 03:17:29.640]  which was called a handy guide to the language of the old left.
[03:17:29.640 --> 03:17:32.640]  And this is literally what they've embraced.
[03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:34.640]  People have made memes about it.
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:35.640]  Here's the guide.
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:37.640]  Here's the language guide to the old left.
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:38.640]  Fascist.
[03:17:38.640 --> 03:17:40.640]  Someone I disagree with.
[03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:41.640]  Nazi.
[03:17:41.640 --> 03:17:43.640]  Someone I really disagree with.
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:45.640]  White supremacist.
[03:17:45.640 --> 03:17:48.640]  Someone I disagree with who is white.
[03:17:48.640 --> 03:17:49.640]  Internalized misogyny.
[03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:52.640]  Someone I disagree with who is a woman.
[03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:54.640]  Low information voter.
[03:17:54.640 --> 03:17:57.640]  Someone I disagree with who is working class.
[03:17:57.640 --> 03:18:00.640]  Someone I disagree with about immigration.
[03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:01.640]  Islamophobes.
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:03.640]  Someone I disagree with about Islam.
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:04.640]  Transphobe.
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:07.640]  Someone I disagree with who understands biology.
[03:18:07.640 --> 03:18:09.640]  Post truth world.
[03:18:09.640 --> 03:18:13.640]  I can't believe how many people disagree with me.
[03:18:13.640 --> 03:18:16.640]  So literally you go down the line.
[03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:18.640]  It boils down to that point.
[03:18:18.640 --> 03:18:21.640]  Anyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi.
[03:18:21.640 --> 03:18:25.640]  Now you've got actual never Trump as ex Bush people coming out
[03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:27.640]  basically using that argument as we talk about it.
[03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:28.640]  Oh yeah.
[03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:30.640]  The new guy coming out saying all Trump supporters are Nazis.
[03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:32.640]  Your article is up on infowords.com.
[03:18:32.640 --> 03:18:33.640]  But here's the deal.
[03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:35.640]  You keep saying God they're crazy.
[03:18:35.640 --> 03:18:38.640]  You expose it in your videos about the CIA and architecture and art.
[03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:39.640]  They know this.
[03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:41.640]  This is weaponized.
[03:18:41.640 --> 03:18:43.640]  They know it doesn't make sense.
[03:18:43.640 --> 03:18:44.640]  It's weaponized, Paul.
[03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:48.640]  So how do we get the public to admit it's not an intellectual debate about left versus right.
[03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:51.640]  This is scientific brainwashing.
[03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:53.640]  Well, it is weaponized.
[03:18:53.640 --> 03:18:57.640]  And it's not the fact that people are just melting down and becoming hysterical.
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:03.640]  It's designed to be this way because that is the Marxist goal to overthrow everything that is in existence,
[03:19:03.640 --> 03:19:05.640]  whether good or bad.
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:08.640]  We're talking about the entire Western capitalist system,
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:11.640]  the entire Enlightenment set of values.
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:12.640]  Exactly.
[03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:13.640]  We don't defend all of it.
[03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:15.640]  This is an overwrite.
[03:19:15.640 --> 03:19:18.640]  They admit it's a total overwrite.
[03:19:18.640 --> 03:19:19.640]  Exactly.
[03:19:19.640 --> 03:19:27.640]  And whether they're aware of it or not, the more dominant force that will come in and start to run everything will be Islam.
[03:19:27.640 --> 03:19:28.640]  Because it's dominant.
[03:19:28.640 --> 03:19:29.640]  It's aggressive.
[03:19:29.640 --> 03:19:31.640]  They will take over whether they like it or not.
[03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:34.640]  Maybe not in the United States or it may take a long time.
[03:19:34.640 --> 03:19:36.640]  But in Europe, that's already happening.
[03:19:36.640 --> 03:19:40.640]  And that's why they're now just capitulating and teaming up with it.
[03:19:40.640 --> 03:19:43.640]  We had an article out of Germany today.
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:45.640]  And we've seen this before.
[03:19:45.640 --> 03:19:50.640]  Germany, police tell women not to run alone after migrant rapes jogger in park.
[03:19:50.640 --> 03:19:55.640]  So you had a woman in her fifties jogging on a Friday morning.
[03:19:55.640 --> 03:19:58.640]  It's not as if this was late at night, which would be no excuse.
[03:19:58.640 --> 03:20:00.640]  You may understand that an attack would be more likely.
[03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:03.640]  Yeah, as Cologne last year said, don't wear hot skirts.
[03:20:03.640 --> 03:20:05.640]  We're going to ban Germans drinking outside at night.
[03:20:05.640 --> 03:20:06.640]  Because you're making a muslim.
[03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:08.640]  So more capitulation.
[03:20:08.640 --> 03:20:16.640]  Yeah, remember the mayor in Cologne after the mass molestation of literally 1200 women by 2000 men, almost all of whom were muslim migrants.
[03:20:16.640 --> 03:20:21.640]  She came out and said, hold the rapist to arms length and walk around in groups.
[03:20:21.640 --> 03:20:23.640]  And that's how you deal with it.
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:24.640]  They literally gave the same advice.
[03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:32.640]  They said that women need to start jogging in pairs or they need to make sure that someone else is around and get this.
[03:20:32.640 --> 03:20:33.640]  This is a quote.
[03:20:33.640 --> 03:20:36.640]  When they run past someone, this is the police in Germany.
[03:20:36.640 --> 03:20:42.640]  When they run past someone, joggers should always look back to make sure they are not about to be attacked.
[03:20:42.640 --> 03:20:46.640]  So it's literally you have to constantly look behind your shoulder.
[03:20:46.640 --> 03:20:50.640]  And they also have a little remember the right things in German.
[03:20:50.640 --> 03:20:53.640]  Don't write me right bracelets.
[03:20:53.640 --> 03:20:54.640]  Yeah.
[03:20:54.640 --> 03:20:55.640]  And I think it was in Finland.
[03:20:55.640 --> 03:21:00.640]  They had the force where it was literally holding their arms out and telling them to back off.
[03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:05.640]  But again, as he said, this is capitulation to Islamic modesty culture.
[03:21:05.640 --> 03:21:06.640]  It's worse than that.
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:11.640]  Paul, the mayor of Cologne said, you're wearing too short of skirts, honey.
[03:21:11.640 --> 03:21:13.640]  And she's like this fake Green Party feminist.
[03:21:13.640 --> 03:21:14.640]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:23.640]  And the day after all the feminists went out to the local migrant center and gave them roses after 1200 women have been molested by migrants.
[03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:25.640]  So that's how the feminists responded.
[03:21:25.640 --> 03:21:29.640]  But yeah, it's this capitulation to Islamic modesty culture.
[03:21:29.640 --> 03:21:38.640]  While they bring in hundreds of thousands of people a year from a culture that produced something literally called the rape game, which we've seen.
[03:21:38.640 --> 03:21:45.640]  You know, Laura Logan was a victim of it in Tahia Square, where they literally just mass molest women because they're not covered up.
[03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:48.640]  Let's talk about the rape game and how you're anti Islam.
[03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:50.640]  You don't support rape.
[03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:51.640]  Exactly.
[03:21:51.640 --> 03:22:01.640]  And also, of course, in Afghanistan, US troops blew the whistle on Bacha Barsi, which is where the old men in Afghanistan get to rape little boys.
[03:22:01.640 --> 03:22:04.640]  And it's OK because it's just part of their culture.
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:08.640]  And of course, many of the migrants coming over are from Afghanistan.
[03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:13.640]  You see boys at swimming pools being molested, being raped and the migrants respond.
[03:22:13.640 --> 03:22:16.640]  They wait around for the police to come by the way.
[03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:22.640]  It's not like they actually think they've even done anything wrong and say, oh, it was a sexual emergency.
[03:22:22.640 --> 03:22:24.640]  I was just a bit horny.
[03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:25.640]  So I mean, what's the big deal?
[03:22:25.640 --> 03:22:26.640]  What's the big deal?
[03:22:26.640 --> 03:22:32.640]  They say when a Muslim rapes your daughter or son is liberal.
[03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:33.640]  Exactly.
[03:22:33.640 --> 03:22:45.640]  And actually in some countries like France, they're hiring lifeguards, they're hiring Muslim migrants as lifeguards to deal with the fact that people are being molested in swimming pools.
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:50.640]  So it's not let's deal with these people who are all responsible for all the molestation.
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:57.640]  No, let's give them positions of authority at the very places where those sexual assaults are taking place.
[03:22:57.640 --> 03:22:59.640]  This is the insanity that's gripping Europe.
[03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:01.640]  This is the capitulation.
[03:23:01.640 --> 03:23:04.640]  Total capitulation.
[03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:07.640]  And we have another article out of Breitbart today, Alex.
[03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:12.640]  Swedish summer festivals see over 150 sex attacks, 20 rapes this year.
[03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:14.640]  This is getting even worse.
[03:23:14.640 --> 03:23:24.640]  The summer festival season in Sweden is over for the year, but reports claim that they're over 150 cases of sex attacks, including 20 rapes at various festivals around the country.
[03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:28.640]  And Merkel says if we make whole towns Muslim, that'll fix it.
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:35.640]  Yeah, they literally deluge villages of 150 people with like 700 migrants and said, just deal with it.
[03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:39.640]  Oh, by the way, if you complain about it on Facebook, we'll send police around to your house.
[03:23:39.640 --> 03:23:40.640]  That's freedom.
[03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:41.640]  That's freedom, Alex.
[03:23:41.640 --> 03:23:49.640]  So now we've got this situation in Sweden. We had three years ago, massive cover up by the police that the fact that these sexual assaults were taking place.
[03:23:49.640 --> 03:23:56.640]  In some cases, literally women being raped in the middle of a field while a concert is going on around them.
[03:23:56.640 --> 03:23:57.640]  This is spiking.
[03:23:57.640 --> 03:24:00.640]  There were a total of 150 sex assaults at the 25.
[03:24:00.640 --> 03:24:01.640]  And I dare folks to watch those videos.
[03:24:01.640 --> 03:24:08.640]  Those videos gave me nightmares where they hold a woman down like 40 guys line up and rape the hell out of her and the cops stand by and watch.
[03:24:08.640 --> 03:24:10.640]  Good Lord.
[03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:12.640]  Absolutely chilling.
[03:24:12.640 --> 03:24:19.640]  Meanwhile, over in the UK, we talked about this story last week that's being picked up more widely, more detail on it.
[03:24:19.640 --> 03:24:26.640]  Student probed by uni bosses for hate crime after calling ISIS barbarians in mocking Facebook posts.
[03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:29.640]  This is the guy at Edinburgh University.
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:33.640]  Let's read exactly what he posted on Facebook.
[03:24:33.640 --> 03:24:40.640]  So this was in response to the massive bombardment of an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan back in April. You remember that story.
[03:24:40.640 --> 03:24:42.640]  The mother of all bombs.
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:48.640]  Robbie Travers, who is a 21 year old student at the University of Edinburgh wrote in response to that news story.
[03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:54.640]  I'm glad we could bring these barbarians a step closer to collecting their 72 virgins.
[03:24:54.640 --> 03:25:04.640]  So he's literally posting about ISIS terrorists being killed mocking ISIS.
[03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:08.640]  And for that, he's being investigated for hate crime because that may have offended Muslims.
[03:25:08.640 --> 03:25:10.640]  Okay, so who's the Islamophobe here?
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:18.640]  The university is insinuating that Muslims or Muslims would be offended by somebody mocking ISIS.
[03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:21.640]  But wait, I thought ISIS had nothing to do with Islam.
[03:25:21.640 --> 03:25:29.640]  If you want to play it on their level, if you want to get into their narrative, the actual Islamophobia is being committed by the university.
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:32.640]  You can't mock ISIS. You can't make fun of them.
[03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:35.640]  That's now a hate crime. He's being investigated.
[03:25:35.640 --> 03:25:39.640]  This is what's taking place in universities in the United Kingdom.
[03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:42.640]  While in the US, you can't talk English because that's racist.
[03:25:42.640 --> 03:25:44.640]  So you can't mock ISIS.
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:46.640]  Meanwhile, ISIS is now sending out a call.
[03:25:46.640 --> 03:25:50.640]  But don't criticize it because you might poison supermarket food.
[03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:52.640]  Exactly.
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:57.640]  So they literally want to inject fruit and vegetables with cyanide.
[03:25:57.640 --> 03:26:00.640]  They've put it out in their official propaganda manual.
[03:26:00.640 --> 03:26:03.640]  And I guess that is technically a cultural enrichment.
[03:26:03.640 --> 03:26:11.640]  And the answer will be a new TSA to test every fruit, every orange, every apple instead of keeping ISIS people out, Paul.
[03:26:11.640 --> 03:26:14.640]  It technically is cultural enrichment.
[03:26:14.640 --> 03:26:20.640]  So if you don't embrace it, you know, somebody somewhere might be offended, Alex.
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:21.640]  So let's just.
[03:26:21.640 --> 03:26:24.640]  So I don't need a cyanide apple. I'm bad.
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:28.640]  Yeah. And don't make fun of ISIS because that's bad. That's a hate crime.
[03:26:28.640 --> 03:26:32.640]  This is what's taking place in academia.
[03:26:32.640 --> 03:26:34.640]  This is what's happening.
[03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:36.640]  We talk about it every day.
[03:26:36.640 --> 03:26:37.640]  And again, these people are taking jobs.
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:39.640]  These people are going to be ruling your life soon.
[03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:41.640]  So we've got that going on.
[03:26:41.640 --> 03:26:45.640]  We've got the whole. They know there's a billion and a half mussels, about to be three billion in 10 years.
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:47.640]  They're having like seven kids on average.
[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:49.640]  The globalists think this is a winning formula.
[03:26:49.640 --> 03:27:01.640]  They're really going to make us all eat cyanide oranges and put burkas on top of little girdles and chop their genitals off with the loppers and just run around screaming, Durga, Durga, Muhammad, Jahad.
[03:27:01.640 --> 03:27:09.640]  Well, I mean, the thing about Europe now, Alex, is, and if you read The Strange Death of Europe, which is a new book by Douglas Murray,
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:17.640]  even if they stopped all Islamic immigration coming into Europe now, and there was never anymore, even if they stopped it all,
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:23.640]  demographically, they would still be the majority within, in certain countries, within our lifetimes.
[03:27:23.640 --> 03:27:25.640]  That's with even stopping.
[03:27:25.640 --> 03:27:31.640]  That's right. As you see the EU vice president say, just get used to it, we're getting rid of all the European countries.
[03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:35.640]  Yeah, I mean, they get up in front of parliament and say Germans will be a minority and that's a good thing.
[03:27:35.640 --> 03:27:38.640]  You will die out and that's a good thing and we'll celebrate it.
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:45.640]  But it's going to happen. Sweden, ethnic Swedes will be a minority within our lifetimes in Sweden.
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:48.640]  I'm not just talking about capital cities. I'm talking about the entire country.
[03:27:48.640 --> 03:27:51.640]  Ethnic Swedes will be a minority.
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:54.640]  And of course, it was at National Geographic celebrated it.
[03:27:54.640 --> 03:28:00.640]  The New Europeans is a bunch of blobs in hijabs and Muslim men.
[03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:03.640]  That's the New Europeans. Great. That's something to look forward to.
[03:28:03.640 --> 03:28:10.640]  And again, it's all based on this premise of eroding Western civilization, of making that bad.
[03:28:10.640 --> 03:28:17.640]  Like we've got something to be ashamed of when the entire history of the world is about warring tribes, is about slavery.
[03:28:17.640 --> 03:28:21.640]  Every single major power in the world was involved in slavery.
[03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:23.640]  Many were involved in colonialism.
[03:28:23.640 --> 03:28:25.640]  We were the first to stop slavery.
[03:28:25.640 --> 03:28:32.640]  I mean, even Robert Lee, this Confederate general that they're all, you know, having tantrums about and pulling down statues,
[03:28:32.640 --> 03:28:37.640]  he wrote that slavery was evil. He freed slaves on his own plantation.
[03:28:37.640 --> 03:28:43.640]  So the very worst example, the very worst guy they hold up, even he was anti-slavery.
[03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:49.640]  And since the founding of the country when his father was a top general in Washington, they were trying to figure out a way to end it.
[03:28:49.640 --> 03:28:53.640]  Yeah. I mean, I've got a whole video about that coming out.
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:28:54.640]  This is his quote.
[03:28:54.640 --> 03:29:04.640]  In this enlightened age, there are few, I believe, but what we'll acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil in any country.
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:09.640]  That was Confederate general Robert Lee who wrote that in a letter to his wife.
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:15.640]  And of course, even if he was the head of the Northern Army, Paul, he was the head of West Point, he didn't want to do it.
[03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:18.640]  It was all a big manipulation. You're going to take over.
[03:29:18.640 --> 03:29:25.640]  And for the time I popped in, though, we skipped a break, so Paul's good. We're going to come right back on the other side of this break with Paul Watson,
[03:29:25.640 --> 03:29:28.640]  hosting from her Britannic Majesties in London, England.
[03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:32.640]  This is key intel. The enemy does not want you to hear this because they don't want human success.
[03:29:32.640 --> 03:29:48.640]  We're going to be victorious newswars.com.
[03:29:48.640 --> 03:29:55.640]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called Stingrays,
[03:29:55.640 --> 03:30:02.640]  which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[03:30:02.640 --> 03:30:11.640]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements,
[03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:15.640]  forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[03:30:15.640 --> 03:30:19.640]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment,
[03:30:19.640 --> 03:30:26.640]  and they have no legal authority for warrantless Stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information
[03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:31.640]  on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:36.640]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming. It's already here.
[03:30:36.640 --> 03:30:47.640]  This is Darren McBreen, and I invite you to join the resistance. Infowars.com.
[03:30:47.640 --> 03:30:51.640]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide,
[03:30:51.640 --> 03:30:56.640]  while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:30:56.640 --> 03:31:01.640]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[03:31:01.640 --> 03:31:05.640]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:05.640 --> 03:31:10.640]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:10.640 --> 03:31:16.640]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:31:16.640 --> 03:31:21.640]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[03:31:21.640 --> 03:31:23.640]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:23.640 --> 03:31:30.640]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:30.640 --> 03:31:35.640]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:35.640 --> 03:31:38.640]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:38.640 --> 03:31:44.640]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:44.640 --> 03:31:47.640]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:32:15.640 --> 03:32:19.640]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times
[03:32:19.640 --> 03:32:22.640]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:22.640 --> 03:32:26.640]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our general experts include
[03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:30.640]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver, and more.
[03:32:30.640 --> 03:32:34.640]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[03:32:34.640 --> 03:32:38.640]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[03:32:38.640 --> 03:32:43.640]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfowarsLife.com

[03:32:52.640 --> 03:32:56.640]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[03:32:56.640 --> 03:33:00.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:00.640 --> 03:33:04.640]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:07.640 --> 03:33:10.640]  We are live. It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:10.640 --> 03:33:13.640]  So before we go to our guests, I just want to mention in this hour,
[03:33:13.640 --> 03:33:15.640]  we have a limited-time flash special.
[03:33:15.640 --> 03:33:20.640]  Get Super Male Vitality for 57% off at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:33:20.640 --> 03:33:22.640]  That is a special that's still ongoing.

[03:33:27.640 --> 03:33:29.640]  We're under constant attack.
[03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:33.640]  We've managed to sustain ourselves and thrive through you getting the products.
[03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:37.640]  We're not dependent on outside advertisers that can be targeted with boycotts
[03:33:37.640 --> 03:33:41.640]  by intolerant hysterical leftists, which is why we've been able to prosper
[03:33:41.640 --> 03:33:43.640]  and are outside of their remit.
[03:33:43.640 --> 03:33:46.640]  But only if you continue to support us by getting the products.
[03:33:46.640 --> 03:33:49.640]  We also have EmRick's Essentials line of organic household products.
[03:33:49.640 --> 03:33:53.640]  The Oxide Sunscreen, the Herbal Bug Spray, the Mouthwash, the Bodywash.

[03:34:07.640 --> 03:34:09.640]  Right, let's go to our guest.
[03:34:09.640 --> 03:34:13.640]  He is, and this is a tough pronunciation, but I'm going to attempt it,
[03:34:13.640 --> 03:34:17.640]  Stix Hexenhammer 666 on YouTube.
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:21.640]  He is, by my estimation, one of the smartest commentators on YouTube
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:24.640]  on such a wide variety of topics.
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:27.640]  He's otherwise known as Carl Warwick.
[03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:29.640]  Again, another easy pronunciation.
[03:34:29.640 --> 03:34:31.640]  But Carl, welcome to the show.
[03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:33.640]  Thank you for having me.
[03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:36.640]  Good to have you here. I'm a big fan of your videos.
[03:34:36.640 --> 03:34:40.640]  Now, I want to get into the technical details of what's happening over at YouTube
[03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:43.640]  with the new censorship program, the whole limited state thing.
[03:34:43.640 --> 03:34:46.640]  But first, I want to get into the overarching agenda.
[03:34:46.640 --> 03:34:51.640]  We had Julian Assange, no less, earlier today, tweet this.
[03:34:51.640 --> 03:34:52.640]  I'm going to read it.
[03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:55.640]  This is where young men, not on the left, are now getting their social
[03:34:55.640 --> 03:34:57.640]  or political education.
[03:34:57.640 --> 03:34:59.640]  This includes people like at Prison Planet.
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:01.640]  He also mentioned you, of course.
[03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:04.640]  He's talking about people going to YouTube,
[03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:09.640]  people getting their commentary, their information from video content,
[03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:12.640]  not necessarily from written content.
[03:35:12.640 --> 03:35:17.640]  He went on to say, while the US left still has its anti-war heavy hitters,
[03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:21.640]  the new vibrant English-speaking organic culture is oral
[03:35:21.640 --> 03:35:25.640]  and emerges from self-made videos on YouTube and forums.
[03:35:25.640 --> 03:35:28.640]  That was Julian Assange in a tweet earlier today.
[03:35:28.640 --> 03:35:33.640]  Carl, I joked a few months ago that YouTube was becoming a right-wing safe space
[03:35:33.640 --> 03:35:36.640]  because the left just can't compete on there.
[03:35:36.640 --> 03:35:37.640]  You've made videos about that.
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:39.640]  In the past, they get downvoted.
[03:35:39.640 --> 03:35:43.640]  Their videos either get no traction or they get completely trashed.
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:47.640]  Of course, it's far easier to spit out a virtue signaling tweet
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:52.640]  than to actually take the time to script, dictate, and edit a 10-minute YouTube video.
[03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:56.640]  So the question is, how much of this censorship when it comes to YouTube
[03:35:56.640 --> 03:36:00.640]  is down to Google compensating for the left laziness
[03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:03.640]  and their failure to resonate with an audience,
[03:36:03.640 --> 03:36:07.640]  particularly a younger audience on YouTube.
[03:36:07.640 --> 03:36:10.640]  I think a lot of it is down to laziness
[03:36:10.640 --> 03:36:13.640]  because it's a lot easier to virtue signal on Twitter
[03:36:13.640 --> 03:36:16.640]  than to actually sit down and craft a YouTube video
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:18.640]  that's going to resonate with people.
[03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:22.640]  I think a lot of it is really on the fiscal side
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:25.640]  as far as Google itself is concerned.
[03:36:25.640 --> 03:36:29.640]  I think they're legitimately worried about advertisers going elsewhere,
[03:36:29.640 --> 03:36:33.640]  but the thing is they're not going to be able to get any of those advertisers back
[03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:35.640]  just by pretending to be moral.
[03:36:35.640 --> 03:36:37.640]  Everyone knows that ultimately it's about the money.
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:39.640]  If they didn't have a problem with the ad companies,
[03:36:39.640 --> 03:36:41.640]  they probably wouldn't censor anything.
[03:36:41.640 --> 03:36:42.640]  They probably wouldn't care.
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:45.640]  They'd put anything on YouTube and allow it to be there
[03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:48.640]  so long as it was making them a paycheck.
[03:36:48.640 --> 03:36:50.640]  Insofar as that's concerned,
[03:36:50.640 --> 03:36:54.640]  I don't think it's really pressure from the left so much as on a fiscal level.
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:36:57.640]  The pressure from the left appears to be brought to bear.
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:00.640]  They're going after domain registrars now.
[03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:03.640]  It's not just Google or any Google service.
[03:37:03.640 --> 03:37:05.640]  They've gone after GAB most recently.
[03:37:05.640 --> 03:37:08.640]  They've gone after other sites as well.
[03:37:08.640 --> 03:37:10.640]  Ad firms themselves.
[03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:14.640]  I think what happens is that some group of authoritarian leftists
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:16.640]  that don't want anyone to have a good time,
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:18.640]  they don't have good ideas, they're like,
[03:37:18.640 --> 03:37:20.640]  oh, we can't compete with anybody.
[03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:22.640]  We need to lean on the advertisers.
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:25.640]  So they use the advertisers, I think, as a form of middleman.
[03:37:25.640 --> 03:37:29.640]  And Google has to be aware of this going on.
[03:37:29.640 --> 03:37:31.640]  They have to know that it's going on.
[03:37:31.640 --> 03:37:34.640]  But they're kind of stymied in their ability to respond
[03:37:34.640 --> 03:37:38.640]  because they're like, well, we don't want to lose even more money, I suppose.
[03:37:38.640 --> 03:37:40.640]  Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it?
[03:37:40.640 --> 03:37:44.640]  I just don't see that many successful left-wing commentators on YouTube
[03:37:44.640 --> 03:37:47.640]  because they still have a huge traffic on the late night comedy shows.
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:50.640]  But in terms of independent content creators,
[03:37:50.640 --> 03:37:52.640]  they're just pathetic.
[03:37:52.640 --> 03:37:54.640]  They get owned every single time.
[03:37:54.640 --> 03:37:56.640]  And I think that's part of it.
[03:37:56.640 --> 03:37:59.640]  Even like Vice and New York Times came out a couple of months ago
[03:37:59.640 --> 03:38:01.640]  and basically said, yeah, I was right.
[03:38:01.640 --> 03:38:05.640]  The right or libertarians or whoever are completely dominating YouTube.
[03:38:05.640 --> 03:38:09.640]  So I think it is a part of the motivation behind wanting to censor it.
[03:38:09.640 --> 03:38:11.640]  Just getting into the technical details.
[03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:14.640]  Of course, we had this announcement from Google last week.
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:17.640]  I believe they would censor offensive or controversial content,
[03:38:17.640 --> 03:38:19.640]  which of course is totally subjective.
[03:38:19.640 --> 03:38:21.640]  They introduced this limited state.
[03:38:21.640 --> 03:38:23.640]  Just explain what limited state means
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:27.640]  and what kind of videos are being censored right now.
[03:38:27.640 --> 03:38:30.640]  Yeah, as far as I can tell from the list of limited state videos,
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:35.640]  90% of them are things that technically do breach the TOS.
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:37.640]  So I'm not even sure why they're retaining it on the platform.
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:40.640]  But then you've got the problematic group,
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:44.640]  which is stuff that doesn't violate the TOS while why is it in limited state?
[03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:45.640]  It should just be there.
[03:38:45.640 --> 03:38:46.640]  If they're worried about it,
[03:38:46.640 --> 03:38:49.640]  then there should be a public debate over the actual content.
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:56.640]  I don't even think to your mention of like the left online.
[03:38:56.640 --> 03:39:00.640]  There are people on the actual left as opposed to Hillary Clinton,
[03:39:00.640 --> 03:39:04.640]  neoliberal or something that have made it.
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:05.640]  They're going to get censored too
[03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:10.640]  because they actually respond to some of the so-called offensive content too.
[03:39:10.640 --> 03:39:13.640]  They're just oblivious to this fact for the most part.
[03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:17.640]  But what it is, limited state is all about trying to hide things away
[03:39:17.640 --> 03:39:18.640]  and it simply won't work.
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:20.640]  It's already not worked.
[03:39:20.640 --> 03:39:26.640]  Some of these users posted stats on the videos that they had moved to limited state.
[03:39:26.640 --> 03:39:31.640]  Some of it was Black Pigeon Speaks, not against TOS, not even really out there.
[03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:34.640]  I think one of the videos was kind out there, the other two, not really.
[03:39:34.640 --> 03:39:35.640]  They were pretty mundane.
[03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:38.640]  Swan of Tulena, I believe, and others.
[03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:41.640]  And when the content gets censored like that,
[03:39:41.640 --> 03:39:43.640]  somebody slaps it on a list somewhere.
[03:39:43.640 --> 03:39:45.640]  And other people think, wow, well, it must be cool
[03:39:45.640 --> 03:39:47.640]  because it's been put in limited state.
[03:39:47.640 --> 03:39:50.640]  The Streisand effect kicks in all of a sudden
[03:39:50.640 --> 03:39:53.640]  a hundred times more people are watching it.
[03:39:53.640 --> 03:39:55.640]  They simply can't interact with it on YouTube.
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:40:00.640]  And I think it's YouTube's plausible deniability at play there
[03:40:00.640 --> 03:40:04.640]  where they don't really care per se if the material is there,
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:06.640]  but they're trying to appease those same leftists.
[03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:08.640]  And so they're like, oh, well, it's good.
[03:40:08.640 --> 03:40:10.640]  Yeah, it'll spread around far further.
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:12.640]  We don't really care, though, because all these NGOs
[03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:14.640]  that we're working with, they'll be appeased.
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:17.640]  People just spread it around off of Google services.
[03:40:17.640 --> 03:40:19.640]  So it's all good, I guess.
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:22.640]  Yeah, it was interesting because I think one of those videos,
[03:40:22.640 --> 03:40:25.640]  and I didn't wash it all, but it was basically a woman
[03:40:25.640 --> 03:40:27.640]  in her living room from Finland or somewhere
[03:40:27.640 --> 03:40:29.640]  talking about the migrant crisis.
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:31.640]  That was one of them that was limited to say.
[03:40:31.640 --> 03:40:34.640]  This is like, oh, this is the most shocking, controversial thing.
[03:40:34.640 --> 03:40:37.640]  Literally some woman sat in front of a webcam talking about things.
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:41.640]  But like you said, it gives them that strides and effect.
[03:40:41.640 --> 03:40:42.640]  It makes it illicit.
[03:40:42.640 --> 03:40:44.640]  It gives it this illicit cache.
[03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:47.640]  I thought they would deal with that by just banning a whole range of things.
[03:40:47.640 --> 03:40:50.640]  But as of this moment, it seems to be quite limited.
[03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:53.640]  The actual number of videos that they've censored in that way.
[03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:56.640]  So maybe it's just a token measure.
[03:40:56.640 --> 03:41:00.640]  I wanted to move on, though, because we're short on time.
[03:41:00.640 --> 03:41:04.640]  The whole moral panic over white supremacism, fascism.
[03:41:04.640 --> 03:41:07.640]  We had Calgary police. I saw you talking about this the other day.
[03:41:07.640 --> 03:41:11.640]  They put out a list of potential characteristics for parents
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:14.640]  whose children might be prone to joining racist hate groups.
[03:41:14.640 --> 03:41:18.640]  One of them was literally listening to heavy metal music.
[03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:23.640]  And you made the connection, the comparison, how it's completely flipped.
[03:41:23.640 --> 03:41:25.640]  Like back in the day, it was the evangelicals.
[03:41:25.640 --> 03:41:28.640]  It was the Christian right that created this whole panic over, you know,
[03:41:28.640 --> 03:41:31.640]  satanic messages embedded in rock music.
[03:41:31.640 --> 03:41:34.640]  So it seems to have completely flipped where the so-called progressives
[03:41:34.640 --> 03:41:36.640]  are now the puritans, right?
[03:41:36.640 --> 03:41:38.640]  Exactly.
[03:41:38.640 --> 03:41:41.640]  I expect them to start burning albums or something like that,
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:43.640]  or literally burning books.
[03:41:43.640 --> 03:41:47.640]  Like, you know, ten years ago, we're talking about good pious,
[03:41:47.640 --> 03:41:50.640]  generally right-leaning, at least, Christian individuals.
[03:41:50.640 --> 03:41:53.640]  They're like, Harry Potter doesn't belong in the library.
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:55.640]  Harry Potter doesn't belong, you know, Lord of the Rings
[03:41:55.640 --> 03:41:57.640]  or something doesn't belong in the school.
[03:41:57.640 --> 03:41:59.640]  Why is it there? It's offensive to us.
[03:41:59.640 --> 03:42:01.640]  So we must suppress it because it's offensive.
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:03.640]  It's the same thing that they're saying now.
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:05.640]  It's just different people saying it.
[03:42:05.640 --> 03:42:10.640]  But I think part of it is those, some millennials,
[03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:15.640]  not all, like I'm a millennial myself, but some, or I should say many,
[03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:19.640]  they've done what the people who stood against the reigning culture
[03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:23.640]  in maybe the 80s did, which is they got older, they got more boring,
[03:42:23.640 --> 03:42:25.640]  and now they're moralistic.
[03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:28.640]  But they've been imprinted on differently from past generations.
[03:42:28.640 --> 03:42:31.640]  Back then it was, you listened to Iron Maid Minazi.
[03:42:31.640 --> 03:42:33.640]  You must be a Satanist. You must be worshiping the devil.
[03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:37.640]  We got to look out about you, probably put you through therapy.
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:40.640]  Certainly shouldn't let you speak freely because it's so offensive
[03:42:40.640 --> 03:42:42.640]  and it'll cause crime and all these things.
[03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:45.640]  Now they say the same thing, the Calgary police, as you pointed out,
[03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:49.640]  they come out and they say, loud, angry rock music makes you a Nazi.
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:52.640]  So if they're listening to literal anarcho-punk,
[03:42:52.640 --> 03:42:57.640]  something that communists would listen to, that also makes them a Nazi.
[03:42:57.640 --> 03:43:01.640]  And I think the average person, if they saw it phrased differently,
[03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:04.640]  if they're getting this report from the old guard legacy media,
[03:43:04.640 --> 03:43:06.640]  they might just gobble it down.
[03:43:06.640 --> 03:43:10.640]  But if they hear somebody online, and this is, I think, what they're worried about,
[03:43:10.640 --> 03:43:13.640]  satirizing the fact that it's so dumb, then they say,
[03:43:13.640 --> 03:43:15.640]  oh yeah, of course it's dumb.
[03:43:15.640 --> 03:43:16.640]  That doesn't make any sense.
[03:43:16.640 --> 03:43:21.640]  You know, they were listening to like Iron Butterfly or something like that.
[03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:24.640]  And it all comes back to, again, identity politics.
[03:43:24.640 --> 03:43:29.640]  It's moral hysteria. Salon.com had a headline a couple of days ago.
[03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:31.640]  Time to give up on identity politics.
[03:43:31.640 --> 03:43:33.640]  It's dragging the progressive agenda down.
[03:43:33.640 --> 03:43:38.640]  MSNBC this morning was talking about how the identity politics thing
[03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:40.640]  just doesn't work electorally for Democrats.
[03:43:40.640 --> 03:43:42.640]  Why are they still doubling down on it?
[03:43:42.640 --> 03:43:46.640]  But of course the top comment, Carl, on this Salon.com article,
[03:43:46.640 --> 03:43:51.640]  was somebody whinging about how the writer of this article saying identity politics
[03:43:51.640 --> 03:43:56.640]  no longer works for the left is just expressing their white privilege.
[03:43:56.640 --> 03:44:00.640]  So I don't, I mean, I see a few chinks of light where they actually know
[03:44:00.640 --> 03:44:02.640]  what we're doing here. This is not working.
[03:44:02.640 --> 03:44:05.640]  But I don't see the left giving up on identity politics yet.
[03:44:05.640 --> 03:44:09.640]  It's such an enraged, enthused cult right now.
[03:44:09.640 --> 03:44:13.640]  You know, we had the mainstream media, some top celebrities come out,
[03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:18.640]  and even Andors Antifa after the whole Charlottesville thing.
[03:44:18.640 --> 03:44:20.640]  So they only seem to be doubling down on it.
[03:44:20.640 --> 03:44:25.640]  My point I've made is, and this was a point made by the University of Tennessee
[03:44:25.640 --> 03:44:29.640]  Professor Glenn Holland Reynolds, he said that this rampant craziness,
[03:44:29.640 --> 03:44:32.640]  this hysteria that's being ginned up by the establishment media,
[03:44:32.640 --> 03:44:36.640]  which results in, you know, Antifa assaults, results in riots,
[03:44:36.640 --> 03:44:39.640]  such as the riots after Trump was elected.
[03:44:39.640 --> 03:44:42.640]  That is going to cause ordinary voters, ordinary Americans,
[03:44:42.640 --> 03:44:45.640]  to clamor for right-wing authoritarianism.
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:48.640]  So the actual panic that they're engaged in about, oh my God,
[03:44:48.640 --> 03:44:50.640]  literally a fascist has taken over the White House,
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:52.640]  which is, of course, complete bonkham.
[03:44:52.640 --> 03:44:56.640]  They could actually, ironically, bring that real scenario about
[03:44:56.640 --> 03:45:00.640]  right-wing authoritarianism by their very actions.
[03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:02.640]  Do you see something like that playing out,
[03:45:02.640 --> 03:45:04.640]  or do you think it's kind of going to simmer down
[03:45:04.640 --> 03:45:09.640]  as we get further away from the whole riot and the Charlottesville thing?
[03:45:09.640 --> 03:45:13.640]  Well, I hope that it simmers down, but that wouldn't be historically the case.
[03:45:13.640 --> 03:45:16.640]  Usually what happens, we see this in the wake of the Red Scare,
[03:45:16.640 --> 03:45:18.640]  the Satanic Panic.
[03:45:18.640 --> 03:45:21.640]  Every time before, the only reason it simmers down is because
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:26.640]  whatever group was empowered to be abusive falls by the wayside.
[03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:32.640]  They become outdated, youth rebellion usually boils over, destroys them.
[03:45:32.640 --> 03:45:36.640]  And then after 10, 15 relatively calm years,
[03:45:36.640 --> 03:45:40.640]  the next generation, as it grows older, does the same thing.
[03:45:40.640 --> 03:45:42.640]  It seems to be an innate human characteristic.
[03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:46.640]  My hope is that at the very least we can safeguard,
[03:45:46.640 --> 03:45:48.640]  this is the big thing about alt-tech.
[03:45:48.640 --> 03:45:51.640]  If we just safeguard the Internet as a place to express yourself,
[03:45:51.640 --> 03:45:56.640]  so people aren't being harassed, abused, attacked, de-platformed, whatever,
[03:45:56.640 --> 03:46:01.640]  for voicing simple opinions, then it doesn't matter if we're in a moral panic.
[03:46:01.640 --> 03:46:04.640]  At the very least, people will always be able to speak freely,
[03:46:04.640 --> 03:46:09.640]  and if they can speak freely, good ideas, non-abusive ideas, hopefully,
[03:46:09.640 --> 03:46:11.640]  tend to win out over time.
[03:46:11.640 --> 03:46:15.640]  If we allow overt censorship of the main mode of human communication,
[03:46:15.640 --> 03:46:19.640]  which is the Internet now, if we allow it to become too heavily censored
[03:46:19.640 --> 03:46:24.640]  and alt-tech is suppressed, then we probably fall into another dark age,
[03:46:24.640 --> 03:46:28.640]  as it would hold back all of human development on just an economic level,
[03:46:28.640 --> 03:46:30.640]  not even just a cultural level.
[03:46:30.640 --> 03:46:33.640]  It'd be terrible, I think, for this entire world.
[03:46:33.640 --> 03:46:36.640]  And of course, the argument that I've heard many times,
[03:46:36.640 --> 03:46:38.640]  and I've made the argument, you know,
[03:46:38.640 --> 03:46:41.640]  why don't you just build your own video platform?
[03:46:41.640 --> 03:46:43.640]  Why don't you just build your own social media platform?
[03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:47.640]  The argument before was, it's pointless, it will just be an echo chamber,
[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:50.640]  you won't be reaching the masses, you'll be preaching to the choir.
[03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:53.640]  That seems to have shifted a little bit, especially, you know,
[03:46:53.640 --> 03:46:56.640]  BitShoot came out with, I think it was a tweet where they showed their traffic
[03:46:56.640 --> 03:46:59.640]  going through the roof after I just gave them a few tweets,
[03:46:59.640 --> 03:47:02.640]  you did as well, a couple of other prominent people.
[03:47:02.640 --> 03:47:06.640]  You said, I saw a video where you were saying GAB wasn't an echo chamber,
[03:47:06.640 --> 03:47:09.640]  but that's the main criticism that they get.
[03:47:09.640 --> 03:47:11.640]  The question is, is it worth it?
[03:47:11.640 --> 03:47:13.640]  Should we just stick to the big, dominant forums,
[03:47:13.640 --> 03:47:16.640]  or should we actually start moving our content over,
[03:47:16.640 --> 03:47:21.640]  at least giving, you know, BitShoot the exclusive first upload on the video,
[03:47:21.640 --> 03:47:23.640]  things like that, do you think that is worth it,
[03:47:23.640 --> 03:47:26.640]  or is that just a backup measure,
[03:47:26.640 --> 03:47:29.640]  and we should continue with these main big platforms like YouTube
[03:47:29.640 --> 03:47:33.640]  as our primary content generators?
[03:47:33.640 --> 03:47:38.640]  I think the best strategy is we stand and fight on the big sites as much as possible.
[03:47:38.640 --> 03:47:40.640]  Hopefully things get better.
[03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:43.640]  Hopefully the long-term human trend is bucked.
[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:44.640]  No more problem.
[03:47:44.640 --> 03:47:46.640]  Altmedia is still there.
[03:47:46.640 --> 03:47:48.640]  That will have its own audience.
[03:47:48.640 --> 03:47:52.640]  But like I've been putting my content on VidMe, I do exclusives there,
[03:47:52.640 --> 03:47:55.640]  I put it on BitShoot, I'm on Mines, I'm on GAB,
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:47:57.640]  I'm on Twitter, I'm on everywhere.
[03:47:57.640 --> 03:47:59.640]  I've got two blogs for just my books,
[03:47:59.640 --> 03:48:02.640]  because I could no longer just rely on BlogSpot,
[03:48:02.640 --> 03:48:04.640]  because I said, well, some people are being,
[03:48:04.640 --> 03:48:06.640]  if you look at Jordan Peterson,
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:10.640]  he gets kicked off even Gmail for something posted on YouTube.
[03:48:10.640 --> 03:48:12.640]  So how am I supposed to trust BlogSpot?
[03:48:12.640 --> 03:48:14.640]  It has nothing to do with my political discourse,
[03:48:14.640 --> 03:48:16.640]  it's just where I sell books.
[03:48:16.640 --> 03:48:22.640]  But we should definitely try to maintain sites that have already been built.
[03:48:22.640 --> 03:48:24.640]  I'm not saying we should flee anything,
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:27.640]  because that's just the worst possible decision to make,
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:30.640]  because then that turns into an echo chamber too.
[03:48:30.640 --> 03:48:34.640]  It would be used for attacks on Altmedia, it would be freakish.
[03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:37.640]  But these new sites that are cropping up, they are growing,
[03:48:37.640 --> 03:48:40.640]  they're already not echo chambers, they're already entertaining,
[03:48:40.640 --> 03:48:41.640]  so why not use them?
[03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:44.640]  As far as a site like Facebook, it's already not entertaining.
[03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:46.640]  Facebook is worthless now.
[03:48:46.640 --> 03:48:49.640]  YouTube's entertaining, Twitter can be entertaining,
[03:48:49.640 --> 03:48:51.640]  Facebook's the odd man out.
[03:48:51.640 --> 03:48:53.640]  Why even bother using it?
[03:48:53.640 --> 03:48:56.640]  I wouldn't even use it at all if there weren't a couple of people
[03:48:56.640 --> 03:48:59.640]  I know in real life that I even talked to there.
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:03.640]  Now I just want to get your take quickly on this new announcement today.
[03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:04.640]  Very it.
[03:49:04.640 --> 03:49:07.640]  This is the big Hillary Clinton backed new platform.
[03:49:07.640 --> 03:49:10.640]  Media for the 65.8 million.
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:14.640]  I tweeted media for everyone who has the same opinion about everything.
[03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:18.640]  I went on this site, it's confusing and bizarre.
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:21.640]  It seems like it's not aesthetically pleasing.
[03:49:21.640 --> 03:49:22.640]  What is the point of this?
[03:49:22.640 --> 03:49:24.640]  It's very strange.
[03:49:24.640 --> 03:49:28.640]  It's Greek to me, I guess it's to take vetted information,
[03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:32.640]  put it in vaguely meme-like form and spit it out.
[03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:36.640]  But I was on there, they already had one bad-mouthing Bernie Sanders
[03:49:36.640 --> 03:49:38.640]  and they choose just the wrong day to do this.
[03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:40.640]  This is why I think their site's doomed.
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:44.640]  On the same exact day, we get that quip from Hillary Clinton's own book.
[03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:48.640]  Oh yeah, basically Bernie Sanders cost me the election.
[03:49:48.640 --> 03:49:49.640]  He hobbled me permanently.
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:51.640]  He's such a terrible person.
[03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:52.640]  I'm proud to be a Democrat.
[03:49:52.640 --> 03:49:55.640]  I wish that Bernie was, is the exact line from there.
[03:49:55.640 --> 03:50:00.640]  How moronic can her strategy possibly be to think that that's a good idea?
[03:50:00.640 --> 03:50:05.640]  She's trying to ingratiate herself to the same neoliberals, the pro-war,
[03:50:05.640 --> 03:50:10.640]  not really fiscally far-left types that are just social-authoritarians.
[03:50:10.640 --> 03:50:13.640]  They're trying to maintain power and all they can do,
[03:50:13.640 --> 03:50:15.640]  they don't even want to attack Trump half the time.
[03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:19.640]  They'd rather attack Bernie Sanders as long as Hillary Clinton wants to do it.
[03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:22.640]  So I think she's probably going to take advantage of this site.
[03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:25.640]  A lot of people will be alienated and it'll just, it'll end up,
[03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:27.640]  not even just a left-wing echo chamber,
[03:50:27.640 --> 03:50:30.640]  but specifically a pro-Clinton echo chamber.
[03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:35.640]  And people will, they'll slowly gravitate out as they realize Clinton's not going to run again.
[03:50:35.640 --> 03:50:37.640]  I don't think she will.
[03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:43.640]  All right, we're going to come back in the final segment with Carl Warwick to talk about his YouTube channel.
[03:50:43.640 --> 03:50:44.640]  I was skipping the break.
[03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:45.640]  Okay, that's great.
[03:50:45.640 --> 03:50:47.640]  Carl, just with the final outro here,
[03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:50.640]  I wanted to ask you about your kind of approach to this,
[03:50:50.640 --> 03:50:54.640]  because you seem to make so many videos about so many different topics.
[03:50:54.640 --> 03:50:57.640]  You seem to have such an extensive knowledge about everything.
[03:50:57.640 --> 03:50:58.640]  It's damn annoying, actually.
[03:50:58.640 --> 03:51:03.640]  But I just wanted to get a sense of, you know, how do you approach different topics?
[03:51:03.640 --> 03:51:05.640]  Do you do a massive amount of reading?
[03:51:05.640 --> 03:51:10.640]  I mean, what are your sources for information, essentially?
[03:51:10.640 --> 03:51:12.640]  Essentially, what I try to do,
[03:51:12.640 --> 03:51:16.640]  I try to keep up to date on everything that's happening in the world to the best of my ability.
[03:51:16.640 --> 03:51:19.640]  And there are some fairly good sites.
[03:51:19.640 --> 03:51:23.640]  It's sort of hit or miss, because you can't rely upon the old guard.
[03:51:23.640 --> 03:51:25.640]  You can't go to CNN or Fox or anything like that.
[03:51:25.640 --> 03:51:27.640]  I don't watch TV.
[03:51:27.640 --> 03:51:29.640]  You can use their websites as a springboard, I guess.
[03:51:29.640 --> 03:51:31.640]  But why would you even want to give them views?
[03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:33.640]  I'll archive it if I share their links out.
[03:51:33.640 --> 03:51:39.640]  I prefer using 4chan, honestly, above anything else as a news aggregator at this point,
[03:51:39.640 --> 03:51:44.640]  because it's simply, again, it's not the echo chamber some people believe that it is.
[03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:46.640]  And so you're getting all sorts of stuff.
[03:51:46.640 --> 03:51:51.640]  You can get local news an hour before it's broken by the lame stream sort of press.
[03:51:51.640 --> 03:51:54.640]  So I try to keep up to date on all of that.
[03:51:54.640 --> 03:51:57.640]  I like to read a lot when I can, when I have time.
[03:51:57.640 --> 03:52:00.640]  And I just have a lot of interests, basically.
[03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:02.640]  That's basically what it's about.
[03:52:02.640 --> 03:52:07.640]  And I'm pledged to trying, insofar as I'm able to,
[03:52:07.640 --> 03:52:10.640]  to break the stranglehold of the legacy media,
[03:52:10.640 --> 03:52:13.640]  because they've lied to me since I was a little kid.
[03:52:13.640 --> 03:52:17.640]  They lied to me with Iraq, they lied to me with Afghanistan.
[03:52:17.640 --> 03:52:22.640]  They personally lied to me about basically everything I used to think was reality.
[03:52:22.640 --> 03:52:24.640]  And that honestly makes me mad.
[03:52:24.640 --> 03:52:27.640]  I don't think that I'm alone in that.
[03:52:27.640 --> 03:52:31.640]  No, I mean, there's huge resentment now against the likes of CNN.
[03:52:31.640 --> 03:52:35.640]  Their report has expressed bewilderment whenever there's a negative chant about them,
[03:52:35.640 --> 03:52:37.640]  whenever they go out in public.
[03:52:37.640 --> 03:52:40.640]  But Twitter, it seems, you don't get involved in the Twitter spats,
[03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:45.640]  which is something that I do. It's a massive vacuum that sucks up all your time, obviously.
[03:52:45.640 --> 03:52:50.640]  But from what I've seen, you don't tend to get too deeply involved in the back and forth on Twitter,
[03:52:50.640 --> 03:52:55.640]  I guess, because you know it's kind of a small platform, really, in the aggregate, isn't it?
[03:52:55.640 --> 03:53:00.640]  Yeah, well, Twitter was something that I never even planned on joining.
[03:53:00.640 --> 03:53:04.640]  I had originally said, I'll never have a Twitter, I'll never use any of these other sites.
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:06.640]  I was just a YouTuber.
[03:53:06.640 --> 03:53:10.640]  And then the far left decided, hey, we want more censorship,
[03:53:10.640 --> 03:53:14.640]  we want to marginalize people, manipulate all the algorithms.
[03:53:14.640 --> 03:53:18.640]  So I'm like, well, nobody's getting notifications, I need a Twitter account.
[03:53:18.640 --> 03:53:22.640]  But I try to avoid direct sort of confrontational stuff.
[03:53:22.640 --> 03:53:25.640]  I'd rather just make my own views known, put them out there.
[03:53:25.640 --> 03:53:27.640]  If somebody disagrees, that's okay.
[03:53:27.640 --> 03:53:30.640]  If they want to attack me, that's okay, too.
[03:53:30.640 --> 03:53:32.640]  I support their free speech, too.
[03:53:32.640 --> 03:53:34.640]  I don't care if they're a self-proclaimed communist.
[03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:38.640]  They can come aboard that they're never going to get banned on my channel just for insulting me.
[03:53:38.640 --> 03:53:41.640]  They would have to go after one of my other subscribers
[03:53:41.640 --> 03:53:47.640]  or post something that's blatantly illegal in order to get banned from the channel.
[03:53:47.640 --> 03:53:53.640]  All right, Carl, just in the final minute here, tell people how they can find you on Twitter and YouTube.
[03:53:53.640 --> 03:53:59.640]  I guess if you just type in sticks, it kind of pops up automatically, right, on YouTube at least.
[03:53:59.640 --> 03:54:04.640]  Yeah, so you can search for that or Sticks Hex and Hammer 666 on YouTube
[03:54:04.640 --> 03:54:09.640]  or Sticks 666 official on Twitter or on GAB, actually.
[03:54:09.640 --> 03:54:13.640]  Definitely go check out Carl's videos. Really insightful stuff.
[03:54:13.640 --> 03:54:16.640]  Carl, we'll have you back on the show soon. Thanks for joining us today.
[03:54:16.640 --> 03:54:18.640]  Thank you for having me.
[03:54:18.640 --> 03:54:22.640]  Okay, thank you. There goes Carl Warwick.
[03:54:22.640 --> 03:54:27.640]  Sticks Hex and Hammer 666, that's STYX if you search for that on YouTube.
[03:54:27.640 --> 03:54:33.640]  It will pop up. Again, amazing insight, amazing commentary on a whole manner of different subjects.
[03:54:33.640 --> 03:54:37.640]  Let's dip back into the news in these few final minutes though.
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:39.640]  I mentioned this earlier.
[03:54:39.640 --> 03:54:44.640]  Former Bush official, all Trump supporters are racist.
[03:54:44.640 --> 03:54:51.640]  Former George W. Bush Treasury official, Bruce Bartlett, has claimed that all 100%, he was very specific,
[03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:53.640]  of Trump supporters are racist.
[03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:59.640]  Now, this was a Treasury official, as I said, under the George W. Bush administration,
[03:54:59.640 --> 03:55:02.640]  also a domestic policy advisor to Ronald Reagan.
[03:55:02.640 --> 03:55:06.640]  He posted this message on his Facebook page yesterday.
[03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:09.640]  There is no longer any doubt all 100% of Trump supporters are racist.
[03:55:09.640 --> 03:55:12.640]  If you don't like it, F you.
[03:55:12.640 --> 03:55:18.640]  And then he was absolutely amazed that he had people disagreeing with him.
[03:55:18.640 --> 03:55:27.640]  He basically had a hysterical tantrum and a meltdown and went on to basically be really triggered about the fact that people don't like being called racist.
[03:55:27.640 --> 03:55:35.640]  Definitely not 63 million people, but he was still surprised that there was an actual backlash on that.
[03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:42.640]  Of course, he was mimicking almost exactly Hillary Clinton's infamous basket of deplorables quote said before the election,
[03:55:42.640 --> 03:55:49.640]  a couple of months before the election, where she basically said half of Trump's supporters were his lamaphore racist, sexist, you remember it.
[03:55:49.640 --> 03:55:56.640]  Again, this is a never Trump a guy, he gets up on Facebook, calls 63 million people racist,
[03:55:56.640 --> 03:56:02.640]  and then claims that he's the victim boo who because people were mean to him.
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:05.640]  This is like a 60 year old guy.
[03:56:05.640 --> 03:56:07.640]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:56:07.640 --> 03:56:09.640]  He tried to walk it back.
[03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:10.640]  Listen to this.
[03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:15.640]  I did not say all Trump voters are racist nor do they even imply that all Republicans are racist.
[03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:18.640]  What I said is that all Trump supporters are racist.
[03:56:18.640 --> 03:56:24.640]  That means the people who support Trump now today after all this horrible racist statements and actions, those people are racist.
[03:56:24.640 --> 03:56:33.640]  Of course, completely failed to name a single one of those quote racist statement and actions, but everyone who supports Trump is a racist.
[03:56:33.640 --> 03:56:35.640]  This is literally what they've got.
[03:56:35.640 --> 03:56:43.640]  They were here in September 2017, and everyone who disagrees with me as a racist is still all they've got.
[03:56:43.640 --> 03:56:50.640]  They were up on MSNBC Joe Scarborough today on the panel admitting that it's not working.
[03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:58.640]  Even Bernie Sanders came out probably six months ago, probably more than that, saying, look, guys, this is just not working.
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:08.640]  Calling people racist isn't an argument. It doesn't resonate with people who want to hear actual cogent, logical, thought out policy debates.
[03:57:08.640 --> 03:57:13.640]  And stuff that connects with them as ordinary working people doesn't work.
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:22.640]  It didn't work in 2016. That's why Trump won, partly because people were sick to the back teeth of having it ram down their throats.
[03:57:22.640 --> 03:57:31.640]  We've got salon.com coming out and saying time to give up on identity politics. Of course, they got completely rinsed in the comments by their own readers.
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:39.640]  The very top comment was somebody who was saying anyone who claims identity politics is a losing argument, which it is electorally.
[03:57:39.640 --> 03:57:46.640]  They're just expressing their white privilege. That was literally the top comment upvoted by 200 people.
[03:57:46.640 --> 03:57:55.640]  That's what the readership thinks. That's what the vast majority of the all left thinks, and they're going to continue to double down on this losing approach,
[03:57:55.640 --> 03:58:02.640]  this losing narrative that anyone who disagrees with them is a white supremacist, is a neo-Nazi, is a racist, fill in the blank.
[03:58:02.640 --> 03:58:13.640]  And even with the media's contrived moral panic over all this white supremacism stuff, it's still not resonating according to what the polls say with the American people.
[03:58:13.640 --> 03:58:21.640]  So good luck. Carry on. Carry on with your obsessive identity politics crap that doesn't resonate with anyone and will carry on winning.
[03:58:21.640 --> 03:58:36.640]  That's going to wrap it up for the show Breaking News at Infowars.com. Thanks for joining us.
