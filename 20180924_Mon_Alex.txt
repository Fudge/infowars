[00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:25.925]  43 days left.
[00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.347]  43 until the most historic election.
[00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:32.130]  Undoubtedly hands down in world history.
[00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.411]  It's Monday, the 24th day of September 2018.
[00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:38.114]  I'm your host Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[00:00:38.114 --> 00:00:42.017]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:49.282]  In the War Room with Owen Schroeder and Roger Stone is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:52.085]  Rod Rosenstein is on his way to the White House.
[00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:56.337]  Mainstream media says to either be fired or resign.
[00:00:56.337 --> 00:01:03.363]  Well, look, he got caught trying to overthrow the president working with others.
[00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:20.758]  And now because he's no longer useful to the deep state, they are preparing to throw him overboard because Trump has told the entire swamp that if they don't get loyal immediately to the Republic and stop the attempts for the 25th Amendment and for basically martial law in this country,
[00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:34.672]  Even Politico and even McClatchy, in fact we gave them the stack that's in the podcast room from last night, they even called it a nightmare scenario, end of the world scenario, civil emergency.
[00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:41.575]  And that's really the big takeaway, is the Democrats are enjoying their third term of Obama right now in their minds.
[00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:44.296]  They call Hillary the President, all over television.
[00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:53.921]  And they've got their bureaucrats taking orders from Hillary and Obama, and Obama is operating under executive orders that put a civil emergency in place right before he left office.
[00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:56.582]  And that's in all the documents.
[00:01:56.582 --> 00:02:00.564]  That's what's so incredible about all of this.
[00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:03.466]  And so, Mike Adams is joining us in the third hour,
[00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:14.174]  He made the point that under the Constitution, and under executive orders that are already there, that Trump could basically arrest thousands of members of the Deek State who are trying to overthrow the election.
[00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:21.617]  You see, they're the ones that have brought us to the point of civil emergency and saying they want a bigger civil emergency, that they want 25th Amendment.
[00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:22.837]  We don't want martial law.
[00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:25.178]  I don't want martial law.
[00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:30.239]  And I don't want to say I'm going to debate it with Mike, but I'm going to discuss the different angles of it.
[00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.560]  But because of the climate,
[00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:47.467]  that we are in this country and because of how dangerous things have gotten and because of the criminal elements that are operating as if Trump's illegitimate and as if they're their own government we have two parallel governments operating at the federal level and that is insanely dangerous.
[00:02:47.467 --> 00:03:00.574]  You have Obama and John Kerry following Trump around a day behind him around the world trying to derail the diplomacy and the detente and the
[00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:06.620]  ...actions of the United States because they're globalist working against this country.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:17.389]  So what does the president do at the point that they're trying to organize the FBI, the Justice Department, the CIA, to overthrow the president and go after President Trump's supporters?
[00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.895]  What do you do when you're faced with a multinational, globalist, Chinese, communist-funded group of traitors?
[00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:32.235]  What would George Washington do with all of this ongoing treason that is unfolding?
[00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:36.119]  So I don't want to escalate this into open tanks on the streets.
[00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.701]  That's the most extreme form of martial law.
[00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:41.574]  We're under a civil emergency.
[00:03:41.574 --> 00:03:43.014]  Obama declared one.
[00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:46.096]  Trump never rescinded it, and I never thought of that.
[00:03:46.096 --> 00:03:54.979]  I knew about the emergency Obama put in, and we're the first to talk about it, and it's why they want us banned, because we're pointing out real politique, how things really work, the deep state.
[00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.721]  Now it's being picked up by Hannity and Limbaugh and, you know, obviously Tucker Carlson and others, because it's true.
[00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.274]  We cover the hard subjects that others are afraid to cover.
[00:04:05.274 --> 00:04:06.515]  We hit the barbed wire.
[00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:11.658]  And we're respected for that by the President and by others.
[00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:13.239]  And we've been thanked for that.
[00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.701]  And the globalists have my phones tapped.
[00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:16.521]  The deep state.
[00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:16.981]  They know.
[00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:18.743]  That's why they want me destroyed.
[00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.324]  They know I have the will
[00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:27.006]  To stand up and tell the truth, and I have the will to cover the things that have got to be done, even if it destroys me.
[00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:30.749]  Because in the long run, that will end up saving everybody else.
[00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.471]  I'll be destroyed anyways, if they win.
[00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:34.131]  So I'm doing that.
[00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:44.060]  That's why they have their disinfo operatives and mainstream media, and the corporate system, and the people posing as patriots, constantly lying about me, demonizing me, and then Google and YouTube promote all those lies.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.132]  And then block all of our info because this is a exercise in shutting us down and then defaming us and destroying us.
[00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:53.314]  Try to undermine the president.
[00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:55.558]  I mean, that's the reality.
[00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:56.620]  That's the reality of what's happened.
[00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.776]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.

[00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:50.774]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.

[00:06:03.124 --> 00:06:05.787]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:10.931]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:32.533]  Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.434]  Trump has been enjoying his third term in office, according to the Deep State.
[00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:53.364]  They've been ignoring everything Trump tries to do, but Trump has wrested control of much of the federal apparatus away from them, and so you see the country coming back from the dead, horrifying the globalists because they know they've been suppressing us by design.
[00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:56.086]  This just broke minutes ago.
[00:06:56.086 --> 00:07:03.072]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and of course DrudgeReport.com as we speak.
[00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:09.956]  Rosenstein resigns, and we have him walking towards the White House literally just two minutes ago.
[00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:13.018]  We'll roll some of that here in just a moment.
[00:07:13.018 --> 00:07:17.581]  Rosenstein resigns after reports he considered taping Trump.
[00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:29.489]  Sources say that from Bloomberg, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the official in charge of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, has verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, according to one person familiar with the matter.
[00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:31.688]  And why are they in trouble?
[00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:44.533]  Trump has the notes, he has the documents, he has the emails, the text messages between this cabal, before he got into office, when he was the nominee, when he was president-elect, right through.
[00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:48.675]  He now has the entire spy grid apparatchik.
[00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:52.516]  And he is able to now know all the things they did.
[00:07:52.516 --> 00:07:55.898]  So they have been hoisted on their own spear.
[00:07:55.898 --> 00:07:58.139]  They've fallen into the pit of their own making.
[00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:08.993]  The resignation was delivered to Kelly late last week, but it's unclear whether Rosenstein is planning to follow through with a formal resignation.
[00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:10.034]  Ah, very deceptive.
[00:08:10.034 --> 00:08:11.454]  See how they operate?
[00:08:11.454 --> 00:08:14.395]  The person said they wanted to trick Trump into saying, fine, you're gone.
[00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:16.376]  Ah, very skillful.
[00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:17.716]  Very snake-like.
[00:08:17.716 --> 00:08:22.478]  A second person said that Rosenstein isn't expected to be in the job after Monday.
[00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:27.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, the move comes after reports that Rosenstein suggested to colleagues this year
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.581]  That he would secretly record conversations with President Donald Trump.
[00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:36.523]  Rosenstein was heading to the White House late Monday morning amid media reports that he is expected to be fired.
[00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:43.345]  And let's roll some of Fox News just minutes ago as he was walking to the White House to resign.
[00:08:43.345 --> 00:08:43.705]  Here it is.
[00:08:46.974 --> 00:08:48.915]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, what have I been saying since January 20th?
[00:09:21.023 --> 00:09:23.084]  2017, when the President was sworn in.
[00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:27.245]  And why did they get rid of our YouTube channel with billions of views, and millions of views that day?
[00:09:27.245 --> 00:09:40.910]  Because I laid out in a speech, surrounded by people after the inauguration, in the middle of the street, that the President must declassify the illegal spying on him and his campaign, and the RNC,
[00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:50.823]  And that he must remove the deep state operatives that were planning to try to sabotage his administration because they'd said they were spying on him illegally.
[00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.324]  They'd said they were going to undermine and block him.
[00:09:53.324 --> 00:10:00.846]  They said they were circulating COG plans when he was president-elect of how they were going to do it.
[00:10:00.846 --> 00:10:11.209]  And then I've studied how they've done this in other countries and how our own deep state works and I laid it out and that's why they want us off the air because we're on target.
[00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:21.600]  Not because we're fake news, but because when the globalists tune in, they go, my God, it's like this man shits in on our briefing rooms.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.941]  How does he know all this?
[00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:34.806]  Well, has the average globalist even read Tragedy and Hope by Carl Quigley, one of your top operatives, or the four books by Zbigniew Brzezinski, where he talked about world government plan?
[00:10:34.806 --> 00:10:36.787]  He's one of the top advisors.
[00:10:36.787 --> 00:10:38.528]  Or Kissinger's books?
[00:10:38.528 --> 00:10:39.629]  They say it all!
[00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:47.189]  You're the reason your world government's in trouble!
[00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.912]  You're the reason it's falling apart, not me!
[00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:57.754]  You thought you'd set up a private, dictatorial world government?
[00:10:57.754 --> 00:11:06.418]  And that you would just deny it existed and then once it went totally operational with world armies and world taxes and world courts?
[00:11:06.418 --> 00:11:11.661]  And once you tried to dissolve western borders and collapse us into the third world, which is all part of the admitted plan?
[00:11:12.944 --> 00:11:15.665]  That people would put up with that?
[00:11:15.665 --> 00:11:19.226]  I believed in humanity.
[00:11:19.226 --> 00:11:24.107]  I believed that when people learned about this, they would get upset and say no.
[00:11:24.107 --> 00:11:26.648]  Now here's the stalemate.
[00:11:26.648 --> 00:11:28.408]  Here's the deadlock.
[00:11:28.408 --> 00:11:31.129]  Here's the Mexican standoff.
[00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:34.690]  Here is the catch-22 we're in.
[00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:41.312]  These globalists with fiat banking have stolen trillions and trillions of dollars for themselves and saddled us with fake fiat debt.
[00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:47.993]  They've got unlimited wealth, but they don't have political power anymore.
[00:11:47.993 --> 00:11:49.915]  As humanity awakens.
[00:11:49.915 --> 00:11:53.077]  And so, they're doubling down with censorship.
[00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:54.919]  And with social disorder.
[00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:57.421]  And with race war, in their own admissions.
[00:11:57.421 --> 00:11:58.001]  How do we know?
[00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.024]  It's in the WikiLeaks!
[00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:02.385]  But it's in the Ph.D.
[00:12:02.385 --> 00:12:03.666]  level.
[00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:06.448]  Social science is that you guys use class warfare.
[00:12:06.448 --> 00:12:07.789]  That's classic Marxism.
[00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:10.908]  You go, mega bankers?
[00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:11.428]  Marxism?
[00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:17.313]  Yes, that's... people 170 years ago were leaving the plantations.
[00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:25.060]  So the British crown funded communism, it's all on record, as a way to get serfs to go, go back to a commune!
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.523]  They'd already been on that, that sounded like where they were supposed to go back to!
[00:12:28.523 --> 00:12:31.506]  This time the politicians will run you!
[00:12:31.506 --> 00:12:33.327]  Everyone will share everything!
[00:12:33.327 --> 00:12:35.689]  Boulderdash!
[00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:36.390]  Poppycock!
[00:12:37.947 --> 00:12:38.807]  B.S.
[00:12:38.807 --> 00:12:45.589]  Rabo Sierra.
[00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:53.411]  So, we've got Elizabeth Warren saying time to use the 25th Amendment.
[00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:57.052]  We've got Al Green, Articles of Impeachment, 25th Amendment, everything else.
[00:12:57.052 --> 00:13:03.213]  And you've even got CNN saying, remember, the 25th Amendment requires political apocalypse.
[00:13:03.213 --> 00:13:06.614]  Apocalypse.
[00:13:06.614 --> 00:13:07.294]  Now what's that mean?
[00:13:10.742 --> 00:13:16.185]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's martial law.
[00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:19.126]  That's civil emergency.
[00:13:19.126 --> 00:13:33.293]  And I've talked hundreds of times about the executive orders Obama put into place before he left office, and how it was a deep state coup, and I laid out the entire blueprint, but it wasn't until I saw Mike Adams' article that it all clicked.
[00:13:34.557 --> 00:13:37.600]  When I first talked to him about it and I saw it, I thought it was extreme.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.422]  And from a perspective, it is.
[00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:40.283]  Emergency report.
[00:13:40.283 --> 00:13:41.724]  Trump planning mass arrest.
[00:13:41.724 --> 00:13:43.486]  Military tribunals for deep state traitors.
[00:13:43.486 --> 00:13:44.627]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:13:44.627 --> 00:13:45.268]  It's gone viral.
[00:13:45.268 --> 00:13:49.252]  Get it out there, buddy.
[00:13:49.252 --> 00:13:52.916]  But it's because they've already said they're going to counterman the president.
[00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:54.537]  They're already ignoring his orders.
[00:13:54.537 --> 00:13:55.719]  That is martial law.
[00:13:55.719 --> 00:13:57.581]  When regular rule of law is suspended,
[00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:01.314]  Even by the Congress and the President, it's martial law.
[00:14:01.314 --> 00:14:12.743]  What about when it's the deep state, rogue groups in the CIA and the Justice Department trying to normalize it on television, saying we're ignoring him, we're doing what we want, we're the resistance?
[00:14:12.743 --> 00:14:13.524]  What is that?
[00:14:13.524 --> 00:14:23.953]  That is martial law by a rogue group in the government, not even martial law during a meteor strike, or a super volcano, or a category 9.2 earthquake.
[00:14:26.786 --> 00:14:29.407]  And there's civil unrest, you declare martial law in those areas.
[00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:32.168]  This is political, bureaucratic martial law.
[00:14:32.168 --> 00:14:37.751]  And what did Lindsey Graham on Fox News and CNN, Sunday night, call it, we're going to play that clip coming up.
[00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:52.937]  He said, we have a political, bureaucratic coup, countermanding the rule of law, ruling over much of the federal government in the country, outside of law.
[00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:56.298]  That's a quote.
[00:14:56.298 --> 00:15:02.420]  That's martial law.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:12.924]  These crazy people put us into a parallel martial law system and Obama is a mile from the White House running his own operation.
[00:15:12.924 --> 00:15:19.647]  They've got big tech taking all the orders to ban everybody from James Woods to Alex Jones.
[00:15:19.647 --> 00:15:22.008]  That's right, James Woods just got suspended.
[00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:22.468]  It's on!
[00:15:26.317 --> 00:15:36.393]  And I have specifically had the White House and the President thank me recently for the fact that I'm covering the hard topics no one else will to hit the bar bar.
[00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:39.318]  So to all the disinfo operatives and people out there that claim I'm...
[00:15:40.484 --> 00:15:42.066]  Somehow not with the President and all that.
[00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:46.152]  You see that disinfo pushed by YouTube and the big media.
[00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:47.974]  Everything else we say is shadow banned.
[00:15:47.974 --> 00:15:50.638]  It's because they don't want you to hear what the President wants you to hear.
[00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:52.841]  The President's been on my show.
[00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:54.082]  I talk to the President.
[00:15:54.082 --> 00:15:55.364]  I'm a real person.
[00:15:55.364 --> 00:15:57.126]  I'm not some anonymous person.
[00:15:57.126 --> 00:15:57.928]  You understand?
[00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:03.170]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:08.172]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:31.100]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.849]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.611]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:16.882]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:26.826]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:37.370]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:37.810]  X2.
[00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:06.359]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying.
[00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:09.440]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.440]  And so I've broken my contract.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.541]  And right now, we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:21.662]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:22.983]  Like I dream of Jeannie in this.
[00:19:22.983 --> 00:19:23.823]  It's purple gas.
[00:19:23.823 --> 00:19:27.143]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:29.124]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:32.546]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.227]  Ordered it six months ago.
[00:19:34.227 --> 00:19:36.929]  So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:38.150]  I'm breaking the contract.
[00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.071]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[00:19:40.071 --> 00:19:42.412]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[00:19:42.412 --> 00:19:46.155]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:49.297]  And we've got a good supply of it, but it'll be gone in a couple months.
[00:19:49.297 --> 00:19:52.219]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.
[00:19:52.219 --> 00:19:54.040]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.441]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:56.782]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[00:19:56.782 --> 00:19:58.163]  InfoWarshore.com.
[00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:59.544]  It's 25% off right now.
[00:20:03.757 --> 00:20:12.259]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:31.384]  While you were sleeping They came and took it all away The lanes and the meadows The places where
[00:20:43.795 --> 00:20:47.877]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, worldwide.
[00:20:47.877 --> 00:20:50.738]  Broadcasting on hundreds of TV stations, radio stations across the country.
[00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:56.870]  And at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com with our own audio and video feeds.
[00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.572]  But everywhere else we are being blocked.
[00:20:58.572 --> 00:21:01.736]  We are being completely banned, not just shadow banned.
[00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:03.979]  And now it's happening to James Woods.
[00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:08.686]  Now it's happening to every other prominent person you can imagine, only 43 days out from the election.
[00:21:08.686 --> 00:21:10.909]  The good news is Trump
[00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:18.850]  Pressuring Rosenstein to resign, because now Bloomberg's usually pretty accurate, even though they're globalists.
[00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:19.710]  They're business news.
[00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:26.716]  I found them to be a lot more accurate than, you know, kind of your mainstream ABC or CBS or NBC or CNN.
[00:21:26.716 --> 00:21:30.219]  And they're saying that he has already resigned verbally.
[00:21:30.219 --> 00:21:34.802]  But of course, they were trying to trick the president into announcing it early so he could then deny it.
[00:21:34.802 --> 00:21:37.024]  It's total rat-like behavior.
[00:21:37.024 --> 00:21:41.287]  And Trump has the Trump cards, pun intended,
[00:21:42.486 --> 00:21:49.729]  In that he has McCabe, he has Comey, he has all their text messages.
[00:21:49.729 --> 00:21:53.591]  These people are very, very arrogant.
[00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:59.053]  But now they're saying he expects to be fired.
[00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:06.737]  With that disgusting, again, possum-like smirk that he has that's so unbelievable.
[00:22:08.069 --> 00:22:25.345]  Remember, he changed the succession in the Justice Department from the Deputy Attorney General to the Inspector General, the watchdog, to just low-level political operatives of the Bushes and the Clintons.
[00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:27.467]  He is an arrogant little monster.
[00:22:28.766 --> 00:22:35.348]  And then they used the corporate media to bludgeon the president over the head to say, how dare you never remove him, never remove Mueller.
[00:22:35.348 --> 00:22:37.229]  Let him do giant fishing expeditions.
[00:22:37.229 --> 00:22:39.650]  Let him go after people's taxes 15 years ago.
[00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.751]  Let him go after girlfriends that you gave money to 15 years ago.
[00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:47.812]  Nothing to do with Russia.
[00:22:47.812 --> 00:22:49.373]  Let us raid your lawyers.
[00:22:49.373 --> 00:22:52.954]  Meanwhile, Hillary committed crimes that are mind boggling.
[00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:55.035]  This is the arrogant mental illness
[00:22:56.334 --> 00:23:07.479]  Of the Clinton-Bush dynasty and their little stay-behind operatives that they left behind inside the government via Obama's executive orders, believing that they were actually still in charge.
[00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:21.785]  So they all walked around cockily and they went on TV, Brennan and all the rest of them, and said, we're still in charge, the government's not going to do what this guy says, the government's going to kill the president, seven ways to Sunday to take him down, we're in charge.
[00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:25.147]  But the arrogance is now evaporating.
[00:23:25.147 --> 00:23:25.647]  But remember,
[00:23:27.353 --> 00:23:29.676]  Six presidents have been shot.
[00:23:29.676 --> 00:23:30.457]  I'm going from memory.
[00:23:30.457 --> 00:23:31.098]  We can look that up.
[00:23:31.098 --> 00:23:32.580]  How many presidents have been shot?
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.282]  Six.
[00:23:34.282 --> 00:23:36.245]  Six presidents have been shot.
[00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:37.627]  How many have been assassinated?
[00:23:37.627 --> 00:23:37.907]  Three?
[00:23:37.907 --> 00:23:41.892]  I'm going from memory.
[00:23:41.892 --> 00:23:43.895]  Woodrow Wilson probably got poisoned, but he'd be a fourth.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:51.325]  There have been 30 attempts to kill an incumbent or former president or a president-elect have been made since the 1800s.
[00:23:51.325 --> 00:23:53.567]  Four sitting presidents have been killed.
[00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:54.688]  All of them by gunshot.
[00:23:54.688 --> 00:23:57.950]  Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy.
[00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:58.811]  So that's four.
[00:23:58.811 --> 00:24:01.133]  I'm going from memory.
[00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:01.433]  Four.
[00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:06.337]  I guess one of them died from an infection, that's right, from the bullet wound, so technically he died from it as well.
[00:24:06.337 --> 00:24:09.440]  So, their only option now
[00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:12.133]  Because the Senate gets it.
[00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:14.434]  Trump is now using his constitutional power.
[00:24:14.434 --> 00:24:16.475]  He's got all the emails, all the text.
[00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:22.078]  And suddenly the Senate goes, we know you got a whole bunch of other women lined up as political operatives.
[00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:24.480]  Every one of these stories has already fallen apart.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.803]  We're going to go ahead with the vote on Friday.
[00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:39.348]  And so all the bluster, all the bravado, all the chutzpah, all of it is now beginning
[00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:45.321]  To completely evaporate.
[00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.521]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:56.885]  All their smirking and all their con manning and all their arrogance, all their confidence games are evaporating right now.
[00:25:03.197 --> 00:25:08.360]  So very, very, very good things are taking place.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.862]  But let's not think we're out of the woods yet.
[00:25:10.862 --> 00:25:13.523]  They're going to try to engage in massive election fraud.
[00:25:13.523 --> 00:25:18.767]  Undoubtedly, they are trying to kill Trump right now.
[00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:21.708]  There is no telling what these crooks are going to do.
[00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:24.890]  And they've gone to Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.873]  All these things were set up in covert conjunction with In-Q-Tel and the CIA.
[00:25:29.873 --> 00:25:30.514]  That's on record.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:44.724]  And that group believes they're all taking orders from Obama and Hillary, and as it becomes apparent that President Trump is about to become President for real, get ready.
[00:25:44.724 --> 00:25:49.146]  You know, the President, I told you a month ago, was going to have executive orders against big tech.
[00:25:49.146 --> 00:25:52.347]  I told you he was going to go after Facebook for discrimination.
[00:25:52.347 --> 00:25:54.107]  It happened a week after I told you.
[00:25:54.107 --> 00:25:56.468]  I told you he's got executive orders coming on banking.
[00:25:57.168 --> 00:26:00.491]  I have that directly from people who talk to the President.
[00:26:00.491 --> 00:26:12.761]  I told you that they believe 4.8% growth rate in the economy a month before it happened because I know the individual that had dinner with Kudlow in New York!
[00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:14.743]  He's the Chief Advisor!
[00:26:14.743 --> 00:26:20.608]  You think I just make this stuff up?
[00:26:20.608 --> 00:26:25.572]  And I'm telling you right now, we just turned the
[00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.931]  We just went to the top of the mountain.
[00:26:29.931 --> 00:26:34.873]  Now, we're not over the hump yet, but we are about to go over the hump.
[00:26:34.873 --> 00:26:35.834]  You can feel it.
[00:26:35.834 --> 00:26:49.680]  The enemy is absolutely in panic mode, but I'm telling you, they're desperate criminals that have had power for decades, and I would be surprised if they don't wheel a giant truck bomb into the White House while the President's there and just kill everybody in it if they can.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:55.683]  In fact, if I was the President, because we have the deep state in its own form of martial law, I would be
[00:26:56.946 --> 00:27:11.236]  Locking down streets five blocks around the White House and I would have armored personnel carriers out there with big guns ready to stop armored trucks filled with explosives.
[00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:15.680]  And I would put more missile batteries, I'd just put missile batteries out in the open.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.820]  They already got them in D.C.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:25.146]  They need missile batteries out in the open now with loyal troops, loyal operators, not the normal chain of command because
[00:27:26.181 --> 00:27:29.536]  Believe me, they'll try to fly an airplane into the White House as well.
[00:27:29.536 --> 00:27:31.102]  Or they'll try to shoot down Air Force One.
[00:27:31.707 --> 00:27:43.930]  I know Trump's out front like George Washington at all these rallies and everything and God bless him, but I'm telling you, the next 43 days they are going to try to kill Donald, John, Trump, just as sure as the sun came up.
[00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:50.812]  They aren't shutting me down and engaging in mass censorship and doing this to millions of other conservatives because they're playing games.
[00:27:50.812 --> 00:27:56.034]  They are making their move and they want us shut down when they kill him.
[00:27:58.547 --> 00:28:02.769]  That's why he's got to move on the Justice Department now.
[00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:04.010]  And Mike Adams is right.
[00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.750]  They've already brought us into martial law.
[00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.571]  They've already brought us into civil emergencies.
[00:28:07.571 --> 00:28:11.213]  They've already tried the 25th Amendment four times we know of and failed.
[00:28:11.213 --> 00:28:19.697]  That's four failed co-attempts by these crazy people who've been squatting on this country and selling us out to the shycoms for decades.
[00:28:24.266 --> 00:28:26.127]  And so what does the president do?
[00:28:26.127 --> 00:28:29.228]  When you're met with a home intruder, what do you do?
[00:28:29.228 --> 00:28:33.150]  When you're met with criminals gang raping your country, what do you do?
[00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.231]  There are no half measures with wild criminals.
[00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:41.073]  And the minute he begins to use his power, they begin resigning like the little cowards they are!
[00:28:41.073 --> 00:28:42.754]  Take all their security clearances!
[00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:45.095]  Fire them!
[00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:46.716]  Pull their asses into court!
[00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:55.796]  You need to make these little bastards have the fear of God before they make a move that plunges us into total civil war!
[00:28:55.796 --> 00:28:56.618]  We'll be right back!
[00:28:59.557 --> 00:29:01.719]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[00:29:01.719 --> 00:29:02.499]  Not true.
[00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:04.361]  Actually you are what you can absorb.
[00:29:04.361 --> 00:29:08.364]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[00:29:08.364 --> 00:29:09.485]  Introducing Protovite.

[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.884]  When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers and identity thieves can see anything you do online.

[00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:04.347]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:30:04.347 --> 00:30:11.430]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:16.253]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:30:16.253 --> 00:30:23.136]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system

[00:31:13.553 --> 00:31:29.065]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:34.051]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:31:34.051 --> 00:31:39.294]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:31:39.294 --> 00:31:40.595]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:40.595 --> 00:31:42.436]  It is absolutely free.
[00:31:42.436 --> 00:31:47.640]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.602]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app app.
[00:31:51.602 --> 00:31:55.725]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point blank range.
[00:31:55.725 --> 00:31:59.848]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:32:00.489 --> 00:32:04.419]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:32:05.774 --> 00:32:14.457]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:32:14.457 --> 00:32:16.418]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:32:16.418 --> 00:32:19.879]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:32:19.879 --> 00:32:22.500]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.801]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:32:24.801 --> 00:32:31.744]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:32:32.304 --> 00:32:42.090]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.270]  We'll win.
[00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.172]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:32:46.172 --> 00:32:53.316]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:32:53.316 --> 00:32:57.018]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:58.579]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[00:32:58.579 --> 00:32:59.440]  We need your support.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.000]  I'm counting on you.
[00:33:03.318 --> 00:33:13.371]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:19.579]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.967 --> 00:33:41.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you who we have coming up here on this historic broadcast.
[00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.372]  Every day in the next 43 is incredibly historic.
[00:33:44.372 --> 00:33:46.294]  We're in an amazing time right now.
[00:33:46.294 --> 00:33:50.718]  James O'Keefe, with all the big coups they've just scored against the globalists.
[00:33:51.883 --> 00:34:08.453]  Showing all these different government employees doxing people, using their federal databases, harassing patriots at their homes, using the stolen information for stalking, talking about how they're sabotaging, bringing the economy back, trying to stop the Trump agenda of Make America Great Again.
[00:34:09.727 --> 00:34:17.337]  He is going to be joining us, Roger Stone, on the word that Rosenstein covertly resigned, and now thinks he's going to be fired.
[00:34:17.337 --> 00:34:20.642]  We're going to make heads or tails out of that.
[00:34:20.642 --> 00:34:27.190]  Matt Bracken's joining us, Mike Adams in studio, dealing with the fact that, yes, Obama thinks he's in his third term.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.362]  And they're operating with the deep state like he's still in office.
[00:34:31.362 --> 00:34:35.666]  That's why he shadows the president around because Trump hasn't rescinded.
[00:34:35.666 --> 00:34:37.207]  He rescinded TPP.
[00:34:37.207 --> 00:34:41.810]  He rescinded a bunch of other stuff, but he hasn't rescinded the emergency Obama put in place.
[00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.791]  We're going to read you the U.S.
[00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:45.973]  Code, the executive orders, and what the president needs to do next.
[00:34:47.945 --> 00:34:51.827]  Isn't it funny what you hear on this broadcast ends up being what the president does?
[00:34:51.827 --> 00:34:52.447]  Why is that?
[00:34:52.447 --> 00:35:02.612]  Because I go to the scholarly research, I go to the facts, and I put into the ether, I inject into the bloodstream, the antidote to the globalist poison.
[00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:13.059]  And I put out the leading policy to counter stuff like this that has been already written into policy that they're not telling Trump.
[00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:21.809]  And he's super smart, but he hasn't been studying globalism and COG and the New World Order like I have and Joel Skousen have for decades.
[00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:22.630]  And Skousen's right.
[00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.052]  That's Trump's blind spot.
[00:35:24.052 --> 00:35:25.013]  He has great instincts.
[00:35:27.062 --> 00:35:29.163]  But he doesn't get the full issue.
[00:35:29.163 --> 00:35:31.044]  Also, Paul wrote this article.
[00:35:31.044 --> 00:35:32.905]  This is for the president.
[00:35:32.905 --> 00:35:35.247]  This is for Tucker Carlson.
[00:35:35.247 --> 00:35:38.329]  This is for the folks in D.C.
[00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:40.230]  that asked for this last week.
[00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.752]  You're going to have all week long a series of articles.
[00:35:43.752 --> 00:35:50.075]  This is the first one from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:35:50.075 --> 00:35:53.517]  Big Tech has defined conservatism as hate speech.
[00:35:53.517 --> 00:35:54.478]  That's their game.
[00:35:55.970 --> 00:36:00.673]  Conservatism is against their terms of service.
[00:36:00.673 --> 00:36:05.076]  And then they go, oh, we don't ban conservatives, we ban hate speech.
[00:36:05.076 --> 00:36:09.760]  Oh, it's a game they play, and we have the admissions, we have the links to it, we have all the facts.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:25.451]  Very important article if you want to defeat the globalists, and you want to see good policy now out of the Justice Department taking action for antitrust and cartel behavior, civil rights violations by these groups working in concert, and you don't think we don't have moles inside these meetings?
[00:36:27.529 --> 00:36:30.510]  All of these major companies were set up by the U.S.
[00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.811]  government with private interest.
[00:36:32.811 --> 00:36:35.752]  So there are people inside all of these.
[00:36:35.752 --> 00:36:40.914]  Zuckerberg, Darcy, all of them are being closely watched.
[00:36:40.914 --> 00:36:42.534]  Does that mean the groups watching them are perfect?
[00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:43.755]  No, power corrupts.
[00:36:43.755 --> 00:36:45.756]  But these people are rogue globalists 110%.
[00:36:48.157 --> 00:36:49.818]  Please get this article out.
[00:36:49.818 --> 00:36:52.480]  You are the power of the broadcast now with the shadow banning.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.723]  And I know you get demonized on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and blocked.
[00:36:56.723 --> 00:36:58.725]  And if you attack me, they promote you everywhere.
[00:36:58.725 --> 00:37:02.048]  Oh, and push your videos.
[00:37:02.048 --> 00:37:04.389]  Because that's how the Pavlovian conditioning works.
[00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:09.153]  You have to go through the pain and through the ridicule like I've done to win.
[00:37:09.153 --> 00:37:11.595]  And we are going to win.
[00:37:11.595 --> 00:37:15.598]  You don't think George Washington wasn't demonized and lied about during the Revolutionary War?
[00:37:17.176 --> 00:37:19.697]  It's just like they tried to undermine Trump, but he's broken through that.
[00:37:19.697 --> 00:37:20.937]  So, that's all coming up.
[00:37:20.937 --> 00:37:25.159]  Rosenstein, they're reporting, really resigned Friday.
[00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:26.960]  But then, again, it's all deception with them.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.300]  They think Trump's an idiot.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.141]  So, they wouldn't announce it.
[00:37:30.141 --> 00:37:35.523]  And Bloomberg says they don't know why.
[00:37:35.523 --> 00:37:46.447]  It's because they wanted to trick Trump into announcing he was gone to then act like Trump had gotten rid of him because they've already set it up that if he got rid of Rosenstein, he was sabotaging the fake Mueller probe.
[00:37:48.114 --> 00:37:49.894]  The Mueller probe.
[00:37:49.894 --> 00:37:51.575]  So again, they're playing some serious games.
[00:37:51.575 --> 00:37:52.955]  We're watching it right now.
[00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:56.876]  We'll give you the latest as it unfolds here today.
[00:37:56.876 --> 00:38:01.117]  But this is an incredible time to be alive and we're seeing amazing things happening.
[00:38:01.117 --> 00:38:04.178]  Listen, I don't like being persecuted.
[00:38:04.178 --> 00:38:05.459]  I don't like being demonized.
[00:38:05.459 --> 00:38:10.400]  I don't like being the most banned person in the free world or what was free.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.501]  But if I have to do it to change things, I will do it.
[00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:18.102]  And that's the example I'm trying to give.
[00:38:18.102 --> 00:38:23.105]  I'm not trying to work within the system when the system's been taken over by criminals.
[00:38:23.105 --> 00:38:27.908]  I'm trying to take our republic back and get our constitutional system back in place.
[00:38:27.908 --> 00:38:39.214]  And not that it's perfect, but it's light years better than rogue, out-of-control corporations and bureaucracies and people like Rosenstein and McCabe acting like they're God.
[00:38:39.214 --> 00:38:40.115]  And finally, Trump
[00:38:41.627 --> 00:38:51.755]  Is moving against them with all these secret documents that prove they're criminals, and they don't know what to do.
[00:38:51.755 --> 00:38:54.717]  So again, now is the time to be strong.
[00:38:54.717 --> 00:38:59.761]  Now is the time to be focused, and now is the time to be praying for President Trump, and please pray for Infowars.
[00:38:59.761 --> 00:39:05.145]  And again, I stuck my neck out there, because I believe in you.
[00:39:05.145 --> 00:39:09.408]  I believe that if we expose world government, the tyrants, and what they were doing, that you would respond.
[00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:22.243]  That, yes, those of us that stuck our necks out would be targeted, but the globalists believe by persecuting us that'll scare you away.
[00:39:22.243 --> 00:39:25.945]  Yeah, it'll scare the cowards away.
[00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:28.967]  But it will only activate the real men and women out there.
[00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:30.928]  And you are the real men and women.
[00:39:30.928 --> 00:39:36.652]  This broadcast, the audience of activists that listen, no matter if you're old or young, black, white, Hispanic, you name it.
[00:39:36.652 --> 00:39:41.495]  Whether you're from Cuba, whether you're from Russia, whether you're from Brazil, or whether you're from Germany.
[00:39:43.507 --> 00:39:50.812]  Whether you're from Mexico or whether you're from Canada, if you love liberty and you love freedom, and you believe in people's basic freedom, then we are brothers and sisters.
[00:39:50.812 --> 00:39:56.937]  And these elitists are superpower mad because they don't have innate power, and they have seized control of our nation.
[00:39:57.867 --> 00:40:22.284]  Now, that said, you'd think I'd be making a big deal out of the fact that PayPal, one of the biggest payment processors in the world, who's buying up most of the other payment processors, that's another antitrust issue, they're making global consolidations with Soros right now, one of the largest global payment processors, and I believe it's an antitrust violation, and I believe that they should be broken up because of that, and that this big deal they've got coming up at the end of the month should be stopped.
[00:40:22.284 --> 00:40:23.125]  I'll get to that more later.
[00:40:27.768 --> 00:40:29.768]  And yes, this is literal mark of the beast.
[00:40:29.768 --> 00:40:43.491]  Big banking cartels, big media cartels, IT cartels, tech cartels, with a global social score, deplatforming someone and now saying you can't even have banking.
[00:40:43.491 --> 00:40:46.252]  Imagine what Hitler would have done with technology like that.
[00:40:46.252 --> 00:40:48.752]  This is illegal.
[00:40:48.752 --> 00:40:52.653]  And we are going to be forced to take action on this one.
[00:40:52.653 --> 00:40:54.754]  It's so discriminatory.
[00:40:54.754 --> 00:40:55.994]  It's so incredibly serious.
[00:40:57.932 --> 00:40:58.852]  And it affects everyone.
[00:40:58.852 --> 00:41:02.514]  So we still have PayPal for another eight working days, they say.
[00:41:02.514 --> 00:41:03.614]  They could cancel at any time.
[00:41:03.614 --> 00:41:06.815]  And we have other payment processing systems there on the site you can choose from.
[00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:09.376]  The New York Times and people are like, he's crippled.
[00:41:09.376 --> 00:41:10.077]  He's going down.
[00:41:10.077 --> 00:41:11.477]  All those payment processing is shut down.
[00:41:11.477 --> 00:41:18.660]  I don't know if they want fake victories or whether they're that stupid, but clearly they're going to go after all of it.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.421]  And the injunctions and the lawsuits and all that are obviously coming.
[00:41:23.194 --> 00:41:24.394]  They're going to go after everybody next.
[00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:29.035]  This is already happening to Jihad Watch, and David Horowitz, and everybody else.
[00:41:29.035 --> 00:41:37.537]  And we stood up for Wikileaks when they had their PayPal blocked, and then there was a big operation launched against Visa, MasterCard, and others, and they had to back off.
[00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:46.078]  People need to rally behind InfoWars, and the best way to do it is financially, and by word of mouth, spreading InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:41:46.078 --> 00:41:48.639]  And telling people, find out why it's verboten.
[00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.079]  Find out why they want it shut down.
[00:41:51.059 --> 00:41:58.023]  And so, we don't have new specials yet, and it's our last run of the Survival Shield X2, the only type from Deep Earth Crystals.
[00:41:58.023 --> 00:42:00.524]  It's 999999, you know, pure or more.
[00:42:00.524 --> 00:42:03.686]  It's actually 99.999 and a whole bunch of nines.
[00:42:03.686 --> 00:42:04.947]  It's so amazing, the good halogen.
[00:42:04.947 --> 00:42:06.407]  That's still 25% off.
[00:42:06.407 --> 00:42:08.709]  That special will have to end.
[00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:14.783]  Because it is the last run of it, and it's selling a lot faster than I thought.
[00:42:14.783 --> 00:42:17.805]  Also, Brain Force Plus is 40% off.
[00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:21.146]  That is our new special, now with 20% more each bottle and 40% off.
[00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:22.887]  Sheikra 12, that are.
[00:42:22.887 --> 00:42:28.450]  So I guess they just got the new specials up minutes ago because they hadn't done it.
[00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:32.612]  Click on last run X2, see if that's still 25% off.
[00:42:32.612 --> 00:42:35.533]  Because it hadn't gotten done today.
[00:42:35.533 --> 00:42:36.174]  Okay, it still is.
[00:42:37.091 --> 00:42:37.871]  Still is 25% off.
[00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:38.792]  Okay.
[00:42:38.792 --> 00:42:44.453]  So, take advantage of that at InfoWarsTore.com and send a strong message to the globalists that you're going to back the First Amendment.

[00:44:53.342 --> 00:44:58.445]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:02.626]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:45:02.626 --> 00:45:04.787]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:45:04.787 --> 00:45:07.589]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:45:08.715 --> 00:45:20.200]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:29.284]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[00:45:35.586 --> 00:45:41.028]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[00:45:41.028 --> 00:45:43.289]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:45:43.289 --> 00:45:45.310]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[00:45:46.582 --> 00:45:49.585]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:45:49.585 --> 00:45:51.607]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:45:51.607 --> 00:45:54.931]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:57.474]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[00:45:57.474 --> 00:45:59.697]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[00:46:04.142 --> 00:46:09.868]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:46:09.868 --> 00:46:17.735]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:46:17.735 --> 00:46:20.878]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:26.340]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.120]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:38.103]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:46:38.283 --> 00:46:39.664]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:19.961 --> 00:47:24.804]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:47:24.804 --> 00:47:32.849]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:41.254]  Well, the Washington Times is reporting that Rosenstein did resign last week, so has Bloomberg, but did it verbally.
[00:47:41.254 --> 00:47:43.815]  Now they're trying to make Trump basically firing.
[00:47:43.815 --> 00:47:45.156]  A lot of chicanery going on.
[00:47:45.156 --> 00:47:46.197]  Noel Francisco
[00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:51.871]  The solicitor general is slated to take it over.
[00:47:51.871 --> 00:47:53.812]  That's been reported by the Washington Times.
[00:47:53.812 --> 00:47:58.595]  Dow drops to session lows and reports that Rod Rosenstein has resigned at CNBC.
[00:47:58.595 --> 00:48:01.436]  So joining us is Roger Stone.
[00:48:01.436 --> 00:48:07.739]  Notice, Roger, as you said back when Trump first got in office, declassify all the illegal spying.
[00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:14.383]  That will destroy these criminals and their arrogance and text messages bragging about their plan to remove the president.
[00:48:14.383 --> 00:48:16.044]  Trump even threatening to release that.
[00:48:17.148 --> 00:48:20.911]  And now has the Inspector General overseeing what they are going to release.
[00:48:20.911 --> 00:48:24.934]  Finally he took the gloves off and finally they are going to their knees.
[00:48:24.934 --> 00:48:30.799]  That is my view on this and I think it's now time for Trump to move big time ahead of the election.
[00:48:30.799 --> 00:48:32.321]  Don't listen to mainstream media.
[00:48:32.321 --> 00:48:37.125]  Act bold and we will see this country safe.
[00:48:37.125 --> 00:48:37.505]  What do you think?
[00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:40.150]  You know, Alex, I agree with you.
[00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:52.336]  I think it's a seminal moment now where the President not only needs to act, but then he needs to go to the American people and explain precisely what he's doing and why he's doing it.
[00:48:52.336 --> 00:49:02.262]  I was not pleased that he ordered the declassification of the FISA documents, which really document the efforts to illegally and unconstitutionally spy
[00:49:03.222 --> 00:49:18.687]  On the campaign of Donald Trump using the machinery of the Obama Justice Department and Obama intelligence agencies to do so and then he demurred because he would be because of an argument by Rod Rosenstein
[00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:26.114]  That such declassification would harm our national security and would expose our sources and methods.
[00:49:26.114 --> 00:49:38.586]  The only thing that's going to expose Alex is the criminal activity of the Obama gang and the cabal at the Justice Department that includes Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller.
[00:49:38.586 --> 00:49:40.769]  The President should not be dissuaded
[00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:52.025]  It's very interesting that even in sending it to the Inspector General, he still said, at the end of the day, I'll decide what I'm going to do about these releases.
[00:49:52.025 --> 00:49:54.268]  So he reserved the power unto himself.
[00:49:55.131 --> 00:50:01.833]  I'm not certain that Noel Francisco, the Solicitor General, is next in line.
[00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:13.377]  I believe that Rosenstein and Reince Priebus, the first White House Chief of Staff, plotted and may have got the President to sign off on a plan to change that.
[00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.138]  I'm looking for some clarification.
[00:50:15.418 --> 00:50:17.720]  But the president can change that plan whenever he wants.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:26.649]  Now, expanding on that, there's also some newspapers reporting that Rosenstein's actually taking part in cabinet meetings right now and thought he'd be fired but wasn't.
[00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:29.751]  And Bloomberg and others are reporting that he resigned on Friday.
[00:50:29.751 --> 00:50:37.539]  It looks like they're trying to create a bunch of confusion to make the president fire him so they can then act like he's covering up the Mueller probe.
[00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:42.070]  Yeah, I think that it may be what they're up to.
[00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:48.831]  Mark Levin, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, others have taken that point of view, that this is a provocation.
[00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.072]  They're not saying that Rosenstein shouldn't be fired.
[00:50:51.072 --> 00:51:05.735]  I think what they're saying is he should be fired after the election, a few short weeks from now, so that the mainstream media cannot create some Saturday Night Massacre type frenzy, particularly in the wake of this
[00:51:08.182 --> 00:51:15.285]  This is a new thing, Alex, where any woman can come forward and claim sexual assault.
[00:51:15.285 --> 00:51:20.867]  She doesn't have to have witnesses, corroboration, contemporaneous noting of it.
[00:51:20.867 --> 00:51:22.728]  She can just say it.
[00:51:22.728 --> 00:51:25.409]  And because she's a woman, we have to believe her.
[00:51:25.409 --> 00:51:28.491]  Because she's a woman, we have to view her as credible.
[00:51:28.491 --> 00:51:30.932]  Now this second woman has come forward.
[00:51:30.932 --> 00:51:34.193]  Her claim seems to be even weaker than the first one.
[00:51:34.193 --> 00:51:35.374]  And let's go back to this.
[00:51:37.625 --> 00:51:52.293]  The media is now reporting on keg parties that happened 36 years ago at a high school, 35 years ago at a college, and all the witnesses that both women put forward say this is totally made up, we were never even at a party, this is insane.
[00:51:52.293 --> 00:51:58.497]  But I predicted last week that they would start bringing for more women at the end to cover up for the last fake claim.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:06.105]  I think you were exactly on the money with that prediction, and we see it unfolding before our very eyes.
[00:52:06.105 --> 00:52:10.489]  Notice that this woman wasn't sure six days ago that it was Kavanaugh.
[00:52:10.489 --> 00:52:16.294]  And then after intense conversation with Senate Democrat staffers, now she's sure it was Kavanaugh.
[00:52:16.294 --> 00:52:21.979]  You know, Ronan Farrow, who I think did a great job in exposing the Weinstein scandal,
[00:52:22.561 --> 00:52:22.621]  I'm
[00:52:39.002 --> 00:52:39.823]  Well, that's right, Roger.
[00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:44.786]  I'm now seeing major talking points in the corporate media that if someone says something, the accused is guilty.
[00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:45.026]  No.
[00:52:45.026 --> 00:52:52.671]  In Western jurisprudence, and in our Constitution, Bill of Rights, everything, you are innocent until proven guilty.
[00:52:52.671 --> 00:53:01.137]  And if there's a statute of limitations, you can't even look at it, because it's famous that people make things up against famous people many decades later.
[00:53:01.137 --> 00:53:07.681]  And then, when all the person's witnesses actually say the opposite, you're called impeached.
[00:53:07.681 --> 00:53:08.882]  You are discredited.
[00:53:10.105 --> 00:53:11.588]  Yeah, it's really incredible.
[00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:16.218]  There are actually some talking heads saying, well, Kavanaugh should just now withdraw.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.021]  Under no circumstances should he do so.
[00:53:20.021 --> 00:53:25.203]  If he withdraws, Alex, people will read into that that he's guilty, that he's done something wrong.
[00:53:25.203 --> 00:53:29.805]  And isn't it good news that the Republican leadership is saying we think this is all politically motivated now?
[00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:36.947]  They've gone from prostrating themselves and gesticulating on the ground in a supine position to now saying this is a bunch of political crap.
[00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:37.947]  We're going to confirm him.
[00:53:37.947 --> 00:53:39.188]  We're moving forward, dead ahead.
[00:53:40.809 --> 00:53:41.710]  It's an improvement.
[00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:48.717]  Remember when Anita Hill made these similar charges against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas?
[00:53:48.717 --> 00:53:56.644]  She was subjected to the withering cross-examination by Senator Arlen Specter and her case essentially fell apart.
[00:53:56.644 --> 00:54:00.768]  Then the liberals said, Specter will pay a terrible price for this at the polls.
[00:54:00.768 --> 00:54:01.729]  He was re-elected.
[00:54:02.541 --> 00:54:10.826]  One senator with guts right now could change history, but instead the Senate majority on judiciary says the questioning of Ms.
[00:54:10.826 --> 00:54:15.849]  Ford, the first witness, will be conducted by a female Senate staffer.
[00:54:16.641 --> 00:54:18.062]  A lack of courage, in my view.
[00:54:18.062 --> 00:54:18.863]  Think about that.
[00:54:18.863 --> 00:54:20.664]  Women are equal to men.
[00:54:20.664 --> 00:54:23.626]  Women can do anything men can do.
[00:54:23.626 --> 00:54:30.771]  And so, women are in a man's world, or men are in a woman's world, but now only a woman can talk to her.
[00:54:30.771 --> 00:54:36.614]  She gets to make these accusations that have already fallen completely apart, and then only a woman can question her.
[00:54:36.614 --> 00:54:41.918]  Oh, so see, this is the left trying to have chivalry, but also not having chivalry.
[00:54:41.918 --> 00:54:43.079]  So they jump back and forth.
[00:54:44.298 --> 00:54:54.083]  Well, it's also the cowardice of certain career politicians who don't want to risk a backlash back in their home states because they were tough in questioning a woman.
[00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:56.364]  Some senator simply needs to say, Ms.
[00:54:56.364 --> 00:54:59.546]  Ford, is there a witness to anything you're telling us?
[00:54:59.546 --> 00:55:02.167]  Do you have any corroboration whatsoever?
[00:55:02.167 --> 00:55:03.788]  Did you note it in a book?
[00:55:03.788 --> 00:55:06.249]  Did you tell one of your girlfriends at the time?
[00:55:06.249 --> 00:55:06.929]  Something?
[00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:07.570]  Anything?
[00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:07.910]  That's right.
[00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.150]  Roger, I want to shift gears briefly.
[00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:11.031]  You're going to be joining us again on The War Room today.
[00:55:11.031 --> 00:55:12.312]  We have a special guest.
[00:55:12.332 --> 00:55:14.133]  A broadcast that's going to go from 8 a.m.
[00:55:14.133 --> 00:55:15.995]  to midnight on Wednesday.
[00:55:15.995 --> 00:55:16.855]  Stand with Trump.
[00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:17.976]  Stand with Infowar.
[00:55:17.976 --> 00:55:19.678]  Stand with free speech.
[00:55:19.678 --> 00:55:20.538]  Stand with victory.
[00:55:20.538 --> 00:55:24.822]  It's going to be a special broadcast we're going to be doing because we're being banned off PayPal.
[00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:27.143]  They're trying to take our payment processing completely away.
[00:55:27.143 --> 00:55:28.925]  That would shut us down, and they're able to do it.
[00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:39.433]  Listeners, so please financially support us at InfowarStore.com while you still can, and stock up on the great books, t-shirts, and videos that, I guess if they're successful shutting us down, will be real collector's items.
[00:55:39.433 --> 00:55:40.994]  But, you know, I'm going down swinging.
[00:55:41.374 --> 00:55:44.675]  And I think our destruction will be an example to many, many others.
[00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:47.817]  But we are in a real battle for our lives here.
[00:55:47.817 --> 00:55:49.777]  James Woods has been banned now.
[00:55:49.777 --> 00:55:50.698]  Everybody's getting banned.
[00:55:50.698 --> 00:55:52.078]  This is total evil.
[00:55:52.078 --> 00:55:53.379]  But just very briefly, Roger...
[00:55:54.748 --> 00:55:58.150]  I think this signals Trump taking the gloves off.
[00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:00.931]  Him saying he'll declassify this stuff, which is still going to get declassified.
[00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:05.373]  It's just being reviewed by the Inspector General there at the Justice Department.
[00:56:05.373 --> 00:56:08.315]  I think Trump has really turned the corner, and I sense victory.
[00:56:08.315 --> 00:56:15.198]  And you see them caving in right now, and Rosenstein caving in, because Trump is finally acting like the President when it comes to standing up to the deep state.
[00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:19.293]  I think you're again, you're right, Alex.
[00:56:19.293 --> 00:56:23.137]  I think that if Rosenstein didn't resign today, he's going to get fired.
[00:56:23.137 --> 00:56:24.538]  It may not be today.
[00:56:24.538 --> 00:56:27.981]  Maybe it's two weeks from now, but I think his number is up.
[00:56:27.981 --> 00:56:33.185]  What's funny is seeing the NBC's and the others trying to say, oh, no, he was only joking.
[00:56:33.185 --> 00:56:35.267]  No, he was not joking.
[00:56:35.267 --> 00:56:41.352]  He talked about wearing a wire to entrap the president of the United States to remove him under the 25th
[00:56:41.852 --> 00:56:46.174]  But you were the first person 20 months ago to predict what was already going on, and now it's all confirmed.
[00:56:46.174 --> 00:56:59.460]  Because they're all a bunch of yes-men cowards, of the deep state, carrying out crimes for the Bushes and the Clintons for 20 years, and they believe they own this country and the people, and they all thought they'd bring Trump down, but now it's blown up in their face, and now the real battle's been joined.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.262]  But I think Trump is now in the maximum physical danger, Roger.
[00:57:04.237 --> 00:57:10.965]  I agree once again, and let's face it, the silencing of Infowars was always part of their plan.
[00:57:10.965 --> 00:57:19.275]  Shutting Alex Jones up, getting him off of social media, shutting him down is a key part of their takedown plan for the president.
[00:57:19.275 --> 00:57:20.756]  That's the real canary in the coal mine.
[00:57:20.756 --> 00:57:22.257]  God bless you, Roger Stone.
[00:57:22.257 --> 00:57:26.740]  Coming up, James O'Keefe with more, then Mike Adams, then Matt Bracken.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:33.064]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today, the most banned broadcast in the world.

[00:59:44.605 --> 00:59:47.207]  From InfoWarsLife at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:00:07.273 --> 01:00:10.822]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:10.822 --> 01:00:14.952]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:29.220]  Well, Bloomberg, AP, everyone reported an hour ago that Rosenstein resigned on Friday, was summoned to the White House, and then we began hearing 30 minutes later that, well, he hadn't really resigned or it wasn't being accepted.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.822]  Well, now Rosenstein has not resigned, still U.S.
[01:00:31.822 --> 01:00:32.742]  Deputy Attorney General.
[01:00:32.742 --> 01:00:36.745]  There's a Reuters headline, there's AP on screen breaking White House.
[01:00:36.745 --> 01:00:42.670]  Trump, Rosenstein spoke Monday, will meet Thursday at White House amid uncertainty about Deputy AG's fate.
[01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:47.964]  So it looks like they tried to get the president to jump the gun to get rid of him.
[01:00:47.964 --> 01:00:50.305]  They reportedly told Kelly he was resigning.
[01:00:50.305 --> 01:00:54.529]  Now the media tried to spin it that Trump's getting rid of him to say that he's purging the Mueller probe.
[01:00:54.529 --> 01:00:57.951]  The Mueller probe has fallen flat on its face.
[01:00:57.951 --> 01:01:01.494]  And what, gotten people convicted of not paying taxes 15 years ago?
[01:01:01.494 --> 01:01:06.077]  Or raided people over payments to girlfriends decades ago?
[01:01:06.077 --> 01:01:07.298]  It is incredible.
[01:01:07.298 --> 01:01:09.420]  What we have is a permanent deep state.
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:23.329]  Obama signed all these executive orders for the CIA, Defense Department, FBI, and Justice Department, we're going to James O'Keefe here in about 10 seconds, to basically be the resistance and stay behind.
[01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:25.611]  But it's not just in words they're doing it.
[01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:28.433]  Obama moved in down the street from the White House.
[01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:34.377]  Hillary and others and Brennan are saying, hold on, don't follow what the President says.
[01:01:34.377 --> 01:01:34.958]  Resist him.
[01:01:35.939 --> 01:01:40.282]  And so they basically have a parallel government operating, a rogue government.
[01:01:40.282 --> 01:01:48.987]  And we've known this for a long time, and now we know Rosenstein and others want to use the 25th Amendment to remove the president, which even CNN calls a political apocalypse.
[01:01:48.987 --> 01:01:52.310]  Well, James O'Keefe joins us for this segment and the next Project Veritas.
[01:01:53.072 --> 01:01:54.993]  With some of their biggest bombshells yet.
[01:01:54.993 --> 01:02:00.316]  He can only do two segments, so after he leaves, I'm going to play the boil-downs that he's going to be talking about here.
[01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:03.978]  Or we're live now, cut him in later into post when we re-upload this to the web.
[01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:11.802]  But this is a big deal, and your investigation couldn't come at a better time, just like you exposed election fraud in 2016 and other big issues.
[01:02:11.802 --> 01:02:20.406]  So, how does your investigation, before we get into the details of the next segment, fit in really perfectly?
[01:02:20.406 --> 01:02:21.247]  But I want you to elaborate.
[01:02:22.575 --> 01:02:30.183]  On this whole rogue deep state, now out in the open and Democrats cheering it on MSNBC saying, rogue state killed Trump!
[01:02:30.183 --> 01:02:32.606]  I mean this really looks like they've jumped the shark, James.
[01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:37.463]  Well, Alex, it's great to be with you here and I do have some breaking news.
[01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:39.705]  This happened like minutes ago.
[01:02:39.705 --> 01:02:42.248]  I got a statement from the Justice Department.
[01:02:42.248 --> 01:02:49.636]  Sarah Flores, Director of Public Affairs, says, quote, Allison Raybar is no longer an employee at the Justice Department.
[01:02:49.636 --> 01:02:51.498]  That was at midnight last night.
[01:02:52.999 --> 01:02:57.563]  Two individuals we caught on tape no longer have jobs in the federal government.
[01:02:57.563 --> 01:03:05.091]  So when people talk about draining the swamp, Project Veritas actually, to some small way, has actually drained part of the swamp.
[01:03:05.091 --> 01:03:07.533]  The communist at GAO, self-described communist,
[01:03:09.114 --> 01:03:25.590]  Is out of a job, and now Alison Raybar is out of a job at the Justice Department, Alex, after these four individuals we caught on tape talking about resisting, resisting the Trump administration, resisting the will of the people, talking about how they can't get fired for anything!
[01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:32.114]  Is what Alison Raybar said, resisting inside the Justice Department, saying she has colleagues doing so.
[01:03:32.114 --> 01:03:34.836]  So Alex, this is about the separation of powers.
[01:03:34.836 --> 01:03:37.177]  It's about equal justice under the law.
[01:03:37.177 --> 01:03:42.801]  It's about subverting the will of the people and replacing the Constitution with political whim.
[01:03:42.801 --> 01:03:54.569]  This is about a lot of things, but of all the things it's about, it personifies, it puts a face to the name of who these deep state bureaucratic operators, who they are.
[01:03:54.569 --> 01:03:55.169]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:57.032 --> 01:04:06.686]  Again, you've got them on tape talking about doxing people, going to their homes, how they work inside the government to sabotage the Trump agenda.
[01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:11.293]  I mean, these people are frightening in just how arrogant they are.
[01:04:12.594 --> 01:04:14.355]  Very arrogant, a lot of hubris.
[01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:20.938]  In fact, the State Department official, Alex, said, you know, it's impossible to fire a federal employee.
[01:04:20.938 --> 01:04:31.923]  And the face this guy makes, I'm assuming you're going to pull that video up here shortly, the amount of arrogance, the greed, and they're using the rules of our government, a.k.a.
[01:04:31.923 --> 01:04:36.925]  you can't get fired, civil service reform is not happening, so no one can ever get fired.
[01:04:37.345 --> 01:04:39.206]  These guys probably didn't get fired.
[01:04:39.206 --> 01:04:45.511]  They probably resigned after, you know, after being put in a room and interrogated by their leadership.
[01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:48.653]  You can't get fired for anything being a federal government employee.
[01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:51.555]  So let's come back and talk about how we drain the swamp with James O'Keefe.
[01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:58.159]  I want the next shoe to drop is straight ahead with James O'Keefe back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:58.159 --> 01:05:00.981]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:05.705]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:05:07.276 --> 01:05:18.126]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.126 --> 01:05:20.247]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:24.251]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.251 --> 01:05:25.452]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:31.476]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.476 --> 01:05:33.878]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.878 --> 01:05:36.519]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:37.460]  That's my dad.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.301]  The colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.301 --> 01:05:41.803]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.803 --> 01:05:50.989]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:55.432]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:02.359 --> 01:06:08.945]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:08.945 --> 01:06:12.869]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:06:20.453 --> 01:06:29.597]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.597 --> 01:06:34.839]  And I point that out because we have the deep state, we have the bureaucracy out of control.
[01:06:34.839 --> 01:06:38.021]  And it believes it runs things, not the Congress, not the President.
[01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:46.585]  And now we see on display Rod Rosenstein and these text messages, and we're going to have 25th Amendment, and we're going to ignore the President, and we're going to do whatever we want.
[01:06:47.225 --> 01:06:51.709]  And then you have James O'Keefe with all these undercover videos at ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:53.030]  They're up on Infowars.com.
[01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:54.812]  He's with us for this segment.
[01:06:54.812 --> 01:06:59.736]  When we come back next segment, I'm going to play some of the highlights of this, but he's breaking it down.
[01:06:59.736 --> 01:07:04.120]  Again, perfect timing with Trump battling the deep state and rogue government.
[01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:08.254]  Literally saying they're taking their orders from Hillary and Obama.
[01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:12.238]  They call her Madam President still.
[01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:16.683]  Just the arrogance, the attitude, the videos you have of them saying, we're never going to get fired.
[01:07:16.683 --> 01:07:18.925]  We're part of the Socialist and Communist Party.
[01:07:18.925 --> 01:07:20.747]  We're going to take over America.
[01:07:20.747 --> 01:07:23.050]  And then you look at how wimpy they are, but...
[01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:33.954]  Still, they're in charge, they live off our tax money, and so it's the arrogance, it's the chicken-neckness, it's the stupidness of them, but then it makes me feel stupid.
[01:07:33.954 --> 01:07:37.055]  How do we ever let this much scum run our lives, James O'Keefe?
[01:07:37.802 --> 01:07:54.030]  Well, Alex, you know, this is why maybe we need civil service reform, because the Deep State is not just the director of the Intelligence Agency and Rosenstein and whoever else, it's also millions of foot soldiers, thousands and thousands of these people that we've caught on tape.
[01:07:54.030 --> 01:08:06.356]  This is just a small cross-sampling of them, and yes, if you look at these tapes, what's remarkable is, I mean, the guy that we released Thursday, this self-described communist inside a government auditor's office,
[01:08:06.936 --> 01:08:27.500]  He says, what I do is explicitly prohibited, I'm hungover, I don't even go to work, I spend my time, this is what he says on the tape, I spend my time electing democratic socialists, and I lied on my forms to the federal government, but nothing will ever happen to me, because there's no oversight, nobody will care, it's impossible to get fired.
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:30.681]  There he is right there, Nate Subramanian, auditor at GAO.
[01:08:31.181 --> 01:08:34.724]  So it's just, these are what they call the Democratic Socialists of America.
[01:08:34.724 --> 01:08:36.345]  A lot of them are federal employees.
[01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:38.367]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:08:38.367 --> 01:08:39.528]  This is videotape.
[01:08:39.528 --> 01:08:46.293]  And by the way, the man you're looking at right there, that man right there, he has been shown the door at GAO.
[01:08:46.293 --> 01:08:51.197]  While they can't, may not be able to, quote, fire him, they have removed him from the building.
[01:08:51.197 --> 01:08:52.958]  This is like a Greek tragedy.
[01:08:52.958 --> 01:08:57.422]  They can't fire the people, so they just have to, like, take them away from their computer systems.
[01:08:57.963 --> 01:09:07.624]  So this is just a few of many, many things dropping at Project Veritas, but we're getting the results, we're drawing blood, and we're getting some serious reactions.
[01:09:09.696 --> 01:09:30.932]  You know, isn't this a form of racketeering and organized crime that you've got the Democratic Socialists of America hooked in with Sanders, all of them, and they've got thousands of people just in that one cult or syndicate, in my view, operating in government, obviously being directed, because you've got all these videos at different offices, different agencies, they're all saying the exact same things.
[01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:34.595]  They're getting programmed by a central big brain.
[01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:38.812]  Yeah, well Alex, there is a conspiracy law.
[01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:43.637]  I don't have it in front of me, but we sent it out to our mailing list.
[01:09:43.637 --> 01:09:46.900]  There is a conspiracy to defraud the U.S.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.321]  government.
[01:09:47.321 --> 01:09:48.262]  It's a federal felony.
[01:09:48.903 --> 01:09:50.344]  And it carries time in prison.
[01:09:50.344 --> 01:09:59.692]  And our lawyers have informed us that these democratic socialist federal workers, these deep state people, could be in violation of that federal statute.
[01:09:59.692 --> 01:10:01.693]  And don't take my word for it.
[01:10:01.693 --> 01:10:07.578]  The State Department, Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, has reacted to these videos.
[01:10:08.158 --> 01:10:13.960]  So has the Justice Department, so is Health and Human Services, and so is the Government Accountability Office.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.861]  Everyone's taking this very seriously.
[01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:22.343]  To get two federal workers to effectively lose their jobs is a very big deal in this country.
[01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.104]  And you did it in just... It's very hard to do.
[01:10:24.104 --> 01:10:25.144]  And you did it just in one week.
[01:10:26.405 --> 01:10:27.306]  In three days.
[01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.589]  We got a couple more coming here.
[01:10:29.589 --> 01:10:36.980]  We have the Kavanaugh distraction happening over the last two and a half weeks, which is making our jobs difficult to break through the news cycle.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:40.485]  But we are getting the reactions from government and obviously there's more to come.
[01:10:43.504 --> 01:10:51.631]  You broke news last year and this year at New York Times, YouTube, Google, where they say Alex Jones is our number one enemy.
[01:10:51.631 --> 01:10:54.473]  And I bring myself up because now they're taking our PayPal away.
[01:10:54.473 --> 01:10:57.176]  That's gone in eight business days.
[01:10:57.176 --> 01:11:01.800]  They're saying they want, they have Democrats in congressional hearings saying they want me off the air.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.303]  Now James Woods has been taken off Twitter, suspended.
[01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:08.746]  They're persecuting everyone I know that's a libertarian, a Christian, a patriot.
[01:11:09.446 --> 01:11:15.533]  People I know that are just Christians and just share Bible verses are being kicked off Twitter, who've been on for years.
[01:11:15.533 --> 01:11:23.301]  There is a giant purge going on and it really is cartels in a conspiracy against our free speech.
[01:11:23.301 --> 01:11:30.629]  And again, this ties into this arrogance of government, the bureaucracies, the Democrats in Congress, and big tech.
[01:11:31.778 --> 01:11:37.028]  And Hollywood all ganged up on America, but still America's coming back from the dead.
[01:11:37.028 --> 01:11:41.296]  Can you speak to other investigations just into the big tech situations?
[01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:44.382]  Are the presidents now really paying attention to that and what do you think should be done?
[01:11:45.296 --> 01:11:51.217]  Well, I saw the executive order or the discussion of the executive order from Trump, and I think that's interesting.
[01:11:51.217 --> 01:11:55.638]  I don't know what the solutions are, whether it's anti-trust legislation or an executive order.
[01:11:55.638 --> 01:12:00.999]  Alex, in previous segments with you, I've said that we just need to expose it.
[01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:02.139]  We need to illuminate it.
[01:12:02.139 --> 01:12:04.659]  We need to outrage people.
[01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:13.761]  I am concerned that they're doing this in public now, and maybe we don't need the hidden camera exposés in general, but I still think
[01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:22.323]  That the engineers, to get the engineers to admit, like we did with those Twitter engineers, to admit how they ban you and why they ban you.
[01:12:22.323 --> 01:12:30.045]  I know James Woods was removed and the thinking was because, you know, he's influencing an election.
[01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:33.366]  I mean... That's what citizens do!
[01:12:33.366 --> 01:12:34.286]  That's what citizens do!
[01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:37.967]  They're trying some campaign finance law saying we can't have political views.
[01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:52.257]  But if we get them to admit Alex in the way that Project Veritas often does, the motivations more explicitly and inflammatory... They just said, we hate veterans, we hate Alex Jones, we hate the American flag, on video!
[01:12:52.257 --> 01:12:59.883]  Or just that we cannot allow Republicans to win office, therefore we have to remove... By the way, that's not a conspiracy.
[01:12:59.883 --> 01:13:00.804]  You have it on video.
[01:13:00.804 --> 01:13:03.446]  We're foreshadowing to what we have coming out.
[01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:04.948]  We have sources on the inside.
[01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:07.490]  The difference is, I don't want to release documentation
[01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.791]  We're good to go.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:28.424]  And there he is dancing with typical arrogance of a Project Veritas target.
[01:13:28.424 --> 01:13:33.708]  So, we have to get the visual confirmation because the media holds us to a higher standard.
[01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:36.730]  They will not believe me if I just report what a source told me.
[01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:37.891]  I have to actually catch the source.
[01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:41.294]  Oh, and they always say you selectively edit even though you put out hours of it.
[01:13:41.294 --> 01:13:42.215]  But they know they're liars.
[01:13:42.675 --> 01:13:54.043]  Bob Woodward, who wrote the book Fear, takes his quotes from anonymous sources who relay other quotes from other anonymous sources months after the incidents in question, and then he puts that information in quotation marks.
[01:13:54.043 --> 01:13:57.165]  If that is not selective editing, then what is?
[01:13:57.165 --> 01:14:02.568]  I mean, it's a absurd standard they hold us to, Alex, but we have to live up to that standard.
[01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:03.689]  We have to.
[01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:08.312]  We have to show the American people the reality of what these people are saying and doing.
[01:14:08.312 --> 01:14:10.594]  The deep state stuff is drawing blood.
[01:14:10.594 --> 01:14:12.155]  The deep state stuff is effective.
[01:14:12.635 --> 01:14:21.738]  And I've had multiple reporters, Alex, from Washington Post, New York Times, privately email me and say, how the heck did you get these guys to talk?
[01:14:21.738 --> 01:14:26.919]  So they're quietly impressed by the things that we're exposing.
[01:14:26.919 --> 01:14:29.700]  I just wish that they would do their jobs.
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:35.021]  Well, there's no doubt they've whipped themselves in government and in media into a criminal frenzy when Hillary lost.
[01:14:35.021 --> 01:14:37.822]  And I think they're going to lose in this midterm coming up.
[01:14:37.822 --> 01:14:39.802]  If they do lose, what do you expect them to do?
[01:14:39.802 --> 01:14:40.723]  I don't think they're going to give up.
[01:14:40.723 --> 01:14:41.583]  I think they're going to get even crazier.
[01:14:42.742 --> 01:14:50.088]  I think that there is, as everyone's talking about on Twitter right now, I think there's these cabal in New York, Los Angeles, and D.C.
[01:14:50.088 --> 01:14:51.269]  and they're all talking to each other.
[01:14:51.269 --> 01:15:02.499]  But if you go to anywhere outside of these major cities and talk to private citizens and women suburban voters, which I travel constantly, I interact with these people as you do, people are outraged.
[01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:10.887]  By the crap, and the character assassination, and the innuendo, and just the lack of truth in media.
[01:15:10.887 --> 01:15:16.633]  Oh, CNN's been holding town halls and panicking when all the women say Kavanaugh's innocent, even liberals.
[01:15:16.633 --> 01:15:18.295]  People are just fed up, it's so obvious.
[01:15:19.093 --> 01:15:24.938]  People are fed up by a lot and our country is entering a strange, strange territory.
[01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:27.961]  It's an inflection point in American history for sure.
[01:15:27.961 --> 01:15:32.866]  Sometimes my point is that it just takes those small visual examples.
[01:15:33.967 --> 01:15:51.437]  reality for people to say wait a second is that how these people behave they think they can't get fired for anything my tax dollars at work I mean we've got some big things coming Alex not not just on the deep state here maybe tomorrow we have to see what happens with these Kavanaugh hearings because the media is so close.
[01:15:51.437 --> 01:15:56.040]  I can't wait please join us when you do we'll all be watching at projectveritas.com thank you James O'Keefe

[01:18:58.228 --> 01:19:02.092]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:12.154]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:12.154 --> 01:19:14.115]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:14.115 --> 01:19:17.576]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.576 --> 01:19:20.197]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.197 --> 01:19:21.758]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.478 --> 01:19:34.915]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[01:19:36.061 --> 01:19:39.783]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:19:39.783 --> 01:19:40.964]  We'll win.

[01:19:51.009 --> 01:19:54.710]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:19:54.710 --> 01:19:55.931]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[01:19:55.931 --> 01:19:56.952]  We need your support.
[01:19:56.952 --> 01:20:00.734]  I'm counting on you.
[01:20:00.734 --> 01:20:03.315]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.029 --> 01:20:23.611]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:26.252]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:26.252 --> 01:20:46.102]  Alright, coming up in the next two segments, I'm gonna open the phones up on Kavanaugh, and this circus, and on Rosenstein, and the fact that they said he resigned all over the news, and that he tried to resign, but Trump wouldn't let him.
[01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:46.962]  Ha ha ha!
[01:20:48.163 --> 01:20:51.224]  Yeah, I'm not going to let you be in the driver's seat there, buddy.
[01:20:51.224 --> 01:20:53.105]  So you can then try to spin it.
[01:20:53.105 --> 01:20:55.766]  And they're so scared of these secret documents coming out.
[01:20:55.766 --> 01:21:00.028]  They're so scared of them all together scheming to take over the government, how it belongs to them.
[01:21:00.028 --> 01:21:05.810]  Because see, now that Hillary was out, they'd always worked under her.
[01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:13.313]  But now that Hillary was gone, if they could take down Trump, they could be in charge through whatever puppet they put in.
[01:21:13.313 --> 01:21:14.974]  Rosenstein could be in charge.
[01:21:16.015 --> 01:21:16.996]  Yeah, finally.
[01:21:16.996 --> 01:21:23.379]  He'd finally not just be a little corrupt, you know, guy out of a mafia district known for his corruption, known for his evil.
[01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:25.560]  He could actually be a real boy.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.962]  He could be in charge.
[01:21:27.962 --> 01:21:36.907]  Mike Adams is coming up the next hour with his powerful article, Emergency Report, Trump Planning Mass Arrest, Military Tribunals for Deep State Traitors.
[01:21:36.907 --> 01:21:41.969]  I want to have this reposted to the top of Infowars.com.
[01:21:41.969 --> 01:21:43.690]  I'm not calling for martial law.
[01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.451]  I'm not calling
[01:21:45.603 --> 01:21:47.485]  For it, but we're already under it.
[01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:50.827]  We're going to detail it, and I'm going to explain it in the next hour.
[01:21:50.827 --> 01:21:53.790]  Obama declared an emergency that's still in place.
[01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:57.453]  Trump must undo that emergency bare minimum.
[01:21:57.453 --> 01:22:01.637]  And he's moving in that direction to the globalist horror.
[01:22:01.637 --> 01:22:05.100]  Now the toll-free number to join us on this Monday edition is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:11.004]  877-789-2539.
[01:22:11.004 --> 01:22:18.688]  Let's do first-time callers or folks that called in last week that were on hold and couldn't get in.
[01:22:18.688 --> 01:22:20.449]  It's on the honor system.
[01:22:20.449 --> 01:22:21.470]  877-789-2539.
[01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:28.294]  And the other big story is up on Infowars.com.
[01:22:28.294 --> 01:22:34.457]  Big Tech has defined conservatism as hate speech.
[01:22:34.457 --> 01:22:36.178]  I worked with Paul on this article over the weekend.
[01:22:36.178 --> 01:22:36.918]  It came out today.
[01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:38.119]  My headline was
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:45.562]  Big Tech says that conservatism violates terms of service.
[01:22:45.562 --> 01:22:49.324]  But again, they just define it as hate speech and say, oh, it's hate speech.
[01:22:49.324 --> 01:22:49.804]  It's a game.
[01:22:49.804 --> 01:22:53.206]  It's like they used to go, oh, Alex Jones is wrong.
[01:22:53.206 --> 01:23:00.690]  We're calling for global governance, not government.
[01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:04.392]  Think about that.
[01:23:04.392 --> 01:23:06.453]  Well, governance means the same thing as government.
[01:23:08.601 --> 01:23:09.561]  So that's what these guys do.
[01:23:09.561 --> 01:23:18.864]  They think you're stupid, they think you're idiots, and they just can't believe all the things that they've gotten away with.
[01:23:18.864 --> 01:23:25.626]  And I do want to get to some Project Veritas videos that I mentioned as well, but we'll also just in post and upload that live video to InfoWars.com.
[01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:30.507]  We'll add those boildowns you guys did that are so important to that last video.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:42.528]  I tend to harp on the Democrats secretly planning 25th Amendment overthrow of Trump 20 months ago, and then putting it in policy papers.
[01:23:42.528 --> 01:23:47.893]  You know, before they even said it, I knew what they'd try, because I'd studied deep state operations.
[01:23:47.893 --> 01:23:53.599]  And then about a month after I said it, in January, they started saying it in February of last year.
[01:23:53.599 --> 01:23:55.961]  And now, this year, they say it publicly.
[01:23:58.086 --> 01:24:03.031]  And they say, we're not following what he says, Hillary's our president and Obama's the co-pilot.
[01:24:03.031 --> 01:24:04.872]  You've seen those statements.
[01:24:04.872 --> 01:24:18.385]  So just the belligerence of these con artists, from the corrupt congressmen and women down to the bureaucrats who think they can't be fired, they believe they are invincible.
[01:24:18.385 --> 01:24:20.067]  And that's why they've gotten so out of control.
[01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:29.501]  And it's like Thomas Jefferson said, when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:33.183]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[01:24:33.183 --> 01:24:37.125]  And the media always spins that like, oh, Jones wants to kill all the cops.
[01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:38.486]  Jones doesn't want a government.
[01:24:38.486 --> 01:24:49.071]  No, I want a limited constitutional government that protects our liberties and freedoms, not a rogue one run by arrogant SOBs like Rosenstein
[01:24:51.715 --> 01:24:56.638]  Who have no business being near the levers of power.
[01:24:56.638 --> 01:25:11.389]  Bunch of crazy lawyers, who can prosecute anybody they want, who are paid off by criminals, who rub elbows with all the gangsters, and they just get this God complex.
[01:25:11.389 --> 01:25:19.435]  And they just get away with so much, that they then think, well the media and everybody else, the Republicans and Democrats, they don't like,
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:25.301]  Trump, so we're going to wear a wire and I'm going to set him up, 25th Amendment.
[01:25:25.301 --> 01:25:27.141]  We'll just get rid of him.
[01:25:27.141 --> 01:25:32.603]  When they were pushing all that internally, it was all over the news, do it this year.
[01:25:32.603 --> 01:25:33.663]  They really tried this.
[01:25:33.663 --> 01:25:34.223]  And you know what?
[01:25:34.223 --> 01:25:35.243]  They're still trying it.
[01:25:35.243 --> 01:25:42.945]  But it's being discredited right now because the economy's come back, because Trump has stood the test and people know the truth.
[01:25:42.945 --> 01:25:44.165]  So I'm the low-hanging fruit.
[01:25:46.636 --> 01:25:48.097]  They've been unable to get rid of Trump.
[01:25:48.097 --> 01:25:57.363]  You know, there's articles out on Infowars.com where they're threatening to kill Kavanaugh's family and kill the Trump family and all the rest of it.
[01:25:57.363 --> 01:26:01.946]  But because of you standing with us, we're still on the air.
[01:26:01.946 --> 01:26:04.868]  And we've gained more AM and FM stations.
[01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:06.409]  And we've gained more TV stations.
[01:26:06.409 --> 01:26:11.412]  But they don't want us being able to spread things virally on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:26:12.093 --> 01:26:15.375]  So they've created this illusion that, oh, if you promote our stuff, you get banned.
[01:26:15.375 --> 01:26:18.157]  You're going to get banned anyways, but that's not even the truth.
[01:26:18.157 --> 01:26:23.060]  I've done dozens of big YouTube interviews with other talk show hosts that haven't been taken down.
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:24.261]  Talk about prior constraint.
[01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.002]  I could be Charlie Manson.
[01:26:26.002 --> 01:26:30.124]  You could still interview me like 60 Minutes did.
[01:26:30.124 --> 01:26:32.586]  Are they going to get taken off the air because they interviewed Charlie Manson?
[01:26:32.586 --> 01:26:33.846]  I'm not Charlie Manson.
[01:26:33.846 --> 01:26:39.030]  They want me shut off the air so they can build straw men and demonize me, and that's why
[01:26:40.049 --> 01:26:50.893]  If you want InfoWars to survive in this fight, which is such a critical, integral part to it, and don't want them to win, you've got to tell everybody you know about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:26:50.893 --> 01:26:53.134]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:26:53.134 --> 01:26:58.396]  And you've got to spread the articles and the videos via your email and by hand.
[01:26:58.396 --> 01:27:07.399]  Because we're saying things that scare the globalists because we're on target and we know how to beat them.
[01:27:07.399 --> 01:27:09.120]  And so far, we've been winning.
[01:27:10.717 --> 01:27:11.798]  Thanks to you.
[01:27:11.798 --> 01:27:13.560]  Only because of you and God's grace.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.323]  And I'm very thankful to you, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
[01:27:16.323 --> 01:27:19.866]  But now they're going after our payment processors.
[01:27:19.866 --> 01:27:27.334]  And... PayPal has even quoted the New York Times saying they're our only payment processor.
[01:27:28.558 --> 01:27:32.379]  Is that just how dumb these bureaucrats are and these corporate people are and everything else?
[01:27:32.379 --> 01:27:33.520]  And then they celebrate the newspaper.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.360]  He'll be bankrupt!
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:34.760]  Yay!
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.180]  He can't buy or sell!
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:36.521]  Yay!
[01:27:36.521 --> 01:27:37.661]  Oh, it's a private company!
[01:27:37.661 --> 01:27:41.162]  Oh, in China you can't get on airplanes or buy or sell if they don't like you, the government.
[01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:42.202]  Now it's coming here.
[01:27:42.202 --> 01:27:49.705]  It's total Martin of the Beast to control you not having access to bank accounts and life!
[01:27:49.705 --> 01:27:52.326]  The good news is PayPal's based in San Francisco.
[01:27:52.326 --> 01:27:53.466]  There are a lot of other folks.
[01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:59.788]  That are even lower priced than PayPal on the percentages they take.
[01:27:59.788 --> 01:28:02.971]  But we did it because folks have a lot of PayPal wallets.
[01:28:02.971 --> 01:28:05.353]  PayPal was a fraction.
[01:28:05.353 --> 01:28:05.934]  And you're fools.
[01:28:07.489 --> 01:28:08.629]  Now I'm just going to get on the phone.
[01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:12.850]  I've never taken big donations from wealthy folks, but people have offered.
[01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:13.870]  Now I'm just going to get on the phone.
[01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:15.551]  I'll bring sponsors back, whatever.
[01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:19.492]  But it's critical that people get these great products because they don't want you to have them.
[01:28:19.492 --> 01:28:22.913]  They want to block you from getting H2, that's on its last run.
[01:28:22.913 --> 01:28:26.473]  They want to block you getting Brain Force, the Amazing Entropic, 40% off, or Secret 12.
[01:28:26.473 --> 01:28:28.474]  It's all there at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:29.794 --> 01:28:31.816]  And we need to be strong in the face of this.
[01:28:31.816 --> 01:28:33.137]  I want to expand.
[01:28:33.137 --> 01:28:37.720]  But if we're unable to sell a lot of product and fund ourselves, they'll win.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.383]  So get some of the t-shirts for the most banned broadcasts in the world at mfortworthstore.com.

[01:28:57.737 --> 01:28:58.938]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.938 --> 01:29:04.322]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.322 --> 01:29:07.224]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:07.224 --> 01:29:10.806]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:29:27.384 --> 01:29:31.267]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:31:55.492 --> 01:31:55.512]  X2!
[01:31:59.864 --> 01:32:07.685]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[01:32:07.685 --> 01:32:14.387]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[01:32:14.387 --> 01:32:22.088]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of Jeannie and there's this purple gas.
[01:32:22.088 --> 01:32:25.389]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[01:32:25.389 --> 01:32:27.369]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:33.473]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[01:32:33.473 --> 01:32:35.175]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:36.395]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:32:36.395 --> 01:32:40.659]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[01:32:40.659 --> 01:32:45.863]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[01:32:45.863 --> 01:32:47.804]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[01:32:47.804 --> 01:32:50.466]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.

[01:32:52.288 --> 01:32:53.689]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:55.350]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:56.391]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:32:56.391 --> 01:32:57.792]  It's 25% off right now.
[01:33:01.801 --> 01:33:09.047]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.047 --> 01:33:11.188]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:11.188 --> 01:33:13.450]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.377 --> 01:33:52.063]  We are back live, about to go to your phone calls.
[01:33:52.063 --> 01:33:55.868]  And we have several other big guests joining us coming up.
[01:33:55.868 --> 01:33:58.833]  Mike Adams with the most important issue that you can possibly cover.
[01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:24.444]  I've talked to a few people involved with the Trump operation during the breaks, and I've talked to Roger Stone on-air and off-air, and the best thinking we have is that Rosenstein got really spooked by the fact that they were about to release the secret text between McCabe and he and others, where they were planning, going back to the time Trump got in, to sabotage him and remove him from office.
[01:34:24.444 --> 01:34:27.666]  So Rosenstein then said, told Kelly, that he was going to resign.
[01:34:28.815 --> 01:34:29.875]  On Friday.
[01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:32.196]  That's what Rosenstein told Bloomberg.
[01:34:32.196 --> 01:34:37.198]  But then when nothing happened and Trump didn't announce it, Trump knew they were trying to set him up.
[01:34:37.198 --> 01:34:39.980]  Trump listened to Hannity and others.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.381]  Not that he couldn't get rid of Rosenstein, but they wanted to pick the time to get rid of Rosenstein.
[01:34:44.381 --> 01:34:48.203]  And the New York Times article was accurate that Rosenstein wanted all that.
[01:34:48.203 --> 01:34:49.663]  That's been admitted.
[01:34:49.663 --> 01:34:58.147]  But they wanted to throw him overboard to again act like Trump's trying to block the Mueller probe before they release some new damning information that'll be cooked up.
[01:34:59.679 --> 01:35:10.948]  And now McCabe, even though it's admitted that Rosenstein did not get fired and isn't leaving because he couldn't trick Trump into it, is that he's panicking over Rosenstein-Ouster.
[01:35:10.948 --> 01:35:12.530]  I'm deeply concerned.
[01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:14.471]  Mueller probe at risk.
[01:35:14.471 --> 01:35:22.999]  So he's still going with the previous script, even though that is not what's happened now.
[01:35:22.999 --> 01:35:26.301]  So that's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:35:28.533 --> 01:35:31.774]  Owen had the idea to launch something like a month ago called InfoWarsArmy.
[01:35:31.774 --> 01:35:35.936]  They had the ManCow Army in Chicago.
[01:35:35.936 --> 01:35:39.178]  And that doesn't mean military operations like the media has already said.
[01:35:39.178 --> 01:35:41.098]  Some people go, oh, they'll false flag you.
[01:35:41.098 --> 01:35:43.659]  They're going to false flag us anyways.
[01:35:43.659 --> 01:35:47.601]  I can't get out of bed in the morning because somebody might try to set me up?
[01:35:47.601 --> 01:35:50.202]  That's why everybody has inaction out there.
[01:35:50.202 --> 01:35:51.623]  InfoWarsArmy.com.
[01:35:53.649 --> 01:36:08.579]  We've got a whole breakdown and videos explaining it and more on the site, but it's about citizen activism with 43 days out from the election and going to ballgames and unfurling Infowars.com banners or interstate highways or
[01:36:10.049 --> 01:36:15.532]  Calling into C-SPAN or jumping in front of live TV cameras in public squares where it's legal and lawful.
[01:36:15.532 --> 01:36:20.274]  Whatever stunt you can do that's legal and safe following local and federal laws, go out and do it.
[01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:24.015]  We'll air it here and it'll help affect the election and change things.
[01:36:24.015 --> 01:36:27.117]  And so we've already seen some citizens go to Trump events and do it.
[01:36:27.117 --> 01:36:32.880]  And we've already seen some of those things unfold, free Alex Jones rallies, you name it.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.621]  And then Owen and Dew went to a Rangers game behind home plate.
[01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:41.613]  Right when Owen decided to put the Trump mask on and jump up behind home plate, the guy hits a home run.
[01:36:41.613 --> 01:36:42.814]  Talk about the Trump effect.
[01:36:42.814 --> 01:36:43.694]  This is not made up.
[01:36:43.694 --> 01:36:44.455]  It's crazy.
[01:36:44.455 --> 01:36:45.976]  That's coming up next hour.
[01:36:45.976 --> 01:36:47.937]  Because we have the stuff with the Rangers, but...
[01:36:49.281 --> 01:36:50.202]  I had meetings earlier.
[01:36:50.202 --> 01:36:58.387]  I want to add to it the folks at Trump rallies and some of the other things that are happening in the Infowars army.
[01:36:58.387 --> 01:36:59.267]  I want to salute folks.
[01:36:59.267 --> 01:37:02.309]  But before I go to your calls, let me air this piece.
[01:37:02.309 --> 01:37:05.711]  It's a boil-down of part of my speech and other speeches.
[01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:07.832]  This was Saturday at the Free Alex Jones rally.
[01:37:07.832 --> 01:37:09.333]  I only heard about this like Wednesday.
[01:37:09.333 --> 01:37:10.314]  Joey Gibson and others.
[01:37:11.761 --> 01:37:19.144]  And so I was already down here working on Saturday, and I didn't want to be the center of attention at it, but I saw hundreds of people out there, and I thought, well, my God, I better get down there.
[01:37:19.144 --> 01:37:21.045]  And it was great.
[01:37:21.045 --> 01:37:27.468]  He gave a powerful speech that obviously the censors don't want you to see, but here's a boil down of some of that that happened Saturday.
[01:37:30.097 --> 01:37:30.417]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:30.417 --> 01:37:30.757]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:30.757 --> 01:37:30.958]  Louder!
[01:37:30.958 --> 01:37:31.098]  Louder!
[01:37:31.098 --> 01:37:31.258]  Louder!

[01:37:39.684 --> 01:37:40.004]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:40.004 --> 01:37:40.404]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:40.404 --> 01:37:41.245]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:41.245 --> 01:37:41.605]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:41.605 --> 01:37:42.025]  Free Alex Jones!

[01:37:43.086 --> 01:37:43.406]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:43.406 --> 01:37:43.726]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:43.726 --> 01:37:44.047]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:44.047 --> 01:37:44.487]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:44.487 --> 01:37:44.807]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:44.807 --> 01:37:45.408]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:45.408 --> 01:37:45.908]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:45.908 --> 01:37:46.328]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:46.328 --> 01:37:46.809]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:46.809 --> 01:37:47.229]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:48.210]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:48.670]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:49.070]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.470]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.831]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:49.831 --> 01:37:50.511]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:50.511 --> 01:37:50.932]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:50.932 --> 01:37:51.332]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:51.672]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:51.672 --> 01:37:52.232]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:52.232 --> 01:37:52.653]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:52.653 --> 01:37:53.093]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:53.093 --> 01:37:53.433]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:53.433 --> 01:37:53.773]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:53.773 --> 01:37:54.154]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:37:54.154 --> 01:37:54.454]  Free Alex Jones
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:10.243]  The answer to 1984 is 1976!
[01:38:10.243 --> 01:38:18.626]  Fellow Congressman Davy Crockett once said, you may all go to hell, and I will go to Texas!
[01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:20.226]  Read Alex Jones!
[01:38:20.226 --> 01:38:21.827]  Read Alex Jones!
[01:38:21.827 --> 01:38:22.547]  Read Alex Jones!
[01:38:23.524 --> 01:38:24.546]  You're doing a great job.
[01:38:24.546 --> 01:38:25.567]  Keep it up.
[01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:27.950]  It's important that you keep doing what you're doing.
[01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:31.034]  They're really attacking you because you're being successful.
[01:38:31.034 --> 01:38:34.679]  They say in the Air Force, you're over the target.
[01:38:34.679 --> 01:38:38.304]  You start taking flak, you're taking flak because you're over the target.
[01:38:39.165 --> 01:38:40.546]  Keep it up, Alex.
[01:38:40.546 --> 01:38:41.947]  Hey, Gay Frogs are real.
[01:38:41.947 --> 01:38:42.867]  We're here for Alex Jones.
[01:38:42.867 --> 01:38:44.148]  We're all Alex Jones.
[01:38:44.148 --> 01:38:45.869]  This isn't about Alex Jones or Donald Trump.
[01:38:45.869 --> 01:38:47.070]  This is about the truth.
[01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:48.370]  We're here to support the truth.
[01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:53.093]  We're here to support our future, and we're here to support everyone else for their free speech.
[01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:53.814]  That's it.
[01:38:53.814 --> 01:38:54.134]  We're here.
[01:38:54.134 --> 01:38:54.634]  We're out here.
[01:38:54.634 --> 01:38:55.675]  I came from Tampa, Florida.
[01:38:55.675 --> 01:38:58.476]  I drove 18 hours because I had to be a part of this.
[01:38:58.476 --> 01:38:59.497]  Thank you, Joey Gibson.
[01:38:59.497 --> 01:39:00.357]  Thank you, InfoWars.
[01:39:00.357 --> 01:39:01.538]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:39:01.538 --> 01:39:02.979]  We all love you, Alex Jones.
[01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.680]  And I noticed the other day, I heard you say the word love.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.341]  You love us.
[01:39:06.341 --> 01:39:06.961]  Keep that.
[01:39:06.961 --> 01:39:09.543]  We're not hearing any love from the left, right?
[01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:12.465]  We need to keep talking about love and how we're the love party.
[01:39:12.465 --> 01:39:15.967]  There's only two things in life, two emotions, love and fear.
[01:39:15.967 --> 01:39:18.569]  Everything else stems from that.
[01:39:18.569 --> 01:39:20.210]  So let's not be about any fear.
[01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:21.491]  Let's keep up the love, Alex.
[01:39:21.491 --> 01:39:22.571]  We love you.
[01:39:22.571 --> 01:39:23.532]  Keep it up, man.
[01:39:23.532 --> 01:39:26.254]  If you could say one thing to Alex Jones, what would it be?
[01:39:26.254 --> 01:39:28.115]  Open up an Infowars store in Austin.
[01:39:28.895 --> 01:39:31.137]  Like a physical story.
[01:39:31.137 --> 01:39:35.240]  Do not underestimate how important it is that you guys came out here today.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.483]  Whether it's Minnesota, Colorado, Washington, or wherever it may be.
[01:39:39.483 --> 01:39:41.725]  So thank you so much for coming out here today.
[01:39:41.725 --> 01:39:43.025]  And thank you so much to us.
[01:39:45.826 --> 01:39:49.107]  So, God, I just ask that you touch everybody here today.
[01:39:49.107 --> 01:40:01.311]  Touch them in their hearts, lift them up, lift their spirits, get them out of their sleep so they can go out and preach your word, preach your message, so that we can truly change this country and bring this country straight back to God.
[01:40:01.311 --> 01:40:02.912]  In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
[01:40:14.858 --> 01:40:16.679]  You folks are awesome to come out here.
[01:40:16.679 --> 01:40:18.300]  This whole impromptu thing is great.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:23.943]  But let's free America and free the world and free the internet.
[01:40:23.943 --> 01:40:25.984]  They thought they had America.
[01:40:25.984 --> 01:40:31.527]  But just like every time it's happened, it doesn't get better until the last minute of the last hour.
[01:40:31.527 --> 01:40:40.692]  And now the sleeping giants of humanity, not just here, but from areas of Europe to South America to Asia, are waking up to the authoritarian globalists.
[01:40:44.655 --> 01:40:57.768]  Just because the arrogant criminals at Google and Facebook and Twitter have already gotten away with censorship and spying on you and working with China to arrest dissidents doesn't mean they'll get away with it forever!
[01:41:00.774 --> 01:41:10.478]  And by confronting them, we got them to move early with the censorship they were planning after the election!
[01:41:10.478 --> 01:41:18.382]  And after we got them to move early, they've now been exposed, and they've now been caught lying, and there's no way they'll ever reverse course!
[01:41:21.733 --> 01:41:25.315]  So look, I'm glad that all you guys got this free Alex Jones Rally and that's awesome.
[01:41:25.315 --> 01:41:26.436]  And I'm glad you're out here.
[01:41:26.436 --> 01:41:32.460]  You notice the anti-fascist scum funded by the left isn't here.
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:35.082]  Because their terrorist funding by Soros has come out.
[01:41:35.082 --> 01:41:43.367]  And all over the country, when they come out and attack people, even in blue cities like Austin, they're getting their asses arrested because they are terrorist criminals!
[01:41:46.135 --> 01:41:52.578]  They're the terrorist criminals that want to tell us we don't have free speech, and they want to assault women and children.
[01:41:52.578 --> 01:41:54.538]  Well, guess what, ass****?
[01:41:54.538 --> 01:41:56.659]  You thought you defeated America?
[01:41:56.659 --> 01:41:57.740]  All you did was wake her up!
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:04.522]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they've got to believe they've won!
[01:42:04.522 --> 01:42:06.163]  I'm going to go back to the studio.
[01:42:06.163 --> 01:42:14.126]  I'm going to write a report to the Congress and the President.
[01:42:14.126 --> 01:42:15.387]  I'm going to take down Coop.
[01:42:15.387 --> 01:42:15.887]  God bless you.
[01:42:20.168 --> 01:42:21.910]  That's a powerful piece they put together.
[01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:23.591]  It was a nice, impromptu rally.
[01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:24.692]  A few hundred folks showed up.
[01:42:24.692 --> 01:42:25.773]  I'm very, very honored.
[01:42:25.773 --> 01:42:28.776]  And we should have some bigger rallies for free speech.
[01:42:28.776 --> 01:42:30.098]  We're going to have one coming up in D.C.
[01:42:30.098 --> 01:42:31.579]  to walk away right before the election.
[01:42:31.579 --> 01:42:33.241]  We're going to have more.
[01:42:33.241 --> 01:42:36.163]  We have to put our skin in the game, so I commend everybody.
[01:42:36.163 --> 01:42:39.927]  They just announced this thing a few days before it happened, so it was a nice crowd here in Austin.
[01:42:39.927 --> 01:42:41.328]  And the antifa scum didn't show up.
[01:42:41.328 --> 01:42:43.511]  All right, your phone calls, I promise, on the other side of this break.
[01:42:44.924 --> 01:42:47.068]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:42:47.068 --> 01:42:49.152]  You are our only hope now, listeners.
[01:42:49.152 --> 01:42:50.694]  Total censorship, total attack.
[01:42:50.694 --> 01:42:52.398]  If you spread the links, we win.
[01:42:52.398 --> 01:42:53.499]  If you don't, we will fail.
[01:42:57.113 --> 01:43:03.499]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:03.499 --> 01:43:06.722]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:10.425]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:43:10.425 --> 01:43:15.129]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:43:15.129 --> 01:43:18.392]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:43:19.273 --> 01:43:30.278]  Our Pure Tumeric Extract plus Piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:43:30.278 --> 01:43:38.801]  Regular Tumeric Root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our Tumeric Root Extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:43:40.442 --> 01:43:49.494]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:43:57.324 --> 01:44:01.289]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:44:01.289 --> 01:44:04.573]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:44:04.573 --> 01:44:10.840]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.623]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:44:14.344 --> 01:44:18.169]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:24.638]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:44:24.638 --> 01:44:29.624]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:44:30.362 --> 01:44:34.283]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:44:34.283 --> 01:44:41.484]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:46.185]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:44:46.185 --> 01:44:52.386]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:44:52.386 --> 01:44:56.347]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:58.422 --> 01:45:03.667]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:45:03.667 --> 01:45:12.354]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:45:12.354 --> 01:45:14.356]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:45:14.356 --> 01:45:17.799]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:45:17.799 --> 01:45:20.421]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:21.983]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:35.120]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, Infowars.com,
[01:45:36.283 --> 01:45:39.984]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:45:39.984 --> 01:45:41.165]  We'll win.
[01:45:41.165 --> 01:45:43.486]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[01:45:43.486 --> 01:45:49.388]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[01:45:49.388 --> 01:45:51.229]  And you're right, to the market.
[01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:54.930]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Globalist may win.
[01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:56.471]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:45:56.471 --> 01:45:57.331]  We need your support.
[01:45:57.331 --> 01:45:58.031]  I'm counting on you.
[01:45:58.031 --> 01:46:04.614]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.481]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:46:09.481 --> 01:46:18.223]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:46:18.223 --> 01:46:22.784]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:46:22.784 --> 01:46:24.224]  You are the info war.
[01:46:24.224 --> 01:46:27.765]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:46:28.445 --> 01:46:39.834]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:46:39.834 --> 01:46:47.820]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:54.866]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:54.866 --> 01:46:57.608]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:01.198 --> 01:47:09.785]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.785 --> 01:47:15.770]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:20.494]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[01:47:20.494 --> 01:47:25.298]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[01:47:26.015 --> 01:47:30.838]  He said it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[01:47:30.838 --> 01:47:33.460]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:38.184]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:47:44.498 --> 01:47:51.901]  I'm going to write your phone calls for this segment and the next.
[01:47:51.901 --> 01:47:56.784]  We'll continue with phone calls when Mike Adams joins us with the most important information we could possibly cover.
[01:47:56.784 --> 01:47:59.765]  So please, please stay with us.
[01:47:59.765 --> 01:48:04.128]  Because I'm sacrificing my name, my family, my treasure for all this because I believe in you.
[01:48:04.128 --> 01:48:09.851]  And we've seen things begin to turn around, but we're in the middle of the fight now and we need your support more than ever.
[01:48:09.851 --> 01:48:10.331]  So thank you.
[01:48:11.638 --> 01:48:12.799]  And so do our local stations.
[01:48:12.799 --> 01:48:17.221]  You just don't know how important it is to call and thank those program directors and call and thank those sponsors.
[01:48:17.221 --> 01:48:19.042]  So if you're a business, become a sponsor.
[01:48:19.042 --> 01:48:22.023]  Now's the time to get your skin in the game or never do it.
[01:48:22.023 --> 01:48:23.324]  Because they're coming for your family.
[01:48:23.324 --> 01:48:24.664]  They're coming for your freedom.
[01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:25.825]  They're coming for your wallet.
[01:48:25.825 --> 01:48:27.826]  They're coming for your religious freedom.
[01:48:27.826 --> 01:48:29.727]  They're coming for everything.
[01:48:29.727 --> 01:48:34.749]  And I want to just say this here before I go to the calls and I'm going to them.
[01:48:34.749 --> 01:48:38.491]  The globalists make these jokes and they go, look, Jones is getting defeated.
[01:48:38.491 --> 01:48:39.572]  Jones is getting banned.
[01:48:40.649 --> 01:48:43.110]  You're the ones engaged in un-American activities, not me.
[01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:46.091]  You're the pathetic authoritarians, not me.
[01:48:46.091 --> 01:48:48.811]  Oh, look, Jones, PayPal's banning him in 10 business days.
[01:48:48.811 --> 01:48:51.112]  That was Friday.
[01:48:51.112 --> 01:48:52.532]  Oh, Jones will go bankrupt now.
[01:48:52.532 --> 01:48:54.953]  We'll kick him off the air.
[01:48:54.953 --> 01:49:06.416]  You don't think in this marathon over 20-something years, 24 years on air, that a big part of me doesn't want to get knocked out of the game?
[01:49:06.416 --> 01:49:08.037]  It's like I've been in overtime for 10 years.
[01:49:09.172 --> 01:49:11.974]  But my spirit doesn't want to lose.
[01:49:11.974 --> 01:49:16.196]  So nothing they do to me does anything to me.
[01:49:16.196 --> 01:49:18.038]  It's not like I'm doing this for money or whatever.
[01:49:18.038 --> 01:49:22.620]  I'm doing it because they're bad people and have to be opposed.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:37.810]  So if you support us, if you spread the word about the broadcast, if stations pick us up, if we're able to countervail this horrible cancer that's come to America of globalism and liberalism, of this leftist ideology, then great!
[01:49:40.606 --> 01:49:45.908]  But if I get destroyed in the process of doing what's right, that's what you gotta do to be close to God.
[01:49:45.908 --> 01:49:54.511]  And that's not some goody-two-shoes, Pharisees-type statement, oh, I'm so great, I'm so good.
[01:49:54.511 --> 01:50:00.534]  It means, I can't be with the devil-worshipping pedophiles of Hollywood and the mass-murdering chi-coms.
[01:50:00.534 --> 01:50:08.857]  I mean, these people have got so much evil under their belt that my spirit recoils
[01:50:09.949 --> 01:50:14.991]  And when you recoil from the evil, you fight globalism.
[01:50:14.991 --> 01:50:18.412]  See, the recoiling is the resistance.
[01:50:18.412 --> 01:50:19.052]  That's all it is.
[01:50:19.052 --> 01:50:21.533]  It's like somebody walks in and goes, we got dinner for you.
[01:50:21.533 --> 01:50:27.176]  And they pull out a rotten dead dog and put it on the table and it stinks and it's got, you're like, I'm not going to eat that.
[01:50:27.176 --> 01:50:28.316]  I don't even want to fight him.
[01:50:28.316 --> 01:50:31.177]  He's go, eat it, eat it, eat it.
[01:50:31.177 --> 01:50:32.398]  That's what I feel like spiritually.
[01:50:32.398 --> 01:50:33.078]  It's like vomiting.
[01:50:34.296 --> 01:50:40.719]  Only the last few months, when I think about the globalists, or I see something they've done that's bad, I'll actually, I've never had in my whole life, I go vomit.
[01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:45.582]  I actually, this has happened lately.
[01:50:45.582 --> 01:50:48.504]  Pat Riley was trying to make me lift some weights, it was like a couple weeks ago.
[01:50:48.504 --> 01:50:54.967]  I'm not in great shape, I was working out, or it wasn't that I was tired, and Hillary was on screen saying something, and I literally started to throw up.
[01:50:56.690 --> 01:51:03.654]  Because it's just my body saying, get her out, get her away, get her away, get her away, get her away.
[01:51:03.654 --> 01:51:05.155]  So that's how I describe it.
[01:51:05.155 --> 01:51:19.223]  It's like you go, you're chained up, and they're like, we're going to feed you more, we're going to give you poison vaccines, we're going to give you GMO, we're going to give you world government, we're going to tell your young son he's a girl and your daughter she's a boy, and it's like you're a bunch of pervert criminals!
[01:51:19.223 --> 01:51:21.304]  Look how far you've already gotten away with it!
[01:51:21.304 --> 01:51:22.185]  What the hell!
[01:51:24.087 --> 01:51:25.508]  You think I'm worried about being banned?
[01:51:25.508 --> 01:51:27.989]  You think I'm worried about being demonized?
[01:51:27.989 --> 01:51:30.350]  No, I'm worried about them winning.
[01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:44.177]  But what's sad is to be banned off all these platforms, and then to watch mainstream media attack me, mainstream media lie about me, and then to watch it affect good people, and then to watch them get the so-called liberty movement.
[01:51:44.177 --> 01:51:48.919]  Because if you talk bad about Alex Jones on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube, why suddenly nothing gets banned?
[01:51:48.919 --> 01:51:51.421]  Why you get promoted?
[01:51:51.421 --> 01:51:53.682]  You were nobody before, but now you're somebody.
[01:51:55.219 --> 01:52:01.281]  To watch the weird ego of these people get manipulated is frightening.
[01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:06.912]  So I'm doing this because it's the right thing and I'm proud of what I've done.
[01:52:06.912 --> 01:52:09.935]  But they're coming at us because we do know how to beat them.
[01:52:09.935 --> 01:52:11.576]  We do have their number.
[01:52:11.576 --> 01:52:17.300]  So I'm just trying to point out again, we talk about COG and martial law and overthrowing the president.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.881]  Remember, you heard all that here first.
[01:52:18.881 --> 01:52:20.302]  It's all over the news now.
[01:52:20.302 --> 01:52:21.943]  That's why we're banned.
[01:52:21.943 --> 01:52:26.046]  They don't want us to tell you the next step and the next step as we watch them.
[01:52:30.336 --> 01:52:37.602]  Why, frankly, InfoWars and our whole crew and our guests and everything we do is a national asset.
[01:52:37.602 --> 01:52:39.744]  And it's a human asset.
[01:52:39.744 --> 01:52:41.305]  We are pro-human.
[01:52:41.305 --> 01:52:44.287]  We believe in humanity.
[01:52:44.287 --> 01:52:52.814]  And they know that if you have the choice of picking humanity and a human future versus a globalist, transhumanist robot future, you'll pick humanity.
[01:52:52.814 --> 01:52:57.758]  So they just want to remove us from the marketplace because they know you want what we're doing.
[01:53:00.250 --> 01:53:12.283]  There's so many losers that want to feel like they're winners, that they will then attack InfoWars or do that because they think finally they're being accepted, finally they're part of the power structure.
[01:53:12.283 --> 01:53:14.565]  No, you're losing your soul.
[01:53:14.565 --> 01:53:19.931]  And I mourn for you, not that you lie about me and attack me, but that you've made the wrong decision.
[01:53:25.111 --> 01:53:26.292]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:53:26.292 --> 01:53:34.759]  We got Jessica and Miles and Mark and Matthew and Eric and Ann and David and Duncan and Eddie and Kamal and David.
[01:53:34.759 --> 01:53:37.061]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:53:37.061 --> 01:53:39.183]  Is it Ann?
[01:53:39.183 --> 01:53:42.106]  Is it Jessica?
[01:53:42.106 --> 01:53:44.288]  We'll go to Jessica and then Ann first.
[01:53:44.288 --> 01:53:45.549]  So we'll go to Jessica in Florida.
[01:53:45.549 --> 01:53:46.510]  Jessica, thanks for calling.
[01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:48.692]  Go ahead.
[01:53:48.692 --> 01:53:49.993]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:53:49.993 --> 01:53:50.854]  Thank you for calling.
[01:53:50.854 --> 01:53:51.174]  Welcome.
[01:53:52.728 --> 01:53:53.249]  Thanks.
[01:53:53.249 --> 01:54:01.736]  You know, I was calling because I have encountered a lot of political propaganda in my daughter's school, and she's in a charter school down here.
[01:54:01.736 --> 01:54:10.605]  It's only about 100 kids in K-8, and they are plugging Times for Kids and Scholastic.
[01:54:10.605 --> 01:54:13.387]  And these articles are over the top.
[01:54:13.387 --> 01:54:16.350]  I mean, we're talking gun control with Emma Gonzalez in there.
[01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:16.970]  We're talking
[01:54:18.422 --> 01:54:25.488]  Even the principal's husband I'm friends with on Facebook, and he posts things about support for the DSA.
[01:54:25.488 --> 01:54:27.349]  And it just, it blows me away.
[01:54:27.349 --> 01:54:36.696]  We actually just lost our math teacher for 7th and 8th grade so that we could pay for a security officer because the state of Florida is now requiring that.
[01:54:36.696 --> 01:54:42.581]  And it just blows me away that the propaganda that's in classes, it's really where the censorship starts.
[01:54:42.581 --> 01:54:47.545]  It's to train these kids in the way that they think, so that as they become college students,
[01:54:48.235 --> 01:54:52.582]  Or, you know, further along, that they've already been brainwashed to do so.
[01:54:52.582 --> 01:54:59.674]  Oh, the social engineers, the leftists are making their move, and Austin next year...
[01:55:00.848 --> 01:55:04.551]  is going to tell boys and girls, don't say boys and girls, that's a new dirty word.
[01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:11.276]  Imagine in a science fiction book, in 2018, in Texas, you can't say boy or girls in elementary.
[01:55:11.276 --> 01:55:16.801]  They are literally going to screw over kids, that I'm a girl, I'm a boy, I'm bad.
[01:55:16.801 --> 01:55:27.009]  The child abuse, the sexual abuse, the pervertedness of it, and we just, but we just, oh we're liberal, we're gonna do what you say, and it's all a scientific program
[01:55:28.393 --> 01:55:29.753]  To take over society.
[01:55:29.753 --> 01:55:36.195]  I've been told, don't criticize transhumanism, don't criticize open borders, don't criticize Islam.
[01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:37.715]  Because that's globalism.
[01:55:37.715 --> 01:55:39.276]  And that's their plan.
[01:55:39.276 --> 01:55:41.156]  The sexualization is another thing.
[01:55:41.156 --> 01:55:45.217]  They are now, strongly this year, implementing their dress code.
[01:55:45.217 --> 01:55:50.419]  So I have my 12-year-old coming home telling me, oh, you know, I got in trouble because my shorts are too short.
[01:55:50.419 --> 01:55:51.759]  We're 12!
[01:55:51.759 --> 01:55:53.900]  You know, and who, why are our girls
[01:55:55.512 --> 01:56:01.138]  being picked on for possibly being, uh, what, distractive to little boys?
[01:56:01.138 --> 01:56:01.919]  Give me a break.
[01:56:01.919 --> 01:56:04.302]  Well, see, that's the pervertedness of the school.
[01:56:04.302 --> 01:56:11.289]  They take all of our Christian inclinations and twist them to then make children feel dirty when they're 10 or 11 years old.
[01:56:11.289 --> 01:56:11.690]  Exactly.
[01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:13.612]  And it's all... Let me tell you something.
[01:56:13.832 --> 01:56:20.480]  Public schools have a lot of good people and everything else, but a good portion, a large minority, are perverts.
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:24.144]  And the religion of government and the left is pedophilia.
[01:56:24.144 --> 01:56:29.330]  And so that's how they get it going, is they want to tell your kids about what sex they are.
[01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:31.252]  They want to tell your kids they're perverts.
[01:56:31.252 --> 01:56:33.234]  They want to push Prozac and Ritalin on your kids.
[01:56:33.234 --> 01:56:33.715]  They want
[01:56:34.235 --> 01:56:37.398]  To vampirically F your kids over.
[01:56:37.398 --> 01:56:43.563]  That's their, they get power and currency from their force by hurting children.
[01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:43.983]  Is that clear?
[01:56:43.983 --> 01:56:47.226]  I absolutely agree.
[01:56:47.226 --> 01:56:51.750]  And they're the only ones, it's the adults that are planting the spot in these kids.
[01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:53.411]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ma'am.
[01:56:53.411 --> 01:56:54.933]  They started death education in 2000.
[01:56:54.933 --> 01:56:56.013]  By 2003, even, even ABC
[01:56:59.944 --> 01:57:04.873]  2020 did a special, it was 2020 ABC, that tripled suicides.
[01:57:04.873 --> 01:57:11.105]  You start teaching kids don't take your shoelace and put it around your neck and hang it in the stall and all of a sudden little girls went and did it!
[01:57:12.594 --> 01:57:18.356]  Right, yeah, well it's just like the war on drugs, you know, or bullying, you know, bullying awareness in schools.
[01:57:18.356 --> 01:57:23.297]  Why are we not focusing on the positive opposite, about building friendships, building kindness?
[01:57:23.297 --> 01:57:29.079]  Oh, most public schools don't let you play dodgeball or tag or even shake hands or hug people, exactly, no.
[01:57:29.079 --> 01:57:37.082]  It's psychological warfare, preying on your children and hiring the very, all these women accusing Kavanaugh are psychologists.
[01:57:37.902 --> 01:57:39.104]  God bless you, Jessica.
[01:57:39.104 --> 01:57:41.428]  Listen, your children will rebel against it.
[01:57:41.428 --> 01:57:44.774]  Generation Z is totally waking up, but just let them know the truth.
[01:57:44.774 --> 01:57:46.556]  They trust you, their mother, not them.

[02:00:17.614 --> 02:00:21.225]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:21.225 --> 02:00:22.569]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:33.065 --> 02:00:36.387]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls now.
[02:00:36.387 --> 02:00:39.668]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ann in California.
[02:00:39.668 --> 02:00:42.149]  Ann, thanks for calling in on this Monday edition.
[02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.389]  Thank you.
[02:01:00.731 --> 02:01:02.312]  Yeah, hi Alex, can you hear me?
[02:01:02.312 --> 02:01:04.053]  I can, thanks for calling.
[02:01:04.053 --> 02:01:05.333]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:05.333 --> 02:01:08.675]  I'm not only in California, I'm in San Francisco, California.
[02:01:08.675 --> 02:01:15.338]  Wow, so you're in the big tech censorship, pro-China, pro-communism command base.
[02:01:15.338 --> 02:01:20.841]  That's right, and I own a house cleaning company, a high-end house cleaning company.
[02:01:20.841 --> 02:01:26.504]  And the interesting thing is, is that I've been into every one of these, like, techies
[02:01:27.282 --> 02:01:28.242]  Home.
[02:01:28.242 --> 02:01:31.524]  And I have their keys as well, but that's beside the point.
[02:01:31.524 --> 02:01:32.344]  I just wanted one.
[02:01:32.344 --> 02:01:34.805]  No, no, I'd love to hear that off record.
[02:01:34.805 --> 02:01:36.306]  It's interesting.
[02:01:36.306 --> 02:01:37.346]  It's interesting.
[02:01:37.346 --> 02:01:38.027]  It's interesting.
[02:01:38.027 --> 02:01:38.947]  You got plenty of time.
[02:01:38.947 --> 02:01:43.089]  I mean, you called in about him for his army and band and all the rest of it.
[02:01:43.089 --> 02:01:50.812]  But from what I know about these big tech heads, the little liberal fake front of a wimpy guy is a camouflage for something very predatory.
[02:01:52.774 --> 02:01:53.734]  It is, it is.
[02:01:53.734 --> 02:02:03.896]  I actually have the account to clean, like Facebook has a corporate suite in the Infinity Tower, and I go when they entertain people, I have that cleaning account.
[02:02:03.896 --> 02:02:17.159]  So by me stepping up, and let me just thank you for red-pilling me, because I was a crazy-ass liberal until I heard Alex Jones and your show, and David Knight and Owen Schroer.
[02:02:17.159 --> 02:02:20.360]  But the first and most pertinent thing is that I
[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:24.803]  I have done nothing, like, publicly.
[02:02:24.803 --> 02:02:27.165]  My Twitter account is shut down.
[02:02:27.165 --> 02:02:29.266]  I want to be part of the Infowars army.
[02:02:29.266 --> 02:02:32.029]  I was one of the first responders.
[02:02:32.029 --> 02:02:39.095]  And Owen Schroyer says, to hook up with other people, go on Twitter and find someone in your area.
[02:02:39.095 --> 02:02:49.304]  I want one other conservative, just one other person, who's willing to take... I'm also an artist, so I've created some political pieces.
[02:02:50.064 --> 02:02:54.746]  To go and go with me, just one person in the Bay Area to go see.
[02:02:54.746 --> 02:02:58.048]  Well that's why they want to use social media control is not let us get together.
[02:02:58.048 --> 02:03:04.751]  Shosho, I don't want to get you in trouble and you kind of mentioned a lot of what the work you're doing so they may come after you, but I don't want you to get into specifics.
[02:03:04.751 --> 02:03:11.814]  It's just how can people, you know, they're trying to block email or how can people, you know, get a hold of you if they want to come do something with you?
[02:03:12.443 --> 02:03:14.264]  Well, OK, I went on.
[02:03:14.264 --> 02:03:17.786]  I just think that this is a very important point.
[02:03:17.786 --> 02:03:22.769]  I'm going to lose my business, but I have a little rental income and that's fine.
[02:03:22.769 --> 02:03:24.930]  You've stepped up to the plate.
[02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.171]  But it's not just you.
[02:03:26.171 --> 02:03:36.337]  It's it's patriotism, patriots throughout history who have literally laid their life down in order for us to have these freedoms.
[02:03:36.337 --> 02:03:36.537]  Now,
[02:03:37.848 --> 02:03:46.733]  Some of, I think, the most active individuals are going to be the people like myself, who were very, very liberal, and then get red-pilled.
[02:03:46.733 --> 02:03:48.094]  And I want to be clear.
[02:03:48.094 --> 02:03:51.056]  I think it's because you're still liberal, you're not a leftist.
[02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:51.936]  I keep saying liberal.
[02:03:51.936 --> 02:03:53.317]  There's liberal and there's leftists.
[02:03:53.317 --> 02:03:54.798]  The leftists are not liberals.
[02:03:54.798 --> 02:03:57.039]  So I keep using the term liberal should be leftist.
[02:03:57.039 --> 02:03:58.040]  I'm the one that's at fault.
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.662]  Have you seen Prager use a breakdown of liberal versus leftist?
[02:04:03.129 --> 02:04:06.893]  I haven't, but I... Well, it's liberals that built this country.
[02:04:06.893 --> 02:04:09.416]  It's not leftists, and that's how they've infused it.
[02:04:09.416 --> 02:04:12.178]  So I'm not correcting you, I'm correcting myself.
[02:04:12.178 --> 02:04:15.242]  Okay, well, I was a leftist, extreme leftist.
[02:04:15.242 --> 02:04:22.049]  My daughter, who's a major Bay Area social justice warrior, said she'd never talk to me again if I voted for Trump.
[02:04:22.731 --> 02:04:25.615]  So, yeah, there's things to lose here.
[02:04:38.951 --> 02:04:45.561]  With Matt Bracken, and I want to get his take on this, but we're already under martial law for the Stay Behind Network.
[02:04:45.561 --> 02:04:51.450]  I don't want martial law, but how does Trump stop a deep state that's already launched a civil emergency?
[02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:52.972]  We'll talk about it all straight ahead.
[02:04:52.972 --> 02:04:54.495]  This is critical.
[02:04:56.445 --> 02:04:58.766]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[02:06:09.039 --> 02:06:14.824]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[02:06:14.824 --> 02:06:18.006]  Something you call love but confess.
[02:06:21.408 --> 02:06:32.473]  Alright, coming up next segment, Mike Adams has said emergency report, Trump planning mass arrest, military tribunals for deep state traders.
[02:06:32.473 --> 02:06:36.695]  It's not that we brought us to that point, that's, they're trying to overthrow the government.
[02:06:36.695 --> 02:06:48.181]  So how do you respond to, these aren't like regular bank robbers or regular child molesters, these are people in the FBI, in the CIA, in the Congress, in the media, that are planning total insurrection.
[02:06:48.181 --> 02:06:49.042]  So how do you counter that?
[02:06:49.864 --> 02:06:53.147]  I'm an expert on martial law.
[02:06:53.147 --> 02:06:54.228]  Clinton was trying to gear it up.
[02:06:54.228 --> 02:06:59.273]  I learned about it from federal employees and people, so that's why I was worried about it.
[02:06:59.273 --> 02:07:02.035]  People go, oh God, Jones used to be against martial law, now he loves it.
[02:07:02.035 --> 02:07:02.996]  No, I don't.
[02:07:02.996 --> 02:07:04.777]  Obama put us under it.
[02:07:04.777 --> 02:07:06.059]  It's coming up next segment.
[02:07:06.059 --> 02:07:12.124]  Anne, in California, you were saying that you work in and around Silicon Valley and see these people.
[02:07:12.124 --> 02:07:13.525]  You're talking about your daughters at SJW.
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:20.041]  And that she'd never talk to you again if she knew that you were going to vote for Trump since you recently woke up.
[02:07:20.041 --> 02:07:21.702]  Does she know what's going on?
[02:07:21.702 --> 02:07:24.843]  Because I mean, Trump's a classical liberal, not a leftist.
[02:07:24.843 --> 02:07:27.744]  Trump's all about freedom and openness and largesse.
[02:07:27.744 --> 02:07:32.425]  I mean, does she know that you've taken the red pill?
[02:07:32.425 --> 02:07:32.585]  Nope.
[02:07:35.033 --> 02:07:36.235]  Nobody does.
[02:07:36.235 --> 02:07:37.236]  Nobody does.
[02:07:37.236 --> 02:07:40.000]  But I'm ready to come out of the closet.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.004]  I'm ready, like I said, I have some rental income.
[02:07:43.004 --> 02:07:46.969]  I'm ready to forfeit my, it's called Hannah's High End House Cleaning.
[02:07:46.969 --> 02:07:49.393]  Ah, ma'am, I'm not gonna get you in trouble.
[02:07:49.813 --> 02:07:51.314]  We're going to delete that, delay that.
[02:08:21.918 --> 02:08:24.022]  Well, it is as bad as you say.
[02:08:24.022 --> 02:08:27.931]  My daughter, she lives in Oakland, California, and Oakland is a whole lot worse.
[02:08:28.681 --> 02:08:44.296]  San Francisco's recently, the hotels have stomped on the homeless, so they forced the politicians to move the homeless out of the main tourist area.
[02:08:44.296 --> 02:08:53.224]  But Alex, I was in Union Square in San Francisco, which is a major tourist destination, and I was ready to get on our subway BART.
[02:08:54.331 --> 02:09:10.000]  And there was a person just shooting up a hypodermic needle and the police officer, I just witnessed the police officer say, okay, buddy, move it along, move it along, you know, not here, but there was no arrest or whatever.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.662]  And, you know, probably they're opening up safe injection sites.
[02:09:16.165 --> 02:09:22.492]  Leftist cities are vampiric centers for pedophilia, heroin addicts, just death.
[02:09:22.492 --> 02:09:28.138]  And they're leftist areas to feed on all this and then use all the social service money.
[02:09:29.093 --> 02:09:30.914]  To make the politicians rich.
[02:09:30.914 --> 02:09:32.496]  And God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:09:32.496 --> 02:09:35.738]  Go to Infowarsarmy.com, send your email.
[02:09:35.738 --> 02:09:41.262]  All you gotta do is go put up a sign in public, or do something legal and lawful, and we'd love to try to work with you.
[02:09:41.262 --> 02:09:45.265]  I'm planning some prize money, too, because that made people so excited in 2016.
[02:09:45.265 --> 02:09:46.186]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:09:46.186 --> 02:09:48.147]  And I understand your excitement.
[02:09:48.147 --> 02:09:51.290]  But let's be careful not to dox you.
[02:09:52.649 --> 02:09:52.809]  Alex.
[02:09:52.809 --> 02:09:53.250]  Hey Alex.
[02:10:22.972 --> 02:10:24.813]  Hey, I got a question.
[02:10:24.813 --> 02:10:31.898]  When Rosenstein walked up to the White House like he did earlier, how come they just don't arrest him?
[02:10:31.898 --> 02:10:32.939]  They know he's a traitor.
[02:10:32.939 --> 02:10:35.821]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:10:37.441 --> 02:10:43.766]  They know that there's the illusion that he's this Justice Department person that the media worships.
[02:10:43.766 --> 02:10:48.871]  So they know Rosenstein already tried to quit to trick Trump into firing him.
[02:10:48.871 --> 02:10:52.554]  And so they're playing these super weird games right now.
[02:10:52.554 --> 02:10:55.997]  And so I think Trump did the right thing going, oh no, you're my buddy!
[02:10:55.997 --> 02:11:01.782]  You know, you resigned, the whole corporate media said you were gone, then you spun it that I fired you.
[02:11:01.782 --> 02:11:03.903]  It just shows the disarray of these people.
[02:11:03.903 --> 02:11:05.164]  You know, you ever heard the term
[02:11:06.095 --> 02:11:09.818]  You can't con an honest man, because they don't listen to scams.
[02:11:09.818 --> 02:11:11.519]  And that's how Trump is.
[02:11:11.519 --> 02:11:13.020]  None of it even works on him.
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:15.021]  He instantly sees through it.
[02:11:15.021 --> 02:11:18.164]  And so that's why all these lesser men say Trump's this idiot.
[02:11:18.164 --> 02:11:25.249]  No, because these people couldn't wipe their own white asses if it wasn't for being part of the establishment.
[02:11:26.747 --> 02:11:29.790]  Yeah, but the two sets of laws have got to stop.
[02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:38.678]  Somebody, if he doesn't take a stand, I've called the White House and I've told that lady that answers the phone that we got his back.
[02:11:38.678 --> 02:11:39.879]  Listen, Trump knows.
[02:11:39.879 --> 02:11:41.021]  Trump knows.
[02:11:41.021 --> 02:11:41.741]  Trump knows.
[02:11:41.741 --> 02:11:43.323]  That's why he's about to release the documents.
[02:11:43.323 --> 02:11:44.224]  They panicked.
[02:11:44.224 --> 02:11:46.986]  He gave them a week not to release them and now they're already freaking out.
[02:11:46.986 --> 02:11:47.407]  He has
[02:11:48.803 --> 02:11:50.525]  He has them dead to rights.
[02:11:50.525 --> 02:11:56.009]  These criminals are so arrogant, it's their mental illness, that they thought they ruled America.
[02:11:56.009 --> 02:12:08.000]  Even though their witch queen Hillary was gone and Obama was gone, they had stay-behind networks and funding through the Justice Department and CIA and through the Board of Governors of the FCC.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.702]  So they believe they've got political power.
[02:12:10.702 --> 02:12:14.946]  Trump's showing they don't have real power to all the stay-behind networks right now.
[02:12:15.606 --> 02:12:17.847]  And don't worry, it's not just Project Veritas.
[02:12:17.847 --> 02:12:24.248]  As I told the New York Times a month ago, there's new video of big tech admitting censorship coming out.
[02:12:24.248 --> 02:12:26.728]  And it's not just Veritas that's doing it now.
[02:12:26.728 --> 02:12:31.089]  Patriots, now that they've pulled this on Trump the last few months, there's been a total release.
[02:12:31.089 --> 02:12:34.170]  And I'll go ahead and let them know because they already know.
[02:12:34.170 --> 02:12:39.711]  Trump has now released the military and the Patriots that are in the intelligence agencies on these people.
[02:12:39.711 --> 02:12:43.232]  So they're all being recorded, they're all being taped, they're all being set up right now.
[02:12:44.136 --> 02:12:48.197]  And like, you get around a conservative or a patriot, we're all about doing nothing wrong.
[02:12:48.197 --> 02:12:52.879]  You get around a leftist, their religion is being dirty and talking crap.
[02:12:52.879 --> 02:12:55.979]  You wonder how they can be so arrogant, like, I'll screw everyone over.
[02:12:55.979 --> 02:12:58.240]  Oh, F America!
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:00.101]  You're like, God, what the hell?
[02:13:00.101 --> 02:13:01.801]  That's who these people are.
[02:13:01.801 --> 02:13:04.842]  Imagine the worst people you know giving power.
[02:13:05.888 --> 02:13:07.910]  And so, all you gotta do is go tape them.
[02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:12.594]  We've got enough poison, politically, to destroy their whole system.
[02:13:12.594 --> 02:13:14.336]  Do we want to have to use it?
[02:13:14.336 --> 02:13:18.159]  And, we probably are going to.
[02:13:18.159 --> 02:13:19.761]  So, don't worry.
[02:13:19.761 --> 02:13:25.666]  The lethal injection for the Democrats, the needles are already loaded up, man, politically.
[02:13:25.666 --> 02:13:30.311]  So, you want to see them burn?
[02:13:30.311 --> 02:13:31.592]  We don't want to make this messy.
[02:13:33.627 --> 02:13:35.628]  If they want a mess, they're going to get one.
[02:13:35.628 --> 02:13:37.888]  Obama and all these co-kids.
[02:13:37.888 --> 02:13:42.330]  I mean, you know, Obama having sex with 10 dudes a day and like all the cocaine he uses.
[02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:45.370]  A total addict, a total mental patient.
[02:13:45.370 --> 02:13:49.952]  And he can barely talk now, like Bill Clinton, another child rapist.
[02:13:49.952 --> 02:13:51.312]  I mean, Obama doesn't rape kids, I'm told.
[02:13:51.312 --> 02:13:53.133]  He just likes 10 dudes a day, which is fine.
[02:13:53.133 --> 02:13:57.994]  The point is the cocaine and the drugs Obama takes, he's fried.
[02:13:57.994 --> 02:13:59.695]  And so he's just to the end of his rope.
[02:13:59.695 --> 02:14:00.895]  You know how that works.
[02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:05.316]  Alex, can I tell you one quick story?
[02:14:05.316 --> 02:14:09.318]  Yes, Eddie, go ahead.
[02:14:09.318 --> 02:14:12.139]  I have your pocket Constitution.
[02:14:12.139 --> 02:14:14.360]  I carry it with me.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:19.282]  And I highlighted the emoluments section in it.
[02:14:19.282 --> 02:14:21.543]  And I gave it to my boss at work.
[02:14:21.543 --> 02:14:28.566]  And she literally stood up in a meeting, took the Constitution and threw it up against the wall and said,
[02:14:29.412 --> 02:14:34.081]  Trump shouldn't be allowed to own his own businesses while he's the president.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:37.701]  And I just thought that was crazy and I wanted to tell you.
[02:14:37.701 --> 02:14:44.384]  Did you say, hey, Hillary got billions of dollars trading favors while the head of the State Department with her foundation.
[02:14:44.384 --> 02:14:45.004]  That's OK?
[02:14:45.004 --> 02:14:48.346]  Or stealing billions from the Haitians?
[02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:52.988]  Or Bono keeps 99% of the African aid money?
[02:14:52.988 --> 02:14:59.131]  I mean, if I was running an African aid charity and I took any money for it, I'd feel bad.
[02:14:59.131 --> 02:15:00.351]  Sure, you've got to pay for the charity.
[02:15:00.351 --> 02:15:01.792]  I mean, it might even be half the expenses.
[02:15:04.153 --> 02:15:10.039]  If I was at dinner on an African charity or anything else, and I was paying for dinner off the charity, I'd feel bad.
[02:15:10.039 --> 02:15:12.321]  I mean, what a jerk, man!
[02:15:12.321 --> 02:15:13.962]  But they hold him up like he's God.
[02:15:13.962 --> 02:15:14.543]  What do you say to that?
[02:15:16.019 --> 02:15:19.801]  Oh man, I said the same thing to her.
[02:15:19.801 --> 02:15:23.183]  I said, you let all these criminals steal.
[02:15:23.183 --> 02:15:25.584]  And she's just a big lib.
[02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:26.384]  Do you understand?
[02:15:26.384 --> 02:15:30.787]  They feel their personal power through the media and the system.
[02:15:30.787 --> 02:15:32.708]  Because they have something spiritually missing.
[02:15:32.708 --> 02:15:34.609]  Thank God you get it.
[02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:36.230]  Because seriously, none of us are perfect.
[02:15:36.230 --> 02:15:37.350]  But we get justice.
[02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:38.331]  We get fraud.
[02:15:38.331 --> 02:15:40.632]  We get where we are in the universe.
[02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:42.673]  And we see it.
[02:15:42.673 --> 02:15:44.214]  These people don't get it.
[02:15:44.214 --> 02:15:44.714]  They're lost.
[02:15:45.896 --> 02:15:48.918]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams with the biggest news ever.
[02:15:48.918 --> 02:15:51.719]  43 days out from the election.
[02:15:51.719 --> 02:15:52.760]  This is why they banned us.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:55.161]  You don't want to hear, you don't want to stop this information.
[02:15:55.161 --> 02:15:57.782]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[02:16:55.905 --> 02:16:57.645]  Let's talk tough.
[02:16:57.645 --> 02:16:59.046]  Let's talk comfort.
[02:16:59.046 --> 02:17:01.426]  Let's talk about down-home value.

[02:17:06.368 --> 02:17:07.248]  Remember?
[02:17:07.248 --> 02:17:15.890]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:17:15.890 --> 02:17:19.411]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[02:17:45.296 --> 02:17:45.676]  Others don't.
[02:17:56.377 --> 02:17:58.738]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:17:58.738 --> 02:18:05.300]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[02:18:56.099 --> 02:19:05.404]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[02:19:05.404 --> 02:19:12.108]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[02:19:12.108 --> 02:19:18.952]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I Dream of Jeannie in this.
[02:19:18.952 --> 02:19:19.833]  It's purple gas.
[02:19:19.833 --> 02:19:23.114]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:19:23.114 --> 02:19:25.096]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[02:19:26.136 --> 02:19:28.517]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[02:19:28.517 --> 02:19:30.177]  Ordered it six months ago.
[02:19:30.177 --> 02:19:31.177]  So I get the price down.
[02:19:31.177 --> 02:19:32.878]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:19:32.878 --> 02:19:34.098]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:19:34.098 --> 02:19:36.038]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:19:36.038 --> 02:19:38.379]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:19:38.379 --> 02:19:42.120]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:43.580]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:45.261]  It'll be gone in a couple months.

[02:19:59.206 --> 02:20:01.812]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.787 --> 02:20:24.054]  Mike Adams and I are going to be co-hosting Into the Next Hour with former Navy SEAL and counterterrorism expert
[02:20:34.421 --> 02:20:37.523]  Matt Bracken joins us, but we're going to commandeer part of that hour.
[02:20:37.523 --> 02:20:38.283]  He's ready for that.
[02:20:38.283 --> 02:20:38.743]  It's okay.
[02:20:38.743 --> 02:20:40.104]  So I want to continue with your calls.
[02:20:40.104 --> 02:20:42.065]  We're going to finish this before I go back to your calls.
[02:20:42.065 --> 02:20:42.825]  So please be patient.
[02:20:42.825 --> 02:20:43.926]  I want to hear from you.
[02:20:43.926 --> 02:20:46.527]  This is out of NBC News.
[02:20:46.527 --> 02:20:48.568]  It's out of Daily Caller.
[02:20:48.568 --> 02:20:52.610]  Kavanaugh vows last-minute character assassinations will not force him to withdraw.
[02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:53.270]  And that's key.
[02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:56.212]  In America and in jurisprudence after the Magna Carta,
[02:20:56.932 --> 02:21:10.085]  But also, in Judaic Old Testament law, not Talmudic, but the earlier stuff that I actually agree with, Old Testament things and New Testament, you are innocent until proven guilty.
[02:21:10.085 --> 02:21:14.490]  Well, also, both women's witnesses have instantly said none of it's true.
[02:21:14.490 --> 02:21:15.451]  That's called impeached.
[02:21:16.681 --> 02:21:18.281]  But we're told, oh no, go ahead with this.
[02:21:18.281 --> 02:21:32.265]  So, this is a big moment for America, because as Mike Adams said in his emergency report that came out yesterday that's gone viral, Kavanaugh is needed for the real majority, because we can't trust one of those members.
[02:21:32.265 --> 02:21:44.409]  If Trump, and they're pulling a bunch of stuff and trying to get him out of there during an emergency, Trump needs Kavanaugh, who is a strict constructionist, and who has said he backs the co-equal executive.
[02:21:45.336 --> 02:21:48.938]  Which I back that as well, and I want to be clear.
[02:21:48.938 --> 02:22:03.885]  I'm an expert on martial law, continuity of government, national emergencies, civil emergencies, War Powers Act 33, National Security Act 47, because I learned that Obama was planning to use it, but also so was Bill Clinton.
[02:22:03.885 --> 02:22:10.448]  The difference is they signed executive orders, we're going to cover those in a moment, sheeting power to bureaucracies to block Trump.
[02:22:12.426 --> 02:22:20.568]  And so, I knew they had executive orders, I knew they had to stay behind network, I knew they were trying 25th Amendment, which everything you heard us say 20 months ago is now all over the news.
[02:22:20.568 --> 02:22:22.368]  Tomorrow's news today, next year's news today.
[02:22:22.368 --> 02:22:23.469]  That's why they want to span.
[02:22:23.469 --> 02:22:35.471]  But when Mike Adams had the headline, I talked to him the day he was writing it, I think it was Friday or Saturday, it came out on Sunday, Emergency Report, Trump Planning Mass Arrest of Military Tribunals for Deep State Traitors.
[02:22:35.471 --> 02:22:37.772]  And I went, and it made me click, I went, wait a minute.
[02:22:38.988 --> 02:22:40.950]  We're already in a civil emergency.
[02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:46.275]  Trump's the only president since the War Powers Act who hasn't declared a yearly emergency to get around things.
[02:22:46.275 --> 02:22:49.759]  He used his executive power to kill TPP and they called him a dictator.
[02:22:49.759 --> 02:22:51.180]  Well, why'd they give him that power?
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:53.022]  They gave it to Obama.
[02:22:53.022 --> 02:22:55.904]  By Obama, his last four years, he had been made a dictator.
[02:22:56.505 --> 02:22:57.926]  For all intents and purposes.
[02:22:57.926 --> 02:22:59.687]  A rubber stamp for the globalists.
[02:22:59.687 --> 02:23:10.534]  Trump taking control freaked him out so bad because if he realized his power it was over, he could shut down the emergency, restore the republic as he said at the inauguration, and step back towards Washington 2.0 and even greater.
[02:23:10.534 --> 02:23:13.156]  The greatest president in a first term.
[02:23:13.156 --> 02:23:15.838]  So destiny's happening and I'm getting chills.
[02:23:15.838 --> 02:23:23.002]  So they're going to spin this that we're calling for martial law, but I like the fact that you said it up front, because if you're already under civil emergency,
[02:23:23.823 --> 02:23:31.270]  If you're already under national emergency, with all the Brennan and Clapper and Mudd calling for 25th Amendment and we learned Rosesy's trying it...
[02:23:32.816 --> 02:23:36.097]  How do you counter a rogue cancer that's outside of law?
[02:23:36.097 --> 02:23:36.897]  That's martial law.
[02:23:36.897 --> 02:23:38.377]  Martial law is outside of regular law.
[02:23:38.377 --> 02:23:39.277]  That's the definition.
[02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:40.738]  That's the definition of martial law.
[02:23:40.738 --> 02:23:44.658]  Outside of the national laws of a country, generally meaning military rule.
[02:23:44.658 --> 02:23:51.280]  Well, they're trying to get the bureaucracy, the Praetorian Guard, the FBI and CIA to counterman the president, to overthrow him.
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:52.400]  So how do you respond?
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:58.701]  I think Trump taking the safety off on the constitutional assault weapon, and I mean that as an allegory, not literal,
[02:24:00.074 --> 02:24:06.020]  And in saying, I'll release all the secret documents of your treason, the big dog just got off the porch.
[02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:08.182]  So we're not calling for martial law.
[02:24:08.182 --> 02:24:13.066]  We're under a form of it in their own admissions under Obama's executive orders.
[02:24:13.066 --> 02:24:14.327]  We'll cover next segment.
[02:24:14.327 --> 02:24:17.370]  I want to give the big 35,000 foot view here because my
[02:24:18.542 --> 02:24:21.203]  Rarely have I had such a quantum jump.
[02:24:21.203 --> 02:24:25.866]  At first going, what, what, then I, you told me, then I read your article, I was like, of course, that's true.
[02:24:25.866 --> 02:24:28.047]  We sound extreme saying martial law?
[02:24:28.047 --> 02:24:29.888]  They're the ones saying 25th Amendment.
[02:24:29.888 --> 02:24:31.329]  They're the ones saying remove.
[02:24:31.329 --> 02:24:36.131]  They're the ones saying kill his family, kill us, take our banking away, take us down.
[02:24:36.131 --> 02:24:42.475]  We're simply responding as the duly elected government to a rogue op with Chai Com and
[02:24:43.035 --> 02:24:44.696]  Junker EU tyranny!
[02:24:44.696 --> 02:24:45.977]  So what are we supposed to do?
[02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:51.361]  When they rise to this level, if we don't rise to meet it, we have become derelict in duty.
[02:24:51.361 --> 02:25:03.851]  And Alex, it's crucial to understand that the context of this potential martial law would be also in response to the mass chaos, uprising, and violence committed by the left.
[02:25:03.851 --> 02:25:06.173]  Which is in the Wikileaks, which is in the, exactly.
[02:25:06.673 --> 02:25:17.704]  Right, so, in fact, I've said to people in the last 12 hours who have questioned me on this, I said, there will come a time, probably, very soon in America when the left declares total war.
[02:25:17.704 --> 02:25:20.567]  Bloodshed on the streets is what they want.
[02:25:20.567 --> 02:25:22.449]  Hit lists, where they want to come out and kill people.
[02:25:22.449 --> 02:25:24.531]  Did you see the latest on VJ Media?
[02:25:24.531 --> 02:25:28.415]  Where they said, kill the ICE, kill the Congress, kill their dogs, print me that.
[02:25:28.655 --> 02:25:32.017]  And this is on major sites on Facebook and Twitter, not being taken down.
[02:25:32.017 --> 02:25:34.079]  They are girding for war!
[02:25:34.079 --> 02:25:34.879]  Yes, yes.
[02:25:34.879 --> 02:25:45.326]  And I believe there will come a time where the average American person will beg for a form of temporary martial law simply to restore some peace and stability in the cities.
[02:25:45.326 --> 02:25:50.349]  I have all the clips of CNN and MSNBC say, we want a civil emergency, they want race riots.
[02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:56.173]  So we're derelict in duty if we don't counter this unconstitutional, illegal, multinational corporate attack.
[02:25:56.633 --> 02:26:12.684]  Understand, this is right out of the rules for radicals is to cause massive chaos and they've got a hit list, Alex, and you're on the hit list and I'm on the hit list, but I believe that they have the home addresses and they want to go out and murder all prominent conservatives such as... Oh, notice what I got banned on Twitter for.
[02:26:12.684 --> 02:26:16.767]  It was when I said they've got your name and number if you're in Congress or you're a patriot.
[02:26:16.767 --> 02:26:17.087]  Exactly.
[02:26:17.087 --> 02:26:21.330]  Which I don't want to get into the details of this for obvious reasons, but we know.
[02:26:21.330 --> 02:26:21.951]  We know.
[02:26:21.951 --> 02:26:22.211]  We know.
[02:26:22.631 --> 02:26:24.633]  And what's interesting, this is from Independent Sources.
[02:26:24.633 --> 02:26:25.053]  Well, I got news.
[02:26:25.053 --> 02:26:27.335]  You notice Antifa hasn't been showing up in Austin anymore.
[02:26:27.335 --> 02:26:29.517]  I heard some bad things happen.
[02:26:29.517 --> 02:26:29.797]  Really?
[02:26:29.797 --> 02:26:31.878]  I heard people fell down.
[02:26:31.878 --> 02:26:32.759]  Oh.
[02:26:32.759 --> 02:26:34.480]  That can happen from time to time.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:36.002]  It wasn't me, but they pissed off SEAL Team 6.
[02:26:36.002 --> 02:26:42.307]  Well, I tell you what, what I find fascinating is I did this story with Independent Research.
[02:26:42.307 --> 02:26:48.892]  You know, you and I have independent, different sources, and yet when you combine our reporting and our investigations, they
[02:26:50.573 --> 02:26:53.156]  Support each other in the big picture of what's happening.
[02:26:53.156 --> 02:26:56.239]  This is why, Alex, this is why the Kavanaugh issue is so critical.
[02:26:56.239 --> 02:27:07.171]  If Kavanaugh does not get confirmed, then Trump doesn't have the backup support of this additional Supreme Court jurist to support his exerting... They've done the calculus that he is checkmate.
[02:27:07.631 --> 02:27:08.411]  That's right.
[02:27:08.411 --> 02:27:09.272]  That's right.
[02:27:09.272 --> 02:27:11.433]  And so, this is not about Roe vs. Wade.
[02:27:11.433 --> 02:27:17.315]  This resistance against Kavanaugh is about allowing the deep state to continue to overthrow America.
[02:27:17.315 --> 02:27:17.735]  And I agree.
[02:27:17.735 --> 02:27:19.856]  And I'm jumping in because you're so on target.
[02:27:19.856 --> 02:27:21.197]  This is just so epic what's happening.
[02:27:21.197 --> 02:27:21.777]  We're about to go to break.
[02:27:21.777 --> 02:27:23.377]  I'll give you the floor when we come back.
[02:27:23.377 --> 02:27:26.359]  We'll get to the executive orders, the proof of what the Stay Behind Network they set up.
[02:27:27.472 --> 02:27:31.393]  I think the Rosenstein thing is he said he was going to resign, that's confirmed.
[02:27:31.393 --> 02:27:35.675]  He tried to trick Trump into saying he was gone to say Trump made it up.
[02:27:35.675 --> 02:27:37.675]  Trump is really smart.
[02:27:37.675 --> 02:27:39.176]  They're playing high-level games right now.
[02:27:39.176 --> 02:27:56.761]  In fact, Rosenstein leaving the scene is really part of the unraveling of this threat of the deep state, combined with the declassification documents that, of course, the FBI and the DOJ are slow-walking with redactions, which defies the presidential order to release them in unredacted form.
[02:27:57.401 --> 02:28:03.968]  And by the way, when those documents come out, Alex, it is just, it's like dominoes falling at that point.
[02:28:03.968 --> 02:28:10.714]  Because I've talked to folks that have seen them, it is McCabe and all of them going, F him, he's a moron, ha ha ha.
[02:28:10.714 --> 02:28:13.197]  These arrogant SOBs, I mean, they are F'd.
[02:28:13.377 --> 02:28:14.278]  They are.
[02:28:14.278 --> 02:28:22.463]  I mean, history is now unfolding by the hour, and this will be the single greatest event that any of us have ever lived through in the history of this country.
[02:28:22.463 --> 02:28:24.865]  Mike, I can't get hype big enough for the show.
[02:28:24.865 --> 02:28:25.425]  I know.
[02:28:25.425 --> 02:28:29.708]  I get on here and I say, oh, earth-changing, incredible, incredible.
[02:28:29.708 --> 02:28:35.231]  If you knew what they were doing to me right now, imagine what they're doing to Kavanaugh, imagine what they're doing to Trump.
[02:28:35.231 --> 02:28:36.832]  Would you get people to say, oh my God, we better back off?
[02:28:36.832 --> 02:28:37.493]  No, I'm a man.
[02:28:38.173 --> 02:28:39.134]  Right, right, right.
[02:28:39.134 --> 02:28:40.374]  Let me guess, Mike, you're not afraid.
[02:28:40.374 --> 02:28:41.235]  You've never been more alive.
[02:28:41.235 --> 02:28:42.035]  Exactly.
[02:28:42.035 --> 02:28:42.475]  Exactly.
[02:28:42.475 --> 02:28:43.616]  Not afraid.
[02:28:43.616 --> 02:28:45.717]  I'm here for the Republic.
[02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:47.438]  I'm here to defend freedom.
[02:28:47.438 --> 02:28:49.739]  I'm here to expose these deep state traitors.
[02:28:49.739 --> 02:28:52.600]  Because America is a bigger idea than any of us individually.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:53.121]  That's right.
[02:28:53.121 --> 02:28:53.761]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.481 --> 02:29:00.924]  When you use public Wi-Fi, hackers and identity thieves can see anything you do online.

[02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:36.276]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[02:29:36.276 --> 02:29:38.237]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:33:35.538 --> 02:33:42.029]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:42.029 --> 02:33:44.313]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:47.774 --> 02:33:48.955]  All right, Mike Adams is here.
[02:33:48.955 --> 02:33:52.396]  He wrote the critical report up on Infowars.com and NaturalNews.com.
[02:33:52.396 --> 02:33:54.397]  He's got a new one I was going to get to as well.
[02:33:54.397 --> 02:33:55.258]  Emergency report.
[02:33:55.258 --> 02:33:58.460]  Trump planning mass arrest, military tribunals for deep state traders.
[02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:00.481]  Now, people go, oh my god, that's tyranny.
[02:34:00.481 --> 02:34:01.221]  No.
[02:34:01.221 --> 02:34:03.842]  Apple and Google worked with China rounding up political dissidents.
[02:34:03.842 --> 02:34:05.443]  They're now censoring us.
[02:34:05.443 --> 02:34:12.427]  The left is hitting people that go to conservative prayer events and they have bike locks and the local police are defending it in blue cities.
[02:34:13.826 --> 02:34:15.188]  Globalism's here.
[02:34:15.188 --> 02:34:17.191]  We have a rogue group trying to overthrow the president.
[02:34:17.191 --> 02:34:18.392]  That's the danger.
[02:34:18.392 --> 02:34:20.636]  George Washington would go after them instantly.
[02:34:20.636 --> 02:34:22.058]  So we're not calling for martial law.
[02:34:22.058 --> 02:34:25.242]  We're already under a civil emergency that Obama invoked.
[02:34:25.242 --> 02:34:27.625]  You've got the executive orders in your article.
[02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:28.567]  So let's explain this.
[02:34:28.567 --> 02:34:29.889]  We're not calling for martial law.
[02:34:29.889 --> 02:34:30.389]  We're saying...
[02:34:31.499 --> 02:34:36.181]  The Democrats have a dual government parallel operating.
[02:34:36.181 --> 02:34:37.962]  They now admit this.
[02:34:37.962 --> 02:34:40.643]  And think how far we've come, Mike, that now this is out in the open.
[02:34:40.643 --> 02:34:42.264]  But what do we do now?
[02:34:42.264 --> 02:34:43.384]  What does Trump do now?
[02:34:43.384 --> 02:34:48.427]  And 43 days out, with him going after Rosenstein and all the chicanery and all the games.
[02:34:50.008 --> 02:34:51.829]  There's epic stuff behind the scenes going on.
[02:34:51.829 --> 02:34:52.949]  What do we do?
[02:34:52.949 --> 02:34:54.090]  What should we be looking for?
[02:34:54.090 --> 02:35:00.294]  Well, it's clear that we are right now all suffering under really Obama's deep state martial law in many different forms.
[02:35:00.294 --> 02:35:04.677]  For example, you even described this a couple of weeks ago about digital martial law.
[02:35:04.677 --> 02:35:12.682]  The fact that virtually all Trump supporters are de-platformed, where we have this online book burning, these online restrictions by Google and Facebook and Apple.
[02:35:12.682 --> 02:35:14.063]  That's a form of digital martial law.
[02:35:14.423 --> 02:35:19.365]  There's an economic martial law in place where you've been deplatformed now by PayPal last week.
[02:35:19.365 --> 02:35:21.206]  Economic sabotage.
[02:35:21.206 --> 02:35:29.629]  These companies, by the way, I believe, I'm convinced, are taking orders from Obama's leftover CIA or Deep State people.
[02:35:29.629 --> 02:35:31.189]  They're answering to Obama.
[02:35:31.189 --> 02:35:32.290]  Obama's still running.
[02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:35.672]  The Obama regime, even though he's out of the White House.
[02:35:35.672 --> 02:35:42.157]  And so we are living under many, many different forms of martial law and speech police and thought police and so on.
[02:35:42.157 --> 02:35:44.159]  So the question is not, do you want martial law?
[02:35:44.159 --> 02:35:46.761]  And they believe that's the framework of why they've done it legally.
[02:35:46.761 --> 02:35:47.862]  They say it.
[02:35:47.862 --> 02:35:48.742]  We're the resistance.
[02:35:48.742 --> 02:35:49.943]  We Obama.
[02:35:49.943 --> 02:35:50.964]  Hillary's our president.
[02:35:50.964 --> 02:35:51.685]  We're fighting.
[02:35:52.506 --> 02:35:55.787]  Well, right, but they're actually fighting to destroy America.
[02:35:55.787 --> 02:35:57.607]  They're fighting to bring in... That's in the Veritas videos.
[02:35:57.607 --> 02:36:01.008]  They're like, we're going to sabotage fixing Veterans Affairs.
[02:36:01.008 --> 02:36:03.369]  We're going to sabotage the economy coming back.
[02:36:03.369 --> 02:36:09.991]  See, James O'Keefe and Project Veritas has just confirmed everything else that I researched and that you've been talking about.
[02:36:09.991 --> 02:36:13.832]  The deep state... Remember when we were teased about, oh, they said there's no deep state.
[02:36:14.552 --> 02:36:15.692]  Well, they give it different names.
[02:36:15.692 --> 02:36:19.493]  A steady state, the regular state, whatever.
[02:36:19.493 --> 02:36:21.174]  It's a deep state system.
[02:36:21.174 --> 02:36:24.834]  They are working to undermine and ultimately overthrow President Trump.
[02:36:24.834 --> 02:36:25.475]  Let's be clear.
[02:36:25.475 --> 02:36:27.675]  I get too close to the problem.
[02:36:27.675 --> 02:36:30.056]  You were telling me martial law, Trump needs a counter.
[02:36:30.056 --> 02:36:32.296]  I was like, well, that's true.
[02:36:32.296 --> 02:36:34.577]  They're the ones saying we're in a civil emergency.
[02:36:34.577 --> 02:36:35.957]  They're going to remove Trump from the 25th Amendment.
[02:36:36.437 --> 02:36:37.618]  They already did it.
[02:36:37.618 --> 02:36:40.159]  It's like, they already went to that level.
[02:36:40.159 --> 02:36:44.821]  The only way to counter it is that, and Trump has the authority as an elected president.
[02:36:44.821 --> 02:36:49.583]  And as I point out... You can't just sit there and let them pull off race riots and murder.
[02:36:49.583 --> 02:36:57.526]  Well, the thing is, Trump has already planned all of this, and this is what really shocked me about going through the Federal Register and looking at the executive orders.
[02:36:57.526 --> 02:36:59.227]  And there's one from December 26th of 2017.
[02:36:59.227 --> 02:37:01.848]  You know, I can tell you something really confirmed what you're saying.
[02:37:02.108 --> 02:37:02.769]  Really?
[02:37:02.769 --> 02:37:04.970]  Okay, yeah, bring it in, because I want to hear it.
[02:37:04.970 --> 02:37:07.432]  Executive Order 13818.
[02:37:07.432 --> 02:37:13.097]  Now, you know as well as I do, Alex, that the title of the executive order has no legal bearing, right?
[02:37:13.097 --> 02:37:15.099]  It's what's written in the executive order.
[02:37:15.099 --> 02:37:18.902]  Same way that a law passed in the Senate, the title could be made up fiction.
[02:37:19.562 --> 02:37:24.867]  It could be called the Saving Happy Children Act, but it's actually about abortions or something, right?
[02:37:24.867 --> 02:37:25.327]  Exactly.
[02:37:25.327 --> 02:37:26.788]  The title doesn't mean anything.
[02:37:26.788 --> 02:37:29.170]  The New Freedom Initiative, it's meant to put out the kids on drugs.
[02:37:29.170 --> 02:37:32.313]  Exactly, or the Patriot Act, to spy on all Americans, right?
[02:37:32.313 --> 02:37:47.006]  Well, the Blocking of Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption is the title of this executive order, and in it, it specifically outlines and describes what are the exact crimes of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[02:37:47.606 --> 02:38:05.572]  In corruption, where they have acted on behalf of a government official responsible for or complicit in corruption, including the misappropriation of state assets, this is Trump's language here, and corruption related to government contracts or the extraction of natural resources or bribery.
[02:38:05.572 --> 02:38:09.013]  Who extracted natural resources and engaged in bribery?
[02:38:09.013 --> 02:38:15.475]  Uranium One, Hillary Clinton, rubber stamp by Barack Obama, involving none other than James Comey and Robert Mueller.
[02:38:15.555 --> 02:38:18.237]  So you can see what Trump's executive orders are setting up.
[02:38:18.237 --> 02:38:32.988]  And then in that same order, actually earlier, Trump says, I therefore determine that these serious human rights abuses and corruption around the world constitute, quote, an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy and economy of the United States.
[02:38:32.988 --> 02:38:34.970]  And what he was doing was cutting off their foreign funding.
[02:38:35.728 --> 02:38:41.670]  Well, yeah, I mean, look, Obama committed massive international money laundering and fraud.
[02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:44.592]  With the Muslim Brotherhood, like $200 million at least.
[02:38:44.592 --> 02:38:57.857]  See, this, yeah, oh, it was tens of billions of dollars in cash and gold, remember, that he gave to the Iranian regime, flew in on the cargo planes with the pallets of cash, plus he, in order to do that- CNN, Bragdy was doing it!
[02:38:57.857 --> 02:39:03.079]  They funded bringing down our allies and blowing up churches and- These are massive international crimes- He's literally a jihadi.
[02:39:03.639 --> 02:39:06.261]  Obama is going to be named, I believe.
[02:39:06.261 --> 02:39:08.162]  I believe that Obama is going to be arrested.
[02:39:08.162 --> 02:39:11.464]  Did you notice how he was a shuddering mess in his latest speeches?
[02:39:11.464 --> 02:39:11.885]  No, I didn't.
[02:39:11.885 --> 02:39:12.705]  I didn't see his latest speeches.
[02:39:12.705 --> 02:39:14.286]  You could hardly even talk.
[02:39:14.286 --> 02:39:17.849]  Well, I don't doubt it, because he knows what's going down.
[02:39:17.849 --> 02:39:23.633]  Because he's like Rosenstein, another nobody who believed that his con game would go on forever.
[02:39:23.633 --> 02:39:24.693]  See, well, they got caught.
[02:39:24.693 --> 02:39:27.635]  They tried to carry out a coup, and they got caught.
[02:39:27.635 --> 02:39:30.557]  And it's due to the work of many, many people, including you, Alex.
[02:39:30.557 --> 02:39:31.238]  We should have started that.
[02:39:31.238 --> 02:39:33.319]  The point is, they've got martial law they believe in playing.
[02:39:33.319 --> 02:39:36.361]  They go full chaos after the documents come out and the arrests begin.
[02:39:36.361 --> 02:39:37.102]  The left will go full chaos.
[02:39:48.590 --> 02:40:01.256]  Now, until then, they're going to try to block Kavanaugh because they can't have a Supreme Court that sides with the executive emergency powers declarations that Trump will invoke once these declassified documents are fully released.
[02:40:01.256 --> 02:40:02.857]  And by the way, we know who their street army is.
[02:40:02.857 --> 02:40:04.238]  It's just like in these Veritas videos.
[02:40:04.238 --> 02:40:11.001]  It's these Democratic National Socialist people who were putting these on employees' doors last night about free housing.
[02:40:11.001 --> 02:40:13.823]  They have got an army of commies now coming out of the woodwork.
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:24.188]  And the thing is, these commies and these Antifa people, you and I know that they are tactically inept, that they are pathetic weaklings, but in their minds, they think they're superheroes.
[02:40:24.188 --> 02:40:25.749]  They think they're ninjas.
[02:40:25.749 --> 02:40:28.811]  And they think they can pull this off, so they will try it.
[02:40:28.811 --> 02:40:31.914]  And they will be defeated so rapidly.
[02:40:31.914 --> 02:40:32.995]  But it will shock them.
[02:40:32.995 --> 02:40:38.179]  I mean, don't they know that they've already all been basically lazed?
[02:40:39.195 --> 02:40:48.082]  Well, they're brainwashed by their people to thinking that Trump is an actual mafia.
[02:40:48.082 --> 02:40:49.103]  I don't think I'm invincible.
[02:40:49.103 --> 02:40:53.486]  I've already decided, like Patrick Henry, I don't want to die, but give me liberty, give me death, I'm ready to die.
[02:40:53.486 --> 02:40:54.787]  I don't want to.
[02:40:54.787 --> 02:40:58.430]  They think that, oh no, there's no threat, we're only going to win.
[02:40:58.430 --> 02:41:00.792]  They don't understand we're already committed all the way.
[02:41:00.792 --> 02:41:05.636]  All our energy, all our political stuff is only a shadow of what we would do once the physical war started.
[02:41:05.816 --> 02:41:17.663]  Well, and plus, on the side of Trump and on the side of America, you have law enforcement, you have oath keepers, you have veterans, active duty and retired veterans, and you've got citizens who are pro-Second Amendment and pro-Trump.
[02:41:17.663 --> 02:41:20.565]  But they think they're going to have the national media in command and control.
[02:41:21.385 --> 02:41:27.889]  It doesn't matter because Obama signed an executive order in 2012 that gives the president the ability to seize national media.
[02:41:27.889 --> 02:41:30.091]  If he knows he has that power.
[02:41:30.091 --> 02:41:31.131]  Clearly.
[02:41:31.131 --> 02:41:31.912]  He knows.
[02:41:31.912 --> 02:41:32.992]  He's got to know at this point.
[02:41:32.992 --> 02:41:40.837]  But look, Obama signed a series of executive orders planning on handing a dictatorship to Hillary Clinton.
[02:41:40.837 --> 02:41:46.481]  And so these extraordinary orders give power to the president, whoever that president may be.
[02:41:46.481 --> 02:41:47.101]  And that's the key.
[02:41:47.101 --> 02:41:48.062]  Explain that when we come back.
[02:41:48.931 --> 02:41:51.812]  Obama set up martial law provisions before he left.
[02:41:51.812 --> 02:41:52.852]  Yes.
[02:41:52.852 --> 02:41:55.353]  Because they knew Hillary was going to start a race war.
[02:41:55.353 --> 02:41:56.353]  Then Trump comes in.
[02:41:56.353 --> 02:41:58.274]  They just keep going with the plan.
[02:41:58.274 --> 02:41:59.114]  Well, right.
[02:41:59.114 --> 02:42:01.875]  I mean, Obama thinks that he's still president.
[02:42:01.875 --> 02:42:04.216]  And the deep state thinks that they still answer to Obama.
[02:42:06.593 --> 02:42:11.399]  But Trump has the ability to declassify and release all these documents, as he has ordered.
[02:42:11.399 --> 02:42:15.564]  And the defiance of that release is the last desperate ploy of this deep state.
[02:42:15.564 --> 02:42:17.826]  And let's be clear, we don't want martial law.
[02:42:17.826 --> 02:42:20.489]  The Democrats of deep state put us into it.
[02:42:20.489 --> 02:42:22.251]  But if somebody comes up with a club,
[02:42:23.032 --> 02:42:24.853]  In a fight, you get a club as well.
[02:42:24.853 --> 02:42:26.533]  We're not looking for this.
[02:42:26.533 --> 02:42:46.119]  We wanted to fix things, but... Yeah, we want liberty, we want the restoration of this constitutional republic, and I've even suggested that after Trump saves America and arrests these deep state traitors and cleans out the swamp, that he set a date for his own resignation to step aside and go down in history as the greatest hero to save America since George Washington himself.
[02:42:47.708 --> 02:42:49.471]  Because that'd be even better than serving two terms.
[02:42:49.471 --> 02:42:49.932]  Exactly.
[02:42:49.932 --> 02:42:50.433]  Exactly.
[02:42:50.433 --> 02:42:53.038]  Sit that down at the absolute prime.
[02:42:53.038 --> 02:42:54.079]  Oh my God, that's beautiful.
[02:42:55.191 --> 02:43:01.436]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying.
[02:43:01.436 --> 02:43:04.499]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[02:43:04.499 --> 02:43:06.520]  And so I've broken my contract.
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:10.604]  And right now, we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[02:43:10.604 --> 02:43:18.910]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses like I dream of Jeannie and there's this purple gas.
[02:43:18.910 --> 02:43:22.233]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:43:22.233 --> 02:43:24.395]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[02:43:25.235 --> 02:43:33.204]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract.
[02:43:33.204 --> 02:43:35.146]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:43:35.146 --> 02:43:37.489]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:43:37.489 --> 02:43:38.910]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:42.695]  We'll search Viable Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:43:42.695 --> 02:43:43.596]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[02:43:43.916 --> 02:43:47.399]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:44:00.296 --> 02:44:08.979]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:44:08.979 --> 02:44:10.960]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:14.421]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:44:14.421 --> 02:44:17.022]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:44:17.022 --> 02:44:19.323]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:44:19.323 --> 02:44:26.266]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[02:44:26.826 --> 02:44:36.612]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:44:36.612 --> 02:44:37.793]  We'll win.
[02:44:37.793 --> 02:44:40.115]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[02:44:40.115 --> 02:44:46.018]  And we're still able to operate the shopping carts and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[02:44:46.018 --> 02:44:47.860]  And you're right, to the market.
[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:51.542]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[02:44:51.542 --> 02:44:53.103]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[02:44:53.103 --> 02:44:53.783]  We need your support.

[02:44:59.841 --> 02:45:05.566]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:05.566 --> 02:45:13.452]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:13.452 --> 02:45:16.595]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:16.775 --> 02:45:22.058]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:45:22.058 --> 02:45:24.820]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.

[02:46:14.651 --> 02:46:17.714]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:46:17.714 --> 02:46:20.136]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[02:46:20.136 --> 02:46:23.699]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[02:46:23.699 --> 02:46:27.583]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[02:46:27.583 --> 02:46:36.231]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:46:36.591 --> 02:46:41.635]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.
[02:46:41.635 --> 02:46:47.579]  Not only does Vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but Vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[02:46:47.579 --> 02:46:49.721]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[02:46:49.721 --> 02:46:52.302]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:53.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.656 --> 02:47:17.621]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.621 --> 02:47:19.282]  Look, I know we got loaded phone lines.
[02:47:19.282 --> 02:47:21.564]  We're going to take phone calls 20-30 minutes to the next hour.
[02:47:21.564 --> 02:47:22.825]  Then Matt Bracken is joining us.
[02:47:22.825 --> 02:47:27.468]  Well, Mike Adams will be here and take your phone calls when we start the next hour.
[02:47:27.468 --> 02:47:33.954]  Most people being banned off PayPal and having all our sponsorship taken and they don't even let us sponsor on the web now.
[02:47:34.694 --> 02:47:38.038]  I mean, this is an example of big cartels coming together to shut us down.
[02:47:38.038 --> 02:47:39.540]  It's totally illegal.
[02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:41.182]  We'd just be plugging every segment.
[02:47:41.182 --> 02:47:42.504]  Like, go to infowarstore.com.
[02:47:42.504 --> 02:47:46.309]  We can still use PayPal and payment processing and get the products, get the t-shirts, get the books.
[02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:48.452]  Look, if you don't know by this point...
[02:47:49.667 --> 02:47:55.893]  That Infowars is real, and that Infowars cares about America and freedom, and we're just telling you like it is.
[02:47:55.893 --> 02:47:57.154]  I was never against the government.
[02:47:57.154 --> 02:47:58.756]  I didn't like globalist government.
[02:47:58.756 --> 02:47:59.837]  Now we got a beachhead.
[02:47:59.837 --> 02:48:03.601]  I'm all about the Constitution, and we have these provisions for a reason.
[02:48:03.601 --> 02:48:05.102]  Obama put martial law in.
[02:48:05.102 --> 02:48:05.863]  Trump came in.
[02:48:05.863 --> 02:48:06.904]  Nobody told him.
[02:48:06.904 --> 02:48:08.125]  Rosenstein didn't tell him.
[02:48:08.125 --> 02:48:09.547]  It's even in the news.
[02:48:09.547 --> 02:48:11.489]  They're trying to use a civil emergency to kick Trump out.
[02:48:11.809 --> 02:48:17.092]  I don't like to tell the enemy what's going on, but they lie so much, all I do is tell the truth.
[02:48:38.103 --> 02:48:40.384]  I mean, literally, I'm neurotic about it.
[02:48:40.384 --> 02:48:43.246]  And, you know, they're in the news.
[02:48:43.246 --> 02:48:45.347]  The New York Times is like, oh, Jones is being defeated.
[02:48:45.347 --> 02:48:47.368]  His audience is down 50%.
[02:48:47.368 --> 02:48:48.489]  Oh, his revenue is down.
[02:48:48.489 --> 02:48:50.130]  Well, that's not true.
[02:48:50.130 --> 02:48:51.571]  But then it's not the other thing.
[02:48:51.571 --> 02:48:54.532]  Alex Jones is winning the InfoWarm.
[02:48:54.532 --> 02:48:57.234]  They're crushing us, reaching new people.
[02:48:58.536 --> 02:49:04.137]  Our hardcore original audience has come back, and our hardcore audience is bigger than ever.
[02:49:04.137 --> 02:49:05.978]  And it's kind of like the Spartans, that's what really matters.
[02:49:05.978 --> 02:49:10.298]  So, you are the national asset, the national treasure, and I'm not just saying it.
[02:49:10.298 --> 02:49:13.739]  We're under attack first because, baby, you're it.
[02:49:13.739 --> 02:49:14.839]  They're scared of you.
[02:49:14.839 --> 02:49:18.160]  Whether you're a white woman or a black woman, Hispanic, I love you all.
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:21.921]  I went out to our rally, that's why they hate our rallies, it was like half the folks weren't white.
[02:49:21.921 --> 02:49:23.781]  I love it.
[02:49:23.781 --> 02:49:26.042]  Jesus, I just want humanity to survive.
[02:49:26.042 --> 02:49:27.262]  What I'm telling you right now is,
[02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:45.179]  The law firms don't want me to talk about it at this point, and we have cases that could be won, and I have the false suit this week, and it's going to cost a lot battling these people toe-to-toe, but believe me, by the end of the week, you'll see it in the news.
[02:49:45.179 --> 02:49:46.360]  So, it's an expression.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:48.341]  Do I sue them to stop this?
[02:49:48.341 --> 02:49:57.888]  I'm taking our payment processor, which is literally Mark of the Beast, global Chinese social score control, or do I just move forward?
[02:49:57.888 --> 02:49:59.709]  It's a catch, but at a certain point, I got to start suing.
[02:50:01.294 --> 02:50:02.816]  And again, that's not a panacea.
[02:50:02.816 --> 02:50:03.957]  It's just all I can do.
[02:50:03.957 --> 02:50:06.360]  But we need major funds to fight these people.
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:09.183]  Because just like they banned James Woods this weekend, they're banning everybody else.
[02:50:09.183 --> 02:50:10.705]  This is going to get more and more obvious.
[02:50:10.705 --> 02:50:12.487]  You're like, well then that'll destroy them.
[02:50:12.487 --> 02:50:14.470]  They think they're about to take over!
[02:50:14.470 --> 02:50:18.154]  They're doing like a bank robber gets caught robbing, he grabs a little kid and goes, I'll blow her head off!
[02:50:18.314 --> 02:50:19.235]  I'll blow her head off!
[02:50:19.235 --> 02:50:21.276]  I'll blow her head off!
[02:50:21.276 --> 02:50:22.797]  We'll kill Barron Trump!
[02:50:22.797 --> 02:50:23.938]  We'll kill the cops!
[02:50:23.938 --> 02:50:25.258]  Remember like Obama's last year?
[02:50:25.258 --> 02:50:27.200]  They were like shooting cops in the back of the head.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:28.480]  Cops aren't perfect.
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.182]  I don't like corrupt cops, but I don't hate cops.
[02:50:31.182 --> 02:50:32.243]  They were just shooting.
[02:50:32.243 --> 02:50:36.085]  CNN's like, well, five cops got shot in Dallas and four in Louisiana.
[02:50:36.085 --> 02:50:38.506]  Well, you know, they deserve it because cops are bad.
[02:50:38.506 --> 02:50:42.569]  They need to go under Loretta Lynch's Strong Cities Initiative and the UN.
[02:50:42.569 --> 02:50:43.850]  Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
[02:50:43.850 --> 02:50:45.611]  And I remember you used to hear old-timers even 20 years ago.
[02:50:45.831 --> 02:50:53.320]  The UN will take over the police under the memorandum 7277, which is a real memorandum, but I never thought they'd try it!
[02:50:56.365 --> 02:50:59.909]  We're in epic times, and X2 is a deep-earth, crystal-source of iodine.
[02:50:59.909 --> 02:51:01.171]  Nobody else has got it.
[02:51:01.171 --> 02:51:02.232]  They jacked up the prices.
[02:51:02.232 --> 02:51:03.153]  Problems with the old companies.
[02:51:03.153 --> 02:51:04.154]  It's the last run.
[02:51:04.154 --> 02:51:05.136]  Plus 25% off.
[02:51:05.136 --> 02:51:11.463]  RainForce, plus the great nootropic, our great secret 12 high-quality vitamin B12, 40% off.
[02:51:11.463 --> 02:51:13.606]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:51:13.606 --> 02:51:14.867]  Get a t-shirt, get a book.
[02:51:14.867 --> 02:51:15.728]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[02:51:16.769 --> 02:51:21.652]  We don't just have PayPal, but to watch the New York Times go, we took his only payment processor, he'll be bankrupt.
[02:51:21.652 --> 02:51:27.797]  I'm just like, my lawyers are like, I won't even say you have other processors, but it's just like playing this game.
[02:51:27.797 --> 02:51:29.117]  They're the censors!
[02:51:29.117 --> 02:51:30.358]  They're the monsters!
[02:51:30.358 --> 02:51:32.120]  They help China censor!
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:33.721]  They're pigs!
[02:51:33.721 --> 02:51:44.188]  And Soros bought a big piece of their operation just a month ago, and they're involved with China and this big merger with one of the main global processors.
[02:51:45.339 --> 02:51:47.379]  I'm not just saying this because they're going after me.
[02:51:47.379 --> 02:51:49.180]  I didn't look it up until the other day.
[02:51:49.180 --> 02:51:51.780]  Trump should block that as antitrust!
[02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:55.641]  These people are craven criminals, arrogant SOBs.
[02:51:55.641 --> 02:51:58.062]  I'll tell you a little secret.
[02:51:58.062 --> 02:52:01.922]  Two weeks ago, PayPal tried to get us to give us all their business.
[02:52:01.922 --> 02:52:06.063]  And I said, there's something, they said they want all of our processors and all of our internals.
[02:52:06.063 --> 02:52:07.944]  And I said, and Tim says, I feel weird.
[02:52:07.944 --> 02:52:09.284]  And I said, yeah, it's a setup, don't do it.
[02:52:09.284 --> 02:52:10.724]  And of course it was.
[02:52:10.724 --> 02:52:14.125]  They wanted it all to blast it and give that blueprint.
[02:52:15.228 --> 02:52:19.652]  So, again, people are like, oh my God, you may lose.
[02:52:19.652 --> 02:52:20.833]  We're all gonna lose.
[02:52:20.833 --> 02:52:22.214]  I'm not worried about me.
[02:52:22.214 --> 02:52:24.976]  Okay?
[02:52:24.976 --> 02:52:26.597]  I'm worried about all of us together.
[02:52:26.597 --> 02:52:29.079]  But, M4WarStore.com, M4WarsLife.com.
[02:52:30.185 --> 02:52:31.006]  Go there.
[02:52:31.006 --> 02:52:31.786]  Get a t-shirt.
[02:52:31.786 --> 02:52:32.627]  Get some coffee.
[02:52:32.627 --> 02:52:33.527]  Get some supplements.
[02:52:33.527 --> 02:52:34.668]  Do it today.
[02:52:34.668 --> 02:52:38.910]  Show that before they ban us on PayPal and all the rest of it, we've got money to operate more.
[02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:40.291]  We'll operate right through the election.
[02:52:40.291 --> 02:52:44.814]  But I tell you, if they took all our processing away, if they took all our sponsors, you know, we'll be shut down.
[02:52:44.814 --> 02:52:46.015]  But that's okay.
[02:52:46.015 --> 02:52:47.516]  People get killed in wars.
[02:52:47.516 --> 02:52:48.236]  Ships burn.
[02:52:48.236 --> 02:52:49.877]  You know, armies get defeated.
[02:52:49.877 --> 02:52:50.798]  But we keep fighting.
[02:52:53.371 --> 02:52:56.192]  It's not about me, ladies and gentlemen, it's about the war.
[02:52:56.192 --> 02:52:58.373]  But, I'll tell you this, we're like a ship.
[02:52:58.373 --> 02:53:01.935]  It's already devastated the enemy, but then there's a calm.
[02:53:01.935 --> 02:53:09.578]  And I'm out there alone, and all of a sudden, a whole armada comes around the island, and they're starting to fire at me, and their cannonballs are getting closer and closer.
[02:53:09.578 --> 02:53:12.700]  A few of them have hit the ship, and there's no wind.
[02:53:14.076 --> 02:53:16.177]  You're asking, how are they being propelled by the globalists?
[02:53:16.177 --> 02:53:17.498]  You are the wind.
[02:53:17.498 --> 02:53:24.463]  And if we see major financial support in your prayers and everything, that will get our sails going so that we'll live to fight another day.
[02:53:24.463 --> 02:53:27.044]  But I've already... The media's like, Jones wants to die.
[02:53:27.044 --> 02:53:27.685]  He's ready to die.
[02:53:27.685 --> 02:53:30.026]  No, I said I'm willing to die.
[02:53:30.026 --> 02:53:32.368]  Like, give me liberty or give me death or victory or death.
[02:53:32.368 --> 02:53:37.311]  As Colonel Travis said, it doesn't mean I want to, but if you're willing to go all the way, you have to be ready for that.
[02:53:37.311 --> 02:53:38.192]  It's not some power trip.
[02:53:38.192 --> 02:53:42.074]  It's actually, at this level, it's kind of like getting up in the morning or going to sleep at night.
[02:53:42.074 --> 02:53:43.035]  Like, I'm not scared.
[02:53:43.769 --> 02:53:48.131]  My God, you know, life has a lot more pain than that, seeing your children go through stuff or whatever.
[02:53:48.131 --> 02:53:49.071]  I don't fear death anymore.
[02:53:49.071 --> 02:53:50.632]  It's a real transition.
[02:53:50.632 --> 02:53:53.012]  But I do fear not living to my full potential.
[02:53:53.012 --> 02:53:59.215]  But I am totally, like plants rely on the sun or sails and ships rely on wind.
[02:53:59.215 --> 02:54:01.256]  You are InfoWars.
[02:54:01.256 --> 02:54:02.956]  So Mike, I'm ranting there.
[02:54:02.956 --> 02:54:07.338]  I just hope folks financially support us because we're in such a historic, critical time.
[02:54:08.507 --> 02:54:12.789]  That I just don't even know people realize how epic this is.
[02:54:12.789 --> 02:54:19.772]  It just reminds me of the Revolutionary War, when they're fighting the largest army and military might in the world.
[02:54:19.772 --> 02:54:20.452]  Never defeated.
[02:54:20.452 --> 02:54:26.235]  And just a rag-tag bunch of people who didn't have the funding of the British Empire, they didn't have all the technology.
[02:54:26.235 --> 02:54:27.135]  But they had the will.
[02:54:27.135 --> 02:54:27.956]  They had their spirit.
[02:54:29.777 --> 02:54:44.048]  Probably until the very end, it looked like they couldn't win, but they just kept at it, and they had that slogan that I've heard from my buddies in the Navy SEALs and others who just say, never, ever, ever surrender to any enemy.
[02:54:44.048 --> 02:54:47.251]  You keep fighting until the last breath, and guess what?
[02:54:47.251 --> 02:54:48.372]  You win, usually.
[02:54:48.372 --> 02:54:54.197]  When you have that attitude, and you keep fighting, and you're fighting for truth, and you're fighting for America, the real country.
[02:54:54.417 --> 02:55:00.581]  You gotta understand, these anti-American forces that are fighting to destroy America, they don't believe in anything.
[02:55:00.581 --> 02:55:01.582]  They don't believe in God.
[02:55:01.582 --> 02:55:06.625]  They don't believe in... Can you imagine how horrible it would be to not have a belief and not soul?
[02:55:06.625 --> 02:55:08.006]  I know.
[02:55:08.006 --> 02:55:14.531]  They are like little, just chaotic gremlin demons running around, destroy, kill, murder babies, everything.
[02:55:14.531 --> 02:55:15.271]  This is their slogan.
[02:55:15.271 --> 02:55:16.872]  Oh, power, power, power!
[02:55:16.872 --> 02:55:19.274]  Because nothing quenches them.
[02:55:19.274 --> 02:55:20.855]  Honor would fill them in one second.
[02:55:21.553 --> 02:55:23.214]  But they have no souls.
[02:55:23.214 --> 02:55:25.376]  I mean, they have no spirit.
[02:55:25.376 --> 02:55:27.857]  I mean, some of them may actually be soulless, for all we know.
[02:55:27.857 --> 02:55:29.298]  They certainly act that way.
[02:55:29.298 --> 02:55:51.413]  But, you see, because we are about transparency and truth, and we're about this country and the vision of what our forefathers fought for, and what the framers put in place, this brilliant system, in the history of the world, no country has ever been as astonishingly dedicated to liberty and freedom as America.
[02:55:51.773 --> 02:55:54.436]  And that's why all these forces want to control it.
[02:55:54.436 --> 02:55:54.957]  Yes.
[02:55:54.957 --> 02:55:58.541]  Because it's not too perfect, but there's a destiny.
[02:55:58.541 --> 02:56:01.785]  Obama worked eight years to destroy America from within.
[02:56:01.785 --> 02:56:01.985]  100%!
[02:56:01.985 --> 02:56:06.630]  And then Trump has only gotten 10% control and it's all turned around.
[02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:08.793]  That's why they're so panicked right now.
[02:56:08.953 --> 02:56:17.339]  And that's why they have to silence voices like yours or mine, because if people simply ponder simple truths, it's a revolution.
[02:56:17.339 --> 02:56:24.064]  The only way to keep the American people controlled and hating their own country is to keep them constantly brainwashed by CNN.
[02:56:24.064 --> 02:56:31.009]  Well, can you imagine the demoralization when he goes to Chile or Brazil or South Africa and says, you can't have a car or air conditioning?
[02:56:31.009 --> 02:56:31.490]  Right, right.
[02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:37.597]  He's literally flying around in jumbo jets, telling you demoralize... I'm trendy!
[02:56:37.597 --> 02:56:38.759]  I'm your God Obama!
[02:56:38.759 --> 02:56:39.820]  You can have nothing!
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:40.461]  Die!
[02:56:40.461 --> 02:56:41.562]  I'm liberal!
[02:56:41.562 --> 02:56:42.243]  Die!
[02:56:43.544 --> 02:56:53.647]  Well, the insanity is off the charts at this point, as we know, but getting back to practical matters here, number one, we need to support the confirmation of Kavanaugh for all the reasons we've been discussing here.
[02:56:53.647 --> 02:57:02.849]  And have you asked your viewers and listeners to call their senator and, you know, call Capital Switchboard number, it's a 202 number, call them.
[02:57:02.849 --> 02:57:03.369]  Let's pull it up.
[02:57:03.369 --> 02:57:05.110]  I mean, I've said people should take action.
[02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:06.090]  But we've got to.
[02:57:06.090 --> 02:57:06.690]  No, I agree.
[02:57:06.690 --> 02:57:08.371]  They're going to roll out even more women.
[02:57:08.991 --> 02:57:09.772]  Oh, of course they are!
[02:57:09.772 --> 02:57:10.672]  It's crazy!
[02:57:10.672 --> 02:57:13.595]  They say all these witnesses and they call the witnesses and they go, it's not true!
[02:57:13.595 --> 02:57:14.195]  Yeah, right.
[02:57:14.195 --> 02:57:15.096]  Exactly.
[02:57:15.096 --> 02:57:17.157]  No, this is complete fiction.
[02:57:17.157 --> 02:57:20.260]  All these accusations against Kavanaugh are totally political.
[02:57:20.260 --> 02:57:21.440]  Trump is right about that.
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:22.641]  They're complete fiction.
[02:57:22.641 --> 02:57:24.643]  And the Democrats think they still run the Senate!
[02:57:24.643 --> 02:57:24.943]  That's right.
[02:57:24.943 --> 02:57:26.164]  Let me get the number out since you mentioned it.
[02:57:26.164 --> 02:57:26.204]  202-224-3121.
[02:57:28.846 --> 02:57:29.767]  This is their waterloo.
[02:57:29.767 --> 02:57:31.910]  We get Kavanaugh in and win these midterms.
[02:57:31.910 --> 02:57:36.495]  Let's talk about what they do in the tech calls if we win this.
[02:57:36.495 --> 02:57:37.196]  202-224-3121.
[02:57:37.196 --> 02:57:38.437]  Call them right now, folks.
[02:57:38.437 --> 02:57:40.620]  This is epic time to be alive.
[02:57:40.620 --> 02:57:42.442]  Your calls loaded up straight ahead.

[02:59:59.426 --> 02:59:59.529]  Yeah.
[03:00:15.438 --> 03:00:26.562]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls with Mike Adams for a few segments, and then Owen Troyer is going to pop in about the InfoWars Army starting to really get some purchase, starting to really connect, starting to have some big effects, thanks to all of you out there.
[03:00:26.562 --> 03:00:28.063]  We've got some highlights of that.
[03:00:28.063 --> 03:00:31.865]  And then Matt Bracken coming up about the whole martial law situation.
[03:00:31.865 --> 03:00:34.105]  But folks have been holding really patiently.
[03:00:34.105 --> 03:00:40.048]  It is a problem, because we can get like 30, 40 calls at a time, but then even if I take a bunch, everybody has to hold, and then people always get hung up on.
[03:00:40.888 --> 03:00:44.411]  Illegal voting, midterms, Alex Jones battling censorship.
[03:00:44.411 --> 03:00:45.352]  That's a new caller.
[03:00:45.352 --> 03:00:49.775]  Mike, Trump's next move, 2020 election, media circus, Ellison.
[03:00:49.775 --> 03:00:53.618]  We've got Chris in Missouri, Russia, Kavanaugh, China, Iran, Matthew.
[03:00:53.618 --> 03:00:56.981]  Kavanaugh, Me Too movement, weaponized.
[03:00:56.981 --> 03:00:58.982]  Matthew's been holding a long time in Arizona.
[03:00:58.982 --> 03:01:00.364]  Matthew, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[03:01:00.364 --> 03:01:00.664]  Go ahead.
[03:01:01.991 --> 03:01:05.916]  This is the first time that I get to say thank you, Alex Jones.
[03:01:05.916 --> 03:01:09.081]  You are a part of history, no matter what's going at you, man.
[03:01:09.081 --> 03:01:10.322]  All you guys are, Mike Adams.
[03:01:10.322 --> 03:01:12.485]  But yeah, I mean, Alex, you are just like Trump.
[03:01:12.485 --> 03:01:13.747]  You're a part of history, man.
[03:01:13.747 --> 03:01:18.594]  Well, I want to be a part of history for the ride, but yeah, I mean, I'm not bowing down, so I appreciate your support, brother.
[03:01:19.361 --> 03:01:27.949]  Okay, so what I just want to say real quick, man, is we've been talking about how the Me Too movements and stuff can be weaponized in certain stuff.
[03:01:27.949 --> 03:01:39.581]  This is the perfect example of how weaponized they have used this with the Trump or Kavanaugh's nomination because now we have to be so delicate to handle this situation.
[03:01:39.581 --> 03:01:41.342]  Dude, I know for a fact
[03:01:42.103 --> 03:01:48.267]  Old girlfriends, once I got divorced, all got contacted, which means they've got FBI or NSA databases.
[03:01:48.267 --> 03:01:51.349]  Women I went out with, like, three times have been called.
[03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:53.670]  They have got my phone records.
[03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:55.131]  And they're like, yeah, he was a total gentleman.
[03:01:55.131 --> 03:01:56.632]  Boy, I wish he'd still go out with me.
[03:01:56.632 --> 03:01:58.713]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but I'm nice to women.
[03:01:58.713 --> 03:02:00.134]  And they've all gotten calls.
[03:02:01.374 --> 03:02:03.355]  Do you imagine what it's like for Kavanaugh?
[03:02:03.355 --> 03:02:12.322]  I mean, they target every woman that went to any university or any school or any town, and then of course it's a bunch of psychology professors, you know, that are leftists and hate men.
[03:02:13.439 --> 03:02:18.263]  Well, the problem with all this, Alex, is, of course, it's a complete abandonment of due process.
[03:02:18.263 --> 03:02:19.263]  Where's the evidence?
[03:02:19.263 --> 03:02:21.285]  Where are the collaborating witnesses?
[03:02:21.285 --> 03:02:25.829]  And where is the right to cross-examine this woman, Christine Blasey Ford?
[03:02:25.829 --> 03:02:27.970]  She needs to be cross-examined.
[03:02:27.970 --> 03:02:30.312]  There are so many holes in her story, it's absurd.
[03:02:30.312 --> 03:02:38.058]  But to convict Kavanaugh without any due process and any shred of evidence, it's so un-American, it's unacceptable.
[03:02:38.058 --> 03:02:39.659]  We should reject all of these claims.
[03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:42.040]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:43.181]  You're innocent until proven guilty.
[03:02:43.181 --> 03:02:47.682]  But I see Kavanaugh's lawyer and others like, we need to believe women, period, or you're against women.
[03:02:47.682 --> 03:02:48.023]  No!
[03:02:48.023 --> 03:02:49.703]  You're a person just like a man.
[03:02:49.703 --> 03:02:51.064]  Men lie, women lie.
[03:02:51.064 --> 03:02:52.184]  I'm not putting up with this crap.
[03:02:52.184 --> 03:02:54.305]  And plus, all their witnesses say it's not true.
[03:02:54.305 --> 03:02:55.005]  Anything else, Matthew?
[03:02:55.973 --> 03:03:03.739]  Yeah, I just was, uh, I've been putting hashtag not you too lately just to tell people, like, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[03:03:03.739 --> 03:03:08.223]  And it's just to show you how crazy it is in front of our eyes.
[03:03:08.223 --> 03:03:18.271]  Dude, I have seen stuff, I'm not going to say on air, when I was single for about a year, that was like the weirdest stuff at parties and stuff.
[03:03:18.271 --> 03:03:19.853]  And it's like a fetish or something.
[03:03:20.834 --> 03:03:26.537]  Where these liberal women come over, you'll be like at a party, sitting there drinking beer, and they go, I was raped a year ago.
[03:03:26.537 --> 03:03:27.838]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[03:03:27.838 --> 03:03:29.518]  Yes, I'm afraid you'll take me to the back room.
[03:03:29.518 --> 03:03:31.599]  And you're like, okay, I'll see you later.
[03:03:31.599 --> 03:03:33.480]  I mean, thank you for the call, Matthew.
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:34.021]  What's going on?
[03:03:34.912 --> 03:03:35.612]  Well, I don't know.
[03:03:35.612 --> 03:03:39.675]  I mean, it's gotta be part of this culture of self-victimization, which is what's taught to children.
[03:03:39.675 --> 03:03:40.756]  That's how you're somebody.
[03:03:40.756 --> 03:03:41.476]  Taught to college.
[03:03:41.476 --> 03:03:42.037]  Right, right.
[03:03:42.037 --> 03:03:47.220]  Like I said, at a Halloween party, I was wearing a captain's hat, and I had people come over and say, are you a Nazi?
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:47.600]  What?
[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:47.821]  What?
[03:03:47.821 --> 03:03:49.422]  And it was a captain hat with an anchor on it.
[03:03:49.422 --> 03:03:49.982]  Yeah.
[03:03:49.982 --> 03:03:53.825]  No, there's... I think Michael Savage has a new book about the mass hysteria.
[03:03:53.825 --> 03:03:55.085]  This is all mass hysteria.
[03:03:55.085 --> 03:03:58.648]  You notice that the things that liberals are afraid of are things that aren't real.
[03:03:58.648 --> 03:03:59.488]  Global warming.
[03:03:59.488 --> 03:04:02.010]  They think Nazis are running around America all day long.
[03:04:02.010 --> 03:04:04.592]  They think that... Yeah, America kicked Hitler's ash.
[03:04:05.593 --> 03:04:07.175]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:07.175 --> 03:04:14.823]  And we did that with a military and a conservative movement to protect America against foreign invaders.
[03:04:14.823 --> 03:04:20.690]  I say it's time to protect America again, and this whole culture of victimization needs to collapse and fail.
[03:04:22.151 --> 03:04:24.973]  Succeeding as an individual is a good thing.
[03:04:24.973 --> 03:04:28.196]  That's how America became a country, a strong country.
[03:04:28.196 --> 03:04:29.757]  NaturalNews.com, Mike, stay there.
[03:04:29.757 --> 03:04:31.818]  I want to come back and get more calls, but you're right.
[03:04:31.818 --> 03:04:39.044]  I mean, because again, your bold statement about Trump needs to declare martial law, the left has said we're in a civil emergency.
[03:04:39.044 --> 03:04:40.845]  They say martial law, remove him.
[03:04:40.845 --> 03:04:43.427]  How does he counter an illegal rogue group?
[03:04:43.427 --> 03:04:45.148]  You don't do that playing patty cake.
[03:04:45.148 --> 03:04:45.689]  No, and he's arrested.
[03:04:45.689 --> 03:04:50.572]  And so it takes courage to say what you said, because it's true.
[03:04:50.572 --> 03:04:51.033]  We'll be back.
[03:04:54.164 --> 03:05:01.629]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.

[03:05:48.318 --> 03:05:50.460]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:06:06.172 --> 03:06:10.596]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:10.596 --> 03:06:13.879]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:13.879 --> 03:06:18.062]  Alright, Mike Adams.
[03:06:18.062 --> 03:06:20.084]  Everybody knows InfoWars is not about hype.
[03:06:20.084 --> 03:06:24.447]  It's why we're demonized, it's why they want to shut us down, it's why they're trying to, you know, get rid of us.
[03:06:24.447 --> 03:06:30.452]  The Democrats admitted COG, 25th Amendment, removed the President, civil emergency, national emergency.
[03:06:30.452 --> 03:06:33.215]  We've got CNN, ABC News, all of it pushing it.
[03:06:33.835 --> 03:06:38.779]  So when you put out your article pointing out the executive orders that exist that Obama put in, we're under an emergency.
[03:06:38.779 --> 03:06:42.301]  Trump bare minimum, he should declare another emergency to get rid of that.
[03:06:42.301 --> 03:06:44.142]  That's how the law works.
[03:06:44.142 --> 03:06:49.927]  And just like, remember they called him, in fact guys type this into a search engine, Trump acting dictatorially pulling out of TPP.
[03:06:49.927 --> 03:06:50.947]  Remember that?
[03:06:50.947 --> 03:06:53.970]  In like the 23rd of January, you know, two days into office.
[03:06:55.049 --> 03:07:01.196]  Two and a half days in office, he pulls out of the Pacific Partnership that was totally authoritarian, written by the globalists.
[03:07:01.196 --> 03:07:02.297]  They said, oh, you're a dictator.
[03:07:02.297 --> 03:07:05.621]  Well, why'd you give the president the power to unilaterally do that?
[03:07:05.621 --> 03:07:12.088]  Because you thought you'd always have a Hillary or an Obama or somebody else, you know, a lapdog, sociopath, crazy person like him.
[03:07:12.088 --> 03:07:14.050]  So we're not saying we want martial law.
[03:07:14.050 --> 03:07:16.673]  We're saying they've already brought us to that level.
[03:07:17.173 --> 03:07:26.198]  Well, remember, every government official and member of the military and police and so on swears an oath to defend America against enemies both foreign and domestic.
[03:07:26.198 --> 03:07:29.999]  Well, these are the domestic enemies that you've been warned about.
[03:07:29.999 --> 03:07:32.921]  The deep state, under Obama, they're the domestic enemies.
[03:07:32.921 --> 03:07:41.265]  And it is not only a legitimate exercise of power, but I believe our duty, Alex, and Trump's duty to excise this cancer.
[03:07:41.265 --> 03:07:41.825]  But that's it.
[03:07:41.825 --> 03:07:44.967]  If you've got them saying, we're going to overthrow you, we don't care about elections,
[03:07:45.567 --> 03:07:47.408]  What do you do when you've got cancer?
[03:07:47.408 --> 03:07:50.229]  It's like, I don't want martial law, but they already say we're under it.
[03:07:50.229 --> 03:07:51.329]  Well, we're right.
[03:07:51.329 --> 03:07:55.851]  I mean, look, even Trump said this is a cancer on society, the deep state.
[03:07:55.851 --> 03:07:59.332]  The deep state must be destroyed if America is to be saved.
[03:07:59.332 --> 03:08:00.832]  And that's worth repeating.
[03:08:00.832 --> 03:08:04.113]  Look, America has no future if we don't defeat the deep state.
[03:08:04.113 --> 03:08:09.075]  It's a bunch of spoiled, crazy bureaucrats on the Chinese payroll who are brought up to hate America.
[03:08:09.395 --> 03:08:11.357]  And with a communist background, by the way.
[03:08:11.357 --> 03:08:14.020]  Look at John Brennan, even James Comey has a questionable background.
[03:08:14.020 --> 03:08:14.260]  All of them.
[03:08:14.260 --> 03:08:16.683]  By the way, people think, you go look it up, they brag they're communist.
[03:08:16.683 --> 03:08:17.223]  They do.
[03:08:17.223 --> 03:08:18.004]  They do.
[03:08:18.004 --> 03:08:24.451]  And so, even, you know, former Soviet Union spies, you know, bragged about how do you take over a country like America?
[03:08:24.451 --> 03:08:28.775]  You do it by infiltrating from the inside, and then you take over the culture.
[03:08:28.775 --> 03:08:31.899]  And then you point your finger at the patriots and say they're the commies.
[03:08:32.219 --> 03:08:39.468]  There was a guy, Besmianev, I believe, he came to the United States and gave all these lectures about how the Soviets would do it.
[03:08:39.468 --> 03:08:43.914]  That plan has practically been carried out, 90% accomplished, under Obama.
[03:08:43.914 --> 03:08:47.619]  If you look at the 50-something communist plans to bring down America, it's all been done.
[03:08:47.859 --> 03:08:48.820]  Yeah, Yuri is his name.
[03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:50.021]  Yuri Bezmenev.
[03:08:50.021 --> 03:08:51.542]  He's the guy who did these lectures.
[03:08:51.542 --> 03:08:55.045]  So, you know, most Americans don't know what's happening.
[03:08:55.045 --> 03:08:57.427]  And the media is mostly theater.
[03:08:57.427 --> 03:09:00.429]  They're telling you that this opposition to Kavanaugh is about Roe vs. Wade.
[03:09:00.429 --> 03:09:02.631]  It has nothing to do with Roe vs. Wade.
[03:09:02.631 --> 03:09:04.452]  That's just the story they tell the protesters.
[03:09:04.452 --> 03:09:07.174]  It has to do with Trump having control of the Supreme Court.
[03:09:07.174 --> 03:09:08.895]  That's what it's all about, Alex.
[03:09:08.895 --> 03:09:09.896]  And I want to be clear.
[03:09:09.896 --> 03:09:15.801]  Russia got colonized by the globalists, the bankers, and they use it as an exploitation army to take us over.
[03:09:15.801 --> 03:09:17.262]  They've already been under the leftist system.
[03:09:18.021 --> 03:09:20.323]  We are under siege.
[03:09:20.323 --> 03:09:21.865]  This is what you have to understand.
[03:09:21.865 --> 03:09:26.289]  I know I went out on a limb to say this, Alex, and I took some criticism.
[03:09:26.289 --> 03:09:27.109]  I don't care.
[03:09:27.109 --> 03:09:28.250]  We are under siege.
[03:09:28.250 --> 03:09:30.032]  This is not a time to be meek.
[03:09:30.032 --> 03:09:32.354]  I'm not going to be like those rhinos in Washington.
[03:09:32.354 --> 03:09:37.118]  We have foreign powers in control of Democrats trying to cause a civil war.
[03:09:37.118 --> 03:09:41.462]  And so if we don't say stop it, and if we're not tough, they're going to push.
[03:09:42.503 --> 03:09:44.944]  And this is why we have to lose our support.
[03:09:44.944 --> 03:09:47.146]  Notice there have been no hit pieces though.
[03:09:47.146 --> 03:09:49.547]  Guys, type in Alex Jones in that news.
[03:09:49.547 --> 03:09:51.248]  Not since this morning, maybe now.
[03:09:51.248 --> 03:09:54.049]  Because they don't want this getting traction.
[03:09:54.049 --> 03:09:54.750]  No, they don't.
[03:09:54.750 --> 03:09:59.593]  They tend to focus on your things from the past.
[03:09:59.593 --> 03:10:01.674]  They don't want to talk about things that are happening right now.
[03:10:01.674 --> 03:10:03.195]  Because Obama is in meetings with Hillary.
[03:10:03.195 --> 03:10:04.976]  Yeah, click news guys.
[03:10:06.050 --> 03:10:10.972]  Obama is in meetings with Hillary and they're telling everybody we're the legitimate government.
[03:10:10.972 --> 03:10:11.732]  Trump's illegitimate.
[03:10:11.732 --> 03:10:14.853]  They don't want us to point out that they're illegitimate.
[03:10:14.853 --> 03:10:16.154]  And that Trump has the power.
[03:10:16.154 --> 03:10:18.275]  The power is in the executive branch right now.
[03:10:18.275 --> 03:10:24.057]  Trump is not only the CEO of the entire executive branch of government, he is the commander-in-chief of the military.
[03:10:24.057 --> 03:10:25.918]  And again, everybody's scared of power.
[03:10:25.918 --> 03:10:26.318]  So am I.
[03:10:28.174 --> 03:10:34.436]  The rogue state already has it and says they're operating under a civil emergency in the executive orders of Obama.
[03:10:34.436 --> 03:10:35.356]  Do you understand?
[03:10:35.356 --> 03:10:37.417]  Obama is in the middle of his third term.
[03:10:37.417 --> 03:10:38.257]  Yes, yes.
[03:10:38.257 --> 03:10:44.099]  And it's about exercising power in the interest of giving the country back to the people is a good thing.
[03:10:44.099 --> 03:10:45.319]  Exercising power to strip...
[03:10:46.079 --> 03:10:49.341]  Liberties and rights away from the people is a bad thing.
[03:10:49.341 --> 03:10:53.403]  So it's not about is power good or bad, it's how power is used.
[03:10:53.403 --> 03:10:56.944]  Obama used power to take away our liberties and to destroy our country from within.
[03:10:56.944 --> 03:11:00.426]  Well sure, you can't censor big tech if they want to censor.
[03:11:00.426 --> 03:11:02.187]  The First Amendment says you can't do it.
[03:11:02.187 --> 03:11:04.588]  It's a law that points out the rights you have.
[03:11:04.588 --> 03:11:06.089]  It's not a law that's taking rights.
[03:11:06.289 --> 03:11:13.834]  And Big Tech and the fake news media, Washington Post and so on, they are not operating independently.
[03:11:13.834 --> 03:11:16.676]  They are colluding and they're being given orders of what to do.
[03:11:16.676 --> 03:11:18.517]  Which is a cartel.
[03:11:18.517 --> 03:11:20.018]  Look, it's a deep state.
[03:11:20.018 --> 03:11:26.423]  Do you think it's a coincidence that you were banned and deplatformed by 12 companies in the same 36-hour window?
[03:11:26.423 --> 03:11:27.003]  No.
[03:11:27.003 --> 03:11:28.164]  They all received orders.
[03:11:28.164 --> 03:11:28.764]  And now it's 90.
[03:11:28.764 --> 03:11:30.425]  Is it really?
[03:11:30.425 --> 03:11:30.885]  Yeah.
[03:11:30.885 --> 03:11:32.447]  Well, PayPal, all this.
[03:11:32.447 --> 03:11:33.407]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[03:11:33.407 --> 03:11:34.468]  You guys have really been trippers.
[03:11:34.468 --> 03:11:35.088]  I appreciate you.
[03:11:35.088 --> 03:11:36.029]  It's been all the longest here.
[03:11:36.850 --> 03:11:38.331]  Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[03:11:38.331 --> 03:11:40.633]  Miles in Michigan's been a long time.
[03:11:40.633 --> 03:11:42.755]  Duncan in Idaho.
[03:11:42.755 --> 03:11:44.276]  Mike in Minnesota.
[03:11:44.276 --> 03:11:45.537]  Let's go to Duncan in Idaho.
[03:11:45.537 --> 03:11:48.420]  Duncan, thanks for holding it on the air with Mike Adams.
[03:11:48.420 --> 03:11:50.401]  Hey, thanks Alex and Mike.
[03:11:50.401 --> 03:12:02.312]  In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson stated that he is combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution and unacknowledged by our laws.
[03:12:02.827 --> 03:12:03.207]  We're good.
[03:12:28.459 --> 03:12:31.723]  Absolutely.
[03:12:31.723 --> 03:12:33.625]  In fact, it becomes a dereliction of duty.
[03:12:33.625 --> 03:12:34.466]  Yes.
[03:12:34.466 --> 03:12:35.747]  Yeah, he has the power.
[03:12:35.747 --> 03:12:40.152]  The thing is, he is already working to assert that power, and yet he is being defied.
[03:12:40.152 --> 03:12:41.073]  Well, that's the problem.
[03:12:41.073 --> 03:12:45.958]  That's why he has to go to the military and the people, because they just ignore everything he says.
[03:12:45.958 --> 03:12:46.339]  That's right.
[03:12:46.559 --> 03:12:47.199]  Under law.
[03:12:47.199 --> 03:12:50.501]  If they will not follow the orders.
[03:12:50.501 --> 03:12:56.703]  It's like the judge walks in and the bailiff says F you and the court reporter says F you and everybody else does.
[03:12:56.703 --> 03:12:57.563]  What are you supposed to do?
[03:12:57.563 --> 03:13:01.145]  Well, if Obama had ordered declassified documents, they followed that.
[03:13:01.145 --> 03:13:01.545]  And they did.
[03:13:01.545 --> 03:13:03.226]  He did that many times, by the way.
[03:13:03.226 --> 03:13:05.486]  It's only when Trump orders things that they follow.
[03:13:05.486 --> 03:13:07.267]  So we're seeing open rebellion.
[03:13:07.267 --> 03:13:10.689]  That's exactly what it is and that's why... And we're not the ones calling for rebellion.
[03:13:10.689 --> 03:13:11.589]  We want our republic back.
[03:13:11.989 --> 03:13:15.730]  We want the restoration of the rule of law, the restoration of our republic.
[03:13:15.730 --> 03:13:16.390]  That's all we're asking.
[03:13:16.390 --> 03:13:18.551]  Because we don't fear declassification.
[03:13:18.551 --> 03:13:20.172]  Release my FBI file publicly.
[03:13:20.172 --> 03:13:24.793]  By the way, we don't have worship of Trump as an individual.
[03:13:24.793 --> 03:13:27.994]  We have loyalty to Trump as long as he's loyal to our Constitution.
[03:13:27.994 --> 03:13:28.775]  And I'm going to take that.
[03:13:28.775 --> 03:13:29.235]  Exactly.
[03:13:29.235 --> 03:13:30.435]  As long as he's loyal, we're loyal.
[03:13:30.435 --> 03:13:31.135]  That's right.
[03:13:31.135 --> 03:13:33.476]  If he turns against the Constitution, we turn against Trump.
[03:13:33.476 --> 03:13:35.477]  But he is so stubborn and everything.
[03:13:35.477 --> 03:13:36.117]  He can't do it.
[03:13:37.031 --> 03:13:38.572]  Can't do what?
[03:13:38.572 --> 03:13:39.572]  People that know Trump well.
[03:13:39.572 --> 03:13:41.173]  He's committed.
[03:13:41.173 --> 03:13:42.394]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:13:42.394 --> 03:13:44.835]  And that's why I have faith in Trump.
[03:13:44.835 --> 03:13:46.836]  That's why they hate him because he doesn't listen to them.
[03:13:47.461 --> 03:13:55.663]  Because he is dedicated to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and protecting America from these deep state traitors.
[03:13:55.663 --> 03:14:00.045]  And as long as Trump has that in his heart, then he has our loyalty and our support.
[03:14:00.045 --> 03:14:03.726]  And we can't be pig-like and expect he's going to do somersaults over all this.
[03:14:03.726 --> 03:14:04.826]  He's trying as hard as he can.
[03:14:04.826 --> 03:14:05.346]  Right, right.
[03:14:05.346 --> 03:14:08.807]  I mean, look at what is against him.
[03:14:08.807 --> 03:14:10.828]  Every institution in America is against Trump.
[03:14:12.048 --> 03:14:15.270]  The media, the universities, the financial institutions.
[03:14:15.270 --> 03:14:15.831]  It's incredible.
[03:14:15.831 --> 03:14:16.891]  Except the Pentagon.
[03:14:16.891 --> 03:14:18.632]  He's got the Pentagon on his side.
[03:14:18.632 --> 03:14:19.713]  Duncan, God bless you.
[03:14:19.713 --> 03:14:20.013]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14:20.013 --> 03:14:20.574]  Thank you, Duncan.
[03:14:20.574 --> 03:14:22.415]  Let's take another call.
[03:14:22.415 --> 03:14:23.315]  We've got a break.
[03:14:23.315 --> 03:14:26.317]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Minnesota.
[03:14:26.317 --> 03:14:26.978]  Thanks for holding, Mike.
[03:14:26.978 --> 03:14:29.639]  Go ahead.
[03:14:29.639 --> 03:14:32.221]  Hey, good afternoon, Mr. Jones and Mr. Adams.
[03:14:32.221 --> 03:14:33.722]  Welcome.
[03:14:33.722 --> 03:14:34.823]  Can you hear me okay?
[03:14:34.823 --> 03:14:35.003]  Yes.
[03:14:37.724 --> 03:14:55.634]  Before you guys went to your last break, really quick, and then you just went to your break, you mentioned about Trump, you know, step up, drain the swamp, clean out the deep state, and then give a date and resign and leave on a hero's note like Washington.
[03:14:55.634 --> 03:14:58.896]  While I think that's epic, you know,
[03:14:59.774 --> 03:15:01.015]  In what, less than two years?
[03:15:01.015 --> 03:15:06.240]  He's already managed to undo a pretty significant chunk of the damage done in the last 24.
[03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:16.870]  I think it would probably be best to, you know, stay in, do a second term, you know, that's allotted, and cement the foundation for the next president.
[03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:37.736]  Well, I hear you on this point, and my only point about announcing a resignation date is if he's forced into a situation where he has to declare martial law in order to keep civility in America, he needs to also assure the American people that that is a very temporary thing, and that he will not maintain that position on an ongoing basis.
[03:15:37.736 --> 03:15:38.897]  That was my whole point about that.
[03:15:40.100 --> 03:15:41.922]  There are so many factors here, who knows what's going to happen.
[03:15:41.922 --> 03:15:44.585]  Hold on, we're going to come back and we got Matt Bracken.
[03:15:44.585 --> 03:15:50.671]  We're going to do one more segment and then Matt Bracken's going to be here and I'm going to have Owen Troyer in here as well with some of the InfoWars Army stuff they're doing.
[03:15:50.671 --> 03:15:51.312]  InfoWars.com.
[03:15:51.312 --> 03:15:51.773]  Thanks for your call.
[03:15:54.815 --> 03:15:56.636]  I came back to my sunshine.
[03:15:56.636 --> 03:15:59.457]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.

[03:17:54.181 --> 03:17:58.079]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:17:59.423 --> 03:18:08.126]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:18:08.126 --> 03:18:10.087]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:18:10.087 --> 03:18:13.548]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:18:13.548 --> 03:18:16.169]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:18:16.169 --> 03:18:18.470]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:18:18.470 --> 03:18:25.413]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:18:25.953 --> 03:18:35.735]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:18:35.735 --> 03:18:36.935]  We'll win.
[03:18:36.935 --> 03:18:39.256]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:18:39.256 --> 03:18:46.977]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:18:46.977 --> 03:18:50.678]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globos may win.
[03:18:50.678 --> 03:18:52.238]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[03:18:52.238 --> 03:18:52.919]  We need your support.
[03:18:52.919 --> 03:18:53.579]  I'm Count Monk.
[03:18:55.439 --> 03:19:00.160]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying.
[03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:03.261]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[03:19:03.261 --> 03:19:05.281]  And so I've broken my contract.
[03:19:05.281 --> 03:19:09.963]  And right now, we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it.
[03:19:09.963 --> 03:19:15.484]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[03:19:15.484 --> 03:19:16.804]  Like I Dream of Jeannie in this.
[03:19:16.804 --> 03:19:17.685]  It's purple gas.
[03:19:17.685 --> 03:19:20.965]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[03:19:20.965 --> 03:19:23.126]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[03:19:23.986 --> 03:19:29.050]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[03:19:29.050 --> 03:19:30.752]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[03:19:30.752 --> 03:19:31.973]  I'm breaking the contract.
[03:19:31.973 --> 03:19:36.236]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[03:19:36.236 --> 03:19:38.018]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[03:19:38.018 --> 03:19:41.440]  I'm sure it's viable shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[03:19:41.440 --> 03:19:43.122]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[03:19:43.122 --> 03:19:46.044]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:46.044 --> 03:19:47.865]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[03:19:47.865 --> 03:19:49.287]  I suggest you stock up on it.
[03:19:49.287 --> 03:19:50.928]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[03:19:50.928 --> 03:19:51.989]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:51.989 --> 03:19:53.370]  It's 25% off right now.
[03:19:57.211 --> 03:19:59.827]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.419 --> 03:20:24.082]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:24.082 --> 03:20:26.442]  That's an old liner from like four years ago.
[03:20:26.442 --> 03:20:27.743]  We're getting America back.
[03:20:27.743 --> 03:20:30.564]  In fact, I can't wait to retire those liners.
[03:20:30.564 --> 03:20:31.844]  But right now the battle's going on.
[03:20:31.844 --> 03:20:34.105]  Matt Bracken's coming up next segment.
[03:20:34.105 --> 03:20:38.266]  Don't forget this next Wednesday, in two days, we're going to have a broadcast from 8 a.m.
[03:20:38.266 --> 03:20:40.807]  with David Knight, right through to midnight with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:41.667 --> 03:20:43.628]  And a bunch of other big in-studio guests.
[03:20:43.628 --> 03:20:45.290]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:46.951]  Stand with Trump.
[03:20:46.951 --> 03:20:49.312]  Stand with Infowars.
[03:20:49.312 --> 03:20:50.373]  Stand with free speech.
[03:20:50.373 --> 03:20:53.135]  Stand with America.
[03:20:53.135 --> 03:20:55.477]  Against the globalists.
[03:20:55.477 --> 03:20:57.018]  Now we've got some other pedophile news.
[03:20:57.018 --> 03:20:58.439]  Well, BuzzFeed's weighing in on it.
[03:20:58.439 --> 03:21:02.742]  The creator of one of YouTube's top tween channels was arrested for molesting a minor.
[03:21:02.742 --> 03:21:04.123]  YouTube is keeping the channel up.
[03:21:06.656 --> 03:21:08.397]  So, that's Charlie Wurzel.
[03:21:08.397 --> 03:21:09.878]  Is he trying to get his soul back or something?
[03:21:09.878 --> 03:21:12.779]  Is the guy lobbying ready to be taken down off of YouTube?
[03:21:12.779 --> 03:21:14.660]  So we're going to be... Oh my.
[03:21:14.660 --> 03:21:15.521]  It's never too late.
[03:21:15.521 --> 03:21:15.801]  Good.
[03:21:15.801 --> 03:21:17.362]  Charlie, get your soul back.
[03:21:17.362 --> 03:21:19.143]  Maybe you write an article about Salon promoting pedophilia.
[03:21:19.143 --> 03:21:22.124]  But Mike, people don't understand.
[03:21:22.124 --> 03:21:23.665]  We don't get up here and hype stuff.
[03:21:23.665 --> 03:21:25.006]  That's why they want to shut down.
[03:21:25.006 --> 03:21:27.607]  I'm going to ask Matt Bracken this question in just a moment.
[03:21:27.607 --> 03:21:31.289]  But why do you think they picked InfoWars first?
[03:21:31.289 --> 03:21:33.270]  And why are they so scared of it?
[03:21:33.270 --> 03:21:35.792]  Because in that is the answer to defeating them, I believe.
[03:21:36.892 --> 03:21:46.037]  Well, I think clearly they see your growth in reach, your growth in audience, and the sophistication of your broadcasting infrastructure has really freaked them out.
[03:21:46.037 --> 03:21:52.361]  Because if they hadn't censored you... It was when we got 400 TV stations this year.
[03:21:52.361 --> 03:21:53.321]  Yeah, see?
[03:21:53.321 --> 03:22:01.266]  And so, look, I've even, I've said this on camera before too, InfoWars has the infrastructure to be the replacement for the existing
[03:22:02.046 --> 03:22:03.688]  Anti-American media.
[03:22:03.688 --> 03:22:14.839]  So if this goes to civil war, if this goes to, you know, whatever scenarios happen, and the New York Times is shut down or completely discredited or something, you know what?
[03:22:14.839 --> 03:22:15.440]  Guess what?
[03:22:15.440 --> 03:22:17.021]  Infowars, the infrastructure you have,
[03:22:17.962 --> 03:22:25.227]  Well, we built it because we believe we're gonna try to do that.
[03:22:25.227 --> 03:22:27.789]  Plus, I'm not just gonna, like, make a bunch of money and have a jet airplane.
[03:22:27.789 --> 03:22:29.570]  I don't have a jet airplane like Glenn Beck.
[03:22:29.570 --> 03:22:31.351]  He has, like, a jumbo jet.
[03:22:31.351 --> 03:22:32.452]  Or at least he sold it.
[03:22:32.452 --> 03:22:33.873]  I'm trying to just fight the globalists.
[03:22:33.933 --> 03:22:36.994]  Yeah, what are you going to do with a jet airplane if you've lost your country?
[03:22:36.994 --> 03:22:37.375]  Right?
[03:22:37.375 --> 03:22:38.275]  It doesn't matter.
[03:22:38.275 --> 03:22:41.136]  You need... With the country back, then I'll take a jet airplane.
[03:22:41.136 --> 03:22:51.101]  Yeah, maybe, but, I mean, the thing is, there needs to be a new media, and you are the leader of the independent media, and that's irrefutable, and that's why you've been targeted.
[03:22:51.101 --> 03:22:53.122]  And, you know, look, it's going to continue.
[03:22:53.542 --> 03:22:57.664]  Until something big changes, but I think those changes are coming up very soon, Alex.
[03:22:57.664 --> 03:23:05.487]  I think because Google and Facebook have been spying and acting forever and getting away with it, they just have the chutzpah to go on forever, but it's not going on forever.
[03:23:05.487 --> 03:23:05.948]  No.
[03:23:05.948 --> 03:23:10.950]  No, I mean, the White House has been preparing, you know, executive orders to go after the tech giants.
[03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:13.831]  Their censorship is not going to be tolerated for much longer.
[03:23:13.831 --> 03:23:17.833]  And just like they got blindsided by Trump winning, they're about to really get blindsided.
[03:23:17.833 --> 03:23:18.113]  Yeah.
[03:23:18.413 --> 03:23:20.514]  Yeah, actually, history is on our side.
[03:23:20.514 --> 03:23:24.977]  And history is unfolding every day with the support of patriots.
[03:23:24.977 --> 03:23:30.861]  See, they never counted on you existing, and they never counted on people like me.
[03:23:30.861 --> 03:23:31.502]  Oh, the listeners.
[03:23:31.502 --> 03:23:34.844]  I mean, imagine who would actually... That's why they always think, like, oh, we must be government-run.
[03:23:34.844 --> 03:23:35.204]  No, we're not.
[03:23:35.204 --> 03:23:36.085]  We're just citizens.
[03:23:36.085 --> 03:23:38.226]  No, they think that most people can be intimidated.
[03:23:38.226 --> 03:23:42.309]  And how many attempts have been made to intimidate people like us and our viewers and our fans?
[03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:43.470]  That's their real blind spot.
[03:23:43.470 --> 03:23:44.390]  They think we're like them.
[03:23:44.390 --> 03:23:46.752]  The more they try to intimidate me, the madder I get.
[03:23:46.752 --> 03:23:48.113]  That's pretty much the way I work, too.
[03:23:48.654 --> 03:23:52.821]  Yeah, so their defeat is in the works.
[03:23:52.821 --> 03:23:53.582]  So there you go.
[03:23:53.582 --> 03:23:54.283]  That's my take on it.
[03:23:54.283 --> 03:23:56.808]  And thank God God gave us somebody like Trump at the right moment.
[03:23:56.808 --> 03:23:59.132]  I mean, we can't thank God for Trump enough.
[03:23:59.132 --> 03:23:59.733]  It's true.
[03:23:59.733 --> 03:24:00.174]  Just say it.
[03:24:00.174 --> 03:24:00.614]  He's amazing.
[03:24:01.184 --> 03:24:01.885]  Absolutely.
[03:24:01.885 --> 03:24:08.229]  I think he'll go down as the greatest president, aside from George Washington himself, if he does the right thing over the next few months.
[03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:11.751]  If he executes, he'll be bigger than George Washington.
[03:24:11.751 --> 03:24:13.212]  I'm telling you.
[03:24:13.212 --> 03:24:22.177]  Defeating the globalist deep state traitors and exposing the full truth of the media complicity with the FBI, I mean, it's the biggest story in the history of this country.
[03:24:22.177 --> 03:24:22.978]  It would make George Washington proud.
[03:24:23.058 --> 03:24:24.719]  Thank you so much, NaturalNews.com.
[03:24:24.719 --> 03:24:25.380]  Thank you.
[03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:26.620]  We're going to run this little promo.
[03:24:26.620 --> 03:24:27.841]  Matt Bracken's coming up.
[03:24:27.841 --> 03:24:31.064]  We've got the InfoWars Army with Owen Schroer with huge exploits coming up.
[03:24:31.064 --> 03:24:32.565]  Here is this little funny promo.
[03:24:32.565 --> 03:24:38.569]  We'll be right back.
[03:24:38.569 --> 03:24:44.052]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[03:24:44.052 --> 03:24:46.094]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[03:24:48.101 --> 03:24:57.450]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:57.450 --> 03:25:04.157]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[03:25:04.157 --> 03:25:09.422]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[03:25:09.422 --> 03:25:10.343]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:25:10.743 --> 03:25:13.185]  Not so fast, Edvard Woz.
[03:25:13.185 --> 03:25:14.827]  Apple banned your rap.
[03:25:14.827 --> 03:25:19.371]  I helped, too!
[03:25:19.371 --> 03:25:20.412]  Ah, Oliver.
[03:25:20.412 --> 03:25:24.215]  I hate free speech, too!
[03:25:24.215 --> 03:25:25.737]  We hate free speech!
[03:25:25.737 --> 03:25:28.979]  We hate free speech!
[03:25:28.979 --> 03:25:30.241]  We hate free speech!
[03:25:30.241 --> 03:25:32.162]  We hate free speech!
[03:25:34.645 --> 03:25:35.525]  Oh, and Troyer's here.
[03:25:35.525 --> 03:25:37.946]  Oh, and tell us about InfoWars Army and what you've been doing.
[03:25:37.946 --> 03:25:41.827]  Well, we're going to answer the lady's question about how you can connect with people in your local area.
[03:25:41.827 --> 03:25:43.808]  But basically, we're going out into the 3D world.
[03:25:43.808 --> 03:25:44.908]  They're banning Alex Jones.
[03:25:44.908 --> 03:25:46.449]  They're banning InfoWars on the Internet.
[03:25:46.449 --> 03:25:53.751]  So we decided to go out into the 3D world and invade ball games and just the streets and check out some of the stuff we've accomplished.
[03:25:53.751 --> 03:25:56.052]  And here's a promo of you at the Rangers game.
[03:25:56.052 --> 03:25:57.012]  And here it is.
[03:26:00.639 --> 03:26:03.821]  This is last night.
[03:26:03.821 --> 03:26:11.067]  If the radio listens, we'll break this down.
[03:26:11.067 --> 03:26:13.228]  And I know we play Milwaukee next year.
[03:26:13.228 --> 03:26:15.009]  Hope we get to see the Uke.
[03:26:15.009 --> 03:26:16.270]  Look at those M4 shirts.
[03:26:16.270 --> 03:26:19.473]  We probably won't see him in spring training, but... We used to.
[03:26:19.473 --> 03:26:20.053]  Yeah.
[03:26:20.053 --> 03:26:20.533]  That was fun.
[03:26:21.889 --> 03:26:23.570]  Look how dude's having to really sit up.
[03:26:23.570 --> 03:26:24.571]  He's a big guy.
[03:26:24.571 --> 03:26:25.772]  They made him sit down.
[03:26:25.772 --> 03:26:29.855]  I love how the moment you stand up with the Trump face on, he hits a home run.
[03:26:29.855 --> 03:26:30.415]  It's unbelievable.
[03:26:30.415 --> 03:26:33.198]  And we get a screen from our South Korean friends too.
[03:26:33.198 --> 03:26:37.981]  On the Usher.
[03:26:37.981 --> 03:26:40.163]  There's the CNN is fake news t-shirt we flashed.
[03:26:40.163 --> 03:26:42.204]  They got thousands of complaints from that.
[03:26:42.204 --> 03:26:45.827]  Which is the only thing that makes you want to do it more.
[03:26:45.827 --> 03:26:47.649]  How dare Americans express their feelings.
[03:26:47.649 --> 03:26:48.249]  This is not fair.
[03:26:48.249 --> 03:26:49.610]  Yeah, free speech at a ball game?
[03:26:49.610 --> 03:26:50.571]  Since when is that allowed?
[03:26:54.581 --> 03:27:03.523]  Here she is telling you to stop.
[03:27:03.523 --> 03:27:05.163]  Thousands of people calling in complaining.
[03:27:05.163 --> 03:27:08.464]  I like that pimp watch, dude.
[03:27:08.464 --> 03:27:10.964]  CNN's fake news.
[03:27:10.964 --> 03:27:18.865]  You're probably complaining to CNN, you can't tell what it says.
[03:27:18.865 --> 03:27:19.606]  There's the best part.
[03:27:23.533 --> 03:27:24.173]  There you go.
[03:27:24.173 --> 03:27:28.175]  You both pop up with Hillary and Trump mask and he hits a homerun when you do it.
[03:27:28.175 --> 03:27:29.715]  This is epic.
[03:27:29.715 --> 03:27:34.057]  The Trump effect.
[03:27:34.057 --> 03:27:35.478]  Oh man.
[03:27:35.478 --> 03:27:37.578]  He hits a homerun right when you do it.
[03:27:37.578 --> 03:27:38.699]  That was the one time you did it.
[03:27:38.699 --> 03:27:39.379]  The one time?
[03:27:39.379 --> 03:27:41.860]  And I figured I may only have one time.
[03:27:41.860 --> 03:27:42.860]  I may only have one shot.
[03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:44.461]  What does that articulately say?
[03:27:44.461 --> 03:27:46.682]  That the one time is the one homerun of the game?
[03:27:47.222 --> 03:27:52.505]  Alex, there were like 10, 20 different things that were providential that led to that one moment.
[03:27:52.505 --> 03:27:53.586]  I'm not even kidding you.
[03:27:53.586 --> 03:27:54.026]  It's unbelievable.
[03:27:54.026 --> 03:27:56.368]  I'm going to tell the full story on the war room here today.
[03:27:56.368 --> 03:28:05.053]  But for example, this video right here was shot by our South Korean friends behind us that traveled from South Korea to come see the Rangers series that weekend.
[03:28:05.053 --> 03:28:06.253]  And they were loving it!
[03:28:06.253 --> 03:28:09.535]  And they were taking pictures with us and recording and everything.
[03:28:09.535 --> 03:28:10.736]  There's so many different things.
[03:28:10.736 --> 03:28:12.357]  These compilations, we're putting them out.
[03:28:12.357 --> 03:28:13.698]  There's another example.
[03:28:13.698 --> 03:28:15.439]  The man got a free Alex Jones t-shirt.
[03:28:16.039 --> 03:28:24.914]  And there's another video we haven't gotten to yet that again, the great folks we have on the show are popping up at Trump events with the free Alex Jones sign.
[03:28:24.914 --> 03:28:27.398]  So that's how we take over this election, folks.
[03:28:29.477 --> 03:28:30.317]  It's unbelievable, Alex.
[03:28:30.317 --> 03:28:31.898]  I'm telling you, so many providential moments.
[03:28:31.898 --> 03:28:37.479]  I'm going to break it all down in the war room, including other people in InfoWarsArmy submitting videos, putting signs out on the highway.
[03:28:37.479 --> 03:28:42.240]  And when we come back, we're going to Matt Bracken, but what's that hashtag for folks that want to join the InfoWarsArmy?
[03:28:42.240 --> 03:28:43.320]  Hashtag InfoWarsArmy.
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:46.261]  I'm going to break this down to the other side and we're going to get Matt Bracken, but it's key.
[03:28:46.261 --> 03:28:50.542]  Use the hashtag InfoWarsArmy on Twitter to meet other people in your area.
[03:28:50.542 --> 03:28:51.842]  You just search the hashtag.
[03:28:53.160 --> 03:28:56.621]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.
[03:28:56.621 --> 03:28:59.442]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:28:59.442 --> 03:29:01.343]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:01.343 --> 03:29:06.405]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:29:06.405 --> 03:29:09.686]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:09.686 --> 03:29:15.968]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:29:15.968 --> 03:29:21.630]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work, and have a lifetime
[03:29:21.670 --> 03:29:23.872]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:29:23.872 --> 03:29:27.515]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[03:29:27.515 --> 03:29:29.436]  You can easily find Sunny Bay Heating Pads on Amazon.
[03:29:29.436 --> 03:29:31.538]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:54.042 --> 03:30:14.012]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:30:14.012 --> 03:30:16.133]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:30:16.133 --> 03:30:20.135]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[03:30:20.135 --> 03:30:21.156]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[03:30:21.576 --> 03:30:27.380]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:30:27.380 --> 03:30:29.762]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:30:29.762 --> 03:30:35.205]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:30:35.205 --> 03:30:37.687]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:30:37.687 --> 03:30:46.893]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:30:46.893 --> 03:30:51.336]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:30:53.934 --> 03:31:00.439]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[03:31:00.439 --> 03:31:07.265]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[03:31:07.265 --> 03:31:22.797]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:31:23.962 --> 03:31:27.805]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[03:31:54.443 --> 03:32:01.569]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[03:32:01.569 --> 03:32:13.941]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.

[03:32:33.098 --> 03:32:47.765]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[03:32:47.765 --> 03:32:50.366]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:32:50.366 --> 03:32:51.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:18.626 --> 03:33:22.348]  You see, we're not trying to conform with the system.
[03:33:22.348 --> 03:33:24.850]  We're trying to get back to the Americana and move forward.
[03:33:24.850 --> 03:33:26.911]  Matt Bracken, I appreciate you letting us commandeer two segments.
[03:33:26.911 --> 03:33:32.414]  You're going to be hosting with us on the big, what is it, 15, 16-hour broadcast coming up on Wednesday.
[03:33:32.414 --> 03:33:38.118]  The Stand with Trump, Stand with Infowars, Stand with Free Speech.
[03:33:38.118 --> 03:33:45.342]  The Democrats have been proven to have a deep stay, stay-behind networks that are engaged in an attempt at the 25th Amendment.
[03:33:45.342 --> 03:33:46.723]  They've been publicly pushing it.
[03:33:46.723 --> 03:33:48.304]  We first broke it 20 months ago.
[03:33:50.880 --> 03:33:52.241]  22 months ago.
[03:33:52.241 --> 03:33:57.465]  But as a former Navy SEAL and best-selling author and counterterrorism expert, I don't want to be too positive.
[03:33:57.465 --> 03:34:02.970]  He says he's going to declassify stuff, then the Inspector General says let's look at it, make sure none of it hurts anybody.
[03:34:02.970 --> 03:34:07.433]  Just those threats have Rosenstein saying he's going to resign, that he doesn't resign.
[03:34:07.433 --> 03:34:09.775]  I think trying to trick Trump into firing him, I'm not sure.
[03:34:09.775 --> 03:34:13.197]  But you're a smart cookie and you have a lot of sources.
[03:34:13.197 --> 03:34:14.859]  We know Rosenstein's a swamp creature.
[03:34:16.949 --> 03:34:24.096]  But clearly, Trump has to move against these guys because they've shown they're mentally ill and they have that criminal energy.
[03:34:24.096 --> 03:34:31.883]  Where do you think we are historically right now, Matt Bracken, of EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com?
[03:34:31.883 --> 03:34:33.985]  We're in the middle of a mutiny right now.
[03:34:33.985 --> 03:34:35.907]  That's what's going on in the military.
[03:34:35.907 --> 03:34:36.948]  This is called a mutiny.
[03:34:36.948 --> 03:34:42.533]  You know, the colonel ordered a platoon forward and the platoon said, no, we're going backwards.
[03:34:43.393 --> 03:34:49.157]  You know, the captain said, I need full speed, and the engine room said, no, we're going in reverse.
[03:34:49.157 --> 03:34:52.460]  He ordered those documents declassified.
[03:34:52.460 --> 03:34:57.284]  He didn't say, take your time and redact what you need to to save yourselves embarrassment.
[03:34:57.284 --> 03:35:03.989]  I mean, this is a slow motion coup, and we're only seeing, it's like a poker game where most of the cards are face down.
[03:35:04.679 --> 03:35:09.902]  We very rarely see a face card, you know, face up.
[03:35:09.902 --> 03:35:11.603]  We are in the middle of a real peace state.
[03:35:11.603 --> 03:35:12.983]  And I agree, this is beyond martial law.
[03:35:12.983 --> 03:35:16.025]  Martial law is an emergency where regular law is suspended.
[03:35:16.025 --> 03:35:17.205]  It could be good, it could be bad.
[03:35:17.205 --> 03:35:23.809]  When you have a mutiny of government agencies, it's rogue government, it is the worst type of martial law.
[03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:29.732]  It is a rogue, cancerous, lawless attempt at a coup.
[03:35:29.732 --> 03:35:34.374]  Yeah, I would actually suggest to Trump, if I had his ear, which I don't,
[03:35:34.972 --> 03:35:37.874]  That he call in the head of the U.S.
[03:35:37.874 --> 03:35:45.800]  Marshals and without anybody leaving the room and no phone calls, put together a squad of a dozen top U.S.
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:54.487]  Marshals and personally go to the Department of Justice, walk in there with the Marshals and say, hand me the documents, put them in my hand now and redacted.
[03:35:55.285 --> 03:36:00.750]  And anybody who refuses that direct order is going to be put in handcuffs and taken away and fired.
[03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:01.611]  No, I totally agree.
[03:36:01.611 --> 03:36:04.694]  We have to have the exercise of power because it's constitutional.
[03:36:05.615 --> 03:36:12.916]  Right, well, right now, in the middle of this coup, of this mutiny, there's push from both sides.
[03:36:12.916 --> 03:36:19.558]  Rosenstein going over to try to resign was just one of these, you know, the icebergs showing above the surface.
[03:36:19.558 --> 03:36:23.018]  But believe me, the sharks and alligators are in a full death battle below the surface.
[03:36:23.018 --> 03:36:23.398]  No, I agree.
[03:36:23.398 --> 03:36:24.399]  So you're a smart guy.
[03:36:24.399 --> 03:36:27.699]  What do you make of all the media saying he's resigned, and then he hasn't?
[03:36:27.699 --> 03:36:31.080]  I mean, this shows the civil war within the deep state is crazy.
[03:36:31.866 --> 03:36:37.989]  It's a period of flux, and it's leading up to Thursday, and I want to talk a moment about Thursday.
[03:36:37.989 --> 03:36:57.336]  Now there are two circles, two waves intersecting to make a supernode on Thursday, which is the Kavanaugh hearing, which promises to be like bigger than when Oliver North spoke, you know, electrifying the nation, and Rosenstein meeting Trump to either be fired... And why did Trump say Thursday?
[03:36:57.336 --> 03:37:00.718]  Because I think he's telling the deep state, stop bringing fake women forward.
[03:37:01.704 --> 03:37:07.306]  Well, not only that, but think about it from outside of the beltway.
[03:37:07.306 --> 03:37:12.168]  There's a Soros-Antifa army that's been mobilized.
[03:37:12.168 --> 03:37:15.429]  Jack Basovic has people inside of it.
[03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:18.430]  He's reporting doing infiltration.
[03:37:18.430 --> 03:37:21.772]  Presumably the FBI's supporting the Antifa.
[03:37:21.772 --> 03:37:26.573]  Like in Charlottesville, when they pushed the right-wingers into the Antifa.
[03:37:26.573 --> 03:37:30.655]  Instead of leading them away from the statue to avoid a confrontation,
[03:37:31.275 --> 03:37:34.860]  The feds created and sparked a confrontation.
[03:37:34.860 --> 03:37:44.873]  Something like that on Thursday could happen, where all it would take is one squeaky Fromm or one Arthur Bremer, because this is an outdoor event around the Supreme Court.
[03:37:44.873 --> 03:37:47.417]  There's going to be thousands of people screaming at each other.
[03:37:47.837 --> 03:37:58.285]  You know, pink hats on one side with abortion signs, NARAL, and on the other side are going to be, you know, conservatives, pro-lifers, and it's going to be a media frenzy.
[03:37:58.285 --> 03:38:00.567]  All it will take is a spark.
[03:38:00.567 --> 03:38:07.533]  I don't know what the spark will be, but it's like a grain elevator filled with, you know, with powdered flammables.
[03:38:07.913 --> 03:38:08.814]  We're good to go.
[03:38:19.406 --> 03:38:22.008]  The Supreme Court is their Politburo.
[03:38:22.008 --> 03:38:24.009]  It's their super legislature.
[03:38:24.009 --> 03:38:31.235]  They didn't mind getting one more conservative, but they cannot have Kavanaugh.
[03:38:31.235 --> 03:38:45.625]  Kavanaugh means they lose control of their Politburo, and that to them means they're going to move past politics and go straight to chaos, anarcho-tyranny, all bets are off, and another critical day
[03:38:46.431 --> 03:38:56.518]  Is November 6th, the midterms, and I just, out of curiosity, I was wondering how long is it from Thursday, critical day number one, to November 6th, critical day number two?
[03:38:56.518 --> 03:38:57.439]  It's 40 days.
[03:38:57.439 --> 03:38:57.779]  40 days.
[03:39:00.140 --> 03:39:02.442]  It's almost, you know, biblical.
[03:39:02.442 --> 03:39:10.508]  There's going to be a period of, I don't know, like Weimar Germany with communists and Nazis running at each other.
[03:39:10.508 --> 03:39:20.876]  This is a highly volatile atmosphere and anything can happen in the next, you know, between now, Thursday, and the midterms.
[03:39:20.876 --> 03:39:25.199]  But if the Republicans hold the midterms, the left goes absolutely ballistic.
[03:39:25.199 --> 03:39:26.700]  They quit on politics.
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:29.622]  They're going to go James Hodgkinson with the AFP.
[03:39:29.622 --> 03:39:31.043]  Well, that's been my big question.
[03:39:31.043 --> 03:39:33.365]  What do they do if Kavanaugh gets in?
[03:39:33.365 --> 03:39:34.146]  What's their trigger?
[03:39:34.146 --> 03:39:46.736]  Kavanaugh getting confirmed this week, or is it winning the midterms, Republican red wave, because the commie activity, they're just, they've now gotten off the streets, but they're creeping around.
[03:39:46.736 --> 03:39:47.937]  I know they're getting targets ready.
[03:39:49.519 --> 03:40:05.329]  If they lose both, if Kavanaugh is confirmed, and they lose the midterms, then the left will absolutely give up on working within the political process, and it'll be James Hodgkinson, Republican baseball practice time, all over the place.
[03:40:06.022 --> 03:40:14.588]  Um, if they, if Hodge, if Kavanaugh is, is, uh, thrown out and the Democrats win, then they kill the internet.
[03:40:14.588 --> 03:40:16.229]  You know, they go after us that way.
[03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:19.331]  Uh, it'll be hate crime laws like you can't believe.
[03:40:19.331 --> 03:40:20.392]  That's my next question.
[03:40:20.392 --> 03:40:22.573]  Why do you think they chose them for wars first?
[03:40:22.573 --> 03:40:25.295]  Now they're going after our credit card processing.
[03:40:25.295 --> 03:40:25.455]  Yeah.
[03:40:25.455 --> 03:40:27.596]  Well, there's, I have some, some news on that.
[03:40:27.596 --> 03:40:35.182]  There's I've, you know, because of my, of my, uh, profile is, you know, enemies, foreign and domestic, et cetera, over the last 15 years.
[03:40:36.721 --> 03:40:44.484]  People leak to me, and trust me, and, you know, there's going to be an announcement over the next few days.
[03:40:44.484 --> 03:41:01.870]  There's another platform coming from conservatives that's way better than BitChute, way better than Gab, but will integrate the functions of Facebook, YouTube, and Patreon all under one roof, in one house.
[03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:06.051]  The money, the videos, the podcasts, the social media,
[03:41:07.354 --> 03:41:08.775]  In one box.
[03:41:08.775 --> 03:41:09.875]  One transparent box.
[03:41:09.875 --> 03:41:13.896]  Sure, but it'll take time to grow that... It's already up.
[03:41:13.896 --> 03:41:15.897]  It's just going to be turned on.
[03:41:15.897 --> 03:41:17.517]  It's already fully functioning.
[03:41:17.517 --> 03:41:18.937]  I'm not talking about code writing.
[03:41:18.937 --> 03:41:19.618]  This is done.
[03:41:19.618 --> 03:41:22.919]  What do you make of Obama and Hillary and their stay-behind networks?
[03:41:22.919 --> 03:41:30.281]  Because they've got to be getting really scared right now that Trump finally showed... He showed will in the economy and other stuff, but will to go out to a deep state.
[03:41:30.281 --> 03:41:35.062]  This threat to declassify and them trying to play stalemate really has forced them out in the open.
[03:41:35.936 --> 03:41:41.260]  Well, with the McCabe memos, it's just a question of time until they come out.
[03:41:41.260 --> 03:41:54.649]  I think that part of the McCabe New York Times article was, even at the New York Times, they realize they're stuck on the wrong side of history, trying to cover this all up for the last year and a half, trying to run the deep state play.
[03:41:54.649 --> 03:42:00.113]  They have to start becoming more objective, otherwise they become a laughingstock for all history.
[03:42:00.113 --> 03:42:03.656]  So they're starting to launder the reality into their story,
[03:42:04.216 --> 03:42:07.697]  And so that's the McCabe memos.
[03:42:07.697 --> 03:42:12.298]  That's the infighting among the Deep State where they're going to take out Rosenstein.
[03:42:12.298 --> 03:42:19.440]  So this just to me indicates this, you know, sharks and alligators biting each other, feeding frenzy below the surface.
[03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:24.022]  And, you know, what's going to happen in the next couple of days is anybody's guess.
[03:42:24.022 --> 03:42:28.983]  But I think that really, seriously, we are in a sense of a mutiny.
[03:42:29.643 --> 03:42:30.224]  No, we are.
[03:42:30.224 --> 03:42:33.145]  That's what I've been calling it for 20 months, but I agree.
[03:42:33.145 --> 03:42:40.090]  It's the feeding frenzy and the rats turning on each other that is the real moment their front against us collapses.
[03:42:40.090 --> 03:42:43.532]  I don't want to be too positive, but I smell victory.
[03:42:43.532 --> 03:42:44.253]  We'll be back.
[03:42:44.253 --> 03:42:45.333]  Infowars.com.
[03:42:45.333 --> 03:42:46.554]  Newswars.com.
[03:42:46.554 --> 03:42:47.755]  Owen Suarez got some other comments.
[03:42:47.755 --> 03:42:53.198]  Matt Brackett straight ahead.
[03:42:53.198 --> 03:42:57.081]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:42:58.433 --> 03:43:06.498]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:43:06.498 --> 03:43:09.119]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:43:09.119 --> 03:43:12.561]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.561 --> 03:43:15.163]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:43:15.163 --> 03:43:16.744]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.444 --> 03:43:29.879]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[03:43:31.041 --> 03:43:34.762]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:43:34.762 --> 03:43:35.942]  We'll win.
[03:43:35.942 --> 03:43:38.263]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[03:43:38.263 --> 03:43:44.145]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[03:43:44.145 --> 03:43:45.985]  And you're right, to the market.
[03:43:45.985 --> 03:43:49.686]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[03:43:49.686 --> 03:43:50.906]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:43:50.906 --> 03:43:52.107]  We need your support.
[03:43:52.107 --> 03:43:52.647]  I'm counting on you.
[03:43:53.214 --> 03:43:58.058]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:58.058 --> 03:44:06.986]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[03:44:06.986 --> 03:44:12.330]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[03:44:12.330 --> 03:44:20.597]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[03:44:20.697 --> 03:44:21.017]  I think so.
[03:44:50.502 --> 03:44:56.766]  Info Wars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:44:56.766 --> 03:44:58.928]  We're really, really proud of it.

[03:45:49.072 --> 03:45:51.614]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[03:46:56.731 --> 03:46:59.348]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:20.859 --> 03:47:23.502]  Alright, Matt Bracken is hosting right now.
[03:47:23.502 --> 03:47:24.844]  We're riding shotgun with him.
[03:47:24.844 --> 03:47:30.171]  He'll be back with us this Wednesday when we do this big transmission, 8am to midnight.
[03:47:30.171 --> 03:47:34.336]  So you'll want to definitely tune into that big special transmission.
[03:47:34.336 --> 03:47:34.556]  You know...
[03:47:35.711 --> 03:47:39.215]  There's so much media people don't take from what we do here seriously.
[03:47:39.215 --> 03:47:40.836]  But we're really the ones being banned.
[03:47:40.836 --> 03:47:42.598]  We're really under attack.
[03:47:42.598 --> 03:47:44.040]  We're really the ones exposing all this.
[03:47:44.040 --> 03:47:51.748]  We're going to go back to Matt Bracken and let him take over here in the final equation with the points he's got that are always very salient from EnemiesForeignDomestic.com.
[03:47:51.748 --> 03:47:54.631]  But just finishing up with how people get involved in the InfoWars Army.
[03:47:55.202 --> 03:48:00.945]  Well, we had a caller earlier, Alex, that was wondering what she can do to connect with other people that are trying to take action.
[03:48:00.945 --> 03:48:13.552]  She was calling in from the San Francisco Bay Area, and she just wanted one other InfoWars Army member, one other InfoWarrior out there, one other Patriot out there, to go out there and pull a stunt that we're doing.
[03:48:13.552 --> 03:48:15.172]  Obviously, peaceful and lawful.
[03:48:15.172 --> 03:48:17.113]  Just red pills in the 3D world.
[03:48:17.113 --> 03:48:18.794]  Oh my God!
[03:48:18.794 --> 03:48:20.555]  One of your activists is a setup!
[03:48:20.555 --> 03:48:21.636]  We have a peaceful mission!
[03:48:22.196 --> 03:48:23.117]  That's their problem.
[03:48:23.117 --> 03:48:24.058]  We're not doing that.
[03:48:24.058 --> 03:48:33.666]  And we have a clear mission statement and people that send me any ideas or anything of violence or it's illegal, I will immediately either report them or terminate them from anything involving with us.
[03:48:33.666 --> 03:48:34.607]  But I haven't even had that.
[03:48:34.607 --> 03:48:36.089]  Everybody that's been sending us... It's all great.
[03:48:36.089 --> 03:48:39.852]  So get involved just like Hillary's a criminal, Bill Clinton's a rapist, same deal.
[03:48:39.852 --> 03:48:40.713]  Just here's what you do.
[03:48:40.713 --> 03:48:43.876]  You go on Twitter and you use the hashtag InfoWarsArmy.
[03:48:43.876 --> 03:48:44.977]  This is until they ban us.
[03:48:44.977 --> 03:48:46.298]  We'll re-merge and regroup then.
[03:48:46.678 --> 03:48:48.719]  Hashtag InfoWarsArmy.
[03:48:48.719 --> 03:48:54.182]  You put in the city that you're in, zip code, whatever, and you use the hashtag InfoWarsArmy.
[03:48:54.182 --> 03:48:59.244]  Then other people can do the same thing, and then you search the hashtag InfoWarsArmy, and you go down the list.
[03:48:59.244 --> 03:49:04.607]  You see, okay, Santa Monica, San Francisco, L.A., you know, Washington, D.C., you know, Tampa, Florida.
[03:49:04.607 --> 03:49:08.609]  But you jog down the list, and you say, oh, there's my, Billings, Montana, boom.
[03:49:08.609 --> 03:49:10.190]  So that's how you connect with these people.
[03:49:10.190 --> 03:49:11.011]  So that's what we're doing.
[03:49:11.011 --> 03:49:11.691]  The caller asked,
[03:49:12.071 --> 03:49:13.251]  How can I find people?
[03:49:13.251 --> 03:49:14.532]  People are already figuring out.
[03:49:14.532 --> 03:49:20.473]  You use hashtag InfoWarsArmy, put in your area, and then you search it and you find other like-minded patriots.
[03:49:20.473 --> 03:49:23.193]  Then you can group and you can take action in the streets.
[03:49:23.193 --> 03:49:26.314]  Peaceful, lawful, citizen activism, activism, free press.
[03:49:26.314 --> 03:49:28.374]  And you're going to be on at 10 minutes with the War Room.
[03:49:28.374 --> 03:49:29.975]  Hopefully Matt gets back on there with you.
[03:49:29.975 --> 03:49:31.595]  InfoWars.com, voice, live show.
[03:49:31.595 --> 03:49:32.315]  Great job.
[03:49:32.315 --> 03:49:33.315]  Okay, Matt, take over.
[03:49:33.315 --> 03:49:34.535]  Sorry to hijack the hour today.
[03:49:34.535 --> 03:49:36.156]  Really appreciate you being here with us.
[03:49:36.156 --> 03:49:36.816]  Go ahead and take over.
[03:49:37.901 --> 03:49:38.782]  Yeah, thanks.
[03:49:38.782 --> 03:49:45.345]  Yeah, I'd like to talk about Thursday a little bit because Thursday really is going to be a day for the history books.
[03:49:45.345 --> 03:49:45.806]  I agree.
[03:49:45.806 --> 03:49:48.427]  Why do you think Trump picked that date to make the Kavanaugh decision?
[03:49:52.193 --> 03:49:53.294]  I think it's a deliberate.
[03:49:53.294 --> 03:49:59.157]  You know, remember, he's the master showman, and I think he's been considering the whole declassification process for months.
[03:49:59.157 --> 03:50:07.581]  Also, in the reality television sense of the optics and the timing, you know, they say in comedy and timing is everything.
[03:50:07.581 --> 03:50:14.304]  And I think he as a businessman and a showman, he understands that many, maybe better than any president before.
[03:50:14.304 --> 03:50:17.066]  But on Thursday, consider the optics.
[03:50:17.066 --> 03:50:21.808]  You're going to have on the one side, Christine, Christine Ford.
[03:50:22.907 --> 03:50:36.992]  Now, some people have said the reason, and I agree, the reason that they stalled for a week was not only to demonstrate the impotence of the Republicans, but also it's sort of like a preparation, even a drying out period for her.
[03:50:36.992 --> 03:50:49.256]  If you've seen the movie Flight with Denzel Washington, he gets drunk the night before he has to go talk to the FAA, testify to the FAA, and John Goodman has to come in and literally
[03:50:52.788 --> 03:51:09.818]  And I think that both Christine Ford and the Ramirez woman are very likely to be such low credibility screwballs that they're going to actually destroy their case if and when they testify.
[03:51:09.818 --> 03:51:16.081]  Put against them, Brett Kavanaugh, he's a professional wordsmith.
[03:51:16.081 --> 03:51:19.663]  He convinces people, he thinks and he writes
[03:51:20.436 --> 03:51:23.158]  And he convinces people for a living.
[03:51:23.158 --> 03:51:24.659]  That's what he does.
[03:51:24.659 --> 03:51:29.661]  He turns words into ideas and arguments to convince people.
[03:51:29.661 --> 03:51:33.644]  It's going to be like Babe Ruth going up against, you know... No, I agree.
[03:51:33.644 --> 03:51:37.106]  So they did this to stall to have more women make more false allegations.
[03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:52.806]  But now it's gone to the farce period with creepy porn lawyer Avenetti saying that Judge and Kavanaugh were leading drug rape orgies.
[03:51:52.806 --> 03:51:57.288]  So it's gone to the farce level and it loses all credibility.
[03:51:58.428 --> 03:52:05.070]  The intermediaries, the intermediaries between the deep state, remember that Bob Kramer guy?
[03:52:05.070 --> 03:52:14.253]  He was in the White House hundreds of times under Obama and he was the one responsible for triggering lunatics to go, you know, cause fights at Trump rallies.
[03:52:14.253 --> 03:52:23.896]  So those intermediaries that have an arm in the anti-fump wing and an arm in the Hillary Clinton Obama deep state,
[03:52:24.580 --> 03:52:31.775]  They're probably panicking at the thought that on Thursday, their witnesses are going to look like crazy screwballs.
[03:52:32.521 --> 03:52:36.602]  And Kavanaugh is going to make a better impression, say, than Oliver North.
[03:52:36.602 --> 03:52:40.423]  For folks that go back to the Iran-Contra era, remember that.
[03:52:40.423 --> 03:52:49.585]  He was expected to be a damaging item to Reagan, but he turned out to be like a super patriot, super credible.
[03:52:49.585 --> 03:52:51.485]  And it turned the whole thing.
[03:52:51.485 --> 03:52:58.207]  So, if Kavanaugh looks highly credible and his arguments are super persuasive, remember, that's what he does for a living.
[03:52:59.404 --> 03:53:11.153]  This is probably a very frightening prospect to these Bob Kramer type intermediaries that work between the Antifa street rebels and the Hillary Clinton Obama team.
[03:53:11.153 --> 03:53:12.654]  No, I agree.
[03:53:12.654 --> 03:53:15.376]  They can't help but start the fight, but now they're in it.
[03:53:15.376 --> 03:53:18.238]  Kavanaugh has said, I will not be intimidated into a drawing.
[03:53:18.238 --> 03:53:19.919]  That's his latest statement.
[03:53:19.919 --> 03:53:26.364]  But if, before he testifies, if something goes boom outside of the Supreme Court,
[03:53:27.384 --> 03:53:44.496]  If they have calculated, the strategic intermediaries, if they calculate that this is going to be a disaster and lead to Kavanaugh's confirmation by vote in the Senate, then they might try to say, blow it up.
[03:53:45.074 --> 03:53:51.076]  And they'll send in a squeaky from that they've probably got on ice somewhere, you know, teaching her how to shoot a revolver.
[03:53:51.076 --> 03:53:58.920]  Or they're going to send in an Arthur Bremmer, one of these, you know, Doctor or Professor Raoul X type characters.
[03:53:58.920 --> 03:54:01.961]  They've got wound up mental patients ready right now for terror attacks.
[03:54:02.782 --> 03:54:06.044]  And that's to just kick over the whole poker table.
[03:54:06.044 --> 03:54:10.446]  If they think they're about to lose on Thursday, kick over the whole poker table.
[03:54:10.446 --> 03:54:25.373]  And at the same time, Thursday could be the day that Trump does go into the Department of Justice with the marshals and say, and the cameras and say, put the documents in my hand or you're under arrest as a mutant, as for defying a direct legal order.
[03:54:25.373 --> 03:54:27.334]  I mean, this is really a historical week.
[03:54:28.530 --> 03:54:32.892]  No, I mean, I agree, you cannot hype how crazy things are.
[03:54:32.892 --> 03:54:37.114]  And I agree, the globals to the left are losing, not just here, but all over the world.
[03:54:37.114 --> 03:54:43.437]  And even Soros tells the New York Times we're losing, and the Financial Times says they're losing, but they don't know how to quit, Matt.
[03:54:44.107 --> 03:54:44.487]  No.
[03:54:44.487 --> 03:54:45.468]  The left can't quit.
[03:54:45.468 --> 03:54:48.790]  The left does not know how to back down.
[03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:55.294]  Individuals in the left can get red-pilled and fade away, but that leaves the core even crazier.
[03:54:55.294 --> 03:54:59.457]  And like a black hole, it starts spinning faster and faster until an implosion.
[03:54:59.457 --> 03:55:01.358]  It always goes to... That's right.
[03:55:01.358 --> 03:55:05.201]  Only the most insane stick with it, but then that makes it actually stronger.
[03:55:06.311 --> 03:55:22.143]  Yes, but if on Thursday Kavanaugh comes across believable and the women are crazy and at the same time Rosenstein resigns and Trump says, you know, you have an hour to turn over these documents that I asked for for two weeks or we're going to start arresting people.
[03:55:22.762 --> 03:55:25.185]  You know, that's the kind of day it could be on Thursday.
[03:55:25.185 --> 03:55:29.609]  Now, on my Twitter feed, I wrote a poem, but I'm not a musician.
[03:55:29.609 --> 03:55:34.915]  I wrote a long poem, not a long poem, but it's to the Ballad of the Green Beret, same tune.
[03:55:34.915 --> 03:55:40.321]  It's called the Ballad of the Social Justice Warrior, because I think the whole thing's a setup from day one.
[03:55:40.321 --> 03:55:43.844]  Is that the way if I die, pin these wings on my chest?
[03:55:44.545 --> 03:55:47.266]  Yeah, this is a pink pussy hat on my head.
[03:55:47.266 --> 03:55:54.069]  But anyway, if there's any musicians out there, go to my Twitter feed, bang it out on the guitar, and put it up on YouTube.
[03:55:54.069 --> 03:55:56.730]  We still have time to make a viral video.
[03:55:56.730 --> 03:55:57.930]  I just am not a musician.
[03:55:57.930 --> 03:55:58.651]  No, I agree.
[03:55:58.651 --> 03:56:00.191]  Everyone shouldn't take this as a joke.
[03:56:00.191 --> 03:56:01.832]  We need maximum effort.
[03:56:01.832 --> 03:56:06.514]  Notice that Biden and Obama yell at people at rallies, they go, get serious, it's war!
[03:56:06.514 --> 03:56:13.277]  Everybody has, call C-SPAN, call local talk radio, go speak in front of your local legislature, your city council.
[03:56:13.277 --> 03:56:13.877]  Maximum
[03:56:15.767 --> 03:56:17.208]  Engagement now.
[03:56:17.208 --> 03:56:19.950]  We are at the crossroads, Matt Braggin.
[03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:20.991]  We are at a crossroads.
[03:56:20.991 --> 03:56:23.112]  This is the critical week.
[03:56:23.112 --> 03:56:28.116]  This is the week when things can go right off the rails or the ship can be put right.
[03:56:28.116 --> 03:56:30.397]  But we need to support the president.
[03:56:30.397 --> 03:56:33.239]  He's trying to put down a mutiny.
[03:56:33.239 --> 03:56:39.623]  At the same time, he's trying to not do anything which can be portrayed in the traitor press as, you know, Trump is crazy.
[03:56:39.623 --> 03:56:40.704]  Which is his only mistake.
[03:56:40.704 --> 03:56:41.805]  He's got to start ignoring them.
[03:56:42.205 --> 03:56:43.405]  We were all going straight to heaven.
[03:56:43.405 --> 03:56:44.586]  We were all going straight to hell.
[03:56:44.586 --> 03:56:45.706]  A tale of two cities.
