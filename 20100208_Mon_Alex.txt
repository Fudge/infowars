[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  You want answers?
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.560]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.560 --> 00:38.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.560 --> 00:45.800]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome, and again, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:45.800 --> 00:54.800]  Very important broadcast lined up for you on this 8th day of February, 2010.
[00:54.800 --> 01:02.880]  We have confirmed that all over the world, major Internet service providers are blocking
[01:02.880 --> 01:12.640]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and WikiLeaks and hundreds of other alternative news or
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.200]  research sites.
[01:17.200 --> 01:24.840]  That does not mean that if you're in New Zealand or Australia or China or Italy that you still
[01:24.840 --> 01:31.800]  can't get the sites on some Internet service providers, but the major hubs, the major backbones
[01:31.800 --> 01:40.720]  are blocking us, and we've even gotten customer service tickets from New Zealand, where some
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.120]  of the big companies are apologizing and restoring it, saying they don't know why it was blocked.
[01:46.120 --> 02:01.560]  So yes, it's going on, and we have this information with the background knowledge that the
[02:01.560 --> 02:10.200]  White House, the United Nations, Time Magazine, the New York Times, Cass Sunstein, Bill Gates
[02:10.200 --> 02:15.800]  are all saying how great censorship is and how we need it here, and how you need an Internet
[02:15.800 --> 02:25.320]  ID where every time you log on under federal law, you are tracked, guilty until proven innocent,
[02:25.320 --> 02:28.240]  and where they want new taxes on the Internet.
[02:28.240 --> 02:36.000]  And under the Cybersecurity Bill that passed the House on Friday, we've read over this
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.800]  bill before, the House version, the Senate's even worse, it openly says all ISP companies,
[02:43.800 --> 02:50.560]  even down to small resellers, have to put government, hardware, and software in where
[02:50.560 --> 02:58.080]  everything is tracked even at the local level, not just at the central hubs.
[02:58.080 --> 03:03.680]  You get jail time if you don't do this, and it recruits kids out of schools, high schools
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.400]  and colleges to man these, and Obama says they may shut the web down to, quote, protect
[03:09.400 --> 03:12.080]  it.
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.040]  This is the total takeover of the Internet, and because it's sophisticated and multifaceted
[03:18.040 --> 03:22.800]  on many fronts, most people don't get it.
[03:22.800 --> 03:29.720]  But the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, CNET News, other techies, they understand exactly
[03:29.720 --> 03:37.960]  what is happening.
[03:37.960 --> 03:45.720]  And if we just go quietly into the night, if we don't get upset over what's happening,
[03:45.720 --> 03:50.280]  if we don't get the word out and educate people about what's happening, we're going to lose
[03:50.280 --> 03:57.840]  the Internet as we know it.
[03:57.840 --> 04:05.320]  We are going to lose the web as we know it, and it is going to be the worldwide web, as
[04:05.320 --> 04:13.720]  the NSA originally called it in the 60s and 70s, worldwide wiretap for them instead of
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.360]  an engine of liberty.
[04:15.360 --> 04:22.200]  It is an inanimate tool like a gun or a hammer to be used for good or bad, and they want
[04:22.200 --> 04:24.440]  to use it for bad.
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.880]  Mainstream News is admitting that now, even in the U.S., the swine flu situation was a
[04:28.880 --> 04:29.880]  hoax.
[04:29.880 --> 04:31.040]  That's coming up.
[04:31.040 --> 04:33.320]  Sarah Palin is worse than I first thought.
[04:33.320 --> 04:35.360]  I mean, I've got to break her down.
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.360]  Endorsing Rick Perry over Deborah Medina saying Hill Sin Washington a message, her bizarre
[04:40.360 --> 04:48.800]  Tea Party speech that I'm still reeling from, the fact that Tea Party Nation is an wholly
[04:48.800 --> 04:53.880]  owned subsidiary of Mr. Steele and the Republicans.
[04:53.880 --> 05:00.040]  I mean, this is serious business, and we're also going to get into new Mayak info.
[05:00.040 --> 05:03.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[05:03.760 --> 05:08.080]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[05:08.080 --> 05:09.080]  do you want?
[05:09.080 --> 05:11.120]  My answer would be all I can get.
[05:11.120 --> 05:16.160]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[05:16.160 --> 05:17.400]  How much do you want?
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.400]  When do you want it?
[05:18.400 --> 05:20.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[05:20.440 --> 05:21.560]  When will you need it?
[05:21.560 --> 05:23.680]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.000]  Will there be any food?
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.480]  Will it make your children sick?
[05:26.480 --> 05:30.600]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[05:30.600 --> 05:31.760]  and be immunized?
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.560]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[05:35.560 --> 05:39.120]  It is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[05:39.120 --> 05:40.360]  How much will you need?
[05:40.360 --> 05:41.360]  We don't know.
[05:41.360 --> 05:42.360]  How much do you want?
[05:42.360 --> 05:43.360]  All you can get.
[05:43.360 --> 05:44.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:44.360 --> 05:47.400]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[05:47.400 --> 05:54.840]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:54.840 --> 06:02.240]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[06:02.240 --> 06:06.040]  Residents of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[06:06.040 --> 06:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[06:09.200 --> 06:13.560]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.560]  at home.
[06:14.560 --> 06:19.680]  We have a tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the
[06:19.680 --> 06:20.680]  shots.
[06:20.680 --> 06:25.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:25.520 --> 06:31.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.640]  held bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.640 --> 06:40.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[06:40.040 --> 06:42.200]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[06:42.200 --> 06:47.560]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[06:47.560 --> 06:49.400]  a fall of the Republic.
[06:49.400 --> 06:55.240]  Yet your copy, A Fall of the Republic, on DVD at infowars.com, we're watching online
[06:55.240 --> 07:02.240]  right now, in super high quality, at prisonplanet.tv.
[07:55.240 --> 08:10.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.160]  You want answers?
[08:11.160 --> 08:19.680]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[08:19.680 --> 08:25.520]  is Alex Jones.
[08:25.520 --> 08:34.240]  Well, the takeover of the Tea Party movement is worse than I even thought it would be early
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.240]  on.
[08:35.240 --> 08:36.240]  It is complete.
[08:36.240 --> 08:41.920]  It is total Tea Party nation.
[08:41.920 --> 08:48.360]  It's just like the Fox Nation website that's designed to look like infowars.com, and basically
[08:48.360 --> 08:53.560]  mimics and twist everything we do here as true constitutionalists.
[08:53.560 --> 09:04.760]  I watched her 55-minute-long speech on C-SPAN YouTube yesterday morning, and she endorsed
[09:04.760 --> 09:06.320]  war.
[09:06.320 --> 09:07.920]  She endorsed the Patriot Act.
[09:07.920 --> 09:16.280]  She said to TV cameras after her speech that we need a president, not a constitutional
[09:16.280 --> 09:25.000]  lawyer, so she likes to, oh, there's no other word, she likes to urinate on the Constitution.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.080]  That is America, which, get it through your gun-grabbing head.
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.640]  And, yes, she was picked by John McCain, who's a gun-grabber.
[09:35.640 --> 09:39.720]  John McCain picked her because she's a minion of Henry Kissinger.
[09:39.720 --> 09:43.920]  She will betray you, get ready for it.
[09:43.920 --> 09:51.960]  You know, I've got to make the hard calls here early on, just like I went after Obama,
[09:51.960 --> 09:56.120]  the day he was elected, and said he's going to go back on every promise he's made.
[09:56.120 --> 10:01.200]  He's a complete fraud, and that was not the popular thing to do.
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.960]  I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[10:06.960 --> 10:08.600]  I'm trying to save this country.
[10:08.600 --> 10:13.360]  If a terror attack is staged, I come out and report it staged.
[10:13.360 --> 10:17.720]  I don't care if it's unpopular early on, because as Mark Twain said in the beginning,
[10:17.720 --> 10:23.520]  a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds,
[10:23.520 --> 10:33.000]  the timid joined him because then it cost nothing to be a patriot.
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.760]  We cover the issues.
[10:34.760 --> 10:36.420]  We do the research.
[10:36.420 --> 10:39.320]  We have the facts.
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.560]  I told you they were going to launch a flu hysteria in January of last year, over a
[10:43.560 --> 10:47.200]  year ago.
[10:47.200 --> 10:49.900]  Three months later, it started.
[10:49.900 --> 10:51.240]  We didn't just have intel.
[10:51.240 --> 10:55.400]  We had the secret documents from Indiana and New York state, what the feds were getting
[10:55.400 --> 10:57.640]  ready to do.
[10:57.640 --> 11:00.840]  We broke the MIAC report, the Homeland Security Reports.
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.480]  For four or five days, people thought we'd made fake, secret documents up.
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.000]  They were too lazy to call the stinking phone numbers to the FBI and the Missouri state
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.200]  police on the documents.
[11:15.200 --> 11:20.520]  Some people are in denial about the fact that infowars.com and prisonplanet.com is being
[11:20.520 --> 11:25.520]  shut down by major ISPs all over the world.
[11:25.520 --> 11:32.520]  Doesn't matter if we have the letters from the ISPs, they're doing it.
[11:32.520 --> 11:34.720]  Stop living in denial.
[11:34.720 --> 11:39.800]  I get emails every day, people saying, oh, they've only gotten $700 billion, $784 billion.
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.800]  Alex, why are you saying $28 billion?
[11:41.800 --> 11:42.800]  I mean, $28 trillion.
[11:42.800 --> 11:43.800]  Excuse me.
[11:43.800 --> 11:44.800]  I can't even get these numbers.
[11:44.800 --> 11:45.800]  Right.
[11:45.800 --> 11:46.800]  They're so big.
[11:46.800 --> 11:50.160]  People go, there's only $784 billion, Alex.
[11:50.160 --> 11:53.080]  Why are you saying $28 trillion?
[11:53.080 --> 11:57.680]  Then I can play you MSNBC.
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.080]  Five months after I've been reporting, it's $23.7, now it's $28.
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.160]  They're finally reporting $23.7 trillion.
[12:05.160 --> 12:11.000]  We're only reporting the facts to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.320]  That's all we do here.
[12:15.320 --> 12:16.960]  We're in trouble.
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.600]  We have a corrupt government that's been hijacked by foreign banks.
[12:20.600 --> 12:23.240]  They're looting everybody right now.
[12:23.240 --> 12:30.880]  They're putting taxes on everything, from food to water to jacking up your property taxes
[12:30.880 --> 12:33.720]  to hiring more cops to go out and write tickets.
[12:33.720 --> 12:46.120]  Hell, here in Texas, a kid was drowning in a San Marcos river, and you're not supposed
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.000]  to swim by the waterfall, and a man jumped in and saved him, and they gave the guy a
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.280]  ticket and threatened to arrest him.
[12:54.280 --> 12:56.160]  That's the type of country we live in.
[12:56.160 --> 13:04.840]  That is what we have turned into, and it's sick, and it's wrong, and it's disgusting.
[13:04.840 --> 13:12.760]  Sarah Palin yesterday in Houston endorsed Rick Perry and said, send Washington a message.
[13:12.760 --> 13:14.720]  Re-elect Rick Perry.
[13:14.720 --> 13:21.080]  I mean, Rick Perry was for the banker bailout, and then now says he's against it.
[13:21.080 --> 13:28.800]  Rick Perry is the architect of handing 8,000 miles of Texas roads over to foreign corporations
[13:28.800 --> 13:38.400]  to put toll roads on him, and then he runs around saying he's against it.
[13:38.400 --> 13:44.280]  Rick Perry took money from Merck to go out and create a hoax two years ago and say it's
[13:44.280 --> 13:45.440]  the law.
[13:45.440 --> 13:48.680]  All girls must take Gardasil when there was no law.
[13:48.680 --> 13:53.120]  He as governor recommended to the state health department that it be on the list of recommended
[13:53.120 --> 13:56.240]  vaccines to attend schools.
[13:56.240 --> 13:57.400]  No law.
[13:57.400 --> 13:58.560]  It's all fraud.
[13:58.560 --> 14:07.200]  Kay Bailey Hutchinson is even worse if it could be possible.
[14:07.200 --> 14:14.320]  An actual member of the Bilderberg group, not just a member of the Bilderberg group, a member
[14:14.320 --> 14:22.400]  of the internal steering committee, Rick Perry is an attendee.
[14:22.400 --> 14:28.960]  If Sarah Palin was really the leader of the real Tea Party, she would have endorsed Deborah
[14:28.960 --> 14:35.760]  Medina, who's gaining about five points a week in the polls.
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.960]  She was 5%, then 10%, then 15%.
[14:38.960 --> 14:47.400]  Now in most polls, above 21%, racing against Kay Bailey's 30-something and Perry's 40-something.
[14:47.400 --> 14:50.120]  She's taking away from both of them.
[14:50.120 --> 14:56.120]  If Sarah Palin really wanted to lead a revolution against tyranny, she would endorse somebody
[14:56.120 --> 15:00.800]  who would secure the Texas borders, somebody who would get rid of the property tax, somebody
[15:00.800 --> 15:08.640]  who would push in the legislature for Vermont and Nevada-style open carry, who would truly
[15:08.640 --> 15:18.560]  restore the state, who would go up against the cities that are sanctuaries, where the
[15:18.560 --> 15:23.880]  illegals are allowed to drunk drive, not have driver's license or insurance.
[15:23.880 --> 15:30.000]  I've talked to Austin police, I've talked to, I won't even say county or city, I talked
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.200]  to a high-powered investigator clerk, I'll just leave it at that.
[15:36.200 --> 15:41.320]  It's the same thing I've been told and I've seen in the news, 60-plus percent conservatively
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.160]  of all crimes in Travis County are committed by illegal aliens, because they're above
[15:45.160 --> 15:46.160]  the law.
[15:46.160 --> 15:47.160]  Why not?
[15:47.160 --> 15:54.840]  Every criminal from Mexico comes up here and they give them, it was $50 fines a few
[15:54.840 --> 16:01.560]  years ago for EWI, the average Texan gets a year in jail, $5,000, $10,000 fines.
[16:01.560 --> 16:05.200]  Now they give them $1 fines.
[16:05.200 --> 16:09.200]  We need real reporters to go into these sanctuary cities everywhere and watch the illegals brought
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.200]  up.
[16:10.200 --> 16:12.440]  Oh, but that'd be politically incorrect and show how they're above the law.
[16:12.440 --> 16:18.200]  Oh, here's your $1 fine for drunk driving.
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.000]  The police, until a few years ago, would still arrest them, they're told just release them.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.600]  ICE won't come pick them up.
[16:25.600 --> 16:31.000]  My point is Debra Medina will do something about that, but no, Sarah Palin up there and
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.840]  she was so uncomfortable because she knew there were real patriots in the room.
[16:34.840 --> 16:38.640]  This woman is a nightmare, just like Glenn Beck, but you don't care.
[16:38.640 --> 16:40.760]  You like being conned, some of you out there.
[16:40.760 --> 16:42.680]  You're just like Obama supporters.
[16:42.680 --> 16:45.320]  There isn't a scam you won't buy into.
[16:45.320 --> 16:48.160]  There isn't a fraud you won't buy into.
[16:48.160 --> 16:58.200]  There isn't a ticket to be bamboozled that you won't buy.
[16:58.200 --> 17:01.920]  Great article from the Nashville Post, beginning of the end, Sarah Palin hijacked the Tea
[17:01.920 --> 17:04.720]  Party Movement, linked up at infowars.com.
[17:04.720 --> 17:05.720]  Here's another one.
[17:05.720 --> 17:10.200]  Palin brings out crowd for Perry, rally near Houston, Dallas Morning News, we've got the
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.760]  video coming up later where she endorses Rick Perry.
[17:14.760 --> 17:21.960]  Here's another one from Ross Story, Palin, war with Iran would help Obama's reelection.
[17:21.960 --> 17:26.360]  How many neocon publications last week called for war with Iran and said that's your only
[17:26.360 --> 17:29.680]  hope Obama three.
[17:29.680 --> 17:32.240]  That's a talking point now.
[17:32.240 --> 17:33.240]  Listen to this.
[17:33.240 --> 17:36.960]  President Obama won't be reelected in 2012 unless he can toughen up on national security.
[17:36.960 --> 17:41.120]  We're going to Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, believes that declaring war on
[17:41.120 --> 17:43.600]  Iran could help the president get reelected.
[17:43.600 --> 17:45.320]  Say this is a quote from her.
[17:45.320 --> 17:50.080]  Say he decided to declare war on Iran and decided really to come out and do what he
[17:50.080 --> 17:51.400]  could do to support Israel.
[17:51.400 --> 17:54.200]  Yeah, let's declare war on Iran.
[17:54.200 --> 17:58.880]  I mean, this woman is a loose cannon lunatic.
[17:58.880 --> 18:02.400]  Obama's already massing troops and aircraft carriers and missile systems and they are
[18:02.400 --> 18:04.560]  getting ready.
[18:04.560 --> 18:09.840]  So they give him left cover by saying he isn't doing enough invading Yemen and Pakistan and
[18:09.840 --> 18:14.440]  in 35,000 more trips and in Afghanistan.
[18:14.440 --> 18:23.960]  It's not enough and we need the Patriot Act and we need torture and we need secret arrest.
[18:23.960 --> 18:28.160]  Listen to her say he does this a quote say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided
[18:28.160 --> 18:31.400]  really to come out and do whatever he could to support Israel.
[18:31.400 --> 18:35.920]  And I like him to do it, which I would like him to do.
[18:35.920 --> 18:36.920]  That's a quote.
[18:36.920 --> 18:37.920]  Let me read that for you.
[18:37.920 --> 18:38.920]  It's so stunning.
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.080]  I'm stumbling over it.
[18:40.080 --> 18:45.400]  Say he decided to declare war on Iran or decided really to come out and do whatever he could
[18:45.400 --> 18:47.840]  to support Israel, which I would like him to do.
[18:47.840 --> 18:54.240]  Palin told Fox News, Chris Wallace Sunday that changes the dynamics in which we assume is
[18:54.240 --> 18:59.240]  going to happen between now and three years.
[18:59.240 --> 19:01.640]  She went on to say play the war card.
[19:01.640 --> 19:07.040]  That's a quote to help his 2012 bid.
[19:07.040 --> 19:08.880]  The war card.
[19:08.880 --> 19:15.720]  I mean, we're already known as the, as the new Soviets, the new Nazis in America.
[19:15.720 --> 19:18.520]  Go into Iran, declare war.
[19:18.520 --> 19:21.960]  Hey, lady, they haven't declared war since World War Two.
[19:21.960 --> 19:26.520]  They have all these illegal wars.
[19:26.520 --> 19:32.240]  And you've now got Tea Party Nation run and funded by the RNC, paying her all this money
[19:32.240 --> 19:34.760]  to go speak.
[19:34.760 --> 19:38.720]  And of course, the media says, oh, there's infighting in the Tea Parties.
[19:38.720 --> 19:45.040]  No, the Tea Parties a year ago in Texas were booing Cornyn and Perry and other neocons.
[19:45.040 --> 19:49.440]  And it was taken over by the Republicans and the Democrats helped the hoax, saying it was
[19:49.440 --> 19:51.680]  a Republican operation from the beginning.
[19:51.680 --> 19:54.160]  And the Republicans did come in and take it over.
[19:54.160 --> 20:00.560]  So in three years, you'll just get raped just as bad, just like the Obama idiots.
[20:00.560 --> 20:05.800]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters, thinking of calling a debt relief
[20:05.800 --> 20:06.800]  company?

[22:01.760 --> 22:05.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[22:05.520 --> 22:08.680]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[22:08.680 --> 22:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[22:13.000 --> 22:14.000]  at home.
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.680]  They've turned tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are
[22:18.680 --> 22:19.680]  calling the shots.
[22:19.680 --> 22:25.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.480]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.160]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[22:35.160 --> 22:37.600]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[22:37.600 --> 22:41.560]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[22:41.560 --> 22:47.560]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[22:47.560 --> 22:48.560]  of the Republic.

[24:09.720 --> 24:15.560]  Do you hear Sarah Palin saying remove the naked body scanners like True Tea Party Libertarians
[24:15.560 --> 24:19.120]  and Ron Paul?
[24:19.120 --> 24:24.640]  Do you hear Sarah Palin calling for repeal of gun laws?
[24:24.640 --> 24:26.040]  No.
[24:26.040 --> 24:28.760]  Do you hear her coming out against the North American Union?
[24:28.760 --> 24:30.260]  No.
[24:30.260 --> 24:35.680]  All she's done is come out against the government takeover of healthcare and a little bit on
[24:35.680 --> 24:38.320]  the carbon tax.
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.760]  And she is a horrible speaker when it's not off a teleprompter and looks like a clown.
[24:42.760 --> 24:45.080]  So let me tell you how this is going to work.
[24:45.080 --> 24:52.760]  She is being positioned and being built up just like they did early on with McCain to
[24:52.760 --> 25:00.320]  then be torn down in two and a half years so that you get Barack Obama again, you fools.
[25:00.320 --> 25:06.080]  You moron Republican Party rhino bootlickers, all you people that love to go to Republican
[25:06.080 --> 25:13.040]  Party functions and be snowed, be scammed, wake up.
[25:13.040 --> 25:15.720]  It's the same thing with Glenn Beck.
[25:15.720 --> 25:19.280]  They're only trying to get your confidence.
[25:19.280 --> 25:21.280]  They are going to continue the agenda.
[25:21.280 --> 25:29.280]  Obama has continued the Bush agenda who continue the Clinton agenda because there's no difference.
[25:29.280 --> 25:36.720]  And the tea parties were started by 9 11 truth five years ago and picked up in 2007 by the
[25:36.720 --> 25:39.640]  Ron Paul supporters at campuses.
[25:39.640 --> 25:43.000]  We called it a tea party in Austin.
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.720]  The first tea party, the proto tea party was three years ago in Austin.
[25:49.720 --> 25:58.040]  Over a thousand people marching downtown a year ago, they were booing Republicans nationwide
[25:58.040 --> 26:00.720]  who tried to come take over the tea parties early on.
[26:00.720 --> 26:06.640]  So they sent in rock stars, Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and a bunch of
[26:06.640 --> 26:10.120]  people took the bait and boy, did you take it.
[26:10.120 --> 26:13.880]  And now there's an internal fight within the tea party.
[26:13.880 --> 26:15.680]  Don't let them co-opt you.
[26:15.680 --> 26:22.320]  You go in there and educate these numbskulls.
[26:22.320 --> 26:26.840]  Now coming up later in the broadcast, I'm going to play clips of Palin and break it
[26:26.840 --> 26:30.240]  down.
[26:30.240 --> 26:40.800]  We've also got constitutional lawyer Gary Fielder coming on the show in Colorado and
[26:40.800 --> 26:41.800]  other states.
[26:41.800 --> 26:44.140]  They're putting naked body scanners in the courts.
[26:44.140 --> 26:47.600]  And if you're even a lawyer that practices there, you've got to have your genitals recorded
[26:47.600 --> 26:48.600]  by them.
[26:48.600 --> 26:51.920]  And he took a hidden camera and he's coming up for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[26:51.920 --> 26:56.640]  And then Michael Springman for 30 minutes in the hour after that dealing with the aftermath
[26:56.640 --> 26:59.200]  of the underwear bomber.
[26:59.200 --> 27:05.080]  And the parallels to when he was the head of the visa section of the U.S. Embassy in
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.520]  Saudi Arabia and when he was ordered to let them in, even though they were on terrorist
[27:09.520 --> 27:10.520]  watch list.
[27:10.520 --> 27:20.440]  And then later he was told the CIA was protecting him, Mohammed Atta and others.
[27:20.440 --> 27:22.120]  This isn't a joke.
[27:22.120 --> 27:27.320]  This isn't a game.
[27:27.320 --> 27:34.160]  This is serious.
[27:34.160 --> 27:37.800]  Now when we come back from break, I'm going to get into the censorship and the attack
[27:37.800 --> 27:39.320]  on the internet.
[27:39.320 --> 27:41.420]  It is massive.
[27:41.420 --> 27:43.180]  It is coordinated.
[27:43.180 --> 27:50.840]  It is being tested with Google announcing their now for censorship in the U.S. with Microsoft
[27:50.840 --> 27:55.720]  announcing it, with the U.N. announcing it, with Time Magazine, the New York Times, all
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.640]  their organs announcing it saying it's in the name of security.
[27:59.640 --> 28:06.560]  We happen to have the cybersecurity bill here.
[28:06.560 --> 28:14.480]  We're going to go over it.
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.840]  And we're going to get into Palin and another incredible story.
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.040]  This is from Raw Story and this itself is a whitewash.
[28:24.040 --> 28:27.920]  I actually went and read the filing.
[28:27.920 --> 28:29.400]  No joke is the headline.
[28:29.400 --> 28:33.160]  South Carolina now requires subversives to register.
[28:33.160 --> 28:38.600]  And the media is acting like this is a joke saying, well, a law saying if you're a terrorist
[28:38.600 --> 28:43.280]  and want to overthrow the government, you've got to come register or you get all this prison
[28:43.280 --> 28:50.560]  time, 10 years in prison, $25,000 fine.
[28:50.560 --> 28:55.640]  When you read the fine print, this is anybody listed by the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center
[28:55.640 --> 29:03.280]  or by the Virginia Fusion Center Mayak Report, their state's equivalent of Mayak, listing
[29:03.280 --> 29:09.760]  gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, returning veterans as the number one enemy.
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.560]  They consider it terrorism to say we have an illegitimate government in Washington and
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.320]  it has to be removed and that we've got to have the states stand up against this system.
[29:20.320 --> 29:23.520]  It's the same thing Hitler did.
[29:23.520 --> 29:30.080]  He said show up and register yourself.
[29:30.080 --> 29:36.080]  And in in-game blueprint for global enslavement, we talk about the elite's white papers of
[29:36.080 --> 29:38.680]  why they're trying to set up this world government.
[29:38.680 --> 29:44.840]  What is the repercussions of the in-game?
[29:44.840 --> 29:47.680]  I'll tell you about that when we come back as well.
[29:47.680 --> 29:50.960]  Stay with us.
[29:50.960 --> 29:52.240]  We're on the march.
[29:52.240 --> 29:54.640]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.640 --> 30:00.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.520 --> 30:01.600]  What's your home worth?
[30:01.600 --> 30:03.720]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[30:03.720 --> 30:06.720]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?

[31:20.480 --> 31:25.600]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[31:25.600 --> 31:29.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.800]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[31:34.800 --> 31:35.800]  world government.
[31:35.800 --> 31:40.160]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[31:40.160 --> 31:42.200]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[31:42.200 --> 31:48.200]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[31:48.200 --> 31:49.560]  of the Republic.
[31:49.560 --> 31:55.640]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com, we're watching online right
[31:55.640 --> 32:00.880]  now in super high quality at PrismPlanet.tv.
[32:00.880 --> 32:05.040]  Before you throw away your used batteries you need to listen to this, now going green
[32:05.040 --> 32:06.240]  can save money.
[32:06.240 --> 32:10.280]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with

[32:57.720 --> 33:04.520]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[33:04.520 --> 33:26.500]  Thank you.
[33:26.500 --> 33:43.320]  Here is the Wired Magazine article and I actually printed off the 100 plus page DARPA report.
[33:43.320 --> 33:47.300]  I tried to scan over it this morning.
[33:47.300 --> 33:57.180]  Pentagon looks to breed immortal synthetic organisms, molecular kill switch included.
[33:57.180 --> 34:01.820]  Now this is the type of stuff already being engineered into thousands of pharmacological
[34:01.820 --> 34:05.660]  crop varieties and open-air planet.
[34:05.660 --> 34:12.740]  You want to talk about real potential for environmental catastrophe, this is it.
[34:12.740 --> 34:17.740]  And don't worry the UN and your local governments are going to tax you for carbon dioxide that
[34:17.740 --> 34:21.940]  plants breathe.
[34:21.940 --> 34:26.860]  And they're going to continue using DU and dioxins and everything else that actually
[34:26.860 --> 34:31.340]  hurt humanity.
[34:31.340 --> 34:37.300]  But I guess that doesn't matter because the saints won the Super Bowl and the news says
[34:37.300 --> 34:41.580]  everyone is euphoric and now New Orleans is okay.
[34:41.580 --> 34:43.760]  Even though the city is still devastated, it doesn't matter.
[34:43.760 --> 34:46.580]  They had this big win.
[34:46.580 --> 34:51.860]  Doesn't matter if their kids are eating GMO crops that kill the rats that eat it.
[34:51.860 --> 34:58.980]  It doesn't matter if your little kid may roll over and die from all the stuff they're eating
[34:58.980 --> 35:06.460]  and the melamine and 90% according to the Associated Press of the baby formula.
[35:06.460 --> 35:08.300]  That doesn't matter.
[35:08.300 --> 35:15.300]  I'm bad because I'm trying to get people to focus into issues I think are important.
[35:15.300 --> 35:18.300]  Everybody knows your baby eating poison isn't important.
[35:18.300 --> 35:22.980]  Everybody knows Mercury's good for you as the national news now says.
[35:22.980 --> 35:30.700]  Everybody knows all that matters is the saints won last night.
[35:30.700 --> 35:34.700]  Forget the real world going on around you, all the Buck Rogers high tech stuff being
[35:34.700 --> 35:37.180]  developed to control your life.
[35:37.180 --> 35:45.620]  Forget the fact that the elite openly say from Ray Kurzweil to Prince Philip that they're
[35:45.620 --> 35:51.140]  going to set up a world government and kill most of us so that they can have all the advanced
[35:51.140 --> 35:54.660]  life extension technologies.
[35:54.660 --> 35:58.820]  Now whether they're going to attain this or not is not the issue.
[35:58.820 --> 36:04.620]  The issue is these people are out of control.
[36:04.620 --> 36:10.460]  And they don't want humans who have their head screwed on straight who understand what's
[36:10.460 --> 36:15.780]  going on to warn the people or to have an open debate about real issues.
[36:15.780 --> 36:20.940]  They want you to sit there and watch your football game and eat your GMO corn and let
[36:20.940 --> 36:27.300]  your body rot and let your liver and kidneys fail and let you get leukemia.
[36:27.300 --> 36:32.980]  And they want the soldiers to come home who've been breathing DU and roll over and die.
[36:32.980 --> 36:37.180]  And they want us all to just sit there like a bunch of fools.
[36:37.180 --> 36:38.500]  I listen to men.
[36:38.500 --> 36:44.460]  They're like a bunch of babies in this country, a bunch of immature, giggling, gibbering 10
[36:44.460 --> 36:45.860]  year olds.
[36:45.860 --> 36:52.220]  Women are like a bunch of little girls.
[36:52.220 --> 36:56.180]  They've taken all of your weaknesses and turned them against you folks.
[36:56.180 --> 37:01.060]  We're in trouble.
[37:01.060 --> 37:06.620]  We have the government hiring the most corrupt sociopathic control freaks you can imagine
[37:06.620 --> 37:13.660]  at every level to carry out their criminal operations.
[37:13.660 --> 37:20.220]  The world has cancer.
[37:20.220 --> 37:23.260]  And it's only going to get worse.
[37:23.260 --> 37:29.040]  Every possible future that I have projected into the future and studied along the lines
[37:29.040 --> 37:46.060]  of information and the current progression of human society lead to Armageddon like ramifications.
[37:46.060 --> 37:59.960]  Like engineering, pharmacological crops, chimera, cross species, hybrids, alone are the equivalent
[37:59.960 --> 38:08.340]  of a trillion megaton nuke that could go off any time in our society.
[38:08.340 --> 38:13.940]  For those that don't know, a trillion megaton nuke would destroy the entire planet and turn
[38:13.940 --> 38:22.640]  it into another asteroid belt.
[38:22.640 --> 38:31.960]  Guaranteed, ladies and gentlemen, that we are already seeing horrible aftermath of unchecked
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.240]  genetic engineering.
[38:36.240 --> 38:44.040]  Guaranteed, the illnesses, the cancers, the sicknesses, the allergies, and that's only
[38:44.040 --> 38:45.880]  one small area.
[38:45.880 --> 38:52.800]  Giant cyclotrons like the Hadron supercollider, their own math equations say it could create
[38:52.800 --> 39:05.560]  a singularity, a strangelot, and that that's what they're trying to create.
[39:05.560 --> 39:08.040]  Have you seen the new Star Trek movie?
[39:08.040 --> 39:10.320]  We talked about this years before that movie.
[39:10.320 --> 39:15.680]  But if you notice how the Romulan destroys planets, that's what we're talking about.
[39:15.680 --> 39:20.420]  That's exactly what it will look like, except that in the average equation it will take
[39:20.420 --> 39:27.960]  40 years for the strangelot that sinks to the center of the earth to divide up to the
[39:27.960 --> 39:32.480]  point of where it could even be seen by an electron microscope, then it will take a few
[39:32.480 --> 39:36.480]  hours to become the size of Texas.
[39:36.480 --> 39:46.720]  It will take a few minutes to then destroy the earth after that.
[39:46.720 --> 39:56.680]  The majority of the scientists who tested the ABOM secretly in the western deserts of
[39:56.680 --> 40:03.480]  the United States thought that it would ignite the atmosphere, and they made bizarre recordings
[40:03.480 --> 40:12.320]  about I am Shiva, the God of Death, before they detonated it.
[40:12.320 --> 40:18.480]  They have Shiva, I know you think Kali is the God of Death, but Shiva also is the God
[40:18.480 --> 40:24.400]  of Death, the God of Destruction actually to be more precise, excuse me.
[40:24.400 --> 40:33.280]  They have Shiva, the God of Destruction, the God of tectonic forces in a giant idol above
[40:33.280 --> 40:40.400]  Hadron in Switzerland.
[40:40.400 --> 40:47.760]  Have you read the poetry of the elite?
[40:47.760 --> 40:57.120]  Have you read what the futurist and transhumanist write about?
[40:57.120 --> 40:59.480]  Do you know who these people are?
[40:59.480 --> 41:03.280]  You better find out quick.
[41:03.280 --> 41:07.760]  All you little tough guy cops who think you've got it all figured out, you're part of the
[41:07.760 --> 41:11.000]  system and you've got all this power.
[41:11.000 --> 41:24.200]  You are just like everybody else, and the New World Order hates your guts.
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.760]  I actually care about you and want you to find humanity, and I want all the slack-jawed
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.880]  people in the public to find their humanity and to pull their head out of the ground and
[41:33.880 --> 41:38.480]  look around them.
[41:38.480 --> 41:53.760]  The elite are in a race with each other to develop super weapons, life extension technologies,
[41:53.760 --> 41:59.240]  high tech systems of control.
[41:59.240 --> 42:05.200]  Do you have any idea how dangerous an immortal microorganism is?
[42:05.200 --> 42:12.600]  And yes, they can go in a decade ago at least, and they can go into bacteria, and they can
[42:12.600 --> 42:18.480]  go into viruses, and they can go into other microplasms, and they can make them for all
[42:18.480 --> 42:21.800]  intents and purposes.
[42:21.800 --> 42:24.440]  They can already make undead pigs.
[42:24.440 --> 42:27.560]  That's the Associated Press, did you know that?
[42:27.560 --> 42:28.560]  Undead.
[42:28.560 --> 42:43.160]  They've got robots that eat dead bodies that can go for a hundred years, hunter killers.
[42:43.160 --> 42:47.080]  Remember that on Fox News?
[42:47.080 --> 42:53.680]  Do you have any idea of the fact that within a decade they plan to replace all of the combat
[42:53.680 --> 43:01.080]  aircraft with drones? Within four years, they want half of them replaced, and they are replacing
[43:01.080 --> 43:03.520]  them.
[43:03.520 --> 43:08.720]  By 2025, they want more than half the ground forces to be robots.
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.720]  They already have them.
[43:13.720 --> 43:19.120]  That means the elite can launch giant attacks on whoever they want, whenever they want,
[43:19.120 --> 43:24.240]  even if the troops say no.
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.920]  Do you have any idea the type of world we're going into?
[43:28.920 --> 43:32.760]  I hope you do.
[43:32.760 --> 43:39.560]  And when you start researching this, you're not going to care about the Super Bowl anymore.
[43:39.560 --> 43:46.160]  You're not going to care about if you've got a zit on your face anymore.
[43:46.160 --> 43:50.480]  I mean, not just the horrible things in life, but the fact that we're on a beautiful planet
[43:50.480 --> 43:55.000]  spinning through space and can look at other planets, hundreds of millions and millions
[43:55.000 --> 44:02.560]  of miles away, and stars, trillions of miles away, and just the gorgeousness of everything,
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.440]  the beauty of life on this planet, and everything that is good.
[44:07.440 --> 44:12.080]  It is so amazing to be part of this.
[44:12.080 --> 44:20.440]  And so they build the internet grid, DARPA does, same folks coming out with the synthetic
[44:20.440 --> 44:29.440]  immortality genes.
[44:29.440 --> 44:32.360]  They don't want you looking into all of this.
[44:32.360 --> 44:38.840]  They want you petty, ready to put your children through naked body scanners because some imaginary
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.240]  boogeyman might blow your plane up.
[44:43.240 --> 44:46.720]  When you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning twice in the same year, that's
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.720]  a real statistic, than dying from terror attacks.
[44:50.720 --> 44:51.720]  It's a joke.
[44:51.720 --> 44:53.280]  They treat you like children.
[44:53.280 --> 44:57.080]  You better be good or the boogeyman will get you.
[44:57.080 --> 45:00.640]  And so they've gotten everybody addicted to the internet, and now they're in the process
[45:00.640 --> 45:08.520]  of incrementally shutting it down, just like they shut everything else down incrementally.
[45:08.520 --> 45:10.000]  They know how you work.
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.160]  They know what makes you tick, and they're manipulating you.
[45:13.160 --> 45:18.920]  Let me read this article from Paul Joseph Watson at prisonplanet.com.
[45:18.920 --> 45:24.200]  I'm asking everyone to get this article and to get it out to everybody they know, because
[45:24.200 --> 45:30.640]  in this one article, three pages long, it gives you a good quick thumbnail snapshot of
[45:30.640 --> 45:35.720]  the current attack on the internet.
[45:35.720 --> 45:41.400]  And what's happening to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[45:41.400 --> 45:48.160]  Frightening taste of internet censorship as major free speech websites blocked.
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.640]  An ominous preview of what a government regulated worldwide web would look like as info wars
[45:53.640 --> 46:01.160]  and prisonplanet go dark in New Zealand.
[46:01.160 --> 46:08.520]  In areas of Italy, China, England, Canada, the US, Australia.
[46:08.520 --> 46:15.200]  With influential proponents recently calling for a newly regulated worldwide web, we got
[46:15.200 --> 46:19.800]  a preview of how that might look this past weekend.
[46:19.800 --> 46:25.640]  After both infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, I'm going to report this for two weeks.
[46:25.640 --> 46:27.120]  The problem is I've even been ignoring it.
[46:27.120 --> 46:29.960]  I'm becoming acclimated.
[46:29.960 --> 46:34.640]  Were completely blocked to many internet users in New Zealand and that's now confirmed by
[46:34.640 --> 46:37.760]  the ISPs.
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.800]  The block was only removed early this morning following a raft of complaints after both
[46:43.800 --> 46:50.240]  websites were unavailable on many ISPs since Friday.
[46:50.240 --> 46:57.200]  As the New Zealand based info news website reported yesterday, both of Alex Jones flagship
[46:57.200 --> 47:02.840]  websites were blocked by ISPs using asian.com, the main supplier of foreign internet traffic
[47:02.840 --> 47:06.200]  to New Zealand for their international internet traffic.
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.280]  It is important to stress that we receive emails on a weekly basis informing us that
[47:10.280 --> 47:16.280]  our websites have been blocked as hate speech or offensive material at internet cafes, libraries,
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.000]  transport hubs, workplaces and numerous other buildings not only in the United States but
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.600]  across the world.
[47:22.600 --> 47:26.440]  The censorship is being done at the ISP level.
[47:26.440 --> 47:34.200]  So whereas some people in a particular country will still have access, others will be blocked.
[47:34.200 --> 47:43.220]  As we reported in 2008, London's St. Panneris International which millions of people traveled
[47:43.220 --> 47:48.360]  across mainland Europe after every year completely blocks prisonplanet and info wars and even
[47:48.360 --> 47:52.240]  more mainstream political websites as a matter of course.
[47:52.240 --> 47:59.800]  In 2007, MySpace admitted, their policy was to censor and filter out post containing links
[47:59.800 --> 48:05.440]  to prisonplanet.com website adding that MySpace server automatically blocked such information.
[48:05.440 --> 48:09.840]  The social networking giant as well as others such as Facebook periodically blocked links
[48:09.840 --> 48:13.720]  to Alex Jones material and only revoked such filters when people complained.
[48:13.720 --> 48:22.480]  See they just keep pressing and pressing remember that white paper was in 2001 out of Chicago
[48:22.480 --> 48:30.360]  they had a biometric slash RFID conference and they said in there our studies show 87%
[48:30.360 --> 48:35.560]  of people don't like RFID and biometrics but our studies also show if we just keep pushing
[48:35.560 --> 48:39.160]  it they will submit that's a paraphrase they said the word submit.
[48:39.160 --> 48:44.400]  See they just keep coming back oh Ireland doesn't want to join the Euro keep coming
[48:44.400 --> 48:48.280]  back coming back coming back oh you don't want toll roads on all your major roads in
[48:48.280 --> 48:51.320]  Texas they just come back over and over and then say they're not going to do it and then
[48:51.320 --> 48:54.640]  put the toll roads in.
[48:54.640 --> 48:58.640]  They just don't stop and we can't stop.
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.320]  See they know you're going to get sick of seeing us blocked and complaining about it
[49:02.320 --> 49:09.520]  and then it'll just be well that's how it is remember when you can go to infowars.com
[49:09.520 --> 49:17.080]  so they only revoke it the blocks when you complain and what you do is you take this
[49:17.080 --> 49:22.080]  article today by Paul Watson you post it on every Facebook Twitter MySpace YouTube make
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.040]  videos about what's happening please.
[49:26.040 --> 49:30.560]  In 2005 Time Warner subscribers from New York California reported that their access to info
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.160]  wars in prison planet have been blocked due to hate speech before their access was restored.
[49:35.160 --> 49:44.760]  UK ISP Tiskali also blocked websites following 777 London bombings in 2005.
[49:44.760 --> 49:50.680]  Info war social network was also blocked by libraries in the US in 2008 using safe squad
[49:50.680 --> 49:53.200]  and Google filtering software.
[49:53.200 --> 49:57.880]  We receive numerous reports every single week of Alex Jones websites being blocked by ISPs
[49:57.880 --> 50:01.720]  and by filtering software and public buildings and what you do is you take screenshots of
[50:01.720 --> 50:05.320]  that put it on your Facebook your blog send it to us.
[50:05.320 --> 50:11.400]  We need total transparency on this.
[50:11.400 --> 50:16.000]  We receive numerous reports every single week that my websites are being blocked by ISPs
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.480]  and filtered software and public buildings and it continues we'll come back with the
[50:20.480 --> 50:24.920]  main meat of the article on the other side continue till five after the next two segments
[50:24.920 --> 50:28.760]  then we've got a guest coming on just fighting the tyranny at point like range that we can
[50:28.760 --> 50:33.240]  only commend and thank.

[54:41.440 --> 54:45.840]  in the last hour I want to go over the actual cybersecurity bill that passed the house it
[54:45.840 --> 54:52.400]  is now in the Senate and the draconian things that are in this continuing with the article
[54:52.400 --> 54:58.760]  quote an avid fan of info wars dot com and a 911 truth activists Jeff Mitchell reported
[54:58.760 --> 55:06.800]  on Saturday that he contacted his ISP or con to establish what was causing the block and
[55:06.800 --> 55:11.360]  was advised by a computer technician did a trace route that the break in traffic to the
[55:11.360 --> 55:17.000]  two websites was found to be occurring on Asia net coms router in Sydney this is not
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.840]  happening to other sites except for wiki leaks I should add that this is selective the websites
[55:21.840 --> 55:28.880]  were blocked on every ISP that relied on Asia net com and its upstream provider including
[55:28.880 --> 55:38.480]  whoosh telecom slingshot and or con and it goes on according to Duncan Blair head of brand
[55:38.480 --> 55:44.360]  and communications at Orion access to content hosted on the limelight content distribution
[55:44.360 --> 55:49.000]  network including info wars dot com and prison planet dot com was blocked as a result of
[55:49.000 --> 55:57.360]  a technical issue he says I'm the person who says I'm the person who half made the story
[55:57.360 --> 56:04.200]  possible by calling the ISP said Jeff Mitchell in a common on prison planet forum just want
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.840]  to report that info wars dot com is now working fine even though it was down all weekend we
[56:08.840 --> 56:20.040]  contacted the ISP and they were very concerned about censorship and it continues we complained
[56:20.040 --> 56:23.880]  to our ISP and they were very concerned about censorship that combined with this article
[56:23.880 --> 56:30.840]  on prison planet could very well have been the reason for us regaining access whether
[56:30.840 --> 56:35.960]  the problem was down to technical issues or deliberate censorship the fact that ISPs can
[56:35.960 --> 56:41.080]  selectively block certain websites at the flick of a switch gives us a frightening preview
[56:41.080 --> 56:45.480]  of what a Chinese style government regulated internet would look like which is exactly
[56:45.480 --> 56:50.280]  what influential insiders are calling for the move to impose centralized government
[56:50.280 --> 56:56.400]  control and regulation on the free internet has accelerated over the past 12 months last

[57:06.760 --> 57:13.120]  push for a system of even more stifling than the communist Chinese where only people with
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.080]  government permission would be allowed to express free speech which is not free speech
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.800]  during a recent conference at the Davos economic forum Monday chief research and strategy officer

[57:26.880 --> 57:31.600]  that the internet needed to be policed by means of introducing licenses similar to driver's
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.000]  license in other words government permission to use the web the New York Times also called
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.600]  for that a quote a kindler gentler internet internet censorship bills currently working
[57:40.600 --> 57:45.960]  their way into law in the UK Australia and the US legalize and legislate for government
[57:45.960 --> 57:51.080]  powers to restrict and filter any website it deems to be undesirable for public consumption

[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:43.720]  quote will have a place under the imaginable conditions according to the strategy to tell
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:48.440]  in the essay number one government might ban conspiracy theorizing number two government
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:53.000]  might impose some kind of tax financial or otherwise on those who disseminate such theories
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:58.120]  the ominous spectacle of major free speech websites going dark in supposedly democratic
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:04.160]  countries is a shocking portend of what the establishment wants to impose on widespread
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:09.120]  basis only by screaming bloody murder in defense of the last true outpost of free speech the
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:14.320]  internet and threatening boycotts and aggressive public relations campaigns can we counter the

[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:02.400]  we've got to pose as the conspiracy theorist to have credibility so we will pose as them
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:06.440]  and we've got them here locally identified we're going to be exposing them very soon
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:11.640]  oh yes they took the bait well and we've got them internationally exposed and they always

[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:35.960]  who runs the conspiracy instead of exposing the entire system and saying no to it but
[1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:43.000]  none of it's working they're going to fail new world order so you go ahead and try to

[1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:05.880]  subtitled and it's up at infowars.com we covered this a few weeks ago to our horror we learned
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:10.000]  that they're not just putting naked body scanners that record your genitals even the
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:17.520]  washington post admits top government scientist admit that these body scanners do cause cancer
[1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:24.880]  do damage your DNA that's mainstream news it's an act of submission an act of humiliation
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:30.240]  they also get a biometric 360 scan of your body which they then store so they have passive
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:36.080]  body scanners they admit this that can then scan through your clothes and tell who you
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:42.080]  are at a distance similar to a face scan remember I told you 14 years ago but they're taking
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:47.400]  all babies blood at birth now for 37 years in every western nation under a UN program
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:52.360]  now CNN came out this weekend and said yes your babies DNA is taken for law enforcement
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:58.280]  and for genetic engineering research I already have the internal documents but but but now
[1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:04.360]  it's mainstream news so they're recording your naked body they're lying about it in
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:09.680]  your face and they're saying they're gonna go in shopping malls courthouses they're

[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:09.480]  shot
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:14.280]  quarter million dollar machine takes three d images no it takes shots of your naked body
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:16.360]  it is the biometric scanner
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:18.640]  uh... tell us when you first learned of this
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:20.240]  and uh...
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:24.280]  i i guess now you're not allowed to practice in court are you filing a lawsuit
[1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:28.120]  your access to the courts have been violated because you won't give up your privacy
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:29.120]  tell us about it
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:33.560]  well it started about ten months ago when uh... they first put that
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:36.920]  machine and it was in the denver post and of course it was on uh...
[1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:38.160]  your news site
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:41.760]  and i just learned from your radio show you know the dangers of going through
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:43.480]  the scanner and
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:46.440]  and just the privacy invasion so i went down there
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:49.040]  fully expecting a reasonable offer
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.600]  uh... and this was probably two months before the video was shot
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:55.600]  i went down there's very nice i've been
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:56.800]  uh... practicing
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:00.360]  in the area for twenty years and i probably have one active case at all
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:01.760]  time it doesn't count
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:05.440]  so i go in there and i'm loading my stuff onto the conveyor belt and i just
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:06.240]  say hey
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:09.680]  i really don't want to do the scanner just like i said in the video very nice
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:10.600]  very professional
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:12.400]  is there some other alternative
[1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:14.640]  and the private security
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:15.800]  guard
[1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.200]  yes the sheriff's deputy will be out shortly
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:20.760]  uh... and i said okay fine so i had a
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:22.560]  waited for about five minutes
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:25.600]  the sheriff's deputy comes out and he says well the only alternative is the
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:26.720]  body search
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.760]  which i thought was a quick pat down and move on it
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:31.000]  i stood up
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:34.760]  he proceeded to then do a full body search
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:37.840]  uh... tight hands around both legs
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:43.000]  touched my crotch on the way up on the left leg on the way up on the right leg
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.320]  uh... tight around my arms
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:48.880]  turn around put his hands inside my jacket
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:50.720]  up and down my back
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:52.600]  uh... rubbed at my neck
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:54.920]  and across the shoulders
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:57.760]  and at and about halfway through i start talking i think
[1:13:57.760 --> 1:14:01.200]  you know this is really embarrassing for me why are you doing this
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:03.640]  uh... this absolutely necessary
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:06.760]  be quiet sit down and take your shoes off
[1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:10.320]  that sir this is really embarrassing i i don't know why i'm having to go through
[1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:12.760]  this take your shoes off
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:15.400]  why can i put up with it and i and i did it
[1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:18.520]  and i tried to speak with the judge about it no one really you know just
[1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.080]  pass the buck
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:20.800]  so
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:24.120]  three weeks went by and i had to go down there again and i just dreaded it i
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:26.080]  absolutely dreaded it
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:29.360]  so i went in the same thing i said hey can i just have you know i just
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:32.640]  don't you have a wand or something you know i mean i've been you know coming to
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.280]  courthouse forever
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:36.720]  so a sheriff's deputy will be right
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:38.960]  this time they come out
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:41.160]  and it's the full thing again
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:43.360]  except this time they're waiting for
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:46.280]  he ran his fingers through my hair
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:49.760]  he said open your mouth with a little small flashlight pulls out of his pocket
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:51.480]  but sir i'm not opening my mouth
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:53.480]  and then i just started talking loudly
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:55.720]  this is an absolute
[1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.000]  segregation of my right as a human being
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.440]  as a man standing here on this earth
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:03.920]  what are you people doing
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:07.920]  and and it was the same thing sit down shut up take your shoes off
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:08.840]  and so that was it
[1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:10.520]  uh... the next time i came out i
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:11.760]  i just said hey
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:13.840]  i'm not going through that scanner
[1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:15.480]  you're not touching me
[1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:17.760]  so get one of your wand get you know
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:20.160]  get somebody out here that knows what they're doing
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:22.960]  because i don't come to court to be touched by law enforcement
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:23.880]  i don't come
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:25.120]  to have
[1:15:25.120 --> 1:15:27.080]  picture taken up my body
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:29.600]  so they just turn me down they turn me away
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:32.920]  and i i thought well i'm gonna get creeped by my client i'm going to get
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:34.880]  found in contempt by the judge
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:37.640]  uh... and it was really embarrassing so the
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:39.320]  the guy that color we are changed
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:42.760]  found found out about it and they and they asked me to film
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.200]  so at first i was very hesitant but i i didn't want you know i didn't want to
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.880]  publicity i didn't want the
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:51.040]  situation but i realized that if somebody doesn't do something
[1:15:51.040 --> 1:15:54.880]  uh... that it was just going to continue so that was a real court date it was
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:56.560]  actually the resetting
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:15:59.480]  of the court date that they had denied me about two weeks
[1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:01.000]  uh... preview
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.880]  and you saw it i was very nice
[1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:06.400]  just wanted to be one just wanted to
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:08.280]  do something reasonable
[1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.400]  other than go through the scanner
[1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.760]  and uh... i was turned away again
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:15.080]  so at that point i was
[1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:18.400]  seriously contemplating filing for an injunction
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:21.040]  in the uh... federal court
[1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:23.200]  but i think the lightbulb went off
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:26.520]  uh... that they can't first of all they can't do this to mine
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:29.440]  it's a felony to take up a new photo of mine
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:32.040]  so they changed their policy with regard to mine
[1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:35.560]  now then they couldn't very well touch mine is like they touched me
[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:37.560]  and so they started wanting
[1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:39.800]  and so that was it then then after that
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:43.880]  it was hold on if you're going to want my you know you don't want me
[1:16:43.880 --> 1:16:48.280]  and so i went down there about i'd say three or four months after the video was shot
[1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:49.440]  and uh...
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:52.680]  and uh... you know they they they they did the warning procedure and then i was
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:55.240]  okay with that so i've been allowed to go back
[1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:56.520]  to douglas county
[1:16:56.520 --> 1:16:58.960]  uh... john the issue
[1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:02.760]  the issue here is and of course i want you to flesh out
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:05.000]  what you think the main issues are
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:06.440]  clearly
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:11.600]  they intensified the next body search to make it more harassing touching your
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:13.200]  genitals through your pants
[1:17:13.200 --> 1:17:15.320]  rubbing their hands through your hair
[1:17:15.320 --> 1:17:18.600]  your well-known respected lawyers practice there for years
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:20.360]  they knew
[1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:21.560]  exactly
[1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:24.360]  what they were doing and and their argument is well couple times a year
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:26.640]  somebody comes in the courthouse and shoots people
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.360]  well they could wait outside
[1:17:28.360 --> 1:17:32.520]  uh... for the judge in the parking lot are we going to put naked body scanners
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:35.240]  uh... it random checkpoints the answer is yes we're going to put them in
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:36.760]  shopping malls yes
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:39.280]  because everywhere has to be safe
[1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:40.760]  for the criminal government
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:43.880]  god forbid you just have the judge be armed and have some armed police in
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:44.440]  there
[1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:46.700]  that's not enough for them
[1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:50.560]  as the government gets more predatory it has to force us
[1:17:50.560 --> 1:17:51.800]  to submit
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:53.960]  to all their different forms and levels
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:58.000]  attorney but the good news here is you confronted them you showed it was
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:58.920]  illegal
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:02.240]  what they were doing and they had to back off now
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:03.800]  we need to get minors
[1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:06.360]  who were forced to be scanned through that
[1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:10.880]  uh... to start the subpoena process they will destroy the hard drives
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:13.120]  to show the child porn they produced
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:15.880]  we need to go ahead and get those men indicted
[1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:19.600]  i i think it uh... misdemeanor to unknowingly
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:20.440]  uh... take
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:24.840]  uh... naked photograph of an adult i've i've received some emails lately
[1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:28.600]  well looks counselor there are resting people for taking photos of their five
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:30.140]  year olds in bikinis now
[1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:32.240]  bikinis aren't legal
[1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:34.200]  all these tsa people
[1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:38.400]  and everybody at these courthouses doing this are now child pornographers i
[1:18:38.400 --> 1:18:40.520]  want them indicted for felonies
[1:18:40.520 --> 1:18:44.040]  i don't think there's any doubt about it i i just i i i couldn't believe it
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:45.480]  having to go through it
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:49.560]  and it would be very difficult if you were going to visit a relative or had
[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:51.800]  an important business meeting
[1:18:51.800 --> 1:18:54.500]  uh... to not get on an airplane but we have to do it
[1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:56.720]  we we have to write letters to the
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:18:59.640]  to the airlines we have to write letters to our mayor's
[1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:01.440]  a sheriff's governor's
[1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:03.120]  uh... i
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:05.440]  i only thought that it was a privacy effect
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:07.160]  i've since been advised

[1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:26.080]  in a pool and they said we don't care and you see these cases now they had one
[1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:30.600]  in Arizona last year where it was a two-year-old a three-year-old in their
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:36.480]  towels and and and they were crouched together you know hugging each other you
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:41.160]  go to jail they take your kids life's over but the government records your
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:46.480]  child's genitals UK headlines say it violates child porn laws same thing
[1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:54.000]  here they don't care it's like animal farm where you know two legs good four
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:58.280]  legs bad at first the pigs say look at the humans you know two legs are bad
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:02.880]  four legs good then the pigs kick the humans out have a revolution move in
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:07.080]  and they start saying well two legs are good and so are four legs and then
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:12.520]  finally two legs good four legs bad and bad and the pigs walk around like
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:17.200]  humans and it's the same thing here it's like the illegal aliens are above the
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:20.200]  law and get to have DWI's and not get arrested or get in trouble but
[1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:25.400]  citizens do well the police get to break the law this is a sick joke going back
[1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:29.880]  to Gary fielder attorney-in-law who stood up against this sounds like you had
[1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:33.600]  some victory against them what do they do when you show up now well you know it
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:37.280]  is I don't think that anyone down there has seen the video and I certainly
[1:25:37.280 --> 1:25:42.040]  haven't advertised it at least you know to my friends in the profession I just
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:45.480]  sort of try to go underneath the radar if you will but the last time I was down
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:48.960]  there I think something that happened because the last time I was down there I
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:54.360]  mean the private security guard he came around the corner with that wand and he
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:59.280]  was saying yes sir and thank you sir and this will just take a second sir and he
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:04.800]  wanted me in about 30 seconds and said have a nice day sir and he let me in he
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:10.280]  let me in the side door and I said well thank you and I just looked of course so
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:16.080]  I you know I I think that people are finally really in mass starting to wake
[1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:22.640]  up and they just had enough I just they just had enough and so it's it's it's
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:27.000]  changed a little bit but I'm not claiming victory because every time I do go
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.560]  down there as I exercise the option I just see person after person after person
[1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:37.360]  after person going through that scanner and it just makes me sad it just makes
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:43.800]  me sad because I think it's the you know they're they're trying to sort of get
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:47.360]  us used to all this so that when we go to the airport we don't think twice about
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:51.520]  it and that's real pressure when you want to get on the airplane you just feel
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:56.560]  like you have to comply and and I say no I'm not going through one ever under
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:00.200]  any circumstances in my life well what they're doing is they're setting the
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:04.560]  precedent in these special federal security zones now they admit they have
[1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:09.920]  Viper teams and TSA on the streets of Boston New York Houston Dallas Los
[1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:16.640]  Angeles wanting people people go to Mardi Gras folks go to New Year's Eve
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:20.960]  celebrations the police are randomly searching people we're being inducted
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:26.520]  into a police state worse than China well I've been practicing law since 1990 and
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:31.400]  I've witnessed it I saw it it happened in front of my eye and I'm very sad about
[1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:36.200]  it and I must say that when when it first happened and and you know what the
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:42.120]  guys from we are changing helping me we did some research 250,000 dollars for
[1:27:42.120 --> 1:27:47.560]  that instrument we did some research with regard to incidents in
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:51.960]  courthouses of the only incidents we could find in any courthouses in
[1:27:51.960 --> 1:27:56.240]  Colorado over the last 20 years was one judge chasing another judge to the
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.080]  parking lot with a shotgun and an officer who had gotten the gun people
[1:28:01.080 --> 1:28:04.160]  don't bring guns to court people don't bring knives to court people go to court
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:07.800]  to conduct business and that's what they're there for and of course they'll
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:13.240]  have that one story of a bendal a cocaine being found on you know a lawyer
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:17.200]  who had a hard weekend but that's not what it's set up for well mr. Fielder
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:22.240]  it's more than that I mean to take France they said they had 154 cases of
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:25.960]  husbands and wives killing each other so now if you yell at your wife or
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:30.520]  husband you're arrested they're using it you know one time somebody shoots
[1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:34.640]  somebody so no more second amendment one time somebody beats somebody over the
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:38.040]  head with a baseball bat so you gotta have a license for a baseball bat they
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:43.520]  are using this to turn us all into prisoners and it doesn't make us a
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:49.680]  safer society it is the hunger of this growing criminal government to literally
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:53.160]  turn everything into a prison look at the public schools our children are being
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:29:00.120]  trained to be prisoners well my like I said I live it I see it I put up put up
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:04.160]  with it to some degree I've had the spenders put on all my pants because I
[1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:10.120]  got sick of taking my belt off every single day or five times a day I just
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:14.040]  think that that's any I just think that's a degradation I think as a human
[1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:19.520]  being I ought to be allowed to pinch my pants up with a leather belt and and
[1:29:19.520 --> 1:29:23.600]  walk through a metal detector and be able to conduct business without having
[1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:32.320]  to disrobe be touched be delayed and just just that and to have access to the
[1:29:32.320 --> 1:29:35.440]  courts and it's only getting worse to the court and an airplane or shopping
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:39.840]  ball wherever I want to stay there we're gonna come right back and discuss how we
[1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.720]  need to set the president in Colorado and the few other states that are
[1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:46.600]  putting these in to stop it before it's on every street corner which they're
[1:29:46.600 --> 1:29:52.520]  now setting up in England we'll be right back stay with us we're on the march the

[1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:37.160]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:40.680]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:45.920]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:51.920]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:57.440]  info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison
[1:32:57.440 --> 1:33:00.440]  planet dot TV

[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:24.280]  tour right now and we really appreciate him joining us today and fighting back
[1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:30.000]  against tyranny again why did one guy stand up and change the policy where
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:35.400]  they don't record minors by pointing out it was illegal which it is why did one
[1:33:35.400 --> 1:33:39.720]  guy make it where they just want you I mean obviously you can tell if somebody's
[1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:44.600]  got a gun to keep the precious little judges safe maybe once a year somebody
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:48.920]  gets into a courtroom and blows away a judge and there's tens of thousands of
[1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:53.760]  court hearings going on conservatively more than that there's what it's there's
[1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:59.000]  over 10,000 counties in the US and every county's having dozens and dozens of
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:03.400]  hearings every day and that's just county court state court federal court all
[1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:09.880]  these other new kangaroo administrative law courts they've created and they say
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:14.240]  they want naked body scanners everywhere but remember as I told you 14 years ago
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:18.680]  went over the documents they take your baby's blood at birth and keep it in a
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:23.720]  UN database now it's mainstream news but CNN goes yes it is for research but
[1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:29.840]  it may save lives obviously when they say it's a mandated state health
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:33.760]  department not a law but mandated I mean I've had three children and I've sat
[1:34:33.760 --> 1:34:36.960]  there and said no you can't take their blood the nurse gets mad and goes it's
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:45.020]  the law and I go no it isn't the law lady I have to know what it is and they
[1:34:45.020 --> 1:34:48.960]  just push us and push us and push us and push us it's the same thing they're
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.720]  recording your body the government admits it radiates you it's equivalent of an
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:58.000]  x-ray not as bad as a chest x-ray but close and now they want actual x-rayers
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:03.840]  there's no end to them domesticating you squatting on you spitting in your
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:10.840]  face they had Super Bowl lads that are coming up by Audi I will never buy an
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:18.680]  Audi I will I will boycott Audi selling eco cops arresting people for taking hot
[1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:22.360]  baths now you think that's a joke they're training school kids to write
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:25.360]  fake tickets to their parents and saying it will be arrestable and they
[1:35:25.360 --> 1:35:28.480]  arrest somebody from throwing a battery away in the trash most states already
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.960]  have laws wherever you accidentally do that you go to prison they mean business
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:37.960]  folks and that's to acclimate you this is all dog training this is what they're
[1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:42.600]  doing now going back to our guest who I really appreciate joining us is there
[1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:47.120]  any websites Gary we can visit are there any places we can find out more I guess
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:51.680]  we are changed Colorado's got the videos up other points you'd like to make
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:55.360]  about this as you said we've got a lot of airline executives coming out and
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:58.640]  saying they're against this but we've got to press them to say no we've got some
[1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:02.760]  major airports saying no it comes out with clear evidence the underwear
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:06.680]  bombing was staged that's coming up next hour with a former embassy head who
[1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:11.680]  exposed all this other points you'd like to make sir well just a couple of the
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:19.600]  website is gig is up net and that just has basic information about situation and
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:24.040]  a little bit of information about the speaking engagements that I've been
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:29.560]  asked to to conduct but I think the big thing is for everyone to really
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:34.000]  understand their rights really do the research do the reading and be very
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:37.680]  professional I know that these police officers are just doing their job but
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:43.320]  when you get pulled over when you get in a situation follow the lead of the
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:47.320]  peaceful crowd who are standing up for their rights in the most professional
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:51.960]  way use the word sir look them in the eye don't let them pull any of their
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:58.120]  tactics with with body position the tone of their voice how they stand straight
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.600]  on you square your shoulders right up look them right in the eye and say no
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:08.720]  sir I'd rather not I just don't think that the and you should add if they're
[1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:13.440]  being rude hey you're a public servant I've treated you with respect you treat
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:17.600]  me with respect that's the word you have to use over and over I'm one of the
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:21.720]  people I pay your salary and I would really appreciate it if you would
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.640]  continue to treat me with the same level of respect that I'm treating you
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:29.840]  yeah this is this groveling to the government has almost encouraged them
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:34.680]  like it's the natural order of things the only real possession we've got is our
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:38.720]  liberties our freedoms and property rights and it's all under assault it's
[1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:43.440]  all being dismantled folks and there's no interest involved to that the the
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:49.080]  public side has no recognition at least they're pretending not to recognize how
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:53.840]  much pressure they're putting on the private side and the private side is
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:57.960]  squealing but the public side just keeps marching along they get paid every month
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:38:02.840]  pensions are funded their health care is funded their checks are being cashed
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:07.320]  right away it's just like lung cancer not listening it thinks it's winning it's
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:12.280]  growing it's got plenty of blood shut the hell up I'm doing what I want and and
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:18.280]  and I think in the end the self-interest is knowing that if they don't support
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:21.240]  the system somehow they're not going to be able to take advantage of that
[1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:25.840]  retirement program five years away or ten years away or one year away they're
[1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.000]  gonna do what Venezuela and everybody else have done they're gonna cut all the
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:33.040]  cops funding as well and and and the judges and all these people that enforce
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:38.360]  we know how this is done we know that they're already making California
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:42.600]  government people work a day a week free because the government the only thing
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:47.760]  growing is the government the only thing growing is the government and so they're
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:54.120]  at their feet the regular the regular public servant is as scared as I am
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:59.000]  they're as scared as you are so they're acting out of self-interest to try to keep
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.840]  the system proper that's right the more corrupt they get the more heat they get
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:05.920]  and they go we got to get even rougher on them to get them in line make them
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:09.960]  submit we've got to through the threat continuum get control of the situation
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:14.760]  you don't have control of the situation foreign banks are using you to carry out
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:19.080]  their robbery it's like a ratchet it goes one direction they only know one
[1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:25.840]  language turn it up turn it up turn it up turn it up more years in prison more
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:30.400]  tickets I've never seen so many police officers on the street with radar gun
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:34.080]  and pulling people over for no registration no proof of insurance
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:38.160]  driving right down the street go on the speed limit right down the lane no
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:43.760]  drinking nothing on board now you I've never seen now they're passing cell phone
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:48.600]  laws as an excuse let me bring this up to you I've confirmed it's been in the
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:54.160]  news that a sheriff will arrest a van full of 14 illegals in one case he brings
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:57.840]  them to ice they say we're not gonna pick them up even if they do this was in
[1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:02.200]  associated press the feds come and give them green cards and jobs working for
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:05.640]  the feds I mean the feds want all these foreigners working for them this is like
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:10.200]  their their foreign army here in Austin three years ago I pulled up to the
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:18.520]  office at night and one of my it was a contractor TIT guy was in handcuffs and I
[1:40:18.520 --> 1:40:21.920]  walk over in the cops bow up and freak out they go it's Alex Jones hey Alex I'm
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:25.320]  a fan of the show a black cop white cop and I'm going okay you're fan of the
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:30.000]  show why are you arresting him well his license is expired we saw him turn in
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.360]  here it looks suspicious I don't know we've got an internet problem I I called
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  him to get him up here I'm having to pay him a lot of money to be here at nine
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:44.040]  o'clock at night and you know well in area right here and then the cops starts
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:48.120]  going I don't care I'm out of here in six months I got this great band and I go
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:51.040]  you were playing in New York I go where the cops rude to me goes yeah I asked a
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:56.600]  cop for directions he screamed at me and said do I look like a telephone book and
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.320]  he said and I explained to him I was a cop and then he apologized those things
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.840]  it's only okay because you're another fellow God and then and as they took him
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:08.080]  away to jail they they admitted they said yeah if he was an illegal we're
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:11.400]  told that we don't even give him fines so they're just let go we get in trouble
[1:41:11.400 --> 1:41:17.060]  and I've seen that in the news and then last night I was I'm not gonna say
[1:41:17.060 --> 1:41:23.160]  county or city I was talking to a clerk with the courts and they told me what I've
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:27.600]  already seen in the news and we're an amnesty sanctuary city 800 plus cities
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:35.800]  are Denver is as well and they said 60 plus percent of the arrest in Austin for
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:41.800]  crime is the illegals and that's even when they catch them or 60 with the
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:46.520]  actual quote was 65% of crime as illegals and they are literally above the
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:56.320]  law but then the citizens literally five ten thousand dollars year in jail five
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:01.240]  years probation if you've had two beers don't have a driver's license you're
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:07.400]  arrested fees fines I mean car towed if you don't have proper insurance or
[1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:11.080]  registration yes oh and then you never get it back you never get it back so my
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:15.320]  question is I mean so my question is to you are you seeing that in Denver I mean
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:19.800]  and and what are the legal ramifications of this level of discrimination
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:27.600]  well Denver auctioned off seventy five hundred vehicles just last year 2009
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:34.240]  that's approximately 70 a day people are losing their cars to parking tickets or
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:37.840]  you know we're gonna know registration or whatever it may be and I thought it
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:42.120]  was just exclusive to Denver because I've you were at the DNC you saw what's
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:47.720]  happening here but I've been talking to people in my hometown in Alaska it's
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:51.920]  happening there it's happening in Maine it's happening in Washington Oregon
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:59.240]  Texas it's happening everywhere and it's it's it's so far out of control that the
[1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:06.360]  only way to do it is to either submit which is unfortunate get a driver's
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:09.240]  license make sure everything's in line make sure your crack windshield fixed
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:13.760]  immediately or fight back and so I'm I'm just sort of choosing a middle path of
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:19.360]  sovereignty I'm being very careful in the battles that I choose but ultimately
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:22.200]  I'll give you a good example there's a young man here that we're gonna follow
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:27.640]  a federal lawsuit he got it he was coming home from a from a 9-11
[1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:32.720]  architects and engineers conference I hadn't had a drop to drink but they saw
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:39.920]  the bumper stickers and and he was very nice they racked him up on DUI of the
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:44.880]  running a red light failed his signal we went to a jury trial in one in the
[1:43:44.880 --> 1:43:52.040]  meantime they had auctioned off his car and you know in the end one of the
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:56.840]  remedies in federal court well worse than that for your right to actually stand up
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:01.120]  and say hey I'm taking the city and county on I'm gonna you got a file
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:05.600]  lawsuit what other way are you gonna be able to stand up for your right to try
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:09.880]  to bring this to some sort of reasonable conclusion well worse than that I remember
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:15.360]  articles out of New Jersey in DC one was actually USA Today in fact Google this
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:22.880]  or smart page it or you know any search engine this police caught stealing cars
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:28.520]  in DC and in uniform they pull up to McDonald's parking lot in a local TV
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:32.080]  investigation hook up to a nice car and just steal it in the cops openly run
[1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:39.080]  shop shops so we're getting very close to purely open 100% criminal government
[1:44:39.080 --> 1:44:44.840]  where they pull over the woman single mother to three kids she's working two
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:50.920]  jobs and they give her a bunch of fines she can't afford the insurance anymore
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:56.280]  she's paying for the illegal aliens in the city they they they impound her car
[1:44:56.280 --> 1:45:00.120]  she can't pay the thousand dollars to get it out they sell it now she's
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:04.760]  completely destitute now CPS comes and takes her kids or she's on welfare the
[1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:09.680]  way they want I mean they are literally hunting us and as the economy implodes
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:14.920]  and falls apart they're just cops every mile and they literally the illegals are
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:18.600]  gods they I mean I mean I mean I mean I know you're a sanctuary city are they
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:22.120]  just I mean are people noticing the discrimination where they are just
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:26.880]  completely left alone and allowed to rob and steal and and do whatever they want
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.160]  there's no money to be made off them that's just the bottom line there's no
[1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:33.200]  other way to say it there's no money to be made the only money to be made is off
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:38.240]  the citizen who's got a job and and who actually show up and actually pay the
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:45.120]  fine what about citizens starting to drive cars and then going in court
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:50.520]  watching for the illegals that can they literally in Austin $1 fine oh you DWI
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:56.800]  you ran into the car $1 fine and then show the citizens getting $5,000
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:02.800]  fines and then getting that citizen to sue I mean that's got to violate a bunch
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:06.720]  of laws discrimination racketeering I mean what is the selective enforcement
[1:46:06.720 --> 1:46:10.720]  unjust weights and measures I mean what are the cases on that counselor well
[1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:15.400]  I'm not you know aware of of anybody that that can take the system on because
[1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:21.680]  I've I've anyone who's ever gone to federal court with a client who's got
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:27.160]  black eyes broken legs I mean you can have a client pretty well beat up and to
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:31.860]  actually succeed with the 1983 action it's going to take two years of
[1:46:31.860 --> 1:46:37.160]  litigation about 30 or $40,000 in cost and even then you'll be lucky to settle
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:41.880]  that case much less get a jury verdict they fight these two thin nails they get
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:46.000]  the big downtown lawyers to come in and of course you know the paternal order of
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:52.360]  police are all over in case this top because this is the racket I mean
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:57.240]  they've got the environmental laws the property tax the CPS and the public are
[1:46:57.240 --> 1:47:00.800]  literally like cows they bring into slaughterhouses and they're not going
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:04.600]  to let cows on their field revolt they're gonna walk up to that cow with a
[1:47:04.600 --> 1:47:11.640]  with a with a piece of PVC pipe or with a stun gun with a cattle prod and let us
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:16.440]  know hey this in America you're our slave now well you got you got two
[1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:20.240]  rights left you got a right to an attorney and I know that's tough but
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:23.320]  you've also got a right to a jury trial and those are basically your only two
[1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:27.240]  left and so when you get in the pinch you gotta you gotta exercise those two
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:33.000]  right I will say this the gentleman who had gotten the DUI because he was part
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.200]  of the Colorado we are changed of course they videotape everything so we had him
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:41.440]  on videotape no slurred speech no bloodshot watery eyes you know he hadn't
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:46.760]  dropped a drink and so we make a joke here in Denver we got to play 911 truth
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:50.480]  videos in front of the jury and they found him not guilty in about 30 minutes
[1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:55.040]  so you know all the all the jurors are shaking their head up and down you know
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:48:01.000]  so it's a cop didn't get in trouble I bet those cops are being promoted right
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.720]  now to the top not even a it was just another case it was just another day it
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:12.520]  was just another verdict I feel for these young prosecutors I don't feel like
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:16.400]  they know what they're doing they think they're doing their job they get up in
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:22.560]  court and say we represent the people I'm Jim Smith for the people I almost
[1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:27.680]  laugh out loud every morning when I hear that these these district attorneys
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:30.960]  with all due respect I'm a lawyer I can't badmouth other other professionals
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:35.520]  but they no more represent the people and the man on the move well here's the
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:39.840]  issue I have great police send me documents videos material so you got the
[1:48:39.840 --> 1:48:43.640]  good cops who are doing it by the book and then now they're being hounded out
[1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:48.240]  everywhere by just I won't even go down downtown Austin anymore because it's
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:53.120]  like shaved head Royd head crazy cops and I'm like man these guys look like
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.200]  they should be in the pen but instead they're here and they look at you like
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:02.920]  you are a rabbit and they are a wolf I don't understand why mayors are standing
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:05.920]  up I don't understand why sheriff's are standing up this is not good for commerce
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.080]  commerce depends upon a free flow it depends upon good energy depends upon
[1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:17.080]  people the globalist the head of NASA the head of the UN program they've all
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:20.480]  said they want the end of the industrialized society the banks have
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:24.760]  printed up more money counselor than there is real items they don't want us
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:28.640]  they don't want commerce anymore do you understand that's they're only using
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:34.760]  commerce to destroy what's left well I started waking up about five years ago
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:39.320]  and I thought it I thought it hard mentally for two of the years and I
[1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:44.640]  don't think anyone who's got five senses can deny their own reality now I
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:51.480]  cannot I don't know anyone who's even the least bit educated that can deny that
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:57.200]  everything you've said has come to pass as harsh as it is that it's hard to
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:02.200]  believe it is I remember dr. Paul Craig Roberts saying in ten years will be a
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:08.720]  third-world nation I laughed out loud I don't laugh anymore well the Germans
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:13.400]  couldn't believe it would happen the Russians folks this is the norm the norm

[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:47.520]  State Department they said no was part of a secret program bringing him into the

[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:18.640]  we're going to break here in a few minutes long segment coming up recap
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:23.600]  exactly what happened with some of the 9-11 hijackers that you tried to block
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:29.840]  from getting into the country and what's currently happening today with the
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:35.000]  underwear bomber we'll discuss that okay speaking I didn't have problems with
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:41.920]  the the folks who were part of the 9-11 attack I have been in Jeddah between
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:49.120]  1987 and 1989 at the CIA's consulate where I had people I would routinely
[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:54.080]  reject for a visa to come to the United States because they could not prove they
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.720]  had any ties either to Saudi Arabia or their own country that were sufficiently
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:02.800]  strong to compel them to return once they had been to the United States and
[2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:07.160]  then done whatever they were supposed to do in most instances they could not
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:09.880]  tell me what they were going to do in the United States or where they were
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:16.240]  going they didn't have any substantive jobs they tended to be clerks people who
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:22.960]  worked in supermarkets as checkers and things like this and I kept rejecting
[2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:27.160]  them and the consul general who worked for the central intelligence agency and
[2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:33.440]  the Paul Arvitt debate who was a CIA case officer assigned at the commercial
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:41.760]  section and the guy who Andy Weber who worked in the consular section part time
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:45.960]  also worked for the agency and they kept saying these people need to go to the
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:50.280]  United States we need to give them visas and could not or would not tell me why
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:56.080]  I routinely rejected them and I was told if you want to keep your job you will
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.880]  give them a visa it wasn't until I was out of the foreign service that I learned
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:05.320]  Joe Trento and a couple of other people that what was really going on was these
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:09.600]  people were being recruited for the Afghan war against the Soviets and they
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:13.160]  were being brought to the United States for training out were for rewards or for
[2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:17.640]  debriefings or whatever and they went back to Afghanistan skilled and how to
[2:04:17.640 --> 2:04:23.160]  blow things up and shoot things down I think after some reflection and looking
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:26.520]  at the news over the last couple of years that these people formed the cadre
[2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:33.240]  of organizations and groups to destabilize any government the United
[2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:36.880]  States did particularly like they I think they're working in Iraq this is an
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:42.080]  Islamist terror brigade but but to be specific this is in the lead up in the
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:47.280]  in the few years right before 9-11 and we and we and I've seen the news reports
[2:04:47.280 --> 2:04:52.280]  even the Wall Street Journal in the late 90s of these sprawling terror training
[2:04:52.280 --> 2:04:56.120]  camps where they're training these people and then they end up attacking a
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:04:59.120]  stay there we'll be right back

[2:08:02.200 --> 2:08:10.800]  political talk alex jones on the GCN radio network okay to flesh all this
[2:08:10.800 --> 2:08:19.240]  out he was the head of the visa section of the jettison of arabia and u.s.
[2:08:19.240 --> 2:08:24.800]  embassy he discovered after he got out of the foreign service that they were
[2:08:24.800 --> 2:08:28.320]  creating kind of this islamic brigade to attack of destabilizing country they
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:35.000]  wanted that's his words then it was the same jettison of arabia embassy that gave
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:40.640]  the passports or the visas excuse me to the 15 suppose at 9-11 hijackers down
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:46.320]  your own words mr. springman walk through this and why it's so important when I
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:53.040]  was there in jeta between 1987 and 1989 there was this constant flow of people
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:56.960]  who wanted visas and could not explain why they were going to the united states
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:01.560]  and could not explain what was going to compel them to return to jeta or their
[2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:05.480]  own country when they were done and I routinely blocked them and I was
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:12.120]  pressured and pressured and pressured and I raised how I filed freedom of
[2:09:12.120 --> 2:09:15.720]  information act request I complained to the Bureau of consular affairs in
[2:09:15.720 --> 2:09:21.440]  Washington I complained to the embassy in riyadh and basically was ignored then
[2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:29.200]  when I saw that the 15 to the 19 alleged attackers flying airplanes into
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:32.840]  buildings the united states had gotten their visas from jeta which I think was
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:38.360]  reported in the Los Angeles Times I started to raise hell again I went to
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:42.120]  the FBI and said I know what was going on this is how it was happening this was
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:47.440]  the CIA operation of some 20 Americans only three that I knew of including
[2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:51.520]  myself worked for the Department of State the rest worked for the CIA or the
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:59.120]  NSA the national security agency and it just went into a black hole I talked to
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:03.480]  a career consular officer with a lot more time in the system than I had and
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:07.920]  he told me that the CIA had done this before and it looked like the Indians
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:11.920]  were back off the reservation and he had thought that the people of state had
[2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:19.440]  rained them in and put them back on obviously not the amazing thing was
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:25.960]  that this went on and went on and went on I haven't told by Selena Castillo a
[2:10:25.960 --> 2:10:31.840]  former drug enforcement agency official that it was routine for the CIA to put
[2:10:31.840 --> 2:10:40.440]  its people into a stack of applications for visas handed by travel agencies
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:44.200]  which is what happened in jeta they had changed to something called the visa
[2:10:44.200 --> 2:10:48.680]  express program where the travel agencies would handle the paperwork for visa
[2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:53.040]  issuance and what they would be rubber stamped by the consular officer at at
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:11:02.760]  jeta and I was just absolutely flabbergasted at this and the CIA
[2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:07.880]  simply ran the whole show I had made a mistake in not keeping copies of all the
[2:11:07.880 --> 2:11:14.240]  pieces I had denied I had a folder with me and had left it there in jeta and I
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:18.840]  learned later that it had been destroyed by person or persons unknown I could
[2:11:18.840 --> 2:11:22.720]  never find out who did this journalists have asked me repeatedly well you know
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:26.240]  who were these people we'd love to see those applications and I'd say sorry I
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:30.760]  can't do it and I never didn't know where they went once they went to the
[2:11:30.760 --> 2:11:34.520]  United States that's something I've not been able to find out either well let's
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:40.840]  get down to brass tax here they use these muslim brigades train bar government
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:45.880]  rosinski's now written two books saying that they created these groups al-qaeda
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:51.000]  was the computer program a name at the CIA and state department that they
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  actually attacked the russian puppets in afghanistan to get the russians to come
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:00.760]  in that's now admitted history it wasn't like we see in these you know movies
[2:12:00.760 --> 2:12:05.920]  about charlie wilson's war where the u.s. got involved in 1983 you know it was
[2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:11.800]  1979 and so all of this is going on they then use the muslim extremists to
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:16.480]  menace iraq saddam gave speeches about how they work for the u.s. I'm not saying
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:20.600]  Saddam was a good guy they're now using the same wahhabi is to attack Iran
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:26.360]  bush in 2007 put out of the White House directive admitting they were using four
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:30.920]  different groups three of wahhabi is one of them curd against the iranian so
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:36.040]  that's on record they use some of these groups in out of albania against
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:39.840]  kosovo and the serbs and then they let them into the u.s. to use them against
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:43.840]  their number one enemy the american people the offshore military industrial
[2:12:43.840 --> 2:12:48.280]  complex wants to put naked body scanners in and have the patriot act and we get
[2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:53.960]  the internal homeland security and we get the internal my act reports saying
[2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:58.160]  homeland security in north com are really for gun owning conservatives
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:04.640]  libertarians and anti-war activists just anybody and so this whole now now
[2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:10.280]  again i'm not saying that i'm not asking you specifically what you think about
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:14.000]  the statement i said that's clearly what this is i mean these guys are a foreign
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:19.200]  brigade kind of like the islamicist foreign legion that works for the big
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:24.120]  banks and they and they were let in and whatever happened they were involved
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:27.680]  and we were attacked and then i get the secret homeland security documents in
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:32.440]  day one it's all about the american people and i have the boston globe
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:35.960]  ridge accused bush white house of political use of terror alert system i
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:39.920]  mean mister springman but i know you're just technically telling the facts but
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:41.440]  what does this look like to you
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:46.320]  well it looks like either a crew or a planned crew and it's basically it's a
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:51.200]  march towards dictatorship and a uh... national security state
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:54.880]  the uh... the government really needs to create a uh... climate of fear in
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:59.240]  washington and throughout the country info my friends tell me educated
[2:13:59.240 --> 2:14:00.760]  travel friends
[2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:04.360]  uh... it's exceeding they want to be secure they want to be faith
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:08.200]  uh... they don't want to fly to foreign countries because who knows what will
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:09.720]  happen there
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:13.440]  and it's absolutely astonishing to me
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:18.560]  oh my god so again in your own words police fleshed this out as you know
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:22.800]  uh... a uh... you're well respected twenty years state department high level
[2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:27.720]  you basically were concurring you've got this foreign brigade the cia created
[2:14:27.720 --> 2:14:30.880]  they've they've they bring them in here and they attack us even according to
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:32.320]  their official story
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:35.320]  uh... you've got uh...
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:37.920]  colonel steven butler head of monorail
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:41.800]  uh... defense language saying i don't know what happened on nine eleven
[2:14:41.800 --> 2:14:46.120]  but mohammed and others were in my school year before something
[2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:48.000]  is going on
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:49.960]  and and we have
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:53.640]  uh... i mean it's right there in front of us
[2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:56.040]  they brought these guys in
[2:14:56.040 --> 2:14:59.600]  to attack us or be the decoys of the dummies or whatever happened we know
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:02.080]  they brought him in we know they protected him and we know they're
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:04.760]  using it to take our rights i mean bottom line inside job
[2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:08.080]  you know it's a you know it's it's much like i said the canadian
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:11.680]  broadcasting corporation when i was interviewed uh... must be nine years ago
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:12.520]  now
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:16.240]  uh... that you know it he looked to me like it this was done deliberately all
[2:15:16.240 --> 2:15:21.280]  across was three thousand odd lives in new york city in the end in washington
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:24.520]  and what would they get out of it they get a war against all of the arabs and
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:27.960]  muslims in the world they get american bases around the world that i mean they
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:32.800]  did that the american bases today standing close to a thousand
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:36.840]  there are american soldiers and uh... i i can't every country the world but an
[2:15:36.840 --> 2:15:39.080]  awful lot of them
[2:15:39.080 --> 2:15:42.040]  they're out there and they're antagonizing the locals with their
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:45.840]  presence with their actions uh... like in okinawa they're continually raping
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:48.440]  uh... women and then they're picking fights
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:51.160]  uh... so it's uh...
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:55.440]  we're our own worst enemy but they want this they want wars because wars uh...
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:15:58.840]  are very good at creating uh...
[2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:02.240]  markets for weapons and bombs and things that are used up it isn't something
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:04.960]  that you buy a car and you sell a car
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:08.400]  uh... and you make this you make that you know you can only have so many
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:12.000]  washing machines but you can drop an infinite number of bombs because you're
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.960]  continually making them in factories
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:19.120]  and tax the american people to pay for it all exactly so

[2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:51.280]  is uh... i mean how obvious does this get
[2:17:51.280 --> 2:17:54.520]  i think it's like richard read the shoe bomber i mean he's not well for playing
[2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:57.720]  but he doesn't do it in the washroom he said tries to set fire to issue in the

[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:03.680]  i think you know people don't question that they think that whatever the government

[2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:28.440]  real second party but we have a democrat the republicans united in uh...
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:29.840]  forcing uh...

[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:01.400]  it was hard for me
[2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:05.440]  to read the rand corporation in pentagon white papers and see the pentagon
[2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:09.160]  saying here's been laudan he's about to get you when he attacks you
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:13.440]  america's gonna change and i saw this in the six months before nine eleven i said
[2:19:13.440 --> 2:19:16.960]  they're probably about the stage and attack using the c i s at the lot which
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:18.360]  was admitted c i a
[2:19:18.360 --> 2:19:20.920]  they're probably gonna attack the world trade center because the feds cook the
[2:19:20.920 --> 2:19:22.600]  bomb train the driver
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:27.120]  that they told a mod salon the security agent from egypt that they were setting

[2:19:29.400 --> 2:19:32.800]  he intelligently knew they were setting him up recorded them that was in the
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:34.240]  new york times so i knew
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:38.560]  they were getting ready for this so it wasn't easy for me to go on air
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:41.920]  before nine eleven and say they're gonna do it and in the day of it but

[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:38.840]  and some other questions but sir i remember seeing an la times article and another washington post
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:45.560]  article this is actually covered in my film road to tyranny where it's not just islamist
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:50.440]  instead of saudi arabia or afghanistan they're using against all these different countries
[2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:56.840]  including us but that the pentagon and other private corporate networks the israelis and others
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:01.800]  the british and we know the british have been caught as well the israelis admit they created
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:07.080]  quote fake al-qaeda groups that's that's jerusalem post every time it was about to be a peace deal
[2:25:07.080 --> 2:25:14.600]  but 3400 and another 1500 or so under clinton but the first 3000 under bush they brought iraqi
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:19.560]  republican a guardian and then they were involved and i've interviewed the local police it was on
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:27.960]  the local news with mcvay on the oklahoma city bombing i mean now talking to former colleagues
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:34.040]  and others do we have any idea how many of these terrorists they brought in not really i've been
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:41.080]  asked that a couple of times and the best that i could uh estimate during the year and a half or
[2:25:41.080 --> 2:25:48.680]  so i was in jeta was there were maybe a couple of hundred people that um whose visa applications i
[2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:55.880]  challenged and who i rejected during the uh the required interview uh in actual fact as joe
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:26:01.800]  trendo the journalist uh asked me he said well what happens if somebody comes to you with a clean
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:06.600]  passport and a believable cover story would you issue the visa and i said yes and there was one
[2:26:06.600 --> 2:26:12.120]  instance where the cia base chief erik welkin bush who's retired now and living in finley ohio
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:19.000]  uh he came to me and said mike wink wink i've got a guy for you wink wink nudge nudge um he's been
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:24.520]  to the states before he's one of our people uh we want to bring him over and we want to talk to him
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:29.960]  in washington uh you know he's going to come to you make it look good well the guy who was an iranian
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:38.840]  who ran a rug shop uh and he'd been to the states had visas uh it was going to uh check on his network
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:43.800]  of both outlets in the united states and and deal with shipping issues and sales and things like that
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:50.200]  and uh i issued the visa uh and i said well geez you know why did this guy have to come to me
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:56.680]  and say you know we want you to issue this uh when the guy he had a perfectly legitimate reason
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:27:01.240]  for going to the united states and had been there before and then had a legitimate uh business going
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:07.160]  on in in saudi arabia uh and i thought well you know geez you know what's the story of these people
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:13.480]  uh all these people i rejected if they had come to me beforehand like they did with the iranian guy
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:19.960]  and said mike we we we're doing this thing in the states we want you to um to take care of these guys
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:23.640]  and they'd given me some hints as to what was going on i was dumb enough at the time to have
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:29.160]  issued the visas without question uh there was a political officer who really worked for the cia
[2:27:29.160 --> 2:27:36.440]  as the case officer in the clandestine service karen sazara uh he he wanted me to issue a visa to a
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:44.040]  samali guy and he had no reason for going to the united states he was a refugee in saudi arabia he
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:49.880]  was unemployed in saudi arabia and i kept rejecting the guy so she went to the chief of the visa
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:55.000]  section and said uh you know i want this guy and the guy gave him the visa and what i asked
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:00.440]  just to steven's about this who is the chief of the section and who might wonder about he said oh
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:06.280]  well it was national security reasons we had to give him the visa well again we see this repeated
[2:28:06.280 --> 2:28:13.720]  like roundhog day over and over again the father of the underwear bomber others specifically saying
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:18.200]  he's at training camps he's probably gonna attack don't let him in and then they said oh we just
[2:28:18.200 --> 2:28:24.600]  screwed up and then it turned out they ordered him to be allowed to fly here and and and who
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:29.800]  can be smart dressed and get someone through security without a passport you can't do it i
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:35.000]  was in germany uh and i had a diplomatic passport and my daughter came to visit i wanted to go
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:41.960]  past security and take her to the airplane and they wouldn't let me so this is the you know this
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:50.520]  the fix was in on this thing why are they doing it i mean you talk about empire i mean break it down
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:57.000]  for people well you need to create fear you know americans as barry's wicker the canadian journalist
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.560]  and enwood's the other canadian journalist have have written that americans don't believe the
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:06.600]  government were alive of them americans don't believe that their government would engage in
[2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:13.480]  terrorist activities either at home or abroad and yet you look at this uh and somebody like
[2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:18.120]  opia sudiki the pakistani woman the mother of three small children who had been educated in
[2:29:18.120 --> 2:29:23.400]  the hard sciences in the united states uh she somehow was kidnapped on the way to the airport
[2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:29.720]  in pakistan pulled off to an american camp somewhere and she the opportunity of trying to get loose
[2:29:29.720 --> 2:29:35.160]  and somehow manage to shoot a couple of americans nobody seems to know how and she's dragged to the
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:43.480]  united states and convicted of uh shooting american soldiers in afghanistan and when i had sent a uh
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:48.520]  an email to her a couple of years ago asking her to give herself up to the fbi who were looking for

[2:29:52.760 --> 2:30:02.600]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones with five good reasons
[2:30:02.600 --> 2:30:07.800]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:30:07.800 --> 2:30:12.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[2:30:12.760 --> 2:30:18.040]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[2:30:18.040 --> 2:30:23.160]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:28.600]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:33.800]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:30:33.800 --> 2:30:38.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:42.920]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:47.640]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:47.320]  esquire the former chief of the visa section in jettus audio rabia an attorney with 20 years
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:53.800]  in the u.s. foreign service continuing here sir you were trying to tell the story of this particular
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:34:00.520]  lady the contact yes go ahead she was in pakistan as i mentioned before the break that you know she
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:06.920]  had been abducted in pakistan and put into american camps or a series of camps and then
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:14.280]  ended up being tried in new york for shooting americans in afghanistan you know they they
[2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.160]  didn't convict her of being the al-qaeda gun wall that they claimed she was the fbi was on tv in
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:24.360]  the washington area for hour after hour on this uh randy and raving but now she's public enemy
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:30.040]  number one and without explaining how it was she could do all these things uh with three small
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:37.960]  children under the age of five uh but the thing was when i had sent an email to her uh saying that
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:43.240]  the fbi wanted to talk to her and she should give herself up uh the next thing i knew my email
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:49.880]  accounts were seized under the sneak and peek provision of the ill-named patriot act and uh i
[2:34:49.880 --> 2:34:56.200]  could not uh access any of my emails i could not send and receive emails and the government was
[2:34:56.200 --> 2:35:01.480]  reading the emails i ate that were in my personal account and in the office account uh violating
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:07.960]  attorney client privilege but all because you wanted to find out how some woman broke out of
[2:35:07.960 --> 2:35:12.680]  a torture facility and kills a bunch of people obviously they just whacked some folks who wanted
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:18.200]  to get rid of because she's got all these little kids but she now suddenly is is as deadly as the
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:23.800]  sum of bin laden that's right i mean that it was amazing they they they harassed her family they
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:27.640]  bang on their doors at ten o'clock at night they tried to break down the doors where they were
[2:35:27.640 --> 2:35:33.480]  staying in the united states uh it was absolutely amazing what these people got away with well let's
[2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:39.480]  talk about civil edmunds um she was able to as you know get into court so she could break her gag
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:43.720]  order she went and told the congressional commission the nine eleven commission bush appointed
[2:35:44.280 --> 2:35:48.600]  all these things in secret she's now been able to say them publicly she for those that don't know
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:55.800]  was an fbi translator taking nsa intercepts and she said it was child kidnapping sex trafficking
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:06.120]  guns drugs weapons al-qaeda working for the cia up till the day of nine eleven in coordination
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:14.040]  i mean this is now in court that that i mean it's incredible i mean al-qaeda is a islamist
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:20.040]  brigade that works for i want you to comment on civil levins and then talk about who is this
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:25.000]  network from your research i mean is it one government or from my research u.s british
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:31.080]  israelis together uh break it down okay um you know as best as i can i've met the bell a couple of
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:39.240]  times uh the uh the washington based journalist wane madson had talked about her reasons for uh
[2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:45.080]  raising hell with the fbi about what was going on in turkey and he said that she had uncovered a
[2:36:45.080 --> 2:36:54.520]  um israeli uh turkish u.s uh intelligence operation and sibel is extremely competent she's very
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:37:01.640]  capable she's very well educated and uh she was waited as a translator at the fbi uh but you know
[2:37:01.640 --> 2:37:06.120]  i can believe this i i really think that the the u.s and the british and the israelis are all
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:12.760]  in this together because uh i've been told uh by wane again the journalist i've read norm
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:19.080]  chomsky's stuff uh you know something like 10 percent of the israeli uh uh military force is
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:25.000]  in turkey and that apparently is a code word for being in northern iraq trying to separate uh the
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:31.080]  northern oil bearing region from the south and is what whatever they can do to weaken iraq uh
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:37.000]  they're happy to do it uh and the british they were caught a couple of times trying to destabilize
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:42.360]  iraq uh they were in fact arrested some of their soldiers were arrested from the special air service
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:49.640]  the uh uh the special operations branch of the the british armed forces uh with the bomb making
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:54.760]  equipment and the iraqis wanted to know what was going on and then the british sent a couple of
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:38:00.680]  tanks to break them out of jail so yeah i'm gonna be specific they were dressed up with fake turbines
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:06.680]  and and and beards running around shooting at police and others posing as islamic extremists
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:11.880]  and i had ray mcgovern high level cia for those that don't know advisor to ronald reagan and
[2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:15.880]  george bursh senior and he said day one when it happened and months later it came out he was right
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:23.160]  and he said from sources in iraq they blew up the golden mosque what in 2005 to get the
[2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:30.920]  shiites and sunnis killing each other i mean this is the british great game yeah of divide and
[2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:35.800]  conquer and then how many times at the finsbury mosque and these other mosques has it turned out
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:43.160]  that mi6 muslim operators are running the terror groups yeah i mean the in iraq for example the
[2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:50.600]  the muslims and the uh both branches of islam the shiites and the sunni uh and the christians all
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:56.120]  co-existed relatively peacefully and it wasn't until the american invasion and they were working
[2:38:56.120 --> 2:39:01.960]  together to resist the american occupation uh that suddenly there there began to be uh
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:07.960]  fights and explosions and assassinations amongst the various groups and then once you start them
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:12.920]  killing each other then it's real and this is a field in the court you keep going it's been better
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.880]  and now they're gonna play this game here to fully enslave the american people we have their
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:26.600]  internal documents what do we do about this well i tell you there isn't a whole lot to do unless you
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:32.520]  get people out in the street and demand a revolution and that's gonna be kind of hard because the
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:37.320]  government has the tanks and the atomic bombs and the people don't but you know the you keep
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:42.520]  you liking these idiots to congress who who lay down and happily accept whatever the government
[2:39:42.520 --> 2:39:48.120]  tells them to do and they support it they vote vote more money uh nancy polosi and harry reek
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:52.680]  keeps saying oh we don't want more is going on all around the world but they never stop and say
[2:39:52.680 --> 2:39:59.400]  no more money for blood well by the way when i get up here and i say that we interviewed steak knife
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:05.240]  who was later killed and all these other british special forces operatives who were commanding
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:12.280]  over 80 of the real ira carrying out bombings they would literally kneecap their underlings if
[2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:16.680]  they wouldn't go shoot police and bomb buildings that was used to stay in northern ireland for
[2:40:16.680 --> 2:40:20.840]  three decades that's now been in major british papers and then they killed a bunch of people that
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:26.120]  spoke out and this isn't a game we're talking about here uh we have the israelis in the jerusalem
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:35.320]  post in u p i in ap in 2003 uh we can pull these articles up right now uh israel created fake al-qaeda
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:41.880]  and then their excuses well we created hamas to counterbalance hezbollah and now we created fake
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:48.760]  al-qaeda groups who they then have bombed things as a pretext to continue the wars and the enslavement
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:56.520]  i mean this is not just us saying this this is a fact and that's why cast sunstein the white house
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:03.480]  regulations are has written all these white papers that are public now saying
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:09.480]  9 11 truth is our number one enemy we've got to infiltrate them arrest them shut them down
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:14.520]  we also see glenn beck saying it's the number one enemy claiming 9 11 truth wants to kill
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:21.080]  this was three weeks ago we played the clip kill obama no evidence just made up why if 9 11 truth
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:25.800]  is so silly and stupid why in congressional hearings and everywhere else are they saying we're so
[2:41:25.800 --> 2:41:31.960]  dangerous well up because the question that we see the wisdom of uh the government's viewpoint
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:37.400]  that they say there's something not right here uh sometimes they perhaps they go to the extremes
[2:41:37.400 --> 2:41:42.200]  and then then they get focused on nitpicking details but by and large the thrust of the 9 11
[2:41:42.200 --> 2:41:47.720]  truth people is we don't accept your lies we want a real investigation and of course that doesn't
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:57.000]  happen it's very frustrating uh maris burman wrote an excellent book called dark ages america and
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.480]  which he goes into great detail about how the united states is collapsing and there's no way out of it
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:13.400]  it really is collapsing and people in government how do they get cia and mi6 and israeli intelligence
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:19.480]  that edmund said it was also pakistani was involved uh and saudi arabian they're all together
[2:42:19.480 --> 2:42:25.000]  how do they get the average cia officer to be involved killing 3000 americans well i know the
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:30.360]  answer but i want to get your take on it go ahead well my view is a large part of the cia simply
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:34.600]  has no moral compass they have no backbone they do whatever they were told to do and they don't
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:41.880]  question it i read valerie plains book uh and it was just absolutely amazing how uh she went
[2:42:41.880 --> 2:42:47.480]  through all of this and he accepted whatever she was told to do and uh you know flax for uh you
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:55.480]  know a stronger uh intelligence service and it's outrageous that you know we have the best means
[2:42:55.480 --> 2:43:00.680]  of knowing what's you is good for you and you don't know all that we know so therefore you
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:06.680]  shouldn't participate in any of these decisions that's it it's the power trip it's the sex it's the
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:14.040]  money it's the drugs but more importantly they've got a lot of ideologues you know we can't forget
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:20.040]  in this whole thing christian zionist and and for those that don't know that that's separate from
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:25.560]  israel you've got christians like uh and she at least manipulates this point i don't think she
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:30.600]  really believes it the beauty queen sarah palin who says we've got to basically cause world war
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:37.960]  three to make jesus come back and and and they hate muslims so much that the argument is you don't
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:44.520]  understand how dangerous these billion 100 billion muslims are if we don't stage these events we won't
[2:43:44.520 --> 2:43:49.080]  get the backbone we need to go out and beat these people but then meanwhile the same government
[2:43:49.080 --> 2:43:53.000]  brings in record numbers of them if they're so bad why are they doing that so but i want you to comment
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:44:00.040]  on this but then expanding on that their argument of wealth i mean that goes back to generals 2000
[2:44:00.040 --> 2:44:07.560]  3000 years ago would say send in 500 cavalry to lead out the main enemy force of of 5000 we know
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:14.200]  our cavalry this small contingent will be wiped out but that's sacrificing a pawn in a chess game
[2:44:14.200 --> 2:44:20.360]  and so the rationale is hey we kill 3000 but we save america but that's another con game even if
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:24.200]  you were mackey of ellian and bought into this because that's not really what they're even doing
[2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:30.440]  well the thing with the arabs and the muslims is that in most of the world uh their countries are
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:37.480]  very poor and uh they're fixated on trying to stay alive and get enough to eat and get enough to
[2:44:37.480 --> 2:44:42.360]  drink and uh i don't really think that they're interested in world revolution or killing every
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:49.160]  american citizen in the in the united states uh the muslims i've met are remarkably pleasant
[2:44:50.680 --> 2:44:57.960]  solid pillars of the community but the americans demonized them and uh by their attacks around
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:45:01.480]  the world they they're they're pushing them steadily to the the radical side saying well you
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:05.160]  know these people are killing us these good christians who believe in jesus and the ten
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:10.920]  commandments including the one about thou shalt not kill uh they're uh by and large trying to
[2:45:10.920 --> 2:45:17.240]  destroy us in our way of life but it's worse than that as you know you're you're an educated man
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:23.400]  but for those that may not my film terror storm covers it at the muslims want to be secular
[2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:28.760]  they invented most the math we have our alphabet is arabic i mean the arabs are so bad folks
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:33.560]  this is arabic writing right here i mean i mean i mean this is the you know the ancient alphabet
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:42.040]  yeah and and uh you know what we use or or we'll be using roman numerals the point is is that
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:52.280]  they over and over again in egypt in saudi arabia in iran everywhere use radical muslims
[2:45:52.280 --> 2:45:58.680]  to overthrow secular governments because they don't want first world nations that can have
[2:45:58.680 --> 2:46:07.640]  an equal standing and this is a tool of literal imperialism uh of neocolonialism yeah the uh
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:12.680]  the united states supports repressive right wing regimes in egypt and in saudi arabia
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:18.440]  for example uh it's the united states that uh creates a situation in which there are
[2:46:20.040 --> 2:46:25.160]  two million or more internally displaced iraqis another two million or more uh
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:31.320]  uh refugees mostly in the middle east and then refuses to let the people who work for the american
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:37.000]  government in iraq come to the united states and if you could make it here they're given the back
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:42.440]  of uncle sam's hand well when you don't care about killing when you don't care about morals
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:47.320]  you are very powerful yeah uh because they don't have any rules and and look at the genius of the
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:51.640]  hegelian dialectic they use and this has been declassified the british really mastered this
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:58.200]  200 years ago i want you to comment on this mr springman they fund radical muslims and that's
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:02.680]  come out for 60 years they give them radical textbooks they fund the madrasas the state
[2:47:02.680 --> 2:47:08.040]  department does they then use them to overthrow those governments then they get to even use those
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:15.320]  radical muslims to then menace america so we become a police state i mean they they use both sides
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:20.600]  of it it's pure genius i mean it's fear the is always you're afraid of something and you're
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:25.000]  terrified of something you'll do anything to save yourself from the evil enemy
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:33.080]  and it's it's uh absolutely astonishing uh you know the uh i had a german peace activist
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:39.800]  once told me that uh um you know he could see gandy uh standing up to the british and india
[2:47:39.800 --> 2:47:44.360]  doing a peaceful nonviolent revolution but he said that he was convinced that if they tried this in
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:51.800]  in the benign period out of what had them all killed so that you're right you're you know repression
[2:47:52.840 --> 2:47:56.360]  you can do anything you want because you you have power and you simply want to
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:04.120]  kill people and if you do so you you have the the upper hand well for those that don't know
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:10.120]  the czar stayed in power for over 400 years staging terror attacks they did it every week and they'd
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:16.680]  arrest everybody and arrest their own police and say they did it hitler uh really came to power got
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:22.040]  full power february 27th 1933 with the rise tag he launched world war two against poland
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:29.400]  was by attacking his own basic gliwitz uh and it's the same i mean i remember three years ago it got
[2:48:29.400 --> 2:48:36.440]  a 2004 army manual for special forces captains in the army this is this is on wiki leaks the
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:40.600]  government admits it's real and says they want to prosecute whoever released it teaches army
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:46.600]  captains how to stage terror attacks i mean my god that they're they're training armies of terrorists
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:54.040]  i mean there are army captains listening right now who were trained out of stage terror
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:49:00.440]  how i mean is that how you win and and and what are you fighting for america's being destroyed
[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:06.120]  they keep arguing that america's city on the hill is the last great hope of the world it's uh
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:12.040]  it's this it's bad and the other thing and all i can see is that it's the constitution doesn't exist
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:16.600]  the principles on which the country was founded have been rejected by the government and uh
[2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:20.520]  they simply want to stay in power will do anything insane anything to keep things going the way they
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:26.600]  are but the world is waking up the average american starting to wake up but not fast enough but
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:32.120]  the world's a lot more awake than our average super bowl watching potato head yeah unfortunately
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:39.720]  but it's it's absolutely amazing it's absolutely terrifying it's absolutely depressing the uh
[2:49:41.720 --> 2:49:47.400]  go ahead now the the you know the americans uh you know you you have a peace demonstration and
[2:49:48.280 --> 2:49:52.760]  you have more people in a snowball fighting in dupe on circle than you do in the demonstration
[2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:57.800]  about justice for palestine or for ending the war in iraq or anything else and you know you you
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:02.760]  have a couple hundred people whereas a snowball flag can have a couple of thousand and then a
[2:50:02.760 --> 2:50:07.880]  still a crazy cop shows up and waves a gun at him did you see that yeah i saw that it's the good
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:14.440]  old dc the state of confusion and expanding on that the reason you only have a few hundred people
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:22.040]  at the g20 is the police came out and attacked anyone on the streets yeah and in denver in uh
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:30.440]  canada two years ago everywhere the police get the police dress up like anarchists to beat people
[2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:35.080]  up on the news to demonize all protesters you know what mr spring we had you for a full hour

[2:55:40.760 --> 2:55:45.720]  four members of five members former generals from the pentagon meeting with rumsfeld the the tv

[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:59.320]  in the four minutes we've got left with our guests j michael springman mike closing points facts you
[2:55:59.320 --> 2:56:05.000]  haven't talked about things you want the audience to know i guess the the one fact that people are
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:10.120]  to look at uh is that the department of state the agency that's charged with formulating
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:15.480]  and conducting american foreign policy is controlled by the indonesian services depending
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:21.320]  who you talk to and i've talked to a former cia station chief and a fellow whose last assignment
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:27.720]  was the inspector general's office somewhere between one third to one half or more of the people
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:33.800]  who say they're state department officials really work for the cia or nsa or something else uh and
[2:56:33.800 --> 2:56:40.680]  i would suggest maybe uh besides your uh your own websites uh people look at op ed news uh jason
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:49.080]  liabold's public record um michelle chossidofsky's global research dot ca up in canada uh and barry's
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:57.160]  wicker and um ian woods's global uh outlook dot ca and there's also the wane matteson report that
[2:56:57.160 --> 2:57:03.080]  comes out of washington dc absolutely we get wane on several times a month he's scheduled to be on
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:09.000]  later in the week um you know the facts are out there and i think overall there is an awakening
[2:57:09.640 --> 2:57:16.120]  taking place people now have it in their vernacular false flag inside job self-inflicted wound
[2:57:16.120 --> 2:57:22.680]  rise stag event uh i mean are you overall somewhat positive that at least people are waking up or do
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:29.880]  you disagree uh yes and no i mean people some people are starting to wake up the people who
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:35.560]  are a bit more progressive and who uh have a sense of history but by and large the the great
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:41.000]  mass of the american people are happy with things as they are because it's a fun fairy tale to hear
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:45.480]  that the islamic boogeyman's gonna get you if you don't go to the naked body scanner the only problem
[2:57:45.480 --> 2:57:53.160]  is the radical muslim works for cia yeah i mean the people have done studies about iraq and then
[2:57:53.160 --> 2:57:58.440]  terrorism and things like this and when they say remember pearl harvard uh americans who were
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:03.240]  interviewed say oh yeah you know we don't care what we do to those iraqis or whoever the brand of
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:09.000]  terrorists of the day is uh we're we're happy with when bad things happen to them when you talk about
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  um uh historical events such as uh what happened in poland or maybe in nazi germany then people
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:22.120]  start to think well maybe you know it isn't a good thing to uh uh declare as the president did that
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:28.200]  we get the right to kill any american citizen if we consider him to be a terrorist absolutely well

[2:58:50.680 --> 2:58:55.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:58:55.240 --> 2:58:59.560]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:58:59.560 --> 2:59:04.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:59:04.600 --> 2:59:10.200]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:15.320]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:59:15.320 --> 2:59:20.600]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:25.240]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[2:59:25.240 --> 2:59:30.600]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:35.000]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:40.920]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[3:00:23.400 --> 3:00:32.120]  this is going to be a jam at final hour with key information here's what i want to do
[3:00:34.600 --> 3:00:41.720]  i want to get into environmental brainwashing ads then sarah palin hijacking the tea party
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:47.160]  movement then i want to get more into the cyber security bill that passed and the internet censorship

[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:18.600]  planet dot tv viewers as well look to even try to cover this it almost does a disservice just to
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:27.800]  briefly cover i understand psychological warfare i understand programming because i'm a victim of
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:35.320]  it we all are but in the public schools all over the world they teach the kids to be climate cops
[3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:39.480]  and they give them little red shirts and little uniforms and they have them go home and write
[3:01:39.480 --> 3:01:44.520]  tickets to mommy and daddy and mommy and daddy say how cute yes i'm not supposed to brush my teeth
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:49.000]  with the sink running or take a hot bath or people need to be arrested if they get caught
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:56.440]  accidentally throwing a battery away in the trash and meanwhile all the real environmental crises
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:02:02.280]  toxic waste dumping genetic engineering open air planting and pharmacological crops that's not a
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:09.560]  problem and people see this ad they think it's a joke no this is what is currently planned in fact
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:14.760]  i have a clip in fall the republic where it shows them in the same uniforms they even got climate
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:22.920]  cop uniforms from new york state it's almost the exact same uniform swarming people images of cops
[3:02:22.920 --> 3:02:30.360]  swarming people everywhere remember during the grammy's they showed one of the big pop singers
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:34.920]  with men in black uniforms and black helmets marching and everybody was cheering them they're
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:41.000]  making it glamorous eight years running the number one styles camouflage you know it's this

[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:42.600]  and then i went and actually read the subversive activities registration act that we have a link
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:47.800]  to and now paul watson's written a key article that gives you the full spectrum analysis and they
[3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:55.320]  admit you're part of a militia or you're part of a group that criticizes the government and says
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:14:01.640]  our government's been taken over the adl or southern poverty loss center if they list you
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:08.280]  as a supposed subversive group as the mayack and homeland security reports do gun owners

[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:19.880]  yourself for a five dollar fee see they can't see the headlines are terrorists must register but they
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:24.840]  would arrest a terrorist then when you actually read it it's anybody that criticizes the government
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:31.640]  and they get you on a tax issue it's like they pass the first gun laws under taxes they say

[3:18:21.480 --> 3:18:27.480]  representatives is a basic function of democracy itself all of our republic but this law effectively

[3:18:51.080 --> 3:18:56.040]  that among these are life liberty in the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments
[3:18:56.040 --> 3:19:00.360]  are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the government
[3:19:00.360 --> 3:19:04.600]  that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:11.240]  the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such
[3:19:11.240 --> 3:19:16.280]  principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect
[3:19:16.280 --> 3:19:23.320]  their safety and happiness states the declaration of independence under the sweeping

[3:24:28.920 --> 3:24:34.040]  in oregon if you protest in any way it just says if you protest uh they wanted to ban
[3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:38.680]  criticizing the government four years ago in rhoda island that was in the providence journal
[3:24:38.680 --> 3:24:44.360]  it was on the local tv station and it almost passed for the public had a rally against it
[3:24:45.800 --> 3:24:50.360]  now south carolina and other states south carolina has passed it other states are on the
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:59.480]  verge of passing it that if you wish to control the government by acts of political protest anything
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:05.880]  and that if you even believe it's proper that the people should control the government that's
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:10.520]  how this reads you are a terrorist and then no one ever tells you and they come and say you've
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:21.960]  been designated an extremist you're going to get 10 years in prison 25 000 fine this is
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:26.120]  prison planet dot com headline right now this needs to get out to everybody i mean this
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:31.880]  is an outrageous government under the sweeping terms of the law members of tax protest organizations
[3:25:31.880 --> 3:25:36.040]  the tea party movement and the states rights movement based in south carolina are all
[3:25:36.040 --> 3:25:40.760]  domestic terrorists if they fail to register their dissent with the authorities the authorities the
[3:25:40.760 --> 3:25:47.240]  bosses you come register yourself like registering a firearm or it's over this is because you do
[3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:50.920]  have a lawless criminal government the people are standing up going we're going to take our
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:55.240]  government back we're going to have the states declare sovereignty tenth amendment a declaration
[3:25:55.240 --> 3:26:01.640]  of independence we're taking no you're not listen we got weapons we've built camps we're going to
[3:26:01.640 --> 3:26:06.520]  take everything you got we're going to turn the eco police loose on you you're a slave got it
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:16.120]  it is important to stress that the notion that law somehow only applies to Islamic
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:19.720]  terrorists is completely at odds with the fact that federal and state authorities now consider
[3:26:19.720 --> 3:26:23.880]  the main terror threat to be from informed american citizens exercising their constitutional
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:28.760]  rights an opposition to big government agenda they are being subjected to then we have a link
[3:26:28.760 --> 3:26:34.280]  to the myac report and other state reports as we saw the myac report and a plethora of other
[3:26:34.280 --> 3:26:39.640]  similar training manuals which are leaked over the last decade police are being trained that
[3:26:39.640 --> 3:26:44.760]  libertarians gun owners ron paul supporters anyone who is mildly political is a domestic
[3:26:44.760 --> 3:26:49.720]  extremist at a potential terrorist these people are the real target of the subversive list in
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:56.600]  south carolina the infamous phoenix federal bureau of investigation manual and we have that there
[3:26:56.600 --> 3:27:02.280]  produced an association with the joint terrorism task force listed quote defenders of the u.s
[3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:07.960]  constitution and lone individuals quote as terrorists will anyone in south carolina who
[3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:13.080]  defends the constitution the very bedrock of what america stands for have to register with
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:18.520]  authorities unless they want to be locked up for a decade of course since nobody is going to register
[3:27:18.520 --> 3:27:23.800]  as a subversive the south carolina authorities their failure to comply with the regulation
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:29.000]  will later be used against them as a means of eliciting criminal charges and represents a clear
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:35.160]  in run around the first amendment the government isn't going to just come out and ban uh come out
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:40.440]  with all guns blazing and ban free speech they're simply going to make anyone who refuses to register
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:48.600]  for permission a criminal for failing to adhere to the separate mandate just like people in places
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:52.760]  such as new york and chicago were told that they had to get a license to purchase a gun
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:27:58.360]  then at first the process was a mere inconvenience but now the licensing process means they will
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:02.920]  have to jump through 200 flaming hoops and the second amendment has effectively been outlawed
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:07.720]  in these cities they won't hesitate to pull the same tricks with the first amendment and it's
[3:28:07.720 --> 3:28:12.760]  already happening free speech zones all of it with calls to license internet users and force them
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:22.120]  to get government permission to run a website and folks i have this stack this stack this stack

[3:43:16.200 --> 3:43:21.800]  texas and alaska are a lot alike we have some really sweet connections we are both full of
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:28.360]  independent pioneering spirited people and big wide open spaces we're loving our outdoors loving
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:35.960]  that hunting and that fishing and great energy producers lots of connections there many of us

[3:43:51.800 --> 3:43:57.320]  we certainly love the patriots who serve us in uniform and served us in the past
[3:44:00.680 --> 3:44:05.720]  and i would like to ask those of you who have served this great country in uniform in the past

[3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:30.520]  safety and security for our loved ones and we just want a smaller smarter government that'll
[3:44:30.520 --> 3:44:34.600]  kind of get out of our way and let the private sector grow and thrive and prosper
[3:44:34.600 --> 3:44:42.920]  remember george bush saying this in 2000 and no one understands that better than my good friend
[3:44:42.920 --> 3:44:51.320]  rick perry and texas is lucky to have him now governor perry and i we have known each other
[3:44:51.320 --> 3:44:56.760]  for some years now all right then she goes on energy issues and to say send a message to
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:02.360]  washington elect rick perry a message that we've all been conned we're a bunch of idiots down here
[3:45:02.360 --> 3:45:07.160]  and we like george bush style lies about don't get involved in other countries cut the size of
[3:45:07.160 --> 3:45:12.840]  government he tripled the size of it you're being robbed and they send in this flusy this tart
[3:45:13.480 --> 3:45:21.080]  to sit there and sell you on this now here's the really bone chilling part of what she had to say
[3:45:21.080 --> 3:45:29.800]  here's the quote on fox news this is a quote say he decided talking about obama say he decided
[3:45:29.800 --> 3:45:36.920]  to declare war on iran oh or decided really to come out and do whatever he could to support israel
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:41.080]  which i would like him to do so that would support it go let's let's declare war on iran
[3:45:42.200 --> 3:45:48.280]  i mean israel is one of the biggest controllers of the white house i mean rama manuals it is an
[3:45:48.280 --> 3:45:55.400]  ergon you know israeli uh military man i mean it's a complete joke but they give him left cover
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:46:00.680]  saying he doesn't support israel say he decided to declare war on iran or decided really to come out
[3:46:00.680 --> 3:46:05.480]  and do whatever he could to support israel which i would like him to do palin told fox news chris
[3:46:05.480 --> 3:46:13.000]  wallis sunday she went on that changes the dynamics and what we can assume is going to happen between
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:20.840]  now and three years and this is what the neocons have all been saying they said in three editorials
[3:46:20.840 --> 3:46:28.600]  last week remember attack iran save your presidency attack iran i mean it's all about having a crisis
[3:46:28.600 --> 3:46:34.920]  being a war god being a war president it's all a giant fraud when our government over through
[3:46:34.920 --> 3:46:41.160]  iran in 53 was using muslim extremists overthrown over and over again set up torture camps over
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:47.960]  there iran has put out all the branch after all of branch and the media never even reports on it
[3:46:47.960 --> 3:46:53.960]  they want a new war let's go to her on fox news want to start world war three i know the three
[3:46:53.960 --> 3:46:59.960]  years as an eternity in politics but how hard do you think president obama will be to defeat
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:07.000]  in 2012 it depends on a few things say he played and i i got this from bucanon reading one of his
[3:47:07.000 --> 3:47:13.960]  columns the other day say he played the war card say he decided to declare war on iran or decided
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:18.440]  to really come out and do whatever he could to support israel which i would like him to do but
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:24.280]  that changes the dynamics and in what we can assume is going to happen between now and three
[3:47:24.280 --> 3:47:28.280]  years because i think if the election were today i do not think obama would be reelected
[3:47:28.280 --> 3:47:33.800]  but three years from now things could change if if um on the national security president suggesting
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:38.200]  that he would cynically play the war card i'm not suggesting that i'm saying if he did things would
[3:47:38.200 --> 3:47:45.720]  dramatically change if he decided to tough it up and do all that he can that's another nation and
[3:47:45.720 --> 3:47:53.720]  look at how do duplicitous she is she says if he declared war and and which i think he should do
[3:47:53.720 --> 3:47:59.640]  and supported israel which i think he should do and if he played the war card and then he goes
[3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:04.360]  well you're not saying that she goes no i'm saying he should toughen up she's saying that they're
[3:48:04.360 --> 3:48:11.000]  writing editorials she gets the most hardcore neocon talking points they roll the tart out
[3:48:11.560 --> 3:48:18.760]  they roll the milf out for everyone in the world to sit there salivating at this disgusting grandma
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:27.480]  and everyone is supposed to just fold down and start worshiping her you've got someone telling you
[3:48:27.480 --> 3:48:35.560]  they want world war three and i guess it's what you want you you want the super bowl instead of
[3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:42.200]  your property you want sarah palin and dancing with the stars instead of your bill of rights
[3:48:42.200 --> 3:48:49.240]  and your constitution and to run your own life you republican idiots you're laughing at obama's
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:54.840]  bad fortunes i told you he was going to plunge i came out day one against him i came out against
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:49:00.360]  clinton i came out against bush they're all puppets can't you get this elementary thing through
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:08.760]  your stinking brains and save america bush and obama are identical on every major issue don't
[3:49:08.760 --> 3:49:16.600]  you understand that cast sunstein running the white house is a top neocon who wants to ban
[3:49:16.600 --> 3:49:21.480]  free speech in america can't you get it through your head obama has continued the torture the
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:29.240]  patriot act all of it that is designed for you the people of this country we have the internal
[3:49:29.240 --> 3:49:36.200]  homeland security reports we have the mike report the whole thing north com the army it's all set
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:45.160]  up for we the people it is all set up for the american people it is for us and i know most of
[3:49:45.160 --> 3:49:53.160]  my great audience knows that but you better get the word out to these bedwetting republicans
[3:49:53.160 --> 3:49:58.920]  these chicken neck cowardly pieces of trash that go to these hotel bankwoods and sit around talking
[3:49:58.920 --> 3:50:05.240]  about nuke and brown people and feeling tough and giggle and smirk about big government real
[3:50:05.800 --> 3:50:10.920]  libertarian conservative constitutionalist would want debor medina for the texas governor to send
[3:50:10.920 --> 3:50:16.120]  a message all across the states that we're putting real constitutionalist in who'll defend our borders
[3:50:16.120 --> 3:50:23.320]  and who will abolish the anti gun laws and who will get rid of the property tax but no we got to
[3:50:23.320 --> 3:50:29.080]  have rick perry who every new job he's added in texas has been in government who gave us the new
[3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:35.560]  business tax which is really a state income tax and who gave us all these new taxes that's who she
[3:50:35.560 --> 3:50:42.120]  says is good and the rnc and steel and the rest of them set up against obama they look pretty good
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:47.160]  from a republican view just like obama looks good from a democratic view that's how they keep republicans
[3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:53.640]  and democrats on the reservation as moron idiot slaves you like being chumped you like being con

[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.160]  to care for themselves we would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and
[3:51:21.160 --> 3:51:26.280]  the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue if the experience of
[3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:32.280]  the katrina disaster is evidence the breadline may have no bread just like the good intentions
[3:51:32.280 --> 3:51:37.240]  on the road to that unheavenly place the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will
[3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:42.760]  not feed us only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the
