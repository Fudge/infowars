[02:19.960 --> 02:24.920]  psychologist and social scientist in the US in the UK at major universities
[02:24.920 --> 02:30.560]  suggest that contrary to mainstream or brainwashed stereotypes those label
[02:30.560 --> 02:33.840]  conspiracy theorist appear to be saner than those who accept the official
[02:33.840 --> 02:42.160]  versions of contested events that's like the Democrats they are still busy
[02:42.160 --> 02:49.400]  running around saying that Obamacare is a great thing and then if you don't
[02:49.400 --> 02:54.360]  agree with that you are a bad guy and it's the same thing they come out and
[02:54.360 --> 03:01.920]  move to get the the the the Alamo you in World Heritage Site designation which in
[03:01.920 --> 03:06.360]  the agreement says 7 square miles have building restrictions on them and that
[03:06.360 --> 03:10.000]  every other mission in San Antonio going under it has similar controls and
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.880]  it's in the treaty and it's on record what it does so the media comes out and
[03:13.880 --> 03:19.680]  says there is no UN period involvement Alex Jones is a liar same media that
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.680]  says there are no domestic drones QE 3 doesn't devalue the dollar
[03:24.680 --> 03:29.200]  Obamacare is going to work great there are no death panels they just lie to you
[03:29.200 --> 03:34.520]  and people don't feel empowered so they just go well it must be true because
[03:34.520 --> 03:37.480]  they wouldn't lie to me because I don't want to feel like I'm a loser you're a
[03:37.480 --> 03:45.720]  loser accepting the con game you're a loser going along with this corruption
[03:45.720 --> 03:54.240]  you're a loser putting up with the garbage you're a loser when you buy into
[03:54.240 --> 04:01.200]  the con that if you imagine that you're not being conned that somehow it's like
[04:01.200 --> 04:04.800]  Oprah Winfrey in the secret I can't tell you how many people I know who believe
[04:04.800 --> 04:10.640]  that if they just think something it's going to happen sure confidence in sales
[04:10.640 --> 04:16.720]  confidence in dating it has a big effect but you can be as confident as you
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.120]  want to be and walk up to a 50-story skyscraper that has concrete below and
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.440]  jump off and you will die when you hit the concrete below you will die unless
[04:26.440 --> 04:29.560]  you hit a bunch of awnings or something on the way down people have lived because
[04:29.560 --> 04:32.400]  they hit four or five awnings you know break their back and every other bone
[04:32.400 --> 04:38.680]  but they live you are not going to just have Oprah Winfrey's the secret and jump
[04:38.680 --> 04:42.120]  off a building and then sprout wings and fly it on to the bottom that isn't how
[04:42.120 --> 04:47.320]  that works okay so we're gonna come back get into all of it a man has been banned

[08:16.880 --> 08:21.040]  GCN radio network
[08:28.240 --> 08:32.920]  my friends it's Friday and we're gonna have open phones for first-time callers
[08:32.920 --> 08:38.000]  on any subject or news item you wish to raise I love the wild card element of it

[08:41.920 --> 08:50.280]  free number to join us for first-time callers 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 we've
[08:50.280 --> 08:54.400]  got a ton of obviously very important news to get to but I want to make
[08:54.400 --> 09:02.200]  something clear up front it's Hillary Clinton's job to be discredited and take
[09:02.200 --> 09:07.480]  the blame and be politically destroyed and then rebuilt again it's Barack
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.360]  Obama's job to be politically built up then destroyed then built back up again
[09:12.360 --> 09:15.960]  to take the blame for what the establishment's doing you know I've
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.720]  had the analogy for more than 15 years on air that many of you've heard that's
[09:21.720 --> 09:24.840]  been picked up by a lot of folks and that's always good because it's a good
[09:24.840 --> 09:28.520]  way to telegraph information to folks that the Republican and Democratic
[09:28.520 --> 09:33.720]  parties to the offshore banking cartels that are above the law tax example
[09:33.720 --> 09:40.280]  diplomatic community they are like body armor on a night thousand years ago in
[09:40.280 --> 09:46.920]  say France and the Republican Democratic parties are like a shield and the
[09:46.920 --> 09:52.520]  shield gets all dead up and gets damaged and bashed in and there's holes in it
[09:52.520 --> 09:56.480]  after four to eight years with a presidential front man or puppet and
[09:56.480 --> 10:02.760]  then the establishment throws down that shield and they pick up a new shield a
[10:02.760 --> 10:06.920]  new Republican or Democratic front person that they finance and put into
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.000]  power and this has never been more obvious than it is with Obama as many
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.880]  have joked he's the third or fourth term of George W. Bush or one could argue that
[10:19.880 --> 10:27.440]  he is the fifth or sixth term for the Clintons it really doesn't matter
[10:27.440 --> 10:32.480]  because when you look at Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells Fargo and
[10:32.480 --> 10:35.560]  the other big Federal Reserve shareholders of the big mega banks that
[10:35.560 --> 10:38.800]  literally control the issuance of currency and credit in this giant rig
[10:38.800 --> 10:42.600]  casino and who were taking over our world and waging war against the free
[10:42.600 --> 10:49.320]  market when you really look at it it's the exact same people behind both major
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.280]  political parties punching the buttons pulling the strings giving the orders
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.280]  and you've got total continuity of agenda between administration after
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.520]  administration really really since Kennedy got his head blown off I mean
[11:03.520 --> 11:06.520]  that's really you always had corruption you always had special interests you
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.720]  always had problems but there would be different power structures at certain
[11:10.720 --> 11:15.880]  levels in there struggling for control there was a lobby for workers and there
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.560]  was a manufacturing lobby and there was a state's lobby and there was a Christian
[11:19.560 --> 11:29.440]  lobby now there's just a big mega bank foreign bank cartel lobby that is
[11:29.440 --> 11:36.600]  running the show and all they need is the illusion that things are changing on
[11:36.600 --> 11:42.120]  the surface can somebody get me a water I forgot to get one I'm throat straw thank
[11:42.120 --> 11:47.760]  you and when you sit there and look at this now that's why things are so
[11:47.760 --> 11:52.640]  corrupt and that's why the establishment and basically get away with
[11:52.640 --> 11:59.320]  bloody murder is that there are no other special interests that are even
[11:59.320 --> 12:03.640]  corrupt to compete with the globalist see the founders wanted to balance the
[12:03.640 --> 12:11.360]  power a separation of power a constitution a a bill of rights a
[12:11.360 --> 12:18.640]  states versus the feds two branches of the Congress legislative the executive
[12:18.640 --> 12:30.440]  the the different groups the judicial knowing there would be powerful corrupt
[12:30.440 --> 12:34.000]  individuals at different levels of it but but hoping that it would tie the
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.600]  hands of one central dictatorship or one central oligarchy to come into power
[12:38.600 --> 12:42.360]  if they could play off these different power structures against each other
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.280]  it's basically an architecture and it worked better than the other system we've
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.600]  seen to restrain corruption to restrain one central group getting in control in
[12:51.600 --> 12:58.840]  the stagnation and corruption that invariably leads from all of that and so
[12:58.840 --> 13:03.440]  I just wanted to state today up front that's why things are so bad and we
[13:03.440 --> 13:12.520]  have these corporate interests that are basically now trying to cement and
[13:12.520 --> 13:18.040]  establish their illegitimate takeover of society and that's why they want to put
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.160]  authoritarianism in and dumb down the population is so that there's no
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.960]  resistance to the total hegemonic control that they are attempting to put into
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.360]  place and they're not in full control yet there isn't a total global government
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.480]  yet there isn't total currency and cash controls yet we haven't been totally
[13:34.480 --> 13:40.600]  dumbed down and vulcanized and atomized politically yet but you can see the road
[13:40.600 --> 13:49.160]  that we're going down only gets worse thank you for the water and so I'm just
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.760]  here pointing out to the nouveau riche the some of the establishment people that
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.720]  aren't totally evil and for folks that really want to have a prosperous and
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.840]  stable future for your children if you're not completely evil and completely
[14:02.840 --> 14:07.400]  into just raw destructive plot power you should be firmly against the New
[14:07.400 --> 14:14.240]  World Order because it is basically like signing on with Sauron to take over all
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.480]  of Middle Earth if you want to use that analogy I mean that this is madness to
[14:18.480 --> 14:23.160]  make a deal with this and just say that it's a good idea and a wonderful thing
[14:23.160 --> 14:33.680]  so you're gonna see articles like this one in the press out there in places
[14:33.680 --> 14:39.240]  like the week calm saying why is Hillary Clinton's popularity sliding well I
[14:39.240 --> 14:44.440]  mean who cares she's just a CIA operative since the 60s who's here to
[14:44.440 --> 14:49.080]  break down the US and collectivizes while picking up lots of hot young
[14:49.080 --> 14:54.920]  girlfriends I mean that's that's what Hillary Clinton does and then we see
[14:54.920 --> 14:58.840]  articles about Obama he's plunging he's in trouble the point is is you've got
[14:58.840 --> 15:03.800]  the Republican leadership with Obama and the state-run media all attacking the
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.400]  libertarian tea party right now because if they are able to point out that it's
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.180]  the globalist that are wrecking things the globalist may get the blame and may
[15:12.180 --> 15:17.880]  get in trouble for what they've done and we could have a real restoration of our
[15:17.880 --> 15:25.160]  republic if we have a real debate about this then the worst common denominator
[15:25.160 --> 15:29.680]  in politics and in special interest won't be able to govern our entire
[15:29.680 --> 15:35.840]  society and take over our world and so with that backdrop we have to understand
[15:35.840 --> 15:41.200]  that we're dealing with an inbred group of royalty and other powerful families
[15:41.200 --> 15:46.600]  who universally in their own publications say they believe humanity's a bunch
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.440]  of ugly trash we're eating up their resources the world is theirs we're an
[15:51.440 --> 16:00.160]  infestation that must be cold that must be removed that must be gotten rid of and
[16:00.160 --> 16:05.160]  so whether you want to believe that reality or not that reality is there
[16:05.160 --> 16:11.120]  that reality is the policy and the point from which this whole system flows I
[16:11.120 --> 16:18.440]  mean here's an article today on the Associated Press AP editors Obama relies
[16:18.440 --> 16:24.600]  on stage propaganda photos and it's not like we need AP to tell us that but for
[16:24.600 --> 16:30.240]  the public that's a revelation that that that government and media are even
[16:30.240 --> 16:38.040]  staging things we've got other articles here where top hospitals opt out of
[16:38.040 --> 16:42.400]  Obamacare and US News and World Report again the top hospitals with the big
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.840]  insurance companies and banks wrote Obamacare they don't have to be under
[16:46.840 --> 16:53.600]  it only smaller hospital chains state-run city hospitals real charity
[16:53.600 --> 16:59.640]  hospitals and real private hospitals they are all to be shut down so there
[16:59.640 --> 17:03.800]  it is from US News and World Report just like all the big corporations are
[17:03.800 --> 17:09.280]  exempt from Obamacare it's only for you that doesn't have a lobby anything that
[17:09.280 --> 17:13.200]  comes out of this system it's the same globalist looting Greece looting
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.560]  Argentina looting the United States I mean we know what they do because we've
[17:18.560 --> 17:24.760]  watched them do it over and over again not just here but other places it's it's
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.040]  very very simple to understand it's like watching a baby bird fall out of a tree
[17:28.040 --> 17:31.640]  and watching somebody's cat jump off the front porch and run up and grab the
[17:31.640 --> 17:35.960]  bird and eat it you don't know what the cat's going to do when it drags the
[17:35.960 --> 17:40.880]  bird off because you've seen it before you know what the cat does to baby birds
[17:40.880 --> 17:49.320]  or does to baby mice oh but don't worry Issa is gonna have a hearing about it
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.680]  just like fast and furious everything else and then nothing will be done but
[17:53.680 --> 17:57.240]  they'll score some more fake political points instead of actually moving to have
[17:57.240 --> 18:02.000]  these criminals arrested and then Pat Buchanan has an article out the first
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.680]  hustler runs the big con and of course told you in the last six years hundreds
[18:08.680 --> 18:16.160]  of times that they would never kick you off a plan and let you keep your plan so
[18:16.160 --> 18:21.600]  let's play a short compilation of Obama just just reminds you of how he lied to
[18:21.600 --> 18:27.960]  you we will keep this promise to the American people if you like your doctor
[18:27.960 --> 18:32.920]  you will be able to keep your doctor that's 2009 if you like your health care

[24:00.320 --> 24:11.760]  it's always a tough boat because the average person thinks raising the debt
[24:11.760 --> 24:15.560]  ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling which
[24:15.560 --> 24:20.720]  has done been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt it does not
[24:20.720 --> 24:26.040]  somehow promote profit is he all it does is it says you gotta pay the bills that
[24:26.040 --> 24:41.240]  you've already racked up got your listening to the Alex Jones show you
[24:41.240 --> 24:46.280]  know back in 1990 just see another type of evil we're dealing with in northern
[24:46.280 --> 24:51.560]  Europe in Western Europe in England and in the United States all at the same
[24:51.560 --> 24:59.120]  concerted time they began mandated basically under UNESCO UN guidelines
[24:59.120 --> 25:01.680]  that's what our Department of Education is under and so are these other
[25:01.680 --> 25:04.720]  Department of Education that's why from Australia to the US it's the same
[25:04.720 --> 25:11.040]  programs same names in most cases global standardization through regulatory
[25:11.040 --> 25:16.200]  systems agenda 21 is just part of that on the environment to take over society
[25:16.200 --> 25:20.600]  and centralized control by these arrogant globalists who see us as a plague
[25:20.600 --> 25:29.600]  when they're really the plague they came out and began death education and
[25:29.600 --> 25:35.320]  suicide prevention as part of death education having kids get in coffins
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.360]  having children be rolled up in blankets and have kids sit on them to simulate
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.280]  death so that children that never thought about death would then get into it and
[25:44.280 --> 25:47.920]  begin thinking about it and I want to do a report on the nightly news tonight or
[25:47.920 --> 25:50.800]  maybe on the Sunday shows I was just thinking about this during the break
[25:50.800 --> 25:53.680]  one of the guys pointed something out to me and I want to go back and show
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.360]  people the backstory on this because we've covered this so long and now we've
[25:57.360 --> 26:01.360]  gotten to this point where they came out about a month ago in a big national
[26:01.360 --> 26:05.640]  study we covered here and said wow all over the country anti-bullying training
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.920]  triples bullying well yeah you go tell 11 year old girls how to strangle
[26:11.920 --> 26:17.160]  themselves with a shoestring hanging it on a coat rack in the bathroom and you
[26:17.160 --> 26:22.600]  teach 500 girls that in a school of a thousand in every school sometimes three
[26:22.600 --> 26:25.240]  or four because they would copy each other that's what little girls do they
[26:25.240 --> 26:28.640]  would go hang themselves there have been national news stories about this like
[26:28.640 --> 26:36.120]  did it backfire it didn't backfire for 40 years or more it just came out in the
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.720]  news again last week they have kids play spaceship or lifeboat and go we need
[26:40.720 --> 26:47.400]  policemen we need teachers we need bureaucrats we don't need we don't need you
[26:47.400 --> 26:50.560]  know librarians or whatever and then they decide who's thrown off the spaceship
[26:50.560 --> 26:53.400]  or who's thrown off the lifeboat because there's not enough food for
[26:53.400 --> 26:58.960]  everybody so we've got to decide who did who who dies other CBS news anti-bullying
[26:58.960 --> 27:02.920]  programs are having a opposite effect and they ask are they and of course it's
[27:02.920 --> 27:10.560]  a tripling in the overall rate in the 50 states in a major study of seven
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.760]  thousand students but shifting gears the point is John bound goes why didn't you
[27:15.760 --> 27:21.720]  cover yesterday it was in your stack and I saw you talking about it why didn't
[27:21.720 --> 27:28.200]  you talk about Belgium and the Netherlands and others are set if kids
[27:28.200 --> 27:31.720]  want to commit suicide and of course folks you can't come to a kid to say
[27:31.720 --> 27:36.040]  you're you're 12 do you want to have an abortion you have the parental right well
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.480]  now they do that in California now your parents don't count now you make the
[27:40.480 --> 27:43.480]  decision well they're a minor that's why you can't go convince a minor to have
[27:43.480 --> 27:47.800]  sex with you or a minor to use drugs they don't have free will every culture
[27:47.800 --> 27:53.880]  has said and you can't have outsiders the state saying it's their free will to
[27:53.880 --> 27:57.040]  have an abortion with your kid or their free will to give them a morning after
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.720]  pill or their free will to give them inoculations they're now passing laws so
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.640]  you heard about decades ago in Europe they pass laws saying kids have rights
[28:06.640 --> 28:09.440]  to divorce their parents and all this just if they don't like them or their
[28:09.440 --> 28:12.880]  parents are Christians or whatever they'll take them away or or or the
[28:12.880 --> 28:16.080]  parents don't want the five-year-old to be a lesbian because the school taught
[28:16.080 --> 28:19.440]  them that they were a lesbian it's not pedophilia when you do that it's
[28:19.440 --> 28:23.960]  loving liberalness so you could go then be taken away and you know do whatever
[28:23.960 --> 28:29.000]  you want at age five if you want well now the states teaching the kids that if
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.800]  you want to commit suicide will help you right now and CBS News is reporting it
[28:34.800 --> 28:39.360]  NBC News is reporting it the London Telegraph is reporting it Belgium
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.040]  considering new euthanasia law for kids and they report it like it's no big
[28:43.040 --> 28:49.560]  deal and so they say in California they will give you money prizes on discount
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.680]  cards they will give you video games you name it if you go and you get the
[28:54.680 --> 28:59.520]  inoculations or if you have the abortion so they tell your kids we will pay you to
[28:59.520 --> 29:04.560]  have an abortion and your parents don't count I mean that is just light years
[29:04.560 --> 29:10.960]  past the Soviet Union just like you're telling the army if you're a Christian
[29:10.960 --> 29:14.840]  or you're part of the Tea Party we're going to arrest you and then that's a
[29:14.840 --> 29:20.000]  footnote and Fox News asked is that good can't say oh my gosh we're in trouble
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.640]  no see it's all part of acclimating now the supposed opposition news just says
[29:24.640 --> 29:28.480]  is that good remember last year Paul Watson published an article that for a
[29:28.480 --> 29:31.240]  week no one picked up because they didn't believe it from the Journal of
[29:31.240 --> 29:35.000]  Bioethics saying kill children even healthy up to age three of the parents
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.680]  wanted to then finally people admitted it was real it was a big national story
[29:40.680 --> 29:45.520]  a year and a half later it's like well of course we're gonna kill kids and if
[29:45.520 --> 29:50.200]  your 10-year-old wants to we'll give them the pills to do it we're on the

[33:20.720 --> 33:35.360]  resistance it's Alex Jones by the way in 1992 2020 on ABC News I know because I
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.240]  had the tape years ago and play clips of it on my access television show in
[33:39.240 --> 33:45.360]  1996 and did investigations of it that they had a doubling tripling or
[33:45.360 --> 33:50.680]  quadrupling depending on which study or report you looked at of suicide
[33:50.680 --> 33:56.720]  right after they started teaching the most impressionable coast-to-coast the
[33:56.720 --> 34:01.360]  first school to start it was Littleton in Colorado basically hardcore mind
[34:01.360 --> 34:06.160]  control program teaching the intermediate school children sixth
[34:06.160 --> 34:11.480]  seventh eighth graders how to commit suicide and then they stood back and
[34:11.480 --> 34:16.600]  said we have no idea the teachers and folks the school that's how
[34:16.600 --> 34:19.800]  compartmentalized they were with cognitive dissidents there's no way the
[34:19.800 --> 34:22.800]  feds would give them a program that would make kids kill themselves so what
[34:22.800 --> 34:32.640]  did they do they increased the anti-suicide but also death training and
[34:32.640 --> 34:37.400]  again I bet it's on YouTube I haven't even checked you can find death
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.040]  educations the actual term in coffins putting six-year-olds in and teaching
[34:43.040 --> 34:48.000]  them how to hang themselves and then you wonder the dare program increased drug
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.320]  use on record teaching the kids how to use drugs you we sort of go all the
[34:51.320 --> 34:54.960]  cops don't know that no the average cop doesn't know that they've been
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.800]  selected because they don't know that they're in their teaching kids how to
[34:58.800 --> 35:03.320]  use drugs and others how to tattle on people using drugs to fill the private
[35:03.320 --> 35:08.080]  prisons to prime the children for a life of crime this is a total war on
[35:08.080 --> 35:14.320]  humanity folks this is eugenics this is population reduction and we've gotten to
[35:14.320 --> 35:19.760]  the point that I've become so acclimated I've become so prepared myself just
[35:19.760 --> 35:27.840]  living with this evil that it comes out in CBS News NBC News London Telegraph is
[35:27.840 --> 35:31.680]  one of the top stories in the country
[35:33.280 --> 35:37.680]  they actually found a world net daily article from back a decade ago about
[35:37.680 --> 35:41.040]  death education at Columbine good job that's what's so good about having a
[35:41.040 --> 35:45.480]  world net daily since 96 they covered it all you print that for me guys see
[35:45.480 --> 35:48.880]  here's what happens I see one article and then a thousand I've seen over the
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.120]  years literally popping my mind and then I think about all the other connections
[35:54.120 --> 35:59.760]  and I freak out I'm not kidding that's why I get so angry on air that's a defense
[35:59.760 --> 36:04.120]  mechanism against not crying folks they're teaching children everywhere how
[36:04.120 --> 36:10.200]  to commit suicide right now and then they use the increased suicide to increase
[36:10.200 --> 36:16.360]  more suicide training and they give them suicide mass murder pills and then
[36:16.360 --> 36:23.400]  Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien and Comedy Central and all the other shows
[36:23.400 --> 36:28.440]  they all make jokes every major comedy show in the country I saw at least seven
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.280]  or eight of them shows I don't even watch or know the names of but you know
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.880]  big big folks I've heard the name of it don't really know who they are they all
[36:35.880 --> 36:39.520]  made jokes with me about mass murder suicide pills because they had to hide
[36:39.520 --> 36:44.520]  it in plain view oh he says the shootings are happening at schools because
[36:44.520 --> 36:47.480]  they're always on mass murder suicide pills that's what they should be called
[36:47.480 --> 36:50.720]  the insert says causes mass murder and suicide
[36:50.720 --> 37:01.240]  megalomania delusions of grandeur and even 2020 admitted in Columbine it
[37:01.240 --> 37:07.600]  tripled suicides yeah there it is that she's my memory they found it from 13
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.560]  years ago I was correct look at that of course that's a world that daily reported
[37:11.560 --> 37:15.960]  I remember this from 1996 when somebody sent me the tape a concerned listener
[37:15.960 --> 37:18.800]  the tape was aired on British television in the Atlantic Monthly did a
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.840]  feature story the producer 2020 saw the video and decided to do a segment of the
[37:22.840 --> 37:28.160]  death education which was aired in 1990 so my memory is photographic on that but
[37:28.160 --> 37:31.160]  not anymore folks like everything pre about five years ago it's almost
[37:31.160 --> 37:35.800]  photographic now it's not so I've got to double check myself I remember that
[37:35.800 --> 37:39.080]  video very well because it was called the freelance writer was working on the
[37:39.080 --> 37:43.240]  story and send her some of the newsletters I wrote on the subject we
[37:43.240 --> 37:46.360]  should get these writers and these people that lost their kids in fact I've
[37:46.360 --> 37:50.800]  interviewed Austinites over the years once I aired this all these Austinites
[37:50.800 --> 37:54.360]  contacted me including one that was a medical doctor and his 11-year-old
[37:54.360 --> 38:01.200]  doc daughter totally happy totally playing sports playing basketball playing
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.320]  lacrosse at champion swimmer she's what we're having the flashbacks folks of the
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.080]  data in this fight and I just see the yuppies laughing about it as they murder
[38:10.080 --> 38:14.000]  our children by design it's so funny to them by implanting mind control in their
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.880]  brains to make them kill themselves have all the studies and actuaries they
[38:17.880 --> 38:22.160]  know what percentage of kids will kill themselves when they tell them the sad
[38:22.160 --> 38:27.640]  story of another little girl that was said for her boyfriend they know about
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.080]  the phenomenon with Romeo and Juliet when they would do Shakespeare plays
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.920]  statistically to large crowds a lot of times women would go kill themselves so
[38:36.920 --> 38:40.560]  the globalist that's one data point they got they did a test of it they teach
[38:40.560 --> 38:44.600]  them a Romeo Juliet story but they'll tell them a real story of a girl and how
[38:44.600 --> 38:48.440]  sad it was that she killed herself for a love the little girls are so touched by
[38:48.440 --> 38:52.880]  it and want to have a feeling of connection to the little girl that died
[38:52.880 --> 38:58.080]  they go to the bathroom and they kill themselves and the new world order dances
[38:58.080 --> 39:03.800]  and pleasure you realize the mega evil we're dealing with here and now they're
[39:03.800 --> 39:07.120]  teaching them to have abortions and saying mommy and daddy don't know here's
[39:07.120 --> 39:12.080]  your money have the abortion folks if you went to a 16 year old girl and you
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.960]  were 19 years old they would charge you a statutory rape and probably should you
[39:16.960 --> 39:20.000]  were 18 she was 16 you know it starts becoming borderline in my mind but the
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.840]  point is older guys shouldn't be praying on young women who really aren't
[39:22.840 --> 39:29.400]  women yet in some cases and but but obviously if you're 20 and you go after
[39:29.400 --> 39:33.360]  an 11 year old that's child molestation you should get 50 years in prison if
[39:33.360 --> 39:36.840]  you're 20 you go after a five year old you should be executed but the whole
[39:36.840 --> 39:40.840]  point here is that the state comes in and goes we're gonna teach you to have
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.320]  abortions we're gonna let you have inoculations you have free will we
[39:45.320 --> 39:50.200]  passed a law saying the age of consent is lowered this is pervert government
[39:50.200 --> 39:54.160]  coming in and getting in with your kids teaching them how to kill themselves
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.480]  children committing suicide under the age of 16 if you go to the statistics was
[39:59.480 --> 40:05.000]  unheard of in this country last time I checked there are people under 12 killing
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.560]  themselves by the tens of thousands every year and it's the same nationwide
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.520]  and worldwide they are doing this and see this is all my brain works I've got
[40:15.520 --> 40:18.840]  all this incredibly important news but then bound goes hey this is in your
[40:18.840 --> 40:23.920]  stack why didn't you cover this he's got a daughter he shook up by it the state
[40:23.920 --> 40:30.480]  comes to your five-year-old daughter how's your daughter five six five I got
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.840]  a five-year-old daughter and imagine they come to me tell him a story of a
[40:34.840 --> 40:37.400]  little girl that committed suicide but since a five-year-old doesn't know
[40:37.400 --> 40:45.000]  doesn't know how to go hang themselves in Belgium yet they're not eleven they
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.440]  tell him if you decide and sign the paper honey we're gonna make you go to
[40:50.440 --> 40:58.120]  sleep you'll never wake up and this is seen as a right the vampire imagine
[40:58.120 --> 41:02.000]  Nosferatu came to a five-year-old's bed the you know the devil incarnate
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.680]  Dracula and told a little girl it's your choice if you want me to suck your
[41:07.680 --> 41:14.600]  blood and kill you and then you'll be undead is he a hero well yeah in the
[41:14.600 --> 41:18.320]  culture he is a hero see death and zombies and destruction this is a
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.800]  beautiful sacrament all these little girls killing themselves this is this
[41:22.800 --> 41:33.280]  is lusciously loving and see I'm the bad man I am the bad man I am the bad man I
[41:33.280 --> 41:38.280]  don't want your eleven-year-old daughter to go to public school in
[41:38.280 --> 41:41.760]  California where she'll be preyed upon by guys that have flunked four grades and
[41:41.760 --> 41:46.120]  basically it's rape and then when they get her pregnant you'll say well it's
[41:46.120 --> 41:50.560]  right we need to kill the kid now that's another crime on top of it but the
[41:50.560 --> 41:53.240]  point is the parents even if you believe in abortion should be involved in it
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.040]  no no no now the state can we keep that NBC lady in the promo saying your kids
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.440]  don't belong to you this is the type of evil we're dealing with and they're not
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.440]  gonna stop and now it's mainstream news and there's a debate well is it good
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.160]  first it's oh it's sick kids it's old people lower-cost now it's no if you
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.600]  just want to kill yourself you should have that right and then now it's well
[42:13.600 --> 42:19.800]  if you are a kid you deserve that right listen folks if you want to kill
[42:19.800 --> 42:22.600]  yourself and you're an adult you know how to do it we don't need the state
[42:22.600 --> 42:25.800]  involved in that just like the state shouldn't be involved in marriage you
[42:25.800 --> 42:31.560]  want to get married get married there's an article right there Canada has death
[42:31.560 --> 42:40.280]  panels it's out of slate and there you know reporting on it of course we have
[42:40.280 --> 42:46.560]  death panels here now remember my dad coming to me about it three years ago
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.480]  and he said son this I heard dr. Blalock on your show breaking down I went and
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.600]  read the key areas of legislation he was is true yes and they're now coming to us
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.520]  through the state getting ready for Obamacare saying that it's all right
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.800]  if these medical companies just sell out to the big ones they'll all be exempt
[43:03.800 --> 43:06.560]  and it's pure profits but all the small and regionals that actually bring
[43:06.560 --> 43:09.560]  competition they're gonna be shut down but it's okay if we just join with the
[43:09.560 --> 43:13.960]  system and it's it's written to shut down all the competition and jack up
[43:13.960 --> 43:17.920]  prices and protect the big HMOs and insurance companies because I can't
[43:17.920 --> 43:20.080]  believe they're gonna get away with this and of course since then it's gotten
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.520]  much worse but you have to understand folks
[43:24.520 --> 43:28.720]  Obama will leave office at the end of this and all the police state will be in
[43:28.720 --> 43:34.200]  place and all this will be in place and they would have passed a few riders to
[43:34.200 --> 43:38.960]  you know claim they fixed Obamacare it Obamacare is working great just like the
[43:38.960 --> 43:44.200]  drug war triple the heroin use double the cocaine use methamphetamine use I
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.920]  saw some numbers like eight times what it was in the 70s the prison population is
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.640]  the biggest in the world it's everywhere they've got shows glorifying it to teach
[43:53.640 --> 43:59.280]  you it's cool to use I mean we are under devastating military attack and I don't
[43:59.280 --> 44:05.200]  just say that this is the Pentagon has been running psyops for 60 years
[44:05.200 --> 44:09.520]  domestically when it was the Department of War before the Pentagon
[44:09.520 --> 44:14.080]  Edward Bernays was running it and had the declassified mission we wrote a book
[44:14.080 --> 44:17.400]  about it in the 50s when it was declassified about how they were to
[44:17.400 --> 44:22.280]  destroy the family and break us down for assimilation into a brave new world
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.320]  and Huxley of course gave a speech and wrote another book brave new world
[44:26.320 --> 44:30.000]  revisited explaining that this was actually a battle plan and his brother
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.280]  headed up UNESCO now taking over all major heritage sites in the United
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.240]  States and putting them under UN control and if you criticize that because
[44:38.240 --> 44:42.800]  you're informed to know the entire history of it the those that are ignorant
[44:42.800 --> 44:48.640]  laugh at you as they politically and economically and spiritually burn in
[44:48.640 --> 44:54.480]  front of you and I'm burning with them our country is burning down our health
[44:54.480 --> 44:58.400]  is burning down our future is burning down we are being leveraged into debt
[44:58.400 --> 45:03.880]  that the Weimar Republic didn't even see in Germany pre-Hitlary in Germany it on
[45:03.880 --> 45:11.760]  every historical chart it is red level flying pig crazy
[45:11.760 --> 45:18.600]  by the way it tripled on average suicides from a from an unknown did didn't
[45:18.600 --> 45:24.280]  even exist right under 16 with a suicide education in 1990 since then it rolled
[45:24.280 --> 45:32.640]  out and the last time I checked it had more than tripled that number and now
[45:32.640 --> 45:36.720]  it's quote an epidemic so they have whole auditoriums about don't commit
[45:36.720 --> 45:40.480]  suicide go see your psychiatrist your psychologist here's the school people
[45:40.480 --> 45:45.600]  and then they push drugs on you that are on record to make you commit suicide at
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.560]  a 14 times higher rate that was the Eli Lilly suppressed study 1980 and they
[45:51.560 --> 45:56.920]  finally got approval 1981 on Prozac which is just a fluoride based chemical
[45:56.920 --> 46:02.920]  weapon and as folks figure out that's killing them we go we have a new one
[46:02.920 --> 46:06.680]  that's basically the same drug over and over again just like with Obama care
[46:06.680 --> 46:09.920]  okay we're gonna fix it that'll make it worse okay we'll fix it again that'll
[46:09.920 --> 46:11.800]  make it worse okay we'll fix it again that'll make it worse haven't you
[46:11.800 --> 46:16.400]  figured out let's say you had three kids I'll use this analogy again and one of
[46:16.400 --> 46:23.680]  them got picked up by a perv creeper van you know like the van from Scooby-Doo
[46:23.680 --> 46:28.320]  what do you call that the mystery machine the mystery machine with some
[46:28.320 --> 46:31.440]  methad devil worshipper already grabbed your three-year-old out of the
[46:31.440 --> 46:37.400]  backyard so your and your kid was found dead in a ditch a month later let's
[46:37.400 --> 46:40.840]  let's just give you the image with maggots crawling out of their eye
[46:40.840 --> 46:45.960]  sockets that's that's evil right there okay well you just decided well maybe
[46:45.960 --> 46:49.160]  didn't work that time you wait for the creeper van to come back and you give
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.080]  me a four-year-old kill that one now you got a ten-year-old general says no I
[46:53.080 --> 46:55.360]  don't want to get the creeper van kids didn't come back you know I'm like the
[46:55.360 --> 46:58.560]  ten-year-old I you know I'm the emperor's new clothes the emperor is not
[46:58.560 --> 47:01.520]  wearing a clothes folks I'm like I don't want to get the creeper van homeland
[47:01.520 --> 47:05.040]  security black uniforms checkpoints and I say spying government narcotics
[47:05.040 --> 47:07.960]  trafficking red level red level the people running our country when they
[47:07.960 --> 47:11.760]  have a country hostage start massacring everybody red level red level
[47:11.760 --> 47:15.720]  our government oversaw Pol Pot red level red level we're in danger we're in
[47:15.720 --> 47:20.000]  danger they're running al-qaeda red level red level emergency I'm doing
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.760]  trying to sit here and warn you people ask why I'm still alive if they kill me
[47:25.760 --> 47:31.800]  then it makes me a martyr it makes me a sage in the in the archetypal view and
[47:31.800 --> 47:36.840]  everyone listens to what I had to say so they assassinate my name instead you
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.040]  understand that ladies and gentlemen of course I don't care if they kill me I
[47:41.040 --> 47:46.800]  have no fear because all I fear is not fighting these people and letting them
[47:46.800 --> 47:54.360]  just run on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
[47:54.360 --> 48:00.600]  on having their way with free humanity over and over and over and over and over
[48:00.600 --> 48:03.440]  and over again
[48:06.080 --> 48:09.440]  let's get the guest on at 20 after we'll keep 20 minutes the next hour they
[48:09.440 --> 48:12.720]  can do it if they can't we'll just move into another day I've got to get to these
[48:12.720 --> 48:15.920]  calls and cover news like I said I did it's a good guest I want to get them on
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.360]  but I need to go to the calls if I said I would I know I'm right it's so much
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.160]  more horrible than words there's so many crimes so much evil so much they're
[48:25.160 --> 48:28.920]  doing so much connection so much manifest scientific rollout and all
[48:28.920 --> 48:32.960]  their own white papers admitting what I reverse engineer their operations and
[48:32.960 --> 48:35.520]  then read their white papers later and it's word for word what I've said on
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.200]  air but from their perspective I mean I literally have studied these people so
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.720]  long and so much I know more than most of their top people do and I realize
[48:44.720 --> 48:49.040]  where this plan is going and it's so horrible they're going to use every evil
[48:49.040 --> 48:55.720]  person every evil vice every evil control freak to man their takeover and then
[48:55.720 --> 49:00.400]  they believe they're going to virtuously expunge the earth of 99 plus
[49:00.400 --> 49:04.920]  percent of us they tell their minions 90% and other minions 80% I think they'll
[49:04.920 --> 49:08.200]  be part of the those that get to live and be part of it that's all the big
[49:08.200 --> 49:11.720]  secret for the 20 academic percent who will say of course we're gonna kill
[49:11.720 --> 49:15.240]  everybody there's too many you're like but my sombrero is racist they go well
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.080]  that's just to control you so we socially put ourselves in the moral
[49:18.080 --> 49:22.640]  high ground so your actual military operative yes we are and you are foolish
[49:22.640 --> 49:27.720]  to have not joined us but they plan to kill you too well you're just on a
[49:27.720 --> 49:30.160]  power trip about this you just think you're part of the establishment of
[49:30.160 --> 49:33.960]  humanity and then they're always like I don't want to talk to you anymore see
[49:33.960 --> 49:37.480]  because then the little power trips over once I point out to them okay even if
[49:37.480 --> 49:40.640]  you're just a psychopath control freak or whatever or get off on the power trip
[49:40.640 --> 49:43.680]  of this plan and thinking you're part of it because you've been led in at a
[49:43.680 --> 49:53.160]  lower level to some of it this is targeting everybody and they just don't
[49:53.160 --> 49:57.480]  get it and they go look at the problems of population and blah blah blah and
[49:57.480 --> 50:04.040]  ecological disasters and I'm like guess but you don't wreck humanity so that so
[50:04.040 --> 50:07.560]  that it can then be more easily exterminated and of course the globalists
[50:07.560 --> 50:11.200]  have meetings and it leaks that they're panicking the scourge contagions out of
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.160]  control that's what we're called we've got to limit it and it's mutating and
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.000]  resisting the program isn't working get the AI computers and oh my god we've
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.240]  got to save the earth and you know they have the Rockefeller University meetings
[50:22.240 --> 50:25.320]  and Oprah's there and they sit around with the Rockefellers and Rothschild's
[50:25.320 --> 50:28.960]  this all comes out and they discuss we've got to accelerate the program but if we
[50:28.960 --> 50:32.560]  continue to accelerate they will actually become aware of it we've got to have a

[54:30.400 --> 54:35.880]  the mainstream media the dinosaur media the dying media calls conspiracy
[54:35.880 --> 54:39.400]  theories very important look at the study showing those that call themselves
[54:39.400 --> 54:42.920]  conspiracy theorists on average it shows in major studies are actually more
[54:42.920 --> 54:46.480]  accurate more informed and just common sense they call the founding fathers
[54:46.480 --> 54:49.280]  conspiracy theorists saying you don't want a big giant government that takes
[54:49.280 --> 54:52.480]  your guns they'll do that to enslave you that's just the case in every point in
[54:52.480 --> 54:57.560]  history just absolute common sense fact it'd be like telling a fish don't come
[54:57.560 --> 55:00.960]  up and grab on a hook that's got a worm on it I mean there's a person up there
[55:00.960 --> 55:04.960]  that's gonna grab you and take you away so you can just tell the fish it's a
[55:04.960 --> 55:08.080]  conspiracy theory bite the hook they go okay

[55:19.240 --> 55:21.960]  literally telling you don't have instincts don't be common sense don't
[55:21.960 --> 55:28.120]  question that's a conspiracy theory while you can go look up death education
[55:28.120 --> 55:33.600]  since 1990 of the Department of Education massively increasing suicides in
[55:33.600 --> 55:38.200]  this country of small children and now under the new rights in Europe they're
[55:38.200 --> 55:43.560]  trying to pass here children as young as five years old can decide to kill
[55:43.560 --> 55:48.840]  themselves oh sorry mom and dad we convinced your five-year-old that they
[55:48.840 --> 55:52.400]  want to die they're gonna go to a facility they're gonna be given lethal
[55:52.400 --> 56:00.320]  injection and then the parents go well that's liberal and then they always
[56:00.320 --> 56:06.640]  sell it like oh it's for case they're sick and people won't let them no no it's
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.520]  all about killing granny it's all about getting rid of people and you're all
[56:10.520 --> 56:16.400]  going to find out you know here's the news no matter what happens to me this
[56:16.400 --> 56:21.640]  stuff's real my analysis is right on target because the globalists are all
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.520]  public it's like I've used this analogy I'll use it again it'd be like if I said
[56:26.520 --> 56:32.760]  money night football they have NFL games and then it was NFL games came on and
[56:32.760 --> 56:36.280]  somebody went man how do you know that you are so smart I'm like it's in the
[56:36.280 --> 56:43.040]  TV guide it's online or it's in this book that on this channel it's something
[56:43.040 --> 56:45.360]  such time who's playing they're like that's
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.600]  unbelievable but see if it's not knowledge they know even if you have the
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.480]  book like here's the book here's eco science where the White House science
[56:55.480 --> 57:00.800]  are says they put steroids in the water that is like no that in real I'm not
[57:00.800 --> 57:05.400]  gonna look at it please look at I yeah whatever you cook and I understand why
[57:05.400 --> 57:13.320]  they do that because they don't want to admit it and here's the deal I don't
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.760]  like the dumbed-down mass of people but I really don't like the globalists that
[57:17.760 --> 57:20.560]  have helped grease the skids towards this and let me tell you something folks
[57:20.560 --> 57:24.400]  society is degenerating faster I have never been more freaked out and
[57:24.400 --> 57:27.360]  concerned and I am now it is degenerating fast and this country's
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.680]  really in a depression but nobody's telling the minions that and so they're
[57:31.680 --> 57:34.320]  all freaking out because they think they're all failures and that everybody
[57:34.320 --> 57:38.120]  else's a success because they watch television and society is just going
[57:38.120 --> 57:42.960]  haywire right now and I know you know that and it's time to get on your knees
[57:42.960 --> 57:47.080]  folks to before God and ask for guidance that's only thing can hold me

[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.120]  have Russell Blaylock on I'm glad you mentioned them today because that's
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.240]  actually the question I had for you was the next time I remember him talking
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.440]  about the CPT codes of the health care system and maybe we were gonna get an
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.320]  update you know it's funny it's funny dr. Blaylock's number changed we tried to
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.160]  get him on a few weeks ago but it was funny I was just talking before you were
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.280]  on air about trying to get dr. Blaylock back on during I was during a break I
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.960]  was saying where's Blaylock and they were literally on him calling his wife's
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:08.560]  cell number that we just got via email as you went on air on screen so talk
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.760]  about is that synchronicity or serendipity synchronicity so so yeah
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:21.000]  we're gonna get Blaylock on who again it was the most accurate forecaster who
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.320]  actually read the entire 13,000 pages of writers he actually scanned over it and
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.760]  he just said this is going to wreck everything by design the website's not
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.880]  gonna work it's not meant to work it's meant to wreck everything
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:41.020]  oh yeah but doesn't it just make you mad to watch him doing this to the
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.920]  country and you watch an Obama rally they all look at him like like like
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.800]  dogs that are begging for food or something just totally trusting totally
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:53.040]  loving like like children getting in a van with a killer I mean it's just it's
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:57.360]  knowing it's pure evil you know you're looking at the devil you know you're
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.560]  looking at the betrayer the destroyer and you can't help these people they're
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.800]  never gonna listen they're not they don't want to be helped it's so sad man go
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.760]  ahead but people are waking up people have we're deceived by them at first now
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.480]  people are looking they're listening to people like you they're understanding
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.040]  and they're waking up and where I'm from they're waking up there's no their
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.080]  favorite was going on and we are moving forward and we're just we're following
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.120]  leaders like you Alex oh god bless your brother I'm no leader I'm just somebody
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.080]  fighting back I've just got the basic instinct to not want to be a slave let's
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:37.840]  go to the caller Mary in Washington welcome yes hi Alex hi hi I'm Alex I
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.680]  wondered if you'd be kind enough to let me finish my thought before you jump in
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.600]  I'm a little bit nervous but I've been talking about this for years I think
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.800]  that overpopulation just causes tremendous amount of suffering especially
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:59.640]  amongst children people who have children who have made no plan to care
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.240]  for them I'll make our putting their children in jeopardy those are the
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.520]  children that are flying flying up at sex plays or in the factories that make
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.480]  your iPad excuse me I don't even know I won't you know with the suit with the
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.120]  suicide net I tell you what I'm gonna come back to you Mary I gotta go break
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.400]  don't hang up and I'm gonna come back at listen I get that in some areas is
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.440]  overpopulation but it's the way the economy's been designed if you read the
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.880]  the population commission report from 49 I'm gonna come back and let you make
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.720]  your point that I'll counter on that the issue is even if you think the poor
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.200]  people need to be exterminated are you gonna make that decision it's like in
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:44.240]  the new Superman man of steel when he's talking to Zod Cal-El or the Superman's
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.120]  dad he says we've got to exterminate the you know the degenerate bloodlines and
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.160]  Superman's dad who's the scientist goes who's gonna decide Zod you I mean you're
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.040]  gonna kill these poor kids you're gonna take them and euthanize them and then
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.800]  use their body for fertilizers
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.180]  financial experts are certain that within 12 to 36 months the American
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:07.960]  economy will collapse pushing most Americans into terrifying poverty like
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.600]  third-world slums facing this unstoppable horror and knowing so many are
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.880]  unprepared a group of military bats engineers survival experts and a former
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.400]  FDIC bank inspector pooled their knowledge and experience to create
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.600]  locusts on the horizon.com locusts on the horizon is a book over 1,100 pages in

[01:07:55.280 --> 01:08:10.240]  my patriot supply today big brother mainstream media government coverups you
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:17.760]  want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:31.480]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones local KXAN 590 news radio here in Austin
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.640]  reported a lot in the last few months that most people parking at the Austin
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:40.240]  Berkshire Airport long-term short-term it doesn't matter get their cars broken
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.320]  into now by the government they leave a little note saying we've searched your
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.920]  car without a warrant and now as I predicted years ago they want to move
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.640]  the checkpoints out to the entrance to the airport because a bomber might attack
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.720]  and then it'll be to the highway and then everywhere to a random cornfield
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.880]  behind your house or to your home because you know we don't know you don't
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.680]  have dead bodies in your basement but you can't go to government and do that
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:06.360]  why that's national security why even getting around an NSA building will
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.120]  threaten to arrest you if you even dare come and ask us a question you're a
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.800]  slave and then meanwhile there's been some type of shooting at LAX several
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.480]  people been injured reportedly someone got a gun through security and then
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:25.000]  shot people this is after last week they were calling for big x-ray scanners
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.640]  outside the airports searching everyone and looking through your cars and now
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.480]  they have SWAT teams running around the parking lots grandstanding shutting off
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:38.040]  highways with police running around with their machine guns so mass shootings
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.040]  are down in general school shootings are up slightly statistic with their
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.600]  still very rare overall gun crime down 49% FBI's on numbers but the average
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.840]  American thinks because of the conditioning we're in an epidemic of
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.480]  shootings because the media does this but the good news is there's a report
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:59.840]  out today CNN has a record low in its history ratings plunging and the
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.120]  approval ratings of all the establishment folks the politicians are
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.440]  plunging as well there it is full body scan technology developing into roving
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.280]  street vans in good old America but the borders wide open and deportations are
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.840]  at record low any idea how bad it is for you to go through a scanner that shoots
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.240]  through your body and through the metal I've had radiologist on who said that
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:29.280]  it's about a hundred times stronger than a chest x-ray I mean boy you can just
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.080]  euthanize this right there now we have a caller Mary who got cut off at the last
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.400]  break told her to recap what she was saying I was talking about Belgium and
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.040]  the Netherlands and others saying oh for the earth that's what they're
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.520]  teaching people if your child wants to commit suicides for any reason there's
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.160]  no parental rights that can kill themselves just like parental rights
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.120]  they're getting rid of here saying you're kicking out an abortion when
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.280]  they're 10 or 11 or get inoculations in California without parental consent this
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.720]  is the state coming in being the child molesters they are of their minds their
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.480]  future their health parents can't pack lunches and if we want to convince your
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.440]  kid to commit suicide they will for the earth and now that's not even big news
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.760]  it's an NBC news are like maybe it is good you'll kill yourself parents you
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.000]  don't have a right and we're gonna teach your kids in government schools to
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.320]  kill themselves just like ABC News has had to admit years ago with death
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.840]  education massively increased suicides yeah teaching kids how to commit
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.560]  suicide in quote prevention make some commit suicide because it's teaching them
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.720]  about to do it and introducing the idea they know that as social engineers but
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:37.200]  Mary you were I mean repeat what you said earlier it was it was a pretty heavy
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.520]  because you know the average real progressive liberal you will admit
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.520]  they'll say well there's too many people so we've got a reduced population but
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.160]  if you like a sombrero when you go to Mexico to hang on your wall you're
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.400]  racist or if you have a brown bag you're racist or a London Telegraph man ban
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.000]  from Facebook for liking faggots that's the name of a fried meatball dish that
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.880]  I get when I'm in England says that in the restaurants that's the name it means
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:05.480]  burned meat but because somebody took that name well just like Hallmark won't
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:12.000]  say deck the halls anymore with a gay apparel happy apparel because and if
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.920]  they now say dad's a dirty word in France and in many areas the US it's bad
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.640]  bad because they say I'm offended by dad my father mother it's bad that's mind
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:26.920]  control but let's go back to her to have the floor Mary from Washington tell us
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.120]  repeat what you said and continue well first of all I didn't say anything about
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.400]  telling people just a coincidence that you happen to be you have to be talking
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.640]  about that I got on the phone I called that just after 9 o'clock and waited an
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.280]  hour I'm just talking about the fact I mean I was one of those children those
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.240]  children who are vulnerable my father tried to pet me off I mean my mom repeat
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.400]  repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat what you said first so as congruent with what
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.520]  you're saying now I'm just saying people I'm not talking about abortion or
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.520]  killing people I'm just talking about people being more cautious or careful
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.800]  more thoughtful about having children they have children that they have no
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.000]  chance of taking care of they don't have the means to do it they wound up
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.400]  joining the military and traveling around the world killing other people's
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.440]  children in order to support their own or they cut down the entire rainforest
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.240]  or they do whatever they take jobs in the TSA where they've got their hands
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.880]  down their pants so they can go home and feed there like you know cretin you
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.080]  know be with my kids you know these people will do anything they won't ask
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.400]  any questions they can't be discerning any more they're desperate in this part
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.320]  of the I agree the giant no no that's what they leave done they've actually
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.200]  incentivized with welfare giant dumb down masses to be the enforcers over the
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.080]  producers I agree but then they know that it's going to get the working class to
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.560]  finally agree with exterminating these people in the final equation and what a
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:52.640]  diabolical plan people people overwhelmed they're too overwhelmed by
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.560]  poverty to address the corruption and the corporations depend on this they
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.680]  depend on poverty I mean look at the Walmart the that's why they want to
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.240]  flood the US with desperate third-world populations and their own admissions to
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.840]  destroy the wages just like Obamacare was meant to kick half the population down
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.120]  to part-time and then go on welfare yeah no it's a total takeover why why
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.040]  hasn't the subject been addressed I mean this horse is the one let out of the bar
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.320]  and decades ago it should have been addressed the fact that taxpayers pay
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.200]  for these kids on welfare and my Irish Catholic mother should have it and
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.420]  shouldn't have had one so nothing to do with race the fact that these people have
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:32.520]  been you know not have not been at least discouraged but the conversation
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.120]  hasn't even been had do you understand what my judge did and in
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.920]  idiocracy that's a great work of history basically put in satire in the
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:46.600]  future future of satire you've got the football player who has an IQ about 75
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.600]  who has all the cheerleaders and he says I'm gonna have babies with all of you he
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.640]  says something else and you've got the two yuppies that have high IQs who decide
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.640]  not to have kids that's the real issue here and the IQ is plunging but what I'm
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:04.440]  saying is as you said the elite is also trying to dumb down the mass as fast as
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:10.920]  they can while creating an army of slugs out of the underclass to then wage
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.080]  parasitic war on the producers which which then forces producers to join the
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.280]  technocrats out of survival and the technocrats also intend to take us out
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.680]  so I'm saying how do you get out of this when the globalists that have like 200
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.360]  IQs but are very cold have done this that's why they've told me they've said
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:33.720]  you know in off-record discussions you should really join us we're you know this
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:39.200]  is your only hope and I just cannot join something this evil I don't know what
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:47.680]  you do I mean what do you do Alex yes I'm Alex I'm well first of all like if
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.800]  I'm not mistaken the middle class was created by the bubonic plague and that
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:56.440]  I just say that to make the point that that's for the of labor increases
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.520]  wages and now people are breeding recklessly essentially providing the
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.560]  materials for falling at green and we're just being charmed up in the machine
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.000]  people are being used I've been meaning to have this real discussion with folks
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.280]  and really be honest about it but it's true but I indict the globalist because
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.920]  in their own admissions they are after the smartest and best people to destroy
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.280]  us and so they're not trying to make a better Krypton like Zod said he was
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.880]  wanting to do to create that analogy they want to ensure the degenerate blood
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.160]  line rules everything and they've decided that humans are trash period and
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.720]  they're going to merge with machines and go to Alpha Centuries so I don't know
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.160]  what you do when the general public doesn't understand there's a breakaway
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.320]  civilization that's already made the decision to bring in world government to
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.080]  then force out and exterminate everybody and your only hope is to basically
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.600]  join Elysium that's what it is a breakaway civilization but here on the
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.720]  earth under government and corporate reservations and then the upheas all they
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.960]  can do is laugh at me and then try to do whatever they can to join the sub
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.120]  establishment just so they can feel powerful I don't know what you do I
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:11.480]  appreciate your call very very serious thoughts there on air makes me sick let's
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.880]  talk to Larry in Texas Larry are on the air how you doing mr. Alex Jones I'm
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.120]  doing all right okay I was calling in and tell you I don't really hear anybody
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.280]  talking about early American history concerning like Charles Thompson in a
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.360]  row he played in establishing a US government with his ties with Native
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:35.480]  Americans and then my second one and I get off the phone most black people
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.640]  right now have become Democrats but at the slavery Republicans help black
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.640]  open up the first schools in the South and not only that they didn't really
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.920]  become Democrats until the new deal was passed because that's what got black
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.480]  people from moving for themselves to get complacent on the system and now
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.040]  that's right statistically before the the new deal and the great leap forward I
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:04.880]  call it that it was the great society of LBJ black folks were more independent
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:11.040]  and on average in big cities had more wealth than white people on average and
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.400]  that's why they did that and and sold it is a great thing so you go from 10%
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:20.080]  illegitimacy to 90 plus percent illegitimacy in just two generations and
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.520]  now that's the same plan they've done to black folks is being deployed against
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:29.880]  everybody on the way on the way I visualized it being stopped is with
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:34.320]  unity because it's it's a fight out there for everybody it's not just a one-man
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.960]  thing because at the end of the day if they went over here they can win
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:43.000]  everywhere else well that's right and and and you know that's really the answer
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.480]  is independence and and the the royal commission on population put out in 49
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.600]  said if we industrialize the third world they would stop having children don't
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.240]  have 1.3 children on average and then we could fix all the problems but we
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:00.360]  don't want to do that we're going to use giant population blooms as a weapon
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.920]  against the first world to lower it down so we can control and dominate
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.040]  everybody and then we'll just kill everybody and deal with it down the
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.120]  line but the British Empire hasn't been able to dominate everything yet along
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.640]  with the US Empire so we'll just go ahead and do this and then deal with it
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.280]  later so the very people claiming they're dumping us down and poisoning us
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.600]  to reduce our population are the very ones that helped engineer it so do you
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.680]  see how they fund both sides of it they always do they run Al Qaeda they fund it
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.960]  then they fund the fighting of it and so we can't fly to Africa and being like
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.600]  big golden skyscrapers and check out all the cool real estate we can't go into
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.720]  Mexico and it'd be a great society and great people and we're soon gonna be
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.400]  like those places total hell holes is they're gonna wreck everything hurt us
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.280]  into compact cities while they live in big armored compounds on the countryside
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:52.920]  and get live extension technology I mean that's it that's their official plan
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.760]  how horrible is that and they have helped engineer all this environmental
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.280]  degradation and they don't care about leaking reactors

[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.720]  reported by Fox News a TSA worker was shot at LAX notice these shootings
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:21.560]  always happen in gun-free areas where you go through all this security and
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:26.240]  many times are very suspicious but we'll see what happened here you never know
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.320]  if it was a misfire they'll probably say it was on purpose I mean we don't know
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.040]  we're just speculating but known liars we can't just believe whatever they say
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.480]  we are seeing some interesting anomalies we're looking into right now but
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.240]  should we question a government that's known for lying and a power structure
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.720]  known for lying even when the truth would serve them better well if you do
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.600]  question known liars your neighbor or anyone else let's say your wife's been
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.080]  caught cheating on you 50 times and catch her in bed with another man if she
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.280]  says I didn't and then you say I don't believe you she just says you're a
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.000]  conspiracy terrorist and she's won the argument and riding shotgun with us this
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.120]  hour a little bit of the next if he wants to we'll cover a bunch of news and
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:08.200]  take calls and get his take on it is Lance to Haven Smith he's a professor
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:11.560]  and he's written a book that's a great cover I haven't read it yet but I can't
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:18.840]  wait to it's conspiracy theory in America and I've seen some of the studies
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:23.200]  in the news that it's based on study conspiracy theorists are saying
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.800]  government doops are crazy in these studies so I'll look at that with him
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.120]  today and then just just go over some of this just just in 15 years ago I was
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.800]  a conspiracy theorist saying they had whole floors of telecoms with NSA hubs
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.320]  in them of course that was in the telecommunications act the funding of
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:47.960]  it and I had whistleblowers on but their answer was just say oh that's the
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.000]  crazy guy you know that's illegal we don't do that now we know of course they
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.480]  were and it's the same thing over and over again they call me a conspiracy
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.160]  theorist saying that they're getting a World Heritage site UN things of the
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.800]  Alamo which does let them bring in easement land control just like when
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.640]  you get special designations for you know your private property or whatever
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:09.240]  and it's a fact Congress has admitted that well they just call it a conspiracy
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.480]  theory and say the UN is not involved at all that's a lot of their viewers they
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.520]  played that clip from local news yesterday and it doesn't matter so Lance
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.800]  Dehaven Smith joins us we appreciate him coming on to Haven-Smith.com is his
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.800]  website and he's the school of public administration policy at Florida State
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.600]  University former president of the Florida Political Science Association not
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.280]  gonna go over his whole bio here but he's got peer-reviewed journals Dehaven
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.440]  Smith coined the term state crimes against democracy to name the type of
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.400]  crime the conspiracy theory labeled dangerous for us speaking well I think
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:47.120]  that's outrageous anybody that thinks government ever does anything wrong or
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.440]  corporations is obviously quite mad I would you like to apologize sir for your
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.160]  heresy here on air up front I understand what you're saying it's it's really
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:04.920]  quite amazing that this attitude has taken hold in the United States we're
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:11.600]  a country with a long history of being skeptical and suspicious and worried
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:18.200]  about conspiracies against the people's liberties and interests and to suddenly
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.960]  and this happens really basically after World War two we have this conspiracy
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:30.160]  theory label that smears anybody who raises any suspicions about elite
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:36.000]  political criminality when the history books all it is is elite political
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  criminality the few times they're not total criminals or the rare jewels that's
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:47.640]  exactly right there's a famous historian in the United States he is no longer
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:54.960]  alive Charles Beard who is the only historian to be elected president of
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.800]  both the American Historical Society and the American Political Science
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:06.920]  Association and he basically said well what history is is uncovering
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:12.920]  conspiracies that that was the key to it and he was well known in the early
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:20.240]  1900s because he had argued that the American Constitution basically protected
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.000]  the interest of the people who had written it and that in effect they had
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.680]  conspired to develop a government that served their interests he had a kid he
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:39.280]  had a theory about World War two he said that President Roosevelt knew that
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.720]  Pearl Harbor was going to happen knew when it was going to happen and failed
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.720]  to warn the military commanders in this in the Pacific because he wanted to
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:56.600]  mobilize American outrage to enter World War two this was in the book was a
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.560]  bestseller for three months you know it received a lot of notoriety but it's
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.840]  basically been airbrushed out of American history if you go and look in the
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.480]  American Political Science Review it is mentioned one time when the book first
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.480]  came out it's never mentioned again and this was the most famous person at the
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.720]  time putting this book out and I am familiar with the book but we're about
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.880]  to go to break long statement coming up I'm gonna give you the floor to break
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:26.320]  down from your historical scientific you know forensic research what we really
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:32.040]  are facing what this system of denial of rational concern and thought well how
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.960]  you quantify it because really think about it folks American spirit for all
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.800]  our problems we were exceptional in that we were the most untrusting of the
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.800]  power structure so we became the most wealthy because we weren't being
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:48.000]  screwed as much now we're becoming slaves again because we were taught not to

[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:56.560]  theories I know that Monsanto even in an issue that I covered on air more than
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.640]  10 years ago of National Geographic admitted their plan was to basically
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.040]  make everything GMO and patented so that you had to go to them to get seeds and
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.360]  that plants didn't produce seeds anymore they would literally engineer and own
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.720]  the world that way a conquest not and I'm paraphrasing what they said but they're
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.720]  public about this and you could see Archer Daniels Midland and other GMO
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.280]  companies you know doing the same thing and then the Rockefeller Foundation with
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.400]  the UN going back about six years ago funded all over the world more than 14
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.040]  I think last time I said it was 16 I'm showing you a daily mail article today
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:37.000]  building armored doomsday seed vaults of original seeds that aren't GMO and
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.080]  Monsanto's even involved funding this so they plan to take over with their stuff
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:46.520]  and then I guess later like moon raker or something repopulate the earth with
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.960]  the stuff that's original in case they need to when I mentioned stuff like this
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.400]  they've had national media say Jones is crazy and says the elites have secret
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.480]  seed vaults I mean that's their answer to it's almost like intellectual laziness
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.000]  or not almost where it's beyond just the state saying don't criticize this or
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.400]  don't look into us that doesn't exist the opposite of the Americana system it's
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:16.760]  more than that it's the individual has embraced it after World War two and
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.280]  we're the good guys we can do no wrong because it's a cop out it's a reason to
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.800]  not worry about anything and just be a spectator now the reason I bring this
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:29.840]  up is just in case we come a cropper that's the headline the doomsday vault
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.080]  that keeps seeds for every type of agriculture mankind relies upon should a
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:38.240]  disaster ever wipe them out and then it goes through they have them for animals
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:43.960]  plants and animals and other systems but the point is that's why we promote
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.600]  getting non-gmo non-hybrid open pollinated seeds in the info or store
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.880]  seed area the widest selection of these anywhere at the lowest price info or
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.880]  store.com so you can give this holiday season coming up folks high quality
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:04.680]  seeds some to save they save for a hundred years well they broke into the
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.480]  Egyptian burial chambers of the pharaohs and we're able to plant papyrus
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.160]  from 3,000 years ago but the point is that these last for a long time plant
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.840]  some save some it's a great family thing to do it's just an example of how they
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.680]  don't want us to grow our own food they don't want us to be off the grid they
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.880]  want us dependent they want us on welfare and they admit in the cloud and
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:28.800]  pivot strategy it's not my opinion this is about domestication domination
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:33.000]  control so again everything in info or store.com is about getting involved
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.840]  getting informed getting self-sufficient and a great way to start is with high
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:40.680]  quality seeds we've got about ten different companies in there all the
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:44.960]  best at the lowest prices info or store.com in the info or seed center or
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.880]  call toll free they can answer your questions and send you a catalog if you
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:56.400]  like 888-253-3139 and we just so happen to have just gotten more of this in the
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:01.080]  survival shield atomic patented nasin iodine that I've been taking for over
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:05.920]  two months I've lost weight I feel great my thyroid health is amazing just as
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.320]  doctor group said this was the one thing we should roll out the enforce
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.360]  lifeline with is the survival shield that helps detoxify and block the stuff
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:21.040]  that's in the same area the periodic table the chlorine and the other halogens
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:26.520]  like fluoride so it's all available at info or life.com or info or store.com
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.560]  more of it is in and we have geared up production of it because it was a very
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:34.280]  small little laboratory it's been around for 40 years that did it for us and
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.400]  still made them loving little batches but we got a bigger batch in but it's
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.840]  probably going to be gone very quickly but we're shipping these out as fast as
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.520]  we can you want to get the survival shield and promote health and liberty in

[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.680]  but I've read the studies it's based on and the synopsis I will try to read it
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:03.640]  this weekend I'm not selling it everybody should get it and give it to
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:10.640]  skeptic friends at to haven-smith.com or amazon.com really impressive breakdown
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.240]  that I've scanned over in the book conspiracy theory in America discovering
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:19.280]  America and sir again you just had a few minutes the last segment I want to
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.160]  give you the floor now in this long segment if you were talking to the
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.400]  general public folks that weren't skeptical and really thinking and
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.200]  understand what's happening what would you say to the general public that
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:35.100]  that really wears their ignorance like a suit of armor and is proud almost the
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:39.440]  religion of ignorance is what I call it how would you try to reach out to them
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:47.080]  and wake them up to our collective peril. I would tell them to do what I did
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:56.200]  that woke me up I mean I was just a regular college professor I saw that the
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:01.560]  2000 election in Florida being stolen by the people who were responsible for
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.760]  administering the system and that shocked me and I was shocked that it was not
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:13.480]  investigated after the election and I was was shocked that it was just buried
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:20.720]  basically but the but once I was kind of shocked by that I did in it I did
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:28.080]  something I just simply wrote a list of all of the assassinations and defense
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:37.560]  failures and economic problems and bioterrorism attacks and faulty
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:45.360]  intelligence and I just made this list it was about the whole 15 or 20 of these
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:51.440]  crimes and there wasn't a name for these the founders had called them high
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:57.200]  crimes but with that has kind of dropped out I think it was it's a very good term
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:04.200]  but if you think about we have names for juvenile crime white collar crime hate
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:11.400]  crime and yet for these very serious grave crimes against the organizing
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.560]  principles of our democracy we don't have a name we call them conspiracy
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.840]  theories if you if you have a theory about what we don't have a name but so I
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:30.000]  did this list and I was shocked I had grown up when President Kennedy was
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.960]  killed and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and Robert Kennedy and George
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:44.680]  Wallace was attacked and Ronald Reagan was shocked I knew all this but I had
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:51.400]  never sat down and just looked at a list of them and once you do that you see
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:56.040]  that it's a very common occurrence that you have the assassinations you have
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.560]  these defense failures or provide provocations the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:12.360]  resolution 9-11 these you know inexplicable defense failures and you
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:18.360]  have the government cleaning up these events the limousine that President
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:23.680]  Kennedy was in was washed while it was still at Parkland Hospital the debris
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:30.040]  in 9-11 was cleaned up immediately and shipped to China I mean the agency
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:35.040]  responsible for investigating the collapse of the buildings in New York
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:43.040]  did not look for evidence of incendiaries and explosives I mean this is a
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:48.280]  malfeasance in government this is this should be a crime and we should we
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:53.520]  should bring these people into court and prosecute them for failure to do
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.920]  their job any the other thing that was shocking me so I looked at all these
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.600]  things I said well you know half the election since World War II have had a
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:08.360]  major problem and that includes the assassination of John Kennedy Robert
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:14.480]  Kennedy Martin Luther King the October surprise of 1968 with Nixon derail the
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:23.760]  peace talks with Vietnam the 1972 shooting of George Wallace the 1980 October
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:31.720]  surprise Iran Contra and the list goes on of course most recently 9-11 and the
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:38.600]  anthrax letter attacks one of the things that I urge people to do is not to look
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.320]  at these events one by one that's the conspiracy theory label tends to have
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.360]  you look at you know what's the good the theory of this crime and what's the
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:54.000]  theory of that crime and you need to look at them together to see the
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  connections I agree it is a it is a shadow government program and
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:05.840]  formulas being used by each successive group inhabiting those bureaucratic and
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:10.440]  corporate command bases that continue to repeat the same playbook and it's the
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.760]  same players throughout multiple events then passing the baton to their adjuncts
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.200]  and protogees when you study it it is a program of control and and and just to
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:25.120]  add professor for folks that just joined us here on air if you might have tuned
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:30.000]  in we're talking to Lance Dehaven Smith author of conspiracy theories in America
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.960]  he is a a professor of history and political science who's joining us
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.480]  breaking this down with us he's written many other books that have been a
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.320]  prominent successful as well but but he's just going over this but imagine we
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:49.160]  as he said we have crime juvenile delinquents we have we have shoplifting
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:52.560]  we have white-collar crime we have but when it's mega bankers stealing
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.200]  trillions well they don't go to jail that's just too big to fail when they
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.520]  create counterfeits by the trillions like people like Larry Summers and so
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:05.240]  they've created an idea where oh no the big people can't ever do anything wrong
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:11.360]  and so it's then the end the end really of accountability and you're asking for
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.360]  a name for it it's called criminal government you have some more
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:18.720]  sophisticated names it's called tyranny and unfortunately the reason Americans
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.800]  were so jealous of Liberty's Thomas Jefferson said we should be was because
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:26.800]  we knew history Liberty was incredibly rare in fact that that's a term you know
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.360]  this very rare jewel must be guarded as Jefferson said and even if you guard it
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.120]  and have a virtuous society you probably won't be able to keep it but if you
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.800]  say there's no such thing as corruption in high places which historically is the
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.280]  great plague government killed 262 million people in the 20th century alone
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:47.680]  according to a major study by the University of Hawaii and a professor we
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:51.040]  can't have him on but we'd like to have him on but he's hearing impaired so he
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:54.320]  said he would do an article for some time but and we've seen other numbers
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:00.200]  that are even higher non-military related deaths 262 million governments lining
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.000]  people up shooting them starving them but then we're told if you question big
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.360]  government or you question big corporations or you question unaccountable
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:12.440]  you're insane that doesn't exist go ahead professor sorry well and that's the
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.680]  thing the conspiracy theory label is applied very selectively by the
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:23.640]  political class they focus on the amateurs investigating the Kennedy
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.240]  assassination and ridicule them but then when we have real conspiracies like
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:34.080]  they're lying us into war in Iraq that costs hundreds of thousands if not
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.520]  millions of lives that is not viewed as a conspiracy theory and yet those are
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:43.560]  the one the conspiracy theories that are really dangerous it's the elite
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:50.960]  conspiracy theories the other thing I was going to say is the failure to look
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:56.280]  at these events as collected as together is different from how we would look at
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:01.000]  ordinary crimes if a guy married a wealthy woman and she fell in the bathtub
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.640]  and died we would be suspicious because it's an improbable event and he
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.920]  benefited if he married again and had another wife die under an accidental
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:16.600]  thing like that we would really be suspicious we'd investigate him we dig
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:21.400]  up the bodies we would you know control the crime scene we'd have all these
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:26.320]  syrenzy people in but when it comes to something like an assassination or a
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:33.640]  9-11 defense failure or an anthrax letter attack we destroy literally destroy
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:39.840]  the evidence so the 9-11 debris is shipped out the anthrax letter attacks
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:45.520]  there was an inventory of anthrax at Iowa University that was destroyed right
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:53.120]  after the anthrax letter attacks so part of what's going on is what what we need
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:58.600]  to do is apply ordinary forensic techniques and investigative techniques
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:03.800]  to these high crimes and we shouldn't you know we should bring these people in
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:09.280]  and interrogate them and tell the people at the bottom we'll let them get a
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:15.000]  lighter sentence if they'll confess about the higher-ups this is the way we
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.400]  handle ordinary crime if we did that with these state crimes with these
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.280]  government crimes we could solve them we wouldn't be sitting here 50 years after
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:31.040]  the Kennedy assassination wonder who did it the other thing about the
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:37.920]  conspiracy theory label is it's like they it forces us to who have these
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:43.600]  suspicions to be expected to have a complete full-blown theory we're supposed
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.440]  to solve the Kennedy assassination we're supposed to solve 9-11 and if we can't do
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:54.000]  that then our ideas are no good but the reality is we don't have subpoena power
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.520]  we don't have all these millions of dollars of forensic experts and
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:03.400]  techniques the people who are supposed to solve these crimes are the government
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.360]  now that's the problem the government is the criminal and the government is the
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.640]  investigator so we have this built-in conflict of interest and we have to
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.000]  figure out ways to deal with that and what the founders said was let's pit the
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.960]  elites against each other and that worked pretty well I mean we had a lot of
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:30.280]  investigations Aaron Burr was tried for for treason Andrew Jackson complained
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:36.280]  about the corrupt bargain and then was elected president four years later
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:41.520]  Abraham Lincoln complained that President Polk had lied us into the
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:47.160]  Mexican-American war so we had elites fighting with each other and checking
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:53.360]  each other and challenging each other until World War two and then what
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:49:00.480]  happened is the political class as a whole began to lock arms and defend
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:07.200]  itself as a group against suspicions in the mass and they were able to so well
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.360]  said professor Lee crystallize it they were able to totally flip the American
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:16.080]  culture of jealously guarding our liberties and separation of powers and
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:22.280]  now we're just seeing a real awakening to oh if we don't just just trust these
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:27.400]  people you know we might have a better quality of life and more justice and
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:32.600]  groveling to the power structure enslaves you because I do see to give
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:37.560]  folks some good news the beginnings of a real awakening of common sense but
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:43.480]  anybody that studied any period of history Byzantine Roman Babylonian
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:49.720]  Mesoamerican I don't care what culture it was Druidic all of those cultures
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.680]  that was constant Kings courts and subterfuge and conspiracies and
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:58.000]  manipulation look at business look at your own life I mean I imagine with
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.240]  other professors at your college you know there's little clicks and things in
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.960]  funding fights and you know all that but they're saying at the big level though
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:12.120]  that that doesn't exist I mean this is asinine on its face it really is and to
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:18.680]  me it's a shocking thing to see Americans accept all this one you know
[01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:24.800]  it's not like I say it's you know it's obscure and hard to solve but a lot of
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:31.840]  this is just so blatant I mean think about it president Kennedy is shot with
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:38.120]  a mediocre rifleman who gets all three lucky shots and hits him twice and the
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:42.960]  governor gets the wounds all over his body and they arrest a guy and they
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.200]  interrogate him for two days and they don't take notes and they don't record
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.080]  it and they march him out and kill him and then all the witnesses die that see
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:54.600]  all the government behind the grassy knoll stay there professor and we'll
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:58.880]  come right back the book is conspiracy theory in America free thinking in

[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.920]  against the country I got a big news blitz coming up after our guest leaves us
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:56.440]  in about 15 minutes Sheriff Richard Mack who was there when the sheriff was
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:02.240]  found not guilty of defending the Second Amendment he's going to be coming on the
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.480]  broadcast so we're gonna have get Sheriff's Mack take on that he was there
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.960]  and saw that happen just breathe here about five minutes then I'll give the
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:11.920]  number out again and go back to your phone calls and cover a bunch of news
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:17.400]  I've got to get to including a world that daily article with a retired major
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:24.800]  general coming out and Patrick Brady saying there is a purge of the military
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.480]  ongoing for those that won't carry out tyranny we already have this from our
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.120]  own high-level sources folks I mean I talked to high-level people that
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:37.120]  witnessed nukes being smuggled out of the Dias Air Force Base a month and a
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:40.080]  half ago they will not deny that and since them have fired the number one
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:44.080]  and number two new commanders and have fired a bunch of other people we know
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:48.200]  they were missing nukes in my not in 2007 Cheney was trying to have them
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:52.080]  smuggled out a bunch of people got fired over that but this time it's not even in
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.240]  the news that's another question for the professor we've got with us you know I'm
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:58.840]  seeing an awakening I want you to speak to that if you're seeing one as well
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.920]  sir and where you think this is going culturally but I'm also seeing while some
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:07.680]  folks are waking up that the the state-run media the establishment media is
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:13.440]  getting more in line with not asking questions and not I mean if I'm making
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.520]  this up about missing nukes I should be arrested I'm not making up this source
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.520]  I'm not making this up and now all hell broke loose after we broke this you
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.080]  think some mainstream media would touch it only Michael Savage has touched it
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.640]  and like WorldNet Daily and folks like drudgereport.com that link to our
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.440]  stories everybody else is totally scared what's your take on that there is I
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:44.080]  call it the conspiracy theory taboo there is a strong a powerful set of norms
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:51.560]  in the political class that prohibits any comment that suggests elite
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:59.400]  political criminality or conspiracy or suspicion think about this the Kennedy
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:03.460]  family never talked about president Kennedy being
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:07.840]  assassinated never raised questions about it we have books out now that have
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.840]  interviewed Robert Kennedy and friends of Robert Kennedy and that we realized
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:17.440]  now they were afraid oh yeah there's secretaries the letters have been put
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:20.560]  out public they all knew they were killed and we're told to shut up but but
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.720]  you know it's funny you mentioned that because think about it it's almost like
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.960]  a political correctness to not see corruption it's almost like a political
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:35.680]  blindness a political lobotomy is like a sacrament now absolutely what I was
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.960]  saying before the break was that these are obvious events think of 9-11 these
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:45.560]  buildings a hundred and ten stories high collapsed in ten seconds into their own
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:51.120]  footprints and you've got the the building seven that could has obviously
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:56.300]  controlled demolition yes you can see this hey I interviewed the deputy head
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:58:00.560]  of emergency management that said there were bombs in seven and he was there and
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:07.040]  then he died a week later yeah no that's the truth I mean the reality is we're
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:15.800]  dealing with a very sinister set of forces that are willing taking a life as
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:23.160]  a small matter in this arena and I think the elites understand that I think
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.880]  these are basically open secrets that they generally know that these people are
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:31.400]  not stupid they know that this is certainly something there back in 60
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:34.920]  seconds I want to talk about that exact people that's why I'm still alive and I've
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:38.520]  been told by some high-level sources they almost like people knowing what they're
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:51.720]  doing you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm today my friends Alex Jones

[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:20.000]  he he's alex jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.640]  alex jones
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:35.280]  all right we've got this segment and part of the next and share of Richard
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:38.400]  max popping in and I'll go back in your phone calls and all of the news I've
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:43.400]  got to get to but when you see all this political correctness and here's two
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:48.720]  examples just today man banned from Facebook for liking faggots and when
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.680]  you go to England this is in England when you go in any of the restaurants they
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:57.880]  say flaming faggot because you actually get these juicy meatballs all these
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:04.280]  spices on fire when they bring them out and for 500 plus years in the old
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.720]  English really 600 700 because I asked the people and looked it up that's been
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:14.160]  called flaming faggot it just means a flaming piece of meat or wood that's
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.720]  what they call it and it doesn't matter he's been kicked off but beheadings by
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:25.000]  al-qaeda that our government loves they those are allowed and all he said was man
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.480]  I wish you know that you know that you know I had a better recipe for for
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.640]  faggots and here's another one Mexican Americans don't care about your racist
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:39.520]  sombrero they've come out now in the news and said it's racist if you wear
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:44.280]  sombrero on Halloween or have one hanging on your wall or don't dress as a
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.800]  geisha girl on Halloween or a cowboy it's all about now everything is bad I
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.760]  mean isn't this just a war on reality and I'm talking this end of the
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:57.640]  political correctness of saying government can't be corrupt I mean how
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:02.080]  how ridiculous is that I mean do you see the the tie-in I'm doing here that
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.600]  that not just on the fake right but on the fake left it's all just really an
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:11.960]  authoritarianism yes I mean one of the shocking things to me it the left
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:18.320]  surprises me that this is comes out of a liberal tradition a socialist tradition
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.600]  a very questioning tradition and yet people that are very well known
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:29.000]  journalists on the left will not touch the idea of elite political
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.320]  criminality they don't want to be labeled a conspiracy theorist I can't help
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:37.120]  them believe in private they recognize this stuff I mean you have to be an
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:44.040]  idiot not to see some of this although the electorate is well indoctrinated to
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:50.720]  close their eyes to this so I don't mean to say that you know everybody should
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:56.080]  realize all this straightforward it took me a while to figure it out but it's
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.760]  still and you were saying is there an awakening I think there is I mean the
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:07.280]  the conspiracies or the coincidences keep piling up and that's the problem
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:13.200]  yeah you had the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination my
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:19.080]  colleagues in political science say that if they let any doubts grow about the
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:25.480]  president Kennedy at that possibly beings conspiracy did it raises all kinds
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:29.280]  of questions about Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King and George Wallace
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:33.360]  and well I've seen academics in Canada even in the Toronto Star I forget the
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:36.680]  academic I saw a few articles about four or five years ago they said look we know
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.800]  9-11 looks very suspicious we know it looks like they use it to invade and
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:43.960]  it's clearly a cover-up but if we bring this out it'll bring down the whole
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:48.760]  structure and we believe in big government structure and so we just want
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:53.560]  to cover it up I mean I've seen that yeah I mean I think of it we jokingly
[02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:58.120]  say it's like telling the child there is no Santa Claus you know the first thing
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:04.200]  the kid says is oh my goodness then you're there's no Easter rabbit there's no
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:10.360]  I mean the whole the whole thing collapses so I think what we're going to
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:15.520]  witness with the Kennedy assassination anniversary is an enormous effort to keep
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:18.360]  the lid on that no that's right and that's why they defend it and they've
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.320]  been whitewashing but over 90% in an index of polls don't believe the official
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:26.800]  story so I think that shows the collapse of the credibility I want to ask you
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.720]  about who you think overall this political elite represents how we get
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.080]  rid of them in a segment coming up a lot of segments at the end of the hour on

[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:27.360]  Jones
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.040]  society's going crazy you've got a lot of real violence a lot of real things that
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:34.400]  happened I'm getting all sorts of tweets Central Alex Jones saying what do I
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:39.160]  think was behind the LAX incident I don't know probably a real person went
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:42.880]  through might have been crazy might have been angry at somebody I don't know
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:48.280]  might have been a real event but we know they've staged mass shootings they've
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:52.640]  allowed crazy people to attack I know the Boston bombing they had a drill they
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:56.200]  had a stand down the media the FBI came and threatened our reporters with
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:01.120]  Secret Service on national TV and said do not talk about the drill which they
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:04.040]  admitted then they said there wasn't a drill later had to admit there was a
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:09.640]  drill both brothers were connected to the CIA one was on the CIA payroll this
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:15.400]  came out in major British and Russian newspapers I mean you understand that and
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:20.800]  they were clearly intelligence cutouts like Lee Harvey Oswald set up that was
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:26.960]  clearly meant as a political diversion I don't know what this is but Katie bar the
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.880]  door they staged Gulf of Tonkin by the way I have the San Diego Herald Tribune
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:36.760]  article that that came from about six months after Gulf of Tonkin and 64 that
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.360]  got us officially into Vietnam was already going on years before that and
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:45.360]  just to give an example how this works so I knew the officers that said that
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.160]  nobody attacked him it was staged and I was called a conspiracy theorist because
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.320]  I have the San Diego Herald Tribune and I had professors on and researchers and
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:10:00.200]  witnesses to this and then of course in 2004 the 40th anniversary they
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:05.000]  declassified the tapes that indeed the whole thing was staged now do we all
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.840]  get little gold stars for being right I mean a listener sent me the San Diego
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.760]  Herald Tribune I didn't just believe that I then had listeners go pull it up on
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.200]  the microfilm there to confirmed it was real and of course I'd always heard
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:23.320]  that see it became a rumor you know professor I were joined by Lance David
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.600]  Smith his book conspiracy theory in America I think everybody should read it
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.280]  how they've turned his questioning known liars into a you know a thought
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.680]  crime in closing I think that's one of the biggest issues here and then I want
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:38.840]  your take on who's running the globalist system how we counter it where is a
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:43.320]  historian you think this is going but that's the problem is that my listeners
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:46.880]  are great folks but so many times they call in with these rumors that can't be
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:51.600]  proven that I know or a rumor like telephone game 10 points removed from a
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:59.000]  real document but then it's like it becomes a rumor that Gulf of Tonkin
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.120]  was staged I mean it's still a rumor even though it's been declassified eight
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.960]  years ago or whatever seven years ago so I mean I think you get my point is the
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:10.640]  problem is history is so complex the general public it just becomes a he
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:16.800]  said she said that's exactly right Napoleon had a comment he said that it
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:23.360]  was not necessary to to prevent the truth from coming out for a forever just
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:28.280]  to prevent it for as long as it mattered exactly what happens is they this
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:35.160]  stuff comes out in 1997 we had a tape released of Lyndon Johnson talking to
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:43.120]  Everett Dirksen about Nixon undermining the peace talks in 1968 and
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:48.440]  Johnson said this is treason this is treason but I'm not going to tell the
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:53.240]  American people because it would destroy their confidence in the system of
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:57.840]  government so I think what you what you have when this comes out in 97 it's news
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:03.360]  for one day nobody goes back and says geez they stole the 1968 election
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:10.360]  Kennedy John Nixon was people don't realize this he was pardoned for every
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:16.360]  crime he might have committed now they didn't know what all crimes he had so
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:22.240]  they put in the pardon any crimes he might have committed it's like a blank
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:27.400]  check you know one big problem is the public feels powerless at some levels
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:31.120]  and I think that's why they will laugh at someone that tells them some great
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:36.040]  admitted truth because it's scary and so it's just easier to laugh at it Joseph
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:40.280]  Goebbels to paraphrase his quotes you know he said look the lot the lies need
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.760]  to be real simple and just repeat them over and over again because people are
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:48.960]  lazy and don't want to admit things are happening and so just give them lies
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:54.720]  that are easy to believe so that they don't have to do anything and I think
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:01.120]  there's a psychological warfare going on where the they want us I mean this
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.760]  sounds a little weird but they want us to know they're behind some of these
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:11.480]  events it's too obvious but it's what that does is so demoralizing I mean the
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.520]  buildings fall in 9-11 the anthrax letters come out nobody can solve this
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:20.520]  crime Kennedy we can't solve what does that tell people that tells people we
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:25.760]  are gonna do these things and there's a darn thing you can do about exactly I
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:29.640]  was told by a major banking executive off record wearing my journalism hat he
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:32.920]  didn't admit anything but he just said yeah and we don't care if you're out
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.280]  there telling people because you know we're just thrown in the public space
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:40.800]  but we have got that much power and it's like man do they really think this type
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:46.480]  of corruption can just go on forever and it's not gonna affect them that's the
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:52.280]  crazy thing is that the elite the political class obviously our
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.480]  institutions are failing they are they are being corrupted it's not just
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:03.040]  government it's economic it's financial I mean you know priest or pedophiles I
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:09.120]  mean we we're talking we got we got serious problems throughout and the
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:14.640]  elites act as if this you know they can just continue with impunity and not to
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:19.720]  hold anybody accountable and that this is not going to unravel but I mean what
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:25.440]  it what it does is it puts the burden on the American people to stand up and
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:30.160]  take back their democracy and until they're willing to do that we're gonna
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:34.840]  keep drifting like this and the elites are going to continue to bail out the
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.320]  banks and not the homeowners and pardon the criminals at the top and
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:42.880]  prosecute the people at the bottom well I think you've headed here professor and
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:47.560]  it's that you've got a system where the upper political class became bullet
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.000]  proof politically because of media aiding them and in the lower political
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.240]  class and now even just general criminals people can't believe that a
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.680]  priest or somebody can be doing something bad or Sandusky until it creates
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:03.720]  a culture of just rolling over to corruption and denying it until it takes
[02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:07.640]  over the society and then the society collapses and I think that's a whole
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:11.560]  another book in and of itself sir I want to thank you for coming on great job
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:15.160]  with the book conspiracy theory in America Lance to Haven Smith take care
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:20.160]  we'll be talking to you again soon thank you for having Wow powerful interview
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:25.080]  folks and he really gets it as a historian and I'm a lay historian I
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:28.520]  just find history so interesting I've read no exaggeration probably 500 history
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:32.880]  books it's a lot more than that you know I read a lot of history magazines and
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:37.200]  stuff back when I had time to do such a thing now I just read history repeating
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:42.280]  itself every day in the newspaper and I mean whoa this is bad I mean this is
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:48.440]  because here's a little about corruption it gets to a crest point it gets to a
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:52.320]  leverage point and then it just explodes and we've hit that but that's a
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:16:02.840]  cessation point and now there's a body politics swinging back and it's just
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:12.320]  really amazing now folks we do have Sheriff Richard Mack joining us for a
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.720]  quick update before he goes in and teaches a Constitution course to
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:18.560]  elementary school students that's where the real fight is and he understands
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:22.920]  that tirelessly traveling the country to warn people about what's happening but
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:25.360]  we've got him till the bottom of the hour them in a news blitz and take your
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:31.760]  calls he was there when Sheriff Nick Finch was found not guilty by a jury
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:38.480]  yesterday of upholding the Constitution that the state law in in Florida is
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:42.040]  written where you can carry a gun concealed in your car or your home for
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.520]  protection but the cop arrested him the sheriff's deputy for having it single he
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:48.720]  was in public and the sheriff said well I hired you to enforce the Second
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:52.600]  Amendment we're letting the guy out so they arrested him the governor came out
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:55.280]  against him the Republican leadership came out against him where the
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:00.680]  Democrats tried to put him in jail with a felony the jury found him not guilty
[02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:04.560]  but I wanted to get Sheriff Richard Mack to join us to talk about what it was
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:09.080]  like watching the trial over those two days and and what it was like to see the
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:12.560]  jury when they said not guilty and because this is a historical event
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.080]  of course Sheriff Richard Mack defeated the Brady law the Supreme Court so he's
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:19.760]  another hero sheriff but we've got another one joining the ranks big time
[02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:23.880]  by the way they tried to put Sheriff Mack in jail as well before and you know
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:27.720]  with fake investigations and Sheriff Arpaio and others I mean this is they
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:32.360]  come after these men that stand for America the fight is here folks these
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:37.400]  are soldiers of the Republic Sheriff Mack good to have you on with us thanks a
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:42.240]  lot Alex this is a tremendous victory for freedom and liberty and I so much

[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:59.120]  I really wish everybody could have been there all your listeners that would have
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.880]  been amazed this was the Constitution on trial in this courtroom this was the
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:10.000]  oath of office this was a constitutional sheriff defending himself
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:15.120]  against the state who had fired him taking away from his taking him away
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:21.400]  from his job took away his income trying to destroy himself and his
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:28.240]  family and serious when Sheriff Finch took the stand he was defending the
[02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:33.360]  oath of office he took to the Constitution he was defending nullifying
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:38.840]  on arrest of an innocent and everybody admitted that this man had no criminal
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:43.040]  record that he was not a prohibited felon that he had threatened no one that
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:48.400]  he'd committed no harm to anybody but because this deputy created the crime
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:54.880]  of possessing a gun in his in on his person without a permit then the
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:00.480]  sheriff came in looked at the entire situation and nullified the arrest of
[02:19:00.480 --> 02:19:07.680]  this poorly instructed deputy this happened just two months after Sheriff
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:15.000]  Finch was in office now the attack really came and the Florida Department of
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.960]  Law Enforcement investigated it never once interviewed the sheriff came in
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:24.320]  served a search warrant a recipe for booking him into his own jail the
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:30.680]  governor came in suspended and then get this alley the prosecutors and the
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:34.480]  Attorney General's office told Sheriff Finch we'll make this all go away we'll
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:39.240]  remove these felons from your record if you'll just leave the office of sheriff
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:45.080]  and never come back Sheriff Finch refused he went to court and a good jury
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:49.520]  saw through all the smoke screen and all the corruption of these corrupt
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:54.920]  prosecutors and a corrupt judge they recognized it for what it was Sheriff
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:59.280]  Finch nullified the arrest of Mr. Perry stay there stay there and the grand jury
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:03.680]  nullified that yes stay there my name is Frank Bates and I got a confession to
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:08.480]  make just a few days ago FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:13.720]  buy my entire stockpile of high-quality survival food it sounds crazy but I'll
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:18.800]  show you the exact letter they sent in a minute revealing FEMA's plot could land

[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:38.920]  really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't go to
[02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:42.840]  FEMA hates this calm to see what survival food is the number one item to hoard
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:48.200]  right now and why supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many
[02:20:48.200 --> 02:20:52.680]  stores across America do it now because I don't know how long it will be on the
[02:20:52.680 --> 02:21:01.000]  line so go to FEMA hates this calm while you can that's FEMA hates this calm

[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:19.520]  sunshine I don't know when I'm stuck in fools in prison and time keeps dragging
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:25.600]  on well Sheriff Nick trans was in Liberty County and he decided Liberty was
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:29.760]  what it was all about I remember reading the law it was ambiguous but clearly
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:33.400]  you could have a gun on your car to protect yourself so they false arrest
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:36.000]  and you're like this false arrest we can get in trouble for this release this guy
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.560]  but the state wants it misapplied this happens everywhere they want anti-gun
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:46.120]  anti-liberty police and sheriffs and they always go after folks that don't
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.800]  tow the line and that's why police will come to your house if your neighbor sees
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:53.360]  you with a gun getting in out of your car didn't matter the guns legal they'll
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:56.720]  take you to jail because they know they get in trouble if they don't let people
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:03.000]  sort it out later but Sheriff Finch's real crime was following the Constitution
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.440]  and as Sheriff Mack was just trying to eloquently say as we went to break well
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.360]  repeat what you said about historical this is and then get into watching the
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.560]  trial some of the nasty stuff the judge did and then what it was like when the
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:21.200]  jury came back with the not guilty verdict well it was truly a miracle all
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:25.240]  the way around and really appreciate all your listeners and their support
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:32.520]  Sheriff Finch took on this battle against the powers that you would not
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:37.560]  believe this this literally worse than fighting the IRS and going to court on
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:43.320]  stuff like that the government at every level went after it the county the
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:48.800]  the police officer even his own former employee then and current and the state
[02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:52.560]  the Attorney General's office the governor's office he's fighting all of
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:57.920]  that and he has no income he has no way to pay lawyers we still really need to
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:01.640]  get him donations to help pay for his legal fees but this is what happened
[02:26:01.640 --> 02:26:06.640]  this good man did exactly what you and I have been praying for and all your
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:09.760]  listeners been praying for that there would be a sheriff with the courage to
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:15.280]  tell the government leave this good man alone I'm no if I be a less I'm no if I
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:19.840]  what you did I'm going to protect him I'm going to stand by Sheriff Finch
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:23.800]  nullified the arrest of a good law-abiding citizen and then a good
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:29.760]  honest jury nullified the arrest of a good constitutional sheriff Alex this is
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:34.480]  so historical it's so cute it's an example now to the rest of the world
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:39.520]  this is what a sheriff is supposed to do and this is what a jury is supposed to
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:45.040]  do and what happens when a jury nullifies the corrupt acts of corrupt
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:49.800]  public officials freedom is the result and that is what happened in Liberty
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:54.760]  County Liberty is the result Liberty County we have a good honest sheriff there
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:59.680]  that wants to do the right thing he has been restored to his job and he hasn't
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:02.960]  got his back paid yet we think that's going to happen but it doesn't look
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:06.840]  like the state is going to pay for his legal fees we've got a lot of work to do
[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:10.480]  and a lot of support to still give him I want all of your listeners to go to
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.280]  CSCOA.org make a donation for Sheriff Finch and get involved in this process
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:21.240]  folks we have a solution we have proof and Sheriff Finch is the hero taking this
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:26.120]  to the streets and again your cell phone broke up a moment Sheriff Matt give
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:30.520]  out your website for the Constitutional Sheriff's Association again okay it's
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:39.520]  CSCOA stands for Constitutional Sheriff's Peace Officers Association CSCOA.org
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:42.720]  folks can look through it right there to sure they can look through it Sheriff
[02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:46.760]  Mac.com as well but the issue here is reading the law he'd he follow the law
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:50.920]  it shows how organized and evil these groups are they'll undoubtedly try to
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:55.840]  come back after him again because they know if they let one Constitutional
[02:27:55.840 --> 02:28:00.200]  Sheriff stand up they might all stand up and then there is the end of this lawless
[02:28:00.200 --> 02:28:05.200]  criminal anti-American takeover so it is our duty to back him and you and others
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:08.720]  and really take this hero around the country to be an example to others and
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:13.440]  stand together it's got to really make the anti-gunners mad but Sheriff in
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:16.840]  closing we only got a minute and a half highlights of the trial and when they
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:23.440]  said not guilty how upset was that judge that I saw prejudice seeing himself in
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:29.080]  the news they they were slumped down in their chairs looking like a little lost
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:33.480]  puppy but the rest of us were so thrilled it just we just couldn't believe
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:40.560]  the magnitude of the miracle that we got there we were all thrilled we we hug
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:47.280]  we cried we literally we cried and his daughter was just beautiful she's just
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:53.800]  16 years old her name's Amber and looks like Amber she's blonde his wife stood
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:58.440]  by him supported him and by the way Sheriff Finch I should add it was a
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:01.680]  combat veteran and they threatened him they said we're gonna go to war with you
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:06.200]  and he said I'm standing with America let's go to war yes and he said when
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:10.280]  the when the prosecutor badgered him about his belief in the Second Amendment
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:15.520]  he said counselor the Second Amendment and the Constitution must count for
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:21.360]  something and it was a most powerful moment of the whole trial when Finch
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:26.360]  gave that testimony of the Constitution and his dedicated dedication to the
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:30.560]  Second Amendment it was the biggest moment of the whole trial well good job

[02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:12.080]  we don't know probably not I just said that last segment I said probably not
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:16.480]  be real might be might be a staged event they've staged up before they'll
[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:20.120]  probably have media matters say that I said it was a staged event because they
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:22.480]  just lie to their audience and take stuff out of context or maybe they'll say
[02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:26.120]  I said Obama sent a tornado there to do it and just make it up and have no proof
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:29.560]  it's just people say why do I plug them when they have no traffic they write the
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:33.320]  talking points for the medium the White House actually writes that stuff to their
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:37.840]  minions to their trendies and like trendies with different color socks and
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:42.520]  stuff that makes it all okay and the handlebar mustaches and they have a
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.720]  little TV shows where they get up there anyways the point is is that report
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:54.120]  gunman off-duty tsa agent and again that cbs news local and they've already had a
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:57.880]  tsa agent at that airport say I'm God and stripped down naked and run around
[02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:02.120]  and they've also had a tsa agent at that airport rape a woman in the parking
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:08.160]  line and a bunch of other stuff that that's the lax where I had just taken a
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:11.240]  shower because I'm a clean freak at least I used to be when I had more time
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:14.800]  alright I've been out doing video shoots with Jesse Ventura it was in the
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:19.920]  afternoon went to my hotel took a shower put on fresh socks fresh shoes they had
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:26.440]  a car picked me up drove me to the airport lax I get out and I take my
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:30.960]  shoes off and I walk through and the tsa people go all mr. stinky feet your
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:35.000]  feet stink and I thought and I kind of smiled like you're joking right and
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.480]  they went oh you don't like that mr. stinky feet it's too big black guys and
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:43.680]  I was just like I don't like you talking to me like that's make you feel big
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:47.240]  they're like y'all just get on out of here as I was gonna grovel and like
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:52.560]  defecate on myself or something but the whole point was is that that is a mess
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:36:03.160]  that airport is a mess of lunatics absolute crazy weirdo bizarro people and
[02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:06.200]  that's all I can say and it's all a complete facade if you're flying out
[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:09.480]  of there on a private jet you just pull right up nothing happens you just go
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:13.920]  right in just boom you're out of there on a private jet it's just all pure bull
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:19.640]  fucks slave training for you that's come out in court I'll tell you they're
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:22.400]  bad enough though they've had fake drills at airports before they'll set up
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:25.520]  the person that thinks they're part of a drill they could have done that too I've
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.080]  told police tsa everybody do not be part of drills where they have you play the
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:34.640]  part of the playing close person that tries to sneak a gun through because
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:37.400]  they've done that before I'm not saying that's what happened here but they could
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.800]  have set this person up as the political a political diversion to get more
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:44.000]  funding or something they've been caught doing similar stuff they've got
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.840]  operation north woods which said they could stage it probably another mentally
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:54.840]  ill power-tripping person I mean who wants a job checking babies diapers while
[02:36:54.840 --> 02:37:00.120]  the government runs al-qaeda Jerry Sandusky and pedophiles and control freaks
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:05.120]  and now I've had a lot of TSA agents come out to my rallies and stuff I had a
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:08.440]  rally against the TSA where we stormed the Capitol twice and repeatedly with
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.640]  TSA folks that had other government jobs that got laid off said look you can get
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:17.640]  $25 $30 an hour I don't like being around the radiation I finally quit stop
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.000]  talking bad about us when I left that Dallas TSA one lady said there was
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.440]  another guy from Austin they said about half of them in your listeners we're not
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:30.080]  all pedophiles man we need the money we got families and we're trying to unionize
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:34.880]  we know it's all a bunch of bull so I know you're not all perverts okay but I
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:40.880]  know the supervisors are the jerks that enjoy being punks and I've been through
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:45.160]  it and I've dealt with it and I'm mad because I can't personally have you
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:49.520]  drag off one of my daughters and and and you know and have some I mean look I
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:55.920]  went to a rock concert folks and my buddy's wife is extremely attractive they
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:59.920]  didn't search anybody going to the VIP area at the back because I was invited
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:05.760]  in and man this woman saw her and came right over and literally literally went
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:09.400]  between her legs and grabbed her grab both of her butt cheeks which is
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:14.160]  squeezing them went over to her breasts and I mean it was so obvious the woman
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:21.240]  was enjoying it and I mean this is ridiculous and I watch these women you
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:27.720]  know searching folks it's I just can't handle it I watched these women at where
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:32.880]  was that with that that was in Atlanta with Ventura and the women sat there
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:36.960]  giggling and laughing going you know saying that they liked Ventura was
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:42.480]  black ladies everyone and he's sitting there and they're just grabbing and the
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.320]  guys grabbing his butt and grabbing his testicles and Ventura is actually going
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.720]  oh these Germany I'm moving I'm leaving and they're just like and the women are
[02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:55.400]  like taking pictures and going I mean I just can't handle it anymore I mean this
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:39:03.600]  is this is so ridiculous we had a story a couple days ago where by the way he
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:08.120]  never flew after a few more flights with that he quit flying then he was we were
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.760]  in the first class he goes that's it after this never again I mean and people
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:17.800]  say oh get over it let the they all know it's a fraud they all know it's a former
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:20.720]  governor Jesse Ventura they all know he's not a threat he's wearing a blue
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:27.080]  t-shirt and blue jeans and that's why pilots used to freak out and couldn't
[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:30.840]  fly after they just refused to fly anymore and so they stopped groping them
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.480]  and stopped body scanning them you're gonna trust them to fly the plane but
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:37.440]  you're not going to trust them see I'm going off into a rant I've got a ton of
[02:39:37.440 --> 02:39:43.040]  news your phone calls I need to get to it I need to shut up it's just that all
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:48.160]  of these memories in fact can we come back with that rendition of dream on by
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:52.800]  Rodney James because I think that really says it all all these things come back
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:57.000]  to me it's like the older I get now it's like I see one thing and then there's
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.280]  all the knowledge I guess the wisdom is what that is that you've had all these
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.360]  experiences and then it just builds up till you see the deeper pattern and it's
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.640]  just like it's just like that's why smaller and smaller stuff you can't
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:14.680]  take it because it brings up all the other stuff and at a certain point you're
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:18.560]  like I cannot put up with this anymore I'm getting to where I cannot put up with
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.720]  people's baloney not in business not in life not personally I just and it's no
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:28.720]  and I've actually put up with more work more hardship more things like that what
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:35.320]  I can't deal with is like all people's weird idiosyncrasies anyways I'm
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:40.720]  ranting oh boy I've got all this news I've got to cover it so much I haven't
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:44.680]  even gotten to I'm gonna move fast each caller one minute thank you for holding
[02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:50.200]  Pfeiffer in Florida you're on the air go ahead how you doing sir pretty good
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:55.800]  brother thank you for having me on your show I'm a long-time follower I wanted
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:00.680]  to bring something up you had a gas on about a week and a half ago Professor
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:05.440]  Griff and he was talking about the demonization of the entertainment industry
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:09.200]  and how they're targeting our use I kind of wanted to bring up the fact that I
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:13.240]  don't think a lot of adults really know what's going on I had to turn up my
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:17.720]  cable about like four years ago because of the end you end though a lot of these
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:22.680]  kids shows were kind of like you know throwing out there and my kid having to
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.480]  come to me and ask me all these different questions now I've been part of the
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:31.880]  entertainment industry myself more on the music and art side and I followed
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:36.880]  hip-hop since the 70s and I've seen how it's changed throughout the years and I
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:39.920]  know on your show it you know the talking about Obamacare and all these
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:43.800]  other issues are very important and you catering more toward adults but I think
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.880]  that you know we have to target up our the children ourselves and kind of be
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:52.680]  informed as parents because once they take over the children I mean it's
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:56.840]  gonna end I mean the children are pretty much our future there they're gonna be
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.760]  the future politicians you know the future police commissioners and so on
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:04.760]  and so forth and I don't think that really gets talked about enough so I
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:09.240]  kind of want to bring that to your attention as well as the difference
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:13.360]  between talking to somebody that's asleep versus somebody that's awake because I
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:16.840]  feel in my opinion talking to somebody that's asleep you kind of wasting your
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:20.320]  time because the person that sleeps only wants to wake up when they want to
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:24.400]  rather than the individual that's already awake and have some information
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:29.240]  I totally hear you and and I cover news which maybe 20% of the population even
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:33.400]  pays attention to and it's more highbrow and then then then even
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:37.200]  entertainment and of course news is dumb down as well but they are basing our
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:43.000]  children in sex and drugs and pedophilia and corruption and targeting young
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.760]  children and hip-hop and rap when it first came out was about empowerment and
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.680]  being honorable and then the establishment on record funded it to
[02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:54.280]  fund gangster rap and big fat guys dancing around about how the women were
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:57.720]  trash to bring down culture and now they've done that with all the other
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:00.640]  music are absolutely right by the way I just saw a headline we'll put it on
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:08.240]  screen it's up on info wars.com where Sean Penn has come out and said and again
[02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:14.320]  it's in the tiles on info wars.com that Ted Cruz should be committed to a
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:17.560]  mental institution he said this on Pierce Morgan I want to say something
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:23.200]  right here and right now I have hung out with Sean Penn I've also ran into him
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:28.640]  in Denver and talked to him I've talked to him on the telephone repeatedly Sean
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:34.760]  Penn is mentally disabled people think those are great actors because it comes
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:37.160]  off like they're such a good actor because they're not put on an act they're
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:43.560]  not the guy is probably has about a 75 IQ okay I mean and I'm not going to say
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:46.240]  any more about it because I don't hang around with people and talk about about
[02:43:46.240 --> 02:43:49.560]  him but I've had enough of him like a Soviet commissar he wouldn't know what
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:54.600]  that is saying put Ted Cruz in a mental institution the video is up on info
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:44:00.880]  wars.com with that slime bag Pierce Morgan Kurt Nemo wrote about it and it
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:07.880]  makes me absolutely sick that he's an authoritarian saying and arrest people
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:12.720]  because Ted Cruz said Obamacare was a screw job Obama isn't bad for lying and
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:16.000]  saying nobody lose their healthcare and premiums wouldn't go up and committing
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.520]  and saying it was a conspiracy theory no no Obama's not in trouble for the
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:23.080]  torture of the secret arrest or Clinton stealing tens of millions of dollars of
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:29.480]  the Haitian funds Sean Penn's too stupid so I want to give him a pass though he
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:34.600]  was told to say that and when you're talking to Sean Penn he doesn't talk
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:39.880]  because if you actually get him to talk he is an idiot and he's actually come
[02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:43.760]  out before in a moment of clarity and said that he's basically retarded and
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:46.680]  I'm nothing against mentally handicapped people but I've had enough of Sean Penn
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:55.040]  Sean Penn why don't you go finger paint buddy okay you are stupid you are
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.120]  dumber than a box of rocks and let me tell you Josh Brolin acts pretty darn
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:02.440]  dumb when I was around him too I mean you guys are a bunch of idiots a bunch of
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:05.920]  narcissists who want to act like you're liberal when you're pushing authoritarian
[02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:12.680] ism we've even got the clip of the Pearl Jam idiot too running around to his
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:16.800]  moron fans saying we should you know ban guns and then you know restrict second
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:20.840]  amendment while this guy is on record having armed former army and Navy Seal
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.280]  bodyguards he's such a coward no one even knows who that guy is if a few of his
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:28.080]  moron fans I mean let me tell you something I've hung around with major
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:30.800]  rock stars everybody knows who Dave Mustaine is people but because he's so
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:33.640]  iconic but I've hung around with big rock stars maybe even bigger than Dave
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:36.920]  Mustaine but who haven't been in the limelight a ton or whatever no one knows
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:40.960]  who they are I mean I've been sitting there before somebody way more famous I
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:43.920]  would think of my mind and me the crowds are all coming up to me because I'm

[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.360]  those that died but this is just really absolutely totally disgusting what's
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:34.440]  going on I'm gonna go into overdrive some stations carry it some don't to
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:38.880]  continue I've got to get to all this other Israel attacking Syria the economic
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:43.200]  news a bunch of new Obamacare stuff that's been breaking that I haven't
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:49.040]  gotten to I've got to get to all this briefly the new magazine is out you can
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:52.840]  buy them in bulk at cost or give a year subscription at cost my point is we've
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:58.000]  we've we've priced this with the shipping included so that you can really get the
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:01.600]  most bang for the buck big color magazine full of more than 20 plus
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:08.160]  articles documents cartoons stories graphs is the next big crash coming and
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:13.560]  it breaks down the Ponzi scheme and who's behind that info or store.com or you
[02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:19.800]  can call toll free 888-253-3139 a one-year subscription is 3995 that
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.080]  includes the 12th shipping so we have to probably lose money on that actually but
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:28.600]  whatever the point is take advantage of it this is a big color magazine to give
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:34.040]  to people to really give them a powerful packed piece of info so info or
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:39.440]  store.com or 888-253-3139 that is your purchasing of the books the videos the
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.840]  appropriate water filters discounted with promo code water the modifying that's
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:48.200]  got the great nason iodine naturally in it the our special proprietary info or

[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:06.040]  and to go watch the videos about it and what it's done for myself and so many
[02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:09.960]  others this is different than all the other iodine out there from my research
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:13.240]  and the experience I've had the bottom line even if you don't get this it's the
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:18.560]  Himalayan salts that all the doctors and people say has the natural healthy iodine
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:22.000]  in it as well not the chemical iodine the stuff that you put on your leg with a
[02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:26.880]  cut or whatever and this is the big conspiracy to not have you be aware of
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:30.800]  the radiation levels going way up and more and more problems not just from
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:34.040]  Fukushima but a bunch of leaking reactors here it is the nascent that
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:41.080]  really protects the thyroid and the other glands to enforce life.com or 888-253-3139
[02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:47.080]  again some of the other news they're trying to get amnesty as they call it
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:52.400]  and it is amnesty it is total open borders to drive down wages and if you
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:56.600]  like going to part time now because of Obamacare you're gonna love the 30

[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:20.440]  implode our country and that's the globalist plan I understand economics
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:25.240]  but this is a 101 this is not hard to understand DHS by the way is abusing

[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:20.320]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:23.880]  alex jones
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:40.280]  we're taking your phone calls we've got a spoof piece up on info words dot com of
[03:00:40.280 --> 03:00:44.800]  Sesame Street talks about the Obama enrollees all six of them and that's
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:48.920]  the idiots that they've gone and helped actually enroll in the fake system just
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:52.960]  to create the illusion that mythically somebody won the lottery I guarantee you
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:56.800]  the psych warfare program is this is like a lottery now it's all about the
[03:00:56.800 --> 03:01:01.800]  mythical free health care you get while they destroy the health care totally
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:06.840]  executed with precision hatred let's talk to Mike in California Mike you're on
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:13.440]  the air go ahead sir thanks for holding I've been following the L.A. shooting
[03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:19.440]  since you kind of broke it earlier what probably is how did an F-16 style weapon
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:24.280]  get past the front doors of the airport well here's the deal the guys pointed
[03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:28.680]  out that they had an active shooter drill a week ago there and then two weeks to
[03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:33.600]  go with their sister airport at Muscagon holds active shooter drill and I've
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:40.960]  talked a lot of cops who have exposed false flags off record are things that
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:43.080]  they were clearly going to be false flags where they were trying to get off
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:48.000]  duty cops or informants to be part of a drill who they were really going to set
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:55.560]  up so that is in the carts that this would be a drill then you would have
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:02:00.320]  somebody else concealed shoot the people and then shoot the shooter but
[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:04.440]  that's in the cards I'm not saying that happened knowing the psychology of a
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:08.640]  large portion of TSA agents they probably was probably what you see is
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:12.960]  like going postal and that probably fired somebody it's gonna come out or
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:16.760]  they were on some type of serotonin reuptake inhibitor I mean again and
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:20.560]  again if you study it it's like what's most probable
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:27.040]  egomaniac going postal who was also on a drug that makes you get rid of
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:31.080]  compulsion control because I would imagine everybody's had like a thought of
[03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:34.680]  wanting to bash somebody's brains in but you have control over that well you
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:38.800]  start taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors or that similar family you
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:41.560]  get a compulsion to chop your two-year-old's arms off with them with a
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:46.840]  machete you know mama does it and then dances around the front yard with a dead
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:52.320]  baby so that's what this does so I would imagine it's gonna be a prozac head on a
[03:02:52.320 --> 03:02:58.240]  power trip what do you think I totally agree on a second no I'm also one of
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:02.920]  those Americans that doesn't want to be getting government assistance but kind of
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:06.880]  have to with you know hours getting cut and oh no no no I get it they have
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:12.160]  designed it where it's very hard to to try to make it on your own that's the
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:16.920]  plan yeah yeah me and my wife we both work and you know we still need to get
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:22.280]  some form of assistance and it kind of upset me that these people when we have
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:25.240]  to go turn in our paperwork to the law firm office that are sitting in the
[03:03:25.240 --> 03:03:29.280]  parking lot in Mercedes Benz is and me and my wife we have a car that barely
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:32.760]  works well that's because that's because you're not part of a really protected
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:37.680]  group aka illegals but that's all they're only allowed to on record have 1015
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:41.200]  welfare checks you know you know per mom while the dad does work for super low
[03:03:41.200 --> 03:03:46.360]  wages to drive down wages they're not the bad guys even even though it's a
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:50.280]  moral because they're fleeing collapsed globalist countries they get here they
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.920]  are allowed to do this but only for a season until they've imploded all the
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:59.520]  wages so it's so again Obamacare has already imploded them when they legalized
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:03.000]  that the 30 million illegals was pretty much already done by fiat it's gonna
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:07.560]  implode even more and so yeah no I can't blame the working poor well no the
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:11.320]  I mean the Health and Human Services said last week we recommend you tell
[03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:16.400]  your employees who are going from full-time to part-time to get welfare
[03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:21.080]  supplemental assistance this is the new American way this is the clowered and
[03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:28.240]  piven goal the year all juggled two or three different jobs at a time just try
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:31.520]  to make ends meet well I mean it's your responsibility if I was you I'm not
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:35.080]  telling you do this but I would do this if you're working poor blue collar it's
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:38.800]  time to go like the illegals and mow yards and do handyman stuff on a cash
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:43.760]  operation they've designed the taxes in the system where where you have to give
[03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:46.360]  up your dignity and go get money from them to survive when you're working two
[03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:52.360]  three jobs this has been their plan the whole time and everybody's gonna end up
[03:04:52.360 --> 03:04:55.840]  going welfare by the time they're done except for the globalists in France they
[03:04:55.840 --> 03:05:03.240]  have a 100% tax on the middle class my friends Alex Jones here to tell you

[03:08:17.480 --> 03:08:20.720]  know the tides turned against them they're illegal
[03:08:20.720 --> 03:08:25.000]  anopticonic total surveillance grid that they've been putting in place that we
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  paid for being used against us he's now coming out in the open and they tried to
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:38.800]  bill mr. Snowden as a criminal but then Russia took him and now the German
[03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:43.760]  government's wanting to talk to him and so now he's seen as a worldwide hero so
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:47.400]  that's why they try to keep saying he's a criminal he's a trader he's bad no the
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:51.480]  people doing this are traders and they're systematically dismantling our
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:55.800]  country but here's some of the headlines up on info wars calm and it's also on
[03:08:55.800 --> 03:09:02.480]  drugs report calm Germany prepared to speak with Snowden it's back at USA he's
[03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:07.480]  not hitting back at the USA folks he's hitting back at the criminals there's a
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:11.080]  new pullout democratic incumbents are in big trouble that's great we need to get
[03:09:11.080 --> 03:09:15.360]  tea party republicans were real tea party republicans elected that's why the
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:20.560]  republican and democratic establishment are on record going after libertarian
[03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:24.680]  takeover the republican party I mean that that can happen folks we can beat
[03:09:24.680 --> 03:09:29.280]  these people if we believe in it and take action mother Jones shocker new
[03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:34.400]  poll shows democratic incumbents in big trouble and democratic districts new
[03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:40.840]  net incumbent approval has plummeted by 11 points plus 8 approval to 3 plus
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.320]  disapproval in republican districts incumbent approval has gone down by
[03:09:44.320 --> 03:09:48.640]  only four points so the truth is the democrats know to blame their own
[03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:52.120]  people and it's not that the republican leadership is any better they're just as
[03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:57.040]  bad or worse in some cases but the difference is Obama is getting the
[03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:00.480]  blame for this and that's good at a level the banks and insurance companies
[03:10:00.480 --> 03:10:04.840]  that wrote it should get the full blame but it's important he be destroyed because
[03:10:04.840 --> 03:10:10.760]  he's the the carrier of all this like a rat carries the bubonic plague and so
[03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:15.360]  do we have the Sesame Street piece ready I want to play this little piece
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:21.600]  dealing with the six enrollees of Obamacare that have successfully enrolled
[03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:36.720]  here is the spoof my favorite number is six but nobody's favorite number is six
[03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:45.120]  sometimes I spend the whole afternoon sitting around and singing a tune about
[03:10:45.120 --> 03:10:53.120]  six six sometimes I think of six bricks but that's very boring or else I
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:58.680]  think of six sticks that's even more boring not five bricks or sticks but
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:03.320]  six now two is your eyes and once your nose and
[03:11:03.320 --> 03:11:07.760]  five is your fingers or your toes and four is the legs on an easy chair yet
[03:11:07.760 --> 03:11:13.720]  there's no number can compare with six about nine or three nothing more love
[03:11:13.720 --> 03:11:20.960]  way than six I don't know Bert when someone says hey Bert pick a number well
[03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:29.560]  I always think the one nobody takes my favorite number is six you know I hate
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:33.920]  to break this to you Bert but six isn't anybody's favorite number that's my
[03:11:33.920 --> 03:11:39.400]  favorite number I mean six just sort of sits there between five and seven you
[03:11:39.400 --> 03:11:43.680]  know you have five fingers on your hand and there are seven days in a week what
[03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:49.240]  there's not really six of anything I know I know now two is your eyes and
[03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:53.920]  ones your nose and five is your fingers or your toes and four is the legs on an
[03:11:53.920 --> 03:12:00.240]  easy chair yet there's no number can compare with six all right Bert nothing
[03:12:00.240 --> 03:12:06.840]  more lovely than six have it your way when someone says hey Bert pick a
[03:12:06.840 --> 03:12:16.160]  number well I always pick the one nobody takes my favorite number is six
[03:12:23.920 --> 03:12:28.920]  Harry what are you doing can I sit in my chair huh not right now Bert I'm
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:33.480]  thinking Bert about what I'm thinking about my favorite number Bert oh really
[03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:44.320]  what is it what is it 8,243,721 Bert I still like six it's actually tens of
[03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:49.240]  millions that have tried to enroll in Obamacare and again the cover of New
[03:12:49.240 --> 03:12:56.520]  Yorker magazine has Obama and Sebelius and some idiot nerd trying to make a
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:13:01.440]  computer work with a floppy disk folks they designed this this way you're
[03:13:01.440 --> 03:13:05.240]  never getting anything free the bill says it and you're going to get your
[03:13:05.240 --> 03:13:10.000]  prices increased and you're going to get small hospitals shut down it's all
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:20.720]  public it's all public I mean you notice exactly what we said happened and I'm
[03:13:20.720 --> 03:13:24.560]  talking to the Obama supporters but you know what really matters look at this
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:30.480]  article Hallmark accused of homophobia after changing gate of fun in Deck the
[03:13:30.480 --> 03:13:34.720]  Halls lyric so so first they didn't want to hurt people by saying the word gay
[03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:38.440]  which was in the original deck the halls deck the halls you know with gay
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:42.200]  apparel and stuff meaning happy apparel now it's homophobic to change it see
[03:13:42.200 --> 03:13:46.280]  there's no way and then of course so they're even worse a man in England who
[03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:50.440]  liked fried meatballs that are called faggots and call that for hundreds of
[03:13:50.440 --> 03:13:54.680]  years well he's been removed but al-qaeda can chop heads off on Facebook and
[03:13:54.680 --> 03:14:01.640]  YouTube and that's allowed that's London Guardian thought I'd mention that to
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:06.400]  everybody for you about what's going on on that front and remember Premier
[03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:11.000]  Hospitals is being reported by US News and World Report they're allowed to opt
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.520]  out of course it was written to shut down their competition and again my dad
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:19.360]  is in health care management not just in major dental health care management but
[03:14:19.360 --> 03:14:22.760]  he was another health care management and they were trying to under Obamacare
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:28.600]  make him just basically push vaccines and pills and he could make a wool most
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:32.800]  money is ever made in his life doing this and he didn't do it so doctors
[03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:34.960]  because that's how they have a lot of state laws that doctors have to run
[03:14:34.960 --> 03:14:38.240]  medical systems so they'll get they'll get doctors that are trustworthy and
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:44.840]  smart business wise to run health care systems no one moral will be part of
[03:14:44.840 --> 03:14:48.880]  this and it's also written where they can arrest you anytime they want if you
[03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:53.960]  don't engage in the activities they want so it's very very sick this just was
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:58.240]  posted on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com we always forget to post
[03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:04.640]  stuff on prisonplanet.com top generals reveal Obama's secret high level
[03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:08.880]  military purge and a drudge has a story from WorldNet Daily on the right hand
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:13.400]  side write a below article about the Chinese spy ship it's on the right hand
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:17.560]  side so go check that out and then go to infowars.com and check out top
[03:15:17.560 --> 03:15:23.720]  generals reveal Obama's secret high level military purge now remember we've
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:27.040]  had a Navy SEAL on saying that the officers above them that he talks to
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:31.120]  are being asked will you confiscate guns we have military videos sent to us of
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:34.960]  them saying that FEMA is preparing them for this mission during a suspension of
[03:15:34.960 --> 03:15:40.440]  the Constitution we have brigade homeland openly training for this and
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:44.400]  Army times and North com all the admissions and all the urban warfare
[03:15:44.400 --> 03:15:48.720]  training and homeland security spending hundreds of millions per state for armed
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:53.000]  guards and riot control around welfare centers I mean this is a serious
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:57.880]  situation and this is all social engineering they again they get total
[03:15:57.880 --> 03:16:01.280]  government in place put in a system to bankrupt the middle class make poor even
[03:16:01.280 --> 03:16:05.400]  poorer and then they start cutting the welfare and they use the civil unrest to
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:09.800]  bring in full control I don't know if that's Obama's strategy but that's what
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:14.480]  the globalists have done everywhere else I don't know if they're going to feel
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:19.440]  feel frisky enough to try this because we've not been in a in a land on our
[03:16:19.440 --> 03:16:23.560]  back stance to this libertarians constitutionalist real conservatives
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:28.000]  classical liberals that want justice have all been fighting this and exposing
[03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:31.160]  this and you notice a lot of mainline established like cut the welfare cut it
[03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:34.120]  cut it it's a big part of the deficit compared to the derivatives and the
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:37.840]  corporate welfare it's small and I agree we shouldn't have a dependent class
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:42.040]  because it makes some government minions to vote to take my guns I get all
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:46.480]  that and and and to say my kids belong to them in fact I never played that let's
[03:16:46.480 --> 03:16:50.080]  play that clip in a minute of MSNBC to remind folks of how arrogant they are I
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:56.160]  get all that I understand all that we have to phase them off of it and bring
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:01.560]  back economic opportunities and low taxes the American dream so that all these
[03:17:01.560 --> 03:17:06.080]  poor folks can be who can be moved off the social safety net can be moved back
[03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:11.440]  into working and make it a safety net not a web to catch little flies for the
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:17.600]  foreign banks to eat you more easily we we don't want a spider's web of evil we
[03:17:17.600 --> 03:17:20.960]  want a safety net that should be run by the states and local governments and
[03:17:20.960 --> 03:17:25.560]  churches by the way here they are those saying your kids belong to them we
[03:17:25.560 --> 03:17:29.560]  haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children so part of it is
[03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:32.880]  we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their
[03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:36.280]  parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole
[03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:39.900]  communities once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the
[03:17:39.900 --> 03:17:43.320]  households then we start making better investment then the term is the famous
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:47.520]  socialist term lean forward because to socialists they see that know what it is
[03:17:47.520 --> 03:17:53.200]  now now let's continue here top generals reveal Obama's secret high-level military
[03:17:53.200 --> 03:17:58.600]  purge and the big issue here and why this is so important this just broke
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:03.000]  Anthony good she already is this is this backs up the two top newt generals fired
[03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:07.640]  right after we reported on the missing eggs all the other purges going on this
[03:18:07.640 --> 03:18:13.080]  is a major general going public congressional Medal of Honor winner
[03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:19.040]  speaking on record with world net daily major general Patrick Brady says that
[03:18:19.040 --> 03:18:24.160]  they are purging the military of people that will not accept the gun confiscation
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:27.960]  all the tyranny and all the rest of it so we don't need to be told this to know
[03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:32.000]  it it's dozens of top generals they've been canning and getting rid of but the
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:36.600]  two top newt commanders one of them the day we broke that story he was fired and
[03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:41.040]  we have this is a real source about these missing nukes by the way and who
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:45.520]  won't talk to us anymore I don't blame them you know drop a potato on like
[03:18:45.520 --> 03:18:49.560]  that's a hot potato right there I said I'd get to all these calls we'll skip this
[03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:53.240]  network break go to the bottom of the hour but I do have a ton of important
[03:18:53.240 --> 03:18:58.880]  work to do but what's more important than being on air here let me mention some
[03:18:58.880 --> 03:19:01.960]  more news skip this network break and then I'll go back to your calls quickly
[03:19:01.960 --> 03:19:07.400]  here at the end of the transmission but Anthony good she already at info wars

[03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:15.760]  together right there we're also going to tweet this out at real Alex Jones as soon
[03:19:15.760 --> 03:19:19.560]  as I end the official show here in about 10 minutes so please retweet that out
[03:19:19.560 --> 03:19:24.560]  for us and pray for us by the way I mean I'm all gutted up here and on the air all
[03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:31.400]  day and just kind of rampaging through the news sometimes even forgetting to
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:39.160]  breathe but it's it's pretty crazy what we're all in together we are all in
[03:19:39.160 --> 03:19:42.400]  this together don't forget that Israeli planes of course strike Syrian
[03:19:42.400 --> 03:19:46.240]  military bases US official says Israeli military airplanes struck military
[03:19:46.240 --> 03:19:52.680]  base near the Syrian port city of Latakita by saying Latakaya this week an
[03:19:52.680 --> 03:19:57.480]  Obama administration official not a servant an official told CNN last night
[03:19:57.480 --> 03:20:02.600]  an explosion to missile storage site the area was reported in the Middle Eastern
[03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:07.800]  press when attack has not been confirmed by the Israeli government boy I tell you
[03:20:07.800 --> 03:20:12.160]  a continuing study finds conventional chicken to be highly contaminated with
[03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:17.260]  arsenic that's okay fed says spending cuts hurt economy QE infinity will
[03:20:17.260 --> 03:20:21.000]  continue only giving big banks the money though not even the public you're
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:24.800]  gonna have inflation might as well give to the public then continuing I want to
[03:20:24.800 --> 03:20:28.560]  play the Pearl Jam clip we have a cute ride up here in a moment right where he
[03:20:28.560 --> 03:20:33.400]  pushes his gun grabbing garbage but here's the big news I should have covered
[03:20:33.400 --> 03:20:37.240]  all day more and we'll probably cover this on the nightly news natural news
[03:20:37.240 --> 03:20:43.840]  dot com Ethan a Huff reports this it's also on info wars dot com cyspa attack
[03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:49.640]  on internet freedom of speech is back with a vengeance and it goes on to say
[03:20:49.640 --> 03:20:53.800]  here that they have reintroduced the legislation that does the exact same
[03:20:53.800 --> 03:20:58.360]  thing it did before but this time there's almost no public outcry on that
[03:20:58.360 --> 03:21:03.800]  front I was mentioning Snowden earlier the good news is is it's they've lost the
[03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:08.080]  PR war that people that report on crime and expose crime are the bad guys know
[03:21:08.080 --> 03:21:11.160]  the guys doing the crimes are the bad guys and Edward Snowden says he's
[03:21:11.160 --> 03:21:17.480]  willing to come to Germany after meeting with German lawmaker but we'll see if
[03:21:17.480 --> 03:21:22.760]  that ends up happening they may force his plane down with NATO F-16s they've
[03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:25.720]  already tried that when they thought he was on a plane and what was in Austria
[03:21:25.720 --> 03:21:31.200]  unprecedented criminal activity Germany again advises journalists to stop
[03:21:31.200 --> 03:21:35.160]  using Google like Matt dredge famously said you need to go back to the parking
[03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:39.760]  garages like deep throat Germany advises journalists to stop using Google over
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:45.960]  US spying concerns may ask Snowden to testify against NSA and then of course
[03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:50.520]  the documents have come out how they spy on with Google on the people so that's
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:59.280]  just some of the news on that front we're gonna go ahead now and play a clip
[03:21:59.280 --> 03:22:04.880]  of Pearl Jam singer stops concert to push gun control you know that's a good
[03:22:04.880 --> 03:22:08.760]  headline but how about to push victim disarmament this is the guy that has
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:35.120]  armed guards and here he is talking to his moron fans back it up this is what
[03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:39.560]  they always do Sean Penn says put Ted Cruz with an executive order in a mental
[03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:44.420]  institution when he needs to be in a rubber room himself very low IQ big
[03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:48.560]  idiot many many times talk to him on the phone not just meeting him in person
[03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:53.600]  and talking to him and I mean you really realize this person is a good more
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:58.600]  moron and and you notice like they want to take away your freedom of speech no
[03:22:58.600 --> 03:23:03.120]  you're trying to take my guns you're the one trying to take my right to defend
[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:06.840]  myself and everything else and try to take my free speech away with the
[03:23:06.840 --> 03:23:16.920]  fairness doctrine amazing and one of our listeners shot this video on YouTube and
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:23.720]  this is the Eddie Vedder saying that we're trying to take his free speech no
[03:23:23.720 --> 03:23:29.960]  see with a progressive authoritarian who progresses the evil disagreeing with
[03:23:29.960 --> 03:23:33.840]  them is racist or hateful and then if you vehemently say how dare you try to
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:37.760]  take my rights my property my right to self-defense while you have bodyguards
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:44.800]  that turns in trying to take his free speech away you're a liar Eddie Vedder
[03:23:44.800 --> 03:24:05.400]  what a piece of trash let's go back to the clip listen to this
[03:24:15.120 --> 03:24:24.400]  to speak on this issue
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:42.360]  and you will take some hits if you put it out there but that's the thing I just
[03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:46.360]  I just want to clarify that we've done some research, and I've talked to some very
[03:24:46.360 --> 03:24:50.360]  much smarter than people who've been messing with us.
[03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:54.360]  There's a lot of them.
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:24:59.360]  But the myth that the Dunn lobby is the most powerful lobby in our country is a myth.
[03:24:59.360 --> 03:25:00.360]  That's a myth.
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:02.360]  The one I'm telling you about is the most...
[03:25:02.360 --> 03:25:04.360]  That's a good thing I need it off the screen, thank you.
[03:25:04.360 --> 03:25:08.360]  The article's up on infoawards.com by Don Salazar, Pearl Jam Singer,
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:10.360]  stops concert to push down control.
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:11.360]  He says, we've got to get organized.
[03:25:11.360 --> 03:25:12.360]  We've got to come after them.
[03:25:12.360 --> 03:25:13.360]  We've got to get their guns.
[03:25:13.360 --> 03:25:15.360]  And keeps couching it in.
[03:25:15.360 --> 03:25:17.360]  They can't stop our free speech.
[03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:18.360]  They're not going to stop us.
[03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:21.360]  Like, we're trying to take their first amendment when they're going after everything.
[03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:23.360]  They're the ones going after everything.
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:27.360]  And he sits there couching it with, like, 50,000 mindless idiots,
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:30.360]  cheering and loving it, and him going,
[03:25:30.360 --> 03:25:32.360]  oh, it's a myth, and it's a myth.
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:36.360]  The guns make us a myth, a myth, a myth, a myth.
[03:25:36.360 --> 03:25:39.360]  I mean, he's just an idiot.
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:41.360]  Unbelievable.
[03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:42.360]  Let's go ahead and...
[03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:43.360]  USA!
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:44.360]  USA!
[03:25:44.360 --> 03:25:45.360]  There you go.
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:46.360]  That's what they'll chant when they take our guns.
[03:25:46.360 --> 03:25:47.360]  USA!
[03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:49.360]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in California.
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:50.360]  Steve, you're on the air.
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:51.360]  Go ahead.
[03:25:51.360 --> 03:25:52.360]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:55.360]  A pleasure to talk with you.
[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:57.360]  First-time caller, admin listener.
[03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:01.360]  The October 3rd incident at our nation's capital
[03:26:01.360 --> 03:26:07.360]  with the Marion Kerry, the hygienist gun down by Obama goons.
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:15.360]  Is there any truth that she's tied closer than is out in the media?
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:18.360]  Well, I mean, she thought that when she ran into the checkpoint,
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:20.360]  as I predicted, they were bad men coming after her.
[03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:24.360]  She ran into an army checkpoint that was random, part of a drill,
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:27.360]  bumped into it, ran away, then cops smashed down the barriers,
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:28.360]  and they chased her.
[03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:30.360]  She panicked, and they killed her.
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:33.360]  And they are being given gold medals and stuff by Congress.
[03:26:33.360 --> 03:26:37.360]  So great, great, great heroes.
[03:26:37.360 --> 03:26:41.360]  But she was a woman being treated for anxiety and other stuff,
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:46.360]  and she got scared at a third-world checkpoint, and ran, and she died.
[03:26:46.360 --> 03:26:51.360]  Has you and your investigative team looked into anything further,
[03:26:51.360 --> 03:26:55.360]  some of the stuff that's going around that Obama's loved child
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:58.360]  could have been in the backseat kind of thing?
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:01.360]  Well, the word is he's not even bisexual.
[03:27:01.360 --> 03:27:06.360]  He likes men, so like, I mean, I don't think that's possible.
[03:27:06.360 --> 03:27:10.360]  So, I mean, he's the loved child of a famous communist pornographer,
[03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:12.360]  but the evidence all points towards that.
[03:27:12.360 --> 03:27:14.360]  But thank you so much.
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:15.360]  We'll look into that.
[03:27:15.360 --> 03:27:18.360]  I've heard that, but there's no real proof that I've seen.
[03:27:18.360 --> 03:27:20.360]  When men could start having babies,
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:22.360]  then we got to worry about loved children with Obama.
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:27.360]  Let's talk to, let's like, Hillary only had the, you know,
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:30.360]  Chelsea for a prop with Clinton.
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:33.360]  He likes to beat up and rape women. She likes girls.
[03:27:33.360 --> 03:27:34.360]  And I'm not attacking him.
[03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:38.360]  The fact is, you know, we've already had a lesbian first lady
[03:27:38.360 --> 03:27:39.360]  and a rapist president.
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:42.360]  Let's talk to Dallas in Canada.
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:44.360]  Last call, we have Tom Forshauer for the others.
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:46.360]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:48.360]  Hey, Alex. Nice to finally talk to you.
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:49.360]  I've been a listener for 10 years now.
[03:27:49.360 --> 03:27:52.360]  I'm living up here in the nanny state on Ontario.
[03:27:52.360 --> 03:27:55.360]  We just cut down some trees in our yard,
[03:27:55.360 --> 03:27:57.360]  and the bureaucrats come over, taking pictures,
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:00.360]  because we cut down trees. You can't cut down trees in your own,
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:01.360]  on your own property.
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:03.360]  Oh yeah, they're going to hit you with some fines and stuff.
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:06.360]  Again, they've got to end all normal agriculture and human life.
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:09.360]  Yeah, but there's no regulations or anything on big corporations.
[03:28:09.360 --> 03:28:11.360]  They can do whatever they want.
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:14.360]  And then we had a tent that was close to the road,
[03:28:14.360 --> 03:28:16.360]  and you have to have a certain distance from the road.
[03:28:16.360 --> 03:28:18.360]  So I think that's pretty crazy.
[03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:21.360]  Oh yeah, it's always fun to set up a tent in the front yard
[03:28:21.360 --> 03:28:23.360]  for kids to play in, but it's like,
[03:28:23.360 --> 03:28:24.360]  even if you live in the country now,
[03:28:24.360 --> 03:28:27.360]  it's like a giant UN neighborhood association.
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:30.360]  That's what Gen 21 is, harassing everyone.
[03:28:30.360 --> 03:28:35.360]  It's one of those car tents where you park your car in it.
[03:28:35.360 --> 03:28:38.360]  Oh, that's even more, oh, that's racist.
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:41.360]  No, no, I took some brown paper towels yesterday
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:45.360]  when I spilled some tea in the shipping room,
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:47.360]  and the crew pointed out that I was being racist
[03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:49.360]  using brown paper to stop something up.
[03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:52.360]  That was really code against brown people.
[03:28:52.360 --> 03:28:55.360]  And then one other thing is I've noticed,
[03:28:55.360 --> 03:28:59.360]  because I'm a Muslim, I noticed that the Muslims are sort of,
[03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:01.360]  you know how they do the divide and conquer thing.
[03:29:01.360 --> 03:29:03.360]  Well, the new thing is they put their hope
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:05.360]  and everything into the al-Qaeda groups.
[03:29:05.360 --> 03:29:08.360]  I talk a lot to a lot of them, and they seem to,
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:12.360]  you bring the facts for that Al-Qaeda is really run by CIA,
[03:29:12.360 --> 03:29:15.360]  but they've already put all their faith and all their hope into it,
[03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:18.360]  and bin Laden's their hero, and they don't want to hear anything else.
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:22.360]  Well, that's why when Bandar Bush, the Sultan, would be on TV,
[03:29:22.360 --> 03:29:25.360]  the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, he would defend al-Qaeda,
[03:29:25.360 --> 03:29:28.360]  even though they were launching an attack on Iraq, their enemy,
[03:29:28.360 --> 03:29:31.360]  when the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia,
[03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:33.360]  because they had to have him rockstar over there
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:35.360]  because they were getting it ready to be the hero
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:38.360]  of the al-Qaeda brigade to take over all the other countries
[03:29:38.360 --> 03:29:41.360]  and for the U.S. government to give them all the weapons, absolutely.
[03:29:41.360 --> 03:29:44.360]  And people just like their faith in Obama,
[03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:47.360]  some Muslims that like al-Qaeda, they just can't admit they're wrong
[03:29:47.360 --> 03:29:50.360]  because they just feel too good to be part of the system.
[03:29:50.360 --> 03:29:53.360]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.360 --> 03:29:55.360]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[03:29:55.360 --> 03:30:18.360]  Right for us. Sunday Radio Shelf House.
