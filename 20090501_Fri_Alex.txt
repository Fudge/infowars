[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:40.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it always takes time to begin to
[00:40.240 --> 00:46.840]  get a clear picture of what government or different corporations different organizations are doing
[00:46.840 --> 00:56.160]  I knew that this was a psi-op from the very beginning starting last week and now I'm more
[00:56.160 --> 01:04.360]  sure than ever this is a complete government hoax just like the 1976 swine flu outbreak at a US
[01:04.360 --> 01:11.360]  military base just like the 1918 broke out of US military base and they said basically this is
[01:11.360 --> 01:15.600]  the end of the world this is going to kill tens of millions of people you've got to take the shots
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.360]  and the flu killed no one but the shots killed a bunch of people and that's on record but we have
[01:22.360 --> 01:30.000]  seen massive military takeover drills real military checkpoints from Tennessee to California FEMA
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.160]  drills coinciding for the last three weeks into the next two weeks in every county every city
[01:35.160 --> 01:39.960]  for a flu outbreak that's a big article we should do I've got them all here in the stacks from
[01:39.960 --> 01:45.080]  the last few weeks where we kept seeing FEMA doing drills and the news showing how FEMA was
[01:45.080 --> 01:52.640]  doing drills for a massive flu pandemic and preparing mass graves and setting it up with
[01:52.640 --> 01:57.640]  the cemeteries and getting ready for martial law and quarantine and scaring the police and
[01:57.640 --> 02:04.280]  getting everybody ready for federal control and then magically boom there's a few deaths in Mexico
[02:04.280 --> 02:10.080]  and the Fair Maung ring begins there's been one death in the US they're now saying 12 deaths some
[02:10.080 --> 02:16.680]  say seven nine 12 whatever less than 20 deaths they've tested the other couple hundred dead
[02:16.680 --> 02:22.400]  people and it's pneumonia the common cold kills hundreds and hundreds and hundreds any day of
[02:22.400 --> 02:30.400]  the week in Mexico City of 30 plus million people biggest city in the world and when it's
[02:30.400 --> 02:37.640]  flu season you might have thousands dying in a week in Mexico City you've got thousands
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.320]  dying at the peak of the flu season in just a few weeks here in the United States 30 plus
[02:42.320 --> 02:50.200]  million every time I said I get emails going you said you know you said there was 28 million or
[02:50.200 --> 02:57.120]  there was 35 million whatever folks they debate the number of people in Mexico City was it 28
[02:57.120 --> 03:03.280]  million metro according to the CIA fact book and 35 million total with the suburbs whatever you got
[03:03.280 --> 03:10.080]  30 plus million people crowded in there of course you're gonna have in the last few weeks hundreds
[03:10.080 --> 03:14.760]  of deaths from pneumonia and regular colds they have a lot of respiratory problems down there
[03:14.760 --> 03:22.960]  meanwhile you can debate whether it's 15,000 or 35,000 deaths a year it gyrates in the United
[03:22.960 --> 03:30.360]  States let's just say it's thousands and thousands from flu every year meanwhile one death and

[08:30.200 --> 08:42.280]  but i hope i'm right i'm really becoming confident that this is absolutely completely
[08:42.280 --> 08:49.000]  a massive criminal hoax on the part of the charlatans that run our planet another psychological
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.400]  operation you have the tea parties that are bipartisan 98 percent of americans in major
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.200]  polls thousand to one phone calls to congress against the bank or takeover the banks are
[09:02.200 --> 09:07.080]  getting ready to take trillions and trillions more they're stealing over a trillion five hundred
[09:07.080 --> 09:19.800]  billion a month the american people are upset about the mike report in the department of
[09:19.800 --> 09:25.080]  homeland security reports sing ron paul supporters libertarians gun owners people buying ammo
[09:25.080 --> 09:31.080]  returning veterans are the number one enemy of homeland security and that the federal government
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.440]  exists to basically suppress the american people that was spreading like wildfire the left was
[09:36.440 --> 09:44.600]  waking up the the spell they're under was uh wavering for a moment when they noticed that he
[09:44.600 --> 09:51.800]  was expanding the wars in iraq and afghanistan that he was protecting bush on torture on secret
[09:51.800 --> 09:59.720]  arrest on rendition on camps that he was saying if you follow orders it's okay saying the nazis
[09:59.720 --> 10:10.440]  were right nurenberg and the allies were wrong his numbers were in freefall dropping as many as
[10:10.440 --> 10:18.360]  five points last week and then along comes a crisis so the government can grandstand and save us
[10:18.360 --> 10:25.080]  it doesn't matter if the army's own documents and mainstream news admits that tamo flew the
[10:25.080 --> 10:31.640]  antiviral drug doesn't help you with the flu they have armed convoys of national garden police
[10:31.640 --> 10:38.680]  all over the news guarding it they have suddenly tv shows produced months ago air on every channel
[10:38.680 --> 10:44.840]  i've confirmed at least five where people go to jail for not taking vaccines uh in different
[10:44.840 --> 10:54.120]  dramas and people are fighting over uh flu shots but only the ceo's get it under infra guard and
[10:54.120 --> 10:58.600]  and and so it's the elute you know the illusion of oh i've got a fight to get it on the sitcoms with
[10:58.600 --> 11:03.640]  the american idol crowd you know watching tv thinking oh i wish i could get the shot trying
[11:03.640 --> 11:10.280]  to create a a a artificial run on what i call the christmas toy phenomenon as you know they've
[11:10.280 --> 11:16.520]  caught company staging fights for news cameras for a toy then they put it on the news you know
[11:16.520 --> 11:21.880]  that the channel will be owned by a subsidiary of the toy company and then it becomes a national
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.960]  story and then everybody's fighting and killing and paying ten thousand dollars you know for a
[11:26.600 --> 11:31.640]  hundred dollar toy i've got to have the tamo blue i've got to have the bird flu shot i've
[11:31.640 --> 11:36.840]  got to have the swine flu shot i want it right now i've got to have mask i've got to it's all over
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.480]  we're dead what is the government going to do save us save us
[11:44.360 --> 11:51.240]  but because the bio weapon release in 1918 with vaccinated soldiers at us military bases killed
[11:51.240 --> 11:57.640]  40 plus million people because the globalist have weaponized abola because they've weaponized
[11:57.640 --> 12:03.400]  foot and mouth because they've built 36 level four bio weapons labs across the country because
[12:03.400 --> 12:10.120]  they're openly been caught sterilizing people and injecting people and killing people in thousands
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.040]  of chemical and biological and radiological tests we have to take it serious when they come out and
[12:16.040 --> 12:20.680]  they say this could be a pandemic and now they're saying it's going to be a pandemic that just means
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.920]  that five nations have it different regions have it a pandemic i mean there's a pandemics every
[12:27.720 --> 12:33.240]  fall and every winter and every spring when people have colds or the flu a pandemic just
[12:33.240 --> 12:41.720]  means a large portion of people get it and so they've gone to level six i told you that
[12:42.600 --> 12:50.280]  wednesday they're now in roiders yesterday and today saying yes we're about to go to level six now
[12:54.600 --> 13:01.080]  there is a no doubt that this is a distraction for the real crisis christler going bankrupt
[13:01.080 --> 13:08.760]  yesterday going into receivership i've got a chrysler vehicle in that nice chrysler vehicles
[13:08.760 --> 13:16.920]  dodge and others are all over the roads gm's going to go bankrupt they're going to shut that down
[13:16.920 --> 13:21.080]  in the next few months and it's going into globalist receivership it'll be handed off
[13:21.080 --> 13:26.760]  to belterberg group members just like the owner of fiat he's in the film in game blueprint for
[13:26.760 --> 13:33.320]  global enslavement we got video in istanbul chairman of fiat owner of fiat is one of the top
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.320]  belterberg group members and it's just going to be handed to them in bankruptcy court they're
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.280]  going to chop general motors up in little pieces and give a piece to this company a piece of that
[13:42.280 --> 13:45.880]  company they're going to give them bailout money to move to brazil
[13:50.680 --> 13:56.040]  mexico is going under the waves this came right at a perfect time as the drug war flared up
[13:56.040 --> 14:01.320]  as the people are on the verge of rebellion most analysts were saying mexico could fall this summer
[14:02.040 --> 14:09.240]  and a perfect unifying effect comes oh my god you might die and they say 100 dead 200 dead and then
[14:09.240 --> 14:12.360]  oh it's only seven dead
[14:15.800 --> 14:21.240]  but meanwhile they're just warming up here with the fear mongering shutting down schools here and
[14:21.240 --> 14:27.560]  there all across the nation incredible amount of schools closed in texas california new york
[14:30.360 --> 14:33.960]  and then i'm being attacked by cnn
[14:33.960 --> 14:53.720]  and what's the other one ms nbc ms nbc is attacking me today so i'm going to go over
[14:53.720 --> 15:06.840]  all the martial law news and what they're pushing here in a moment but i'm seeing this more and
[15:06.840 --> 15:13.160]  more there was a cnn piece killing the conspiracy theorist website prisonplanet.com saying it's a
[15:13.160 --> 15:19.160]  genetically engineered virus but that's ridiculous all the experts say it's not and that was yesterday
[15:19.160 --> 15:25.240]  front page of cnn of course there's experts and virologists and doctors all over the world all
[15:25.240 --> 15:29.720]  over foreign news major newspaper saying this is clearly engineered came out of the wrong
[15:29.720 --> 15:34.760]  hemisphere wrong time of year these viruses have pedigrees like if you own a french bulldog
[15:35.640 --> 15:41.000]  or you own a doberman or you own a mastiff or you own a chihuahua and it's got papers
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.520]  they know who the great great granddaddy was and they know who is great great granddaddy was well
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.760]  these viruses it would take at least a decade i was on there with a virologist yesterday on press
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.840]  tv he was saying oh take a decade to develop something like this yeah where is it they don't
[15:54.840 --> 16:01.720]  have a pedigree on it it's a super virus but only super and then it has a long incubation period
[16:01.720 --> 16:06.920]  sheds for a long time and clearly does infect a large portion of people to get it but it's extremely
[16:06.920 --> 16:16.200]  mild if you're a hemophiliac child prematurely born it may be able to kill you because you don't
[16:16.200 --> 16:21.240]  have much of an immune system and because you got tiny lungs and you're sick and that's who this
[16:21.240 --> 16:29.400]  stuff's killing well a common cold kills him too now what's scary is napolitano said well
[16:29.400 --> 16:33.000]  this may peter out in a couple weeks but the next one's coming soon it's going to be the big one
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.920]  one and i agree with them this is a beta test they've been beta testing their federalization
[16:38.920 --> 16:44.280]  look at how they announced last week oh we're just federalizing the state police in arizona and
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.520]  all these other cities are getting rid of their police forces and saying the u.s army will be
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.760]  their police force and it's connected to new york and oh the army's in tennessee the governor says
[16:52.760 --> 16:58.120]  well you can't run checkpoints here what are you doing shut up governor we're doing it but then
[16:58.120 --> 17:04.920]  it's in the newspaper the army's out in the air forces out running checkpoints and they just
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.360]  announced yeah we're gonna keep smiling everybody and yeah we're gonna take control of the internet
[17:08.360 --> 17:12.680]  and the pentagon says we're gonna start cyber attacking websites that criticizes inside the
[17:12.680 --> 17:19.000]  u.s is openly announcing incredible felonies and now they're attacking us no doubt it's them
[17:20.040 --> 17:26.600]  we've analyzed the attack and this is this is sick you guys most of the military are great folks
[17:26.600 --> 17:29.960]  that's why they've been listed as terrorist they know the biggest candidate they got the most money
[17:29.960 --> 17:34.840]  of barack obama or anybody was ron paul from the military and so you've been listed as terrorist
[17:34.840 --> 17:39.240]  but they got these control freaks they hire and they've got working for the military and private
[17:39.240 --> 17:43.720]  contractors that are attacking us and others and you know they're they're working for the bankers
[17:43.720 --> 17:48.920]  they had a top congressman come out yesterday it's in my stack and say the the congress is owned by
[17:48.920 --> 17:55.880]  foreign banks of course the country has had a corporate criminal hijacking and they know you're
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.840]  waking up they can see that it's building up towards their arrest them going to jail the people
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.440]  waking up overthrowing the new world order getting america back and so they're gonna create bird flu
[18:06.440 --> 18:10.920]  scares and swine flu scares and if we really start getting ready to get rid of them they'll release
[18:10.920 --> 18:15.000]  the real thing folks and clamp down martial law and say we're not clamping down martial law because
[18:15.000 --> 18:22.760]  of the demonstrations we're doing it because you know two billion people have died we're seeing
[18:22.760 --> 18:32.040]  right now what their response is going to be this is a beta test no doubt i'm i'm 99 percent sure of
[18:32.040 --> 18:38.120]  it now as i said last week i was 95 percent sure this was a hoax now i'm getting to be almost 100
[18:38.120 --> 18:44.440]  percent but listen to this i mean swine flu outbreak racism goes viral and yesterday decided to
[18:44.440 --> 18:53.400]  attack msnbc alex jones this is the new tactic they have a white supremacist goes on the site says
[18:53.400 --> 18:59.720]  he doesn't like me because i'm not racist doesn't matter within hours of that guy killing three
[18:59.720 --> 19:05.560]  cops and shooting a couple more in pittsburgh the southern poverty law center basically the cia
[19:06.120 --> 19:11.640]  but admitted that's who they work with they get from the police his full surfing record now public
[19:11.640 --> 19:17.320]  fox seeing in everybody drudge report you name it and they decide to go after alex jones and say
[19:17.320 --> 19:21.080]  he was a big fan of alex jones and they have so-called friends pop up on tv right away and
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.320]  say it then it turns out he hated me and was attacking me and they hit me with that because
[19:25.320 --> 19:32.280]  i'm saying arrest the bankers folks well in this article it goes after me and it says
[19:34.040 --> 19:39.640]  that's tepid compared to some of the xenophobic reactions spreading like an emerging virus
[19:39.640 --> 19:45.160]  across the internet see we're the virus the disgusting blight is because mexicans are pigs

[24:42.360 --> 24:49.320]  margaret sanger errors the errors of margaret sanger they always race pimp and so i mean i
[24:49.320 --> 24:56.520]  guess you could go on an msnbc forum and call uh chinese people bad names and then say oh msnbc
[24:57.320 --> 25:03.880]  uh doesn't like chinese people i mean it's it's it's the most petty guilty association but it's a
[25:03.880 --> 25:11.240]  good thing they're doing this because they've worn themselves out nobody buys this race stuff
[25:11.240 --> 25:17.160]  anymore they have so overused it's so over pushed it everybody knows that it's the establishment
[25:17.160 --> 25:24.360]  the big corporations you know msnbc is partially owned by general electric and several other big
[25:24.360 --> 25:31.080]  bomb makers who drop cluster bombs on brown people uh all over the world and of course white people

[25:54.280 --> 25:57.240]  let's see they want to keep everybody divided
[25:59.400 --> 26:07.000]  and it says uh i mean they quote a forum that has millions of posts on it millions of posts
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.000]  and uh i bet if we could track this this is probably uh southern property law center or
[26:13.000 --> 26:18.760]  somebody this disgusting blight is because mexicans are pigs an anonymous poster ran
[26:18.760 --> 26:25.960]  it on the prison plan forum part of radio host columnist alex jones website see they
[26:25.960 --> 26:30.280]  don't have anything me anything i've said bad about mexicans
[26:30.280 --> 26:36.200]  said bad about mexicans so they want to make this a racial issue i'll never forget
[26:36.200 --> 26:40.600]  whenever all these communist spies were in the us under clinton and there were all these murders
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.200]  going on and and they were handing over the you name it panamoc canal you name it and
[26:46.200 --> 26:51.480]  they would be seeing in pieces going are these groups racist is bill dirts at the washington
[26:51.480 --> 26:57.160]  times racist against chinese people that'd be like if we had german spies during world war two in
[26:57.160 --> 27:04.040]  the u.s are you against germans it's the same thing if you criticize israel the israeli lobby
[27:04.040 --> 27:10.760]  will try to make it about race or religion what you don't like jews then they'll mix in legitimate
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.600]  criticism even jews and israel that disagree there oh what you don't like jews you're a self-hating
[27:16.600 --> 27:21.880]  jew i mean again this is injecting the issue and then all the racist and people out there they
[27:21.880 --> 27:29.000]  certainly play into the trap um and even attack michael savage here they say michael savage
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.120]  speculated that terrors using mexican immigrants as walking germ weapons it would be easy he said
[27:34.120 --> 27:39.000]  to bring an altered virus into mexico put it in the general population and have them march
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.600]  across the border of course it's been uh charles key alan keys excuse me they're gonna charles
[27:44.600 --> 27:51.960]  key out of oklahoma alan keys has come out rightfully so and made the point that uh they could uh he
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.600]  thinks obama will stage terror attacks to bring in martial law absolutely they're finally getting it
[27:56.600 --> 28:02.280]  michael savage has said that including a bio attack said that about a month ago he said several
[28:02.280 --> 28:08.680]  statements along those lines so he's got to be demonized now and of course you've got to speculate
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.480]  the government's been asked that in press conferences over and over again is this a bio attack
[28:13.480 --> 28:18.840]  did somebody put this in mexico but when mainstream news asked homeland security this in press
[28:18.840 --> 28:23.720]  conferences oh it's normal and okay but when michael savage gets a call about it and speculates
[28:23.720 --> 28:27.160]  it's because he's a racist and they sandwiched that in
[28:29.960 --> 28:33.400]  they sandwiched that in with somebody at the prison planet forum
[28:35.240 --> 28:40.280]  you know people are emailing me panicking yesterday going have you banned have you banned

[34:36.120 --> 34:42.760]  cbs news story that's out of cbs saying they're preparing for martial law forced inoculations
[34:42.760 --> 34:46.360]  they're just saying you're going to be forcibly injected that they're going to quarantine whole
[34:46.360 --> 34:50.520]  cities county states if need be but the border is going to stay wide open i mean they're really
[34:50.520 --> 34:57.880]  worried about this why is the border staying wide open if they're seeing any vector you know first
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.840]  they said last weekend in the sunday briefing they said we're going to leave the border open
[35:02.840 --> 35:09.240]  because it's already spread from the biggest vector supposedly mexico but then we may have to
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.160]  lock down america and it says right here mainstream news i got fox singing in we're going to play the
[35:13.160 --> 35:21.080]  clips later martial law is good martial law is coming level six i confirmed two days ago we're
[35:21.080 --> 35:25.080]  really at level six now last night today they're saying we're going to go to level six which is
[35:25.080 --> 35:29.160]  complete and total martial law now does that mean they're going to implement it i don't know
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.400]  is this a beta test to test the locals going under their control why are they announcing
[35:33.400 --> 35:39.400]  different state police are now merging with the feds permanently dr linard horowitz pioneered
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.760]  exposing all of this he's with us about 20 minutes 15 minutes into the next hour and i really
[35:44.760 --> 35:49.960]  respect him because back in uh... before the anthrax case was out and he wrote the articles
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.880]  these are on record he said the government was going to launch anthrax attack because he saw
[35:53.880 --> 35:59.160]  their propaganda on the news knew the companies involved this amazing mind of a harvard graduate
[35:59.160 --> 36:05.000]  you know several doctorates uh... in medicine psychology you name it so we saw it happening
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.400]  these are psychologists and psychiatrists running this show it takes one to beat one i guess it takes
[36:09.400 --> 36:13.640]  one to know what he can see what they're doing i saw that before nine eleven as well the preparation
[36:13.640 --> 36:16.520]  how they were introducing the enemy how they were getting it ready and i said they'll probably blow
[36:16.520 --> 36:21.000]  up the world trade center and blame it on the rest of the summit in london so he did something
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.880]  even more amazing he predicted specifically the anthrax attack then day one came out and exposed
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.720]  how congress had done a try a funding to practice mailing weaponized anthrax to the mail he fingered
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.040]  the very group involved and then it came out the white house was on sypro before nine eleven
[36:36.040 --> 36:41.000]  september tenth that it was bush's enemies that were mailed it and the fb i came and harassed him
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.960]  in his house and product like he was involved in it because he was so spot on being able to predict
[36:45.960 --> 36:51.400]  it now he's come out again saying this is a designer virus but that it was probably just
[36:51.400 --> 36:56.200]  something to sell vaccines to scare people because it's got to be designer so companies
[36:56.200 --> 37:00.360]  can then come out quickly with the vaccine and several companies are saying they're going to
[37:00.360 --> 37:05.080]  have it in like a week or something with this weird reverse clone now i'm not saying they've
[37:05.080 --> 37:09.720]  done that i i don't have the crystal ball brain that the doctor horowitz does but i wanted to get
[37:09.720 --> 37:15.880]  him on to talk about the history of what the globalist have done the eugenesis because he
[37:15.880 --> 37:21.240]  hasn't talked about that in a while you know the history then the latest and then the big issue of
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.800]  they're using this mind control this hoax this this this this fire in a theater there is no fire
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.160]  probably but the yelling fire causes the trampling the deaths like a rolling stone concert where
[37:33.160 --> 37:39.080]  hundreds could die and the police state this happening right when the economy is imploding
[37:39.080 --> 37:42.920]  right when the worst numbers are coming out right when it's clear they're trying to pass
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.880]  global taxes and set up the new bank of the world in carbon taxes and gun bills
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.240]  dr horowitz joining us via skype from southern california we appreciate him taking time out
[37:53.240 --> 37:59.160]  to join us tetrahedron.org and we'll give you several of his other sites thanks for coming on
[37:59.160 --> 38:05.720]  with us sir thank you alex you know there's a one thing only that i would add to your very thorough
[38:05.720 --> 38:14.600]  and very intelligent analysis and that is that the fright could be also additionally a cover
[38:14.600 --> 38:22.840]  a distraction for exactly what dr james robertson and the dr woods and the other doctors who are
[38:22.840 --> 38:30.360]  involved at the highest levels of administering the global response to the flus they have already
[38:30.360 --> 38:38.520]  decided that they would lose flu type viruses recombinance mutants to seed the population
[38:38.520 --> 38:45.640]  this may be a cover a covert operation to literally infect people with this what they
[38:45.640 --> 38:54.280]  initially called biosimilars or these mutant mutant files that they call dr horowitz we had
[38:54.280 --> 38:59.560]  you on twice via video uplink it's like 2001 space odyssey where you make the call and get
[38:59.560 --> 39:04.520]  somebody on video phones folks know and then murphy's law or whatever as soon as we go to you it's
[39:04.520 --> 39:08.360]  horrible scrambled audio we're gonna try to reconnect right now that doesn't collect a connect
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.360]  clean we're gonna get you back on the phone we'll hold you over if need be to make sure you get the
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.240]  time we're honored to have you because i want to hear this specifically yes he sent me these royal
[39:18.680 --> 39:25.880]  commission royal academy documents i haven't heard my stack shilling documents where the
[39:26.520 --> 39:33.560]  had individuals who get the supposedly deadly bird flu and other strains from government
[39:33.560 --> 39:40.200]  to then be seeded out to vaccine companies where they're talking about priming the public with these
[39:40.200 --> 39:46.920]  and putting them out and and and me it's really shocking what it says so we'll get him as somebody
[39:46.920 --> 39:55.480]  who's been studying this to interpret these documents for us here on the air so that is coming
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.320]  up if i didn't know he was going to bring up those documents i've got them somewhere here in my stack
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.240]  but but he can read those for himself in fact he emailed he emailed me those again the other day
[40:05.240 --> 40:11.880]  we asked rob do to print me the last email it's an attachment from the british royal society
[40:11.880 --> 40:21.720]  it's the royal society mat we asked rob do to uh to uh go print me that because the stack gets
[40:21.720 --> 40:26.280]  so big so quickly while we're waiting to get dr horror was connected again let's play this fox
[40:26.280 --> 40:31.640]  news clips we can analyze it uh guys go ahead and play this fox news clip are we able to do that now
[40:31.640 --> 40:39.000]  we have horror was connected or as horror was back okay yeah here is the fox clip where they're
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.480]  talking about marshal law where they're talking about forced inoculations and then it's all over
[40:43.480 --> 40:49.400]  the news this is being introduced to us now but here's the key to all this the border is going
[40:49.400 --> 40:54.120]  to stay wide open with the main vector that's the globalist system but we have to lock down
[40:54.120 --> 41:01.160]  cities and towns in in america so the border stays open but you can't come out of your house and
[41:01.160 --> 41:07.560]  we're gonna forcibly inoculate even if you aren't sick here it is the world health organization
[41:07.560 --> 41:12.600]  raised now the pandemic alert for swine flu to the second highest level level five right now
[41:12.600 --> 41:17.400]  mexico has implemented quarantines and world leaders issuing travel warnings but of course
[41:17.400 --> 41:24.040]  it could get worse that's right if it becomes a pandemic you could lose some simple rights like
[41:24.040 --> 41:29.240]  going to the movies fox news legal analyst peter johnson jr joins us live here as well uh
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.000]  peter as we do the president of the states is talking with a good connection for now
[41:33.640 --> 41:36.840]  we'll we'll finish this clip up later where they openly say marshal law
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.360]  dr horowitz i want to go back to what you were saying but but first can you answer the question
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.480]  if you've been studying this uh you know as a doctor and somebody who's studied how pandemic
[41:45.480 --> 41:51.800]  spread if you are saying leave the border open with mexico that and this is really so deadly
[41:51.800 --> 41:57.320]  but leave the border open but then we're gonna lock down the u.s cities this is obvious that
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.120]  this is a train the american people how to be uh in lockdown nazi germany isn't it
[42:02.840 --> 42:07.960]  yes it is and as i've mentioned before this could also be a covert operation to actually
[42:07.960 --> 42:13.480]  see the population because now the news is coming out that the virus is not particularly
[42:13.480 --> 42:19.800]  uh you know deadly it's really not relatively mild and that's exactly what the recombinant
[42:19.800 --> 42:27.160]  was that the group at uh the world health organization the the organization that uh
[42:27.160 --> 42:31.800]  james robertson as well as the nova vax publications we're talking about
[42:31.800 --> 42:36.040]  you know again at the most incriminating issue that i think has not been covered is the decision
[42:36.040 --> 42:41.880]  that was made already to lose these kinds of laboratory creations that would uh see the
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.320]  population in advance of pandemics and so it could be like you've been saying a covert operation
[42:47.320 --> 42:53.960]  in that regard okay dutter horitz explain to people uh can you read to them from that uh british uh
[42:53.960 --> 43:01.240]  uh academy that you in document that you've sent me that it's officially off their side
[43:01.240 --> 43:06.200]  where they're talking about priming the public getting them ready it's it's a very very chilling
[43:06.200 --> 43:13.960]  what does that mean well it means that essentially that besides doing all the business and of
[43:14.600 --> 43:21.000]  bio preparedness and protection of the world's population the most advanced uh experts they
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.000]  call them in the field of infectious disease have already decided that they would lose viruses
[43:27.000 --> 43:34.120]  that they would produce in their labs that would go out and infect the population in advance of a
[43:34.120 --> 43:41.000]  you know in advance of the big one in advance of the real like spanish flu 1918 that they would do
[43:41.000 --> 43:48.280]  that allegedly in defense of the population and allegedly for bio preparedness and allegedly
[43:48.280 --> 43:54.040]  because it's doing exactly what this current epidemic is doing or this pandemic is doing
[43:54.040 --> 44:01.880]  that is it's a mild exposure to a potentially lethal pathogen and they have decided behind closed
[44:01.880 --> 44:08.600]  doors in bed with the drug industrialists that they're going to do this to unwitting populations
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.520]  without having any informed consent so this is really you're saying could be a mass inoculation
[44:14.520 --> 44:19.880]  or at least that's their excuse to do this they claim that they've weakened the pathogen
[44:20.840 --> 44:26.360]  to then release it into the public to protect us down the road from a real bird flu that's
[44:26.360 --> 44:33.080]  exactly that's my number one best call based on all the evidence and on top of that you have to
[44:33.080 --> 44:40.040]  understand the psyops already administered has made billions and billions of dollars and further
[44:40.040 --> 44:46.840]  advance the police state the fascism and the application of the model state emergency health
[44:46.840 --> 44:54.680]  powers act that allows for the incarceration of populations putting them into these quarantine
[44:54.680 --> 45:00.840]  virtually concentration camps injecting infecting and intoxicating drugging them with whatever the
[45:00.840 --> 45:08.200]  public health professionals in their actual manchurian candidate hypnotics trance state that
[45:08.200 --> 45:14.760]  is induced by standard cult and doctor nation methods in medical education continuing medical
[45:14.760 --> 45:21.640]  education and this whole pseudo scientific process of literally creating brainwashed mind control
[45:21.640 --> 45:27.400]  slaves of the military medical petrochemical pharmaceutical cartel that's what's going on
[45:27.400 --> 45:35.320]  alex all right up on screen we have the royal society the academy of medical sciences and
[45:35.320 --> 45:40.520]  its summary of oral evidence dr john wood and dr james robertson national institute for biological
[45:40.520 --> 45:50.680]  standards and controls n i b s c and on the last page it says use of live viruses scroll down to
[45:50.680 --> 45:54.200]  the bottom of the document for me gentlemen thank you for present planet dot tv viewers
[45:54.760 --> 46:01.320]  dr wood and robertson were asked their opinion of priming the population for a pandemic using live
[46:01.320 --> 46:07.400]  vaccines and if they consider it to be a good idea however the timing is critical if live h5
[46:07.400 --> 46:13.640]  n1 vaccines are used now will be considered too dangerous but if a pandemic is imminent the risk
[46:13.640 --> 46:20.760]  may be justified a stockpile of live vaccine with the cleavage site removed could be used as a to
[46:20.760 --> 46:28.600]  prime the population in advance of the pandemic reaching the uk even without an exact match in a
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.320]  virus strain now what does that mean i mean they love to kind of read between the lines
[46:33.320 --> 46:39.000]  there are state stuff and the obvious but what does it mean prime the population with a live virus
[46:39.000 --> 46:47.240]  well this is exactly notice you said the cleavage site or some aspect of the virus removed and what
[46:47.240 --> 46:53.960]  may be happening is that this outbreak because of the advance you have to understand biological
[46:53.960 --> 46:59.080]  biodefense biomilitary operations are 10 years more advanced than what is commercial
[47:00.920 --> 47:08.280]  you know commercialization and standard consumption in the marketplace so these guys if they have been
[47:08.280 --> 47:13.880]  actually publishing this they're the covert science labs are 10 years at least maybe 15
[47:13.880 --> 47:19.400]  ahead which means that what you're describing in that document is precisely what's being
[47:19.400 --> 47:25.720]  described of this virus of this pathogen they're claiming is the cause of this pandemic it is
[47:25.720 --> 47:32.600]  not quite human it's got some human parts it's got some avian parts apparently it's got uh
[47:32.600 --> 47:39.240]  you know or swine parts and it has cross reaction when you understand and you read the science
[47:39.240 --> 47:45.960]  that has been published by cdc and nova vax you you understand that they have cross reactiveness
[47:45.960 --> 47:54.440]  that in other words if you expose a population to a mutated virus weaken it but just enough to
[47:54.440 --> 48:01.800]  cause immunity and then add enough of the different strains such as the swine flu the avian flu the
[48:01.800 --> 48:07.560]  spanish flu put it all together and then you expose the population to that even prime the
[48:07.560 --> 48:14.200]  population is what they're talking about by some form of method of vaccination now can you imagine
[48:14.200 --> 48:22.040]  what the what the outrage of the public would be if they were told that they're not a now must go get
[48:22.040 --> 48:29.160]  vaccinated against a pandemic that hasn't happened yet well speaking of priming they are now openly
[48:29.160 --> 48:34.680]  on every major publication in tv saying you may have to take a shot even if you're not sick
[48:34.680 --> 48:37.880]  and we're going to lock your towns and cities we're going to have the feds come out with the police
[48:37.880 --> 48:42.600]  and do this while the border is wide open i mean so so they're really trying to separate
[48:42.600 --> 48:47.960]  whether they're moving this time or not they're now introducing the idea think about it they may
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.520]  already have done it and what they're simply doing now is a psychological operation that you
[48:53.240 --> 49:01.160]  consistently have always been accurate about telling the public about amazing so where do you
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.760]  see this going from here well i i praise the creator for the fact that this thing is not as
[49:06.760 --> 49:13.480]  severe as we thought it might be i i praise the creator for the fact that we may have some time
[49:13.480 --> 49:20.440]  left to to reverse the fascism and the manipulation and intoxication of the population through the
[49:20.440 --> 49:27.080]  decimation through through the dissemination of truth basically what we need to do is get the truth
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.520]  such as those documents that you've just thank you so much alex for putting that document up
[49:32.520 --> 49:40.040]  on the air because this is the kind of inside research and discussions and backroom deals
[49:40.040 --> 49:47.400]  that we the public need to expose in order to come to some level of intelligent decision making
[49:47.400 --> 49:53.960]  because we have got to if we if this has got to be about sovereignty spirituality and informed consent
[49:53.960 --> 49:59.480]  we have got to give our consent i mean there's a separation of church and state just a big battle
[49:59.480 --> 50:06.600]  right now as far as i can see is this whole attack on christianity attack on spirituality
[50:06.600 --> 50:12.440]  that we now the gods of science and medicine dictate to you what is going to be injected
[50:12.440 --> 50:19.000]  inspected and intoxicated in your holy spirit filled temple i am telling you i am absolutely
[50:19.560 --> 50:26.920]  certain to be here to the very end this is an issue that shall never go away we shall always

[50:32.120 --> 50:39.480]  say i don't care what fox news has to say everyone who considers them either a christian jew or muslim
[50:39.480 --> 50:46.200]  has a sovereign spirit right to resist vaccination dr horowitz stay there absolutely and and i want
[50:46.200 --> 50:52.520]  to bring up the new the new vaccines they admit they have that quote cure you of drug abuse they
[50:52.520 --> 50:58.200]  admit it literally eats brain cells and eats the receptor sites and the more advanced vaccines
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.640]  they give you that literally re-engineered the brain to make you a zombie spring is here growing

[54:15.800 --> 54:21.560]  what's happening alan watt to come on give us his view of this whole fear mongering sigh up
[54:22.200 --> 54:27.640]  and then niles a herit one of the nano thermite experts exposing the fact that that was found
[54:27.640 --> 54:32.760]  in the wtc rubble more and more peer reviewed scientific reports coming out they have one of
[54:32.760 --> 54:39.000]  the heads of the 911 commission come out a month ago and say that they staged a meeting before the
[54:39.000 --> 54:44.360]  event before the commission with the military to lie about the stand down that's now mainstream news
[54:44.360 --> 54:49.960]  this stuff is all unraveling dr. Horowitz there's these whole classes as you know but i want you
[54:49.960 --> 54:57.560]  to tell the listeners about them of new vaccines that quote cure mental illness they go in and
[54:57.560 --> 55:03.080]  attack certain areas of the brain it's like programmed nano tech viruses is how i would describe
[55:03.080 --> 55:09.480]  it and they go in and they eat the receptor sites for nicotine and heroin and cocaine and folks
[55:09.480 --> 55:14.600]  don't believe me just google new vaccine to cure drug addiction but then other scientists went
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.320]  wait a minute you won't be able to be happy anymore those those receptors are for natural
[55:19.320 --> 55:26.520]  endorphins and you know what you would say would be spirituality uh i mean when you talk about
[55:26.520 --> 55:33.080]  wanting to control our souls this is the next wave isn't it oh that's exactly what genito
[55:33.080 --> 55:39.560]  pharmaceuticals is all about alex this the whole concept of vaccination intoxication
[55:39.560 --> 55:45.080]  for population manipulation and decimation is really where the future of medicine they're
[55:45.080 --> 55:53.320]  heralding lies and so it becomes a literally a battle of nature versus laboratory you know and
[55:53.320 --> 55:58.520]  i'm personally choosing and i don't know too many people in my circle my friends my community
[55:58.520 --> 56:07.160]  that feels like we want to give all of nature over to the manipulators i think it's a hideous
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.360]  reality that we're looking at and if you look at the true science it's not science that they're
[56:12.360 --> 56:19.560]  giving us in fact it's actually pseudoscience there's nothing scientific about their proposition
[56:19.560 --> 56:28.040]  that this flu just happened to naturally land up in mexico where suddenly you know there's
[56:28.040 --> 56:33.080]  never been anything like it in history how did that happen and i also question what they're
[56:33.080 --> 56:38.600]  reporting at the world health organization uh which is really if you look study deeply the
[56:38.600 --> 56:46.120]  rockefeller disease surveillance system it was set up by the rockefellers now if people in the
[56:46.120 --> 56:51.400]  united states don't realize they're already working with if they're dealing with rockefellers
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.440]  they're working with traders against the united states that happened during world war two and
[56:56.440 --> 57:02.200]  history repeats itself when you don't learn history so literally america is being taken out now with
[57:02.200 --> 57:08.920]  a globalist agenda and at the forefront of biomedicine and genetics and eugenics and vaccination
[57:08.920 --> 57:15.080]  policy and this whole disease surveillance at the world health organization study it the origin of
[57:15.080 --> 57:21.080]  it is the rockefeller international global disease surveillance system i wrote about that in the
[57:21.080 --> 57:26.840]  book emerging viruses aids in ebola well you're absolutely right in fact we have all these medical
[57:26.840 --> 57:32.920]  doctors and scientists and historians on from wide ranging fields and they all come back to the
[57:32.920 --> 57:38.600]  same thing the rockefellers learn that most cancer was viral they learned how to put it the vaccines
[57:38.600 --> 57:44.520]  they've caught vaccine makers hundreds of times as you know being caught doing it and they think
[57:44.520 --> 57:49.240]  they're god with the gmo crops with the vaccines with all of it what are they going to do is the
[57:49.240 --> 57:54.760]  world refuses to go along with them they're going to stage pandemics in an attempt to scare us into
[57:54.760 --> 58:00.600]  going under their control that's exactly right so really it is a holy war it's a war against
[58:00.600 --> 58:05.320]  you know not flesh and blood with whom we do battle it's a spiritual warfare and when you
[58:05.320 --> 58:11.720]  understand what genetics really is it's water science what makes dna actually operate is the
[58:11.720 --> 58:17.800]  water molecules the structured water within the genetic strand and around it forming a matrix
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.680]  that receives and transmits light and sound signals so it's bio spiritual or bio energetic
[58:24.680 --> 58:30.200]  processing it's a virtual antenna to the creator and if you don't believe me read the brilliant
[58:30.200 --> 58:35.880]  research that's already come out that the authorities don't want you to see well that's why
[58:35.880 --> 58:51.400]  a lot of top atheist scientists are now saying there's something made this hello friends this is
[58:51.400 --> 58:55.880]  alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's
[58:55.880 --> 59:00.440]  more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have
[59:00.440 --> 59:04.840]  to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the superdome and
[59:04.840 --> 59:09.560]  beg for femur to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare no one is going
[59:09.560 --> 59:14.360]  to take care of your family in the final equation but you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to
[59:14.360 --> 59:19.240]  shift horrible food that's safe from ecoli salmonella genetic alteration or chinese imports
[59:19.240 --> 59:25.480]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices call 1-800-409-5633 or on
[59:25.480 --> 59:31.400]  the web go to efoodsdirect.com visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the final list of high quality

[59:45.320 --> 59:48.360]  take action today the first step is getting storable food
[59:48.360 --> 59:58.440]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:21.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:29.080]  you know we've seen all of these thousands of news reports over the years getting us ready for
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:34.200]  marshal law the police state and now this is just one more step in that but all over the news the
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:39.080]  biggest stepping out we've ever seen oh we're gonna lock down your cities we may have to lock down
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:43.400]  your towns we're gonna you know we're gonna give you orders we're gonna federalize things
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:47.080]  the federal government doing all these unconstitutional things we're gonna forcibly
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:52.120]  inoculate you just conditioning people and conditioning the local police to go under federal
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:56.440]  control to carry this out now they're gonna do it this time i don't know could this still be a deadly
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:03.240]  flu it may be but more and more it's looking like hype what an amazing crime by the media
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:10.120]  a few deaths in mexico one death in the u.s hyping it lying about it saying it was 200 150
[1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:19.160]  then having to back off of that some numbers say seven nine 12 this is amazing this is absolutely
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:25.240]  amazing meanwhile 300 plus thousand people die of bad drugner actions every year in the u.s alone
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:28.360]  that's the government's own admitted numbers it's probably worse horowitz would tell you
[1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:33.400]  him dr. Horowitz plugs some of your websites some of the work you're doing some of the
[1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.520]  events you've got coming up about getting folks together but also they don't want to continue
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:43.000]  with the basics for people you know what are you going to do if they try to forcibly inoculate
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.640]  you what are you going to do if they come try to lock down your town and then how crazy is it
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:51.800]  while the border still open i mean if they're really saying it's this deadly why leave the
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:59.080]  border open but then lock your towns down well the solution is where i'm focusing it's i believe
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:06.840]  we have a tremendous opportunity to help humanity maximally in live h2o concert for the living water
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:12.840]  it's coming up june 19th of the 21st internationally i've been working for two years that's why you
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:17.960]  haven't heard much about it or anything from me for about two years but when this flu thing happened
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:23.720]  i had to come out with something but go to live h2o dot org i've been taking a lot of heat when
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:29.880]  i put up that youtube thing that's gone viral i took a lot of heat for adding a little oxy
[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:35.960]  silver blurb at the end of it but you know what i will do it again because if people understood
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:43.080]  how simple healing is healing all of it happens because of the energy and the bio energetics
[1:02:43.080 --> 1:02:48.840]  coming out of water water science has the capacity now we are advanced to the level of knowledge
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:55.640]  with really hard wonderful science that shows how miraculous water can be used and can be used
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:00.600]  for virtually everything and the globalist and the globalists know that that's why they try to
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:05.720]  uh... poison the water in their own government documents so that we're toxic and poison and
[1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:11.240]  can't think right then they make dr strange love movies you know with making fun of us
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:15.320]  where the mad general knows they want to mess with his precious bodily fluids
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:22.120]  and so they are uh... you're trying to poison the fluids but their own documents you know people
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:26.840]  in labor camps as you know in soviet russia nancy germany they put fluoride in the water
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.920]  that's a pulled surprise winning history books mean this is real exactly water is the solution
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:38.760]  universal solvent for all the pollution is water and everything in the universe all healing is
[1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:45.000]  piezoelectric chemical reaction is based on electron flow all the electrons from the universe
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:50.280]  and ph part hydrogen so important for body chemistry to resist infectious diseases if the
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:54.840]  government was responsible they would be giving people the simple truth how to protect their
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:00.920]  body temples how to resist all these infectious diseases and the reality is all the hydrogen
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:09.080]  and ph part hydrogen are delivering the the element of the the electron which is the piezoelectricity
[1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:16.040]  of every universal energetic reaction so hydrogen fuels can be used from water literally hydrogen
[1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:21.720]  can be used to run our automobiles we don't need petrochemical pollution we don't need to
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:28.120]  this intoxication and likewise oxy silver the silver hydrocone i will do it again i will
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:33.720]  tell people always please go simply do the research because the truth shall set you free
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:39.240]  you don't need to poison yourself you don't need pop to pop magic pills to cure every ill you
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:45.560]  don't need to inject intoxicate yourself with vaccinations with foreign RNA DNA and proteins
[1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:51.000]  from bacteria virus fungus yeast chicken embryo bovine fetal serum stay there we got a break

[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:10.280]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's
[1:05:10.280 --> 1:05:14.920]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:19.320]  coming up we got bob shatman with all the latest economic news that's what this fear mongering uh over the
[1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:28.520]  swine flu has been and again it could still be bad i mean there's you know they're saying it's bad
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:33.240]  there we've got secret documents whether which have been proven to be accurate because then
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:37.720]  what these documents reported from the state from the feds here in texas ended up being announced
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:43.960]  days later that we're really at level six and it's killing all these people but there's no evidence of
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:48.920]  that and we've seen them in the past lie to the police the military and others even more they're
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:53.960]  saying we'll use the military will forcibly inject you will forcibly inoculate you uh
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:08:58.520]  um you know i think the jigs up that are horowitz even if they release a real bio weapon in the
[1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:04.680]  future or god forbid this one turns out to be bad people are so untrusting and so informed now
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:10.760]  on average more more waking up to the system and just how cold blooded these elitist are that i don't
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:15.240]  see them being successful in carrying this out i think they're starting to realize the tide has
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:20.040]  turned against them well i pray that that's the case and we're going to do continue to do everything
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:28.280]  in our power as long as we breathe to help people wake up and to protect life protect our sanctity
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:34.920]  our sovereignty our children our generations future generations uh it's gotta and and and again i have
[1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:40.120]  a wonderful plan by the grace of the creator i've been so blessed and uh people should go to
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:48.600]  www.liveh2o.org concert for the living water this coming june 19th of the 21st friday is the day
[1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:53.560]  about educating from the world's leading experts in the field of water water science how we can
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:10:01.000]  eliminate all the petrochemical pollution and waste and uh the toxicity from uh the vaccinations
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:06.200]  and antibiotics through the silver hydrosol such as oxy silver all the wonderful things that we
[1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:11.080]  can do with water through music and sound and understanding that water and literally who we
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:17.960]  are as human beings are vibrating resonating and the dna is actually activating it and that's the
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:22.360]  primary function of dna that they don't want to tell you about because they're making money off of
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:26.760]  humanity suffering that's why we're gonna have only one or two other questions i'm gonna let you
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:33.000]  go and get an update next week from dr horwitz we appreciate all your time specifically uh they're
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  reporting that baxter pharmaceutical and others um that uh some of their vaccines are grown in
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:45.560]  europe it's legal and more and more here it is on fetal tissue and then the all the reports that
[1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:50.680]  you're not just getting whatever the supposed pathogen that the vaccine is designed for
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:57.000]  it's all the other dna and viruses and things exactly in the the the the monkey kidneys or the
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:03.480]  dead babies uh and then even if it's the genetic stock that then that is then being grown on eggs
[1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:08.840]  or something later still it's from that original contaminant can you explain to folks what's in
[1:11:08.840 --> 1:11:17.400]  vaccines yes foreign rna foreign dna from bacteria virus fungus yeast chicken embryo bovine fetal
[1:11:17.400 --> 1:11:23.560]  serum monkey kidney tissues fetal tissues like you mentioned and then this is the growth medium
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:29.880]  so when you grow a virus on this medium some of the proteins come with it when it gets injected
[1:11:29.880 --> 1:11:35.400]  into your body or your children's bloodstreams it causes autoimmune reactions so all the whole
[1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:41.960]  host of autoimmune diseases chronic fatigue phobromyalgia lupus ms alessu lugaric disease
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:46.040]  chronic crippling rheumatoid arthritis adult and juvenile type one diabetes
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:51.160]  Crohn's disease gillian beret steven johnson syndrome bell's palsy the current plagues have
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:56.680]  been induced by the number one genocidal weapon it's called vaccination wake up
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:04.360]  for those that don't know you just put all that info out but on every one of those cases
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:11.800]  Crohn's disease gillian berets the mainstream government documents admit vaccines are doing it
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:18.200]  but they say it's for the greater good so it's all right yeah right yeah i'll tell you what you
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:25.400]  believe that i got a bridge you can buy and she was unbelievable this is propaganda and the reality
[1:12:25.400 --> 1:12:31.480]  is that sadly the ignorant people will go into fear instead of actually having the knowledge
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:36.280]  that the truth that shall set them free of the pharmaceutical toxicity they're choosing
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:41.960]  ignorance they're choosing to go along with this lunacy and this hypocrisy public health is not
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:47.640]  for you centers for disease control is actually centers for disease creation they're creating
[1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:52.840]  these germs they're in bed with the companies that are making the money off of humanity suffering
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:59.320]  that's standard strict definition of genocide all right dr. Lynn Horowitz we'll get a report
[1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:03.560]  after you've had your big event and have you back on the show we appreciate all your time
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:09.640]  we'll talk to you soon thanks alex b plus bye bye thank you what a great guy a very very interesting
[1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:14.680]  person very very intelligent and predicted so much accurately you have to you have to pay attention
[1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:19.480]  to what he has to say now coming up i'm going to play some of the news clips where they're saying
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:29.080]  martial law force inoculations lockdown of buildings homes neighborhoods towns cities
[1:13:29.080 --> 1:13:36.360]  county states nation uh they're now introducing this to the public are they gonna do it they're
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:42.440]  saying that we're basically under martial law now will they implement those war powers will they
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:50.200]  carry that out i'll go over fox cbs a bunch of other places where they are pushing this
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:56.440]  to the public right now we are simulcasting by the way at prisonplanet.tv right now
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:04.360]  let's go ahead and go to one of the founders and the chief engineer over at a cola blue
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:08.200]  hyler palmer for the rest of this segment a little bit of the next then bring him to the economy
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:13.160]  uh with bob chattanoil this uh martial law uh that's being announced that the media is
[1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:17.560]  announcing we got to take this serious we got to say no we're not going to be forcibly inoculated
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:20.760]  no we're not going to your fema camps they're saying even if you're healthy they're going to
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:26.520]  try to shoot you up and then maybe we will have a serious uh uh epidemic on our hands
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:31.400]  because the vaccines have caused so many deaths and so many illnesses and so many pandemics in
[1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:36.200]  the past yes they've had smallpox vaccination programs that have spread it they've had anthrax
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:41.480]  i mean they've had all sorts of problems and remember the 76 swine flu shots are what killed
[1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:46.840]  the people not the swine flu that's on record but i wanted to go to tyler palmer because i wanted to
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:51.240]  get him on because i get emails every day i get calls every day they see the banners up on info
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:59.800]  wars dot com prisonplanet.com to a cola blue a cola blue dot com e c o l o blue blue dot com
[1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:03.240]  and they and i'm not trying to be mean to some of the listeners i know it's the minority of
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:08.520]  listeners that understand this they go how does something suck air i mean you know water out
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:13.720]  of air out of your room and i you know we have one here in the office and when they were i had
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:20.200]  workmen in there putting uh you know some uh uh systems in and some appliances in and they were
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:25.320]  hooking up a water line to it and i said why are you doing this are we just figured this is a water
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:29.320]  dispenser you know it's got a line in the back in case you want it then you can put it through the
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:34.680]  seven filters inside it also has those and i said no this grabs out of the air and they said
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:39.320]  humidity in here it says the humidity in your office is 25 that won't make any water
[1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:42.840]  well it does make about two and a half gallons a day and good humidity it makes seven and a half
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:48.520]  but that's enough for us here in a pretty big office but the point is is that they they couldn't
[1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:54.120]  even believe it the local you know workmen handyman we had in here uh doing this yes the the
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:16:02.280]  there is water in the air and if you condense down the 35 000 feet from sea level to 35 000 feet
[1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:07.160]  on average we're talking 10 feet of water that's what clouds are and this hadn't been to the sewage
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:11.560]  system it hadn't been to the rivers and lakes you know it hasn't been with all the toxins
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:16.280]  then it goes through seven filters so i wanted to have tyler palmer on with us to explain this
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:21.800]  to folks tyler thanks for coming on thank you for having me again alex um it isn't interesting
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:28.120]  that people understand how it rains but they're amazed at a water machine that pulls the water
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:34.920]  out of the air and in fact that's exactly what it's doing is mimicking uh cloud formation and rain
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:40.760]  well those uh moisture evaporators in the south range better be fixed by midday or they'll be
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:46.360]  held to pay uh george lucas certainly understands what they are uh yeah explain it to people
[1:16:46.360 --> 1:16:53.000]  well uh it it takes uh has an intake uh an air intake and the air is uh filtered through
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:17:00.840]  an electrostatic air filter it's then condensed by a uh refrigerant coil uh the air is uh the
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:07.160]  condensate uh that comes out of the air is collected in a uh a lower storage tank that
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:13.800]  tank has a uv uh light in there as well as a an air pump now which we've we've uh added
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:21.400]  it's then pumped through uh three uh silver impregnated carbon filters and one reverse
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:30.440]  osmosis system uh then it's uh sent up to an upper tank that has a uh hot water uh feature
[1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:38.840]  and a uh cold water feature and uh it's blasted with 245 nanometer uv light uh before it comes
[1:17:38.840 --> 1:17:45.160]  out and while it's stored it also has a reflex system and that keeps the water from sitting so
[1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:50.920]  occasionally it goes on and cycles the water through the system the idea being that if you're
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:59.000]  a molecule of h2o in our uh machine uh you're gonna get a shot at all the positions of in the
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.760]  machine in other words you'll be hot water once you'll be cold water etc have you heard the latest
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:08.920]  they are i was joking a month ago when you were on this they are now saying they want to create a
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:15.160]  carbon footprint for water and that water is now bad basically just like carbon dioxide is and if
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:21.000]  you tell the general public the scientific name of water most the public will say bannet right
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:30.360]  right the uh dihydrogen oxide or um it it's true um and you know with this h1n1 uh virus i was
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:36.920]  doing a little research on this yesterday and um one of the common ways of vaccinating flocks of
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:44.600]  birds is to put the vaccine in water um and that would be a really good way to get uh
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:52.040]  the population uh inoculated or or doped up with whatever they want to put in the water
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:58.200]  and they've been caught they've said they want to put prozac and statins this i've got msnbc
[1:18:58.200 --> 1:19:02.760]  clubs and government reports they go it's been proven that statins are good for small children
[1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:07.720]  now you know so called uh uh for those that don't know so called the cholesterol medicine that's
[1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:12.120]  really bad for your liver so we're going to look at putting that in your water and vaccine they've
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:16.520]  said the africans are backwards i've seen this in the news we're going to start engineering
[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:23.800]  pharmacological crops where the yams and corn have live vaccine in it to to make sure they take
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:28.840]  their vaccine stay there tyler i want to talk about that yeah folks we're getting to a point
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:33.560]  where you better filter your water heavily yourself and if you drink what's out of the
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:40.600]  tap you are out of your minds i mean it is especially places like houston with all the
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:47.320]  chemical plants i mean the water in houston tastes like jack daniels folks it's basically yellow

[1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.480]  but i want to get this i'm going to start with the marshal law fair mongering that the media is
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:56.920]  involved in that's what we've been saying day one looks like this is just a regular flu uh
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:03.080]  or even weaker than a regular flu regular flu kills tens of thousands of people a year in the
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:08.920]  us hundreds of thousands worldwide this is killed no more than a couple hundred people max on the
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:16.520]  low end you know nine and they're getting ready to declare global pandemic level six uh forced
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:22.760]  inoculation all this crap even if you're not sick or trying to shoot you up this is horrible folks
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:29.560]  listen to this fox news piece here it is the world health organization raised now the pandemic
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:34.520]  alert for swine flu to the second highest level level five right now mexico has implemented
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:39.320]  quarantines and world leaders issuing travel warnings but of course it could get worse that's
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:46.280]  right if it becomes a pandemic you could lose some simple rights like going to the movies fox
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:51.320]  news legal analyst peter johnson jr joins us live here as well uh peter last night when the president
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:57.720]  united states was talking it sounded like in his uh remarks he was talking about the possibility
[1:27:57.720 --> 1:28:04.360]  that parents should get ready to come up with a contingency plan in case your child's school
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  closes you're exactly right and and that's really been the first national mention of of that issue
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:14.040]  and and i think it's important that we don't scare people and i think an effort's been made here
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:21.880]  not to scare anyone but people and our government have to start thinking about how if this uh actually
[1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:29.080]  becomes a pandemic how it's going to affect our daily life and and and our rights what is a quarantine
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:35.160]  who decides who goes into a quarantine right what is isolation who decides who gets into isolation
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:40.760]  if i want to get out of a quarantine in isolation do i have the ability to go to a court and get out
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:45.560]  will the government say to me you must get a vaccination if one is developed right if i don't
[1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:51.240]  get a vaccination will i be quarantined if i'm a health care provider if i don't show up for work
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:57.480]  at a hospital will i be jailed will i lose my life thought was simple you know it's not it's not
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:29:02.600]  simple um and and we as a society the freest society in the world have to think about the
[1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:08.760]  balancing between saving our lives if this pandemic comes true and the loss of of of liberty and the
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:14.360]  loss of rights um as americans i think as americans in order to stay alive in order to preserve our
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:19.880]  way of life people are willing to give up and to make sacrifices but at the same time there needs
[1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:26.120]  to be an orderly discussion of what the rights are of the american people um when okay okay stop
[1:29:26.120 --> 1:29:29.640]  right there we're we're having that discussion right now we come back there's about a minute left
[1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:34.680]  where they talk about martial law now you heard it forcing you to work work brigades force the
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:39.000]  inoculations but they're not just saying that that's being announced in the news and the government
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:44.040]  documents they are practicing taking over your local communities right now and having local police
[1:29:44.040 --> 1:29:48.920]  force you to do this they've been drilling for years to do it and they're fear mongering over
[1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:56.280]  something that appears to be a complete hoax we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[1:29:56.280 --> 1:30:04.120]  the gcn radio network hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now
[1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:09.000]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:13.640]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:17.400]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:22.200]  happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:28.840]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:33.320]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:39.080]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:44.920]  them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at
[1:30:44.920 --> 1:30:57.080]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter
[1:30:57.080 --> 1:31:03.400]  item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com in the new world order is war against
[1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:09.560]  humanity barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national security
[1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:16.840]  force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded the obama deception completely
[1:31:16.840 --> 1:31:22.200]  destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american people well obama's
[1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:27.880]  already fudging yeah fudge since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical

[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:32.600]  about all right let's go ahead and finish up this fox news piece and notice how devilish it is that's
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:37.320]  like when tommy franks was on pentagon payroll after he retired and it came out he was on the
[1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:43.480]  payroll i predicted it at the time when it wasn't hard that it would come out because he was like
[1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:48.360]  it's sad to say but it's what will keep us safe it's what the american people want but i it's just
[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:53.320]  hard for me as a patriot one more terror attack we're gonna have a military dictatorship for our
[1:33:53.320 --> 1:34:00.680]  own safety and the end of freedom darn it it's what the people want and now they're doing it all
[1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:07.000]  shucks folks got a balance safety and surviving versus their freedom and they're gonna they're
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:11.880]  gonna choose safety versus freedom of course whenever you give up freedom you don't get
[1:34:11.880 --> 1:34:16.440]  safe you get enslaved uh so i'm gonna get bob chappan's take on this and all the big economic
[1:34:16.440 --> 1:34:21.480]  developments in a moment but let's finish little fox news martial law piece here it is um as americans
[1:34:21.480 --> 1:34:25.880]  i think as americans in order to stay alive in order to preserve our way of life people are
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:31.160]  willing to give up and to make sacrifices but at the same time there needs to be an orderly
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:38.680]  discussion of what the rights are of the american people um when this happens sure and and there's
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:42.520]  a lot of modeling that says it doesn't happen at all okay so let's look at some of the examples
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:46.600]  we're talking about closing schools which i'm sure people would understand closing the border to
[1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:53.160]  mexico stop us from gathering in public spaces we mentioned movie theaters i guess freedom to assemble
[1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:58.360]  i can think of a lot of other things like church um other maybe going to the mall well what about
[1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:04.600]  what about legislatures what about the u.s congress what about uh courts of law what about not
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:10.600]  impending juries because we don't want to have public assemblies i spoke to about an hour last
[1:35:10.600 --> 1:35:15.800]  night to dr mark segal who's an expert on on on the flu and he's written a book on in fact he's a
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:20.760]  he was on our show about yeah he's a he's a contributor here at fox news and he pointed out to me
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:28.040]  said listen we can't be panicking at this time um we have examples uh you know when you go back to
[1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:34.840]  the 1918 flu sure and there was a second wave well the problem about the 18 1918 flu was that
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:40.200]  a doctor thought it was a bacteria we didn't know it was a virus sure we have the capacity now
[1:35:40.200 --> 1:35:46.760]  to create uh a potentially a vaccine for the fall that contains this strain of virus that's
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:52.200]  exactly and so that's a big big difference but at the same time we need to be thinking about
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:57.160]  how the legal landscape is going to be changing uh our governors have to be looking at this our
[1:35:57.160 --> 1:36:01.400]  president has to be looking at this our state legislature has to be looking at this and this
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:08.520]  is the time for the eclu to act not to uh uh detain americans as war criminals but to ensure
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:13.560]  that all americans rights are preserved excellent point very interesting points i hadn't thought
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:18.360]  about all that stuff thanks very fortunately plus uh possibility of martial law but that's a whole
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:24.600]  another conversation on the road not going there it's coming out this month and then we have the
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:29.320]  health and human services secretary with all these problems obama's got so many crooks working for him
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.880]  most of them can never get approved his last guy he wanted to get in there uh couldn't dash
[1:36:33.880 --> 1:36:39.640]  old as of all the scams he was in and they don't even have a hearing they just approve her
[1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:44.760]  and so they're getting their whole agenda through meanwhile let's look at the economy
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:49.480]  right now plus bob Chapman has contacts inside mexico city mexico's now saying that the the
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:56.040]  flu cases are subsiding uh so and now they're saying oh only seven or nine or 12 people died
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:59.960]  different numbers from the government but it doesn't matter shut the government down
[1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:04.600]  they have hundreds of deaths a day of the cold and pneumonia in mexico city alone
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:09.160]  bob but i guess just it's the end of the mexican government the end of everything because
[1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:13.240]  a couple people died bob or is this really a way to have everybody stand down
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:19.000]  because they knew they were on the edge of revolution well i don't believe that they
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:26.440]  were on the edge of edge of revolution but um i think like uh we discussed on wednesday uh i think
[1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:32.040]  this is a trial run to see what they can get away with see what the public reactions are
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:39.480]  it's now proven that this is just another old flu and people do die from that unfortunately
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:45.880]  and you've seen the overreaction i know on some of its stations i was on this morning
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:51.720]  throughout the united states um you know the prom has been called off and and we're closing the
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:58.280]  schools for a week and this sort of thing people were told not to go to church on sunday
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:05.160]  because of their contact with one another and of course in mexico uh you you have all of the
[1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:12.440]  children out of school uh the churches are relatively speaking empty and uh along the
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:20.280]  border cities you've got the military going up and down the streets with m60s not m16s m60s
[1:38:20.280 --> 1:38:29.480]  and um uh and and that's happening in several other cities what they're doing in mexico is
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:35.160]  conditioning people to seeing the military around now i know that they've got a problem with drug
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:41.880]  dealers drug purveyors the transporters i guess naco traficante covers the whole thing
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:47.080]  and uh and there's been a war going on between them and the government for the last two years
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:53.480]  and uh and there's also been a war going on between the naco traficantes where they kill
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:59.480]  each other and uh i don't know that's not all that bad because somebody doesn't come and take
[1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:06.040]  the job well the job doesn't get done but anyway it's it's i think it's a trial run uh just like
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:13.640]  you said alex from the very beginning it looked like a hoax uh we were wondering whether uh it was um
[1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:21.080]  um uh genetically specific in other words was appointed towards latin americans
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:29.960]  um i don't think we came to any conclusion on that did we no but the one death in the us was
[1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:37.320]  a 23 month old mexican national baby a boy who'd been premature had lung problems his whole life
[1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:42.920]  and they brought him here for treatment and he died so uh no deaths but meanwhile i have these
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:48.680]  internal state reports where they're fear mongering from three days ago uh and saying we're going to
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:52.360]  level six and all this which they're now announcing that that they're probably going to do but that
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:57.000]  we were already at level six uh but certainly i've been seeing this looks like a hoax from the
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:03.640]  beginning but there is the danger that they could use this for marshal law and and and and bob
[1:40:04.280 --> 1:40:10.680]  christler going under two days ago uh all of this unfolding all of this happening the economic
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:16.440]  numbers coming in a contraction of 6.1 percent it appears the deterioration of the economy's
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:22.440]  accelerating this is another nice distraction from that isn't it it certainly is and if you
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:29.080]  notice as well the working group in financial markets uh had a meeting with uh mr mr geithner
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:33.480]  yesterday who's a treasury secretary and of course their meeting is a secret so you don't know what
[1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:37.640]  they're rigging uh but they've been rigging the stock market and they've been driving the price
[1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:43.400]  of gold and silver down uh during this crisis so that people wouldn't think there was anything
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:53.480]  wrong in that area uh this is a well coordinated effort to test this marshal law concept and we
[1:40:53.480 --> 1:41:00.040]  haven't seen the end of it yet uh i think they've run out of uh most of their ammunition and uh
[1:41:00.040 --> 1:41:04.360]  they'll learn something from it but i don't think they're accomplishing what they wanted to do i think
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:11.800]  there's so many people out there even on fox who would talk about the rights of the the average
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:19.880]  american and i and and that is important and uh well bob i hardly agree with you good exactly i
[1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:24.360]  agree with you and that's what we were saying saturday on the emergency transmission on debon
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:31.080]  they were really starting to hype this is that if this isn't a serious flu and and if this is
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:36.600]  hype which we said it probably was then we hoped uh and and we still hope and we're not out of the
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:41.400]  woods completely yet we'll know in the next few days we start seeing a bunch of deaths in the us
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:46.040]  then this could be serious but i mean usually a flu kills thousands anyways that'll be normal
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:50.200]  can you imagine if they're shutting the whole country down in police state for one death what
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:55.640]  50 deaths would do which is completely normal but but but side issue there you know again it's not
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:01.400]  that this is even real it's that they're making it real but napolitano that homeland security janet
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:05.640]  comes out uh the one putting out reports saying the veterans are terrorists and gun owners are
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:11.000]  terrorists and she says well this may peter out in a few weeks but another big one is coming
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:17.160]  very soon there will be a pandemic so i agree with you as the economy falls apart i think we're i
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:23.240]  i know we're seeing a beta test of what they're going to do to try to sell their overall agenda
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:27.800]  and keep themselves in power oh you're trying to arrest the bankers you're trying to take congress
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:35.240]  back then they'll release a real bio weapon and then that'll be their cover for martial law
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:42.200]  i think you're right and at the same time uh they'll probably crack up the crank up uh
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:48.840]  at the end the invasion of pakistan and and they may allow israel to uh attack aran as well
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:53.800]  they'll have it all going up in the air at the same time and then that way people just kind of
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:59.160]  go into a catatonic state they've done psychological tests uh with dogs guinea pigs rats and humans
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:04.920]  now where they put you in a cage and shock you and uh you know there's a one of the cases is where
[1:43:04.920 --> 1:43:08.920]  they have rats in a rat maze and they just keep shocking them and shocking them till the rat
[1:43:08.920 --> 1:43:14.360]  finally just gives up and stays in one spot and dies the one spot where he's not being shocked
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:17.720]  and they've done the test with where they'll have a puppy in a cage the marines have done this test
[1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:23.320]  and published it and they it's learned helplessness uh as a caller pointed out one time i'd seen the
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:27.080]  study but they reminded me of this and every time the dog comes over to eat he gets shocked
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:31.640]  and there's one little spot in the cage where he doesn't get shocked and after trying 10 or 15
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:36.680]  times he'll go over and get in the corner and die and lay down and take it and i agree when they
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:40.680]  finally make their total move which we see all this preparation for and the world government
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:45.400]  being announced in the police state and troops at checkpoints and announcing martial law may come
[1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:49.960]  for your safety when they finally make the jump it's going to be everything at once what are we
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:56.120]  going to see do you think bob i don't know i don't know what the reaction of the public's
[1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:02.120]  going to be and i you know the longer they wait the better it is and the reason i say that is that
[1:44:02.120 --> 1:44:08.520]  the the worst the financial and economic situation is going to be if they were to have to or would
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:15.480]  hold off for another year and a half or so but two years to do that that would be very good because
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:20.920]  there should be 35 percent unemployment by then and it's going to be an awful lot of very unhappy
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:29.480]  people under bridges and so our strength our chance to take the government back it's better
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:33.000]  and better the longer they wait i hate to be giving them this advice but i know they're
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:39.160]  smart they've already figured this out bob yeah they should have and they've made a lot of mistakes
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:45.880]  and and you know things pop up every day like these scandals were made off and now it's all
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:53.160]  over cnbc this morning that geithner's not making the decisions rama manual is and of course
[1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:59.560]  he works for israel as well as a president and you know the people are getting sick of this
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:08.280]  and then if you take away their freedom and you take away their ability to work and make a living
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:13.560]  and not have to live under some mysterious circumstances you get the seeds of revolution
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:17.240]  and i'll tell you something i don't think we're going to be able to hold the people back they're
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:22.520]  not going to get away with this have you seen the new speaking of the administration the new
[1:45:22.520 --> 1:45:27.640]  people magazine came out with obama's beauties and they talk about how sexy and beautiful
[1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:34.040]  uh... rama manual is how sexy and beautiful geithner is i mean soon will these guys be like
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:40.520]  sitting on thrones and royal robes with crowns i mean and and and and openly ruling us i mean
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:45.800]  how ridiculous is it that all these criminal oligarchs running our nations are just publicly
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:50.280]  robbing everyone right now i mean how how much more degrading does it have to get
[1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:56.840]  it i think it has to get a lot more and and the psychology because the the american people
[1:45:57.560 --> 1:46:02.280]  don't want to really pull the trigger on their own government uh... they're thinking that they
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:06.920]  might have to but it's very very distasteful i mean even for somebody like me who's been
[1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:14.040]  in the trenches for almost fifty years but uh... economics an empty belly this is what's
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:19.240]  going to motivate people uh... people being told well your children have to go over the
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:23.240]  that school over there in chicago and uh... you're going to be in the camp uh...
[1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:27.480]  in arizona and you are going to be working in new york city
[1:46:27.480 --> 1:46:30.040]  uh... i think finally they'll wake up
[1:46:32.200 --> 1:46:35.720]  and that's what they're announcing on the news all we're going to tell you where you work and
[1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:41.000]  what you do we're going to forcibly inject you it's the new freedom for your safety one person
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  died so america has to end you know we were covering this in nineteen sixty six sixty seven and sixty
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:54.120]  eight all the plans were laid out then it was called regional government
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:58.760]  and they now admit it is the regional governments that are in control
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:02.040]  and under the united nations control the congress's ceremonial
[1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:08.120]  i mean it's in reuters and a p that the u n is directing the u s mexican and other nations
[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:14.200]  responses and the s p p documents for the north american union came out and and they say they're
[1:47:14.200 --> 1:47:20.040]  going to use flu crises to bring in the n a u they wrote that three years ago bob
[1:47:21.160 --> 1:47:26.600]  that's right here we go uh... uh... we got a war on a multiplicity of fronts
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:32.360]  they're all over the place i mean you know you look at my publication twice a week the links
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:38.920]  look at your site uh... the things that you've got on there it just does this one problem after
[1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:46.280]  another uh... and you know we cover them closely and we can't really even adequately cover them
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:53.400]  during the course of a week hey why do you think we've got massive sustained multiple
[1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:57.160]  denial of service attacks over our c d n's at our servers
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:02.840]  and uh... then when we would uh... switch out so they couldn't hit the servers they would just hit
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:09.240]  the entire facilities uh... clearly governmental uh... i mean don't they doesn't the government know
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:14.120]  that just makes everybody want to visit info wars dot com and present planet dot com that much more
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:20.280]  and that that you'll basically underlines and certifies what we're doing it's an occupational
[1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:25.800]  hazard for them and they think in their arrogance that they're more powerful and on much smarter
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:32.760]  than we are and uh... the sheeple out there uh... we'll listen to them and not us uh... the factor
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:40.360]  here the swing factor is the economy which they have deliberately denigrated worldwide
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:44.280]  in order to bring about world government but at the same time when they do that
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:48.520]  they bring people down to this uh... savage level if you may
[1:48:49.080 --> 1:48:54.200]  and they they they know that they're creating a problem well they could creating a condition
[1:48:54.200 --> 1:49:00.600]  that they want it's just like interest rates uh... the treasury needs them higher to track more money
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:06.040]  and the fed wants them down to what people buy houses you can't have it both ways and so
[1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:12.840]  the treasury of the fed are in a ringer and so aren't the alumnus behind the throne
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:18.840]  they're in the same ringer and they know they're not going to have an easy time doing this
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:21.880]  well that's what we've been saying and i said two months ago and then i got a month ago
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:27.960]  so i see them playing the controlled bio weapon release whether it's fair mongering or the real
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:33.000]  thing because that's the only thing they don't have to blame it on men in a cave and the proof
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:37.800]  comes out it wasn't in a cave they can just say it naturally popped up oh my god we've got to take
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:42.840]  your rights to keep you safe from this and then that becomes the news cycle instead of losing your
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:47.880]  job and then it makes the government the savior who's going to hand out the tamaflu and the vaccines
[1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:54.680]  to you and you know direct other response and i i really think we're seeing what their response
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:59.640]  is going to be and that is napolitano said this is basically just the beginning i think we're
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:03.480]  witnessing how they're going to come at us bob and if we get the word out about how they're
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:08.760]  coming at us that's going to give us a leg up on them that's right and it might stop them from
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:14.840]  doing it so we got a really pound on this and let people know and all you listen is out there have
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:21.000]  got all have to let all the people that you know that this is a scam and this is what they're up to

[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:53.080]  back to the economy uh you've got a lot of data on that uh you notice how chrysler goes under two
[1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:58.280]  days ago and then the stock market shoots up as the plunge protection team dumps money in
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:05.880]  what do you see happening in the short term and the long term well i think the uh short term uh
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:11.400]  the dow jones has run its course and uh i think that's as far as i'm going to take it uh we're
[1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:17.160]  looking at a reverse head and shoulders on gold and silver uh which has been being completed right
[1:57:17.160 --> 1:57:23.800]  now uh that should they should shoot back up again quite quite soon uh we're looking at um
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:31.880]  the the economy is not going to revive uh for the next year and a half we'll probably go
[1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:36.840]  sideways to slightly lower in other words the gdp which in the fourth fourth quarter was
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:43.320]  a minus 6.3 percent minus 6.1 percent in the first quarter will probably be minus five in the
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:48.760]  second quarter and maybe minus four during the last half of the year uh next year it might go to
[1:57:48.760 --> 1:57:55.400]  even and that's it and that's the extent of any revival that they could have in the economy right
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:58:02.360]  now it's still on its back and there's been no improvement and so when they do these things
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:08.440]  which should have never been started in the first place that is bailing out wall street the financial
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:17.480]  companies g e a i g uh and um and then now uh general modus and particularly chrysler which
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:25.640]  has been put into bankruptcy they know because of their own plans that chrysler and g and gm
[1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:32.200]  are not going to make it they've already made that decision that's right they have back at 70

[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:25.080]  people out there who have the same abilities that we have and they've got to get in this fight
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:31.960]  they've got to get in and get publications and and get pamphlets out to people and get on the
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:37.960]  internet and try to get a program i mean i sent somebody who i thought was worthy to

[2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:25.240]  mind understand the enemy their psychology how they operate what they do with what is more and more
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:28.600]  becoming clear i said this back on saturday when first an emergency transmission that i
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:32.680]  believe it was a hoax and now it's becoming more and more abundantly clear but meanwhile
[2:08:32.680 --> 2:08:37.320]  the fear monger just intensifies now think about it you can get 30 plus thousand people on average
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:43.160]  dying of flu sometimes more sometimes less in the united states between 200 and half a million
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:49.160]  every year dying worldwide of the regular flu and they're telling you get ready for the end of all
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:55.480]  your freedom forced inoculations total control for one dead person in the united states let's go
[2:08:55.480 --> 2:09:00.920]  ahead and play this local news clip off local news here in austin where they're getting tense cities
[2:09:00.920 --> 2:09:07.560]  ready with michael dell the new world order menu and here it is why do you think somebody should
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:12.680]  sign up to run the congress avenue we're having some trouble streaming that off the web we
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:19.160]  okay yeah the problem is is that it it refresh we're playing these ads off the web we all
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:23.640]  now start having a hard drive or recapture these and then we can just play in because these stupid
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:28.760]  news sites it's not a youtube or google they just have the worst players and it'll be working and
[2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:34.280]  you try to play and it doesn't work well we'll play in a minute coming up with alan watt and be
[2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:40.440]  sure and send that to the guys to link to that up on info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com but
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:45.800]  let's go ahead and bring alan watt up alan i haven't talked to you before the show i have no
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:50.360]  idea what your view is of this but i would imagine it's probably similar to mine give us your breakdown
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:55.560]  of what's happening with the fear mongering right now with the pretty much imaginary flow
[2:09:56.760 --> 2:10:03.400]  well it's one crisis after another we're just coming through the the created financial collapse
[2:10:03.400 --> 2:10:09.640]  that rose the imf to its proper position as the distributor for the world's money and it was time
[2:10:09.640 --> 2:10:13.960]  to teach the public that the world health organization will be the world authority
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:21.000]  that will guide every country and actually be the ruler as far as medical things go for the entire
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:26.680]  planet but ultimately you must remember the world health organization's agenda is to do with sustainable
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:31.080]  development once they have that authority they're going to move right into the next part which is
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:38.680]  depopulation sterilization etc for sustainability reasons and there's no mystery about this because
[2:10:38.680 --> 2:10:43.640]  when the league of nations was set up with the same organizations that are in the united nations
[2:10:43.640 --> 2:10:49.640]  including a world health authority some of the founders at the time wrote about it and they said
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:55.080]  this is being set up to be the world health authority and they must use panic and crisis
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:59.720]  to get the public to give them that authority that's exactly what we're going through today
[2:10:59.720 --> 2:11:07.160]  this flu is just the standard h1n1 it was out last year according to the bbc and to the so-called
[2:11:07.160 --> 2:11:13.880]  experts in britain uh tamo flu was it's pretty useless anyway uh all the hype about tamo flu
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:19.320]  came from the pharma companies that made the dark drugs all their studies are from their paid agents
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:24.680]  to give them glowing reports but basically you don't need it because this is a mild flu and those
[2:11:24.680 --> 2:11:30.200]  who are dying of it and it's really is down to seven proven cases in mexico not a hundred and seven
[2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:37.960]  um you find they're compromised already with different other diseases aids etc etc so this is
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:42.920]  a very very mild flu it takes but three days everyone who's got it in canada and britain
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:47.880]  are told is to stay at home drink lots of food all the usual stuff and it's gone in about three
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:53.800]  days that's it so clearly out of the blue they have been fair mongering and saying i mean i've got
[2:11:53.800 --> 2:11:59.560]  the headlines this is the greatest challenge to face humanity you know this could be the end
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:05.160]  hundreds of millions could die and then meanwhile it yeah mexico's saying between seven and twelve
[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:11.240]  dead one dead in the united states that person from mexico city uh but meanwhile i've got
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:19.320]  time newsweek cbs cnn uh all of these publications tv saying get ready for forced
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:25.480]  inoculations even if you haven't had the flu and now they're saying oh even if this passes over in
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:30.920]  the next month when the flu shots ready we're gonna make you take it so i think this is also
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:36.840]  about pushback yep to all the tens of millions of people waking up to how deadly vaccines are
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:40.920]  who are saying no i'm not going to take it and they're trying to test the public to see if they
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:45.560]  can force us to do it so when they launch the real attack during the full collapse of society
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:49.240]  you watch when the when the resistance to the new order starts when we're trying to take our
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:55.720]  government's back they are going to launch massive real bio attacks uh allen your comments on that
[2:12:55.720 --> 2:13:02.200]  yeah this is um you see that there have been so many studies coming out over the years of the fact
[2:13:02.200 --> 2:13:07.480]  that the flu inoculations every year the tell you in the spring they had the wrong combinations of
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:12.600]  flu strain so they were useless but not only that most people who get the flu injections
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:16.920]  end up coming down with the flu so people are stopping getting that they're taking their free
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:23.080]  flu shots so they have to do something to get it back up to a mandatory level and they admit and
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:27.560]  they admit i keep forgetting to make this point in a rep you make me think allen they admit that
[2:13:27.560 --> 2:13:33.560]  all these flu shots actually mutate with regular flu out there and are creating more dangerous
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:40.200]  strains and the tamiflu accelerates the mutation just like antibiotics do with the bacteria yes
[2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:44.920]  that they're using human beings as predators and that's what they use the animals for that's how
[2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:51.160]  they breed the virus desire and chickens or some other kind of animal or human fetal tissue and
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:57.080]  now they're using living people and everyone who gets the shot becomes a breeder and they shed the
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:03.240]  virus wherever they go yeah it's it's just absolutely amazing allen why do you think
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:08.520]  napolitano came out and said oh well this one's probably no big deal but the next one it's coming
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:13.720]  it's going to be huge i know and then and then flying air force one through the middle of buildings
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:19.640]  with f-16s literally 50 feet away and then it came out in memos they terrorized them on purpose
[2:14:19.640 --> 2:14:26.120]  but said it's secret what is behind that we'll never get the whole story in fact we never get
[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:32.360]  that could be real truth about anything to be honest with you um as i see we're living at an age
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:38.360]  where we have so many distractions and crisis and we're rolling now from simply one crisis to another
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:45.720]  but what is interesting is that out of every crisis the the institutions at the world the
[2:14:45.720 --> 2:14:51.160]  united nations are risen up that's always the solution to their global authority positions
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:56.920]  with with imf the world bank etc now we're seeing the same thing with the health now
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:02.280]  they're on a roll for complete domination of the planet because the united nations was set up remember
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:08.840]  as a front by the big foundations and the rockefellows etc to be of the world authority
[2:15:09.400 --> 2:15:14.120]  so this is the the sense of change for globalism where they bring this whole structure in
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:19.720]  and they can only do it through crisis creation and offer the solutions which of course was the plan
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:24.680]  all along we're going to roll and roll from solution to solution in crisis to crisis people
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:33.080]  have already forgotten that trillions of dollars have been looted from them just a few months ago
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:36.760]  and alan how obvious is it and we're gonna play this clip and i want to get your answer to this
[2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:41.240]  as you just said i'm watching john carrey last night in the center hearing he says we've got to
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:45.800]  have a global solution this global crisis and the head of the u.n the secretary general mr
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:52.520]  moon is admitting they're directing the united states and canada and in australia and and all
[2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:57.160]  the commonwealth countries are the ones hyping this up the worst they're admitting that they're
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:01.480]  using this they say to strengthen the global governance let's play this clip of the fair
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:08.840]  monitoring in austin with the camps with the tents being set up for the mass death here it is and on
[2:16:08.840 --> 2:16:13.000]  that note a modified tent city now being set up at delt children's hospital for those who believe
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:17.320]  that they have the flu fox and drudy koski joining us live from delt children's hospital with the
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:22.440]  details rudy hi loryana the tent started going up this afternoon they're located directly behind
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:27.960]  me now take a look they're in a physician parking area that is directly underneath the
[2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:33.800]  helicopter pad now the tents are expected to be ready for people by tomorrow they're still
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:38.600]  hooking up climate control systems and they're doing this because of a large number of people
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:45.240]  showing up to get a flu test by mid-afternoon for example the hospital had more than 400 people
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:51.320]  coming into the emergency room they usually have about 170 administrators say the tents there's
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:56.840]  about three of them will help separate those who just may be really sick from those who are seeking
[2:16:56.840 --> 2:17:01.800]  other types of medical treatment at the emergency room once again taking a look at a live picture
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:07.640]  of the situation here at delt the tents are near right underneath the helipad and the physician
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:12.920]  parking area administrators here and at other local hospitals are also asking people who want
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:18.120]  to get tested to stop going to local emergency rooms the first thing that they say that you
[2:17:18.120 --> 2:17:23.480]  should be doing is contacting your primary care physician after that or if that doesn't work
[2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:29.160]  then you can go to a local neighborhood medical clinic one of those doc in the boxes that will
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:34.840]  relieve the pressure on especially trauma events at the emergency rooms so once again if you're
[2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:39.480]  feeling ill or you just want to test go check with your primary care doctor first or go to one of
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.600]  your neighborhood local medical clinics well of course have more on this story tonight at nine
[2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:49.640]  reporting live at delt's children's hospital rudikowski fox now by the way i've told everybody for
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:57.720]  11 years that the old robert mehler airport is a fema camp and we have local newscast saying
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:02.920]  during emergencies they have 747 hangers with bolts and chains in the floors porta potties
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:09.000]  uh cots barbed wire inside and i i reported it a year before it was in the news people laughed
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:12.680]  at me because i had inside sources that put it in you know the cops are calling me on man you
[2:18:12.680 --> 2:18:17.320]  got to see this place it's a fema camp then i've got local fox again going oh yes it's an emergency
[2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:22.840]  camp for you that's in police state to the takeover this is right next door to that there's troops
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:28.360]  running around all over the old airport uh down the street at the old mall uh they've taken over
[2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:33.240]  two of the major areas and have fema in there going back a few months ago and then you walk up and
[2:18:33.240 --> 2:18:37.400]  say why is homeland security here they say get back get back get back and this is happening
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:43.480]  everywhere alan watt uh you know i mean how how much more obvious is this have to get this is all
[2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:51.400]  a beta test for when they release the real control plague it is too and um fema made it quite clear
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:57.880]  in your lanes that's no other contingency plans would be allowed except they're on in fact you
[2:18:57.880 --> 2:19:04.680]  couldn't even help your neighbor you're not authorized uh and rescue etc etc so you're
[2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:11.160]  looking at all power to even save ourselves been taken up by the official authorized organization
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:16.280]  and this is also treating the public that that is so this is so this is the way it will be
[2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:24.200]  and so if they say they will eventually one day release something because the true cutting edge
[2:19:24.200 --> 2:19:31.160]  on virology and bacteriology is not in the ordinary medical profession it's in back to you on warfare

[2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:38.840]  into black ski mask thugs back when we could still own firearms for the Beatles and back when we
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:46.200]  could still have children without getting a license when a man could still work still work
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:53.320]  for himself and not at a work camp with a potbellied commie bossing him around the best of the free
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:25:03.320]  life behind us now and are the good times really over we're good we're rolling down here like a
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:11.320]  snowball headed for hail all right merma's is popping in ellen wants our guest appreciate him
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:15.160]  coming on this was great insight i don't want to hear what he has to say about this in detail
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:19.400]  and how we should counter it this is a desperation move by the establishment is a debate assessment
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:25.720]  yeah all over the world if anybody has any type of symptom the tattletale citizens freak out on
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:30.680]  them they have them jerked off planes panicking this is the secret police drilling and i always
[2:25:30.680 --> 2:25:35.400]  said they would do it in the name of medical that's how hitler started grabbing people for
[2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:39.640]  plagues or medical problems or flows and then they were mentally retarded and then they were
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:44.040]  had medical problems and long before the camps and the soviets did this to bermus
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:47.400]  given the new article that will get ellen wants take on it yeah i was just uh... running into the
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:52.200]  coffee uh... room and i see all the sudden on fox news this woman is being dragged off a united
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:58.440]  plane after it's diverted from munich germany into boston and then you see her being taken off
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:03.480]  by two people in big yellow what looks like hazmat uniform it's all part of it
[2:26:03.480 --> 2:26:08.040]  it's all acting it's all part of theater setting up emergency tents people in biosuits
[2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:11.640]  and they're on the news when we were going to make you take shots you know uh... ellen want
[2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:16.440]  they could mind control us maybe we just this little event maybe there'd be no deaths and
[2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:20.840]  they would just end all freedom and have everyone has met suits i mean do you think they're going
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:26.200]  for the gold right now or is this just a beta test it's a beta test right there they could
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:30.760]  be no deaths at all and still vote for it because i said years ago when they first brought out the
[2:26:30.760 --> 2:26:35.480]  movie outbreak that was the first movie the condition of the public oh my god this could be
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:41.000]  terrible for a real outbreak it was done through fiction and i said they all they need to show you
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:45.560]  this guy's and hazmat suits and a stretcher and someone on it that they could do in a studio
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:50.040]  and that's broadcast to the world and they all believe it that's all they have to do today it's
[2:26:50.040 --> 2:26:55.240]  like like the dog seeing it's believing and that becomes your perception of reality so
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:26:59.960]  so it's so simple be quite right this is a big push to the public of the world conditions
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:06.120]  and how ridiculous in hazmat suits and it's killed one person i know and the one person really
[2:27:06.120 --> 2:27:10.280]  uh... we don't know the details of how they were compromised by other diseases or illnesses there
[2:27:10.280 --> 2:27:14.680]  will be something more to that oh no it came out the houston chronicle he was premature
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:18.680]  like three pounds when he was born he always had lung problems and a bunch of other diseases
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:25.080]  yeah that's it so basically uh... this is a mild flu but they'll use it to the maximum extreme
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:30.600]  because you're quite right they want to train the public that were so helpless in this brave new
[2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:35.960]  world that uh... we can't feed ourselves anymore with the money's gone to the dogs we can't handle
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:40.280]  anything and now we have all these natures turned against us remember what they said too
[2:27:40.840 --> 2:27:46.040]  at the club of Rome we must teach the public that man is the enemy of the planet and nature
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:51.640]  is at war with men and so they're using all of this right now because feel utterly helpless
[2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:56.440]  but with the big global authorities don't worry the experts will have in hand and we must obey
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:28:02.280]  the experts and believe you me for the billions in help of experts who will pay dearly for all
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:07.080]  their help but no right to talk about this the more the bankers help us the more you know they
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:11.400]  get us a federal reserve to end uh... financial problems they gave us a depression and they gave
[2:28:11.400 --> 2:28:15.400]  us a national security act now they're giving us another depression and they openly are giving
[2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:20.200]  us the depression and they're getting more power out of it instead of just arresting these people
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:24.040]  exactly and not only that uh... before
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:29.720]  the britain road britain woods was a part one and the founder john meaner keen said part two will
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:34.600]  kick in in the next century and here it comes and now they're going to be the issuers of world
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:40.200]  currency that was the solution we're simply living a script and as we live the script the public
[2:28:40.200 --> 2:28:47.480]  has to be trained just trained like animals and skinnerian techniques to obey obey obey all authority
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:52.520]  that's the key to it we must obey authority and they're giving people these mindless phobias i mean
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:56.680]  literally i've been watching tv shows the clips have been sent to me alan talk about predictive
[2:28:56.680 --> 2:29:01.320]  programming scores of shows bermas stay here i want you to tell my story when we come back

[2:33:12.440 --> 2:33:17.960]  Ellen Watt Charlie Sheen says he's a great guy Max Kozer's friends with him uh and but he is a
[2:33:17.960 --> 2:33:22.680]  gun grabber I don't like that and he's going to be uh uh running for Cindy talking about now but
[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:25.800]  you're not talking about Ellen Watt you're talking about Alec Baldwin he's Allen Alec Baldwin
[2:33:25.800 --> 2:33:30.680]  he said he said he said Allen Allen Allen Allen Allen Watt is running for Senate and he's friends
[2:33:30.680 --> 2:33:34.440]  with Charlie Sheen now listen I got too much going on in my head Burmese and I'm also listening
[2:33:34.440 --> 2:33:40.680]  he breathed in the microphone but the issue is Burmese will be uh live tonight uh nine to midnight
[2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:44.920]  with the info warrior show here on the network doing a great job and I'll be popping in with him
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:48.920]  some as well because I'm gonna be up there working on a film a special release we're gonna be
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:55.400]  announcing next week something a little special but um going back to Alec Baldwin is a great actor
[2:33:55.400 --> 2:34:03.160]  and I want to get Allen Watt's take on this with predictive programming and so I wanted to play
[2:34:03.160 --> 2:34:08.600]  this particular clip from Hulu and if you watch the clip carefully he's playing the part of an
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:13.640]  alien you know a master race when he walks in it shows people behind him being let away dead
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:17.560]  to have their brains taken after your brains are taken they're they're gonna kill you and they say
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:23.080]  you know it's ridiculous that uh TV on you know eats your brain it only softens it Hulu takes it
[2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:27.800]  all the way what are you gonna do turn your TV off well TV really is doing this the elites see
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:35.080]  themselves as the more lock us the Eloy they are controlling us they are doing all of this
[2:34:36.120 --> 2:34:43.400]  and so this is how they are conditioning us so this is really a very sinister ad as they throw
[2:34:43.400 --> 2:34:48.120]  it in our face and it's funny that we're being killed and we're being brainwashed we're losing
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:53.400]  our soul to the television when in reality it it's actually doing that causing Alzheimer's
[2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:57.000]  all these other things all the big studies but how it does cause brain damage they make a big
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.800]  joke out of it in his TV show you were saying one of many we've heard about but you saw it
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:06.600]  where everybody's fighting to get the vaccine uh so this is how they do predictive programming
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:10.680]  I want Allen Watt to talk about that but here is the Super Bowl Hulu ad right now
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:18.920]  hello earth I'm Alec Baldwin TV star you know they say TV will rot your brain
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:28.280]  that's absurd TV only softens the brain like a ripe banana to take it all the way we've created
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:34.680]  Hulu Hulu beams TV directly to your portable computing devices giving you more of the cerebral
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:47.160]  gelatinizing shows you want any time anywhere for free mushy and mushy and the best part is
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:50.600]  there's nothing you could do to stop it I mean what are you gonna do turn off your TV and your
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:58.920]  computer once your brain's reduced to a cottage cheese like mush we'll scoop them out with a
[2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:06.120]  melon baller and gobble them right on up oops I think I'm drooling a little because we're aliens
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:13.400]  and that's how we roll Hulu an evil plot to destroy the world enjoy now but see there's the big joke
[2:36:13.400 --> 2:36:18.200]  there is that oh we're enslaving you and the guy's laughing and he's laughing back at him then he
[2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:23.240]  stops laughing it's a fake laugh it's like look this ad is a joke on you don't even know if Baldwin
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:27.960]  understands this he's dinner too you know I mean in between the laughing gives him that look like
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:33.560]  I'm gonna eat you you know it's crazy crazy and it shows him in the background taking people they've
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:40.360]  killed away and it's all done like in a clinical way now now uh allen watt tell folks about predictive
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:43.960]  programming for those that don't understand the government admits in the media admits like you
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:49.800]  watch all science fiction movie starship troopers uh you know that science fiction movie that they
[2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:54.840]  just did with uh fears go with cloney it's all about I want to really do good so I get a license
[2:36:54.840 --> 2:36:59.960]  to have children so I can compete to be one out of a thousand to have kids uh that's predictive
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:03.880]  programming they're telling you what the future is going to be and you see stuff 40 years ago in
[2:37:03.880 --> 2:37:08.520]  science fiction it's what happened today explain predictive programming and then and then Burmese
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:14.200]  is going to briefly tell folks what happened on this last sitcom with alec Baldwin it's a scientific
[2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:22.920]  process of familiarization to the public you come up familiarize them with ideas in a fictional
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:28.840]  format when it's in fiction this sensor part of your brain is down you're being entertained you think
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:35.480]  but it's implanting a possible idea a possibility of something to come different and it starts to
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:41.240]  happen gradually in society this actual idea comes into uh it becomes concrete and it's
[2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:45.800]  implemented you think it's all quite natural there we're somehow progressing naturally along
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:51.160]  a certain path but in in reality your mind has already been prepared to accept something you
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:56.920]  would never never otherwise accept because you'd be reasoning through it through fiction you're
[2:37:56.920 --> 2:38:04.120]  reading through and when it's coupled with emotion to every movie every novel has a character you
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:10.040]  will identify with the hero the heroine and you identify with them and you go through things
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:15.560]  that that you may go through when you realize with them when you couple with the actual
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:21.160]  uh downloads the actual downloads implanted of the idea of something to come you're now
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:26.280]  familiar with it and so emotion is the best way to do it because they're more to programming
[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:32.920]  and in that sense they can put anything into your mind especially series scenarios and they
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:38.520]  will have they will have a set of art types they admit this in broadcast school of the guy that's
[2:38:38.520 --> 2:38:43.560]  the cool kid next door and the info babe and the guy that's the father figure and the mother figure
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:47.880]  or like in the transformers the new one coming out you've got the hero optimist prime jumping
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:52.600]  up on the giant robot you know like one of our ancestors jumping on the back of the mastodon
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:58.840]  you know it's all these preconditioned ancient instincts you know almost ancestral memories
[2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:03.240]  and the establishment admits this that they are programming and so i've been watching online the
[2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:09.640]  old 1980s gi joe gold is bad cobra believes in that as a currency wearing black ski masks is good
[2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:15.400]  the police states good checkpoints are good watch children's shows and it's total and now they admit
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:20.280]  gi joe's basically funded by the pentagon as product placement and now it's just out in the
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:24.760]  open they're programming everything and then they admit the pentagon develop video games now
[2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:29.240]  they're hiring people that are good at the flight simulators to fly the predator drones now the zit
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:34.360]  face kids are 25 they're actually flying the death drones they're being recruited into the air force
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:39.640]  now they're saying soon within five six years we're gonna have to have you jacked in with a chip
[2:39:39.640 --> 2:39:43.880]  into your brain you know you don't have to take the chip you're just a hero you know you're a
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:50.360]  fighter pilot in your pod 10 000 miles away i mean it's all happening it's all really unfolding
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:57.400]  it's a script wherever the script was written a long time ago and the big foundations that
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:04.200]  probably employ more psychologists and experts on anthropology ethnology etc than any other
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:10.360]  agencies or governments in the world and they basically are the ones the power of government
[2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:14.200]  is comprised a member of big foundations which are just the fronts for the bankers
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:21.480]  and they bypass all democracy they have their agenda their agenda was written a long time ago
[2:40:21.480 --> 2:40:26.840]  the big boys who gave us brave new world in the 1930s talking about genetic engineering
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:32.840]  of a fixed population with special purposes for you be designated with your job for life
[2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:38.520]  you'd be proud to be created for that job physically created for that job um it's not
[2:40:38.520 --> 2:40:45.480]  in the 30s they all belong to the same organization for this world governmental system a scientific
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:51.400]  dictatorship with what hoxley called it and that's what we're going into and they're using fear
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:57.080]  now the we've all heard about the global warming scams and so on and so on and again it's coming
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:41:03.560]  from the united nations the international panel on climate change here's a quote from them here's a
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:08.760]  quote from like one of the top guys there at the united nations steven schneider stanford professor
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:14.680]  of climatology lead author of the ipcc reports for the united nations he says we need to get some
[2:41:14.680 --> 2:41:20.440]  broad-based support the public support to capture the public's imagination so we have to offer up
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:26.520]  theory scenarios made simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:31.480]  doubts in other words terror terror terror it is each of us has to decide what's the right balance
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:38.040]  between being effective and being honest and then the other chairman sir hugh houghton of the ipcc
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:43.880]  united nations is giving the global warming scam it is unless we announce disasters no one will listen
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:48.440]  well this whole health thing right with the flu right now is for the world health organization
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:54.200]  at united nations and it's now their turn to do the same thing with theory scenarios that's what's
[2:41:54.200 --> 2:42:00.440]  happening right now absolutely now now here's just a microcosm of predictive programming and it came
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:07.000]  out the fbi and the pentagon this is even on uh television i already read about it years ago when
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:12.280]  i was watching tv i think it was history channel did a show about the history of swat teams and
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:17.640]  said that they wanted to introduce it to the public they just said it calmly so they introduced
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:23.080]  to the public through the tv show swat and that became the model and then all departments wanted
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:28.120]  to be special paramilitary forces and that the pentagon and and and fbi were running it and
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:33.080]  funding it and so that conditioned them with an us against them you know no longer the guardian no
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:37.880]  longer the peacekeeper no longer of the people now a separate group and then you saw that and all
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:42.520]  the children's programming but tell them just about the show with alec baldman not ellen one
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:48.040]  with uh with a alec bald one where they're all fighting to get the flu shot and we checked this
[2:42:48.040 --> 2:42:55.160]  was this was shot months ago airing last week perfectly to coincide with all of this i mean
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:43:01.160]  again lady and then i'm getting all these youtube clips of other shows simultaneously uh doing this
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:05.640]  just like the movie pearl harbour comes out right as nine eleven hits where and they say oh it's just
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:10.200]  like pearl harbour and of course the actors don't even know this but this is the psychiatrist
[2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:13.960]  the psychologist doing this tell them about it yeah if people don't know 30 rock is basically a
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:19.080]  spoof of sirenet live behind the scenes and what happens is people start getting the flu in the
[2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:24.040]  office so everybody starts freaking out and of course the ceo's the big rich guys are the only
[2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:29.160]  ones that can get the vaccination so everybody's trying to weasel around and get the vaccines
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:33.720]  from the ceo's and be the chosen few that won't get sick from the flu and then of course by the
[2:43:33.720 --> 2:43:38.920]  end of the show the ceo's are okay they took the shots and everybody else is sick with the flu
[2:43:38.920 --> 2:43:43.480]  giving out that message you have to take the shot if you want to be okay and if there's
[2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:48.920]  anything i learned from gi joe jones when i was a kid is that knowing is half the battle and that's
[2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:53.080]  what we're trying to do we're trying to tell people the truth so they know what's going on
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:59.640]  absolutely and the other half's being willing to take the enemy on but uh i mean i mean alan
[2:43:59.640 --> 2:44:04.840]  how'd i guess this works for the american idol crowd but don't people know they're being programmed
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:10.440]  constantly don't the actors like alec Baldwin know that they're programming people to want to go out
[2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:15.400]  and take shots or do these people just say hey i'm going to join the dark side you know uh i like
[2:44:15.400 --> 2:44:21.160]  being part of the elite it's fun to get it over on the people well he knows he knows i know because
[2:44:21.160 --> 2:44:27.160]  he i've seen him on geoleno on other shows and he comes out with his little uh there was corona
[2:44:27.160 --> 2:44:32.040]  signed with his his forefinger and so on and right in the camera in fact so so much so the
[2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:36.200]  better we've not to push it away at one point so yeah he's well aware of what he's doing
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:43.720]  really so so alec want oh i mean alec Baldwin uh goes on tv doing the diablo a lot yeah
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:51.000]  and and and then uh what you're saying he was doing it in leno's face and leno's
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:55.720]  oh he's behind reality the camera lens and and and eventually we're not to push it away
[2:44:55.720 --> 2:45:02.600]  good god what on the world is going i i guess they just love the power trip
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:05.960]  all they do they do especially when you're dealing with an ignorant public
[2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:13.560]  uh who are into the the mind control upgrading the general public have no reality at all except
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:19.560]  what comes across that media and that's what brazil's he said in between two ages in the 1970s
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:25.240]  he says the public are being trained to accept that the media is there to do their thinking
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:30.440]  and their reasoning for them this has been accomplished and this fear mongering again
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:34.920]  is a beta test of that within the polytano head of homeland security saying this probably won't
[2:45:34.920 --> 2:45:41.160]  be a big deal but another one's coming soon yeah is is is that to condition the subconscious to
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:46.200]  then think she's the great leader we can trust because after all she predicted it that's right
[2:45:46.200 --> 2:45:51.080]  that it's all stage set for for the general public too i think it's all quite a natural
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:55.560]  progression as this all comes forth and and the right people are put into the right positions
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:46:02.200]  to protect us we're being trained as children and to accept that we're children and to allow
[2:46:02.200 --> 2:46:08.120]  those mature special people the experts to to rule our whole lives from birth to death
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:13.160]  that's the whole point of the scientific era the century of change that's what it's all about
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:18.520]  and the elite they're willing to make the hard decision and give us the cancer virus injections
[2:46:18.520 --> 2:46:22.520]  and poison our water and you know the elite even say well the future doesn't need us and
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:26.680]  you know it's we just got to be cold-blooded and scientific that these people have to be
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:31.960]  cold and killed and and and then they'll even say look you even warn them alex and they don't
[2:46:31.960 --> 2:46:38.040]  listen they don't understand yeah so see that's the evidence so we have to go ahead and do this
[2:46:38.040 --> 2:46:44.600]  to them and it's just so sick to watch them mutate humanity and to take all of our weaknesses and
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:50.040]  to amplify them it's just so hella shallow and where do you see the economy going the next four
[2:46:50.040 --> 2:46:53.880]  or five months i mean it's really accelerating downwards they're saying the new bank of the
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:59.080]  world the carbon tax will save us as things get worse and worse as people begin to revolt yeah
[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:04.040]  well what do you see them doing launching new wars a new bio attack what do you see happening
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:10.360]  what they expect is what they've told us themselves the the u.s. military
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:16.440]  right after the british think tank for the british and nato military military
[2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:23.080]  brother's 90 page report for the next 50 years for scenarios of what's to happen
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:31.560]  they say there's going to be riots beginning around 2010 12 and they'll escalate there'll
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:39.960]  be riots over food riots over poverty riots over everything basically because they're bringing
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:46.360]  the western countries down financially into a sustainable living pattern that means vastly
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:51.160]  reduced consumption that's what's all through the united nations documentation from every one
[2:47:51.160 --> 2:47:57.640]  of their departments so this is what they have told us is going to happen so they're going to make
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:48:03.880]  it happen obviously and people will never revolt and this is the sad truth and until if there's
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:09.000]  if there's no organization people will not revolt and even then it's sporadic when they're against
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:16.440]  the wall that people don't like to to buck the system and fight and kill it's a nasty idea
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:23.800]  but unfortunately um if there's no organization against this you'll you'll have sporadic riots
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:29.320]  which is just a disorganized mob and they're already prepared for that they've been prepared
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:36.440]  preparing for this for 30 years by building up SWAT teams by bringing police into the
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:42.040]  multi-jurisdictional task forces sending them off to iraq by the way to get training bashing
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:46.760]  down doors it's been declared on canadian television lots of our cops have had this training
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:51.240]  and they work with the military in the same uniforms then they come back to canada
[2:48:51.240 --> 2:48:57.640]  and now they double up as the special SWAT and now they've announced on canadian tv and and print
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:49:01.880]  that all the army is just going to patrol the streets now to stop drunks and crime and yeah
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:06.840]  they announced the same thing here and you're right uh... and there is sporadic rioting and
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:12.040]  things that will only help them you know then tell the chicken neck fluoride head yuppies
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:16.280]  oh look see we need a police state because of rioting and they'll say that's what caused the
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:22.040]  stock market to plunge today was the rioting it wasn't the bankers it was the rioters jason
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:27.480]  bermas yeah it's absolutely ridiculous i mean they'll they'll make up any excuse for the economy
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:31.880]  failing i mean i had obama on stage in his fake state of the union saying you know what
[2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:36.120]  all these high school dropouts that's what's causing this economy to go down and that's just
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:39.880]  not going to be a choice anymore than you read the give act and you realize everybody's going
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:42.840]  to have to graduate high school as they're going through middle and high school they're going to
[2:49:42.840 --> 2:49:46.360]  have to do mandatory service on top of this you're going to have to go to a trade school
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:49.640]  after high school if you don't want to go there saying even if you're homeschooled you're going
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:54.200]  to have to show up and serve the feds alan this is going to be just a hellish system but i guess
[2:49:54.200 --> 2:50:00.040]  all the dumbed-down people who just bestially want authority they're going to love the uniforms
[2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:04.440]  and the power they're given to then parasite on the rest of us this is going to be sick that's
[2:50:04.440 --> 2:50:08.600]  true there's no doubt about it once you're in a uniform you're part of a fraternity
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:16.120]  that's why militaries have used this technique of of uniformity for so long you you are conditioned

[2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:48.760]  don't like the system and don't like what it's doing and are saying no to anything and everything
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:53.800]  they push i think there is a light at the end of the tunnel that is not an oncoming train

[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:08.600]  end of this is there any way to get out of this in your opinion um being led by specialists in
[2:55:08.600 --> 2:55:14.120]  every area of their lives and start reclaiming their own personal sovereignty to begin with
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:18.920]  is who we've been we've been conditioned not just in one generation but over a few generations
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:27.080]  that we are nothing special remember what but uh julian hoxley the first ceo of unesco said
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:33.320]  it said we have to condition the public uh and to get the use of the idea of the dehumanization
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:37.960]  of human life before that human life was the pinnacle of everyone had rights you were a
[2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:44.360]  spiritual physical being and just want to get rid of that idea and make them think they're just one
[2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:51.640]  other animal and through about oh 40 50 years of intense propaganda nature shows especially
[2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:56.360]  all put out by the big foundations we've been trained we're just another animal nothing special at
[2:55:56.360 --> 2:56:02.360]  all and because we're one of an animal we have specialist animals above us who are better animals
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:07.720]  more elitist animals and intellectuals we should obey those ones that's what the whole thing is
[2:56:07.720 --> 2:56:14.920]  that's right and humans are bad and we have to be punished and humans are a disease just like
[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:19.960]  that club of rum document from the early 90s written by uh the current head of the cfr
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:25.800]  richard in haas and it's it's it's more important the brainwashing even in the inner party isn't it
[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:31.880]  a lot of the higher level minions really believe they're doing a sacred work putting cancer viruses
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:36.520]  and vaccines yeah because we're bad they've got to kill us to save the earth and after all we're all
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:42.280]  just blobs we're all just animals and charles goten darwin put it straight out to the 1950s and he
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:48.840]  was a top physicist uh grandson of charles darwin he said that that that um uh we must
[2:56:49.720 --> 2:56:55.960]  eventually start either euthanizing or sterilizing the masses he says because otherwise they'll
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:57:00.840]  they'll bring their bad genes up into the good gene pool and destroy the good gene pool this is
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:07.400]  how they rationalize what they plan to do this ted turner one of the big propagandists for the
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:12.280]  united nations we think these guys are all independent they're not independent in fact they're
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:18.360]  brought up to be cultural leaders through the organizations and television systems and so on
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:25.640]  that they run ted turner says at the united nations he says a total population of 250 to 300
[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:33.400]  million people worldwide which is a 95 decline from present levels would be ideal and he's the
[2:57:33.400 --> 2:57:40.760]  founder of cnn and a major un donor and spokesman you know uh the club of rome and and their goals
[2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:46.600]  now they have goals for mankind this is not a wish list they have goals set during a 10
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:53.000]  20 50 year time period they have long-term goals this is a total population that they said the
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:59.240]  result in ideal sustainable population is hence more than 500 million but less than one billion
[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:04.280]  and that's in their own report called goal their goals for mankind we better realize that these
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:10.280]  kinds are deadly serious and they have the funding of the big uh five foundations including the
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:15.320]  rockefeller foundations to bring all this about and they're doing it alan want to do five more

[3:00:13.400 --> 3:00:17.160]  final single without a lot and we're going to focus in on some big 9-11 news you know if we
[3:00:17.160 --> 3:00:22.600]  can't let this bird flu hoax it's giving them a police state train the public for martial law
[3:00:22.600 --> 3:00:27.640]  always introducing that idea for different reasons terrorism bio attack natural flues
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:33.240]  we can't let that act as a smokescreen for the global carbon tax are trying to pass in the u.s
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:38.680]  the anti-gun treaties that will ban reloading and many types of rifles this is happening right now
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:44.520]  the new bank of the world being set up will pay our carbon taxes to the israel signal about to
[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:51.560]  attack iran it's all there pakistan and saying nukes are missing with no evidence totally made up
[3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:56.360]  we have to continue to focus on it all and to expose these people
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:00.200]  ellen why you were getting into their goals and what the eugenics i mean simple the eugenics
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:04.360]  has set up the world government on record they're getting their world government right now
[3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:09.880]  but not without a lot of people saying no but the establishment said as you know 75 80 years ago
[3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:15.560]  that there would be a lot of quote beautiful well-meaning people that had to die who would
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:21.240]  not want a new world order and then they see well so we're gonna kill you uh so but but again
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:26.680]  i really think that if we break the spell of mind control we can beat these people
[3:01:26.680 --> 3:01:31.160]  we'd have to and what we realize too is that these characters that claim that are the top
[3:01:31.720 --> 3:01:36.120]  go to the bathroom the same way as we do and because we're all the same things as they are
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:41.480]  not superhuman there are just human beings and psychopaths who do believe they believe they're
[3:01:41.480 --> 3:01:46.360]  superior but in all realities they're no more superior than any of us we're all pretty well
[3:01:46.360 --> 3:01:51.640]  the same so they have no right to dictate how we should live we have just as much much right to
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:02:00.120]  dictate our own way of living and and by ourselves but we claim that right and and say no get off my
[3:02:00.120 --> 3:02:07.720]  back uh you can't tell me what to do go back and and rule yourself i will rule myself that's what
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:14.920]  we have to do but but but and i agree with you they are hungry they oh yeah they love the power
[3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:19.320]  they love the control yeah there are a lot of good people that are actually more intelligent than them
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:23.800]  just good people aren't that hungry they don't enjoy crushing people they don't want more power
[3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:28.120]  once you get a nice house a decent car and great wife and kids you don't want anymore you don't
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:33.240]  want to go screw people to get things they do so i guess we've got to get our survival instinct to
[3:02:33.240 --> 3:02:38.920]  kick in we must do that and very very quickly and start caring about each other and about ourselves
[3:02:39.480 --> 3:02:45.720]  uh because you see that had a war on us and the family to isolate us all isolation from us or
[3:02:45.720 --> 3:02:50.680]  each other lost in front of computers tv but we don't talk and we've got to start communicating
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:56.120]  to each other and realize that we have people living around us that that we're supposed to
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:02.200]  communicate to and and be part of and care about and see when you have something to care about
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:07.160]  you will fight for it that's why that destroys the family good at men would fight for the family
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:11.560]  and they know that that's why the first target was the destruction of the family unit they said
[3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:17.960]  that their own writings cutting through the matrix dot com cutting through the matrix dot com tell
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:23.160]  folks your european mirror site for when you from the other one gets hacked yeah at alan
[3:03:23.160 --> 3:03:28.680]  watch sentient sentinels dot e you and they get pretty well everything it's on the sentinels of

[3:04:18.120 --> 3:04:23.560]  say uh to to gain more power over the public who have been petrified and punched drunk with
[3:04:23.560 --> 3:04:28.920]  conflicting uh uh documentation and when they're conflicted like that and punched drunk they're

[3:06:15.080 --> 3:06:20.520]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the
[3:06:20.520 --> 3:06:26.520]  american people while obama is already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if you have
[3:06:26.520 --> 3:06:32.360]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:39.320]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascist it's not about left or right
[3:06:39.320 --> 3:06:45.640]  it's about a one-world government this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told
[3:06:46.200 --> 3:06:53.400]  and his real agenda get your copy of the obama deception today at info wars dot com or downloaded

[3:06:59.240 --> 3:07:07.240]  hi my name is mz owner of ksco in santa cruz california and like alex jones i'm passionate
[3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:12.200]  about talk radio that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all i'm also passionate about
[3:07:12.200 --> 3:07:16.840]  helping people know the joys benefits and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs
[3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:22.040]  who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else or even worse for large companies
[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:26.440]  with no heart and soul nor loyalty to their employees if you're tired of being dependent
[3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:30.920]  on others for living and ready to start owning yourself loving your work and setting the sky
[3:07:30.920 --> 3:07:34.840]  as the limit for your earning potential i want you to know about an exciting great business
[3:07:34.840 --> 3:07:39.240]  opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose
[3:07:39.240 --> 3:07:43.080]  weight and can help them make money perhaps lots of it just by helping us spread the word about
[3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:47.400]  this wonderful unique product get on the web and go to chocolate dot own myself dot com that's
[3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:51.560]  chocolate dot own myself dot com and check out our opportunity you'll know pretty quick if you're
[3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:55.240]  interested if you are we will connect with you and get you up and running we don't want any money
[3:07:55.240 --> 3:07:59.960]  from you and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is remember chocolate dot own myself dot
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:12.760]  com ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network there are over a thousand
[3:08:12.760 --> 3:08:21.560]  architects engineers physicists scientists chemical engineers structural engineers and then airline
[3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:27.160]  pilots fighter pilots the former head of star wars program all coming out saying 9 11's and
[3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:32.920]  inside job the plane stood down the buildings were blown up the former german defense minister
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:38.360]  andres von mule we first interviewed him about seven years ago before his book was even out
[3:08:38.360 --> 3:08:44.040]  called the cia in 9 11 where he details how they did it like i want to get andres von mule back on
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:49.720]  and you know they're just counting on the american people not being able to face the heart of this
[3:08:49.720 --> 3:08:55.960]  but if they take 4300 plus foster kids declassified public and radiate them to death kids they'd
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:01.560]  stolen from parents killing them that's our own government they wouldn't kill 3000 people on 9 11
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:08.600]  to get a police state attack all these nations take our rights so uh this is what we're dealing with
[3:09:09.160 --> 3:09:15.080]  niles uh... herit is just an amazing individual he's one of many other scientists and these are
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:22.120]  published peer reviewed reports who are going out you know with the samples that have just uh
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:28.360]  you know the custody chain control and testing it and it's explosive thermate thermite residue in
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:36.360]  the towers now we've also had um the underwriting laboratories engineer on kevin ryan who saw their
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:43.080]  internal reports of the towers had to be blown up spoke out about it and got fired uh we have him
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:47.880]  coming out and pointing out that the key people at nest that are doing the whitewash just so happened
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:55.560]  to be of only a few dozen people the world experts for nasa and others and exploding thermate and it
[3:09:55.560 --> 3:10:03.400]  turns out unconventional uh insulation was put on in 99 in tower one two and seven where the cia was
[3:10:03.400 --> 3:10:10.520]  based in seven so very interesting to have that going on with just a basic investigation so niles
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:15.080]  herit been an associate professor of the department of chemistry university of coban agar for 37 years
[3:10:15.080 --> 3:10:22.040]  wrote a scientific peer uh paper with eight other authors titled uh active thermatic material
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:26.920]  discovered in dusk from the 911 world trade center catastrophe published in the open chemical
[3:10:26.920 --> 3:10:36.600]  physics journal uh the paper uh by herit concludes that the uh chips consisting of unreacted and
[3:10:36.600 --> 3:10:43.400]  partially reacted or detonated super thermite are present in the samples of the dust of hoffman's
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:49.320]  essays were written to help explain the findings of the paper to the layperson and to examine a
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:55.480]  hypothetical scenario involving uh the herit uh papers findings and there's links to all that at
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:11:01.800]  globalresearch.ca we have those up on info wars.com and president planet.com so professor niles herit
[3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:08.760]  uh joining us from university of coban agar thank you so much for coming on sir i'm here thank you
[3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:13.640]  for being on your show yes sir it's good to have you okay you got the floor tell us about the
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:18.360]  research the papers explosive thermite thermate what we're dealing with why you got into this
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:25.320]  research what the findings were well we're we're dealing with the dust which was produced when
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:32.120]  the world trade center collapsed these were thousands of thousands of tons that everybody has
[3:11:32.120 --> 3:11:41.000]  seen when the towers and building 7 came down now this dust when you see the material it's it's
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:49.560]  it's kind of dull gray olive green powder and if you imagine this in a plastic bag
[3:11:49.560 --> 3:11:59.240]  uh what we have done and other peoples have done was to take a very strong magnet and you pull it
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:06.520]  along the plastic bag and along with the magnet some stuff comes up the plastic bag when you
[3:12:07.080 --> 3:12:15.160]  when you pull the magnet up the back and when you and this is magnetic what you extract by the
[3:12:15.160 --> 3:12:22.360]  magnet is magnetic now if you take a look on whatever comes up with the magnet there are two very
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:31.800]  important components of whatever you extract by this one is some tiny spheres of what would you
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:40.680]  call them in english tiny balls tiny spheres is that uh yes sir yes sir but you know today i'm not
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:45.880]  too good at uh at english because i was getting your uh your uh name wrong i know it's um
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:53.480]  anneals uh herit so please continue professor yes uh there are these uh teeny little balls
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:58.680]  that are given off during the thermite thermate reaction as professor jones found but you separately
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:04.280]  did your own study on this and had similar findings so yes that's correct in english uh
[3:13:04.280 --> 3:13:12.040]  uh um go ahead professor that's the one thing and these tiny spheres are mainly composed of iron
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:20.440]  and they are in themselves approved that some thermite has been used because these are the
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:30.200]  remains of the thermite after the reaction this is reacted thermite now the new thing is that along
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:39.080]  with these middle irons spheres are some tiny we call them chips we call them red gray chips
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:45.960]  because they're red on one side and gray on the other side and the largest of these chips
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:55.480]  you can just see with a naked eye they're about one millimeter and but the but the majority of them
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:00.600]  are so small that you have to get them under a microscope in order to see them that is there
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:09.080]  less than a millimeter they want 10th of a millimeter and um and they they have a red side
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:16.440]  and they have a gray side now the red side is the interesting side in this connection because
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:26.120]  in that we have found the ingredients of thermite and the and the most important ingredients is iron
[3:14:26.120 --> 3:14:35.960]  oxide which one variety of iron oxide is rust and this is known by most people and the other component
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:46.520]  is aluminum now it's very important that these two ingredients are there as tiny tiny particles and
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:52.920]  those are the exact accelerant correct professor that makes normal thermite become explosive
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:15:02.440]  thermate correct no not quite okay go ahead because if we leave the thermite for a minute
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:09.480]  the thermate for a minute and you're mixing up thermite and thermate so so until further
[3:15:09.480 --> 3:15:16.680]  let me please let me call it thermite which is the material which has a lot of energy
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:26.360]  but this energy can come out either as heat or in a chemical reaction where you get a pressure
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:36.760]  where your gases is involved this is what happens in an explosive dynamite or tnt whatever
[3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:44.840]  in an explosive you have a reaction which gives off gases which has pressure which is a kind of a
[3:15:44.840 --> 3:15:53.240]  punch or you knock things into pieces a push a push okay it's a very hard push this is how an
[3:15:53.240 --> 3:16:01.240]  explosive works and the reaction the chemical reaction produces a gas at high pressure but the
[3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:08.920]  energy in the thermite can also be released as heat and and this is tremendous amount of heat
[3:16:08.920 --> 3:16:15.640]  if this this is the way it works the the point with the nanothermite is that the other stuff
[3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:23.560]  you you put in can make it work either way that is you can get the energy out of heat or you can
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:31.240]  get the energy out of pressure as an explosive and regarding the red chips we do not know
[3:16:32.120 --> 3:16:39.240]  actually what which function it has this has to be cleared up in the in future
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:46.040]  investigations but is this clearly a foreign substance i mean i mean you agree does your
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:53.000]  research concur or with professor steven jones research that this is the thermite reaction
[3:16:53.960 --> 3:16:59.000]  and that it has the same when they do that spectrographic analysis that it has the same
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:09.000]  signature as the thermite and thermate that they've tested excuse me i didn't get the question which
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:15.400]  what you mean signature this is thermite yes certainly should not be there yes okay exactly
[3:17:15.400 --> 3:17:22.760]  this is definite and it is very advanced the variety of thermite is nanothermite so this
[3:17:22.760 --> 3:17:29.720]  stuff definitely should not be there yes so major point or result of our conclusion is
[3:17:29.720 --> 3:17:36.040]  that those who put it there should tell us when how and why it got there well people professor
[3:17:36.040 --> 3:17:42.040]  always ask how could al-qaeda get into tower one and two and seven seven was fbi cia defense
[3:17:42.040 --> 3:17:49.880]  intelligence irs uh and uh what was a national security command center the largest cia sub base
[3:17:49.880 --> 3:17:56.200]  outside of landlady virginia uh in the world and i wonder how al-qaeda snuck into the cia base
[3:17:56.200 --> 3:18:00.600]  and did that i wonder why the media didn't make a big deal about this you know you got thermite
[3:18:00.600 --> 3:18:06.200]  in tower one and two and seven according to others who found it but but i mean i'm digressing
[3:18:06.200 --> 3:18:11.560]  here so so this is thermite it's in there other people found this and tested it uh what does this
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:20.680]  mean to you well this means well basically why could i can see this is we we can all
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:28.280]  agree that a crime was committed on september 11 this i guess everybody can agree upon and uh
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:35.800]  in my view this crime has never been probably investigated and far from solved so what we
[3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:45.800]  are providing a scientist with this work is is the forensic evidence for this investigation
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:53.240]  which has to come and if i may repeat that this stuff should not have been there in the dust
[3:18:54.680 --> 3:19:00.760]  that's obvious and those who put it there should should tell us how it got there and why it got
[3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:08.680]  there uh professor how does this sure go ahead yeah this is energetic materials and and if i
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:17.800]  may finish the thermite thermate discussion yes thermite is what i told you before thermite is
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:26.200]  the special variety of thermite in which you put sulfur in and it has the ability to lower
[3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:34.680]  the melting point of steel so this so if you put sulfur in the obvious purpose is to use the heat
[3:19:34.680 --> 3:19:42.760]  developed to melt steel and i think it's very obvious this is what happened on in the towers
[3:19:42.760 --> 3:19:48.280]  where you could see martin metal poor stay there professor uh professor harrod um
[3:19:48.280 --> 3:19:51.560]  neils harrod please stay with us we'll give out any websites or other key places where
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:55.800]  folks can read your paper we really appreciate you joining us back after this quick break we've

[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:27.720]  sure now that it's a hoax and we start seeing a bunch of deaths early this next week then
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:33.400]  still I mean the regular flu kills a lot more than that all this grandstanding all this is a
[3:24:33.400 --> 3:24:37.640]  big distraction from other issues like the one we're covering it now with professor
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:44.040]  Neal's heritage an amazing individual wrote a scientific paper with eight other authors
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:48.840]  titled active thermatic material discovered in dust the 911 World Trade Center professor before
[3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:53.640]  we go any further in this segment the next with you yeah are there any particular websites man
[3:24:53.640 --> 3:25:01.720]  I know global research about ca has your paper font posted I know that the journal of open chemical
[3:25:01.720 --> 3:25:07.240]  physics journal has it posted do you have a personal page or a site you'd like to tell people about
[3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:15.160]  no not really I'm sorry no that's great no no no I was just uh I mean just offering
[3:25:15.160 --> 3:25:19.960]  uh now now explain to us how did you get interested in this to research it and look at it
[3:25:19.960 --> 3:25:26.200]  well I got hooked on the 911 story when I saw building seven coming down
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:33.800]  and this was the revelation like I think it was two and a half year ago but accidentally
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:44.040]  I saw building seven going down on a video disc my wife had gone and from that moment on
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:51.400]  there has been no way back it's as simple as that if when you as a scientist see building seven going
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:59.560]  down you say what and then I had to push the button again and say what and I pushed the button 10 times
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:09.160]  and my jaw was hanging you know so and from that moment if you're a decent person there's no way
[3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:18.120]  back you cannot lie to yourself and say I haven't seen this and you and you and you wonder of course
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:27.800]  as a scientist why and how how does this happen because there's a phenomenon it is unexplainable
[3:26:27.800 --> 3:26:33.960]  on the background of the official conspiracy theory and I had never heard about building seven before
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:42.280]  that in itself is was an eye of now what is this and this was the this was Stephenie Jones
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:50.440]  you know the the lecture he first gave um on Brigham Young University yes the epic center there
[3:26:50.440 --> 3:26:57.400]  that was that lecture this was the first time I the situation at all caught my attention
[3:26:57.400 --> 3:27:06.520]  and from that moment on as I told you there's been no way back because I wasn't even up to
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:12.680]  say that if somebody stands up on a soapbox and tells the truth it would run by itself
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:19.640]  but the during the next month I found out that this was not the case yeah national news
[3:27:19.640 --> 3:27:25.720]  kind of hooked and and sucked even more into it yeah and then you find out more and more like
[3:27:25.720 --> 3:27:31.800]  BBC reported the tower seven had fallen before it fell and they reported exactly how it fell
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:37.800]  and so did CNN and then we found out they were fed a Reuters report of false scripting and then
[3:27:37.800 --> 3:27:43.320]  you just add the evidence on that but now you've gone gotten samples tested it it has this in it
[3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:49.000]  I'm sure you've seen since you've been researching the fact that NIST happens to have all these
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:55.960]  thermite explosive thermite experts working in it and and they're the people it seems covering up 9
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:28:03.720]  11 I I wonder why they're doing that well then there's an excellent paper by Kevin Ryan on on
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:11.400]  these relationships between different people and different laboratories and NIST but what I was I
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:20.840]  was I was pretty pretty fast sucked into the science aspect a World Trade Center and at some
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:28.520]  point felt the commitment of the scientists to to take care of that so maybe I guess I think
[3:28:28.520 --> 3:28:33.560]  probably the only person in Denmark who has actually read the NIST reports yeah you are
[3:28:33.560 --> 3:28:37.480]  sticking with that and we're gonna do a final segment we're about to break and just come back
[3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:41.160]  for 10 more minutes we're gonna cover the flu but uh professor it's you know we appreciate
[3:28:41.160 --> 3:28:47.480]  your courage you've been on national television now in the Netherlands it's the media is giving
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:54.280]  you attention other peer-reviewed journals are doing similar studies and the findings are yeah
[3:28:54.280 --> 3:29:00.040]  this was going on what type of response are you getting from people in Europe I know I've seen
[3:29:00.040 --> 3:29:06.120]  polls where the majority of people in Europe think it was an inside job actually it is it is it is
[3:29:06.120 --> 3:29:14.280]  boiling it's growing rapidly day by day and it's true I've been on national television and there
[3:29:14.280 --> 3:29:22.440]  are two clips actually one of them is posted has been posted on YouTube and seen by many people I
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:29.160]  realized and the other one is will be coming up very shortly I can announce oh good well stay there
[3:29:29.160 --> 3:29:34.840]  professor we've got a Niels Heret professor at the Department of Chemistry University of
[3:29:34.840 --> 3:29:39.960]  Copenhagen for 37 years uh joining us quick break that was a short segment come back with you sir
[3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:44.840]  talk about whatever you wish uh but what is the establishment gonna do is it comes out that
[3:29:44.840 --> 3:29:51.800]  those towers were blown sky high now what's gonna happen where's all this going stay with us we're
[3:29:51.800 --> 3:29:58.200]  on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:30:06.280]  you already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor
[3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:10.920]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts agree that the water you drink
[3:30:10.920 --> 3:30:16.280]  should be at a pH level of eight or higher alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique
[3:30:16.280 --> 3:30:21.720]  formula of the most alkaline ingredients using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make
[3:30:21.720 --> 3:30:27.080]  your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy simply put
[3:30:27.080 --> 3:30:32.680]  10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level alkalizing water
[3:30:32.680 --> 3:30:37.640]  helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:43.400]  disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment

[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:21.880]  completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:31:21.880 --> 3:31:27.640]  well obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election if you have a demagogue
[3:31:27.640 --> 3:31:33.240]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[3:31:33.240 --> 3:31:40.040]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about
[3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:47.240]  a one-world government this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told and his real

[3:32:01.320 --> 3:32:05.000]  hi this is peter crowns now both mightest resources as you know government spending
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:09.400]  is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise what are you doing right now to protect
[3:32:09.400 --> 3:32:13.960]  yourself financially as the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government
[3:32:13.960 --> 3:32:18.600]  intervention more people will lose their jobs and worse their life savings having your hard-earned
[3:32:18.600 --> 3:32:23.560]  money in banks the stock market or any other paper asset is a lose lose deal you'll lose on your
[3:32:23.560 --> 3:32:28.360]  capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue one thing
[3:32:28.360 --> 3:32:32.120]  is certain having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what
[3:32:32.120 --> 3:32:35.880]  happens your investment will never be worthless if you've been thinking about investing in the
[3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:42.920]  physical possession of precious metals i can help call me today peter crotch novel at 800-686-2237
[3:32:42.920 --> 3:32:47.960]  extension 108 and i will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect
[3:32:47.960 --> 3:32:54.680]  what you've worked so hard for call peter 800-686-2237 extension 108 you've worked hard your whole
[3:32:54.680 --> 3:33:00.440]  life and i want to work hard for you call 800-686-2237 extension 108
[3:33:00.440 --> 3:33:10.200]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[3:33:10.760 --> 3:33:13.880]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:33:20.760 --> 3:33:26.520]  all right huge new developments on the flu front coming up when our guest leaves us
[3:33:26.520 --> 3:33:33.480]  here in a few minutes but neils harrod professor over in the netherlands my parents favorite
[3:33:33.480 --> 3:33:37.000]  place to visit by the way in europe i've never been to been there but i've got to get i'll get
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:44.920]  over there sometime uh over there uh with um with all the great folks but uh okay professor i mean
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:48.840]  in closing where would you like to see this investigation go now because there's other
[3:33:48.840 --> 3:33:54.600]  scientists other engineers doing the same studies finding the same thing over and over again no way
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:33:59.080]  this should have been there uh you know we originally had the thermite hypothesis by
[3:33:59.080 --> 3:34:04.040]  steven jones because of the molten metal pouring out of the sides uh because of the
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:10.200]  oxidization the the sulfidation of the steel uh the you know then he found the little metal spheres
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:16.280]  that had the exact makeup of a thermite reaction uh and then he tested thermate it had that reaction
[3:34:16.840 --> 3:34:21.240]  uh and and now you've done separate studies as more and more of this comes out and it gets
[3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:28.280]  peer reviewed what is the establishment going to do well hopefully we'll get the investigation
[3:34:28.280 --> 3:34:36.360]  we've all been asking for for a long time and uh i appreciate of course the news value of the of
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:44.360]  this investigation but basically we're just we're just confirming what has been obvious for a long
[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:55.240]  long time as some of us know that the three skyscrapers in new york were demolished intentionally
[3:34:55.240 --> 3:35:05.160]  on september 11 2001 and hopefully or i'm sure absolutely i'm certain i can feel it that that
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:11.800]  those who know this is growing by vast numbers every day thousands of people every day so when
[3:35:11.800 --> 3:35:20.040]  we reach critical mass it will it will what would you call it provoke an investigation
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:25.880]  unless yeah well folks are waking up quicker to this and they did jfk that took 20 years to get
[3:35:25.880 --> 3:35:31.400]  a majority now it's over 90 percent and we can't wait for that i was about to say yeah go ahead
[3:35:31.400 --> 3:35:39.080]  we have to restore first of all the the power of the pressure as an independent institution in our
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:47.560]  democracy this is the most important thing to restore the press and before uh this is done
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:54.520]  we cannot stop the even larger issues at hand i agree with you i agree professor we've got to
[3:35:54.520 --> 3:35:59.160]  have the info war we've got to have the alternative media and the people's voice to tell the truth
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:02.920]  to ever counter this that's what we're trying to build here and we're starting to win that fight
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:07.080]  that's why bermas just walked up and showed me three more hit pieces on me today they are coming
[3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:11.320]  after us big time so folks pray for us we're in the thick of the storm here and speaking of that
[3:36:11.320 --> 3:36:15.640]  professor have you gotten any heat from the university or any threats from anybody from
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:22.440]  what you're doing no not really i mean the the the situation with university was settled
[3:36:22.440 --> 3:36:30.280]  almost a year ago in a way in a situation where i actually had the opportunity to lay down the fact
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:38.280]  for my colleague and they respect that of course so um so no that is not a problem
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:47.880]  and no real threats no no harassment and but there's and i have got i don't know how many emails
[3:36:47.880 --> 3:36:52.840]  since this paper come up and they are all supportive it's so nice of me if i let me get
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:59.240]  these opportunities whoever has sent me an email to thank him because i cannot answer all of them
[3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:09.080]  but they are 95 99% supportive yeah same here so they are there and this is fantastic i can hardly
[3:37:09.080 --> 3:37:13.880]  have time to respond to all of it and it's boiling in europe so i have to concentrate on what is
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:21.160]  happening around here and professor it's really moving faster and faster i can say that to everyone
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:26.440]  who's concerned about that yes a professor i was about to say what what's that your new area of
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:32.120]  investigation now that you have proven independently as others have scientifically that it's a thermite
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:37.080]  where do we go from here oh there's there's still a lot of things for us to do on the chips
[3:37:37.880 --> 3:37:43.880]  one thing is as we mentioned in the start we do not know if the thermite acts as what we call
[3:37:43.880 --> 3:37:52.280]  it in a sanitary that is only by the action of heat or if it's an explosive i i suppose that
[3:37:52.280 --> 3:37:58.680]  both varieties probably were in the towers and please notice that we are not saying that the
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:05.240]  towers was brought down exclusively by thermite all we're saying is the thermite is there it's
[3:38:05.240 --> 3:38:11.320]  still very well possible that conventional explosives were used in particular in the last
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:17.640]  stages but to me it's certain that thermite at least were used to weaken the steel structure
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:22.680]  because you could see the molten steel pouring out of the stout's tower minutes before it collapsed
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:30.840]  so so and this is one action possible action of thermite and then there's a variety called
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:39.640]  thermite which this guy Jonathan called Jonathan Barnett from Worcester Technology Institute
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:46.280]  found in the FEMA report so this is probably also there in my anticipation there could have
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:52.440]  been used a whole range of explosives and thermites for pulling down the towers and
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:39:00.440]  so yet we cannot exclude anything all we can say is that the thermite has been used there
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:04.680]  and it shouldn't have been there and those who put it there should tell us how and why it got there
[3:39:06.600 --> 3:39:10.920]  absolutely well we and then we have to investigate not just from your scientific angle of what's
[3:39:10.920 --> 3:39:14.440]  you know what's in the residue what's in the building and you're not the only scientists
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:18.200]  who have these findings now quite a few are doing this it's just you're very prestigious and also
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:22.440]  to prestigious university and and it's in europe so there's not as much demonization they did try
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:27.880]  to destroy Stephen Jones Kevin Ryan and others so they were kind of the ice breakers too they hit
[3:39:27.880 --> 3:39:34.840]  the ice first and you're still in the vanguard right behind them but uh yeah but uh this kind of
[3:39:34.840 --> 3:39:39.880]  this kind of harassment of what we call it personality killing around here of course i'm
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:47.960]  subjected to that but i really don't care i mean this i've got grandchildren six grandchildren
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:55.800]  and i'm on their side in this business and this is more important than i'm i'm too old to care
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:00.680]  you know that's a great feeling to know you're doing something for the right reasons for the
[3:40:00.680 --> 3:40:06.040]  truth and for your progeny and so many people are scared and they're frozen in this feeling of fear
[3:40:06.040 --> 3:40:10.600]  they're scared because they're not truly living and being honorable and folks we just stop caring
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:15.960]  and say look i don't care the chips fall where they may i'm telling the truth come hell or high water
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:22.920]  and i'm committed and that's the end of it yeah but i don't understand but i also understand those
[3:40:22.920 --> 3:40:30.680]  who uh who stay quiet i mean they have bills to pay and and they have a career very importantly
[3:40:30.680 --> 3:40:39.320]  so um we should not come down too hard on on those who i agree with you but if these terrorists
[3:40:39.320 --> 3:40:42.840]  aren't brought to justice the same people that did this are still running things today they're
[3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:47.320]  going to pull new scams they're pulling a new one right now with this ridiculous bird flu hoax
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:53.880]  pig flu hoax and so they're going to watch more wars you know we have got to look hitler as you
[3:40:53.880 --> 3:40:58.920]  know firebomb his own Reichstag attack Poland saying they they attacked his military basic
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:04.680]  lieowits we know that the u.s. government stages terror attacks we know the russians do it you
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:11.000]  know the public has to be educated i mean i have army field manual 2004 professor this public
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:17.400]  where they teach the army captains in special ops how to stage terror i mean staging terrorism and
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:23.960]  false flag is so inculcated into our culture into our government culture that they're teaching the
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:29.320]  captains they're teaching down to captain level that's a mid-level officer how to stage terror
[3:41:29.320 --> 3:41:39.400]  attacks yeah yeah well i i yes i agree but but i think i think thing will it will work out fine
[3:41:39.400 --> 3:41:48.200]  if we just consider this as a crime and so if people often i do a lot of talks with the
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:54.600]  the on and particularly on dog i'm building seven and i'm asked now why are you why do you do this
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:42:02.840]  and my first answer is well i'm against crime because who ain't so everybody can subscribe to that
[3:42:05.160 --> 3:42:13.160]  and i so i think if it's just if just justice is is established it will it will go automatically
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:20.360]  the rest of the way and 9 11 is really a window of opportunity it should be considered that
[3:42:21.080 --> 3:42:26.520]  is that it is it's a it's a window into the underbelly of this window of opportunity
[3:42:27.240 --> 3:42:34.280]  for turning things around in closing professor joining us from the netherlands uh

[3:54:35.080 --> 3:54:38.280]  is a complete hoax and that is good but we're not on the woods yet with these people because they
[3:54:38.280 --> 3:54:43.240]  could stage something else or they're saying some new flu could pop up and he's global
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:47.320]  slept a brag about what they're going to do to us beforehand jason bermas has a bunch of new
[3:54:47.320 --> 3:54:51.720]  developments on this front jason bermas you'll hear tonight nine to midnight central go ahead and
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:55.080]  tell us about it sure and we're going to be covering all these stories in depth we only have a few
[3:54:55.080 --> 3:54:59.560]  minutes right now but the top one or the top two anyway the first one is company warrant officials
[3:54:59.560 --> 3:55:05.320]  have flew eighteen days before alert was issued this is the veritech corporation and cdc cdc
[3:55:05.320 --> 3:55:10.440]  officials in atlanta said they were aware of veritech's claims but hadn't been working with
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:14.840]  the company now this just shows more prior knowledge we showed you the uh... company the
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:18.600]  nexican authorities knew on the eighteenth and they didn't do anything because it's nothing and
[3:55:18.600 --> 3:55:23.560]  then on the government's are hyping it to grandstand and to divert from the economic news and on
[3:55:23.560 --> 3:55:28.680]  the ninth they passed this big one hundred million dollar contract for pandemics and influenza
[3:55:28.680 --> 3:55:33.720]  with uh... what is it sanify event is and it turns out before then they knew it was coming
[3:55:33.720 --> 3:55:37.240]  and we're going to fear monger yeah exactly all but leave the borders open but they may have to
[3:55:37.240 --> 3:55:41.080]  lock down u.s cities now we're gonna leave the borders open but get to the next thing
[3:55:41.080 --> 3:55:47.320]  i have one person's got it but leave the borders open yeah this one is probably the most disturbing
[3:55:47.320 --> 3:55:52.920]  for me hong kong seals off hotel where h1n1 found a twenty five-year-old man had been staying there
[3:55:52.920 --> 3:55:58.200]  he had the symptoms so they immediately took him to some other secure location they quarantine both
[3:55:58.200 --> 3:56:02.840]  of his friends put them in isolation wards at another hospital but here's the really scary part
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:06.840]  alex uh... they're shutting the hotel down they're quarantining the hotel they're keeping all
[3:56:06.840 --> 3:56:11.800]  two hundred guests and a hundred staff members there for seven days you're not quarantining me
[3:56:11.800 --> 3:56:15.320]  i promise you that this is happening in other countries first but it's not out of the realm
[3:56:15.320 --> 3:56:21.640]  of possibility here when they're landing planes and dragging middle-aged women off with oxygen masks
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:26.680]  and has madder acting like it's outbreak or something and one person's died in the u.s
[3:56:26.680 --> 3:56:31.000]  hoax hoax but again there's a danger because they're talking about martial law force in
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  oculations even if you're not sick they are conditioning you for their next move all right so
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:41.800]  the next one uh... the world health organization is admitting that the existing vaccines are
[3:56:41.800 --> 3:56:45.160]  a little use against the new flu so you know uh... what is it it's uh...
[3:56:45.160 --> 3:56:49.560]  resin all-in-tama flu i believe it is or those are anti-viral drugs not yet exactly they're
[3:56:49.560 --> 3:56:53.640]  saying that they're not going to work so don't take them cdc is admitting that this virus
[3:56:53.640 --> 3:56:58.280]  does not have the genes that made the nineteen eighteen flu so deadly that's out of fox news so
[3:56:58.280 --> 3:57:01.640]  this isn't a big deal i keep telling people this is a mild
[3:57:01.640 --> 3:57:07.000]  flu this is not a real pandemic but then they turn around but they have death camps set up
[3:57:07.000 --> 3:57:12.760]  down the road in austin they're going well they put out these scare pieces here's a scare piece
[3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:17.800]  not scared of the flu yet online exhibit may help and then they link you to this on late exhibit
