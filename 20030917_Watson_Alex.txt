[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  Paul, from the United Kingdom, joining us, author of Order Out of Chaos that I've published.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  Paul, listening to the show today, how do you handle this psychologically with dealing with the facts and knowing this is documented?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]  Well, thanks for having me on the air again, Alex. Handling it is very difficult.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  I've been listening to the show for the past hour or so and you've been talking a lot about education and the control of education.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  It's interesting to look back at how the idea of compulsory schooling actually began.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  We can track this right back to the Napoleonic Wars.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  Compulsory schooling was basically born on the battlefield in, I think it was 1806 or around that time.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  The actual Prussian army was defeated by Napoleon and Prussia had to work out how they were being defeated.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  Kindergarten, they began kindergarten or intense brainwashing of children.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  Yeah, they had to work out how on earth they were losing every battle because they had the superior army.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  So they came to the conclusion that their defeat in the battle with Napoleon was caused by the natural human instinct not to kill other humans.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  This was boiled down to the fact that their soldiers were actually thinking for themselves.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  So they looked into the psychology behind this and came to the conclusion that free will was actually an inconvenience.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  They hired people like Wilhelm Wundt who was a top Illuminati programmer at the time very early on.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  They worked with him to program students in a compulsory schooling system to develop a sort of hive mind.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  And hence the Prussians became the best soldiers in the world.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  We adopted it here in the Marine Corps and the rest of it shaped heads chanting brainwashing.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  And folks, that's brainwashing.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  That's what cults do and it's giant cult programming and your cops are all cult programmed.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  I mean, we're living in a giant cult.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  Yeah, and you can trace it back right to the origins of mandatory schooling.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  By the way, this is in the encyclopedia, Paul.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  This isn't like something far out you're telling people.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  It's basic history and they use the same people that program their soldiers to develop this hive mind which would make them successful in battle.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  So the origin of public schooling is military grade battlefield based and so that's why we have to be wary of it today.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  Again, the news, everything is mechanized military run mind control.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  We're under a military psychological warfare dictatorship.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  What do we do, Paul?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]  How do we break out of this?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  Well, obviously the biggest thing is to expose the main planks of the attacking army and their propaganda.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  And obviously we're going to go on to talk about this.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  The main issue at the moment as it has been for the past two or three years is government sponsored terrorism.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  And there's been a flood of articles out of the British press mainly over the past six months about how the British establishment themselves
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  are funding training, bringing into the country these so-called al Qaeda cells to carry out attacks.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  And obviously we'll go on to talk about that.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  And now they've got the drills going on to condition you saying the massive attack is about to come.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  By the way, you better pass the Euro.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  This will keep you safe.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  The terrorists will get you if you don't give your rights up.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  Yeah, we need to preface this basically by trying to understand why the British government need to capitalize on a staged terrorist attack
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  at this particular time.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  Many of your listeners will notice that every surveillance or police state program that the British government are trying to introduce
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  at the moment is encountering fierce opposition on both sides of the political spectrum.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  We got the mandatory national ID card which was initially scheduled to be entered into British legislation this past summer.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  That's now been put back until the next session of parliament.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  And despite the fact that they're already beta testing the national ID card in small towns across the country.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  And the thumb scanners are going in and the cops say you got a thumb scan to buy and sell in hundreds of little towns, the mass conditioning has begun.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000]  And yeah, so to bypass this mass opposition against the conditioning, the British government then proposed the microchip biometric passport
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  which is essentially the same thing as the national ID card.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  Simultaneously the U.N. has called for it, the U.S. has, Belgium has unifying this system right now.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  Okay, well you just got to have this card to fly or travel or boat.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  Oh, now you got to have it to drive your car.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  And the characteristics of it are iris, facial, fingerprints, scans merged with key medical employment, other personal data.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  And now you're head of Scotland Yard wants a compulsory national DNA database.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  You must all report to give it when you get your driver's license or ID card that you'll have to have to leave your house.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  Same thing in the U.S. in Bill Clinton's 97 executive order to put clinics into all DPS units around the country to take your blood or urine at that point for DNA sampling
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  which will then be on a barcode on your ID.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  This is already federal law here in the U.S.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  And so you ask the question what do the government, the British government and all other governments need to achieve all this police state
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  in light of the fact that they're encountering a massive backlash against it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  Well obviously they need a large scale terrorist attack on London which will then enable them to pass emergency legislation containing all these nightmare laws.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000]  And so I mean we've got posted on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars today a BBC headline which reads,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  Terror laws are needless totalitarianism.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000]  And the quote from the article is that the measures would include allowing the government to rush through temporary legislation
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  without prior parliamentary approval.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]  And that's exactly what we saw with the Patriot Act.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  And by the way that's martial law folks.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  And we saw it with legislation passed immediately after the Omar bombing in 1998 which was obviously carried out by MI5 which we covered before.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]  Which is in your book my friends, stay there.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  We're going to come back and get into some of these key articles here and then start the third hour and get into more of it and take calls.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  We'll be right back, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:46.781 --> 00:07:04.781]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:11.781]  Alright, we're about to get into the news of British U.S. sponsored terror.
[00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:16.781]  That is by the private corrupt systems that control things.
[00:07:16.781 --> 00:07:22.781]  But I'm holding in my hand a copy of Order Out of Chaos, the least sponsored terrorism in the New World Order.
[00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:27.781]  And Watson, just in 60 seconds, tell folks what the book covers.
[00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:34.781]  Well, the book is very up to date because I only finished actually writing it a few months ago.
[00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:44.781]  Basically the book is a bullet point run through all the different facets of government-sponsored terrorism in the Order Out of Chaos scenario.
[00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:55.781]  So we've got everything from the agenda behind the war in Afghanistan, the agenda behind the war in Iraq, September 11, three chapters on September 11.
[00:07:55.781 --> 00:08:01.781]  Obviously a big plank is British intelligence state-sponsored terrorism.
[00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:11.781]  Pakistan, India, who armed them and why they may be the catapult into the next world war because of the nuclear situation.
[00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:30.781]  And then we go right through to the whole UFO movement, which via our research we found out that it's actually the UFO threat and the intergalactic threat is in fact a staged operation funded by the very names that we try to expose behind the New World Order.
[00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:32.781]  People like Rockefeller and Rothschild.
[00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:44.781]  I mean literally you've got Kansas City Star, Associated Press articles where Clinton's former Chief of Staff and this Rothschild run the fake UFO movement, these fake radio shows, all this stuff.
[00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:50.781]  It's in there folks, also Israel-sponsored terror, how they blow stuff up and blame it on people.
[00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.781]  I mean this is out of her rots and stuff.
[00:08:53.781 --> 00:09:01.781]  This is all documented folks, Order Out of Chaos, 1995, 300 plus pages long, full of documents and diagrams.
[00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:07.781]  Get a second book for $12 as a gift for friends or family or for Christmas, so $31.90 for two books.
[00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.781]  I published this book.
[00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:11.781]  I want you to get it.
[00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:12.781]  It's excellent.
[00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:17.781]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:24.781]  That's 888-253-3139 or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:34.781]  And you can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:09:34.781 --> 00:09:37.781]  The new film of course is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:38.781]  It's excellent as well.
[00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:42.781]  From PNAC to government-sponsored terror, it gets into all of it.
[00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:44.781]  And of course there's Road to Tyranny.
[00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:47.781]  Don't wait folks, get this information, get it out to people.
[00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.781]  And I am really proud of Order Out of Chaos.
[00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:50.781]  It's better than Descent to Tyranny.
[00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:54.781]  Descent to Tyranny is great, covers the history of government-sponsored terror, September 11.
[00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.781]  And the Police State, it's only $12, 230 pages.
[00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:03.781]  This is over 300 pages long, 1995, Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:06.781]  I want to come back and get into the MI5 terrorism and the rest of it.
[00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:11.781]  But what about this article that came out today from AFP?
[00:10:11.781 --> 00:10:16.781]  Asnar al-Islam leader threatens to document his links to the U.S.
[00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:21.781]  He's saying, hey, if you say we're a terrorist group, I'm going to expose that we warned the CIA about 9-11.
[00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:27.781]  That's just like the one Taliban guy who waited for U.S. forces and said, oh, I warned you about the attacks.
[00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:29.781]  And they arrested him but let all the others go.
[00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:31.781]  Break that down, Paul.
[00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:38.781]  Well, yeah, we've had numerous articles with similar circumstances where these terrorists are, in fact,
[00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:46.781]  documenting their links to British intelligence to try and avoid them being extradited, executed, whatever.
[00:10:46.781 --> 00:10:53.781]  And we had a recent article out of the London Times, actually, which the headline of which was
[00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:57.781]  Immigration officers let terrorists into UK.
[00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:06.781]  And the article described how an Algerian al-Qaeda cell who were identified as an al-Qaeda cell back in October of last year
[00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:16.781]  were not only given passports and allowed to enter the country, but were actually given jobs and access to secure areas at Heathrow Airport.
[00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:24.781]  We all remember Tony Blair had tanks rolling around Heathrow Airport back in February, citing unspecified threats.
[00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:30.781]  And then we find out that the threat itself was artificially created by the Blair government.
[00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:34.781]  Unbelievable. There's CIA. We'll talk about the Philippines.
[00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:40.781]  Admitted the government carries out the terror. I mean, it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:43.781]  Third hour straight ahead, your calls, and a lot of news.
[00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:49.781]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:11:50.321 --> 00:12:07.321]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:16.321]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:23.321]  Folks, we're talking about the most important subject concerning politics in your life.
[00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:31.321]  Government-sponsored terror. We're talking to a man who's researched it in depth, probably even more,
[00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:39.321]  in some areas than I have, Paul Watson, clubmaster, editor for PrisonPlanet.com, my website, and also we publish
[00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:43.321]  his book, Order Out of Chaos. Elite-sponsored terror in the New World Order. I know we have Barbara and others
[00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:47.321]  that are holding. If you'd like to join us in this hour, we'll talk about any news item concerning the
[00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:56.321]  globalist crime syndicates. 1-800-2599231. Now, it's come out that while Tony Blair had tanks all around
[00:12:56.321 --> 00:13:01.321]  Heathrow, St. Terris were about to attack, they had ordered their embassies to allow known al-Qaeda into
[00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:07.321]  the country, then giving them jobs and passes, MI5 did, British intelligence at the air base, at the
[00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:16.321]  international airport, and now it's coming out that people are coming out who've been captured and they're
[00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:21.321]  saying, look, I work for MI5 or MI6. The evidence is coming out. There's just a bunch of news on this.
[00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:29.321]  Let's go over it, Paul. Launch into it. What's going on here, and is the British public starting, the English
[00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:35.321]  public, I should say, are they starting to get what's going on? In some pockets, yes, because this stuff is
[00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:40.321]  obviously coming out in mainstream newspapers, but we mentioned just before the break, we had the
[00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:48.321]  headline out of the London Times, immigration officers let terrorists into UK. It was a known al-Qaeda
[00:13:48.321 --> 00:13:54.321]  cell, Algerian al-Qaeda cell, known as such in October last year, and they were allowed to enter the
[00:13:54.321 --> 00:14:00.321]  country, given passports, then given jobs at Heathrow airport, immediately after which we saw tanks
[00:14:00.321 --> 00:14:07.321]  rolling around right before the Iraq war to bully everyone into submission, and the interesting thing is
[00:14:07.321 --> 00:14:15.321]  that this actual cell was discovered in January, and so they managed to keep the story under wraps for
[00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:22.321]  nearly nine months that the British government had allowed this cell into the UK. I mean, something else
[00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:28.321]  that's come out recently we can take a look at is the article from the London Guardian with the headline
[00:14:28.321 --> 00:14:37.321]  Suspect Claims MI5 Can Clear His Name, and the article actually reads, quote, an alleged member of the
[00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:43.321]  bin Laden al-Qaeda network wanted in connection with the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa claimed
[00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:52.321]  yesterday he was in frequent touch with British security services, including a named MI5 agent, and we
[00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:59.321]  get into this sort of thing in Order Out of Chaos. We've talked before on the show about the case of Abu
[00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:07.321]  Qatada. Qatada was actually described as the European leader of the al-Qaeda network. It turns out he's
[00:15:07.321 --> 00:15:14.321]  really an MI5 agent in safe houses. Just unbelievable. Whatever happened to Tariq Aziz? They were going to
[00:15:14.321 --> 00:15:20.321]  give the Iraqi foreign minister a palace on one of Prince Charles' 100,000 acre pieces of property.
[00:15:20.321 --> 00:15:26.321]  Whatever happened to him? I don't know what happened to him, but yeah, the story came out that Prince Charles had
[00:15:26.321 --> 00:15:34.321]  graciously offered his palace to Tariq Aziz, and then we have every couple of weeks a new Saddam tape basically
[00:15:34.321 --> 00:15:42.321]  telling everyone to fight the U.S., and yet we can go back to the reports that came out in April of the fact that
[00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:50.321]  Saddam was actually paid off by the Americans and flown out with the help of Russia, and then we had...
[00:15:50.321 --> 00:15:55.321]  I tell you what, stay there. Let's go over that. I've got some other government-sponsored terror I want to cover with
[00:15:55.321 --> 00:16:01.321]  England, but then let's talk about how they claim that they caught the number two man's back last week with bin Laden,
[00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:06.321]  but then we have the article where they say they captured him 18 months ago. I mean, they've got to be doing this on
[00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:15.321]  purpose to just totally condition us to accept lies, Paul. I mean, why do you think their lies are so blatant where
[00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:22.321]  somebody with an ADIQ could figure this out? Well, obviously, as you mentioned earlier, they're trying to paint the
[00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:30.321]  Americans and British establishment as the bad guys, so then the U.N. can come in and take over. I mean, they tried to
[00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:37.321]  do that directly during the Clinton administration, but now it's the smokescreen behind this neocon front, but yeah,
[00:16:37.321 --> 00:16:45.321]  you mentioned the Iraqis. We've got chemical elite supposedly arrested a few weeks ago when it turns out he was
[00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:53.321]  actually captured in February, so not possible, I don't think. We'll be right back, folks. Stay with us.
[00:16:53.410 --> 00:17:09.730]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:18.730]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:26.730]  This is out of Dubai, A.F.P. The suspected leader of Kurdish Islamic extremist group
[00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:32.730]  threatened in an interview published Saturday to produce evidence of his contacts with Washington
[00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.730]  prior to the September 11th hijackings. I have in my possession irrefutable evidence
[00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.730]  against the Americans and I'm prepared to supply it. You won't be alive very long, buddy.
[00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.730]  They've already killed a bunch of Saudi Arabian princes that said that. In the United States,
[00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:51.730]  tries to implicate me in an affair linked to terrorism. Mullah Krakhar, if I'm pronouncing
[00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:59.730]  that right, who is believed to be a front for Asar al-Islam, told Al Hayat newspaper.
[00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.730]  He dismissed as fabrication reports linking his group to Al Qaeda, saying they were designed
[00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.730]  to justify a strike against Iraq. That's been proven now. Krakhar told the Arabic language
[00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.730]  daily that he had been approached by the United States for September 11th. I had a meeting
[00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:19.730]  with a CIA representative and someone from the American army in the town of Sumayyah
[00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:26.730]  or Iraqi Kurdistan. At the end of 2000, they asked us to collaborate with them, but we
[00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.730]  refused to do so, he said. British and U.S. news reports this week claimed that Krakhar,
[00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:37.730]  who has enjoyed political refugee status in Norway since 1991, and Asar al-Islam would
[00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:43.730]  be key elements of U.S. Secretary Colin Powell's group of links between Al Qaeda and Baghdad
[00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:49.730]  he presented to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. I thought we'd go back and talk
[00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:58.730]  about that. Now, Paul Watson from the United Kingdom. I want to talk to you about this
[00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:06.730]  and we're going to go to Barbara in Tennessee and others that are patiently holding at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:11.730]  But I know you watch the news. I know you read it. I taped the entire war. I mean, I
[00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.730]  taped about eight hours a day. Dozens of times, Wolfowitz said in press conferences, we paid
[00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.730]  off two major army groups. We paid off the Republican Guard. They're going to give up
[00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.730]  most of them. Come on, let's go into Iraq. After the war, he said, we never said that.
[00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:30.730]  That's totally made up. That's lies. To me, he didn't call on it. He said that they had
[00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.730]  killed Saddam's son three times. Then they showed us wax figures. They said they killed
[00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:40.730]  Saddam three times. They go on and on. Now they said that 18 months ago they captured
[00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:45.730]  bin Laden's right-hand man. Then they claimed that he'd been putting out threats again six
[00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.730]  months ago. Now he's doing it again. They claim they have him captured, but he's still
[00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:54.730]  putting out new threats with bin Laden. Then it turns out the tape is a fake, a compilation.
[00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.730]  Bush gives a speech last Wednesday, says you better pass Patriot Act 2. Bin Laden's going
[00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.730]  to be back. An hour later, bin Laden pops up on TV, I'm going to get you. Turns out
[00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:09.730]  that's fake, just like the fat bin Laden tape. Is it because they know that 70% of
[00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:16.730]  Americans don't know where Iraq is on a map? Is it because ... This is incredible. They
[00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.730]  could come up with better lies than this. Again, it's to demonize America and the UK,
[00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.730]  to play the part as the bad cop, to energize the UN. We know that. There's got to be more
[00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.730]  to this. Give us some examples of what I just talked about.
[00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:37.730]  Well, also 70% of Americans think that Saddam Hussein was involved with 9-1-1, and even
[00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.730]  people like Rumsfeld and Cheney have come out in the past few days and said that that's
[00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:47.730]  not the case, even though they used that as a pretext before the war. You mentioned the
[00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:54.730]  staged outcome of the war, with Saddam being flown out by the Russians. It's clear that
[00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.730]  the ... I mean, your listeners will remember the so-called ceasefire that we witnessed
[00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.730]  right in the middle of the war, when there was basically a seven- to ten-day break in
[00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:09.730]  any sort of major incident. That was when the deal actually took place that ensured
[00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.730]  the Swiss capture of Baghdad immediately afterwards.
[00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:18.730]  They admit that they flew out Republican guard generals, gold bars, euros, dollars. Rumsfeld
[00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.730]  said it before the war, and then he just said, I never said that. The guy was in front of
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.730]  100 cameras on national TV day after day, and then he said after the war, we didn't
[00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:34.730]  pay anybody off. That's not true. They fought. We just crushed them, and then they rolled
[00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.730]  into Baghdad in machine-gun minivans full of families and just randomly slaughtered
[00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.730]  everybody to act like there was some enemy. Then there was a response, and then they claimed
[00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.730]  the boogeyman bin Laden's doing it.
[00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.730]  Yeah, I mean, you remember before the war there was a broad effort to encourage Hussein
[00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.730]  and leading vast party officials to accept political asylum.
[00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.730]  Then he said he'd take it, and they said, we'll kill you if you try to leave. Then they
[00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.730]  had the ceasefire, gave it to him, flew him out to Belarus, and now we're going to have
[00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.730]  all these staged events.
[00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:12.730]  Actually, the so-called Battle for Baghdad, right before it immediately kicked off, mainstream
[00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.730]  newspapers were predicting that it would cost as many as 12,000 American troops' lives,
[00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.730]  and in the end it turned out to be a walkover. Well, why was it a walkover?
[00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.730]  The Middle Eastern newspapers reported that with the help of Russia, who flew them out
[00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.730]  of the country, top Ba'ath Party officials and Saddam Hussein himself were paid off by
[00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.730]  the Americans to order the Republican Guard, what was left of it, to stand down.
[00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:44.730]  You've got again today another Saddam Hussein tape, and we look at the previous tapes that
[00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:51.730]  have come out of these Arab television stations, where just about a week ago the bin Laden
[00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:57.730]  tape was a conglomeration of old footage featuring his so-called right-hand man, who again was
[00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.730]  arrested.
[00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.730]  By the way, that's now admitted, folks. They admit that, but see, that's the tiny paragraph
[00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:08.730]  in the back of the paper in the retraction. All the big headlines is what Dumbbell America
[00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.730]  remembers.
[00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:16.730]  And a major plank of the whole Iraq situation is the whistleblowers that have come out exposing
[00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.730]  the fact that it was a phony war in the first place.
[00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.730]  Well, let's remember that Saddam in 58 was hired, brought to Egypt, trained by the CIA
[00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.730]  publicly to commit assassinations. He did commit assassinations. He then was maneuvered
[00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:36.730]  in the 68, to be the head of the security force, the secret police of the Ba'ath. Then
[00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.730]  in what, 76, they put him into power. He was a big ally. They told him to invade Kuwait.
[00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.730]  They then cornered him. He didn't believe the invasion would begin. They launched the
[00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:48.730]  invasion. Then he was given the deal to leave. I mean, that's a fact, folks. Go ahead.
[00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.730]  And then the people that get in a high enough position of authority to blow the whistle
[00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:58.730]  on these sort of things, just like David Jailer did on the British funding of al-Qaeda to
[00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.730]  carry out political assassinations across the globe, those people are either imprisoned
[00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:09.730]  or murdered, with specific reference to David Kelly. And it is basically now obvious that
[00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:16.730]  it was a murder. And we have the article on PrisonPlanet.com from a well-known Scottish
[00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.730]  journalist who contacted me and asked that his name be withheld. And I checked out his
[00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.730]  credentials and found that he did write for the newspapers and magazines that he mentioned.
[00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:31.730]  And he told me that a reliable contact in the form of an ex-MI6 agent told him some
[00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.730]  interesting things regarding the circumstances of Dr. Kelly's death.
[00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.730]  Look, my dad boiled it down real simple. They killed him so everybody gets the message.
[00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.730]  Electrodes hanging off of him. I mean, come on, folks.
[00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:49.730]  And you have to remember that this has basically come out in the Hutton inquiry that Kelly
[00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:50.730]  was telling people, writing an email.
[00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:55.730]  I've got dark actors around me. I'm being threatened. I'm going to get my name back.
[00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.730]  Somebody's controlling my phone calls.
[00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.730]  And he was going back to Iraq afterwards, and he was looking forward to the wedding
[00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:08.730]  of his daughter. And the MI6 agent said that the murder, and that's what it is, a murder
[00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.730]  of David Kelly was, quote, sloppy work, and that there was an apparent struggle at the
[00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.730]  scene of the crime. And he said that it was sloppy work that Kelly's body was found with
[00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:23.730]  enough pills for an overdose, but he hadn't ingested them, and that the evidence should
[00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.730]  have been removed from the scene under, quote, normal procedure. And he also said that the
[00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.730]  heart monitor pads found on Kelly's chest, which he just mentioned, were simply there
[00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:41.730]  to make sure that he was dead. And this MI6 agent also said that those chest pads should
[00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:46.730]  have been removed, and he suspects the agents involved were disturbed by someone in the
[00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:47.730]  process of the killing.
[00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:52.730]  I don't agree with all this out in the open business, you know, saying we're never at
[00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.730]  war with East Asia. We've always been at war with East Asia. Big Brother will give you
[00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.730]  100 choco rations tomorrow. He never said he'd do that. He's only going to give you
[00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:05.730]  five choco rations. I mean, with this Orwellian on purpose lying, I believe, well, my dad
[00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:10.730]  is a pretty smart guy. He believes they probably used a defibrillator on him. And then you
[00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:15.730]  die over a few minutes, you still get substantial blood loss, cram the stuff in his mouth, you
[00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.730]  know, the pills, then they didn't get digested, slit the wrist. You get some spurting, which
[00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.730]  was described, not a lot of bleeding, that a guy with a heart problem, that a good way
[00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.730]  to kill somebody is with a defibrillator. But I don't know, you know, this is what your
[00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.730]  MI6 guy told you, so he may be right.
[00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.730]  Well, the end result of it is obviously what the British government planned all along.
[00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:38.730]  Have the Hutton inquiry, have the whitewash, and then sacrifice some lower-level minion
[00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.730]  like Jeff, who would brush the whole thing under the carpet and try and move on. So that's
[00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.730]  what we've got going on with the Kelly situation at the moment.
[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.730]  All right, we're going to come back and talk to Barbara and others, but I do have some
[00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:58.730]  other points I want to make. Paul, I mean, saying that there's a new tape of bin Laden's
[00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.730]  right-hand man when they admit they caught him captured 18 months ago but won't produce
[00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.730]  him, it's all just theater, they all work for them. To have Bush give a speech and say
[00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.730]  bin Laden's going to be back, he's going to get you, and bin Laden pops up an hour later
[00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:17.730]  on TV, a new tape comes out, to have Powell, before the war, before the Congress, saying
[00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.730]  there's a new tape on Al Jazeera where he says bin Laden says he works with Saddam,
[00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.730]  and then they go, well, that's not on TV right now. He goes, oh, it will be. I mean, talk
[00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.730]  about scripting.
[00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:34.730]  It is a complete joke, and we've had the situation with the Brooklyn Bridge so-called terrorist
[00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:38.730]  trying to cut the cable, like that would be possible. It would take him, like, 12 hours
[00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.730]  and he didn't even have the equipment, and then it turns out that he was an FBI spy.
[00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.730]  I mean, we have Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was supposedly another one of bin Laden's
[00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.730]  right-hand men. He was captured, and then it turns out, we look at the previous reports,
[00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.730]  that he'd already been captured and killed a year previously.
[00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:01.730]  And then now, since then, they've captured him again and again. I mean, it's like it's
[00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.730]  a joke. Oh, here's his face, and the news doesn't say, well, this is a retraction.
[00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:11.730]  We captured him again. We captured him again. We killed him again. We captured him again.
[00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:19.730]  This really is INGSOC. This really is Orwellian conditioning. Just to stay sane, as Winston
[00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:24.730]  said, you've almost got to become insane and just accept it. You know, two plus two
[00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.730]  could equal four or five or ten. You've got to see all the figures. They've got to be
[00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.730]  blurred when O'Brien holds them up to us.
[00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.730]  Are you beginning to double think, Paul?
[00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:41.730]  The key is just to try and, you know, have a memory. That's the basic tenet of trying
[00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.730]  to follow all this.
[00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:50.730]  Oh, it's just amazing. I mean, folks, this is so over the top. I mean, it's like a comedy
[00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.730]  skit or something. There's no way to describe. I didn't know why I could get this bad.
[00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.730]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:08.330]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.330]  a war on for your mind.
[00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.330]  So go to the calls.
[00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:23.330]  I've got a bunch of other news from today we're about to get to as well and get Paul
[00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:29.890]  Johnson's take on it, but remember, we've got a population that 70% of them don't know
[00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.330]  where Iraq is, and that was the middle of the war.
[00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.890]  So you try to explain to them that they keep recycling the same boogeymen over and over
[00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.890]  again.
[00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.610]  I mean, this is being done on purpose, folks.
[00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:48.450]  In 1984, Orwell, who was really Blair, had been in the police in India under the Imperials,
[00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.610]  been a communist.
[00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:51.610]  He'd done all this stuff.
[00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.610]  He'd worked for the BBC.
[00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.890]  He understood propaganda, and that's what his book was saying, is that they train you
[00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:57.890]  to accept lies.
[00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.890]  You know, you tell somebody, well, they're lying to us.
[00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.890]  Well, that's what they do, Mac.
[00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:06.450]  Well, you see, when people accept corruption, well, the SWAT teams killed other innocent
[00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:07.450]  people today.
[00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:08.450]  Well, that's just what they do.
[00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.450]  I don't want to hear about it.
[00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:14.690]  See, it's desensitization, a psychological process where they may start wearing clown
[00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:20.250]  outfits on TV and hopping around, and Bush may start sawing guns in half on TV and going,
[00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.250]  I'm pro-gun.
[00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.490]  I shouldn't joke, because when I joke, it then comes true, but, you know, he may come
[00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.650]  out in a devil outfit and say, I'm Jesus, and the Christians will go, hail him.
[00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.650]  He is the Christ.
[00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:37.370]  I mean, I shouldn't joke, but it's almost getting that ridiculous, and so, you know,
[00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.850]  let's hope it doesn't get that bad.
[00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.650]  You know, he may come out in an Anton LaVey devil outfit and say, this is how Jesus dresses,
[00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:47.490]  you know, blasphemous stuff like that, and they may go, that's Christian, you know, open
[00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.490]  the borders.
[00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.490]  It's conservative.
[00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.490]  More napping?
[00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.490]  Yeah, it's good for you.
[00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:56.490]  You know, it's just, I'm getting a little satirical here, but it's out of control.
[00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.290]  Let's talk to Barbara in Tennessee.
[00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.890]  Thanks for holding, then, and Melissa and Charles and others.
[00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.890]  Go ahead.
[00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.890]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:10.890]  I appreciate what Mr. Watson had to share concerning compulsory education over in France.
[00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.890]  It was Germany.
[00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:13.890]  It was Germany.
[00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.890]  After the early American Revolution, there was actually a group of French that had come
[00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:26.290]  over to America, and they attempted to establish a socialist kind of small society.
[00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.290]  And Jeffrey Dackins, in his book, History of the Secular Education in America, wrote
[00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.290]  about that.
[00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.290]  And it did work.
[00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:38.290]  It failed at the time, but they developed a plan where, over about 100 years or so,
[00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:43.290]  they would do away with the traditional American classroom that was still very much encouraging.
[00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:47.290]  Totally locally controlled, a classical learning system.
[00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:52.690]  And see, for those that don't know, Encyclopedia, kindergarten was a Prussian brainwashing system.
[00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:58.690]  The public schools are a cruel society, Nazi death cult system.
[00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:59.690]  Now, that's just history.
[00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.690]  Paul Watson, comments?
[00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:06.690]  Well, yeah, and we can, again, look back and find that people like Andrew Carnegie and
[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:13.690]  the same names that are behind the tax-exempt foundations now that are funding the left-wing
[00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:19.090]  disinformationists were, in fact, behind that original movement to create these brainwashing
[00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:24.090]  systems, licensing of academia, basically.
[00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:29.090]  So, from the very start, it was controlled right from the top of the pyramid.
[00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:34.090]  Yeah, before, if you could go in and take the bar test or go in and take the medical
[00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.090]  exam, you were a doctor.
[00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:40.090]  Before, if you had the facts and had the information, now would you have to have all their special
[00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.090]  accreditation?
[00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:48.490]  The USA Today article on Wednesday, September 3rd, it had a quote from Dennis Evans, who's
[00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:53.490]  the director of education leadership programs in the University of California in Irvine.
[00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:58.490]  And what he said was that public schools are the one place where all children of all people
[00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.490]  come together.
[00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:04.490]  There can be any more important, can there be any more important to teach each child
[00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:10.490]  and that's to the democratic society than to develop virtues and values such as respect
[00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.890]  for others and the ability to communicate and collaborate and an openness to diversity
[00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.890]  and new ideas.
[00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:20.890]  What that means is being a mindless jellyfish that only says yes to whatever they're told
[00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.890]  and has learned to be script searched and led around by somebody in a black ski mask.
[00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:25.890]  Right.
[00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:32.890]  And he said, furthermore, the isolation impact of home teaching is an anathema to socialization
[00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.890]  and citizenship.
[00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.890]  Oh, yeah.
[00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:39.890]  So, now, see, and they're moving to ban homeschooling as they win all the spelling bees and the
[00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.290]  corporations fight to get them.
[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.290]  Right.
[00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.290]  And he pointed out that...
[00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.290]  Give me that article.
[00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:45.290]  Who is this sicko?
[00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.290]  Dennis L. Evans.
[00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:52.290]  And he's the director of education leadership program in the University of California in
[00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.290]  Irvine.
[00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:54.290]  I mean, take USA Today.
[00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.290]  They're the ones that told you, yes, the U.N. runs our courts.
[00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.290]  It's good.
[00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:01.290]  And I heard the neocons on the radio going, well, it's not that bad.
[00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.290]  Bush is good.
[00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:06.290]  Comments about that, Paul, have they now announced that, yeah, our courts run under the U.N.
[00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:07.290]  Sure.
[00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.690]  Everything's under the authority of global, yeah.
[00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:16.690]  But going back to the education facet, I've actually got a quote from somebody called
[00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:21.690]  John Gatto, who was New York State Teacher of the Year for 1991.
[00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:27.690]  And he said in his own words, quote, I teach children not to care too much about anything,
[00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:29.690]  even though they want to make it appear that they do.
[00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.690]  How I do this is very subtle.
[00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:36.690]  I do it by demanding they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their
[00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:41.090]  rooms with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor.
[00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:46.090]  And it goes back to the whole Pavlovian Bell salivating condition process.
[00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.090]  Which the former head of policy said it was dog training.
[00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.090]  We're on the march.
[00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.090]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:59.090]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:22.859]  What restrains the government from becoming your absolute ruler, owning you, running
[00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:23.859]  your life?
[00:35:23.859 --> 00:35:28.700]  Well, having a bill of rights, having a constitution, being willing to stand up and defend those
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.180]  beliefs, that's what makes you a free human being.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:37.660]  History is a history of enslaved, feudal, serf populations on global reservations and
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.660]  plantations.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:43.819]  That's happening again, and it's all in the name of public safety.
[00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:49.100]  Well, your cell phone has a tracker chip in it now, your OnStar listens to you with Homeland
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.100]  Security for your safety.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.980]  We're having to put face-scanning cameras on to make you thumb-scan to get your school
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.420]  lunch or to go to the grocery store for your safety.
[00:35:58.259 --> 00:36:02.259]  We're going to have to call CPS out on any kid that's 10 pounds overweight.
[00:36:02.259 --> 00:36:04.180]  Now see, it's your social life.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.180]  It's what you do.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.140]  It's running your life.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.140]  We're going to go over all that.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.140]  Let's take some more calls.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.980]  We're talking to Paul Watson of Watered Out of Chaos and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.140]  Let's go ahead and talk to Melissa in Florida.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]  Melissa, go ahead.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.140]  Hi, Alex.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:27.400]  I just wanted to ask you, do you have any video or audio clips of Rumsfeld talking about
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.720]  9-1-1 being a blessing in disguise?
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.359]  I know he's made those comments.
[00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:41.680]  What we have is PNAC documents written beforehand, Project for the American Century calling Pearl
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.279]  Harbor a lucky event, saying we need more of those events and we need terror to mobilize.
[00:36:47.279 --> 00:36:51.200]  Where they talk about, Cheney talks about race-specific bioweapons, how good they are
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.520]  and how we need to use them and kill certain races.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.560]  That was in the September 2000 Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:06.040]  Watson, comments on PNAC and the psychopathic admissions there?
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.359]  We've got PNAC calling for a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:14.880]  We've got Bush saying that 9-1-1 enabled him to, quote, hit the trifecta.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.480]  We've got Bush coming out every few months saying that the hijackers are servants of
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480]  evil.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.880]  Well, the question is, who are their masters?
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.520]  He also said no one knows the power of this dark cult of evil.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]  Nobody knows the power.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]  He smiled when he said it.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.520]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.520]  I'm sorry, Watson.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.520]  Finish up.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.520]  I'll quit interrupting.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.520]  Go ahead.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:43.839]  In relation to 9-1-1 itself, some recent information that's come out relates to Flight 11, the
[00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:46.359]  first plane to hit the World Trade Center.
[00:37:46.359 --> 00:37:52.000]  Now, according to the official timeline, and we've gone through this before, the hijackers
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.920]  were running up and down the aisle on Flight 11, splitting people's throats.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.359]  And according to the initial FAA reports, which we later covered up, the hijackers supposedly
[00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.920]  actually shot one of the passengers.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.520]  And if all this noise and commotion was taking place, then the question is, why on earth
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.640]  did the pilot and the co-pilot not attempt to make radio contact?
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.160]  And in fact, the only time radio contact is made is when you hear the voices of the so-called
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.839]  hijackers.
[00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:24.080]  Why didn't the pilots punch in that three-digit code, alerting ground control to the hijack
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.080]  situation?
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.080]  Another question is, the FAA with Flight 11-
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.080]  Well, I mean, most of those pilots are former jet pilots and people.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.080]  I mean, these are tough guys.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.080]  I know pilots.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.080]  Can you imagine some Arabs running around with box cutters trying to do that?
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.080]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080]  But see, people haven't lived.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080]  They don't know where Iraq is.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080]  They've never been in a fist fight.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080]  They've never had somebody pull a knife on them.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.080]  I mean, I've had people pull a knife on me.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080]  Growing up in Dallas, stuff was rougher.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]  I'd beat the living daylights out of them.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.080]  Go ahead.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:47.080]  And then we've got another question concerning Flight 11, which is a cell phone call of flight
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.080]  attendants called Amy Sweeney.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.080]  And just to go through this quickly, this cell phone call, according to the official
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.080]  timeline, occurred just before the plane descended into Lower Manhattan, hitting the
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.080]  World Trade Center.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.080]  And so we have on the tape, Sweeney is heard describing water and buildings in Lower Manhattan
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.080]  and she says, I don't know.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.080]  I don't know.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]  I don't know.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]  I don't know.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]  I don't know.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]  I don't know.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]  I don't know.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.080]  I don't know.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:51.080]  if the pilots were supposedly still in control of the plane, and one last thing is that the
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.759]  only voice that can be heard screaming is that of Sweeney, the flight attendant herself,
[00:39:55.759 --> 00:39:57.759]  right before the plane hit.
[00:39:57.759 --> 00:40:02.840]  And so the question is can it be truly plausible that in the moments before crashing into North
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:08.359]  Tower of the World Trade Center, one flight attendant would, among nine other crew members
[00:40:08.359 --> 00:40:14.480]  and eighty-one passengers, be the only one heard basically shrieking in terror, right?
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.600]  And by the way, this is what they say, this is the same government that gave you Bin Laden
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:24.200]  that had gained a hundred pounds and had different nose and ears, the same government, the same
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.080]  media that can have Forrest Gump shaking hands with JFK.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.600]  That's right, from the official timeline.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.040]  You cannot believe any, it's their own statement that the plane was hijacked a hundred and
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:42.880]  fifty miles off course, forty-five minutes later, after flying all around the East Coast,
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.640]  off course, then it's hijacked seconds before.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640]  Anything else, Melissa?
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:54.319]  Yes, Alex, I have him right now, a minute clip of him saying that and saying that we
[00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:58.520]  should be grateful that three thousand people were killed instead of thirty to three hundred
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.520]  thousand through a biological attack.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.279]  The Building 7 Command Bunker did tell them to stay at their desk or they'd get in trouble.
[00:41:04.279 --> 00:41:06.279]  I guess they did try to keep the people there.
[00:41:06.279 --> 00:41:09.279]  Sure, go ahead and play his Lordship.
[00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:11.279]  Okay, hold on.
[00:41:11.279 --> 00:41:14.080]  Here she goes, folks.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:22.279]  This is his Lordship, Lord Rothschild's Minion, here he is.
[00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:29.920]  Interestingly, about, oh, a month or two after September 11th, I was in Oman meeting
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.040]  with the Sultan of Oman in a tent south of his country.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:41.960]  He was visiting his constituents and he said, you know, as terrible as September 11th was,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.440]  it may very well be that it's a blessing in disguise, and I said, how so?
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:54.200]  He said that it was terrible, the loss of three thousand human beings, but he said,
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:02.240]  if it will awake the world, if it will cause us to act, if it will cause people to stop
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:08.160]  people from teaching, it is a good thing to kill innocent men, women and children.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:14.200]  If that were to happen before we had a September 11th where not three thousand were killed
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:21.680]  but 30,000 or 300,000 through a biological attack or whatever, he said, then it would
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.680]  have served a useful purpose.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.680]  Did you hear that?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.040]  Oh, yeah, that's a sicko right there, and of course, a Carlaw Group is a big Rothschild
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.040]  Rockefeller front.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.680]  It owns the Saudis, and then when the Saudis were getting in trouble, they blacked out
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.040]  with four or five of the princes who were blowing the whistles on this, and MI6 is blowing
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:46.680]  stuff up and blaming it on them to destabilize the country, and to have him up there saying
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.319]  that, you know, that's what CFR member Gary Hart said a couple days after the attacks
[00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:52.319]  in Rode to Tyranny.
[00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:57.640]  He said, well, you need to use this disaster to get a new world order, and they said in
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.120]  the PENAC documents, we need this big disaster.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]  It's going to be helpful.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:08.520]  Paul Watson comments to Donald Rumsfeld, the Skeletor of the Defense Department.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.680]  Well, the thing you have to remember about Rumsfeld's activities on September 11th was
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:21.600]  that he officially stated that he only reacted to the attack after the Flight 77 had hit
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:27.680]  the Pentagon, and then later on, it comes out that Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, the
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:35.480]  whole bunch of the neocons were involved in a secret conference call immediately after
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.840]  the first plane Flight 711 hit the World Trade Center.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.799]  Well, actually, according to the news articles, Paul, they were, when they were hijacked,
[00:43:43.799 --> 00:43:49.600]  they were, and they were on loudspeakers giving orders to NORAD in the bunkers.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.040]  This is ABC News, and they won't release what the orders were, but it came out in one of
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.720]  the whitewash hearings, remember, I had the guest on, this came out in the New York News,
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.759]  that the spokeswoman for the FAA said that, oh, there was an interesting conference call
[00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:06.680]  before the first plane hit that morning with the FAA, NORAD, FEMA, and others, do you remember
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]  that, Paul?
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.560]  Yeah, and then we've got Rumsfeld saying he was basically giving the routine briefing
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.799]  in his office right up until Flight 711 hit the Pentagon, so again, he called a lot of
[00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:18.799]  people.
[00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:21.160]  And in truth, he did some command call telling folks, now, understand, the same time at that
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.480]  morning, 8.30 in the morning, they're running a drill of flying jets into buildings in New
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.880]  York and D.C., just so happens the CIA was.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.920]  Even if you buy that, I thought they said they never heard of planes flying into buildings.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.399]  Again, just lie after lie after lie, that's how they ordered NORAD to stand down, because
[00:44:35.399 --> 00:44:39.319]  every person in the military is an evil, it's just a drill, man, stand there, and then boom,
[00:44:39.319 --> 00:44:43.160]  the first plane hits, people are jumping up and down, shoot them down, shoot them down.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.040]  Hold on, folks, this is the vice president, I'm in control of the bunker, stay right there,
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.040]  mm-hmm, we'll handle this.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.399]  And then we have Bush in the limousine knowing about the first plane, then photos of him
[00:44:55.399 --> 00:45:00.840]  by the Times of London in there watching the TV, then going out reading a little goat story
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.799]  then acting like he just learned of it there, saying he just learned of it there, then the
[00:45:04.799 --> 00:45:08.480]  photos come out admitting he learned in the limo.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.840]  And then we've got a string of U.S. air bases dotted right along the path of the actual
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:20.040]  hijacked flights available to scramble squadrons of F-17 fighters to intercept the aircraft,
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.880]  so again, just lie upon lie, again.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:32.279]  Lie upon lie upon lie upon lie upon lie upon lie, but the average person, where's Iraqi?
[00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:38.240]  I don't know where that is, I mean, that's it, uh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, and that's who
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.520]  we're dealing with, Paul, just uh-duh-duh.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:51.480]  I take my quotes if they say to, I put, I put, I have national ID card, I mean, how
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.920]  do you counter something like that?
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:58.480]  Well, you just have to basically ignore the chaff and try and connect with the people
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.560]  that still have some semblance of intelligence left in their brain, which is the main course
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:08.440]  of action, but again, very difficult with the cultural effect of the dumbing down which
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440]  is going on.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.160]  I mean, you've got Britney Spears coming out and saying that anyone who doesn't agree with
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:21.279]  everything George Bush says is basically a terrorist, and so it's infiltrated right into
[00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.759]  the culture, it's the cultural government link that's...
[00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:27.080]  Yeah, and this is the government pushing all this, I mean, I heard Fox Radio this morning,
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.640]  it was, I heard five minutes of it, it was all about what they do with, uh, with, with
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:38.200]  the porno actresses, uh, men cheating on their wives, nothing about sports, mindless idiot
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.319]  callers, and, uh, and then you look at what they're promoting, Britney Spears dancing
[00:46:43.319 --> 00:46:49.240]  around with a snake kissing Madonna, Madonna puts out a children's book, uh, you know,
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.200]  and then people say, oh, that's the liberals, I mean, it's Viacom, it's, oh, yeah, it is,
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:59.080]  but the worst stuff's coming out of Fox, where every male role model is an idiot, a family's
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:05.279]  breaking down, Temptation Island, I mean, wake up, people.
[00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:09.799]  And then you've got people like, uh, Christina Aguilera, along with Britney Spears and all
[00:47:09.799 --> 00:47:15.480]  the rest, writing songs about how it's okay for women to be whores, and this whole cultural
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.840]  moral attack is based at making people relinquish their very morals, so...
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.200]  And by the way, for people out there, young people out there, they're not just trying
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.960]  to sell you drugs or clothing or whatever, they want to destroy you when you're young
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.520]  and stupid, they want to make sure you burn your brains out, they want to make sure you
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:39.279]  end up in prison building widgets for Wackenhut, they want to ruin you, and the, and the incredible
[00:47:39.279 --> 00:47:44.640]  gift of God of being married and having children and being grandparents and leaving something
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.440]  and transmitting information to the next generation, they are destroying civilization.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.359]  They want to turn us into a bunch of idiots.
[00:47:52.359 --> 00:47:57.680]  Well, it's basically the very elimination of common sense whereby the counterculture
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.160]  is proposed as being completely out of your mind, when in fact that is exactly what the
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.160]  government wants you to be.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:10.880]  So the elimination of common sense is a major attack arm of this anti-moral crusade that
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.880]  the government is funding.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:16.200]  And let me tell you, these inbred Rockefellers and Rothschilds hate it when they see happy
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.120]  families at the swimming pool and beautiful art and creativity.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.319]  They hate your guts, people.
[00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:24.600]  They want to destroy you.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.480]  They've said it.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.920]  Because if they don't dumb you down, rival elites will form that will get ahold of the
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.560]  life-assisted technologies, that will get ahold of the alternative energies, and that
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:40.120]  our progeny will have a chance to go to the stars and really enjoy God's gift of humanity.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.399]  We're made in the image of God.
[00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:42.880]  They want to rape that.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.920]  They hate your guts.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.640]  These people want to destroy everything.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:53.279]  These sickos want to destroy humanity itself, and I am not going to sit here and put up
[00:48:53.279 --> 00:48:54.279]  with them, Paul.
[00:48:54.279 --> 00:48:55.279]  What about you?
[00:48:55.279 --> 00:48:56.279]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[00:48:56.279 --> 00:49:02.560]  I mean, people say that, I mean, we're, you know, sort of too traditional or something
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.560]  like that.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:07.600]  But in fact, it's not we that have shifted our views, it's the whole political spectrum
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.600]  that's shifted.
[00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:12.120]  Traditional is a survival mechanism.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:18.680]  That's the point, and they've shifted the whole paradigm towards this out-of-your-mind
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:24.240]  completely delusional scenario where it's sort of a reaction against the traditional
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.240]  establishment when you in fact find out that the establishment is not traditional because
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.240]  it's been hijacked.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240]  That's it.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:38.200]  They're encoding your psychology with death, selling you death, death, death, death, death.
[00:49:38.799 --> 00:49:39.799]  Wake up!
[00:49:39.799 --> 00:49:40.799]  Say no to death!
[00:49:41.799 --> 00:49:49.799]  And we've got the latest generation of children's dolls or hip-hop girls with short miniskirts,
[00:49:49.799 --> 00:49:52.799]  tattoos, nose rings, and things like this.
[00:49:52.799 --> 00:49:57.000]  And this is coming right out of corporations like Mattel, which originally introduced the
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]  Barbie dolls.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.200]  So even right down to the children's toys, I mean, we have the picture of the Lego world
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.200]  surveillance truck with all the high-tech surveillance equipment on it.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.200]  So does the police all have hateful faces?
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.200]  Yeah, right down to that level, it's being brought in through the children.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]  Oh, it's incredible.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.200]  I mean, some of these articles I've got here in front of me.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.200]  Kofi Annon yesterday says, in the U.N. Newswire, we must give in to a global government.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.200]  National sovereignty must end.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]  I mean, that's right out in the open.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.200]  But Russ Limbaugh says there is no global government.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.200]  If you say it, you're a kook.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.200]  It doesn't exist.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.200]  And then you can follow the actual Vatican Newswire as well.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.200]  They're basically coming out with the same thing each week, submit the global government,
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.200]  unite in the face of, you know, terrorism and all this stuff.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.200]  So right down to the Vatican itself in alliance with the U.N.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:53.200]  I don't think people realize, Paul, what it means when on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, it's the
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:51:00.200]  same ads, the same statements, the same teleprompter messages in the same order.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.200]  Same thing as well.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]  Same thing as well.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:08.200]  The news in America is, in fact, more commercial than it is in this country because, I mean,
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.200]  you listen to a news broadcast on American radio.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:14.200]  Every five minutes they have a message from the sponsor.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:22.200]  And it's either to do with CPS grabbing kids or, you know, on-store protecting somebody.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.200]  So the news is littered with these examples.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:31.200]  So it's a fusion between corporations and government that is forcing this down our necks.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.200]  Put your neighbor.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200]  Do they have guns?
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.200]  Do they have drugs?
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.200]  Are they not nice to the child?
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200]  Give them to us.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.200]  We're five times more likely to abuse them.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.200]  Never mind those numbers.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.200]  Have you heard that Neocon star piece we hear?
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]  Yeah.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.200]  That pretty much puts the bottom line on it.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]  Yeah.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.200]  I want to put that on prison planning.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.200]  Think you can find that and put it on?
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.200]  Yeah.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200]  Sure.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]  All right.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:00.200]  And I want to pull that interview with that fellow with the public school down in Louisiana
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]  because I'm getting those documents.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.200]  I saw the news articles on it.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.200]  But I'm getting these documents.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:09.200]  And then once you post the audio link, I'll scan in those documents and post that.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.200]  Okay.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.200]  We'll post it all together.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.200]  Yeah.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.200]  Because you're doing a great job at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:19.200]  And I want to come back and hit a few final news articles.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.200]  Administration creates Center for Massacre Terror watch list.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:29.200]  And it says it will be people who have ties to domestic events like violence at abortion clinics.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.200]  And it says pro-life movements, gun owners.
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.200]  This is the new terror watch list.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.200]  As we warned you, will be homeschoolers, gun owners.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.200]  And that's right out of the New York Times.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200]  Sounds good, doesn't it?
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.200]  Yeah.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.200]  Fused in with Homeland Security as well to watch American citizens.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.200]  But I thought they said it wasn't for citizens.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.200]  Believe the lie.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.200]  Well, Section 802 says it's directly for all misdemeanors.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.200]  And it actually says in the new Patriot Act they can secretly arrest you, torture you,
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.200]  and then blow your head off.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.200]  That's freedom.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:06.200]  That's what the veterans fought for.
[00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:29.670]  I have the book, Order Out of Chaos, in my hands.
[00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:30.670]  You need to have one.
[00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:31.670]  Written by Paul Watson.
[00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:33.750]  It is excellent.
[00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:36.750]  1995, 330 plus pages.
[00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.750]  Get a second copy for only $12.
[00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.750]  $31.90 to get two copies of the book.
[00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:45.750]  1995 to get one copy.
[00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:46.750]  Get it as a gift.
[00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:47.750]  Get one for yourself.
[00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:48.750]  One as a gift.
[00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.750]  Get my new film, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.750]  If you want to just have an overall view of how sick these people are,
[00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.750]  with their own admissions.
[00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:00.750]  You need to get the videos.
[00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:01.830]  You need to get the books.
[00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.830]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:10.830]  Or call Till Free right now at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:14.830]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.830]  If you won't support what we're doing, but most importantly get the films,
[00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:20.830]  get the books, get them out to people, the globalists are going to win.
[00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:26.830]  If you can just deprogram people, that hey, face scanning cameras aren't good.
[00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:28.830]  Hey, open borders aren't good.
[00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:29.830]  We can save this country.
[00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:33.910]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:41.910]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:44.910]  Or PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com.
[00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:45.910]  Don't wait.
[00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:49.910]  Join us in the Second American Restoration trying to get freedom back,
[00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:53.910]  folks, against the scientifically crafted social engineers
[00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.910]  that want you psychologically, spiritually, physically out of the way
[00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:58.910]  so they can inherit the earth.
[00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:00.990]  We cannot put up with that.
[00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.990]  Administration creates a Center for Master Terror watch list.
[00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:05.990]  Under this you'll have no rights.
[00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:08.990]  Of course, in checkpoints everywhere you'll be coded.
[00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.990]  And it says Christians, homeschoolers, gun owners,
[00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.990]  folks that have protested abortion.
[00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.990]  You're going to love it, folks.
[00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.990]  You're going to love the new conservatism.
[00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.990]  Don't worry.
[00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:20.990]  Terror laws are needless to totalitarianism.
[00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:22.990]  BBC admits it's all fake.
[00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:26.990]  Ridge to appeal to citizenry for thoughts on homeland security.
[00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.990]  That's Delphi Method.
[00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:29.070]  They're not appealing.
[00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.070]  These aren't town hall meetings.
[00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:32.070]  These are staged.
[00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:37.070]  French accuse MI5 of failing to help hunt terrorists.
[00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:41.070]  Public meeting on Patriot Act criticized over limited seating.
[00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.070]  Arizona Central, as I said, these aren't real public hearings.
[00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:46.070]  They're now having to admit the public's to them.
[00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.070]  These aren't real.
[00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.070]  You don't let the public in.
[00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:50.070]  You let 100 cops in and call it a public meeting.
[00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:52.070]  They'll, oh, look, everybody's for it.
[00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:54.070]  Paul Watson comments on that.
[00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.150]  He thinks it's completely staged.
[00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.150]  We had news reporting that top officials in the Bush
[00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.150]  administration had been ordered to write editorial the week
[00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.150]  before lauding the virtues of the Patriot Act,
[00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.150]  and then we have Ashcroft on this nationwide tour.
[00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:15.150]  Meanwhile, he's telling everyone that opposes the Patriot Act
[00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.150]  that they're engaging in hysterics.
[00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:20.150]  So, again, to paint everyone that cares about freedom
[00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:22.150]  as being complete kook.
[00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.230]  As they announce in the mainstream news
[00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:29.230]  from the subsections that misdemeanors, abortion protesting,
[00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.230]  protesting, it's all terrorists.
[00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:35.230]  Bush totally against scrapping H1B visas.
[00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.230]  They say this is going to get seven times worse
[00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:39.230]  in the next five years.
[00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.230]  Seven times.
[00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.230]  You think it's bad now, high-tech folks.
[00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:43.230]  Comments to that.
[00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.230]  I mean, they told us napping guests.
[00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:46.230]  Great, Paul.
[00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:50.230]  Well, yeah, the outsourcing is announced to increase seven times
[00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:54.310]  and we've even got these employees on slave wages in India
[00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:58.310]  being trained about the weather in America and Britain
[00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:01.310]  and what's happening in the TV soaps just to appear
[00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.310]  as if they're from, you know, America or Britain.
[00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:07.310]  At the Republican Party, when a fundraiser calls you,
[00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:10.310]  it's a guy who's been trained with a fake American accent
[00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:11.310]  from India.
[00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:12.310]  Completely fake.
[00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.310]  They're completely trained to fool people into thinking
[00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.310]  that it's all American or British based.
[00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:19.390]  Here's another one.
[00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:21.390]  Arkansas took two great kids on obesity.
[00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:22.390]  Your kid's fat.
[00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:23.390]  CPS is going to take him.
[00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:24.390]  Son of Sentinel.
[00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:27.390]  New terror laws used versus common criminals.
[00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.390]  ABC News admitting it.
[00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:33.390]  Oh, man, and I did a flashback on Infowars.com
[00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:35.390]  about what the Patriot Act really does.
[00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:36.390]  Their own admissions.
[00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:39.390]  Justice Department said it's for all, everybody.
[00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:42.390]  And then they say you're crazy if you say it isn't.
[00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:44.390]  Paul, I really want to thank you for coming on
[00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:45.390]  and all your great work
[00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:47.390]  and I really enjoy having you on the show.
[00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:50.470]  For your insight, I hope folks visit PrisonPlanet.com
[00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.470]  to see your fine work, my friend.
[00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:53.470]  Okay, thanks a lot.
[00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.470]  I appreciate it.
[00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.470]  You bet.
[00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:56.470]  Great job on order out of chaos.
[00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:57.470]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.470]  Tell your friends and family about the show.
[00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.470]  Spread the word.
[00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:01.470]  Educate yourselves.
[00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:03.470]  Stand up against this tyranny.
[00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.470]  Defend the core of humanity,
[00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.470]  the human soul against the devil.
[00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.470]  Through the years of providing water filters to America,
[00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.470]  you've come to us...
[00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.509]  you
