[01:07.580 --> 01:12.220]  here sunday okay where to begin i came in here this morning and looked at all
[01:12.220 --> 01:15.900]  the news and the stack i didn't cover yesterday and i kind of mad at myself i
[01:15.900 --> 01:20.380]  mean we cover a lot of news but i kind of perseverate on certain topics more
[01:20.380 --> 01:25.500]  than others there's just so much to get into first and foremost obama is going
[01:25.500 --> 01:30.980]  to be in a summit today tomorrow and probably on friday and the headline is
[01:30.980 --> 01:35.740]  obama's summit aims to battle extremists islamic and otherwise and that
[01:35.740 --> 01:39.100]  headlines basically everywhere this is from c&m we have a clip of that coming
[01:39.100 --> 01:46.820]  up and it goes on to say that he will not call them islamic in fact c&m this
[01:46.820 --> 01:53.380]  morning very early this morning when i sent this clip to nico it said obama
[01:53.380 --> 01:58.980]  will not call islamicist extremist that was the headline and then i just came
[01:58.980 --> 02:05.940]  in here in my stack and it's been changed to obama's summit aims to battle
[02:05.940 --> 02:11.540]  extremist islamic and otherwise did you notice that nico or it already changed
[02:11.540 --> 02:16.700]  for you by the time you printed that article that's one reason you were just
[02:16.700 --> 02:19.860]  on air right he's gonna check his phone but he was just on air right here at a
[02:19.860 --> 02:23.620]  microphone station that goes on air okay i just more and more when you guys talk
[02:23.620 --> 02:30.260]  i want to get you on air it sounds like i'm crazy right okay fantastic um that's
[02:30.260 --> 02:34.580]  just wild that's why i print the articles off because they pull stuff out of
[02:34.580 --> 02:37.940]  them they change the headlines and that's our headline that's what it is
[02:37.940 --> 02:44.580]  obama will not call islamicist extremist and they're saying that the
[02:44.580 --> 02:50.140]  entire conference is about battling extremist and of course homeland security
[02:50.140 --> 02:56.140]  says the main threat is domestic gut owners veterans libertarians pro-lifers
[02:56.140 --> 03:02.140]  so paul watson's working on a story on that front right now a neocon think tank
[03:02.140 --> 03:06.860]  floats isis invasion of europe by c well actually they're just letting all the
[03:06.860 --> 03:10.020]  radicals in right through the border patrol checkpoints so it's the
[03:10.020 --> 03:13.900]  government's orchestrating it not not some d-day invasion darpa developing
[03:13.900 --> 03:20.380]  matrix like brain implants powered from the spine remember i told you about
[03:20.380 --> 03:24.580]  transmitter chips in the spines of trips i mentioned that last week when a
[03:24.580 --> 03:28.180]  caller called in and the military saying he had a chip and i said was it in the
[03:28.180 --> 03:33.700]  spine and he'd heard of some of them getting them in the spine but said no he
[03:33.700 --> 03:39.980]  got his in his shoulder i was told by high-level folks which is that they had
[03:39.980 --> 03:45.100]  chips powered by the spine and boom it's in the news today i said that last week
[03:45.100 --> 03:49.660]  on record i saw commenters on youtube going oh yeah you knew it was in the
[03:49.660 --> 03:55.420]  spine not till he said it sorry i said it i said it i said it and i hadn't said
[03:55.420 --> 03:58.740]  it before because the public isn't ready to hear stuff like this and if i can't
[03:58.740 --> 04:02.140]  document something i don't go there

[04:17.700 --> 04:22.900]  looked it up and found Saudi Arabia proposing it four years ago i didn't
[04:22.900 --> 04:25.660]  even know that
[04:26.220 --> 04:31.300]  kind of like i was with david not on the air the other day talking and you know
[04:31.300 --> 04:34.820]  i was talking to buckley my cousin i wasn't even aware that the drones the
[04:34.820 --> 04:38.620]  toy drones already have gps in them to not let them fly certain places i was
[04:38.620 --> 04:42.220]  like i bet they use that gps to block it flying certain places they go oh sorry
[04:42.220 --> 04:46.300]  that's already done here's the article it's not that i'm even smart i figured

[09:13.420 --> 09:16.860]  will this makes my head explode that your television could be e-dropping on
[09:16.860 --> 09:21.420]  your conversations and then sharing it over the web all the cars now have
[09:21.420 --> 09:24.980]  tracker boxes that can remote control your vehicle in them the Justice
[09:24.980 --> 09:28.940]  Department is building a national database to track in real time the
[09:28.940 --> 09:32.660]  movement of vehicles around the US storing hundreds of millions of
[09:32.660 --> 09:36.260]  records about motorists it's like the elite or space aliens or something with
[09:36.260 --> 09:40.540]  a master plan it's so evil it's so sadistic no it's the devil I mean
[09:40.540 --> 09:46.620]  that's it this galactic force of destruction that's animating people to
[09:46.620 --> 09:57.020]  do this the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[09:57.020 --> 10:01.740]  ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday
[10:01.740 --> 10:09.820]  the 18th day of February 2015 Obama is set today and tomorrow to host a summit
[10:09.820 --> 10:15.660]  not into Islamic terrorist or Islamic extremist but into quote extremist in
[10:15.660 --> 10:19.380]  general and why they need cybersecurity more police state there's
[10:19.380 --> 10:23.020]  bipartisan support for that up at the top of the kleptocrats to protect us
[10:23.020 --> 10:26.700]  from extremist of all types so we're gonna hear about right-wing and
[10:26.700 --> 10:31.460]  libertarian and Christian and gun owner and anti-UN and anti-fellow reserve
[10:31.460 --> 10:34.820]  terrorist all day long Homeland Security openly says and the Justice
[10:34.820 --> 10:39.620]  Department openly says with our Attorney General who said six months ago he
[10:39.620 --> 10:44.820]  would leave and never did still carrying out all sorts of dirty tricks
[10:44.820 --> 10:50.580]  against the American people they say that the main threat is domestic Patriot
[10:50.580 --> 10:55.860]  groups we have more attacks in Europe on free speech more people shot and
[10:55.860 --> 11:01.220]  killed in just the last several days in Copenhagen Denmark and then we have
[11:01.220 --> 11:06.380]  these clips from today and the last two days Barbara Lee Democrat from
[11:06.380 --> 11:12.780]  California has come out on the news and made an incredibly over-the-top statement
[11:12.780 --> 11:18.340]  agreeing with Obama statement of last night that they will not be calling the
[11:18.340 --> 11:27.100]  Islamist radicals extremist even and then we have other clips from the State
[11:27.100 --> 11:32.340]  Department and Mary Harf coming out saying that they just want jobs so I
[11:32.340 --> 11:35.900]  guess if I was out of work or you were out of work you just go kidnap 20 people
[11:35.900 --> 11:40.420]  burn him to death and then you know you just want a job kind of like the
[11:40.420 --> 11:47.260]  illegal aliens the ICE officers have leaked to memos are allowed to drunk
[11:47.260 --> 11:52.980]  drive and allowed to commit aggravated assault they're told release them above
[11:52.980 --> 11:57.860]  the law so anybody allied with this government and believe me ISIS is is
[11:57.860 --> 12:02.020]  al-Qaeda out of Syria and Iraq renamed to confuse the public because the
[12:02.020 --> 12:05.540]  military got so upset we were arming them they're not really attacking ISIS
[12:05.540 --> 12:09.140]  right now they're only attacking a few ragtag Islamic groups that have come to
[12:09.140 --> 12:14.980]  the area trying to power grab and they are organizing an attack force out of
[12:14.980 --> 12:19.780]  the new rebel army they're going to forge after they get them in line to then
[12:19.780 --> 12:23.900]  invade Syria and our own Pentagon has been saying they've been given those
[12:23.900 --> 12:27.780]  orders and here's Mikhail Phelan's article from last night that went
[12:27.780 --> 12:33.660]  super viral it should be reposted at the top of info wars calm Obama to give G
[12:33.660 --> 12:38.740]  hottest the ability to order airstrikes did you hear that quote rebels who
[12:38.740 --> 12:45.620]  pledged allegiance to ISIS to control American bombers in Syria and the cover
[12:45.620 --> 12:49.860]  is oh we're battling them but the Iraqi president came out a month ago and said
[12:49.860 --> 12:54.980]  you're they're air dropping every day to al-Qaeda to ISIS this is al-Qaeda Saudi
[12:54.980 --> 13:00.140]  Arabia runs it your government is double crossing us the Iraqi parliament has
[13:00.140 --> 13:04.100]  come out and said that our military two years ago said that this is all a bait
[13:04.100 --> 13:09.660]  and switch the Obama administration is preparing to equip the so-called moderate
[13:09.660 --> 13:13.540]  Syrian rebels let's get Colonel Schaefer on immediately we can with the ability
[13:13.540 --> 13:17.260]  to order US airstrikes despite the group's admitted allegiance to Islamic
[13:17.260 --> 13:22.660]  States this is an excuse to stick US forces and other Arab country forces in
[13:22.660 --> 13:28.860]  the area to then pipeline the smoke screen the weapons to the al-Qaeda army
[13:28.860 --> 13:32.620]  that is not following orders right now but that will after they've been bombed
[13:32.620 --> 13:36.980]  into submission then they'll forge the new Syrian free army and launch it into
[13:36.980 --> 13:43.540]  Syria watch it happen I predict within a month they'll start airstrikes in Syria
[13:43.540 --> 13:47.740]  claiming Assad wasn't helping and that'll and then they'll just say Assad is
[13:47.740 --> 13:51.500]  ISIS or something that's how dumb the public is and within three months I
[13:51.500 --> 13:56.580]  predict they'll be open airstrikes if this continues on Damascus claiming that
[13:56.580 --> 14:00.820]  we're driving out ISIS in areas that they're holding inside Syria as a base
[14:00.820 --> 14:05.580]  we've got to take out Assad because he's destabilized the country and that's
[14:05.580 --> 14:09.380]  given ISIS an area to get a foothold so we had to go in to route them out so
[14:09.380 --> 14:12.420]  this didn't happen again or they'll just keep coming across the border into Syria
[14:12.420 --> 14:19.820]  out of Syria into Jordan and into Iraq word forward you're going to hear that
[14:19.820 --> 14:23.860]  and they don't care that I know their battle plan they'll just still spew it
[14:23.860 --> 14:27.540]  in front of everybody now guys please mark what I just said so it's easy to
[14:27.540 --> 14:33.580]  find this time okay just I predict it's not hard to predict I've been
[14:33.580 --> 14:37.860]  predicting it's now happening and by the way in
[14:37.860 --> 14:43.620]  mckels article he links to mainstream news stories in fact mckel does a great
[14:43.620 --> 14:48.100]  job I just want to get him at the bottom like like some of the other riders do to
[14:48.100 --> 14:51.060]  go ahead and add the links as well and where it came from not just the hyper
[14:51.060 --> 14:54.100]  links because it gets hard for me I know I was reading it this morning and saw
[14:54.100 --> 14:58.940]  the sources but it's hard for me this is in the wall street journal but it's hard
[14:58.940 --> 15:03.740]  for me to source it when it doesn't have it at the bottom and if you're in a hurry
[15:03.740 --> 15:06.660]  and don't do it sometimes that's fine I know the links are there but it's just
[15:06.660 --> 15:10.260]  once it's flattened I want them I have to then reread the article to give you
[15:10.260 --> 15:20.660]  the sources yeah wall street journal wall street journal and and what is this
[15:20.660 --> 15:26.980]  fox news okay the point here is that this is over the top how stupid I think
[15:26.980 --> 15:31.260]  we are now let's go ahead and just go to some of these clips because remember
[15:31.260 --> 15:38.140]  Obama says he will not call the Islamist terrorist crazy people I mean if
[15:38.140 --> 15:41.340]  you had some sect of Christians taking over half the Middle East and cutting
[15:41.340 --> 15:44.500]  all the Muslims heads off they'd call them radical Christians but they won't
[15:44.500 --> 15:48.500]  even call them radical or extremist Muslims this is the political correctness
[15:48.500 --> 15:53.620]  just like hundreds of Muslim men in one city in England on record rate more
[15:53.620 --> 15:57.700]  than 4,000 children and the local police will do nothing because it's
[15:57.700 --> 16:03.100]  politically incorrect to fight organized crime when it's racially or
[16:03.100 --> 16:09.860]  religiously organized it's like if you expose the Jewish mafia of course
[16:09.860 --> 16:12.780]  there's different Jewish mafia's out there like there's Italian like there's
[16:12.780 --> 16:16.860]  Irish there's wasp mob it's so established you just don't call it the
[16:16.860 --> 16:23.980]  mafia you call it the establishment you call it boss hog if you go after the
[16:23.980 --> 16:28.700]  Jewish mafia you call anti-Semitic I mean I just expose all these mafias I
[16:28.700 --> 16:34.860]  just tell the truth look up the ADL it was founded when Jewish gangsters were
[16:34.860 --> 16:39.220]  getting in trouble and so they financed it to call people anti-Semitic if they
[16:39.220 --> 16:42.900]  dare to go after Jewish organized crime I mean that's where this stuff comes from
[16:42.900 --> 16:48.060]  we have to be able to criticize gangs whether it's a white supremacist gang
[16:48.060 --> 16:52.380]  or a Jewish gang or a Muslim gang or a black gang I mean look at all the black
[16:52.380 --> 16:58.300]  gangs out there getting stirred up by George Soros to attack the police you
[16:58.300 --> 17:01.020]  got the little white kids out there leading them from the colleges going
[17:01.020 --> 17:04.340]  time to kill the police and the police are ordered to sit there and stand down
[17:04.340 --> 17:07.740]  when terrorist threats are being made that if you or I made those threats we
[17:07.740 --> 17:13.860]  be put in jail and should be you just randomly say let's kill cops this is
[17:13.860 --> 17:16.980]  what this country's turned into let's start going to the clips here is the
[17:16.980 --> 17:21.460]  congresswoman from La La Land from California Barbara Lee agreeing with
[17:21.460 --> 17:26.660]  Obama the president and the White House they're exactly correct on this and I
[17:26.660 --> 17:31.820]  applaud them for this because first of all they're responsible for ensuring our
[17:31.820 --> 17:37.180]  national security we have to be very careful in our language and and how we
[17:37.180 --> 17:43.500]  perceive these horrible horrific acts of terrorism and we do not I believe want
[17:43.500 --> 17:49.700]  to see any more anger and hostility and and violence in the world and so they
[17:49.700 --> 17:55.100]  have to be very careful to ensure that our response so if you call people
[17:55.100 --> 17:58.300]  chopping men women and children's heads off blowing up every Christian church
[17:58.300 --> 18:03.540]  they find and killing Shiites and non-radical Alawites it will make them
[18:03.540 --> 18:09.180]  angry but Democrats get up on MSNBC and say that I'm a terrorist I'm a racist I
[18:09.180 --> 18:14.900]  hate women and that's okay and then they just make it up I mean these people are
[18:14.900 --> 18:19.020]  sick and it's because our government at the highest level is working with Al
[18:19.020 --> 18:23.980]  Qaeda let's go to Mary Harf from the State Department saying all they want
[18:23.980 --> 18:27.700]  jobs you know when they're putting little girls into sex slavery and selling
[18:27.700 --> 18:31.460]  them into slavery all they want jobs I mean listen some of them have gotten
[18:31.460 --> 18:35.060]  brown skin and their foreigners that means they're perfect the only thing
[18:35.060 --> 18:38.820]  bad in this world and we know that is a white male let's go to the clip or we
[18:38.820 --> 18:43.180]  need in the longer term medium and longer term to go after the root causes
[18:43.180 --> 18:46.940]  that leads people to join these groups whether it's lack of opportunity for
[18:46.940 --> 18:50.220]  jobs we're gonna be able to stop that in our lifetime or 50 lifetimes there's
[18:50.220 --> 18:53.660]  always gonna be poor people there's always gonna be poor Muslims and as
[18:53.660 --> 18:56.900]  long as they're poor Muslims the trumpets blowing they'll join we can't
[18:56.900 --> 19:00.180]  stop that can we we can work with countries around the world to help
[19:00.180 --> 19:03.300]  improve their governance by the way let's just stop right there we're gonna
[19:03.300 --> 19:05.540]  go to bring come back with more of these clips we got Obama basically saying the
[19:05.540 --> 19:10.540]  same thing ladies and gentlemen the West the criminal groups they're trying to
[19:10.540 --> 19:13.020]  deindustrialize us trying to make us dependent because they know if you're
[19:13.020 --> 19:17.540]  independently middle-class or well-off you politically will promote freedom
[19:17.540 --> 19:23.580]  generally and that gets in the globalist way of world government the West
[19:23.580 --> 19:28.180]  whether it's in Egypt or Libya or Syria or Iraq has been fomenting sectarian
[19:28.180 --> 19:33.100]  violence and destabilization on record general Wesley Clark has gone public in
[19:33.100 --> 19:37.100]  two different speeches saying he saw the classified battle plan to bring down
[19:37.100 --> 19:41.780]  seven countries with destabilization I don't even like Wesley Clark he's an
[19:41.780 --> 19:47.180]  anti-gun guy but at least he told the truth so we know the battle plan they
[19:47.180 --> 19:51.780]  are destabilizing it and and stirring it all up and then opening the borders up
[19:51.780 --> 19:55.660]  to bring these people in to have the clash of civilizations then they build a

[24:55.780 --> 25:00.460]  years on air we should come in with renegades also that Krista Berg song is
[25:00.460 --> 25:04.540]  very powerful as well when talks about liberty okay so the new story just went
[25:04.540 --> 25:11.420]  up minutes ago on info wars dot-com I want a red link this story by Paul Joseph
[25:11.420 --> 25:16.540]  Watson that I co-wrote with him this morning before I came into work why Obama
[25:16.540 --> 25:20.900]  refuses to call it Islamic terrorism federal government has ignored Islamic
[25:20.900 --> 25:25.420]  threat while obsessing about the domestic extremism for years by Paul Joseph
[25:25.420 --> 25:31.460]  Watson and Alex Jones and we go through the fact that they use the radical
[25:31.460 --> 25:36.540]  Islamist threat that they've opened the door to that they ship in as the pretext
[25:36.540 --> 25:40.740]  to then set up the police state or domestically now here's Obama six months
[25:40.740 --> 25:48.620]  ago saying ISIS or ISIL is not Islamic and bananas aren't yellow and the sky
[25:48.620 --> 25:53.460]  in blue and well if you believe that if you believe that ISIS isn't it radical
[25:53.460 --> 25:58.180]  Islamists right out of Saudi Arabia I got oceanfront property in Arizona and
[25:58.180 --> 26:01.780]  from my front porch you can see the sea and if you'll buy that I'll throw the
[26:01.780 --> 26:05.740]  golden gate in free now let's make two things clear
[26:05.740 --> 26:11.980]  ISIL is not Islamic no religion condones the killing of innocents and the vast
[26:11.980 --> 26:17.140]  majority of ISIL's victims have been Muslim and ISIL is certainly not a
[26:17.140 --> 26:21.980]  state it was formerly al-Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq and has taken advantage
[26:21.980 --> 26:28.380]  of sectarian strife and Syria civil war to gain territory on both sides of the
[26:28.380 --> 26:33.020]  Iraq-Syrian border that's enough is reckoned our government with NATO four
[26:33.020 --> 26:36.940]  and a half years ago began funding al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia Qatar and
[26:36.940 --> 26:44.100]  Yemen this is all on record Congress has had hearings to launch attacks against
[26:44.100 --> 26:46.980]  the country that was trying to work with Israel in the US and had done nothing
[26:46.980 --> 26:51.540]  and it opened up diplomatic channels just like Gaddafi did I mean they set
[26:51.540 --> 26:58.260]  these people up and Gaddafi was no angel but compared to al-Qaeda he was and
[26:58.260 --> 27:05.140]  then Assad was better than Gaddafi with his record this is very immoral what
[27:05.140 --> 27:08.980]  our government's done now here's the new clip with Obama saying that they're
[27:08.980 --> 27:15.660]  not extremist it's very important for us to align ourselves with the 99.9% of
[27:15.660 --> 27:20.940]  Muslims who are looking for the same thing we're looking for order peace
[27:20.940 --> 27:31.380]  prosperity and so you know I don't quibble with labels but Texas Republican
[27:31.380 --> 27:34.940]  senator Ted Cruz complains the name of the summit doesn't even mention the
[27:34.940 --> 27:42.860]  word Islam the words radical Islamic terrorism do not come out of the
[27:42.860 --> 27:51.140]  president's mouth the word jihad does not come out of the president's mouth and
[27:51.140 --> 27:55.260]  that is dangerous attorney general Eric Holder says critics are missing the
[27:55.260 --> 28:00.260]  point oh my gosh conversation about words as opposed to what our actions
[28:00.260 --> 28:08.060]  ought to be this is a difficult problem hey why are you still up there and why
[28:08.060 --> 28:11.380]  do you have people following me around in Austin Holder because I know that's
[28:11.380 --> 28:16.860]  from the Justice Department confirmed you got ice release any legal aliens
[28:16.860 --> 28:21.900]  that are drunk or committed felonies but you got time to harass me and Dinesh
[28:21.900 --> 28:26.740]  the Sousa and you said six seven months ago look up when he announced he was
[28:26.740 --> 28:30.700]  leaving and he said within a month he's a liar everything they do is a
[28:30.700 --> 28:36.740]  deception I mean this country is on the edge of a criminal takeover this
[28:36.740 --> 28:41.700]  attorney general shipped tens of thousands of guns under orders to then
[28:41.700 --> 28:46.060]  blame gun shops later he tried to set up to Mexico so they could trace them have
[28:46.060 --> 28:50.660]  a bunch of deaths caused by it turns out that the cartels are buying mainly
[28:50.660 --> 28:54.580]  German weapons the cartels are very anti-america down there the Mexico's
[28:54.580 --> 28:59.300]  lost three wars of the US almost all and I've had top professors on almost all
[28:59.300 --> 29:04.620]  the cartels weapons are German because Germany built the infrastructure what
[29:04.620 --> 29:10.580]  was the Austrian Hungarian Empire they had Maximilian they had a German King it's
[29:10.580 --> 29:15.340]  just amazing head-knowing history and almost all of them are fully auto from
[29:15.340 --> 29:21.180]  Germany full auto from Germany so he did that to have some guns but turned up the
[29:21.180 --> 29:26.060]  Mexican farmers got the US guns and are using it to maintain order in some of
[29:26.060 --> 29:29.580]  their areas and they're beating the cartels with full auto with their single
[29:29.580 --> 29:33.940]  shot and bolt action and semi-auto but that's a side issue what is this guy
[29:33.940 --> 29:40.100]  doing lecturing us look almost all of the government's time is spent on
[29:40.100 --> 29:44.180]  domestic groups libertarians conservatives patriots gun groups okay
[29:44.180 --> 29:48.020]  that's who they admit they spend their main focus on okay period though they're
[29:48.020 --> 29:53.940]  gonna use this as a power grab March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[32:19.340 --> 32:23.660]  the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market
[32:23.660 --> 32:28.140]  sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of
[32:28.140 --> 32:31.740]  bioactive ingredients extracted directly from the wild
[32:31.740 --> 32:35.020]  herb and sealed in easy to use capsules you will no
[32:35.020 --> 32:38.540]  longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue
[32:38.540 --> 32:42.300]  wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is
[32:42.300 --> 32:45.100]  one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire
[32:45.100 --> 32:49.180]  this winter season it's more important than ever to secure this true form
[32:49.180 --> 32:52.380]  of oil of oregano now available in our limited first run
[32:52.380 --> 32:55.980]  at info wars life dot com that's info wars life dot com are called
[32:55.980 --> 33:04.460]  888-253-3139
[33:04.460 --> 33:11.980]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the
[33:11.980 --> 33:15.260]  alex jones show
[33:19.340 --> 33:24.060]  that's right you're listening to alex jones show i'm alex jones your host
[33:25.900 --> 33:31.660]  there's so much to get to not just this first group of stories that i've been
[33:31.660 --> 33:35.500]  breaking down and covering here today
[33:35.500 --> 33:39.020]  here's the wall street journal headline us to give some
[33:39.020 --> 33:44.060]  syrian rebels ability to call airstrikes after training moderate rebels to
[33:44.060 --> 33:50.060]  get pickups with gear to call for american b1b bombers
[33:50.060 --> 33:52.860]  and of course they trained the first group of moderates and the second group of
[33:52.860 --> 33:56.780]  moderates and scores of groups to be sent in
[33:56.780 --> 34:02.060]  who just promptly join al qaeda and isis and i've had colonel shaffer and others
[34:02.060 --> 34:05.980]  on the break that down i see a comment on info wars dot com
[34:05.980 --> 34:10.300]  in the article while obama refuses to call it islamic terrorism
[34:10.300 --> 34:18.220]  and jack says islamic threat i thought isis was a cia run unit
[34:18.220 --> 34:23.500]  and fake that's not exactly what we said in order to take our rights according
[34:23.500 --> 34:26.780]  to alex jones so by alex jones own admission
[34:26.780 --> 34:30.700]  he should be praising obama for resisting the new world order
[34:30.700 --> 34:36.060]  created war this is a dialectic to confuse the weak-minded i'm going to
[34:36.060 --> 34:42.140]  try to explain this to jack very slowly and very sweetly
[34:42.140 --> 34:46.540]  when they use the radical islamists this was saudi arabian funding in 1979
[34:46.540 --> 34:51.660]  under the big brzezinski's plan to launch wars not just in afghanistan
[34:51.660 --> 34:57.020]  but areas bordering afghanistan to the north and to the west
[34:57.020 --> 35:02.140]  forcing the russians to come in to respond
[35:02.940 --> 35:08.060]  that was a trap so they didn't totally control the jihadis
[35:08.060 --> 35:11.420]  they were funding them they were arming them and then later
[35:11.420 --> 35:15.260]  they were supposedly blowback on 9 11 but the door was opened
[35:15.260 --> 35:18.860]  and saudi arabia was there running the operation
[35:18.860 --> 35:22.540]  the 28 pages senator graham of the 9 11 commission
[35:22.540 --> 35:26.380]  has gone public and i've talked to walter jones a congressman
[35:26.380 --> 35:29.420]  he's gone public and colonel shaffer and everybody else okay
[35:29.420 --> 35:34.700]  so i was right again period so i'm going to explain this to you
[35:34.700 --> 35:39.100]  it isn't just black or white where it's either a hundred percent run or is a
[35:39.100 --> 35:43.660]  hundred percent run four and a half years ago a program
[35:43.660 --> 35:49.020]  was launched in libya in syria and egypt and a bunch of other places to
[35:49.020 --> 35:51.820]  overthrow the governments and put radicals in
[35:51.820 --> 35:55.900]  obama and other soros connected groups even above the cia
[35:55.900 --> 36:00.860]  they do this even outside government this stuff's so criminal
[36:00.860 --> 36:07.420]  went in and with google analytics and with facebook behind it they all met
[36:07.420 --> 36:09.740]  the same place bill de berg met a few years ago they met there a few years
[36:09.740 --> 36:12.460]  before that uh they're north of london this is all
[36:12.460 --> 36:16.380]  been publicly released and funded the air of spring where they get the students
[36:16.380 --> 36:20.060]  everybody out the street but then the radicals use that once they take over
[36:20.060 --> 36:23.740]  to coup d'etat the coup and then now you have an islamic state
[36:23.740 --> 36:27.020]  over libya over saudi arabia which is already
[36:27.020 --> 36:33.580]  quarter backing it over syria over egypt
[36:33.580 --> 36:37.740]  so there's wezzley clark we have it on screen libya and syria the neocon plan to
[36:37.740 --> 36:40.300]  attack seven countries in five years using
[36:40.300 --> 36:44.300]  destabilization once you destabilize you then have an excuse to come in
[36:44.300 --> 36:48.460]  and bomb the very groups you turned loose to begin with
[36:48.460 --> 36:53.340]  so obama is acting like he's a moderate and that
[36:53.340 --> 36:57.500]  he's only fighting you know some of the radicals because you know he loves islam
[36:57.500 --> 37:01.340]  so much the truth is they're doing limited
[37:01.340 --> 37:04.540]  airstrikes on different disparate rebel groups
[37:04.540 --> 37:08.940]  that are in their battling for control of syria that the west open the door for
[37:08.940 --> 37:14.060]  to get them buggy whipped in the line
[37:14.060 --> 37:18.700]  so that then they can be forged into a new army
[37:18.700 --> 37:23.820]  to go in and take out syria and the excuse will be
[37:23.820 --> 37:28.140]  because the syrian civil war that gave isis a home base that gave al qaeda a
[37:28.140 --> 37:31.500]  home base and so now we've got to go in and clean out the whole
[37:31.500 --> 37:34.060]  country it's a sod's fault we've already heard this
[37:34.060 --> 37:37.500]  you're going to hear it again that's why they're saying oh
[37:37.500 --> 37:41.740]  we're there with rebels now calling in airstrikes and giving them weapons with
[37:41.740 --> 37:45.820]  billions of dollars of funding that congress has passed in three different
[37:45.820 --> 37:49.260]  spending packages the last four or five months
[37:49.260 --> 37:52.140]  billions of dollars and it's in the wall street journal that
[37:52.140 --> 37:55.900]  well the good rebels are being given vehicles and they're allowed to launch
[37:55.900 --> 37:58.380]  attacks and then you'll see these very vehicles in a month
[37:58.380 --> 38:03.020]  flying isis flags and no one will go wait a minute we gave them that or or they
[38:03.020 --> 38:08.060]  might say oh yeah isis captured it just like
[38:08.060 --> 38:11.820]  they captured iraqi bases full of artillery and new weapons
[38:11.820 --> 38:18.140]  and rpgs like the marines of the army just left those weapons caches in bases
[38:18.140 --> 38:21.180]  and didn't defend them or didn't have self-destruct bombs
[38:21.180 --> 38:26.220]  didn't have detonators already placed to blow up ammo dumps
[38:26.220 --> 38:30.940]  they let them have it and all they need is the plausible deniability
[38:30.940 --> 38:35.180]  just like Benghazi and the heat seeking missiles the anti-aircraft surface to
[38:35.180 --> 38:38.860]  air missiles so i've been here since Benghazi happened
[38:38.860 --> 38:42.140]  and before telling you exactly what will unfold and now it is
[38:42.140 --> 38:48.140]  and your response is islamic threat close quote i thought isis was a cia run unit
[38:48.140 --> 38:54.700]  and fake in order to take our rights yes they're now having a radical
[38:54.700 --> 38:58.060]  you know extremism meeting and most of it they're now saying is going to be
[38:58.060 --> 39:02.140]  about gun owners and and and right-wingers and veterans and tim mcvay
[39:02.140 --> 39:05.500]  types see you're seeing and i told you year after
[39:05.500 --> 39:09.420]  year they're gonna let the islamics radical threat take place then they're
[39:09.420 --> 39:12.620]  going to target domestic groups and you're seeing that yet again
[39:12.620 --> 39:16.220]  with a two-day summit that's about to begin and you're going to hear all about
[39:16.220 --> 39:20.940]  domestic groups guaranteed so they're going to use the
[39:20.940 --> 39:24.540]  shootings and the bombings and all the rest of it happening in europe right now
[39:24.540 --> 39:29.340]  to then be projected on to the general public and the people resisting the
[39:29.340 --> 39:32.860]  globalist takeover the people resisting the fact that our borders are wide open
[39:32.860 --> 39:36.860]  and we're now in a north american union and having our basic freedoms dissolved
[39:36.860 --> 39:39.900]  and the government's announcement is to start coming after your private pension
[39:39.900 --> 39:45.420]  funds and your investment funds and your and your education funds
[39:45.420 --> 39:48.460]  your retirement funds
[39:48.780 --> 39:54.060]  they're putting the police stayed in for the american people and but they need
[39:54.060 --> 39:57.980]  the average cops and even the average fbi and cia
[39:57.980 --> 40:02.140]  to go along with its implementation believing it's for the radical islamist
[40:02.140 --> 40:06.220]  threat but now they're converting and shifting to the domestic threat which
[40:06.220 --> 40:09.340]  i've told you thousands of times obnoxiously they
[40:09.340 --> 40:12.780]  would and now it's happening and then when they're done they're
[40:12.780 --> 40:15.660]  going to blow up buildings this criminal international group
[40:15.660 --> 40:18.220]  they're going to shoot up schools they're going to do you name it and they're
[40:18.220 --> 40:24.540]  going to blame alex jones and talk radio in general and free speech and
[40:24.540 --> 40:28.540]  anyone that is not totally in line with foreign banks
[40:28.540 --> 40:32.780]  gutting this country and obama care and open borders
[40:32.780 --> 40:35.740]  and and your kids being taught at age five how to have sex
[40:35.740 --> 40:39.580]  and this whole agenda to take over our society and forced inoculations and the
[40:39.580 --> 40:42.940]  rest of it you know we were called racist a couple weeks ago saying
[40:42.940 --> 40:46.220]  guaranteed these new measles strains because we can read them medical reports
[40:46.220 --> 40:49.660]  getting followed by doctors are coming out of latin america and and the
[40:49.660 --> 40:53.020]  philippines other countries these are super mutated strains
[40:53.020 --> 40:59.180]  california measles identical to type found in the philippines la times
[40:59.180 --> 41:04.780]  today but their answer is we should all be forced to take the vaccines but it's
[41:04.780 --> 41:09.420]  people who've had the vaccines that are getting it
[41:09.420 --> 41:12.460]  20 new cases
[41:12.460 --> 41:17.420]  oh my gosh no one's died it's the end of the world run for the hills so let me
[41:17.420 --> 41:19.020]  go through these headlines for you
[41:19.020 --> 41:22.460]  us to give some syrian rebels ability to call airstrikes told you that would
[41:22.460 --> 41:24.700]  happen
[41:25.980 --> 41:29.340]  stories up on info wars dot com because that's the wall street journal but
[41:29.340 --> 41:32.700]  mckelton's story adding more background more depth to it
[41:32.700 --> 41:39.020]  why obama refuses to call it islamic terrorism info wars dot com
[41:39.020 --> 41:42.700]  exclusive u.s. may have let dozens of terrorists into the country
[41:42.700 --> 41:47.580]  as refugees oh my goodness several dozen suspected terrorist bomb makers
[41:47.580 --> 41:50.780]  including some believe to have targeted american troops
[41:50.780 --> 41:54.300]  may have mistakenly been allowed yeah right to move the united states
[41:54.300 --> 41:57.340]  as war refugees according to fb agents investigating the remnants
[41:57.340 --> 42:02.140]  of roadside bombs recovered from iraq and afghanistan
[42:02.140 --> 42:06.700]  and just like before 9 11 fbi agents try to stop them training at the air bases
[42:06.700 --> 42:09.580]  and training at the flight schools and were told
[42:09.580 --> 42:12.620]  they would be shut down and that they would be basically fired or indicted
[42:12.620 --> 42:16.860]  if they continued and then john o'neill the head of anti-terrorism
[42:16.860 --> 42:20.700]  basically was forced to resign his first day at work with september 11th and he
[42:20.700 --> 42:23.580]  supposedly died in the building you can't make that up
[42:23.580 --> 42:26.140]  he gave a speech in england two months before he died
[42:26.140 --> 42:29.420]  saying our government you can pull this up our government
[42:29.420 --> 42:32.300]  is going to allow all kind of do attack us to take american liberties
[42:32.300 --> 42:36.300]  that's a john o'neill quote you can actually see blow-ups of it quoted
[42:36.300 --> 42:40.860]  from whichever british newspaper it was and the new yorker magazine reported on
[42:40.860 --> 42:45.740]  it in my film road to tyranny my memory can't pull up the exact
[42:45.740 --> 42:49.580]  dates and but i just gave you his quotes
[42:49.580 --> 42:52.460]  and again you've got criminals a very small group at the top that need to
[42:52.460 --> 42:56.380]  manipulate the state police manipulate the local police manipulate the fbi
[42:56.380 --> 43:01.260]  manipulate the public manipulate the military where it's all confusing
[43:01.260 --> 43:05.020]  i said six eight months ago yeah i i i agree when ran paul says yeah we should
[43:05.020 --> 43:08.060]  probably bomb isis but why did our government help them get a
[43:08.060 --> 43:12.380]  flood hold in syria see they know the public
[43:12.380 --> 43:15.180]  can't get that sophisticated anymore because they haven't been taught how
[43:15.180 --> 43:18.780]  things work or how to look at things from a sophisticated
[43:18.780 --> 43:23.260]  perspective up above it not emotionally from one side of the other
[43:23.260 --> 43:26.700]  kind of like uh robert kiyosaki was saying yesterday there's three sides
[43:26.700 --> 43:30.540]  of every coin heads tails and the edge
[43:30.540 --> 43:34.220]  there's a headline the counter terrorists john o'neill was an fbi agent
[43:34.220 --> 43:38.300]  with an obsession the growing threat of al-qaeda
[43:38.300 --> 43:42.380]  that was in uh 2002 january 14th and then we can probably find the british
[43:42.380 --> 43:44.780]  one with the quote he really had the hardcore quote
[43:44.780 --> 43:47.820]  where he gave a speech saying the government is going to let al-qaeda
[43:47.820 --> 43:52.300]  hit us and remember seeing articles in the bbc like fbi agents say it's as if
[43:52.300 --> 43:57.980]  al-qaeda has moles above them at the fbi well it's more than that the globalist
[43:57.980 --> 44:01.900]  have moles in all these institutions
[44:01.900 --> 44:04.620]  and
[44:04.780 --> 44:09.100]  why is insider trading allowed by congress why is insider trading
[44:09.100 --> 44:13.340]  because the justice department is totally compromised
[44:13.340 --> 44:16.700]  and they'll only go after somebody for a crooked toenail
[44:16.700 --> 44:19.980]  or if some patriot bounces a check they'll call it money laundering and
[44:19.980 --> 44:24.860]  throw you in jail with their cooked up kangaroo juries
[44:24.860 --> 44:28.860]  and everybody better worry because they're getting ready to gut this country
[44:28.860 --> 44:32.140]  i mean the corruption has built to a level that is mind
[44:32.140 --> 44:37.180]  boggling the irs targeting more than 50 000 conservatives and libertarians
[44:37.180 --> 44:41.100]  and christians and pro-life groups
[44:41.420 --> 44:44.460]  under justice department orders i mean they're one step away from trying to
[44:44.460 --> 44:46.940]  round everybody up and believe me if there wasn't a second amendment in
[44:46.940 --> 44:50.940]  place they'd do it but the good news is they've
[44:50.940 --> 44:53.740]  got a seven to eight percent approval rating in congress
[44:53.740 --> 44:56.860]  people know what's going on they're aware of the corruption of the american
[44:56.860 --> 44:59.900]  people are not buying it and now it's giving cover
[44:59.900 --> 45:04.780]  to good people in the nsa in the cia in the fbi
[45:04.780 --> 45:08.540]  whereas corrupt as those agencies are those are some of the most awake people
[45:08.540 --> 45:12.140]  you'll ever talk to because they're living it
[45:12.140 --> 45:14.860]  i was talking to a
[45:15.740 --> 45:19.500]  high-level state judge i'll just leave it at that and he said no i would you
[45:19.500 --> 45:22.140]  know basically hear the stuff you talk about years ago and think it was crazy
[45:22.140 --> 45:25.900]  but look at the irs stuff look at us funding al-qaeda and syria
[45:25.900 --> 45:30.940]  it's true it's crazy look at warrantless blood draws
[45:30.940 --> 45:34.380]  on the side of the highway look at illegals
[45:34.380 --> 45:38.620]  allowed to commit felonies and being released i mean
[45:38.620 --> 45:42.700]  does anyone think this is just going to stop here no no it's going to get worse
[45:42.700 --> 45:49.660]  and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse
[45:50.060 --> 45:53.900]  when colonel schaefer exposed the fact with stratos ivy and
[45:53.900 --> 45:56.620]  all those secret operations he didn't release any of the secret stuff but
[45:56.620 --> 45:59.020]  just the fact that they could have killed bin laden twice
[45:59.020 --> 46:02.540]  in the month before 9 11 they tried to indict him
[46:02.540 --> 46:05.820]  for like 66 66 dollars you can look it up
[46:05.820 --> 46:10.220]  of unpaid not unpaid of phone calls on his colonel's
[46:10.220 --> 46:15.900]  cell phone to his wife saying it was theft to call his wife on his cell
[46:15.900 --> 46:20.300]  phone even though in the guidelines it says of course you can call your spouse
[46:20.300 --> 46:26.860]  hey i'm not coming home i'm i gotta go here there or help me get my bags packed
[46:26.860 --> 46:31.260]  they began the indictment investigation
[46:31.340 --> 46:34.700]  but he didn't back down i mean so they backed off
[46:34.700 --> 46:39.500]  imagine how criminal these people are oh hey we could have killed bin laden
[46:39.500 --> 46:42.940]  twice but we were ordered to stand down oh we're gonna indict you for 66
[46:42.940 --> 46:46.220]  dollars of phone bill
[46:46.220 --> 46:50.860]  you're a thief but i read from judicial watch
[46:50.860 --> 46:53.260]  yesterday
[46:53.900 --> 46:57.900]  where it said in the ice memos you may think letting a drunk driver or other
[46:57.900 --> 47:01.260]  you know criminal go is going to let them go down the road and hurt someone
[47:01.260 --> 47:04.460]  of that that death on your hands no it is not
[47:04.460 --> 47:08.460]  they didn't cite any precedent they didn't cite any law they lied to you and
[47:08.460 --> 47:13.660]  said you can selectively enforce the law
[47:13.660 --> 47:17.980]  i mean it's bold to put that on paper they're now putting
[47:17.980 --> 47:22.300]  police uh you do you think police like
[47:22.300 --> 47:26.940]  quotas do they like watching a cop get paid 130 thousand dollars a year
[47:26.940 --> 47:30.860]  who writes five times more tickets than them
[47:30.860 --> 47:34.780]  police hate it they bought ads in the new york paper the police union
[47:34.780 --> 47:38.700]  we've got a tape we're gonna play in the next segment of the of the of the police
[47:38.700 --> 47:42.380]  commander going listen you write tickets and you arrest people you're gonna be
[47:42.380 --> 47:45.660]  fired now get out there
[47:45.660 --> 47:50.300]  but don't arrest the illegals can you imagine
[47:50.300 --> 47:53.980]  make arrest issue tickets or get fired Missouri police caught in
[47:53.980 --> 47:59.980]  discussing quota scheme and the issue is they pull over some poor
[47:59.980 --> 48:03.340]  black lady or Hispanic lady or white lady who's a citizen they got three kids
[48:03.340 --> 48:05.660]  in the back of the car the woman's got her maid equipment i was talking to
[48:05.660 --> 48:10.300]  cop out this years ago she doesn't have insurance
[48:10.300 --> 48:13.420]  and and and she says man i just can't afford it i and i'm gonna do
[48:13.420 --> 48:17.260]  go on welfare and the cop said he couldn't write her a ticket
[48:17.260 --> 48:21.180]  and then they reviewed the dash cam and basically sanctioned him
[48:21.180 --> 48:24.220]  because he just couldn't do it with the sick kid in the back was snot running
[48:24.220 --> 48:27.100]  down her face and two other kids and the woman's a maid
[48:27.100 --> 48:30.140]  like totally exhausted she just says i don't have any money
[48:30.140 --> 48:34.460]  i can't pay it and that cop knew full well he can't give any legal alien a
[48:34.460 --> 48:37.900]  ticket for that or if they do he gets in trouble but he's got to give it to that
[48:37.900 --> 48:44.300]  American citizen that is sickening discrimination ladies and gentlemen
[48:44.300 --> 48:48.540]  excuse me i'm digressing but but is there something wrong with me
[48:48.540 --> 48:52.620]  because the military got it two years ago that we were the air force of al-qaeda
[48:52.620 --> 48:55.980]  in syria and so they wouldn't be part of it and it stopped
[48:55.980 --> 49:00.300]  so they rebranded it had it invade iraq to get a bunch of u.s bases weapons
[49:00.300 --> 49:03.180]  caches to turn back around and go back in and
[49:03.180 --> 49:06.860]  go back into syria and now we've got to take over syria to get rid of al-qaeda
[49:06.860 --> 49:11.180]  isis's foothold i mean that's so simple

[54:44.620 --> 54:48.540]  we seceded from england because they were making decisions in england and
[54:48.540 --> 54:52.060]  ignoring our legislatures but at least the decisions made in the
[54:52.060 --> 54:55.820]  parliament of england were public
[54:55.900 --> 55:01.020]  these are secret i mean it's over the top how much tyranny there is but so much
[55:01.020 --> 55:05.420]  liberty was there that there's two systems running side by side
[55:05.420 --> 55:09.580]  so it hadn't been as bad because where there is tyranny it's sporadic
[55:09.580 --> 55:13.420]  but now it's phasing out the liberty there were two trains running side by
[55:13.420 --> 55:17.500]  side now they're phasing it out uh coming up

[55:48.140 --> 55:52.780]  make arrest issue tickets or get fired missouri police caught discussing quota
[55:52.780 --> 55:58.380]  scheme st louis missouri a former belfonte neighbors
[55:58.380 --> 56:00.860]  police officer has come out of the quota
[56:00.860 --> 56:03.580]  closet and is exposing the department's highly unethical
[56:03.580 --> 56:08.140]  revenue collection scheme ten-year veteran of the forest officer joe
[56:08.140 --> 56:11.660]  st claire was ordered to carry out a policy that he says required cops to
[56:11.660 --> 56:15.100]  issue a certain number of traffic tickets and even traffic arrest if the
[56:15.100 --> 56:18.300]  cops fail to do it they could be fired well the big thing is the average
[56:18.300 --> 56:22.780]  cop is paid about 50 grand in austin some of the dwi cops who paid 130
[56:22.780 --> 56:25.900]  thousand they're like well let's stop dwi they
[56:25.900 --> 56:30.060]  they take it as yell for one beer but let illegals run into whoever they want
[56:30.060 --> 56:32.620]  and the police chief's like well we don't want to scare the illegals so they
[56:32.620 --> 56:36.620]  don't come to us i'm gonna be a break it's an order from the feds
[56:36.620 --> 56:40.300]  i believe the chief putting legal mandate on his officers i think it's
[56:40.300 --> 56:43.980]  unfair to the community and we've got a tape of this
[56:43.980 --> 56:47.340]  you can go read the whole article but here's a type of being discussed
[56:47.340 --> 56:51.100]  approaching the van of belfonte neighbors mayor robert door
[56:51.100 --> 56:53.660]  mayor we just want to ask you nothing on camera
[56:53.660 --> 56:58.540]  mayor we want to ask you some questions but the mayor refused to talk on camera
[56:58.540 --> 57:02.700]  about a police policy the critics say is indefensible
[57:02.700 --> 57:08.540]  i think it's unfair to the community as a belfonte neighbors cop for a decade
[57:08.540 --> 57:11.820]  joe st claire was ordered to carry out that policy
[57:11.820 --> 57:15.260]  it was a mandate put in writing that st claire says
[57:15.260 --> 57:19.740]  required cops to issue a certain number of traffic tickets and even traffic
[57:19.740 --> 57:24.060]  arrests if they fail to do it they could be fired i think it's
[57:24.060 --> 57:29.660]  sad i think it's really sad st claire gave us copies of spreadsheets used by
[57:29.660 --> 57:32.140]  the belfonte neighbors police department
[57:32.140 --> 57:36.300]  they identify seven different self-initiated activities
[57:36.300 --> 57:41.580]  that officers are required to do those include writing ordinance violations
[57:41.580 --> 57:45.980]  traffic arrests uniform traffic tickets parking violations
[57:45.980 --> 57:49.820]  and traffic warnings st claire had to do 50 of them
[57:49.820 --> 57:54.540]  every month the spreadsheet show that traffic arrests represented up to 15
[57:54.540 --> 57:57.740]  percent of the required activities for belfonte
[57:57.740 --> 58:01.900]  neighbors cops an equivalent of up to eight arrests per month
[58:01.900 --> 58:06.060]  and that uniform traffic tickets were up to 60 percent or about
[58:06.060 --> 58:10.140]  30 tickets per month did you and other officers feel like
[58:10.140 --> 58:14.540]  your pay was at risk if you didn't write enough tickets
[58:14.540 --> 58:18.060]  of course um progressive discipline eventually to
[58:18.060 --> 58:21.660]  suspension demotion and even termination if you didn't write enough tickets

[1:00:50.940 --> 1:00:56.700]  on duty former police officers if we're such a free society they should call in

[1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:31.340]  at the state level it's come out for quotas
[1:01:31.340 --> 1:01:36.460]  on people being convicted for prison they've caught
[1:01:36.460 --> 1:01:40.700]  judges and they've gone to jail in fact print that judge caught
[1:01:40.700 --> 1:01:45.180]  sending kids to juvenile for pay he was getting money from the private
[1:01:45.180 --> 1:01:49.820]  prison to send innocent people to jail there's big money in all of this
[1:01:49.820 --> 1:01:56.940]  member to lia texas a racist talk about a racist town
[1:01:56.940 --> 1:02:03.020]  tiny town privately on prison connected to the cops who own part of it
[1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:07.980]  and they would put old cotton farmers and people with no criminal record
[1:02:07.980 --> 1:02:11.500]  there's the headline former judge sentenced to prison for kids for cash
[1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:16.140]  scheme that print me that thank you that's from Reuters
[1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:19.820]  just as i talk about this hundreds of articles come up in my mind
[1:02:19.820 --> 1:02:25.820]  where where it's it's modern slavery there's a bounty on heads in jail
[1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:29.180]  and so they'll put innocent people in the case of tulia texas
[1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:32.780]  something like half the black population was in jail and almost all of them
[1:02:32.780 --> 1:02:36.060]  totally innocent and they were done grabbing all the young men they had the
[1:02:36.060 --> 1:02:39.420]  young women they had the old people you know 70-something-year-old cotton
[1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:45.340]  farmers all in this phony drug war and so now this is expanding out
[1:02:45.340 --> 1:02:49.260]  from there with the asset forage for seizure and all the rest of it
[1:02:49.260 --> 1:02:53.340]  and that's where this leads rack and ruin while the government ships in the
[1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:56.860]  majority of the narcotics so i'd like to hear from police out there
[1:02:56.860 --> 1:03:00.620]  what do you do about this i get the drug culture is pretty
[1:03:00.620 --> 1:03:03.580]  scummy i get criminals are associated with it
[1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:07.340]  so i get it's bad but by making the drugs
[1:03:07.340 --> 1:03:14.540]  illegal you put the huge premium on it so you decriminalize but regulate it
[1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:18.540]  as europe has done in most areas and drug use goes down by at least
[1:03:18.540 --> 1:03:24.620]  50% you pull those statistics up your prisons then are not full of people but
[1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:28.220]  instead we have the largest prison population in the world and now they're
[1:03:28.220 --> 1:03:34.300]  incentivizing the public schools to be pipelines directly to jail
[1:03:34.300 --> 1:03:38.220]  so i'd like to hear from corrections officers i'd like to hear from police
[1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:43.900]  former or current i'd like to hear from people about this subject of the quotas
[1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:48.460]  because i love how they deny him and quota stuff is just constantly coming out
[1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:53.180]  and it's disgusting
[1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:57.180]  and it's wrong and it's wrong to pay cops
[1:03:57.180 --> 1:04:01.100]  off of how many people they write tickets to because then you just get a
[1:04:01.100 --> 1:04:04.700]  revenue generation machine and now with all the zoning laws and the rest of
[1:04:04.700 --> 1:04:10.780]  it they're just expanding police powers to the zoning police the list goes on
[1:04:10.780 --> 1:04:15.580]  and on under agenda 21 that's the program we're entering into

[1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:31.500]  some of the good rebels we're going to arm and and call an airstrikes form to
[1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:34.780]  take over syria that's the real reason us forces are moving in
[1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:38.620]  is to control some of the radical groups that they don't fully control and then
[1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:43.020]  to prepare an invasion of syria we predicted that that's now happening
[1:04:43.020 --> 1:04:49.500]  800-259-9231 and then coming up in the third hour we're going to do it again

[1:08:12.540 --> 1:08:15.180]  been pointing out for the last three plus years that
[1:08:15.180 --> 1:08:22.700]  twitter facebook yahoo google youtube which is google have been allowing
[1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:27.100]  isis formerly al-qaeda to recruit and threaten people
[1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:30.060]  i mean they leave videos up with their chopping people's heads off and it's the
[1:08:30.060 --> 1:08:32.940]  original upload they they leave videos up with their threatening to kill
[1:08:32.940 --> 1:08:37.580]  everybody and here's the headline from yahoo

[1:08:42.060 --> 1:08:46.220]  act more aggressively against terrorists as the islamic states go to
[1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:50.460]  propaganda platform the social media giant faces increasing demands
[1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:54.860]  to police its network oh yeah i mean if i criticize al gore
[1:08:54.860 --> 1:08:59.020]  they'll take my videos down uh or or links on twitter facebook yahoo they all
[1:08:59.020 --> 1:09:01.820]  do it uh google censored us won't let us sell the
[1:09:01.820 --> 1:09:05.820]  obama deception on their chopping cart saying it's racist
[1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:11.020]  but islamic state is allowed i mean these are real groups too because we
[1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:15.500]  link back to the main group and they threaten to kill me
[1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:18.380]  and that's why you hear all these gi's wives go in public
[1:09:18.380 --> 1:09:21.100]  that they find out that they've got husbands in the military and they go and
[1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:23.900]  threaten them and say stuff like will we take over
[1:09:23.900 --> 1:09:27.500]  america when i rape you and all this stuff i've got a big stack of articles
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:31.500]  about them torturing women and raping them stuff so horrible i can't even
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:34.140]  read it on air
[1:09:35.260 --> 1:09:40.220]  and obama won't even call them extremists
[1:09:40.220 --> 1:09:44.300]  terror ink how the islamic state became a branding behemoth
[1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:48.620]  yahoo news
[1:09:48.620 --> 1:09:53.500]  and it goes on with vines tweets is spreads its hateful message can the
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:57.020]  west find a way to fight back oh we need cyber security take everyone's
[1:09:57.020 --> 1:09:59.660]  rights away see they let them recruit they let them
[1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:03.660]  get every moron every mentally ill patient to go join them
[1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:07.180]  have all their lone wolves start attacking and then they have a summit
[1:10:07.180 --> 1:10:10.940]  about right wingers that's going to be talked about by obama and libertarians
[1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:16.060]  it's a it's an extremist summit to blame you know the non-existent
[1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:20.940]  conservative threat to integrate that in with al qaeda and isis
[1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:24.540]  and i played those clips last hour of obama talking about
[1:10:24.540 --> 1:10:29.420]  just that now with that said
[1:10:29.740 --> 1:10:36.300]  i covered this article last hour make arrest issue tickets or get fired
[1:10:36.380 --> 1:10:40.380]  a tv station out of missouri reports on it
[1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:45.260]  caught a disgusting quota scheme to make eight arrest a month and write 50
[1:10:45.260 --> 1:10:48.940]  tickets or get fired and then that ties in with these
[1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:51.660]  articles that come in constantly elderly man facing
[1:10:51.660 --> 1:10:58.380]  10 years for unloaded flintlock that was made in 1762
[1:10:58.460 --> 1:11:02.060]  look at this headline cbs news border patrol agent advised to release drunk
[1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:05.820]  drivers told it doesn't matter if they kill somebody
[1:11:05.820 --> 1:11:10.300]  but they should still write tickets and arrest us citizens
[1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:14.780]  see this is all selective the essence of tyranny is selective enforcement
[1:11:14.780 --> 1:11:18.780]  i'd like to hear from police former police jail guards
[1:11:18.780 --> 1:11:23.740]  i mean how do you square this this has been known to be going on forever but
[1:11:23.740 --> 1:11:27.100]  now it's out in the open that the government really is trying to target
[1:11:27.100 --> 1:11:30.140]  good people now i know that police and others try
[1:11:30.140 --> 1:11:32.940]  to buck this and actually try to go out for bad guys i've seen it with my own
[1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:37.420]  eyes but it doesn't matter from on top
[1:11:37.420 --> 1:11:41.900]  and it's gotten a lot worse the last seven years no one can deny it
[1:11:43.260 --> 1:11:48.300]  we're in a lot of trouble so what do you think about this
[1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:51.340]  because i already showed you articles earlier
[1:11:51.340 --> 1:11:54.620]  where judges and people have been caught getting paid kickbacks for how many
[1:11:54.620 --> 1:11:57.660]  people they send to prison or to juvenile hall
[1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:01.020]  sometimes millions of dollars from the very companies
[1:12:01.020 --> 1:12:05.260]  that are housing people so they release the violent offenders they release the
[1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:08.780]  violent aggravated assaulters and in arsonist not just
[1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:13.020]  illegals but but citizens to keep the crime going and then they keep the
[1:12:13.020 --> 1:12:18.060]  nonviolent and house them because they're good slaves
[1:12:18.860 --> 1:12:21.660]  we're going to carl who's an active correctional officer they're going to
[1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:26.940]  bin in georgia his former police carl thanks for calling from wisconsin
[1:12:26.940 --> 1:12:31.820]  hi alex how you doing i'm okay brother go ahead
[1:12:31.820 --> 1:12:36.540]  everything you have said alex is spot on probation and parole revoke these
[1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:41.820]  inmates on the simplest little things we are overcrowded
[1:12:41.820 --> 1:12:45.900]  we're understaffed they are taking they're going to screw with our pension
[1:12:45.900 --> 1:12:50.140]  fund in the future oh yeah it's the globalist taken over alex
[1:12:50.140 --> 1:12:54.220]  everything you have said is spot on if people don't wake up
[1:12:54.220 --> 1:12:58.940]  and realize what's going on this country is going down the toilet
[1:12:58.940 --> 1:13:02.620]  we have a criminal instinct more and more in the highest levels of government
[1:13:02.620 --> 1:13:06.700]  corporations and it's trying to now get every level to follow criminal
[1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:09.980]  orders and if the locals and if the feds follow
[1:13:09.980 --> 1:13:13.180]  the criminal orders you're going to have a conversion to an absolute
[1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:16.540]  tyranny very quickly then the president's already acting
[1:13:16.540 --> 1:13:22.460]  as a dictator on borders on military on energy uh on on everything
[1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:28.060]  and so can you imagine what's coming next i mean this is mind-blowing
[1:13:28.060 --> 1:13:32.300]  absolutely after 18 years in the correctional system to see these
[1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:39.340]  people come back time after time get revoked new cases um old cases
[1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:43.820]  it is astounding the money that is wasted
[1:13:43.820 --> 1:13:47.260]  and this is taxpayer money alex this is our money
[1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:53.180]  oh i know it is used yeah and it's it's a crime
[1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:57.100]  it's a crime and it's not getting any better well just remember
[1:13:57.100 --> 1:14:00.460]  people in this country go ahead have to wake up
[1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:05.340]  they people in this country have to wake up and and realize what's going on
[1:14:05.340 --> 1:14:07.900]  because it is not going to get any better
[1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:11.260]  unless the people wake up and use their voting rights
[1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:15.740]  and elect these people out of office absolutely god bless you
[1:14:15.740 --> 1:14:19.340]  and again no one's saying we shouldn't have hardened criminals in jail
[1:14:19.340 --> 1:14:23.900]  it's come out in different university studies that that violent offenders get
[1:14:23.900 --> 1:14:27.260]  released more often illegals get released basically for anything you
[1:14:27.260 --> 1:14:31.100]  can imagine i mean every month the numbers come out
[1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:34.380]  thousands and thousands and thousands of aggravated felons
[1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:37.820]  are released because they're illegals
[1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:42.860]  and then they just throw the book at people they know aren't criminals
[1:14:42.860 --> 1:14:46.700]  because they'll go along with the system they'll pay all their debts
[1:14:46.700 --> 1:14:49.740]  to the system and the system is not even designed to keep going it's designed
[1:14:49.740 --> 1:14:52.300]  to implode
[1:14:52.380 --> 1:14:58.300]  we can't have an economy based on packing giant prisons full of people
[1:14:58.300 --> 1:15:00.700]  and you can take people that aren't criminals and put them in prison a couple
[1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:03.660]  times they become criminals because it's the only thing they now know they've
[1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:09.260]  gone to school to be criminals that's what prisons are colleges of crime
[1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:14.460]  i mean let me tell you i started going to public school when i was a kindergarten
[1:15:14.460 --> 1:15:17.420]  and i'm gonna go to your calls kindergarten and first grade then i was
[1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:22.780]  putting christian private school and then i was put back in public school
[1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:25.340]  because the irs had taken almost everything my dad had even though he
[1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:28.460]  hadn't quote cheated so he had money to go to private school
[1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:31.980]  and i was immediately being beaten up by people three four years older than me
[1:15:31.980 --> 1:15:35.180]  that had flunked in the sixth grade that should have been already in high
[1:15:35.180 --> 1:15:38.780]  school kids with mustaches and it was racial
[1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:41.180]  was hispanic and black students mainly beating me up
[1:15:41.180 --> 1:15:45.100]  i fought some of the rednecks a little bit later and
[1:15:45.100 --> 1:15:48.060]  no one would protect me because it was politically correct now i didn't join
[1:15:48.060 --> 1:15:51.260]  their gang and give them my lunch money and start toting to them they all have
[1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:53.500]  entourages of white kids that worshiped them and
[1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:57.020]  did whatever they said not me i fought and became meaner than hell
[1:15:57.020 --> 1:16:01.260]  and you know brain damage people and stuff i mean i got vicious
[1:16:01.260 --> 1:16:05.100]  but it was like a gladiator operation basically right up into high school we
[1:16:05.100 --> 1:16:07.340]  had to move down here to get away from this
[1:16:07.340 --> 1:16:10.380]  and it didn't like that under an awesome thank god but it's starting to get that
[1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:14.620]  way um but most people just submit to the
[1:16:14.620 --> 1:16:18.220]  gang mentality and basically become puppets of the gangs
[1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:23.020]  i didn't let's go ahead and uh talk to uh ben
[1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:28.620]  in georgia former police go ahead hey alec how you doing brother good what's
[1:16:28.620 --> 1:16:34.540]  your take on all this uh it's crazy i actually wanted to
[1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:37.820]  tell you a story if i could um it happened up in
[1:16:37.820 --> 1:16:43.020]  atlanta georgia and um basically uh atlanta pd got
[1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:45.580]  called somebody claimed the kid had a gun
[1:16:45.580 --> 1:16:48.620]  when they later checked the records no such kid exists
[1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:52.540]  in seconds fbi ats homeland security was there
[1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:55.980]  pointing guns at kids i mean i'm talking guys in straight
[1:16:55.980 --> 1:17:00.540]  swat here telling kids that basically if they don't answer their questions they're
[1:17:00.540 --> 1:17:03.660]  gonna throw them a federal lock up under the patriot act
[1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:07.260]  and um basically reporters got threatened the stories know where to be
[1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:09.740]  found because parents threatened us through the fbi
[1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:13.260]  to the school but the school said when your kids are here they don't have any
[1:17:13.260 --> 1:17:17.340]  civil liberties by the way there was a story under clinton um
[1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:20.620]  in the pennsycola news journal that became national
[1:17:20.620 --> 1:17:24.380]  worldland ellie picked it up back when i was covering it
[1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:27.740]  and the marines came in and said bill clinton wants you to know what marshal
[1:17:27.740 --> 1:17:31.340]  law is like we'll be coming for your guns soon and it turned out it was a
[1:17:31.340 --> 1:17:34.780]  clinton-ordered operation everywhere to sign off the kids
[1:17:34.780 --> 1:17:40.620]  but it actually backfired on them what happened in this bizarre case
[1:17:40.620 --> 1:17:43.980]  there was no such kid and they thought that
[1:17:43.980 --> 1:17:46.860]  because they later checked the records because the school
[1:17:46.860 --> 1:17:50.140]  i think something like 50 parents threatened to sue the school and there
[1:17:50.140 --> 1:17:54.220]  was one parent that was actually a federal prosecutor who was outraged that
[1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:58.220]  men with guns were pointing it at their kids searching them treating them like
[1:17:58.220 --> 1:18:01.740]  they're hardened criminals well you know they did that with the gun drills
[1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:05.340]  bringing the guns in in quote drills set the precedent to aim guns at the
[1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:08.060]  kids but yes i've seen cases like this before wow
[1:18:08.060 --> 1:18:11.340]  so when was this because i never heard about it
[1:18:11.340 --> 1:18:15.740]  this was in 2013 it totally i swept under the rug i think that
[1:18:15.740 --> 1:18:19.420]  i have heard that local journalists were threatened by the feds
[1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:22.620]  over this i mean and there was actually
[1:18:22.620 --> 1:18:25.820]  um a buddy of mine said that the sheriffs were actually told to leave this
[1:18:25.820 --> 1:18:29.180]  the federal operation or whatever i don't know if they actually said that but
[1:18:29.180 --> 1:18:32.300]  they basically said well sir we'd like you to send us an email
[1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:34.940]  or we put you on hold the name of the school any information we'd like to
[1:18:34.940 --> 1:18:37.660]  investigate it we don't we don't care if we get threatened
[1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:40.540]  we'll go on to the end whatever the cost may be
[1:18:40.540 --> 1:18:42.940]  you know what's weird do you would think somebody
[1:18:42.940 --> 1:18:46.380]  would this would be front page news when you have literally
[1:18:46.380 --> 1:18:52.060]  40 federal agencies to lock your point in guns at 14 to 16 year old kids but
[1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:55.340]  it just got swept under the rug when they said there was no such kid it was
[1:18:55.340 --> 1:18:58.940]  probably a psyop when they do something that big it's usually a
[1:18:58.940 --> 1:19:05.100]  psyop test probably testing the feds to see which ones would say no see
[1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:08.300]  this is all run by psychological warfare experts
[1:19:08.300 --> 1:19:14.860]  so so so the most manipulated group are the police and the feds themselves
[1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:18.620]  and um i don't know if you're familiar with the fbi hot dress you seem to pretty
[1:19:18.620 --> 1:19:21.820]  much uh in a nutshell it's a paramilitary
[1:19:21.820 --> 1:19:24.540]  it's an execution squad yes i'm familiar with them
[1:19:24.540 --> 1:19:28.620]  pretty much paramilitary death squad and you literally have these guys so you
[1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:31.900]  can tell the former marines they probably joined the fbi just to relive
[1:19:31.900 --> 1:19:35.820]  their past glories and they're literally treating kids
[1:19:35.820 --> 1:19:38.620]  like you could literally just see them getting so i don't want to say a
[1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:43.020]  sexual thrill offer but they just they're loving the power trip of it all
[1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:46.620]  they they don't care and parents were
[1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:49.660]  threatened to the fbi well sir we're going to put you on hold if you want to
[1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:52.300]  give us more info the name of the school very interesting we're going to come
[1:19:52.300 --> 1:19:56.380]  back with tony wife is police uh robert corrections officer dug former

[1:25:09.900 --> 1:25:13.820]  coming out more and more uh what's your take on this tony
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:18.940]  hey don alex pretty good my wife yeah she was a deputy sheriff for 20 plus years
[1:25:18.940 --> 1:25:23.420]  and uh got out last year just because of you know all the corruption and
[1:25:23.420 --> 1:25:26.620]  and uh you know they're handing out the flyers like you've shown before about
[1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:30.140]  the you know sovereign citizens how dangerous they are and you know that's
[1:25:30.140 --> 1:25:34.460]  the kind of stuff they're emphasizing on and uh just recently there was a
[1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:38.540]  funeral for a former deputy who was you know corrupt and he killed himself
[1:25:38.540 --> 1:25:41.260]  because of the corruption you know he finally got caught and
[1:25:41.260 --> 1:25:45.020]  he decided to kill himself and uh at the at the
[1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:48.620]  the viewing there was a couple of the judges i had met before and i was talking
[1:25:48.620 --> 1:25:52.220]  to them and just bringing up different things and uh
[1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:55.180]  basically kind of picking their brains because i had already kind of had a
[1:25:55.180 --> 1:25:58.060]  relationship with them just knowing them and talking to them
[1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:02.540]  and uh they basically just admit like the whole legal person thing
[1:26:02.540 --> 1:26:05.500]  and that they trick you to be the surety for it
[1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:10.620]  and it's the word game in the court and uh you know the case it's their case
[1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:14.140]  and you know by you stepping into it you're becoming surety for that legal
[1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:16.540]  thing i mean they're just admitting it and laughing because they know no one's
[1:26:16.540 --> 1:26:19.340]  going to believe me you know they who am i going to tell that's going to believe
[1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:23.020]  this unless someone that studied this i was talking to top lawyers yesterday
[1:26:23.020 --> 1:26:27.420]  and they were admitting that sometimes they'll just shove a piece of paper
[1:26:27.420 --> 1:26:31.580]  under the door because they won't even go into the court and then they'll
[1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:34.300]  when they're making filings that it's the wrong court or not the right
[1:26:34.300 --> 1:26:38.620]  jurisdiction but citizens pull that they'll have you arrested
[1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:43.420]  remotely but uh you know the i i called before and i threw out a guy's name and
[1:26:43.420 --> 1:26:45.740]  i know you don't like you know when people do that so i'm not going to do it
[1:26:45.740 --> 1:26:49.820]  again but you know this guy's really you know showing people how not to go
[1:26:49.820 --> 1:26:53.580]  into their court to follow your own claim not to use their paperwork
[1:26:53.580 --> 1:26:56.220]  and a lot of the stuff that you know i was throwing at these guys they were
[1:26:56.220 --> 1:26:58.700]  admitting they were acknowledging they're not considering it paper
[1:26:58.700 --> 1:27:01.580]  terrorism because this guy's telling you to shut your mouth when you're in there
[1:27:01.580 --> 1:27:05.020]  well sure the problem is there's a lot of real patriot stuff
[1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:08.140]  and and pro se litigants statistically have been more successful
[1:27:08.140 --> 1:27:11.180]  in past years i saw like an ap article on that a few years ago
[1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:15.500]  there's a lot of quackery too so yes there are people out there that know
[1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:18.860]  what they're doing and i have some of them on air it's just that
[1:27:18.860 --> 1:27:24.300]  still you can't do this halfway and even if you're in the right
[1:27:24.300 --> 1:27:27.740]  if you get a boss hog they can try to put you under the jail
[1:27:27.740 --> 1:27:31.820]  so uh i appreciate your call anything else tony
[1:27:31.820 --> 1:27:34.860]  yeah i was just amazed at like how easily they just admit it when you know
[1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:38.140]  there aren't many people around and and kind of like it's almost a joke to them
[1:27:38.140 --> 1:27:41.260]  you know what i mean that that it's fine at the same time that they don't see
[1:27:41.260 --> 1:27:45.100]  how they're destroying the whole country and hurting themselves and
[1:27:45.100 --> 1:27:47.900]  it's it's ridiculous well yeah i mean we now have the government
[1:27:47.900 --> 1:27:52.700]  officially telling the board of patrol and ice let illegals commit crimes it's
[1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:55.980]  not just drunk driving and if they kill somebody it's not your fault
[1:27:55.980 --> 1:28:00.380]  that violates so many laws and common sense it's just mind blowing
[1:28:00.380 --> 1:28:04.060]  we've reached the point of just total insanity i appreciate your call
[1:28:04.060 --> 1:28:07.500]  great points uh roberts the corrections officer
[1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:12.940]  on police quotas go ahead yeah alex i'm uh right up the road
[1:28:12.940 --> 1:28:16.380]  from where this whole little municipality went down
[1:28:16.380 --> 1:28:19.500]  um here's the situation and it's right near
[1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:23.660]  virkuson as well where george soros pumped all that money in to uh do the
[1:28:23.660 --> 1:28:28.620]  scyhop on my community and i i really appreciate mr soros and his 33 million
[1:28:28.620 --> 1:28:32.460]  freaking dollars but anyway here's the thing you've got this
[1:28:32.460 --> 1:28:36.380]  thing that's happening in st louis and it happens all over the uh country it's
[1:28:36.380 --> 1:28:40.860]  called urban sprawl slash white flight and this is one of those communities
[1:28:40.860 --> 1:28:45.420]  that's a victim of it and the the poor victims of charlotte iserby's
[1:28:45.420 --> 1:28:48.620]  deliberate dumbing down of america caused the white people to
[1:28:48.620 --> 1:28:52.540]  leave because it's all just a hotbed of thuggery
[1:28:52.540 --> 1:28:57.580]  and so then the tax base falls out and uh guess what then they order these cops
[1:28:57.580 --> 1:29:01.500]  to start giving people tickets in order to keep the revenue going in order to
[1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:04.620]  just run basic services in these ghost towns that
[1:29:04.620 --> 1:29:08.860]  have turned into places where you don't even want to hang out
[1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:12.700]  and uh like that last caller said here's the thing

[1:33:25.900 --> 1:33:29.180]  this hour we're going to be talking to callers on the line who've been calling
[1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:34.460]  in about this issue that came up in missouri now about making arrests and
[1:33:34.460 --> 1:33:37.100]  having ticket quotas this is something we've seen
[1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:41.100]  a lot of this is something that was exposed by adrian schoolcraft in the
[1:33:41.100 --> 1:33:45.180]  new york police department a huge huge whistleblower case there
[1:33:45.180 --> 1:33:50.060]  he later went on to talk about what the nypd was doing in terms of their stop
[1:33:50.060 --> 1:33:54.380]  and frisk their program of just pulling people over and frisking them
[1:33:54.380 --> 1:33:59.100]  because they feel like it without any probable cause whatsoever
[1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:03.420]  adrian schoolcraft was recording for years what was going on in his police
[1:34:03.420 --> 1:34:07.020]  department this was an honest cop his dad had been a cop he was very idealistic
[1:34:07.020 --> 1:34:10.540]  he was very concerned about this quota system that was going on
[1:34:10.540 --> 1:34:15.100]  he was concerned about different issues i remember listening to the audio tapes
[1:34:15.100 --> 1:34:18.700]  they were telling them on a halloween just go out and grab three people
[1:34:18.700 --> 1:34:22.860]  don't even just bring them back put them in the pen don't fill out any paperwork
[1:34:22.860 --> 1:34:25.180]  we'll figure out what we're going to charge them with later but just get
[1:34:25.180 --> 1:34:27.740]  three people then go back out and get another three people and then at the
[1:34:27.740 --> 1:34:30.380]  end of the night we'll we'll run charges on we just got to get our arrest
[1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:33.340]  numbers up he was concerned about the fact that they were
[1:34:33.340 --> 1:34:36.620]  harassing people endlessly for things that they could
[1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:39.820]  petty petty crimes that they could make a lot of revenue off of
[1:34:39.820 --> 1:34:44.300]  things like they killed eric garner for and yet for serious crimes they didn't
[1:34:44.300 --> 1:34:48.220]  want to look bad in the fbi statistics so they would actually pressure people
[1:34:48.220 --> 1:34:53.020]  to not report serious crimes like rape like car theft if you reported a car
[1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:55.660]  theft they would come there's you know this is going to be so much paperwork
[1:34:55.660 --> 1:35:00.300]  it's going to take so much of your time you really don't want to do this to you
[1:35:00.300 --> 1:35:04.380]  i mean don't you kind of remember that you loaned this to your cousin and
[1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:07.740]  and uh he hasn't brought it back yet isn't isn't that what happened don't
[1:35:07.740 --> 1:35:10.940]  you kind of remember that giving them an idea and yeah that's it so then they
[1:35:10.940 --> 1:35:15.020]  would write that down and then they they wouldn't have any fbi statistics on
[1:35:15.020 --> 1:35:19.260]  serious crime nevertheless when it came to petty rule violations
[1:35:19.260 --> 1:35:22.780]  about people smoking in a barbershop or the barbers because they couldn't
[1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:26.460]  smoke in their own barbershop going in front of the barbershop and standing
[1:35:26.460 --> 1:35:30.460]  there getting charged with loitering for that they were all over them
[1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:33.980]  and we just saw this last holiday season
[1:35:33.980 --> 1:35:38.220]  that the nypd being angry with the mayor there de Blasio said we're going to do
[1:35:38.220 --> 1:35:42.860]  a work stoppage we're going to cut your revenue by 10 million dollars a week
[1:35:42.860 --> 1:35:45.660]  by not writing tickets for petty stuff they said we're not going to write
[1:35:45.660 --> 1:35:50.140]  tickets or arrest people unless it's absolutely necessary
[1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:54.780]  what a novel idea not arresting people or writing tickets to them
[1:35:54.780 --> 1:35:59.260]  unless it's absolutely necessary they cut it by 95 percent and guess what
[1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:03.500]  serious crime fell as well they didn't have a single arrest
[1:36:03.500 --> 1:36:08.140]  on new year's eve but unfortunately that's changed now they went back about
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:11.900]  the middle of january they went back to business as usual
[1:36:11.900 --> 1:36:15.100]  a lot of pressure from the police captains and
[1:36:15.100 --> 1:36:19.260]  the brass who was working for city hall and we need to step back and ask
[1:36:19.260 --> 1:36:22.780]  ourselves what the real purpose of the police is
[1:36:22.780 --> 1:36:26.140]  what is the real purpose of our government is it there to protect our
[1:36:26.140 --> 1:36:29.260]  rights that's what the declaration of independence says
[1:36:29.260 --> 1:36:33.500]  does a just government govern only when it has the consent of the governed
[1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:37.020]  are we consenting to this are they doing things that we really don't want them
[1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:39.100]  to do how do we get this back i want to go
[1:36:39.100 --> 1:36:42.620]  right back to robert in missouri but real quickly before i do
[1:36:42.620 --> 1:36:45.820]  i want to let you know that this hour the alex jones show is brought to you by

[1:37:13.340 --> 1:37:17.420]  iodine x2 let's go back to robert in missouri robert
[1:37:17.420 --> 1:37:20.460]  go ahead and continue with what you're talking about
[1:37:20.460 --> 1:37:24.380]  yeah well you know this this metamorphosis is to where these uh
[1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:27.820]  these entities that call themselves municipalities have become
[1:37:27.820 --> 1:37:32.540]  um just strictly on the corporate model where basically now the police are just
[1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:37.500]  uh corporate revenue generators versus protecting the people within those
[1:37:37.500 --> 1:37:42.460]  um entities themselves and you know i i i work behind bars i've been doing this
[1:37:42.460 --> 1:37:46.700]  for almost 20 years and you know where i work i'm not
[1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:50.060]  going to say where but there's a whole unit full of pedophiles and then there's
[1:37:50.060 --> 1:37:53.820]  units full of people that do first-degree robberies arm robberies
[1:37:53.820 --> 1:37:57.660]  there's burglars there's uh drug addicts that got to go steal to get
[1:37:57.660 --> 1:38:00.940]  their high and then we could get into the drug war and we could talk about that
[1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:05.020]  all day why the price for these drugs is so high
[1:38:05.020 --> 1:38:08.700]  that makes these addicts go out and steal to get their high
[1:38:08.700 --> 1:38:12.540]  and then and then we've got these these large federal agencies that that
[1:38:12.540 --> 1:38:15.820]  import the the heroin straight from afghanistan
[1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:19.340]  and bring it here and here in the midwest i'm smack dab in the middle of
[1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:24.700]  this country and heroin is an absolute epidemic cocaine is almost
[1:38:24.700 --> 1:38:28.780]  disappeared heroin is everywhere all these 20-something
[1:38:28.780 --> 1:38:33.340]  year-old kids that i see almost all of them are heroin junkies
[1:38:33.340 --> 1:38:37.660]  and this has created this problem to where the jails are getting full of
[1:38:37.660 --> 1:38:40.060]  these people because they're committing crimes such as
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:43.980]  thieves um stealing burglary and so forth to keep that
[1:38:43.980 --> 1:38:47.420]  high because when you when you can't get high off heroin folks
[1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:50.540]  it's it's these people go through hell i watch people
[1:38:50.540 --> 1:38:54.700]  depicate on themselves you're uh vomit everywhere
[1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:58.700]  when they're coming off of this stuff and it is an absolute poison it changes
[1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:02.860]  them forever and it's almost like these people become a lost cause they'll be
[1:39:02.860 --> 1:39:05.740]  sober for six months while they're locked up in these places
[1:39:05.740 --> 1:39:08.940]  and the first thing they do is run out and get a shot of heroin
[1:39:08.940 --> 1:39:12.700]  and sometimes it kills them because that's just the way it is
[1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:16.060]  and so this revenue generation thing that happened right down the road from
[1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:19.100]  where i live this is just a symptomatic of the
[1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:24.700]  implosion of our economy because the free trades really the thing i mean
[1:39:24.700 --> 1:39:29.020]  they sent all the manufacturing jobs elsewhere for that cheap labor and then
[1:39:29.020 --> 1:39:32.220]  they import the stuff and then they still sell it for the same price
[1:39:32.220 --> 1:39:36.700]  while all these kids there's no jobs out here we're going to a total economic
[1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:39.420]  implosion and it's just a it it's a horrible
[1:39:39.420 --> 1:39:44.060]  situation to watch the corruption the robber you talked about how so much of
[1:39:44.060 --> 1:39:46.460]  the heroin you're getting flooded whether you're not seeing cocaine so much
[1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:50.780]  anymore and of course heroin uh coming in opium products coming out of
[1:39:50.780 --> 1:39:54.060]  afghanistan were down to only 10 percent of the world supply before the u.s
[1:39:54.060 --> 1:39:57.100]  military went there as part of our intervention in afghanistan
[1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.180]  then they went up to over 90 percent of the world supply we've got video of
[1:40:01.180 --> 1:40:04.460]  herald over vero talking to the troops and saying that you're guarding
[1:40:04.460 --> 1:40:07.260]  the fields here for these people to raise
[1:40:07.260 --> 1:40:12.220]  poppies every year they're having a bumper crop so if you want to know the
[1:40:12.220 --> 1:40:16.860]  source of the heroin epidemic it's coming from the american government
[1:40:16.860 --> 1:40:20.700]  that is there facilitating it not just importing it but facilitating it in the
[1:40:20.700 --> 1:40:24.460]  same way that they facilitated the previous epidemic of cocaine and crack
[1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:28.700]  cocaine as gary web pointed out in dark alliance they were using that
[1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:33.740]  to fund their dark operations and bringing in and creating the crack cocaine
[1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:36.700]  epidemic uh that that swept through the country so
[1:40:36.700 --> 1:40:40.220]  they work both sides of prohibition they use prohibition
[1:40:40.220 --> 1:40:45.020]  to destroy the rule of law they use it to set up unconstitutional civil asset
[1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:50.380]  asset forfeiture and they also profit from it by being the suppliers to it
[1:40:50.380 --> 1:40:53.900]  and then they have the private prisons who make the money out of all the people
[1:40:53.900 --> 1:40:56.460]  that they put in prison and of course we've incarcerated more people per
[1:40:56.460 --> 1:40:59.340]  capita than any other country in the world in
[1:40:59.340 --> 1:41:02.940]  history far more than uh communist china far more than
[1:41:02.940 --> 1:41:05.740]  russia uh robert did you want to add anything before we go to uh the other
[1:41:05.740 --> 1:41:09.020]  callers on here real quickly there's tons of people
[1:41:09.020 --> 1:41:12.460]  that i can that consider themselves sovereigns that are locked up right now
[1:41:12.460 --> 1:41:16.060]  and the courts will not even entertain their arguments they will laugh them out
[1:41:16.060 --> 1:41:19.420]  of court and they say yeah go do some more time buddy so
[1:41:19.420 --> 1:41:22.460]  the courts themselves are lawless they will not even
[1:41:22.460 --> 1:41:25.980]  uh they will not even entertain arguments it depends on the
[1:41:25.980 --> 1:41:29.180]  the municipality in a county or whether it's in federal court
[1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:32.940]  so sometimes this sovereign thing yeah it's right on paper but guess what
[1:41:32.940 --> 1:41:36.540]  the judges are criminals and so therefore they laugh these people right out of
[1:41:36.540 --> 1:41:39.420]  court and one more thing with a limit illegal immigration
[1:41:39.420 --> 1:41:44.460]  pedophilia if you look at these uh units where we hold pedophiles there's
[1:41:44.460 --> 1:41:47.980]  an alarming number of these people are illegal immigrants so they're bringing
[1:41:47.980 --> 1:41:51.260]  this culture with them where they rape little kids like
[1:41:51.260 --> 1:41:54.620]  in mexico and so forth and now they're filling up
[1:41:54.620 --> 1:41:59.180]  our pedophile units behind bars i figured i'd throw that one at you too
[1:41:59.180 --> 1:42:02.220]  well you know it's amazing when you're talking about how the judges will just
[1:42:02.220 --> 1:42:05.500]  throw stuff out we see that all the time i mean a good example of that is the
[1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:09.820]  fundamental perversion of the idea of the purpose of a jury
[1:42:09.820 --> 1:42:13.580]  and of course we could if we understood and stood up for our rights if we
[1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:16.860]  understood what a jury is for if we understood that it's not there just to
[1:42:16.860 --> 1:42:21.100]  rubber stamp what the judge in the court is telling you it's not there just to
[1:42:21.100 --> 1:42:24.860]  judge the facts of the case it's there to judge whether the law
[1:42:24.860 --> 1:42:27.740]  is something that you want in your community whether it's being applied
[1:42:27.740 --> 1:42:30.620]  fairly whether the punishment is something that you want to extend to
[1:42:30.620 --> 1:42:33.420]  people so clearly if i looked at this as a juror
[1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:37.500]  i would not send somebody to jail if there was a mandatory minimum involved
[1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:40.860]  without any discretion on it i would shut that down they were shutting down
[1:42:40.860 --> 1:42:45.500]  alcohol prohibition by jury before they uh changed it again with the
[1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:49.580]  constitution and of course that brings up the point i always bring out why is it
[1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:52.860]  that we had to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol
[1:42:52.860 --> 1:42:56.700]  and we didn't need a constitutional amendment to prohibit anything else
[1:42:56.700 --> 1:43:00.540]  nothing else not medical marijuana nothing else the government just says
[1:43:00.540 --> 1:43:04.060]  it's prohibited we've got two constitutional amendments one to prohibit
[1:43:04.060 --> 1:43:07.740]  alcohol one to make it constitutional again why is it that we don't have to
[1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:11.100]  have that for anything else well the clearly the answer is is that no one
[1:43:11.100 --> 1:43:14.140]  in the government at any level could care less
[1:43:14.140 --> 1:43:17.900]  about what the constitution says it's a dead letter and as you're talking about
[1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:21.740]  the corruption is so extensive that it is pervasive throughout the court
[1:43:21.740 --> 1:43:25.340]  systems the uh lying to the jurors by judges and
[1:43:25.340 --> 1:43:28.940]  their instructions about what the purpose of the jury is is just one
[1:43:28.940 --> 1:43:32.540]  example punishing anybody who is a lawyer who brings up
[1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:36.060]  a jury nullification that's another example and of course
[1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:39.420]  most people who are successful jury nullification are doing it uh pro se
[1:43:39.420 --> 1:43:42.220]  they're they're representing themselves like the new jersey weed man one of the
[1:43:42.220 --> 1:43:45.820]  first stories i covered when i came here to info wars
[1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:49.100]  but i i think it's to the point where we're not going to see somebody we're
[1:43:49.100 --> 1:43:52.860]  not going to be able to send a mr smith to washington and get everything fixed
[1:43:52.860 --> 1:43:55.420]  there isn't going to be any senator there isn't going to be any president
[1:43:55.420 --> 1:43:59.420]  that's going to fix this we have a massive metastasizing
[1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:05.500]  feral government it's wild it doesn't respond to anything the chains of the
[1:44:05.500 --> 1:44:09.100]  constitution have come off the only way if it's not too
[1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:13.180]  late to shut this down is at the state level if we can find some honest people
[1:44:13.180 --> 1:44:16.700]  here let's go to some other uh former law enforcement officers dug in maryland
[1:44:16.700 --> 1:44:20.860]  dug uh hello mr night how you doing today i'm doing
[1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:24.220]  good thank you for having me on and i'll pray for
[1:44:24.220 --> 1:44:28.060]  out that's going to see his family there thank you i wanted to give you a
[1:44:28.060 --> 1:44:31.740]  little bit of insight can't stay on too long because i'm driving to work but i
[1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:35.900]  wanted to give you a little insight on how quotas work i'm former nyp did
[1:44:35.900 --> 1:44:39.980]  um so then you know about the age of school craft
[1:44:39.980 --> 1:44:45.260]  the situation yeah i do actually yeah um there's two different agencies that
[1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:49.660]  actually produce uh revenue for that okay police obviously and then they have
[1:44:49.660 --> 1:44:55.180]  traffic enforcement agents um we used to call them brownies as tops which is kind
[1:44:55.180 --> 1:45:01.100]  of a derogatory term but um what they basically do for punishing the police
[1:45:01.100 --> 1:45:05.740]  officers just to give you an idea is if you don't make your quote or your
[1:45:05.740 --> 1:45:11.420]  recommended daily monthly amount uh they'll stick you on post
[1:45:11.420 --> 1:45:17.260]  example would be um i have personally been on this post for not doing it
[1:45:17.260 --> 1:45:20.940]  um they'll stick you on the brooklyn bridge in january
[1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:24.380]  walking back and forth on the bridge
[1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:27.980]  well not good if you've ever walked the brooklyn bridge in january
[1:45:27.980 --> 1:45:31.500]  um but i don't think i'd want to walk in at any time it's so much traffic but
[1:45:31.500 --> 1:45:34.300]  yeah go ahead that'd be pretty horrible yeah
[1:45:34.300 --> 1:45:37.260]  so or they'll stick you in a location like
[1:45:37.260 --> 1:45:41.020]  you uh you work in brooklyn and when that you work in the box
[1:45:41.020 --> 1:45:44.940]  so now it's harder for you to get to work obviously
[1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:48.540]  and those are the minor punishments as well as trying to get you fired
[1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:52.860]  they'll um you know run internal affairs on you you know dougie mentioned
[1:45:52.860 --> 1:45:55.340]  doing that they they did that to adrian schoolcraft they said all right you're
[1:45:55.340 --> 1:45:59.180]  going to walk the beat as a cop and you know he was happy with that
[1:45:59.180 --> 1:46:02.940]  that's what he saw his job as a cop he got to know the people in the community
[1:46:02.940 --> 1:46:06.540]  they got to know him they trusted him he didn't harass them for minor
[1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:09.580]  violations like we were talking about he was there when there was a serious
[1:46:09.580 --> 1:46:14.220]  crime he actually liked that so it didn't work for him because he was a real cop
[1:46:14.220 --> 1:46:17.340]  but i understand walking the brooklyn bridge in the middle of winter that's
[1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:21.340]  that's pretty severe duty go ahead i'm sorry yeah and the beauty of what you
[1:46:21.340 --> 1:46:24.700]  just said that a foot post is great because exactly what you said you know
[1:46:24.700 --> 1:46:27.340]  all the parents you know all the store owners so
[1:46:27.340 --> 1:46:30.780]  something happened with this example little johnny does something
[1:46:30.780 --> 1:46:34.620]  hey johnny did this and then you can deal with the situation before it gets
[1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:37.100]  serious exactly and that's the way the cops used to be when
[1:46:37.100 --> 1:46:39.580]  you go back and you look at the way they talked about cops
[1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:42.220]  you know in the early part of the 20th century in new york where you look at
[1:46:42.220 --> 1:46:47.500]  the way the bobby's used to be in in england i remember in the 1980s when
[1:46:47.500 --> 1:46:51.660]  i first went there uh they're walking two by two they weren't armed they they
[1:46:51.660 --> 1:46:56.060]  you know did foot patrols uh when i went back several decades later
[1:46:56.060 --> 1:46:59.900]  um they were in police cars like the american cops and they were carrying
[1:46:59.900 --> 1:47:02.620]  guns most of them and they were detached from the people
[1:47:02.620 --> 1:47:06.220]  the only thing that they were noticing were traffic violations and that's
[1:47:06.220 --> 1:47:09.660]  where they because that's what their focus was
[1:47:09.660 --> 1:47:12.300]  exactly and that's what they did in new york they put them they put two of them
[1:47:12.300 --> 1:47:15.500]  in the car and they they trolled them there's hardly a foot post unless it's
[1:47:15.500 --> 1:47:20.620]  working bridge uh it's not your foot post anymore so
[1:47:20.620 --> 1:47:24.380]  you know you you you're detached exactly what you said detached from
[1:47:24.380 --> 1:47:27.900]  to you know the people society so what do you think is the solution to this
[1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:30.140]  what i mean you talked about how it's kind of a
[1:47:30.140 --> 1:47:33.180]  a corporate situation on the previous color did
[1:47:33.180 --> 1:47:36.780]  where we don't really have especially with police we don't have
[1:47:36.780 --> 1:47:39.900]  elections for police chief we have election for sheriff it's a very
[1:47:39.900 --> 1:47:43.580]  different situation uh i mean should we have municipal police
[1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:47.420]  departments or are they too hard to control
[1:47:47.420 --> 1:47:50.940]  i need to be honest with you i think they should elect them off because at least
[1:47:50.940 --> 1:47:55.100]  the people are are um you know making the decision
[1:47:55.100 --> 1:47:59.340]  exactly on who they want and and leading that you know leading the police
[1:47:59.340 --> 1:48:01.660]  far i feel that way i think if they're going to
[1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:05.260]  have a municipal police department they ought to stand for election just like a
[1:48:05.260 --> 1:48:07.260]  sheriff and if you've got a police force that is
[1:48:07.260 --> 1:48:11.180]  unaccountable to the people that shouldn't exist and that's the problem
[1:48:11.180 --> 1:48:14.220]  that we have really to take it the analogy to the federal government
[1:48:14.220 --> 1:48:16.380]  that's the problem we have with the federal government we have the
[1:48:16.380 --> 1:48:19.660]  bureaucracies who are writing the laws calling them regulations they're
[1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:22.700]  created by congress and then congress just lets them run loose just like
[1:48:22.700 --> 1:48:25.900]  Pelosi said we got to pass obama care so we can find out what's in it
[1:48:25.900 --> 1:48:28.700]  well they got to create these different agencies so they can find out what
[1:48:28.700 --> 1:48:32.220]  they're going to do and eventually if it gets really bad congress will come in
[1:48:32.220 --> 1:48:34.860]  like a white knight and try to get them under control and take the credit for
[1:48:34.860 --> 1:48:39.420]  that but congress has abdicated its its responsibility its duty
[1:48:39.420 --> 1:48:43.260]  this lawful authority to write the laws they've they've delegated that
[1:48:43.260 --> 1:48:46.860]  to this permanent entrenched unaccountable bureaucracy
[1:48:46.860 --> 1:48:49.900]  over and over throughout our government i mean it started with the irs but now
[1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:53.740]  every bureaucracy works that way and i think that's one of the problems with
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:56.220]  law enforcement i want to get some of the other callers thank you so much
[1:48:56.220 --> 1:49:00.140]  dug let's go to greg and arizona greg
[1:49:00.140 --> 1:49:03.820]  yes they're a correctional officer and arizona former
[1:49:03.820 --> 1:49:10.460]  special forces engineer and i see a lot of these inmates coming in
[1:49:10.460 --> 1:49:16.540]  and they are under you know some drug
[1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:22.540]  uh they did something with drugs and then they get further into the gangs they
[1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:26.540]  get the tattoos all of themselves and they
[1:49:26.540 --> 1:49:33.500]  basically give in to the criminality and they they can't get out
[1:49:33.500 --> 1:49:38.220]  now with this economy yeah yeah and that's part of the problem also don't
[1:49:38.220 --> 1:49:42.300]  you think of arresting people for things that are nonviolent crimes and putting
[1:49:42.300 --> 1:49:45.180]  them in jail for a very long time with the mandatory minimums
[1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:49.020]  80 of the people who are sent to jail with the war on drugs are for
[1:49:49.020 --> 1:49:53.340]  nonviolent marijuana crimes and what that does is that hardens them
[1:49:53.340 --> 1:49:57.020]  it not only destroys their life not only takes them out of society
[1:49:57.020 --> 1:50:00.220]  of course it makes a lot of profit for the private prison companies
[1:50:00.220 --> 1:50:05.180]  but it also puts them into a criminal culture as well don't you think
[1:50:05.180 --> 1:50:11.500]  oh very much so um the thing about it is is that they can't even keep the
[1:50:11.500 --> 1:50:15.340]  drugs out of the prison yes which are supposed to be
[1:50:15.340 --> 1:50:20.060]  you know preeminent security and are they going to keep it out of the
[1:50:20.060 --> 1:50:22.540]  country absolutely we've made that point multiple
[1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:25.740]  times you know they're every year that's i'm glad you brought that up every
[1:50:25.740 --> 1:50:29.180]  year there are multiple deaths from drug overdoses
[1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:33.020]  inside of prisons i remember a story in maryland there was a mother her
[1:50:33.020 --> 1:50:36.540]  her son was addicted to drugs and she tried everything to try to get him off
[1:50:36.540 --> 1:50:38.860]  of drugs so she called the police on him
[1:50:38.860 --> 1:50:43.260]  they put him in prison and he died from an overdose in prison
[1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:46.220]  she said it was worse than when he was on the outside
[1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:51.500]  if we cannot control drugs with force on the inside of a prison
[1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:55.020]  what kind of a prison society are we trying to build here in this country
[1:50:55.020 --> 1:50:59.420]  stay with us we'll be right back with more callers

[1:53:58.060 --> 1:54:23.900]  welcome back to The Alex Jones Show i'm David Knight we're taking your calls calls from
[1:54:23.900 --> 1:54:27.980]  ex-police officers or current police officers talking about this
[1:54:27.980 --> 1:54:32.220]  article that's up on info wars.com about a Missouri officer who blew the whistle
[1:54:32.220 --> 1:54:37.740]  on the fact that they were using essentially 75% of their time to
[1:54:37.740 --> 1:54:42.860]  write tickets and generate revenue and so that of course is a very common thing
[1:54:42.860 --> 1:54:45.580]  we saw it to a large extent in New York City
[1:54:45.580 --> 1:54:49.100]  the last person i was just talking to Greg from Arizona
[1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:52.700]  worked in the prisons was talking about how it just made them
[1:54:52.700 --> 1:54:55.660]  worse to go to prison which is of course is part of the
[1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:58.620]  reason that we have these mandatory minimums perhaps
[1:54:58.620 --> 1:55:02.220]  we've known this for a long time as Rob Jacobson just handed me an article
[1:55:02.220 --> 1:55:05.900]  going back to 2009 from the UK overcrowded prisons
[1:55:05.900 --> 1:55:10.620]  act as a university of crime absolutely a university of crime for the young
[1:55:10.620 --> 1:55:14.700]  they say simply building more prisons is an expensive dead end yet here we are
[1:55:14.700 --> 1:55:18.620]  six years later that's precisely what we're doing and before we go back to
[1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:21.260]  your phone calls there's an article that just went up on info wars.com
[1:55:21.260 --> 1:55:26.060]  Daniel had Obama suggest Islamic extremists have quote
[1:55:26.060 --> 1:55:29.900]  legitimate grievances hey you know these guys they need jobs
[1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:34.460]  they need a democratic process he says President Obama suggested that radical
[1:55:34.460 --> 1:55:38.620]  Islamic groups like ISIS which beheads Christians and other Muslims
[1:55:38.620 --> 1:55:42.220]  for not obeying sharia law can only be stopped if governments are willing to
[1:55:42.220 --> 1:55:45.900]  listen to their quote legitimate grievances he says this is Obama
[1:55:45.900 --> 1:55:49.020]  talking governments that deny human rights play into the
[1:55:49.020 --> 1:55:52.380]  hands of extremists who claim that violence is the only way to achieve
[1:55:52.380 --> 1:55:55.420]  change efforts to counter violent extremism will only
[1:55:55.420 --> 1:55:58.860]  succeed if citizens can address legitimate grievances through the
[1:55:58.860 --> 1:56:02.140]  democratic process and express themselves through strong
[1:56:02.140 --> 1:56:05.980]  civil societies the irony of that statement
[1:56:05.980 --> 1:56:09.900]  here we just had an election the key issues were that we didn't want to have
[1:56:09.900 --> 1:56:13.260]  open borders we didn't want Obamacare we didn't want corporate
[1:56:13.260 --> 1:56:18.140]  mandated insurance to be forced upon us for his corporate cronies
[1:56:18.140 --> 1:56:21.420]  and now they're talking about forcing vaccines on us we're going to be taking
[1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:25.180]  your calls in the next hour about personal experiences that you've had
[1:56:25.180 --> 1:56:28.620]  with vaccines they're removing informed consent from vaccines just as they
[1:56:28.620 --> 1:56:31.900]  removed informed consent from purchasing your insurance
[1:56:31.900 --> 1:56:34.780]  and you know buying insurance and having insurance is not the same thing as
[1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:37.500]  having healthcare those are very different things
[1:56:37.500 --> 1:56:40.940]  they don't always work that way but they are transferring our money
[1:56:40.940 --> 1:56:44.620]  by a holding a gun to our head to force us to do these things so
[1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:48.060]  here you've got a president who could care less
[1:56:48.060 --> 1:56:52.620]  what the people say in the election if the congress the majority congress of
[1:56:52.620 --> 1:56:55.740]  the people just elected if they don't do what he wants to have done he says well
[1:56:55.740 --> 1:56:58.380]  you know i'm just tired of waiting for you to enact my agenda
[1:56:58.380 --> 1:57:01.420]  i'm going to do it myself but i want to go back to these
[1:57:01.420 --> 1:57:04.300]  ex-police officers or current police officers who are holding on the phone
[1:57:04.300 --> 1:57:07.820]  let's go to uh chris inovada chris
[1:57:07.820 --> 1:57:11.500]  hi david thanks for having me oh thank you for coming go ahead hopefully we can
[1:57:11.500 --> 1:57:16.220]  hopefully we can wrap this up i'll give you uh how agencies have been
[1:57:16.220 --> 1:57:20.620]  dealing with the quota issue um they don't call it a quota
[1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:24.380]  um there's really no such thing however they do it through policy and
[1:57:24.380 --> 1:57:28.940]  procedure a lot of agencies that are accredited do it through that because
[1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:33.500]  this khalia is the uh um the commission on accreditation of law
[1:57:33.500 --> 1:57:37.500]  enforcement and that's um related to the police
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:44.940]  executive research form which is the the governmental type
[1:57:45.900 --> 1:57:48.940]  so you're saying that they call it a policy and like in new york city for
[1:57:48.940 --> 1:57:52.780]  example their policy was what they called the broken window policy if you go
[1:57:52.780 --> 1:57:55.020]  into a neighborhood where there's a lot of broken windows
[1:57:55.020 --> 1:57:58.060]  we're going to really scrutinize the people there and as they pointed out
[1:57:58.060 --> 1:58:00.700]  and the gothamists when they were talking about this work slow down they
[1:58:00.700 --> 1:58:04.300]  said tamping down on all forms of quote disorder things like
[1:58:04.300 --> 1:58:08.220]  resting a foot on a subway seat or biking through a stop sign and they
[1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:12.620]  say that's not cheap it cost them about 1.3 million dollars a day to
[1:58:12.620 --> 1:58:17.260]  process 648 misdemeanor arrests and guess what when they get rough with people
[1:58:17.260 --> 1:58:21.020]  in new york they've had nearly half a billion dollars worth of lawsuits
[1:58:21.020 --> 1:58:25.340]  since 2009 so it has real dollar and sense
[1:58:25.340 --> 1:58:28.380]  consequences it may not even be simply about the money
[1:58:28.380 --> 1:58:32.780]  it may simply be about government strong arming the citizens into
[1:58:32.780 --> 1:58:35.100]  submission stay with us we're going to have more of your calls right after
[1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:37.420]  break

[2:00:25.340 --> 2:00:28.380]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we're taking your calls in
[2:00:28.380 --> 2:00:31.660]  the last segment we were talking to chris from nevada
[2:00:31.660 --> 2:00:36.460]  the next policeman he was talking to us about these policies that
[2:00:36.460 --> 2:00:39.180]  for all intents and purposes he pointed out they're not they don't call them
[2:00:39.180 --> 2:00:42.540]  quotas they call them uh policies and and different
[2:00:42.540 --> 2:00:45.500]  procedures they have a different name for they don't want to call it a quota but
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:48.860]  a quota by any other i think it's still a quota i want to go back to chris because
[2:00:48.860 --> 2:00:51.020]  i kind of cut them off and start talking about the
[2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:55.660]  the way they do enforce the policy they call broken windows in new york city
[2:00:55.660 --> 2:00:59.420]  which essentially works out to in many respects being a quota
[2:00:59.420 --> 2:01:02.460]  they talk to them about the number of arrests that they want to they want to
[2:01:02.460 --> 2:01:05.260]  see this coming up they don't think that they're on their job so
[2:01:05.260 --> 2:01:09.740]  that implies that they want to see more actually in the case of
[2:01:09.740 --> 2:01:14.300]  adrian schoolcraft chris they were pretty explicit with the types of
[2:01:14.300 --> 2:01:18.140]  numbers that they wanted to see for a very specific specific types of crimes
[2:01:18.140 --> 2:01:21.020]  they say i want to see this many of that type and that many of that type they
[2:01:21.020 --> 2:01:24.700]  didn't call them a quota but they had very direct numbers
[2:01:24.700 --> 2:01:28.860]  yeah because they're typical politicians and they should be fired
[2:01:28.860 --> 2:01:33.740]  but i'll explain how it works to you every month the computer generates a
[2:01:33.740 --> 2:01:36.140]  stat list of all your officers on your squad
[2:01:36.140 --> 2:01:41.180]  i was a supervisor so you look on there and if there's people
[2:01:41.180 --> 2:01:45.980]  that are below the average um you go talk to that officer
[2:01:45.980 --> 2:01:48.540]  and initially say hey you need to bring up your stats because they're low
[2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:52.940]  compared to everyone else uh next month if that continues you bring them in
[2:01:52.940 --> 2:01:56.060]  and you have a conversation and you document it in writing and say hey
[2:01:56.060 --> 2:01:59.580]  you need to pick up your stats if that continues for three
[2:01:59.580 --> 2:02:04.140]  the next three months you after writing not writing them up but having a
[2:02:04.140 --> 2:02:06.860]  written verbal conversation that's in their file
[2:02:06.860 --> 2:02:11.100]  so you have documentation to continue the progressive discipline process
[2:02:11.100 --> 2:02:14.300]  so after three months if they haven't picked up the pace and
[2:02:14.300 --> 2:02:18.380]  written more tickets or made more car stops whatever you know the
[2:02:18.380 --> 2:02:22.860]  area that's low um you then put them on what's called a performance plan
[2:02:22.860 --> 2:02:25.980]  and then you meet with them weekly or bi-weekly and
[2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:29.900]  say what are you doing and you give them training and try to get them up to a
[2:02:29.900 --> 2:02:35.180]  standard and then if they don't comply then that's when progressive discipline
[2:02:35.180 --> 2:02:38.300]  comes in to give them written you give them hours and eventually that could
[2:02:38.300 --> 2:02:42.860]  lead to beat to to their dismissal so you see how they go through policy and
[2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:48.060]  procedure to make you work but uh in in the sense of departments
[2:02:48.060 --> 2:02:53.260]  that have this type of policy um you have to get on officer sometimes to go do
[2:02:53.260 --> 2:02:57.180]  work um especially in these times you know you have lazy officers not all cops
[2:02:57.180 --> 2:03:02.140]  or you understand let me ask you this chris good employees let me ask you this
[2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:05.180]  you're looking at an average uh through the police department and you say okay
[2:03:05.180 --> 2:03:08.060]  this guy's not writing nearly as many speeding tickets as these other guys
[2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:11.820]  so maybe the presumption is that this guy's maybe not working as hard or
[2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:15.900]  he's not looking as hard is it possible that maybe
[2:03:15.900 --> 2:03:19.740]  the particular types of crimes are not there or maybe the other people are
[2:03:19.740 --> 2:03:23.180]  over enforcing i mean is that ever a consideration how do they establish this
[2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:26.220]  baseline other than an average does that seem like a reasonable
[2:03:26.220 --> 2:03:29.180]  way to approach this for you because it seems to me
[2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:32.700]  like it might be that you've got the average being pulled up by overly
[2:03:32.700 --> 2:03:35.660]  aggressive officers who know they're going to be rewarded for that kind of
[2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:39.740]  behavior uh you've also got the possibility that these
[2:03:39.740 --> 2:03:43.740]  crimes if they are crimes are not being uniformly distributed uh across the
[2:03:43.740 --> 2:03:46.860]  geographic area where these people patrol
[2:03:46.860 --> 2:03:50.700]  first line supervisor know his people and you have different talents with
[2:03:50.700 --> 2:03:53.740]  different officers some are good at writing tickets some are good at
[2:03:53.740 --> 2:03:57.660]  getting the arrests and finding criminals so unfortunately
[2:03:57.660 --> 2:04:02.700]  the the first line supervisor is not allowed to do their job in most
[2:04:02.700 --> 2:04:06.300]  departments because they're lieutenant or they're captains are looking at that
[2:04:06.300 --> 2:04:09.900]  saying what's going on and you know that officer's doing more arrests because
[2:04:09.900 --> 2:04:13.580]  better work he takes more reports and the workflow is the
[2:04:13.580 --> 2:04:18.140]  trivia squad because it has different talents and so now the boss is going to
[2:04:18.140 --> 2:04:21.820]  be the right this guy you know have a talk with him because he doesn't have
[2:04:21.820 --> 2:04:25.900]  any cars yet he has a lot of reports or he has a lot of arrests
[2:04:25.900 --> 2:04:30.940]  and the uh the higher ups are taking power away from first
[2:04:30.940 --> 2:04:35.260]  visors to do their job of I understand yeah and
[2:04:35.260 --> 2:04:39.100]  we're out of time for this segment uh thanks for calling uh Chris yeah I I
[2:04:39.100 --> 2:04:43.740]  think the problem is I think the kind of misdemeanor crimes that we're seeing I
[2:04:43.740 --> 2:04:46.860]  think it's a symptom of an unaccountable police
[2:04:46.860 --> 2:04:50.540]  force that essentially has a different agenda than what the public thinks the
[2:04:50.540 --> 2:04:54.140]  police are for coming up in the next segment we're going to take your calls
[2:04:54.140 --> 2:04:57.740]  on vaccine experiments uh or experiences rather

[2:08:29.260 --> 2:08:33.260]  this half hour i'm particularly interested in people who have had
[2:08:33.260 --> 2:08:37.260]  uh experiences adverse experiences with vaccines in their
[2:08:37.260 --> 2:08:40.220]  family or personally uh in this half hour we're going to
[2:08:40.220 --> 2:08:43.500]  continue taking a couple more of the callers who are on the line who called
[2:08:43.500 --> 2:08:45.820]  in about the topic we were talking about last
[2:08:45.820 --> 2:08:50.540]  hour and that of course was the uh what we call quota systems we just had an
[2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:54.780]  officer explain to us that they officially don't use that word but
[2:08:54.780 --> 2:08:59.260]  they do put pressure on uh officers and we know from the
[2:08:59.260 --> 2:09:02.460]  tapes of agent schoolcraft in the new york police department
[2:09:02.460 --> 2:09:06.460]  that it was very explicit about how many they wanted to see
[2:09:06.460 --> 2:09:12.060]  arrested per officer for various classes of offenses and these are not
[2:09:12.060 --> 2:09:15.980]  uh violent offenses that we think the police are there to help us for this
[2:09:15.980 --> 2:09:19.260]  is simply harassing people for misdemeanors that they can
[2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:23.100]  generate revenue for the city for that's why new york police department
[2:09:23.100 --> 2:09:28.140]  had a work stoppage a work slowdown to punish the city they know
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:31.980]  that they're essentially meter maids with the ability to bludgeon people on
[2:09:31.980 --> 2:09:36.300]  the street if they don't uh they don't like what's happening
[2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:40.060]  i want to continue with some of these calls uh before we do
[2:09:40.060 --> 2:09:42.940]  of course alex has talked about this earlier in the show this article is up
[2:09:42.940 --> 2:09:48.140]  on info wars dot com about DARPA developing a matrix like brain implant
[2:09:48.140 --> 2:09:51.820]  that's powered from the spine just like out of the movie
[2:09:51.820 --> 2:09:56.060]  just like out of matrix and of course this is something that's going to allow
[2:09:56.060 --> 2:10:01.500]  people to bypass the uh eyes and go directly transmit images directly to
[2:10:01.500 --> 2:10:06.220]  the brain as a replacement for things like
[2:10:06.220 --> 2:10:09.980]  oculus rift now if you've ever used oculus rift and we
[2:10:09.980 --> 2:10:13.420]  passed one around here in the office joe bigs brought one in it's pretty amazing
[2:10:13.420 --> 2:10:17.420]  it's an amazing experience and it's a pretty you can even see the raster
[2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:20.860]  scan lines on the display and yet it is an
[2:10:20.860 --> 2:10:24.220]  amazing immersive experience so you can imagine
[2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:28.460]  that people would willingly take this matrix implant
[2:10:28.460 --> 2:10:31.980]  if they could be entertained because that's really what our
[2:10:31.980 --> 2:10:35.820]  our uh society has boiled down to people who want to be entertained who want to
[2:10:35.820 --> 2:10:38.620]  be comfortable that's about all they care about
[2:10:38.620 --> 2:10:41.740]  but of course i'm very concerned whenever i see DARPA getting involved in
[2:10:41.740 --> 2:10:44.380]  things even the report that we had earlier this week about the special
[2:10:44.380 --> 2:10:47.100]  contact lenses that they were developing for people with
[2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:52.060]  age-related macular degeneration losing your vision at the center
[2:10:52.060 --> 2:10:55.900]  helping them to magnify the vision that they could
[2:10:55.900 --> 2:10:59.420]  wink their eye and cause this thing to go into telescopic mode
[2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:04.140]  and magnify it by a large factor so they could actually
[2:11:04.140 --> 2:11:07.260]  read the print now of course they could only wear these things for 30 minutes
[2:11:07.260 --> 2:11:10.300]  because it totally cuts off the oxygen to your eye
[2:11:10.300 --> 2:11:13.980]  but guess who funded them DARPA because DARPA wants
[2:11:13.980 --> 2:11:18.060]  super contact telescopic vision for its troops
[2:11:18.060 --> 2:11:23.740]  it seems like eisenhower's prediction about the military industrial complex
[2:11:23.740 --> 2:11:29.580]  not only driving wars driving perpetual war perpetual conflict
[2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:33.580]  force profit center but also taking overall research it seems like
[2:11:33.580 --> 2:11:36.940]  that has come to a complete fulfillment because it's not
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:40.460]  just DARPA i don't know if you know this or not but there's
[2:11:40.460 --> 2:11:44.540]  an intelligence advanced research project agency
[2:11:44.540 --> 2:11:48.220]  our iARPA i guess is what they call it but it's not DARPA defense
[2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:51.580]  it's iARPA they're totally about intelligence what type of stuff are
[2:11:51.580 --> 2:11:55.740]  they working on well here's a paper that just came out
[2:11:55.740 --> 2:12:00.540]  in the middle of december forecasting significant societal events
[2:12:00.540 --> 2:12:05.180]  using the embers streaming predictive analytics system
[2:12:05.180 --> 2:12:10.220]  what is embers embers is early model based event recognition using surrogates
[2:12:10.220 --> 2:12:13.500]  all right they love their acronyms what is it really
[2:12:13.500 --> 2:12:16.780]  it's an anticipatory intelligence system to forecast
[2:12:16.780 --> 2:12:20.780]  socially significant population level events things like
[2:12:20.780 --> 2:12:25.340]  civil unrest incidents disease outbreaks election
[2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:31.340]  outcomes election outcomes based on publicly available data who's the
[2:12:31.340 --> 2:12:35.100]  who's the customer of this well that would be for national security
[2:12:35.100 --> 2:12:38.220]  law enforcement intelligence missions because they want to know
[2:12:38.220 --> 2:12:41.820]  and control elections they want to know about
[2:12:41.820 --> 2:12:45.260]  disease outbreaks especially perhaps they're the ones
[2:12:45.260 --> 2:12:50.620]  who are starting it we've seen a lot of interest lately from DARPA from iARPA
[2:12:50.620 --> 2:12:55.660]  in terms of tracking the spread of disease we've seen experiments conducted
[2:12:55.660 --> 2:12:59.340]  in the new york city subways we've also seen them
[2:12:59.340 --> 2:13:05.900]  moving to set up a competition to track the progress of chicken gunia disease
[2:13:05.900 --> 2:13:10.860]  it was a fever that came out of africa so this is something that
[2:13:10.860 --> 2:13:13.980]  over and over again as we look through this paper they're talking about
[2:13:13.980 --> 2:13:17.740]  illness flu like illness counts rare disease outbreaks again
[2:13:17.740 --> 2:13:21.260]  mentioning elections and domestic political crises what they're doing
[2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:26.060]  is they're using open source data in other words publicly available data
[2:13:26.060 --> 2:13:30.220]  they want to mine that information they want to be able to
[2:13:30.220 --> 2:13:33.020]  predict and understand what you're doing and of course this is what we've been
[2:13:33.020 --> 2:13:36.540]  saying for a very long time alex has been talking about this for years we've
[2:13:36.540 --> 2:13:40.460]  all been talking about this is how they're going to use
[2:13:40.460 --> 2:13:44.140]  the data that the NSA is collecting on people it's not just that they're a
[2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:48.300]  bunch of creepy lawyers that's not why they're looking at your social media
[2:13:48.300 --> 2:13:51.740]  they're looking at your social media because they want to predict and
[2:13:51.740 --> 2:13:54.860]  control you they're not on they're closing that loop
[2:13:54.860 --> 2:14:00.300]  they're looking at the effects of how they can put in fake social media trolls
[2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:03.980]  on youtube or on people's facebook accounts to try to move public
[2:14:03.980 --> 2:14:06.460]  opinions so they want to be able to measure it they want to be able to
[2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:09.980]  predict it and as i point out anticipatory intelligence this is the
[2:14:09.980 --> 2:14:13.980]  opening statement anticipatory intelligence is considered to be
[2:14:13.980 --> 2:14:17.900]  one of the next frontiers of big data research that's why
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:21.420]  the NSA why the government is is collecting all of this information and
[2:14:21.420 --> 2:14:24.060]  of course as obama it was not even a week ago
[2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:28.300]  that he did syspa by executive order intelligence sharing
[2:14:28.300 --> 2:14:31.740]  cyber intelligence sharing and of course syspa was rejected twice through the
[2:14:31.740 --> 2:14:35.340]  legislative process but obama's corporate sponsors
[2:14:35.340 --> 2:14:38.380]  and the corporate sponsors of the republican and democrat leadership
[2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:40.780]  want to see this happen so it's going to happen and if they can't get it
[2:14:40.780 --> 2:14:43.660]  through congress they're going to push it through by executive order
[2:14:43.660 --> 2:14:47.500]  who is this information going to be shared with they said it's going to go to
[2:14:47.500 --> 2:14:51.100]  homeland security because if they gave it to the NSA
[2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:54.620]  people would be concerned about their privacy what a joke
[2:14:54.620 --> 2:14:58.220]  we're not concerned about our privacy if it's turned over to homeland security
[2:14:58.220 --> 2:15:02.540]  the entire federal government is set up as a panoptagon
[2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:07.420]  tyranny and they're putting all the places all the pieces into place and
[2:15:07.420 --> 2:15:09.980]  that's another aspect of it the people really
[2:15:09.980 --> 2:15:13.260]  haven't talked about and that is we even have an intelligence advanced
[2:15:13.260 --> 2:15:16.860]  research project i want to go back to some of the people who are
[2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:20.460]  holding to talk we've got nick and michigan
[2:15:20.460 --> 2:15:24.140]  ex marine also call in if you've got anything you'd like to tell us about
[2:15:24.140 --> 2:15:27.740]  your experiences with vaccines go ahead nick
[2:15:27.740 --> 2:15:33.100]  yes uh my my experience i i was in the marine corps i joined the marine corps
[2:15:33.100 --> 2:15:37.820]  in 2008 and or 2005 never had
[2:15:37.820 --> 2:15:41.420]  really a horrible flu ever in my life and
[2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:45.420]  was forced into the vaccination program in the military you know you
[2:15:45.420 --> 2:15:48.540]  stand in the line getting your however many
[2:15:48.540 --> 2:15:53.180]  12 vaccines or whatever and my whole my whole unit there was like
[2:15:53.180 --> 2:15:56.940]  probably 30 or 35 guys that were including me that were
[2:15:56.940 --> 2:16:01.820]  bedridden right after we got our vaccine and it happened
[2:16:01.820 --> 2:16:05.500]  the first time i got my vaccines and it happened the second time i got my
[2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:09.900]  vaccines and the third time fortunately i was in iraq and i
[2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:13.820]  don't even remember how i got out of doing it but i didn't get the flu
[2:16:13.820 --> 2:16:19.100]  so and the other thing is uh i have a my younger brother
[2:16:19.100 --> 2:16:24.220]  he's uh i mean this kid is the he's a state champion quarterback
[2:16:24.220 --> 2:16:29.260]  football player uh excellent health but when he's a baby he had cancer
[2:16:29.260 --> 2:16:34.380]  and he's trying to go into the army special forces in the army my oldest
[2:16:34.380 --> 2:16:39.420]  brother is a marine connoisseur and uh the army
[2:16:39.420 --> 2:16:45.900]  won't let him in and i think it is because he's not a good test subject
[2:16:45.900 --> 2:16:49.980]  for them because he had cancer and they already know that once he
[2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:53.660]  goes in once they start pumping the vaccines to him
[2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:56.700]  there's a pretty good chance that he's going to get cancer again he's went
[2:16:56.700 --> 2:17:00.860]  through chemo and radiation um i'm pretty sure that that's the
[2:17:00.860 --> 2:17:03.820]  reason that they're not going to let him in he's trying to get waivers from
[2:17:03.820 --> 2:17:05.980]  doctors saying that he isn't complete
[2:17:05.980 --> 2:17:09.580]  100 perfect health you know he's never even had a
[2:17:09.580 --> 2:17:14.540]  broken bone but and if anybody's going to join the military for special forces
[2:17:14.540 --> 2:17:18.060]  it's a kid like him you know that's very true you know what you're talking
[2:17:18.060 --> 2:17:22.060]  about in terms of using the military as guinea pigs
[2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:26.140]  doing thanks to them without their consent uh that we talked to Joyce Riley
[2:17:26.140 --> 2:17:29.260]  the power hour earlier this week and she was talking about how and when she was
[2:17:29.260 --> 2:17:32.540]  in the military on one day they gave her
[2:17:32.540 --> 2:17:37.260]  10 different vaccines on one day and it made her very sick and so
[2:17:37.260 --> 2:17:41.820]  we know that they're using the military as uh as test cases and she pointed out
[2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:43.980]  you know of course the Tuskegee experiments they were
[2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:49.100]  done at a VA hospital uh we see what they did with the pleated uranium they
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:53.660]  really don't have much respect for the military that they
[2:17:53.660 --> 2:17:57.500]  send out to fight the wars and they they do in fact use them as guinea pigs so
[2:17:57.500 --> 2:18:02.460]  sorry to hear about your experience uh let's go to Ray in Florida right
[2:18:02.460 --> 2:18:06.700]  hey David how you doing no fine excellent um
[2:18:06.700 --> 2:18:10.620]  just gave you a little bit of a background I did professional
[2:18:10.620 --> 2:18:14.860]  uh well amateur rather at MMA bout I think I had three of them
[2:18:14.860 --> 2:18:18.860]  uh had my nose broken several times I used to train with guys that were
[2:18:18.860 --> 2:18:24.220]  265 pounds when I was 165 pounds anyway I was working construction recently and
[2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:29.340]  stepped on a nail went into the doctor's office and had to get
[2:18:29.340 --> 2:18:33.340]  a uh a tennis shot but they didn't have a you know I guess it's a detap
[2:18:33.340 --> 2:18:37.500]  I believe it's it's all together yes so they gave me the detap shot in my
[2:18:37.500 --> 2:18:40.460]  shoulder uh felt it go down my arm off the
[2:18:40.460 --> 2:18:44.060]  side of my neck and when it hit my brain it knocked me the hell out
[2:18:44.060 --> 2:18:49.260]  I have never been hit as hard as when I took that shot
[2:18:49.260 --> 2:18:54.940]  wow wow so I mean I I was sitting in the chair
[2:18:54.940 --> 2:18:58.940]  I felt it go down my arm up the side of my neck you know I stood up
[2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:03.900]  it went it might have had something to do with me standing up too but I doubt it
[2:19:03.900 --> 2:19:07.820]  because I've taken shots before and it really didn't bother me like that but
[2:19:07.820 --> 2:19:13.420]  to give that detap shot to a small child would be the equivalent of taking him
[2:19:13.420 --> 2:19:17.820]  into that doctor's office and giving him a left
[2:19:17.820 --> 2:19:21.580]  by Mike Tyson back when he was still on d-ball you know what I mean oh yeah oh
[2:19:21.580 --> 2:19:26.060]  yeah yeah it's the thing that bothers me about all this is that
[2:19:26.060 --> 2:19:30.140]  we see people on the vaccine side pushing back against us and
[2:19:30.140 --> 2:19:33.820]  giving us the history of vaccines and the medical history of how they made this
[2:19:33.820 --> 2:19:37.500]  discovery what antibodies aren't anything you know what I understand that
[2:19:37.500 --> 2:19:40.860]  I know all about active immunity I don't know all about passive immunity we
[2:19:40.860 --> 2:19:43.740]  talked about that with the bowl and people getting convalescent blood
[2:19:43.740 --> 2:19:46.940]  serum it's not about that it's about the
[2:19:46.940 --> 2:19:49.900]  preservatives the adjuvants that they put in to
[2:19:49.900 --> 2:19:53.580]  annoy your immune system to trigger your immune system it's about the
[2:19:53.580 --> 2:19:56.140]  additives it's not about the vaccine theory even

[2:24:25.660 --> 2:24:30.060]  good good yeah my daughter uh was vaccine injured
[2:24:30.060 --> 2:24:34.460]  when she was uh you know i don't even know which one it was but
[2:24:34.460 --> 2:24:38.780]  at 10 years old she was diagnosed with staring seizures
[2:24:38.780 --> 2:24:43.020]  uh and they said she was probably having
[2:24:43.020 --> 2:24:48.620]  uh up to 300 a day she you know we had had her tested for add and all that
[2:24:48.620 --> 2:24:52.940]  stuff and you know she was borderline they they wanted to put her on drugs
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:55.980]  and you know for other stuff and we didn't know
[2:24:55.980 --> 2:24:58.540]  enough and at the time we let him put her on
[2:24:58.540 --> 2:25:04.540]  anti-seizure medications and uh she blew up like a balloon she had all the
[2:25:04.540 --> 2:25:08.540]  the symptoms i mean all the you know the the insert
[2:25:08.540 --> 2:25:15.100]  uh just it was a nightmare and for for about
[2:25:15.100 --> 2:25:22.460]  well till she was uh she's 23 now and we got her on young jevity and uh
[2:25:22.460 --> 2:25:26.140]  she's got her own business now and she doesn't have seizures anymore she's
[2:25:26.140 --> 2:25:29.500]  off all her medications and uh she's doing awesome
[2:25:29.500 --> 2:25:32.700]  that's great that's good to hear you know actually i saw one of these videos
[2:25:32.700 --> 2:25:35.340]  where they're trying to lecture us you know why vaccines work and they're
[2:25:35.340 --> 2:25:38.140]  going to give you the basic idea that you know to come in and your body creates
[2:25:38.140 --> 2:25:42.140]  antibodies that's where the active immunity thing but they started out
[2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:46.860]  talking about how they learned that vitamin c would stop scurvy they didn't
[2:25:46.860 --> 2:25:50.780]  really understand the principle of it it got neutralized because they were
[2:25:50.780 --> 2:25:53.260]  storing it in copper pots and so they stopped
[2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:57.420]  doing it and then it came back but they were talking about the efficacy of
[2:25:57.420 --> 2:26:00.540]  supplements and then they went on to vaccines it's like well wait a minute
[2:26:00.540 --> 2:26:04.460]  time out just as copper pots might destroy the
[2:26:04.460 --> 2:26:09.180]  the uh acerbic acid uh the vaccines are something that's
[2:26:09.180 --> 2:26:12.380]  very different than just simple active immunity it's the things that they've
[2:26:12.380 --> 2:26:16.220]  added to it that make it a totally different creature uh so how was your
[2:26:16.220 --> 2:26:20.220]  daughter now was it you said it was a staring syndrome was it autism or has
[2:26:20.220 --> 2:26:23.340]  she recovered now you said with uh uh young jevity
[2:26:23.340 --> 2:26:27.260]  yeah they said it was epilepsy uh you know when she was 10
[2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:32.060]  and she had we they we put her in a hospital for a
[2:26:32.060 --> 2:26:35.900]  test you know they wanted to do a one week eeg
[2:26:35.900 --> 2:26:40.540]  and monitor her and while on her meds she had
[2:26:40.540 --> 2:26:44.940]  you know over a hundred seizures while hooked up to this thing and
[2:26:44.940 --> 2:26:48.300]  then they put her on this stuff i don't even know what it was but it made her
[2:26:48.300 --> 2:26:51.660]  meaner a junkyard dog we said you got to get her off this stuff and
[2:26:51.660 --> 2:26:55.260]  so then we finally heard doc wallick on alex jones and
[2:26:55.260 --> 2:26:59.340]  and it was like oh my god unbelievable uh so we
[2:26:59.340 --> 2:27:02.620]  we set her up and uh she's been on supplements since
[2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:06.220]  uh well she had a baby while on medication
[2:27:06.220 --> 2:27:10.220]  and the baby is fine he hasn't been vaccinated he's two now
[2:27:10.220 --> 2:27:14.860]  he hasn't been sick a day in his life uh he takes young jevity since he was two
[2:27:14.860 --> 2:27:18.860]  months old and it's it's just amazing well they don't put
[2:27:18.860 --> 2:27:22.060]  much they don't put much emphasis as dr wallick and others have pointed out
[2:27:22.060 --> 2:27:27.340]  they don't put much emphasis in medical schools on nutrition and yet
[2:27:27.340 --> 2:27:31.260]  originally uh the the greek doctors are saying let food be your medicine
[2:27:31.260 --> 2:27:35.420]  you have to have nutrition you have to have the basic fuel that your body was
[2:27:35.420 --> 2:27:39.740]  designed to run off of and so many of these diseases that we see
[2:27:39.740 --> 2:27:45.340]  are simply like scurvy uh an example of malnutrition something that is missing
[2:27:45.340 --> 2:27:49.340]  in your diet and so that's why we have these supplements because not only
[2:27:49.340 --> 2:27:53.100]  are we missing a lot of stuff in our diet but they're adding a lot of very
[2:27:53.100 --> 2:27:58.780]  harmful things to our basic food that uh uh we have to have uh
[2:27:58.780 --> 2:28:02.540]  have to be able to deal with when you look at the uh rates of autism in the
[2:28:02.540 --> 2:28:06.540]  amish community uh 10 years ago there was a reporter who
[2:28:06.540 --> 2:28:10.540]  went to the amish community based on the prevalence of autism at the time
[2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:15.020]  and the size of the community uh it was about 150 per uh
[2:28:15.020 --> 2:28:18.140]  i don't know what i forget what it was 150 less say per thousand or whatever
[2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:22.620]  the maybe 10 000 anyway based on the size of the the rate of
[2:28:22.620 --> 2:28:25.340]  autism at the time 10 years ago he expected to see
[2:28:25.340 --> 2:28:29.820]  130 people with autism kids with autism instead he saw three
[2:28:29.820 --> 2:28:33.500]  he didn't know about one of them but two of them it was directly traced
[2:28:33.500 --> 2:28:37.180]  immediately happened after they had their vaccines but there's so many things in
[2:28:37.180 --> 2:28:40.300]  the amish community they're getting whole food they're getting exercise
[2:28:40.300 --> 2:28:44.300]  and they're not getting the kind of chemical soup that we have to deal with
[2:28:44.300 --> 2:28:47.340]  that's a very important point thank you for uh bringing that up david michigan
[2:28:47.340 --> 2:28:50.940]  let's go to nicole in michigan nicole
[2:28:50.940 --> 2:28:53.820]  hi david can you hear me okay yes go ahead
[2:28:53.820 --> 2:28:56.780]  got about a minute i wanted to call in with i wanted to call in with my
[2:28:56.780 --> 2:28:59.980]  husband's story he is um a disabled veteran from the
[2:28:59.980 --> 2:29:03.980]  air force and he was given a vaccine um
[2:29:03.980 --> 2:29:08.460]  about 10 years ago which caused him to immediately well about within 20 minutes
[2:29:08.460 --> 2:29:11.580]  of the vaccine he went into anaphylactic shock
[2:29:11.580 --> 2:29:15.740]  and um over the next 18 months post vaccine
[2:29:15.740 --> 2:29:19.100]  his body would randomly go into anaphylactic shock
[2:29:19.100 --> 2:29:22.540]  um just out of the blue um and we i think we lost count around
[2:29:22.540 --> 2:29:26.140]  somewhere around 30 or 35 times and and 18 months
[2:29:26.140 --> 2:29:30.140]  and um oh how was he now did he recover

[2:33:26.060 --> 2:33:30.860]  now there is a massive push across the world
[2:33:30.860 --> 2:33:35.980]  a huge pr campaign to arrest people that don't vaccinate their children
[2:33:35.980 --> 2:33:40.220]  to forcibly inoculate to not let people travel
[2:33:40.220 --> 2:33:46.540]  to publish the names and addresses of people that don't vaccinate as if
[2:33:46.540 --> 2:33:50.780]  they're pedophiles or something this is a huge push and this is happening
[2:33:50.780 --> 2:33:55.740]  right now because merc whistleblowers and head cdc
[2:33:55.740 --> 2:33:59.660]  doctors and others are going public and saying
[2:33:59.660 --> 2:34:03.580]  the vaccines are linked to autism we covered it up
[2:34:03.580 --> 2:34:06.860]  and so you're seeing a huge push now saying measles measles
[2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:10.060]  you know everybody's going to die take vaccines they're safe and effective no
[2:34:10.060 --> 2:34:14.220]  side effects no problems arrest whoever says that they're bad
[2:34:14.220 --> 2:34:17.660]  because this is an establishment meltdown
[2:34:17.660 --> 2:34:21.340]  i recently interviewed doctor wakefield
[2:34:21.340 --> 2:34:28.300]  his partner top doctor when it comes to the stomach and intestines in england
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:31.420]  has been exonerated and given his medical license back
[2:34:31.420 --> 2:34:39.500]  and the court completely censured the british regulators that had
[2:34:39.500 --> 2:34:43.740]  basically lynched wakefield his partner what we're looking at is a
[2:34:43.740 --> 2:34:47.020]  system that is in meltdown right now and they're in meltdown for a number of
[2:34:47.020 --> 2:34:51.980]  reasons you can only sustain a lie a falsehood for so long and now that
[2:34:51.980 --> 2:34:55.820]  dr william thompson senior cdc scientists has come forward
[2:34:55.820 --> 2:35:00.380]  and said that they have known for 13 years that m mr vaccine is causally
[2:35:00.380 --> 2:35:03.820]  associated with autism and they have hidden it from the public
[2:35:03.820 --> 2:35:08.060]  from doctors from public health officials from everybody
[2:35:08.060 --> 2:35:12.140]  they've kept it to an inner circle of people who knew the truth all along
[2:35:12.140 --> 2:35:15.660]  and have allowed millions of children to be put in harm's way
[2:35:15.660 --> 2:35:19.100]  in the interim so you got whistleblowers from the inside the us
[2:35:19.100 --> 2:35:21.260]  coming out and saying these vaccines are dangerous
[2:35:21.260 --> 2:35:24.940]  you've got wakefield who they always say has been discredited you know vaccines
[2:35:24.940 --> 2:35:27.580]  are perfectly safe that research was bogus
[2:35:27.580 --> 2:35:31.420]  that's all a pr hoax so they're doubling and tripling down
[2:35:31.420 --> 2:35:36.060]  with forced inoculations with the claim that it's going to be the law that
[2:35:36.060 --> 2:35:39.980]  you've got to take shots and they're adding hundreds of new vaccines see
[2:35:39.980 --> 2:35:43.980]  30 40 years ago you only got five or six vaccines now it's over 50
[2:35:43.980 --> 2:35:47.820]  they want it to be over a hundred autism's gone from one in 25
[2:35:47.820 --> 2:35:51.900]  thousand 30 years ago to one in less than 60
[2:35:51.900 --> 2:35:55.260]  it's projected by 2025 to be one out of 10
[2:35:55.260 --> 2:35:59.340]  this is the big global crisis this is about medical tyranny now the big
[2:35:59.340 --> 2:36:04.860]  pharma complex is striking back they've doubled and tripled down
[2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:09.100]  we the people need to strike back and everyone
[2:36:09.100 --> 2:36:13.020]  who has been vaccine damaged or whose children have been vaccine damaged
[2:36:13.020 --> 2:36:18.540]  needs to go to youtube and other platforms and do a testimonial video
[2:36:18.540 --> 2:36:21.820]  and i suggest you use your name your information you show pictures of your
[2:36:21.820 --> 2:36:25.580]  children we need to warn others so that they
[2:36:25.580 --> 2:36:29.260]  understand just how dangerous this is because with my uncle that almost got
[2:36:29.260 --> 2:36:32.140]  killed with a tetanus shot they told him yeah the shot did it
[2:36:32.140 --> 2:36:36.940]  the doctors did with marcos morales our live news director
[2:36:36.940 --> 2:36:43.020]  same thing happened to his child and the doctor admitted it to it
[2:36:43.020 --> 2:36:46.140]  but they want to isolate us they want to keep us quiet
[2:36:46.140 --> 2:36:53.100]  they want to arrest us they want to publish our names and shame us
[2:36:53.100 --> 2:36:57.020]  like we're in a sex child registry or something because we're speaking out
[2:36:57.020 --> 2:37:00.300]  against vaccines or don't take vaccines none of my three children have been
[2:37:00.300 --> 2:37:03.500]  vaccinated and it's because i have so many friends and
[2:37:03.500 --> 2:37:08.380]  family who have 10 15 20 year old children that are
[2:37:08.380 --> 2:37:12.700]  still in diapers screaming and yelling in pain every day
[2:37:12.700 --> 2:37:15.980]  with incredible intestinal problems from the vaccines
[2:37:15.980 --> 2:37:21.420]  and there's going to be more and more victims now we've got to not just
[2:37:21.420 --> 2:37:26.140]  sit here quietly while this holocaust goes on this is a do or die moment it's
[2:37:26.140 --> 2:37:29.420]  absolutely crucial in the history of this country and indeed the world
[2:37:29.420 --> 2:37:33.100]  of who prevails who do your children actually belong to
[2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:38.540]  and if we do not get William Thompson before a congressional series of committees
[2:37:38.540 --> 2:37:43.260]  that unearth the precise nature and extent of the fraud at the cdc and how
[2:37:43.260 --> 2:37:46.300]  they that's the big whistleblower that is the big whistleblower
[2:37:46.300 --> 2:37:49.980]  then if we do not do that and if we lose this battle
[2:37:49.980 --> 2:37:54.540]  your children you will be owned by the pharmaceutical industry and your children
[2:37:54.540 --> 2:37:59.020]  and your children's children's slavery and they are simply a marketplace
[2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:03.100]  for those companies they are quantified in terms of vaccination
[2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:06.300]  for every birth in how much revenue they will generate
[2:38:06.300 --> 2:38:09.900]  for the pharmaceutical industry in a mandated program
[2:38:09.900 --> 2:38:14.940]  for which there is no real recourse to any kind of compensational litigation
[2:38:14.940 --> 2:38:18.060]  if your children are harmed so they want to take away your rights
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:20.940]  as to whether your children should be vaccinated or not according to your
[2:38:20.940 --> 2:38:24.540]  decision but if your child is harmed and vaccines are
[2:38:24.540 --> 2:38:27.980]  according to the supreme court unavoidably unsafe
[2:38:27.980 --> 2:38:32.700]  then you are left to pick up the pieces. The inserts are clear that it can give
[2:38:32.700 --> 2:38:39.900]  you diabetes, Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, death, pancreatitis
[2:38:39.900 --> 2:38:43.660]  everything that we know is happening to the children
[2:38:43.660 --> 2:38:48.220]  is all in the insert but the news will never tell you
[2:38:48.220 --> 2:38:51.260]  about these. Now the reason we're doing this special report
[2:38:51.260 --> 2:38:54.940]  is it hit me. I was back in the control room
[2:38:54.940 --> 2:38:58.940]  talking to Marcos Morales and others about the scourge of vaccines
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:01.900]  he was shaking his head and he said yeah I really don't want to talk about this
[2:39:01.900 --> 2:39:05.340]  but but but Darren McBreen says I really should
[2:39:05.340 --> 2:39:10.940]  my first child well he's gonna tell you the story
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:14.860]  got the vaccines they gave her a whole bunch at once
[2:39:14.860 --> 2:39:19.420]  and it was incredibly painful and she got incredibly sick and the doctor
[2:39:19.420 --> 2:39:23.500]  told him oh that's just normal they don't even deny it now
[2:39:23.500 --> 2:39:27.900]  and what's happening is there's brain inflammation IQ is being damaged
[2:39:27.900 --> 2:39:31.260]  and girls are tougher than boys genetically any doctor will tell you
[2:39:31.260 --> 2:39:33.660]  that that's why 80 plus percent of the autistic
[2:39:33.660 --> 2:39:38.540]  children are boys but he has daughters so Marcos is going to tell you a story
[2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:41.420]  because he's reluctant but he says he needs to do it he
[2:39:41.420 --> 2:39:44.620]  wants to do it he's a behind-the-scenes guy
[2:39:44.620 --> 2:39:48.540]  because he wants to warn you to know the facts and to not believe the mainstream
[2:39:48.540 --> 2:39:52.620]  media the Brian Williams types and then I want to challenge everybody out
[2:39:52.620 --> 2:39:56.140]  there again who's been damaged or who's had problems
[2:39:56.140 --> 2:40:00.140]  to tell your story be heard say we're not intimidated by big pharma
[2:40:00.140 --> 2:40:03.500]  and by the pr firms we're standing up we're taking action
[2:40:03.500 --> 2:40:06.780]  and good people inside government and corporations are going public
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:10.140]  and everything that Alex Jones and Wakefield and Dr. Blalock and countless
[2:40:10.140 --> 2:40:13.740]  other people have said it turns out is accurate
[2:40:13.740 --> 2:40:17.260]  I mean even Harvard studies admit that fluorides lowering on accused
[2:40:17.260 --> 2:40:20.940]  but they don't want you to read the fine print ladies and gentlemen
[2:40:20.940 --> 2:40:25.260]  but they legally have to tell you this but when you go get your shots they're
[2:40:25.260 --> 2:40:28.460]  not offering it to you because it comes with the ampule itself
[2:40:28.460 --> 2:40:32.380]  the multi-dose vial so again we're going to launch a whole initiative
[2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:35.980]  and we're going to air some of these on air on the radio and tv shows
[2:40:35.980 --> 2:40:40.780]  so the other people will start a chain reaction of telling their stories
[2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:44.780]  they want to keep this quiet and that's why they know that people are waking up
[2:40:44.780 --> 2:40:48.860]  to them so they're really pushing now that's their answer
[2:40:48.860 --> 2:40:53.180]  to shutting down this this this avalanche of truth that's hitting them
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:40:56.460]  marcos first off you've been here on what three and a half years
[2:40:56.460 --> 2:40:59.180]  about three and a half years yes well you're launch of the nightly news well
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:02.620]  you're a good friend of mine i'm over here you're customarily
[2:41:02.620 --> 2:41:05.900]  ranting but but but how could we not rant knowing this
[2:41:05.900 --> 2:41:09.420]  and seeing this huge push first off what do you make of all the stuff we're
[2:41:09.420 --> 2:41:13.180]  seeing in the media the talk of publishing names arresting people
[2:41:13.180 --> 2:41:17.020]  the bullying the terrorist tactics and then tell us the story
[2:41:17.020 --> 2:41:20.380]  i mean your wife's a nurse tell us the story of your oldest child and
[2:41:20.380 --> 2:41:23.740]  what happened well one of the problems with the
[2:41:23.740 --> 2:41:26.940]  the propaganda in the public these days is that
[2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:30.540]  it's turning a lot of people's minds into into buying into it
[2:41:30.540 --> 2:41:34.700]  i know people who are death deftly against the
[2:41:34.700 --> 2:41:38.300]  the transvaginal ultrasound when they were trying to regulate it
[2:41:38.300 --> 2:41:41.580]  and it's under the guise of i didn't want the government
[2:41:41.580 --> 2:41:45.260]  putting something in my body that i didn't want there
[2:41:45.260 --> 2:41:48.780]  and these same people are for forced vaccinations
[2:41:48.780 --> 2:41:52.060]  and i would tell them you can't take that out of your body you're for the
[2:41:52.060 --> 2:41:55.580]  government putting something in your body when you can't take it out and
[2:41:55.580 --> 2:41:58.300]  this is the government being able to put in our body whatever
[2:41:58.300 --> 2:42:01.660]  they want these so-called vaccines and they've got liability protection i mean
[2:42:01.660 --> 2:42:05.580]  how creepy is that it's creepy and the uh my way to
[2:42:05.580 --> 2:42:08.460]  fight back as you said i'm i'm reluctant to be on camera i'm not a
[2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:11.660]  i'm behind the camera talent usually but but hopefully you'll spur others to
[2:42:11.660 --> 2:42:14.540]  have the courage because we got to stand up for these children my way to fight
[2:42:14.540 --> 2:42:17.660]  back was i would give people in factual information i would give them the
[2:42:17.660 --> 2:42:23.820]  articles with the the studies the data and nothing really rang true with them
[2:42:23.820 --> 2:42:27.580]  unless my personal side came out and then i would say well
[2:42:27.580 --> 2:42:31.020]  you know when my first child came the second time we
[2:42:31.020 --> 2:42:35.900]  we uh visited the doctor we went a little later than our date so
[2:42:35.900 --> 2:42:39.340]  we were gonna the doctor said that we had to put four vaccines in
[2:42:39.340 --> 2:42:42.940]  that day because i missed the other two and i was
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:46.220]  you know it was the first time parent it did no idea what i was doing i didn't
[2:42:46.220 --> 2:42:50.460]  do my homework obviously and so i went along with it
[2:42:50.460 --> 2:42:55.020]  and then that night uh my wife was working over nights at the time so i had
[2:42:55.020 --> 2:43:00.620]  my daughter by myself and she just just out of control just started crying
[2:43:00.620 --> 2:43:05.260]  her eyes were bright red her head was on fire and
[2:43:05.260 --> 2:43:09.100]  she was inconsolable inconsolable for almost three days
[2:43:09.100 --> 2:43:14.220]  and into the first night her fever spiked one oh three seven
[2:43:14.220 --> 2:43:17.740]  one oh four is when you go to the hospital i knew at least that much and i so
[2:43:17.740 --> 2:43:21.980]  i called around then and uh i was told that that it was fine
[2:43:21.980 --> 2:43:25.740]  that it was normal this was a normal reaction so i had to get the doctor on
[2:43:25.740 --> 2:43:28.620]  the phone and tell them this was happening my daughter is
[2:43:28.620 --> 2:43:31.660]  having this adverse reaction the hospital says that's what happens
[2:43:31.660 --> 2:43:35.820]  when you get vaccines and the doctor can yeah no this is a normal reaction
[2:43:35.820 --> 2:43:39.260]  including death and i so i said well if that's a normal reaction
[2:43:39.260 --> 2:43:43.260]  then i'm not doing that ever again to my child she suffered for almost three
[2:43:43.260 --> 2:43:46.220]  days inconsolable to the point where she couldn't cry
[2:43:46.220 --> 2:43:49.900]  anymore she was her tears were dried up her body was
[2:43:49.900 --> 2:43:53.740]  worn out and she just whimpered and laid there and for those that don't know
[2:43:53.740 --> 2:43:57.340]  when adults are given a bunch of shots at once the military
[2:43:57.340 --> 2:43:59.900]  i've talked to troops that have described it when they're given like three or
[2:43:59.900 --> 2:44:03.740]  four shots at once burning uncontrollable
[2:44:03.740 --> 2:44:06.940]  migraine headache and that's why you see these kids
[2:44:06.940 --> 2:44:10.300]  rob do was telling the story in fact i didn't tell i was going to do this somebody
[2:44:10.300 --> 2:44:12.620]  go grab rob bring him in here because we're having these behind the scenes
[2:44:12.620 --> 2:44:15.820]  discussions that are so real they would wake people up
[2:44:15.820 --> 2:44:18.620]  he'll be at the playground and see like some two-year-old flipping out acting
[2:44:18.620 --> 2:44:21.180]  crazy one of his neighbors and they go i don't know what happened she's never
[2:44:21.180 --> 2:44:24.140]  acted like this he's never acted like this and rob goes did you go to the doctor
[2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:27.900]  they're like yeah we went yesterday did you get shots they're like
[2:44:27.900 --> 2:44:31.820]  how did you know because we know and until a few years ago
[2:44:31.820 --> 2:44:35.100]  if your daughter would have had convulsions they would have taken her from
[2:44:35.100 --> 2:44:39.020]  you or if she had died they would have indicted you because they do a cat scan
[2:44:39.020 --> 2:44:42.380]  blood on the brain your daughter your daughter had a huge autoimmune response
[2:44:42.380 --> 2:44:45.500]  i'm not a brain surgeon dr. blalock is and exposes that
[2:44:45.500 --> 2:44:48.380]  right i guess talking to his mic robert i mean tell
[2:44:48.380 --> 2:44:52.220]  it's the new normal now you know your kids is flailing on the playground and
[2:44:52.220 --> 2:44:55.580]  she's kind of laughing about it going oh we don't know what's wrong
[2:44:55.580 --> 2:44:59.020]  and i just go well did y'all just go to the doctor she goes
[2:44:59.020 --> 2:45:02.700]  yeah we we took her last week she just got back from you know she went to the
[2:45:02.700 --> 2:45:06.380]  doctor last week oh okay and i said has she ever
[2:45:06.380 --> 2:45:08.940]  acted like that before no this is the first time she started acting like this
[2:45:08.940 --> 2:45:12.540]  two-year-old baby now you call the rest of stories you asked about vaccines
[2:45:12.540 --> 2:45:16.220]  yeah well and then i said is she getting all of her shots and they're like oh
[2:45:16.220 --> 2:45:19.580]  yeah she's right on schedule so it's the fact that
[2:45:19.580 --> 2:45:23.900]  the parents don't even see the disc the the connection between the bad behavior
[2:45:23.900 --> 2:45:27.340]  because she's never acted like this before she'd just gone to the doctor
[2:45:27.340 --> 2:45:30.780]  and this is what happens i've even i've looked at studies of people that said
[2:45:30.780 --> 2:45:35.420]  the vaccines are safe and in the epilogue the doctor writes i've taken
[2:45:35.420 --> 2:45:39.020]  through my first two kids they both had seizures
[2:45:39.020 --> 2:45:42.300]  after the shot but i'm going to take my third one to get the shot and i'm going
[2:45:42.300 --> 2:45:46.300]  to give them Tylenol beforehand that's their solution here's the because these
[2:45:46.300 --> 2:45:50.620]  aren't vaccines they're adding brain altering systems the
[2:45:50.620 --> 2:45:53.900]  anti stress type vaccines that are viruses
[2:45:53.900 --> 2:45:57.020]  will put the articles up that go in and actually eat part of the brain
[2:45:57.020 --> 2:45:59.980]  this is population control it's what's an eco science and
[2:45:59.980 --> 2:46:04.140]  it's so big that they may win because it's so over the top
[2:46:04.140 --> 2:46:07.740]  how do you deal with this how do you deal with one in 25 000 having autism
[2:46:07.740 --> 2:46:11.500]  30 years ago and now it's one in 50 something how do you deal with the
[2:46:11.500 --> 2:46:16.860]  magnitude of my mother almost died from a flu shot
[2:46:16.860 --> 2:46:21.020]  but they admitted the thing is you said the doctor said this is normal
[2:46:21.020 --> 2:46:23.660]  see that's the new thing because they'll say on the news no side effects no
[2:46:23.660 --> 2:46:26.940]  problem you go hey doctor says they could make me have a convulsions
[2:46:26.940 --> 2:46:31.020]  uh destroy my pancreas and give me diabetes it says it all right here they're
[2:46:31.020 --> 2:46:34.460]  like yeah yeah pneumonia pneumonia is one of the side effects
[2:46:34.460 --> 2:46:37.740]  you know get measles from the measles shop people spreading the measles most
[2:46:37.740 --> 2:46:40.620]  of them have had shots and they'll say in the back of the paper
[2:46:40.620 --> 2:46:44.140]  yeah we don't know why people are getting the flu shot and then dying of the flu
[2:46:44.140 --> 2:46:48.780]  yeah of the same strain that they're supposedly vaccinated against the same
[2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:51.820]  exact strain that they're being injected with they die from
[2:46:51.820 --> 2:46:55.260]  inside warfare the connection i was talking to a globalist off record once
[2:46:55.260 --> 2:47:00.540]  and they said alex you understand you think people adapt and evolve
[2:47:00.540 --> 2:47:03.980]  adapt overcome you know the military talks about
[2:47:03.980 --> 2:47:08.780]  is a good thing we use the public adapting to bad things and people will
[2:47:08.780 --> 2:47:12.780]  will go along with it and he sort of explains me basically laughing at me
[2:47:12.780 --> 2:47:17.180]  uh when i was flying to new york once on first class flight uh to be on the view
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:20.380]  and i mean i looked a guy up he was like the head of a major bank
[2:47:20.380 --> 2:47:24.060]  not one of the big six but one right here below that people don't understand
[2:47:24.060 --> 2:47:28.300]  this is a multi-generational attack this is something that has been going on
[2:47:28.300 --> 2:47:31.980]  for about 60 70 years and they just keep every year
[2:47:31.980 --> 2:47:35.980]  they change the schedule they up the dosage and it's little bits
[2:47:35.980 --> 2:47:39.500]  but we've seen and it's happened really bad since the 80s the late 80s
[2:47:39.500 --> 2:47:43.100]  when rain man came out to normalize autism and make it seem like it's kind
[2:47:43.100 --> 2:47:45.900]  of cool and they normalize breast cancer right yeah it's up three four
[2:47:45.900 --> 2:47:48.220]  thousand percent but we're having a run for it
[2:47:48.220 --> 2:47:51.260]  and we're not going to ask why it's increasing it's up to you folks
[2:47:51.260 --> 2:47:54.620]  rob do can't do it all marcos morales can't do it all alex jones can't do it
[2:47:54.620 --> 2:47:59.260]  all kit daniels can't do it all uh don salazar can't do it all
[2:47:59.260 --> 2:48:03.980]  uh you know all our crew back there john bound uh darren we need you to tell
[2:48:03.980 --> 2:48:08.300]  your story especially about the doctors admitting it
[2:48:08.300 --> 2:48:13.420]  because i mean my dad wouldn't vaccinate me and he's an oral
[2:48:13.420 --> 2:48:16.620]  surgeon and a dentist and you know has a degree in
[2:48:16.620 --> 2:48:20.860]  chemistry and all those stuff and he wouldn't do it because he said they
[2:48:20.860 --> 2:48:23.500]  usually don't protect you even if it's a clean vaccine
[2:48:23.500 --> 2:48:26.780]  and it lowers your immune system he said i would only take it if there was
[2:48:26.780 --> 2:48:29.980]  something super deadly like polio running around and only it was already
[2:48:29.980 --> 2:48:33.660]  rampant but he goes you know your grandmother got polio
[2:48:33.660 --> 2:48:37.740]  from the polio shot so i went and asked her she goes yeah i got it a month
[2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:40.700]  after she was given the shot and then she got
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:43.980]  these strains she'd been vaccinated four months later and is on crutches at age
[2:48:43.980 --> 2:48:49.740]  89 today so so this affects me my mother used to run triathlons this is
[2:48:49.740 --> 2:48:52.700]  like 20 years ago and they told everybody on the team get your flu shot
[2:48:52.700 --> 2:48:54.860]  because we're having a triathlon come up next month
[2:48:54.860 --> 2:48:59.180]  uh you know she was on ut master swimming she was in bed for like two weeks
[2:48:59.180 --> 2:49:05.260]  just just almost killed uh my uncle uh joe joe jones uh almost killed him the
[2:49:05.260 --> 2:49:07.980]  doctor said yeah you had a bad reaction to have this shot face swole up hands
[2:49:07.980 --> 2:49:12.460]  swole up what are they everyone i know i mean
[2:49:12.460 --> 2:49:16.540]  it's ridiculous i haven't had the flu shot myself since high school by the way
[2:49:16.540 --> 2:49:20.140]  and i got the flu every year in high school that i got the flu shot
[2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:23.420]  and then once i moved out went to college never took the flu shot again
[2:49:23.420 --> 2:49:27.340]  i haven't had the flu since i've had you know well the
[2:49:27.340 --> 2:49:33.660]  canadian government study but never it lowers your immunity by 50 for an
[2:49:33.660 --> 2:49:36.780]  entire year when you take the regular flu shot
[2:49:36.780 --> 2:49:40.940]  it's up to you to call in the talk radio with your stories it's up to you
[2:49:40.940 --> 2:49:44.860]  if you don't know how to do a youtube go to your grandson or your neighbor or
[2:49:44.860 --> 2:49:48.540]  or your brother do it speak out the journey of a thousand miles
[2:49:48.540 --> 2:49:52.300]  starts with a single step i started 23 years ago trying to get
[2:49:52.300 --> 2:49:55.260]  on air after three years i got on air now i reach 20 million people a week
[2:49:55.260 --> 2:49:58.140]  conservatively and i just didn't like them trying to pass
[2:49:58.140 --> 2:50:02.140]  laws that under 18 couldn't shoot guns with their parents
[2:50:02.140 --> 2:50:05.020]  couldn't go hunting uh that they were trying to take those private property
[2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:08.300]  i never tended to be on air i never tended to do all this i just
[2:50:08.300 --> 2:50:12.140]  went out there and you can do it too i'm not saying you want to go this far
[2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:16.460]  maybe some of you will go further just tell the story and you know what if
[2:50:16.460 --> 2:50:19.900]  vaccines have been great for you keep it up
[2:50:19.900 --> 2:50:23.580]  just just enjoy yourself but at least read the insert because i'll be in a
[2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:28.140]  restaurant and i will see someone with a air tank on
[2:50:28.140 --> 2:50:31.660]  being wheeled in it looks like they're about to die and they've got people and i
[2:50:31.660 --> 2:50:35.420]  and i saw this woman walk over the other woman she goes hi how you doing blare
[2:50:35.420 --> 2:50:39.020]  that was her name have you got your flu shot she's like yeah
[2:50:39.020 --> 2:50:42.780]  i got the flu shot she's like 50 years old or something so she's about to die
[2:50:42.780 --> 2:50:46.220]  and i i'll be in restaurants it's like a cult now all these really unhealthy
[2:50:46.220 --> 2:50:50.620]  looking people and they're like yeah i'm a shot i'm a shot
[2:50:51.980 --> 2:50:54.060]  i mean it's just they just think they're getting something they're like
[2:50:54.060 --> 2:50:58.460]  Dylan what's right not gonna get other people sick herd immunity herd immunity
[2:50:58.460 --> 2:51:03.500]  herd immunity the government hello is gonna force stuff in us to start a
[2:51:03.500 --> 2:51:06.140]  civil war yeah i've never called for violence and i'm not calling for
[2:51:06.140 --> 2:51:09.820]  violence now but it's violent to force something on people
[2:51:09.820 --> 2:51:12.780]  that we know hurts them in india and africa everywhere else they've caught
[2:51:12.780 --> 2:51:16.060]  the un forcibly inoculating sterilizing people
[2:51:16.060 --> 2:51:19.020]  this is like coming at you with a gun but it soft kills you
[2:51:19.020 --> 2:51:22.860]  okay so i'm not for offensive violence but i'm telling you
[2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:25.980]  they want to start a civil war this is the way it's going to be and the media
[2:51:25.980 --> 2:51:29.100]  people and the bureaucrats and the medical people and the
[2:51:29.100 --> 2:51:33.020]  Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and bill gates up to this to his eyeballs
[2:51:33.020 --> 2:51:36.220]  they're trying to make this forced mcdonald's giving out the free you know
[2:51:36.220 --> 2:51:39.820]  vaccines with happy meals you are going to be held accountable
[2:51:39.820 --> 2:51:42.620]  i know the nazis got caught because they used guns and everybody could see
[2:51:42.620 --> 2:51:45.980]  they were killing people you just give us shots we go off and die later
[2:51:45.980 --> 2:51:50.140]  no we know we're ringing the alarm bell and we know what you're doing and i
[2:51:50.140 --> 2:51:53.820]  just want to say this we're three dads here we all have kids
[2:51:53.820 --> 2:51:57.340]  and it's not that we're medical scientists we're not professionals in the
[2:51:57.340 --> 2:52:01.580]  medical field all we did read the inserts read the studies
[2:52:01.580 --> 2:52:05.340]  read what other people have researched and look at the connections we're not
[2:52:05.340 --> 2:52:08.220]  doing anything spectacular the doctor told you it was the vaccine it was a
[2:52:08.220 --> 2:52:11.180]  normal response and she came back thank god
[2:52:11.180 --> 2:52:15.020]  he was a lucky one absolutely but a boy probably i mean autistic could have been
[2:52:15.020 --> 2:52:18.220]  could have been because boys can't handle it
[2:52:18.220 --> 2:52:22.460]  it's so epic though i mean it's it's so wild it's bio warfare
[2:52:22.460 --> 2:52:26.700]  we're undergoing bio warfare in the name of these giant pharmaceutical
[2:52:26.700 --> 2:52:29.820]  companies to make us customers for life because
[2:52:29.820 --> 2:52:33.020]  when you're debilitated by these you may not have autism you may have severe
[2:52:33.020 --> 2:52:36.460]  allergies you may have crones disease how many people out there have crones
[2:52:36.460 --> 2:52:39.020]  disease who also got their vaccine and they never used to have that no these
[2:52:39.020 --> 2:52:43.100]  new diseases uh pediatric cancer it's all good
[2:52:43.100 --> 2:52:47.100]  it's all in the gut and it's all attack and doctor wakefield with the
[2:52:47.100 --> 2:52:50.060]  top uh gut doctor found that's why they targeted him
[2:52:50.060 --> 2:52:53.980]  because the government already had two studies in england and they already knew
[2:52:53.980 --> 2:52:57.100]  we're trying to cover it up it's criminal he hit on it yeah like it's all
[2:52:57.100 --> 2:53:00.620]  to protect my god watching we have them they're like no mr. Holmes
[2:53:00.620 --> 2:53:03.020]  they have a lot more money and we're going to destroy you that's what they
[2:53:03.020 --> 2:53:05.660]  did well but he's rising like the phoenix he's been
[2:53:05.660 --> 2:53:08.940]  sonorated here here's what you need to do i want to make this a featured video
[2:53:08.940 --> 2:53:12.620]  all right on the youtube channel i want it on info wars prison planet facebook
[2:53:12.620 --> 2:53:15.100]  twitter yeah because it seems like there's something super important it
[2:53:15.100 --> 2:53:19.100]  doesn't get pushed and i want this video to get out there folks
[2:53:19.100 --> 2:53:23.260]  we can do it together tell your testimony expose what's happening
[2:53:23.260 --> 2:53:28.780]  band together uh and let your doctor know what my dad says is

[2:56:26.220 --> 2:56:29.420]  we see this condescension we saw this hysteric
[2:56:29.420 --> 2:56:34.060]  hatred from this woman jennifer hibben white who said that her 15 day old son
[2:56:34.060 --> 2:56:37.740]  was exposed to measles in a waiting room and and he's going to die at any minute
[2:56:37.740 --> 2:56:41.180]  that's the way it was uh she's fighting for his life that was the way it was
[2:56:41.180 --> 2:56:44.780]  put on the daily mail he didn't come down with measles
[2:56:44.780 --> 2:56:49.100]  and the patient who had exposed other people in that waiting room
[2:56:49.100 --> 2:56:52.860]  was a vaccinated person patient zero
[2:56:52.860 --> 2:56:57.500]  was a vaccinated person not the unvaccinated we understand what the
[2:56:57.500 --> 2:57:01.420]  theory of vaccines are about but you also have to understand
[2:57:01.420 --> 2:57:05.020]  it's the same thing as saying that fast food french fries are simply potatoes
[2:57:05.020 --> 2:57:07.660]  they're not they've got preservatives and many
[2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:10.700]  other chemicals in them that allow them as they've done in iceland

[2:57:14.860 --> 2:57:17.980]  where these things do not age they don't change they haven't changed in six
[2:57:17.980 --> 2:57:22.380]  years these french fries so they're not simply potatoes the vaccines
[2:57:22.380 --> 2:57:27.660]  are not simply about active immunity now if you want more information i think
