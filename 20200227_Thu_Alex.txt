[00:00.000 --> 00:20.560]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Thursday edition.
[00:20.560 --> 00:27.880]  I'm Alex Jones, coming to you from Washington, D.C., just a few miles from the area of Maryland
[00:27.880 --> 00:33.520]  where CPAC is happening with five-hour lines of people attempting to get in to see Vice
[00:33.520 --> 00:36.240]  President Pence that is there right now.
[00:36.240 --> 00:43.080]  We have multiple reporter groups and other groups that we sponsor inside of the event,
[00:43.080 --> 00:51.400]  posting articles and videos, exclusive interviews to band.video, infowars.com, newswars.com,
[00:51.400 --> 00:57.640]  nationalfile.com, summit.news, and other great sites that we work with.
[00:57.640 --> 01:03.160]  And I am going to, in an hour, leave, and my schedule will fully take over along with
[01:03.160 --> 01:07.160]  Alan Keyes and others who have done an amazing job.
[01:07.160 --> 01:10.600]  So that's all coming up today.
[01:10.600 --> 01:13.440]  We have huge coronavirus developments.
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.040]  Obviously, it's a man-made weapon that's admitted.
[01:17.040 --> 01:19.400]  There's some larger design behind it.
[01:19.400 --> 01:21.320]  We've pretty much figured that out.
[01:21.320 --> 01:27.600]  We've been on the very vanguard cutting edge of wargaming it with Dr. Francis Boyle in
[01:27.600 --> 01:32.840]  the interview yesterday with Mike Adams, and Mike Adams, of course, is riding shotgun
[01:32.840 --> 01:33.840]  with us from Austin, Texas.
[01:33.840 --> 01:39.600]  But I have an infrastructure story I'm going to break when we come back on the other side.
[01:39.600 --> 01:46.960]  A huge miscarriage of justice, criminal behavior, in my view, unprecedented by this judge, Amy
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.040]  Berman Jackson, and just the brazen attempt of her with the deep state and the corrupt
[01:52.040 --> 01:58.640]  corporate media to try to engage in unbelievable criminal activity in public to set the precedent
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.280]  for a total judicial tyranny will also be exposed.
[02:02.280 --> 02:04.560]  Tyler Nixon is coming up as we speak.
[02:04.560 --> 02:05.560]  He'll be here.
[02:05.560 --> 02:11.400]  Robert Stone's personal lawyer who has a lot of his own personal views on things.
[02:11.400 --> 02:15.680]  We know that Roger gets persecuted for whatever anyone he's associated with says or does,
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.720]  but Tyler Nixon has been very tough and not back down threats to the judge.
[02:19.720 --> 02:20.720]  He is a citizen.
[02:20.720 --> 02:26.080]  There's a lawyer, a respected person, is going to give his views on this tyrannous wrecks
[02:26.080 --> 02:27.080]  that we're dealing with.
[02:27.080 --> 02:30.400]  And, of course, we went and bullhorned her at Point Blank Range just for exposing her
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.400]  crimes.
[02:31.400 --> 02:32.400]  So there's so much coming up today.
[02:32.400 --> 02:38.360]  Also, we're going to have some clips of General Flynn's son came with a great patriot and
[02:38.360 --> 02:43.240]  war veteran to the event who had been brought in from the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[02:43.240 --> 02:47.800]  And we had a very good discussion last night that we're going to be airing coming up parts
[02:47.800 --> 02:51.200]  of in the fourth hour today.
[02:51.200 --> 02:53.440]  That'll be exclusively retransmitted here.
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.440]  It went out on the live streams last night.
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.120]  The large audience, we're going to have HD for you here with General Flynn's son.
[02:59.120 --> 03:02.200]  Another persecuted group is EO8 sentencing.
[03:02.200 --> 03:04.280]  They just leave the sentencing hanging out there.
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.600]  The Justice Department comes to him still, not even under Barr's control and says, just
[03:08.600 --> 03:09.600]  tell us Trump's evil.
[03:09.600 --> 03:12.760]  They'll bring down Trump and we won't put you in jail.
[03:12.760 --> 03:17.520]  So that's the blackmail, the corruption of Flynn is refusing to lie about the president.
[03:17.520 --> 03:20.160]  So you've got all these political prisoners on every side.
[03:20.160 --> 03:22.760]  Mike, I know that you're going to be taking over an hour.
[03:22.760 --> 03:23.760]  You're going to write a shot down with us.
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.320]  But the minute and a half we have before break, tell us some of what's coming up.
[03:27.320 --> 03:33.200]  Well, we've got the CDC now warning us about a possible outbreak in Sonoma County.
[03:33.200 --> 03:36.160]  The first case in America that has an unknown origin.
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.640]  So we may have human to human transmission sustained in California right now.
[03:40.640 --> 03:43.680]  We had, of course, the mayor of San Francisco declare a state of emergency there.
[03:43.680 --> 03:47.000]  Also San Diego County declaring a state of emergency.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.480]  We've got hundreds of people under self quarantine after passing through the Atlanta airport
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.720]  and also a flight attendant who served LAX airport with Korean Airlines has also tested
[03:57.720 --> 04:05.240]  positive and she served passengers from Israel as well as Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea.
[04:05.240 --> 04:09.360]  So a lot of huge breaking news coming up whenever we've got a chance Alex.
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.920]  It's just, it's a, it's a, it's a packed day.
[04:11.920 --> 04:14.280]  There's so much news breaking on every front.
[04:14.280 --> 04:15.720]  It's an unreal time.
[04:15.720 --> 04:18.240]  But that those are the highlights right there.
[04:18.240 --> 04:22.280]  Let's get into Corona then for the next two segments because that ties into the news I
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.880]  just got that I've got a report to people and I don't really take any pleasure in this.
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.680]  I can tell you for a lot of reasons and I'm going to explain that when we come back on
[04:29.680 --> 04:30.680]  the other side.
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.120]  But everybody knows you get straight dealing here.
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.800]  Just I'm compulsive about it.
[04:34.800 --> 04:35.800]  So is Mike Adams.
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.160]  I just can't help it me tell you what's really going on and that's, that's our superpower
[04:41.160 --> 04:46.400]  is that we just don't hold back and it's, it's, it's the key to everything that we're
[04:46.400 --> 04:48.480]  just going to break it all down on the other side.
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.480]  It's why they want us off air.
[04:49.480 --> 04:53.000]  And we got the fact that this corrupt judge was rigging the jury.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  We exposed it.
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.000]  They called for my arrest.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  Well, go to hell.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  I'm going to tell the truth.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.640]  Which the right back stay with us.
[04:59.640 --> 05:03.600]  It's really smart to get high quality, storeable food at m4store.com.

[06:01.920 --> 06:04.520]  Raging war on corruption.
[06:04.520 --> 06:13.280]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:13.280 --> 06:17.720]  We are live ladies and gentlemen and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.720]  I am in DC.
[06:18.720 --> 06:20.560]  I've not gone to CPAC yet.
[06:20.560 --> 06:24.800]  We've got crews there and media that we sponsored doing a lot of great interviews and we'll
[06:24.800 --> 06:28.440]  have some highlights of that for you coming up in the fourth hour today.
[06:28.440 --> 06:29.960]  We've got Mr. T's coming up.
[06:29.960 --> 06:32.680]  We are the former ambassador of the U.N. from the U.S.
[06:32.680 --> 06:40.280]  We also have obviously Mike Adams who is captaining the ship from Austin, Texas.
[06:40.280 --> 06:42.760]  Let's get into it right now.
[06:42.760 --> 06:50.360]  Again, gut level back five weeks ago, I was concerned about coronavirus.
[06:50.360 --> 06:54.520]  Back when they would promote SARS, yeah, I killed some people and other form of pneumonia,
[06:54.520 --> 07:00.360]  but those were hype driven things just to build up world government, U.N. power, CDC
[07:00.360 --> 07:02.360]  power.
[07:02.360 --> 07:06.280]  But we know the global has been obsessed with respiratory viruses, but this virus attacks
[07:06.280 --> 07:07.280]  the heart.
[07:07.280 --> 07:09.400]  You name it, it's incredible.
[07:09.400 --> 07:15.680]  And now we know since the Indian University and others have come out, it's been confirmed.
[07:15.680 --> 07:16.680]  This is manmade.
[07:16.680 --> 07:17.680]  Senator Cotton's come out.
[07:17.680 --> 07:18.680]  It's manmade.
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.520]  Main Street News now goes, okay, it's manmade.
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.560]  That's why it's so scary.
[07:22.560 --> 07:26.280]  Because it mutated to something down the road worse because when they engineer these things,
[07:26.280 --> 07:32.680]  they can then have the sequences tested out in primates, in rats, in other creatures.
[07:32.680 --> 07:34.680]  Remember this thing does attack bats.
[07:34.680 --> 07:35.920]  It does attack horses.
[07:35.920 --> 07:36.920]  It does attack dogs.
[07:36.920 --> 07:42.080]  And usually you don't have viruses that are across a bunch of different species.
[07:42.080 --> 07:43.720]  So it is a chimera.
[07:43.720 --> 07:44.720]  It's manufactured.
[07:44.720 --> 07:49.160]  And we know Obama allowed it to be sold in 2015 to the Chicoms.
[07:49.160 --> 07:50.160]  It was a big scandal.
[07:50.160 --> 07:56.240]  It was in major journals like Science and others that this is insane.
[07:56.240 --> 08:00.680]  Even then, the scientific community criticized the CDC and Obama for allowing this.
[08:00.680 --> 08:03.000]  So there's a plan behind this.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.520]  Now, I don't think we know the exact plan.
[08:05.520 --> 08:06.520]  We know it's a plan.
[08:06.520 --> 08:10.880]  It's like when you look out your window and you see robbers breaking into your garage
[08:10.880 --> 08:14.240]  or in your neighbor's house, you don't know exactly what they're going after, but they
[08:14.240 --> 08:16.960]  got crowbars that were in black masks that were going in the house.
[08:16.960 --> 08:19.120]  So I mean, this is artificial.
[08:19.120 --> 08:20.600]  This is an assault.
[08:20.600 --> 08:25.080]  And you've got the globalists trying to collapse the economy, and you've got 2020, and you've
[08:25.080 --> 08:27.080]  got all this stuff going on.
[08:27.080 --> 08:30.680]  This is synthetic, the whole thing is synthetic.
[08:30.680 --> 08:33.800]  That doesn't mean we know exactly what's happening, but Mike Adams has huge breaking news.
[08:33.800 --> 08:37.200]  I wanted to hit this first.
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.520]  We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them.
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.640]  We don't sell firearms.
[08:42.640 --> 08:47.400]  We promote the fact you should go out, get basic training, and be self-sufficient and
[08:47.400 --> 08:50.080]  learn how to hunt and learn how to garden.
[08:50.080 --> 08:51.680]  I mean, it's just what we're meant to do.
[08:51.680 --> 08:56.040]  It feels good when we do it, but we do sell high-quality, swarble food.
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.360]  And info works quite frankly.
[08:57.360 --> 09:03.040]  I've been spending half my time budgeting and cutting costs, and I'm not complaining.
[09:03.040 --> 09:06.680]  I just rather be on air doing things, but a good three hours a day, four hours a day,
[09:06.680 --> 09:11.120]  I jack around trying to find money and then trying to fund things.
[09:11.120 --> 09:15.160]  The old days, before we were totally deplatformed, I've got a lot of stuff, I never had to worry
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.680]  about money, because I would just do enough to get the money and we needed it.
[09:19.680 --> 09:20.680]  I was dumb.
[09:20.680 --> 09:24.600]  I actually didn't try to build up a bunch of money in case problems ever came.
[09:24.600 --> 09:28.480]  I mean, I built our own infrastructure to get news out, and I saved some money, but
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.720]  I started going through that this year, and I just prayed and God said, hey, it's going
[09:32.720 --> 09:33.720]  to be taken care of.
[09:33.720 --> 09:36.680]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[09:36.680 --> 09:41.000]  We have caught up on a lot of our shortfalls and problems, and I even had to mortgage my
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.560]  house to keep operating, but as soon as I got widows, I paid it in.
[09:45.560 --> 09:49.520]  The money came in, but it came because of the virus, because people know I have the
[09:49.520 --> 09:51.480]  biggest horrible food company as a sponsor.
[09:51.480 --> 09:54.640]  They know they're a high quality company with great food at great prices.
[09:54.640 --> 10:01.480]  They undercut everybody, folks, and I've been talking to them, and I mean, it's real.
[10:01.480 --> 10:02.480]  They sent me the documents.
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.080]  They sent me the emails, and it's not that I even demand it.
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.960]  They just know you give me everything you've got, even though it's restricted, I'm partners
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.560]  with them, so I get all that stuff, the government documents, the emails, I'm basically demanding
[10:14.560 --> 10:16.240]  their food.
[10:16.240 --> 10:19.720]  Everything else is sold out, so here's the development, and this is just about pitching
[10:19.720 --> 10:22.160]  food because food's about to be gone.
[10:22.160 --> 10:25.080]  It's about understanding what's really going on in the back end, and only being in the
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.200]  middle of something like this would you even get that perspective, so again, the Lord works
[10:29.200 --> 10:37.800]  in mysterious ways again, but obviously, I told my patriot a month ago, I said, what
[10:37.800 --> 10:38.800]  can you handle?
[10:38.800 --> 10:40.960]  This is going to be really big, and they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[10:40.960 --> 10:44.000]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.920]  to fund, and I said, no, I think this is going to be huge, I think you should spend everything
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.440]  you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.840]  They agreed, so those are the type of discussions we had, and I'm just giving you the inside
[10:53.840 --> 10:56.520]  baseball of all of this.
[10:56.520 --> 11:01.320]  This is 100 times regular volume plus, it was 100 times a few days ago.
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.240]  Now it's about 200 times, okay?
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.760]  We tried to order from all these other suppliers just to see what you really get from other
[11:08.760 --> 11:11.840]  names, use personal names, things like that.
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.320]  Four weeks later, no food came in, big national talk show host, our pitching stuff that has
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.640]  a patriot in the name, and it hasn't come in four weeks.
[11:21.640 --> 11:24.560]  We ordered from other people, didn't come.
[11:24.560 --> 11:29.400]  People that said seven days, when we tell you four or five weeks, that's the date when
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.720]  you order it with people being counting to make sure that's the case.
[11:35.720 --> 11:39.040]  It upsets me because people need to have affordable food, that there are other companies and groups
[11:39.040 --> 11:44.520]  out there that are telling people they have food and they don't have it, okay?
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.620]  So the good news is we tell the truth, here's the bad news.
[11:49.620 --> 11:56.800]  I have today to tell you that it's now five weeks, and I had long discussions this morning,
[11:56.800 --> 12:01.280]  over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this.
[12:01.280 --> 12:06.160]  A lot of the folks run the plants to get the best idea we have.
[12:06.160 --> 12:12.120]  Today it's five weeks, but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't
[12:12.120 --> 12:13.760]  getting pissed.
[12:13.760 --> 12:19.320]  But understand the last food company, the biggest food company, is now at hundreds of
[12:19.320 --> 12:24.800]  times their regular order, and they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.280]  of food sales next week, and at a certain point just saying we're done because people
[12:30.280 --> 12:33.160]  aren't going to take food orders out 10 weeks.
[12:33.160 --> 12:37.000]  We don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks, and then just all the weirdness that comes
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.080]  with that, because we're honest.
[12:39.080 --> 12:40.600]  So we're having those discussions right now.
[12:40.600 --> 12:43.760]  It's five weeks right now at infowarstore.com.
[12:43.760 --> 12:46.520]  You go right in the queue, first come, first served.
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.080]  But my page of supply is our partner, they're in our computer, it's the same as ordering
[12:50.080 --> 12:51.080]  from them.
[12:51.080 --> 12:55.880]  It just funds information warfare with the 20% or so, and it's helped us, but we don't
[12:55.880 --> 12:59.920]  want to help ourselves stay on air with something bad like this, but this is our model.
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.200]  We're here to be independent, and we're proud of the fact that we're prepositioned, because
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.040]  we're prepositioned for information war, for physical war, for everything.
[13:07.040 --> 13:08.040]  That's what we do.
[13:08.040 --> 13:10.640]  We're about being on our hind feet, ready to fight.
[13:10.640 --> 13:11.640]  We fight.
[13:11.640 --> 13:14.520]  So we fight for a good future, we fight for our children, we're ready.
[13:14.520 --> 13:16.720]  We know what we're talking about.
[13:16.720 --> 13:23.720]  But the fact that the orders are so ultramassive, that it's, I was like, is it 100 times?
[13:23.720 --> 13:27.880]  It's probably more like 150, 200 times, we just, it's dizzying.
[13:27.880 --> 13:29.920]  They already turned on a fourth plant.
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.640]  They're about to turn on a fifth and a sixth with, you know, the federal governments and
[13:35.640 --> 13:36.640]  all these big plants.
[13:36.640 --> 13:39.920]  I mean, these are the huge 200,000 square foot deals we've been there.
[13:39.920 --> 13:40.920]  We've shown you video.
[13:40.920 --> 13:43.080]  I mean, this is just insane.
[13:43.080 --> 13:44.440]  These other companies are fly by night.
[13:44.440 --> 13:45.440]  They don't do that.
[13:45.440 --> 13:49.080]  They sit on some crap food, sell it, keep your money, and then hope later, there's not too
[13:49.080 --> 13:50.560]  many charge backs or whatever.
[13:50.560 --> 13:51.800]  We don't do that.
[13:51.800 --> 13:54.160]  It's five weeks today.
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.920]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe and probably more like five
[13:57.920 --> 13:58.920]  or six.
[13:58.920 --> 14:02.720]  That's just the inside baseball starting tomorrow.
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.200]  And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[14:08.200 --> 14:11.280]  So everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[14:11.280 --> 14:16.480]  But that's how big this is with the federal government and major corporations four weeks
[14:16.480 --> 14:21.760]  ago, basically threatening people, well, you know, there may be a national emergency.
[14:21.760 --> 14:23.720]  We'll just make you sell it to us.
[14:23.720 --> 14:27.240]  And I'm really working to get people on air to tell you that face to face.
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.880]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com.
[14:31.880 --> 14:32.880]  So it's bittersweet.
[14:32.880 --> 14:33.880]  Everybody needs food.
[14:33.880 --> 14:38.560]  I'm proud we're selling high quality food, elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble.
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.160]  This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[14:42.160 --> 14:48.440]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and that this could really
[14:48.440 --> 14:52.600]  help info wars expand and do all these great things while you get prepared at the same time.
[14:52.600 --> 14:57.640]  But I'm looking down the barrel of no, we're going to be honest and just say the just can't
[14:57.640 --> 14:58.640]  handle it.
[14:58.640 --> 14:59.640]  It's too big.
[14:59.640 --> 15:02.640]  And, you know, we're not going to open 10 factories to get all this out.
[15:02.640 --> 15:06.600]  So it's at five weeks right now, it's really going to be like six weeks for the next few
[15:06.600 --> 15:07.600]  days.
[15:07.600 --> 15:12.380]  So they're saying six to eight weeks to get you a buffer under promise over deliver.
[15:12.380 --> 15:14.240]  But technically, it's going to be six to eight weeks.
[15:14.240 --> 15:19.000]  And I'll be on the phone when I get off today with the CEO and with the owner of my patriot
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.640]  to decide what we're going to announce, but we're all in some pateco right now to make
[15:22.640 --> 15:26.200]  sure that we take care of you because we're all family in this and we want you to get
[15:26.200 --> 15:28.840]  a great deal and feel like we took care of you.
[15:28.840 --> 15:30.120]  So you come back again.
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.880]  We want relationships with you.
[15:31.880 --> 15:32.880]  We're not Satanist.
[15:32.880 --> 15:33.880]  We're the opposite.
[15:33.880 --> 15:35.240]  We don't screw people over.
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.200]  We believe in Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you and we're all in this together.
[15:40.200 --> 15:42.640]  Something big is going on with this whole situation.
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.480]  So we're going to break down the latest science, the latest developments with one of the leading

[17:26.960 --> 17:28.720]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.640]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:32.640 --> 17:34.160]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.120]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:37.120 --> 17:40.400]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[18:06.280 --> 18:11.640]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[18:11.640 --> 18:13.360]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[18:13.360 --> 18:16.600]  I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line.
[18:16.600 --> 18:19.760]  You're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face of the globalists,
[18:19.760 --> 18:20.760]  not contract.

[20:22.720 --> 20:25.200]  front lines of the InfoWare.
[20:25.200 --> 20:29.520]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:29.520 --> 20:35.000]  I'm getting ready to saddle up in the war wagon and get over to CPAC here in about 40
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.000]  minutes.
[20:36.000 --> 20:41.600]  Mike Adams will be taking over, but you heard the fact that I just broke down that we have
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.120]  the only storeable food company that's got any real food that they actually deliver.
[20:46.120 --> 20:49.640]  We did a test, and I told them, I said, if this gets really bad, I said, you need to
[20:49.640 --> 20:50.880]  buy all the food forward.
[20:50.880 --> 20:51.880]  That's my advice.
[20:51.880 --> 20:52.880]  They did that.
[20:52.880 --> 20:53.880]  That was already what they wanted to do.
[20:53.880 --> 20:54.880]  They didn't do what I told them.
[20:54.880 --> 20:55.880]  They did.
[20:55.880 --> 20:57.760]  I just agreed what they were saying.
[20:57.760 --> 20:59.280]  But I told them, I said, I'm going to check with other people.
[20:59.280 --> 21:00.840]  They're just going to be so bad.
[21:00.840 --> 21:04.200]  And they said, yeah, everybody else has sold out or it's crap.
[21:04.200 --> 21:05.200]  We made orders.
[21:05.200 --> 21:06.200]  It never came.
[21:06.200 --> 21:09.160]  They lied to us and said seven days of all the companies.
[21:09.160 --> 21:10.160]  We didn't do that.
[21:10.160 --> 21:14.120]  We told you up front, seven to 14 days, and then we had to expand it out.
[21:14.120 --> 21:20.360]  We said five weeks right now, and that's not a gamble, but they feel nervous about even
[21:20.360 --> 21:21.360]  saying that.
[21:21.360 --> 21:23.680]  I mean, because we're taking people's money here.
[21:23.680 --> 21:28.520]  So we're going to probably say eight weeks by tomorrow morning, six to eight weeks just
[21:28.520 --> 21:29.520]  to be safe.
[21:29.520 --> 21:32.600]  And we have the food and got the food.
[21:32.600 --> 21:36.800]  It's just it's not easy to turn on huge factories, OK?
[21:36.800 --> 21:38.160]  So I'm going to stop right there.
[21:38.160 --> 21:41.560]  But Mike Adams, why do you think the ordering of food is so seismic right now?
[21:41.560 --> 21:44.280]  And then let's get into the latest on the coronavirus developments.
[21:44.280 --> 21:46.080]  Well, Alex, I've got a couple of bombshell things.
[21:46.080 --> 21:50.200]  I've been trying to get to you things that you personally need to absolutely need to
[21:50.200 --> 21:52.320]  know big bombshell points.
[21:52.320 --> 21:56.160]  But first to answer your question, the reason is because in Italy, the food supplies were
[21:56.160 --> 21:57.520]  wiped out overnight.
[21:57.520 --> 22:04.320]  The armed roadblock quarantines went into place overnight in Italy around 10 to 12 towns.
[22:04.320 --> 22:11.080]  So you can be living in America today in Michigan, in Denver, in Los Angeles, and you can think
[22:11.080 --> 22:12.640]  everything's fine.
[22:12.640 --> 22:17.160]  Literally in one day, you can be cut off from your grocery store.
[22:17.160 --> 22:23.040]  Now if there are quarantines of entire cities, can UPS even deliver to those cities?
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.880]  I don't even know how that works.
[22:24.880 --> 22:28.120]  UPS hasn't said anything about it or FedEx or the US Mail.
[22:28.120 --> 22:29.120]  I don't know how that works.
[22:29.120 --> 22:32.600]  But the bottom line is the sooner you get in the queue, the faster you're going to get
[22:32.600 --> 22:33.600]  your food.
[22:33.600 --> 22:40.320]  And if you're not in the queue now, your window of opportunity is slamming shut so rapidly.
[22:40.320 --> 22:44.520]  And exactly, and folks, I'll tell you, by the time you buy food at the grocery store,
[22:44.520 --> 22:46.760]  it's got a five, six-time markup on it.
[22:46.760 --> 22:50.480]  Because of the infrastructure, the deliveries and the insurance, the employees and the lawsuits
[22:50.480 --> 22:53.240]  and people falling down saying they broke their back.
[22:53.240 --> 22:55.760]  But with us, you know, the markup's not there.
[22:55.760 --> 22:56.760]  You're getting food the cheapest.
[22:56.760 --> 22:58.960]  You're going to find it for any decent quality.
[22:58.960 --> 23:00.240]  I'm not pitching food anymore.
[23:00.240 --> 23:02.960]  I'm personally just going to tell others this.
[23:02.960 --> 23:08.200]  I am telling you, you need to go to the grocery store and you need to stock up on essentials
[23:08.200 --> 23:13.360]  even though you're going to be paying five, seven times what you should from InfoWorstware.com.
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.800]  You need, and separately, Mike, this isn't even a pitch here, I'm calling back home
[23:18.800 --> 23:23.280]  while I'm out of town and my parents have my children saying, hey, give them elderberry.
[23:23.280 --> 23:24.280]  Give them DNA force.
[23:24.280 --> 23:25.280]  Make sure they take their X2.
[23:25.280 --> 23:27.040]  Make sure they go to sleep early at night.
[23:27.040 --> 23:28.880]  Make sure they get plenty of red meat.
[23:28.880 --> 23:31.520]  I would never put them on an airplane right now.
[23:31.520 --> 23:32.520]  But I'm digressing.
[23:32.520 --> 23:34.880]  You're going to have the next few hours you get into all this.
[23:34.880 --> 23:38.200]  I know keys takes over at one o'clock, you should do the whole next hour by yourself,
[23:38.200 --> 23:39.720]  Mike, because I know this is so critical.
[23:39.720 --> 23:40.720]  People love keys.
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.720]  They need to hear from you.
[23:41.720 --> 23:45.320]  I'm sorry I have you hosting when I end up taking over while the horses couldn't drag
[23:45.320 --> 23:46.320]  me away.
[23:46.320 --> 23:47.520]  But it just hit me.
[23:47.520 --> 23:49.960]  This is a martial law global drill.
[23:49.960 --> 23:54.320]  And I think they know the global economy, the model show, can't be inflated anymore.
[23:54.320 --> 23:57.640]  We've already said this, but now I know this is a reset.
[23:57.640 --> 24:04.160]  This I think is going to be used for a planetary economic collapse to not just try to take
[24:04.160 --> 24:08.200]  out Trump, but to cover up the bubble they've created.
[24:08.200 --> 24:09.200]  We've known that.
[24:09.200 --> 24:10.200]  We've thought of that as a theory.
[24:10.200 --> 24:14.320]  But I'm just gut level seeing all the evidence, and I'm thinking that's what's happening,
[24:14.320 --> 24:15.320]  Mike.
[24:15.320 --> 24:16.320]  Well, absolutely.
[24:16.320 --> 24:17.320]  There's a trap being set for Trump.
[24:17.320 --> 24:19.360]  This is one of the urgent messages I've got to share with you.
[24:19.360 --> 24:24.280]  But first, just to answer your question, as a food scientist myself, I run a food science
[24:24.280 --> 24:25.280]  lab.
[24:25.280 --> 24:28.080]  I do want to mention to people, like what you just said, you need to go to the grocery
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.320]  store and buy the things that can't be in storable foods, which typically includes a
[24:32.320 --> 24:38.080]  lot of oils, so you need to stock up on olive oil, peanut butter, even lard can be used
[24:38.080 --> 24:39.680]  to enhance the food.
[24:39.680 --> 24:43.720]  So when you buy the storable food and you want to stretch it because you didn't buy enough
[24:43.720 --> 24:48.160]  and you have five family members to feed, you can take the chicken flavored rice that
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.280]  you got from Infrawar Store and you can literally add lard to it.
[24:51.280 --> 24:52.840]  I'm not even joking.
[24:52.840 --> 24:53.840]  Add lard to it.
[24:53.840 --> 24:54.840]  That's scooper lard.
[24:54.840 --> 24:55.840]  Exactly.
[24:55.840 --> 24:56.840]  I know.
[24:56.840 --> 24:57.840]  And it sounds people are like, what are you talking about?
[24:57.840 --> 24:58.840]  Health Rangers promoting lard.
[24:58.840 --> 25:00.720]  Hey, I'm also a prepper.
[25:00.720 --> 25:04.600]  I've got butter, I've got olive oil, I've got lard supplies.
[25:04.600 --> 25:05.760]  I'm not even kidding.
[25:05.760 --> 25:10.000]  If you want to live, people need to get raw, storable calories.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  That's right.
[25:11.000 --> 25:12.400]  And peanut butter is a great way to do it.
[25:12.400 --> 25:14.680]  And peanut butter has a limited shelf life.
[25:14.680 --> 25:19.080]  And by the way, out of China, the honey supplies are now getting wiped out because all the
[25:19.080 --> 25:20.320]  honey bees are locked down.
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.240]  I mean, the honey, the beekeepers, excuse me, I guess the honey bees themselves, they don't
[25:24.240 --> 25:25.240]  they don't.
[25:25.240 --> 25:30.880]  And the honey is flying around, telling people not to not even be outside of the farms, which
[25:30.880 --> 25:33.360]  by the way, there's why would they tell farmers don't be in a field?
[25:33.360 --> 25:35.160]  You're not going to get coronavirus there.
[25:35.160 --> 25:39.240]  No, but what you know what happens all these food producers in China, they have to take
[25:39.240 --> 25:42.840]  their food into the cities in order to get processed and then export it.
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.880]  And that's why you see all the eggs and the milk all back.
[25:45.880 --> 25:46.880]  That's right.
[25:46.880 --> 25:47.880]  That's right.
[25:47.880 --> 25:51.480]  Chicken supplies and meat supplies, they're all just getting just completely devastated.
[25:51.480 --> 25:52.480]  Let me ask you that question.
[25:52.480 --> 25:55.360]  We're going to come back and get more into this and the tower next is coming in, but
[25:55.360 --> 25:59.920]  why would China lock down whole cities killing its economy like this unless this is super
[25:59.920 --> 26:00.920]  deadly?
[26:00.920 --> 26:01.920]  That's right.
[26:01.920 --> 26:02.920]  None of this makes sense.
[26:02.920 --> 26:07.320]  No, no, people who are saying this is no big deal, they are clueless.
[26:07.320 --> 26:10.880]  China would not sacrifice their economy for a hoax.
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.880]  This is real.
[26:11.880 --> 26:14.760]  And we only got, look, let me get to this, Alex.
[26:14.760 --> 26:15.760]  This is so crucial.
[26:15.760 --> 26:16.760]  Please, please.
[26:16.760 --> 26:22.000]  Yesterday, Trump held that press conference and he said that America is very, very ready
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.680]  for the coronavirus possibilities.
[26:24.680 --> 26:26.760]  And he said, oh, we're really close to a vaccine.
[26:26.760 --> 26:33.600]  Well, the person that's whispering in Trump's ear is Dr. Fauci from the NIH, who we now know
[26:33.600 --> 26:39.560]  is one of the people who has funneled NIH money into bio weapons research and vaccine
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.560]  research, thanks to Francis Boyle telling us the truth about the death science industry.
[26:44.560 --> 26:50.720]  So we now have the President Trump, just like we said, Alex, being, we believe, misinformed
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.600]  by the very same people who caused this problem.
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.760]  It's their weapon that got loose.
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.840]  And now they claim that they're going to be the saviors and they are advising the President.
[27:00.840 --> 27:04.920]  I think the President has made a crucial mistake and he's being set up for a trap.
[27:04.920 --> 27:07.920]  The CDC has withheld testing kits.
[27:07.920 --> 27:14.040]  There have only been 445 tests conducted nationwide from day one, period, by the CDC.
[27:14.040 --> 27:15.040]  That's it.
[27:15.040 --> 27:16.040]  445.
[27:16.040 --> 27:20.200]  While South Korea has tested over 28,000 people, China has tested hundreds of thousands, other
[27:20.200 --> 27:24.960]  nations are out testing America by factors of 100 to 1, and Trump says we're ready.
[27:24.960 --> 27:29.480]  So we know the deep state blocks Trump at every level and they're medically blocking
[27:29.480 --> 27:30.480]  him again.
[27:30.480 --> 27:32.720]  And when it's a huge disaster, they're going to blame Trump.
[27:32.720 --> 27:33.880]  They're going to blame Trump.
[27:33.880 --> 27:39.240]  The trap has been set and the CDC testing protocols, this is the other big bombshell,
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.840]  there was a case of human to human transmission in Sonoma County confirmed last night, even
[27:43.840 --> 27:45.600]  the Washington Post covered it.
[27:45.600 --> 27:49.840]  That case would normally never have been tested because that person didn't travel from
[27:49.840 --> 27:53.960]  China and was not in close contact with a known confirmed person.
[27:53.960 --> 27:54.960]  So under CDC guidelines.
[27:54.960 --> 27:59.840]  Mike, we'll talk more about this when we come back, but I personally am having a lot of
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.520]  anxiety and when I was a kid, I ignored it, you know, as an adult, but now I've learned
[28:04.520 --> 28:05.520]  to go with it.
[28:05.520 --> 28:06.520]  It's always right.
[28:06.520 --> 28:07.960]  What do you think my big anxiety is about?
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.960]  Is it the trap against Trump?
[28:08.960 --> 28:10.120]  Is it the economy?
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.200]  Or is it the virus is really that deadly?
[28:12.200 --> 28:19.920]  It's that if the deep state plan follows as planned that in November, we will have a President
[28:19.920 --> 28:26.920]  Bernie Sanders, a communist with medical martial law force vaccinations and the criminalization
[28:26.920 --> 28:27.920]  of any anti-vaxxers.
[28:27.920 --> 28:28.920]  That's it.
[28:28.920 --> 28:33.920]  Because now the Democrats officially endorse Sanders, they're going with the common program.
[28:33.920 --> 28:37.920]  That's the scenario that they want to achieve a communist in the White House, total medical
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.280]  martial law, quarantines, criminalization of people like you and I, Alex, they want us
[28:42.280 --> 28:45.600]  in prison while they have mandatory communist control over everything.
[28:45.600 --> 28:47.440]  Mike Adams has cracked the code again.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.440]  That's it.
[28:48.440 --> 28:51.840]  I was thinking that yesterday, reading about Sanders being officially endorsed, how they're
[28:51.840 --> 28:55.000]  lining him up against Trump during a martial law scenario.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.920]  They use the fear and the starey to remove Trump because we're so scared of the virus.
[28:57.920 --> 29:02.480]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:02.480 --> 29:04.400]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:04.400 --> 29:06.080]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:06.080 --> 29:11.560]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[29:11.560 --> 29:12.680]  my life.
[29:12.680 --> 29:17.920]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:17.920 --> 29:23.120]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:23.120 --> 29:26.280]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[29:26.280 --> 29:31.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.280]  and totally change your life.
[29:33.280 --> 29:38.520]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[29:38.520 --> 29:41.800]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[29:41.800 --> 29:42.800]  Get clean.
[29:42.800 --> 29:44.640]  Call now and learn more.

[29:45.640 --> 29:46.640]  800-506-6740.
[29:46.640 --> 29:47.640]  That's 800-506-6740.
[29:47.640 --> 30:05.080]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements, ultra-12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both

[30:59.960 --> 31:00.960]  Real stuff, man.
[31:00.960 --> 31:03.760]  We're talking about the real deal here and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell
[31:03.760 --> 31:07.680]  you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over him, everybody
[31:07.680 --> 31:12.000]  oh, I mean, I've got a problem and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.280]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[31:15.280 --> 31:21.040]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[31:21.040 --> 31:25.920]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment in m4store.com,
[31:25.920 --> 31:28.080]  and it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[31:28.080 --> 31:31.920]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without
[31:31.920 --> 31:32.920]  even disrupting things.
[31:32.920 --> 31:34.480]  People say, why are you doing this?
[31:34.480 --> 31:35.480]  What's happening?
[31:35.480 --> 31:38.680]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[31:38.680 --> 31:42.120]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this
[31:42.120 --> 31:43.120]  yet.
[31:43.120 --> 31:44.120]  It's brilliant.
[31:44.120 --> 31:48.480]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made
[31:48.480 --> 31:49.920]  it into a weapon.
[31:49.920 --> 31:55.440]  You have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people?
[31:55.440 --> 31:58.440]  Silence.
[31:58.440 --> 32:01.400]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[32:01.400 --> 32:05.000]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from

[33:09.080 --> 33:25.600]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide, and obviously I say this to fund InfoWars
[33:25.600 --> 33:29.640]  to promote freedom, to hire more reporters, to beat the globalists that will shut us down.
[33:29.640 --> 33:31.680]  I sell products I believe in.
[33:31.680 --> 33:35.560]  Mike Adams just last week told me, hey, I know you're pitching horrible food, and that's
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.160]  great, but what are you personally doing for yourself?
[33:39.160 --> 33:42.400]  I said, well, I'm taking the normal cell, and it's going to get your kids elderberry
[33:42.400 --> 33:45.080]  and, you know, and, you know, the rest of it.
[33:45.080 --> 33:50.400]  So we have a lot of great products like DNA Force Plus back at Stock 40th and Sof.
[33:50.400 --> 33:54.120]  We have the X2 and X3, the total building block for the whole body to be able to operate,
[33:54.120 --> 33:56.920]  to have that clean, good, atomic iodine.
[33:56.920 --> 34:01.640]  We have the Ultra 12 that gives other foundational for the whole body, high quality bottom B12
[34:01.640 --> 34:02.640]  take it out of the tongue.
[34:02.640 --> 34:04.600]  It's the best you can find out there.
[34:04.600 --> 34:05.600]  Super strong.
[34:05.600 --> 34:09.120]  Every time you change the formula, you got to change the name, so Secret 12 went to Ultra
[34:09.120 --> 34:12.040]  12, got twice as strong, same stuff.
[34:12.040 --> 34:17.280]  And then, vitamin role fusion, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, that just, it's simple stuff
[34:17.280 --> 34:18.280]  like that.
[34:18.280 --> 34:21.320]  InfoWarsStore.com, we're sold out of the winter sun.
[34:21.320 --> 34:26.080]  We have ultimate fish oil that's got three different fish oils, great source of vitamin
[34:26.080 --> 34:27.080]  D spectrum.
[34:27.080 --> 34:28.640]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[34:28.640 --> 34:34.120]  So food is important and a shotgun, bare minimum to protect you and your family, if the globalist
[34:34.120 --> 34:35.800]  are trying to collapse the economy right now.
[34:35.800 --> 34:36.800]  They're making their move.
[34:36.800 --> 34:42.040]  This is their strike back at what Trump and all of us have done and so they're going to
[34:42.040 --> 34:47.280]  try to use this to change our mind about politics and accept status control.
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.000]  That's why Trump's been playing everything down when all these other countries like Italy
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.960]  and others are playing it up, Italy was taken back over by communists.
[34:55.960 --> 35:01.800]  I'm not saying there isn't real cases, people aren't dying, but the status are using this
[35:01.800 --> 35:02.920]  for control.
[35:02.920 --> 35:08.680]  So we take it as serious, we respond, we get prepared, but something bigger is here and
[35:08.680 --> 35:11.560]  I agree with Mike Adams, he's aligned the planets here.
[35:11.560 --> 35:16.680]  This is a move against our economy and against America and against nationalists worldwide.
[35:16.680 --> 35:20.040]  How do we counter that Mike Adams for a few minutes before I bring Tyler next?
[35:20.040 --> 35:22.040]  Well, I do want to mention one thing.
[35:22.040 --> 35:25.840]  When you talk about the five week wait time right now on your food supplies, it's important
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.600]  for your customers to know that when they order other things like vitamin, mineral fusion
[35:30.600 --> 35:34.800]  that that's actually fulfilled out of Austin and those are fulfilled immediately.
[35:34.800 --> 35:35.800]  So the wait time.
[35:35.800 --> 35:39.600]  I'm so glad I should have said, no, that's that's fulfilled the next day.
[35:39.600 --> 35:40.600]  We got money.
[35:40.600 --> 35:41.600]  Exactly.
[35:41.600 --> 35:42.600]  Exactly.
[35:42.600 --> 35:44.800]  So, so the food is coming from a different warehouse from a different shipper and the
[35:44.800 --> 35:50.880]  wait time only applies to the food, but I wonder why our sales of vitamins and stuff
[35:50.880 --> 35:54.640]  went down weight because people think we don't have that no, no, we ship out of Austin.
[35:54.640 --> 35:55.720]  All of that.
[35:55.720 --> 36:00.280]  My patriot is hooked into our computers when we're partners and that and that goes out
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.080]  of Utah and other in Colorado and other places they have factories.
[36:04.080 --> 36:05.080]  Right.
[36:05.080 --> 36:06.080]  Exactly.
[36:06.080 --> 36:08.400]  And I know this because, you know, of course, I run an entire warehouse operation myself.
[36:08.400 --> 36:14.080]  So I know that your team here in Austin actually you've got great products by the way at naturalnews.com.
[36:14.080 --> 36:16.920]  You've got great immune musting formulas at naturalnews.com.
[36:16.920 --> 36:17.920]  Well, thank you.
[36:17.920 --> 36:19.960]  I just want to say your warehouse is keeping up.
[36:19.960 --> 36:20.960]  We are not.
[36:20.960 --> 36:21.960]  We are.
[36:21.960 --> 36:23.680]  We're backlog, but your warehouse is keeping up.
[36:23.680 --> 36:25.920]  So your items are able to ship out right now.
[36:25.920 --> 36:31.640]  But a big breaking item today is that for the first time, South Korea reported infections
[36:31.640 --> 36:35.080]  have now eclipsed China's numbers.
[36:35.080 --> 36:39.400]  So this is now way beyond China, a month away, way beyond bombshell.
[36:39.400 --> 36:40.400]  China's covered it up.
[36:40.400 --> 36:41.400]  South Korea is not.
[36:41.400 --> 36:42.400]  That's what we now know.
[36:42.400 --> 36:43.400]  Yeah, exactly.
[36:43.400 --> 36:47.680]  So when a nation actually does the testing and tells the truth, we see explosive exponential
[36:47.680 --> 36:48.680]  growth.
[36:48.680 --> 36:49.680]  South Korea.
[36:49.680 --> 36:50.680]  I want to stop you there.
[36:50.680 --> 36:51.680]  Yeah.
[36:51.680 --> 36:52.680]  I want to stop you there.
[36:52.680 --> 36:53.680]  I want to stop you, too.
[36:53.680 --> 36:57.440]  In the 2000 moment, South Korea infections has outpaced China.
[36:57.440 --> 36:58.760]  We know that's not true.
[36:58.760 --> 36:59.680]  China has been covering it up.
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.180]  So now we're getting better reporting from a country that's well known for telling the
[37:03.180 --> 37:05.080]  truth about stuff.
[37:05.080 --> 37:06.080]  This is bad news.
[37:06.080 --> 37:07.080]  That's right.
[37:07.080 --> 37:08.080]  And just to be clear.
[37:08.080 --> 37:10.880]  The aggregate number is not yet as high as China, but I'm talking about the daily number
[37:10.880 --> 37:14.720]  now today's numbers out of South Korea are larger than today's numbers out of China.
[37:14.720 --> 37:17.240]  So this outbreak is uncontained.
[37:17.240 --> 37:18.720]  It's going to go global.
[37:18.720 --> 37:21.120]  Paul Joseph Watson recently yesterday had a story.
[37:21.120 --> 37:27.120]  UK government document warns that coronavirus could infect 80% of the people in the United
[37:27.120 --> 37:29.480]  Kingdom and kill half a million Brits.
[37:29.480 --> 37:31.280]  That's a leaked document.
[37:31.280 --> 37:33.440]  Paul Joseph Watson is absolutely correct on that.
[37:33.440 --> 37:34.440]  Other scientists are predicting.
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.440]  That article is so huge.
[37:35.440 --> 37:37.440]  I mean, that is huge.
[37:37.440 --> 37:38.600]  Absolutely.
[37:38.600 --> 37:39.600]  And then we have the...
[37:39.600 --> 37:42.600]  I don't normally just say every 10 seconds, this is huge, this is huge.
[37:42.600 --> 37:46.560]  I mean, this is just a crescendo and the way the world works.
[37:46.560 --> 37:49.480]  When things crescendo, they tend to keep crescendoing.
[37:49.480 --> 37:52.520]  I get this feeling like we're about to see stuff get crazy, Mike.
[37:52.520 --> 37:56.280]  I can barely keep up myself and I've got a whole editorial team like you do.
[37:56.280 --> 37:57.280]  We can barely keep up.
[37:57.280 --> 37:58.560]  But listen to this.
[37:58.560 --> 38:01.240]  Iranian vice president now confirmed infected.
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.600]  So this is, and it's killed the Iranian ambassador to the Vatican now.
[38:06.600 --> 38:13.520]  And this is the man who five days ago or so was on video sweating and obviously very sick
[38:13.520 --> 38:16.880]  telling everybody that it's all under control, everything is fine.
[38:16.880 --> 38:19.320]  And this is like a science fiction dystopia movie.
[38:19.320 --> 38:20.320]  I didn't even know this.
[38:20.320 --> 38:21.640]  I'm busy at CPAC.
[38:21.640 --> 38:25.360]  You're telling me that now a government officials are dying.
[38:25.360 --> 38:26.360]  This shows.
[38:26.360 --> 38:27.360]  Yes.
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.000]  It's got to be race specific because we know the Iranians are mixed in with Asian blood
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.920]  lines or is it a cover for another bio attack on Iran?
[38:33.920 --> 38:34.920]  What the hell?
[38:34.920 --> 38:39.660]  Well, even when it has greater propensity for certain races, it's still highly dangerous
[38:39.660 --> 38:40.900]  for any race.
[38:40.900 --> 38:45.440]  So you have people in Italy getting infected, you know, white people can get infected, Europeans
[38:45.440 --> 38:46.440]  can get infected.
[38:46.440 --> 38:49.560]  It's, it's dangerous to everybody, but the infection rate is higher.
[38:49.560 --> 38:50.560]  Now there was some.
[38:50.560 --> 38:51.800]  Why is it so bad?
[38:51.800 --> 38:52.800]  And I ran.
[38:52.800 --> 39:00.800]  Well, that is the people of that region have more ace to receptor sites in the respiratory
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.800]  systems, not as much as people in Japan, by the way, or people in China, but more than
[39:04.800 --> 39:06.960]  people from Northern Europe.
[39:06.960 --> 39:11.300]  But there, the South China Morning Post has been covering this as well.
[39:11.300 --> 39:15.320]  And that, you know, that newspaper is kind of a little bit of a government mouthpiece,
[39:15.320 --> 39:19.560]  but even they are now admitting that there's an HIV component in the virus.
[39:19.560 --> 39:20.800]  They call it a mutation.
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.240]  It's not a mutation.
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.280]  It was engineered and they say that it makes it super infectious now.
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.420]  So you have even the mainstream media of Asia now confirming what Info Wars reported three
[39:31.420 --> 39:32.660]  weeks ago.
[39:32.660 --> 39:37.200]  So, you know, once again, the media is catching up to what we were talking about weeks ago
[39:37.200 --> 39:38.200]  or a month ago.
[39:38.200 --> 39:41.280]  And by the way, Mike, I feel totally sick to my stomach.
[39:41.280 --> 39:42.480]  We've been proven right.
[39:42.480 --> 39:44.440]  There's no pleasure in any of this.
[39:44.440 --> 39:45.440]  It's disgusting.
[39:45.440 --> 39:46.440]  I know.
[39:46.440 --> 39:49.040]  I'm almost feel guilty that I'm here at CPAC and not home in Austin.
[39:49.040 --> 39:50.040]  I'm almost feel guilty.
[39:50.040 --> 39:51.240]  I'm on an airplane.
[39:51.240 --> 39:56.480]  Well, I look, you, I know that you're taking every step to protect yourself because you're
[39:56.480 --> 40:02.640]  traveling, but Atlanta airport has now, they've said that they have told 200 people who
[40:02.640 --> 40:05.160]  went through Atlanta to self quarantine.
[40:05.160 --> 40:09.680]  And I've got a quote somewhere here from the general manager of the Atlanta airport.
[40:09.680 --> 40:10.680]  Here it is.
[40:10.680 --> 40:12.320]  He says, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[40:12.320 --> 40:15.040]  He says Atlanta is in good shape.
[40:15.040 --> 40:18.680]  Even though they've had 200 people put into self quarantine there or they're just here
[40:18.680 --> 40:20.480]  to hear them parroting Trump.
[40:20.480 --> 40:21.480]  Trump thinks he saved the economy.
[40:21.480 --> 40:23.520]  I get why he's doing this, but they're setting him up.
[40:23.520 --> 40:24.520]  You're right.
[40:24.520 --> 40:25.520]  Right.
[40:25.520 --> 40:26.520]  It's gonna get really bad.
[40:26.520 --> 40:27.520]  They're setting Trump up.
[40:27.520 --> 40:28.520]  His name is John Selden.
[40:28.520 --> 40:32.600]  He says, quote, nationwide, there has been only one person who has come through a U.S.
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.600]  airport with the virus.
[40:34.600 --> 40:36.100]  Are you kidding me?
[40:36.100 --> 40:37.100]  Are you kidding me?
[40:37.100 --> 40:40.720]  You think that in this nation, we still have flights to Korea, flights to Italy, flights
[40:40.720 --> 40:42.240]  to all these infected countries.
[40:42.240 --> 40:45.120]  You think there's only been one person come through a U.S. airport?
[40:45.120 --> 40:46.120]  I stay there, man.
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.320]  You're going to take over next hour, do the whole next hour, the keys will do the third
[40:50.320 --> 40:51.320]  hour.
[40:51.320 --> 40:52.320]  He's been doing a great job.
[40:52.320 --> 40:53.320]  But this is, this is so important.
[40:53.320 --> 40:54.840]  So I'm just saying, do the next hour.
[40:54.840 --> 40:57.280]  We have Tyler next year.
[40:57.280 --> 41:00.280]  People can say, okay, all this big stuff's going on.
[41:00.280 --> 41:01.280]  We have a judge.
[41:01.280 --> 41:02.280]  She rigged a jury.
[41:02.280 --> 41:03.280]  She's been caught.
[41:03.280 --> 41:04.280]  The government's corrupt big deal.
[41:04.280 --> 41:07.640]  No, they were beta testing this to roll it out everywhere.
[41:07.640 --> 41:10.600]  They admit that she's been caught rigging the jury.
[41:10.600 --> 41:15.600]  Now she's trying to suppress anyone finding out who else is on the jury.
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.880]  And Trump is right to press on this because it could bring down the whole deep state.
[41:18.880 --> 41:21.520]  It's bigger than Berman Jackson.
[41:21.520 --> 41:24.800]  This is about the fake Pfizer warrants.
[41:24.800 --> 41:26.360]  It's all about this system.
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.920]  So Roger Stone's personal lawyer, not the lawyer on the case, but his personal lawyer,
[41:30.920 --> 41:35.720]  Tyler Nixon is here with us in Washington, D.C. right now, and this is a key to bringing
[41:35.720 --> 41:36.720]  down the deep state.
[41:36.720 --> 41:39.160]  So that's why we're covering it right now in the middle of this.
[41:39.160 --> 41:42.560]  So give us, we've got three minutes, two minutes to break, but just give us a synopsis.
[41:42.560 --> 41:45.040]  We'll come back for a few segments with Tyler next.
[41:45.040 --> 41:46.040]  Sure.
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.840]  Well, you know, the current state of things is that Roger's waiting for a decision from
[41:50.840 --> 41:52.880]  the judge on the motion for a new trial.
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.000]  Now she's come out swinging against Tucker Carlson, against the president practically.
[41:57.000 --> 42:04.120]  I mean, I think this is really the most flailing judicial officer I've ever seen.
[42:04.120 --> 42:07.520]  And it's because I think she gets that she, the whole thing's exposed.
[42:07.520 --> 42:12.040]  I mean, you cannot have a juror with that much bias and call it a fair trial.
[42:12.040 --> 42:16.120]  And it's not a matter of, well, you know, she, you can explain it away.
[42:16.120 --> 42:21.760]  Clearly there was bias before and the juror, if we were to believe the documents, she basically
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.440]  either lied or deceived the court in order to get on the jury.
[42:25.440 --> 42:28.160]  She minimized her social media posts.
[42:28.160 --> 42:32.480]  So you have, we're not just saying this, they have, this is like textbook jury wrecking.
[42:32.480 --> 42:36.600]  The judge like is in there saying, oh, don't worry, she worked for Obama, by the way, media
[42:36.600 --> 42:37.600]  don't report that.
[42:37.600 --> 42:38.600]  But we have her.
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.600]  We have her.
[42:39.600 --> 42:40.600]  This is ridiculous.
[42:40.600 --> 42:41.600]  Yeah.
[42:41.600 --> 42:44.520]  I mean, she was, she said during the trial, basically like, well, the fact that you were
[42:44.520 --> 42:49.680]  held a position in an opposite administration doesn't make it worse.
[42:49.680 --> 42:50.680]  Stay there.
[42:50.680 --> 42:51.680]  Let's, let's lay this out.
[42:51.680 --> 42:53.240]  This could bring down the whole deep state folks.
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.040]  I smell blood.
[42:55.040 --> 42:56.040]  I smell blood.
[42:56.040 --> 42:58.320]  I'm globalist politically forever.
[42:58.320 --> 43:02.400]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.560]  seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[43:06.560 --> 43:07.560]  That's good.
[43:07.560 --> 43:09.440]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.760]  The average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know
[43:14.760 --> 43:16.440]  how to change their tire.
[43:16.440 --> 43:19.800]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.440]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three week food supply that you know
[43:24.440 --> 43:27.800]  is always there that you only go to in emergencies.
[43:27.800 --> 43:32.880]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so.
[43:32.880 --> 43:37.640]  And things like DNA force plus that's now back in stock is so good for your cells, your
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.200]  mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[43:41.200 --> 43:47.040]  It's back in stock 40% off right now along with ultra 12 and along with vitamin mental

[43:56.720 --> 44:02.800]  A total 360 win Al killer in New Jersey.
[44:02.800 --> 44:03.800]  You're on the air.
[44:03.800 --> 44:04.800]  Go ahead.
[44:04.800 --> 44:05.800]  Alex.
[44:05.800 --> 44:06.800]  Hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[44:06.800 --> 44:09.760]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.000]  So that's super blue floor free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  on another level.
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  I use the one.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.440]  I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into
[44:19.440 --> 44:20.440]  your gum.
[44:20.440 --> 44:22.880]  It's just by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[44:22.880 --> 44:25.760]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.400]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better
[44:30.400 --> 44:33.960]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[44:33.960 --> 44:36.720]  So I just want to get that out of the way to support this man.
[44:36.720 --> 44:37.720]  Everything that he exposed.
[44:37.720 --> 44:39.320]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[44:39.320 --> 44:40.440]  Nobody knew about FD.
[44:40.440 --> 44:41.760]  Nobody knew about Build-A-Bird.
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.080]  Nobody called 9 11 before it happened in July 2001.
[44:45.080 --> 44:46.080]  Go look it up yourself.
[44:46.080 --> 44:47.200]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[44:47.200 --> 44:49.360]  They definitely want to stop the year without you or not here.
[44:49.360 --> 44:50.360]  Yeah.
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.360]  These are all great products.
[44:51.360 --> 44:52.360]  So thank you, sir.
[44:52.360 --> 44:53.360]  Don't be a victim.
[44:53.360 --> 45:04.360]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your
[45:04.360 --> 45:05.360]  immune system.
[45:05.360 --> 45:08.480]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down and you have plenty
[45:08.480 --> 45:09.480]  of hydration.
[45:09.480 --> 45:11.760]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[45:11.760 --> 45:15.200]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[45:15.200 --> 45:16.360]  Take your colloidal silver.
[45:16.360 --> 45:17.360]  All of it.
[45:17.360 --> 45:20.480]  All of it allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[45:20.480 --> 45:25.280]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that Pat did and
[45:25.280 --> 45:28.720]  documented and even admitted and documents we've shown that go after this whole Corona
[45:28.720 --> 45:29.720]  SARS family.
[45:29.720 --> 45:30.720]  A virus.
[45:30.720 --> 45:34.080]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles that'll be sold out a couple days
[45:34.080 --> 45:37.560]  and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[45:37.560 --> 45:38.720]  Great to have period.
[45:38.720 --> 45:39.720]  Really good for your gums.
[45:39.720 --> 45:40.720]  Really great for your teeth.
[45:40.720 --> 45:42.960]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[45:42.960 --> 45:46.400]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top
[45:46.400 --> 45:50.200]  nano tech company based here in the U.S. that's in only some way security documents and everything
[45:50.200 --> 45:51.800]  because we get the best stuff.
[45:51.800 --> 45:52.800]  There's a lot of patriots.
[45:52.800 --> 45:56.720]  There's not just bad guys coming after us with the flip side of all the good guys and
[45:56.720 --> 45:57.720]  good gals.
[45:57.720 --> 45:58.720]  It's very exciting.
[45:58.720 --> 46:03.880]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high quality storeable food we sell at m4store.com.
[46:03.880 --> 46:08.040]  But everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high quality at a great price because
[46:08.040 --> 46:09.920]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[46:09.920 --> 46:12.880]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[46:12.880 --> 46:18.960]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, my patriot, is now three
[46:18.960 --> 46:20.840]  to four weeks out before they ship food.
[46:20.840 --> 46:22.880]  They have the food, but they've got to package it.
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.240]  And any day now they may come and tell me, oh, sorry, we're not selling food anymore
[46:27.240 --> 46:30.200]  because they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[46:30.200 --> 46:33.440]  Now, you get your order in now, you get the high quality food.
[46:33.440 --> 46:34.440]  It's a smart move.
[46:34.440 --> 46:35.480]  It funds the m4.
[46:35.480 --> 46:36.480]  You can't lose.
[46:36.480 --> 46:40.480]  Take action at m4store.com whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks,
[46:40.480 --> 46:42.520]  a three month, a six month a year.
[46:42.520 --> 46:45.440]  They've got it all at m4store.com.
[46:45.440 --> 46:46.440]  They're in our back end.
[46:46.440 --> 46:47.440]  We're partnered with them.
[46:47.440 --> 46:49.600]  They'll ship it out to you the day it's packaged.
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.400]  They've got the food, but they are days and days behind shipping it out.
[46:53.400 --> 47:01.640]  So get your order in now to lock it in and it funds the m4 or 361 m4store.com.
[47:01.640 --> 47:22.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show and we are back with Tyler Nixon.
[47:22.800 --> 47:26.760]  He was ranting during that three minute break or whatever.
[47:26.760 --> 47:29.600]  Tyler, you were just nailing it.
[47:29.600 --> 47:34.960]  Now they have political articles with major professors saying, oh, presidents can't pardon
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.320]  when Bill Clinton was pardoning cocaine dealers and all the rest of it.
[47:39.320 --> 47:42.360]  This is their full assault on reality.
[47:42.360 --> 47:43.360]  This is desperation.
[47:43.360 --> 47:48.640]  Yeah, it shows you how they're willing to basically this rule of law stuff and truth
[47:48.640 --> 47:49.640]  matters.
[47:49.640 --> 47:51.440]  That is the biggest bunch of bunk with these people.
[47:51.440 --> 47:56.040]  They are absolutely a situation in context dependent on what side they take of things
[47:56.040 --> 48:02.000]  whether they agree with the Constitution, whether it's against the Constitution.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.080]  It's not a major law professor, but it's a law professor, someone who's teaching law
[48:06.080 --> 48:12.680]  students and a Brown University professor as well says that the impeachment, because
[48:12.680 --> 48:18.120]  it says the pardon power accepts cases of impeachment, they're trying to read that as
[48:18.120 --> 48:22.880]  saying that he loses the pardon power merely by being impeached.
[48:22.880 --> 48:30.960]  No, he's a president can't pardon his own impeachment, but he was not found guilty and
[48:30.960 --> 48:32.480]  it's not an impeachment case.
[48:32.480 --> 48:38.200]  This is why it's like Bergman Jackson saying, Trump is harassing a jury that months ago
[48:38.200 --> 48:39.200]  was done.
[48:39.200 --> 48:44.400]  Yeah, or Roger Stone being gagged after he's been convicted when the whole premise of
[48:44.400 --> 48:45.400]  it was jury tenure.
[48:45.400 --> 48:46.400]  Never been done before.
[48:46.400 --> 48:47.400]  Never.
[48:47.400 --> 48:48.400]  Never.
[48:48.400 --> 48:49.400]  So she's desperate.
[48:49.400 --> 48:54.280]  This is a $20 trillion question, she's trying to suppress the names of the jurors when the
[48:54.280 --> 48:57.640]  Supreme Court says they shall be public, not because we want to harass them.
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.280]  We want to see what the last foreman she tried to get work as the head of the department
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.920]  for Obama or her husband worked for him, the Russia probe, the next woman's DNC Brazil
[49:05.920 --> 49:08.960]  minion that ran for high office.
[49:08.960 --> 49:09.960]  These are operatives.
[49:09.960 --> 49:10.960]  We want to see the other ones.
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.880]  Well, no wonder she wants to keep it secret because we know then that whole thing is stacked
[49:15.880 --> 49:16.880]  impact.
[49:16.880 --> 49:17.880]  Yeah.
[49:17.880 --> 49:19.720]  You know, it's bye-bye.
[49:19.720 --> 49:22.200]  You're going to prison, Miss Jackson.
[49:22.200 --> 49:25.380]  I'd like to, I'm so glad you raised this point.
[49:25.380 --> 49:28.640]  We do not have secret juries in the United States of America.
[49:28.640 --> 49:31.080]  That was one of the reasons this country was founded, okay?
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.800]  A secret jury was also called a star chamber.
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.400]  You cannot, the public, that's why we have public trials as well.
[49:37.400 --> 49:38.560]  We don't do things in secret.
[49:38.560 --> 49:43.400]  We don't have secret tribunals, except maybe in the case of like a military tribunal in
[49:43.400 --> 49:44.960]  the midst of an actual hot war.
[49:44.960 --> 49:49.600]  Other than that, though, the public has the right to know who these jurors are and also
[49:49.600 --> 49:55.920]  to, for themselves, verify, you know, what they say, such as Ms. Hart, who said she never
[49:55.920 --> 50:00.560]  posted, she doesn't think she posted anything on social media about Roger or the case or
[50:00.560 --> 50:01.560]  anything to do with that.
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.680]  And it turns out, you know, public Mike Cernvich jumped in there and found out, no, you in
[50:05.680 --> 50:10.120]  fact did, which not only says she's partisan, but she also lied, basically, or tried to
[50:10.120 --> 50:11.120]  conceal.
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.680]  And she says, Stone's conviction proves Trump colluded with Russia.
[50:15.680 --> 50:16.680]  That's nowhere in there.
[50:16.680 --> 50:19.680]  I mean, this woman is a flame-throwing liar.
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.640]  Well, even, and similar along those lines, the pardoned people are saying that, oh,
[50:24.640 --> 50:28.920]  excuse me, there's another, another professor came out, similarly, saying the executive
[50:28.920 --> 50:33.840]  branch, pardon power, should be checked by the judicial branch in cases where there's
[50:33.840 --> 50:36.840]  corruption involved and the abuse of power impeachment.
[50:36.840 --> 50:37.840]  They're trying to say that.
[50:37.840 --> 50:38.840]  They're claiming powers that aren't in the Constitution.
[50:38.840 --> 50:42.000]  How does the Ukrainian phone call over which he was impeached have anything to do with
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Roger Stone and WikiLeaks or even anything?
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  No, it doesn't.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.080]  So let's just stop right there.
[50:46.080 --> 50:47.080]  Yeah.
[50:47.080 --> 50:48.280]  They're desperate.
[50:48.280 --> 50:49.780]  They're losing.
[50:49.780 --> 50:50.780]  What are they going to do next?
[50:50.780 --> 50:51.920]  This is bigger than Roger Stone.
[50:51.920 --> 50:56.360]  It's bigger than Judge LaFraud Jackson.
[50:56.360 --> 50:57.360]  It's bigger.
[50:57.360 --> 51:03.960]  It's that they're this crazy and they're attempting to overthrow jurisprudence and checks and balances.
[51:03.960 --> 51:06.600]  But the checks and balances, the founders set up, are defeating them.
[51:06.600 --> 51:08.960]  This is like masterwork of the founders.
[51:08.960 --> 51:12.880]  It just makes you go, man, these guys, you know, he's like Jedi warlords.
[51:12.880 --> 51:14.240]  So let's get Mike Adams take on this.
[51:14.240 --> 51:15.240]  Mike, you're listening to this.
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.480]  I mean, we have huge news of coronavirus and the economy and the globalist.
[51:19.480 --> 51:24.400]  But I mean, the fact that they were weaponizing the judiciary and admitted they were going
[51:24.400 --> 51:29.280]  to arrest all of Trump supporters and that they're failing here, this is real victory.
[51:29.280 --> 51:32.360]  That's why I'm trying to drive this, this victory home.
[51:32.360 --> 51:38.800]  Well, the big picture, I believe, is not just involving Roger Stone and Judge Jackson, but
[51:38.800 --> 51:44.680]  the fact that the entire public of America will lose every last shred of remaining faith
[51:44.680 --> 51:49.180]  in the institutions of the rule of law, the judiciary and the government itself.
[51:49.180 --> 51:53.360]  What happens to a society when the public loses faith in the system?
[51:53.360 --> 51:55.640]  This is a fourth turning moment.
[51:55.640 --> 51:58.840]  And that will be the collapse of a mind-binding society.
[51:58.840 --> 51:59.840]  No, I agree.
[51:59.840 --> 52:01.840]  So, so, Mike, there's, I'm asking you, I respect you.
[52:01.840 --> 52:06.560]  You know, they're so reckless, they're killing every convention, all chivalry.
[52:06.560 --> 52:07.560]  They think chivalry is wimpy.
[52:07.560 --> 52:10.080]  No, it's so you don't burn everything down.
[52:10.080 --> 52:11.600]  So what do you expect them to do next?
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.560]  I mean, they're just like balls in the walls, zombie attack right now.
[52:15.560 --> 52:19.400]  Well, look, I don't want to take away from, from Tyler Nixon's time.
[52:19.400 --> 52:23.080]  He's the expert in this area, but I want to hear what you think they're going to do.
[52:23.080 --> 52:27.280]  They're going to do absolutely everything and kill any number of people or allow millions
[52:27.280 --> 52:31.320]  of people to die through this pandemic, anything it takes for them to establish power because
[52:31.320 --> 52:32.320]  they have a ban on the rule of law.
[52:32.320 --> 52:33.320]  You just said it.
[52:33.320 --> 52:36.120]  There's no limit to what a psychotic criminal will do, Tyler.
[52:36.120 --> 52:40.440]  Yeah, look at Pelosi and Sanders already trying to make political hay, and Chris, even the
[52:40.440 --> 52:44.680]  senator from my former state, Chris Coons, on TV talking about Trump's response to the
[52:44.680 --> 52:48.440]  coronavirus and all that, you know, criticizing and using it as a political issue.
[52:48.440 --> 52:53.880]  These are nothing these people, life or death, will not use in order to somehow consolidate,
[52:53.880 --> 52:57.760]  gather, grow, or expand their political power and their autocracy.
[52:57.760 --> 53:01.440]  And people should recognize them as criminals scum and reject them.
[53:01.440 --> 53:02.440]  We're just done.
[53:02.440 --> 53:03.440]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[53:03.440 --> 53:07.840]  Authority, they only exist in authority because we recognize it as a people and we collectively
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.320]  say, and that's what Mike's getting to, we, the true deep state, the American people
[53:12.320 --> 53:15.160]  have to act now because the communists are smart.
[53:15.160 --> 53:19.160]  They're discrediting the system by their own actions to then overthrow it and bring in
[53:19.160 --> 53:20.160]  their system.
[53:20.160 --> 53:22.720]  This is a real attempt at overthrowing the republic, folks.
[53:22.720 --> 53:25.280]  So libertarians like, what are you doing to defend the state?
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.360]  The republic against communists, I back that state.
[53:28.360 --> 53:30.600]  Yeah, I mean, they thrive on chaos.
[53:30.600 --> 53:35.360]  They make hay of every, I mean, all Rahm Emanuel in crisis, there's opportunity, never, never
[53:35.360 --> 53:36.360]  not exploited crisis.
[53:36.360 --> 53:40.000]  I mean, that is the Democrat mantra it always has been, but, you know, creating the crises
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.920]  too is another one of their thing.
[53:41.920 --> 53:46.600]  I mean, this, it's lawless, it's a constitutional, it's almost post-constitutional the way they
[53:46.600 --> 53:47.600]  act.
[53:47.600 --> 53:51.440]  And, you know, with regard to the stone thing, I mean, to challenge the pardon power never
[53:51.440 --> 53:57.560]  in 220, 30 years of this republic has any credible scholar legal or otherwise said the
[53:57.560 --> 54:03.160]  pardon power is somehow limited or reviewable by the judiciary or, or, you know, limited
[54:03.160 --> 54:06.720]  by any act of Congress, much less one, one house upon.
[54:06.720 --> 54:10.520]  And they're attempting to say, just like the First Amendment doesn't exist, they're saying,
[54:10.520 --> 54:11.520]  or the second, right?
[54:11.520 --> 54:12.520]  No, it does.
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.520]  It's right there.
[54:13.520 --> 54:14.520]  That's what it's all about.
[54:14.520 --> 54:15.960]  We went to war with the British Empire for it.
[54:15.960 --> 54:16.960]  We have a right to have guns.
[54:16.960 --> 54:19.160]  Go North Korea if you don't like it.
[54:19.160 --> 54:22.200]  Yeah, the Second Amendment's not about hunting in and target shooting.
[54:22.200 --> 54:23.200]  It's about having a.
[54:23.200 --> 54:26.760]  It's about, I'm not a slave and I have a right to defend myself.
[54:26.760 --> 54:30.160]  And it doesn't mean you have to take a, an AR-15 up against an F-15.
[54:30.160 --> 54:31.160]  Give me a break.
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.160]  It's a deterrent.
[54:32.160 --> 54:33.160]  Okay.
[54:33.160 --> 54:34.160]  Oh, that swallows well.
[54:34.160 --> 54:37.760]  If you don't turn your guns in, we'll nuke you, showing how disconnected from reality
[54:37.760 --> 54:38.760]  he is.
[54:38.760 --> 54:39.760]  He doesn't even know what weapons are for.
[54:39.760 --> 54:41.640]  He doesn't know what weapons you use.
[54:41.640 --> 54:46.160]  You would lose the debate the day you use the nuke, dumbass, plus it destroys whole
[54:46.160 --> 54:47.840]  cities and infrastructures.
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.280]  You don't use, we couldn't defeat Vietnam because we shouldn't be there.
[54:52.280 --> 54:53.920]  You can't defeat America.
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.240]  You think you can defeat America, you commies?
[54:56.240 --> 54:58.680]  As long as we can expose you as the enemy, you're done.
[54:58.680 --> 54:59.680]  Mike Adams.
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.520]  Well, this, this is the end of human civilization in the organized structure if we don't defend
[55:05.520 --> 55:06.520]  it.
[55:06.520 --> 55:07.520]  Okay.
[55:07.520 --> 55:08.520]  This is the total collapse.
[55:08.520 --> 55:11.440]  These are just signs of collapse when you have a corrupt judge like this who simply
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.440]  abandons the rule of law.
[55:12.440 --> 55:17.000]  Yeah, there's an assault on civilization and the anti-capitalists go, oh, we don't need
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  that.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.800]  Well, yeah, if we incrementally built towards self-individualism and ruggedness, we could
[55:21.800 --> 55:24.000]  build towards a point of almost no government.
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.240]  With the swab world we've got, we need a government of the people to defend against other governments.
[55:30.240 --> 55:31.560]  That's what libertarians never get.
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.160]  There's other governments coming at you.
[55:34.160 --> 55:36.480]  You've got to have an organization to defeat that, Mike.
[55:36.480 --> 55:43.880]  Well, and in a way, Roger Stone is now a historical, an historical figure of great importance because
[55:43.880 --> 55:49.000]  of his role in causing the deep state to expose their lawless and criminality at a level we've
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  never seen before.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.400]  Roger Stone has invoked the total frothing lawlessness and evil of the people.
[55:56.400 --> 55:57.400]  Exactly, Mike Adams.
[55:57.400 --> 55:58.400]  That's poetry right there.
[55:58.400 --> 56:04.400]  How did Roger Stone, with the M4s combination, summon the Leviathan that is now destroying
[56:04.400 --> 56:05.400]  the deep state?
[56:05.400 --> 56:06.760]  Why did they get so scared of Roger?
[56:06.760 --> 56:08.000]  He's so effective.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.760]  He said it in Get Me Roger Stone.
[56:09.760 --> 56:12.960]  You know, they hate me because you wouldn't hate me if I weren't effective.
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.200]  They come after the people, artists, who are the most threat of a threat to them.
[56:17.200 --> 56:18.800]  It shows them how they've come after you, Alex.
[56:18.800 --> 56:24.480]  I mean, frankly, the lawsuits, just the lawfare, the de-platforming, all of it.
[56:24.480 --> 56:25.480]  Hunters of allies again.
[56:25.480 --> 56:26.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:26.480 --> 56:27.480]  Radio-wise.
[56:27.480 --> 56:28.480]  Rig search engines.
[56:28.480 --> 56:32.240]  Yeah, you're the biggest threat to them because you don't have any fear to speak out and speak
[56:32.240 --> 56:35.040]  the truth and speak it loudly and accurately as well.
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.040]  You're not shading it.
[56:36.040 --> 56:38.680]  You're not giving it a spin or a veneer.
[56:38.680 --> 56:43.400]  And they live on the ability to manipulate not just words and facts and circumstances
[56:43.400 --> 56:44.400]  but reality.
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.800]  I mean, it's like the whole thing, the whole left, it's gaslighting.
[56:48.800 --> 56:53.000]  They want you to believe that any reality they tell you is what we have to go with.
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.440]  I think this was found out of the cancer that is the Clintons that came to this town, 27
[56:58.440 --> 56:59.440]  years ago.
[56:59.440 --> 57:00.440]  They would just murder everybody.
[57:00.440 --> 57:01.440]  Yeah.
[57:01.440 --> 57:02.440]  No, they brought this like...
[57:02.440 --> 57:03.440]  I think that's our greatest work.
[57:03.440 --> 57:07.120]  They would just stand there and say, go, I can kill me, but I'm going to expose you.
[57:07.120 --> 57:08.120]  That loses the fear.
[57:08.120 --> 57:09.120]  That's right.
[57:09.120 --> 57:10.120]  They don't get that anymore.
[57:10.120 --> 57:11.120]  You're like, you're going to murder me?
[57:11.120 --> 57:12.120]  Let's go.
[57:12.120 --> 57:13.120]  Yeah.
[57:13.120 --> 57:14.120]  And before that was shame.
[57:14.120 --> 57:16.120]  You used to be able to shame people out of, you know, I mean, the establishment, if
[57:16.120 --> 57:19.600]  you were actually crooked, you know, there's sort of consensus, well, nobody's going to
[57:19.600 --> 57:20.760]  defend this person.
[57:20.760 --> 57:21.760]  So they're on their own.
[57:21.760 --> 57:24.040]  Let's shame them for Sandy Hook, for questioning.
[57:24.040 --> 57:25.040]  Yeah.
[57:25.040 --> 57:26.040]  No, no, no.
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.040]  Yeah.
[57:27.040 --> 57:28.040]  Yeah.
[57:28.040 --> 57:29.040]  And none of it works.
[57:29.040 --> 57:30.040]  It's pathetic.
[57:30.040 --> 57:31.040]  I mean, all you do is exercise your personal rights and raise questions.
[57:31.040 --> 57:32.040]  You didn't even make statements.
[57:32.040 --> 57:33.040]  All you do is ask questions.
[57:33.040 --> 57:34.040]  You can't even ask questions.
[57:34.040 --> 57:35.040]  And frankly...
[57:35.040 --> 57:36.040]  So what do you expect them to do next?
[57:36.040 --> 57:40.000]  I just want to ask you and Mike Adams, what are they going to put, because Mike said just
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  nothing.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  They'll do anything they can.
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.160]  We're going to come right back with Tyler Nixon and Mike Adams, and Mike Adams takes
[57:45.160 --> 57:46.160]  over.
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.040]  I'm going to go to CPAC with live feeds, M4s.
[57:48.040 --> 57:52.440]  Keith Vansomer powers the great line of high quality, swirable food we have available at
[57:52.440 --> 57:54.600]  readyhour at M4store.com.
[57:54.600 --> 57:56.280]  And yes, we're selling swirable food here.
[57:56.280 --> 58:00.040]  What concerns me is we're a month into this and food sales aren't going down.
[58:00.040 --> 58:01.040]  They're going up.
[58:01.040 --> 58:02.720]  You've never seen anything like this.
[58:02.720 --> 58:05.000]  Never, never like this and sustained.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.400]  You know, we started, you know, 27 days ago and it kind of went hyper and it doesn't
[58:09.400 --> 58:10.400]  fall off.
[58:10.400 --> 58:13.720]  And in the even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[58:13.720 --> 58:14.720]  The semis are rolling.
[58:14.720 --> 58:15.720]  The chips are in.
[58:15.720 --> 58:18.440]  We're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[58:18.440 --> 58:20.440]  Orders that are getting in today, they're going to ship.
[58:20.440 --> 58:22.440]  They're going to just ship in 10 to 14 days.
[58:22.440 --> 58:24.200]  We're helping people prepare.
[58:24.200 --> 58:25.800]  It's just something you cover.
[58:25.800 --> 58:26.800]  Absolutely.
[58:26.800 --> 58:27.800]  You like to eat daily.
[58:27.800 --> 58:28.800]  And so we're just backing that up.
[58:28.800 --> 58:30.400]  It's the best insurance out there.
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.960]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[58:34.960 --> 58:38.560]  It's normal to sit on top of horrible food and guns.
[58:38.560 --> 58:39.720]  All our forebears did it.
[58:39.720 --> 58:40.720]  We've got food.
[58:40.720 --> 58:41.720]  We've got guns.
[58:41.720 --> 58:42.720]  We've got Jesus.
[58:42.720 --> 58:43.720]  We know how to use it.
[58:43.720 --> 58:44.920]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[58:44.920 --> 58:45.920]  It's real simple.
[58:45.920 --> 58:49.480]  NOAA prepared.
[58:49.480 --> 58:51.320]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[58:51.320 --> 58:53.160]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[58:53.160 --> 58:56.760]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[58:56.760 --> 58:58.800]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[58:58.800 --> 59:04.520]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.520]  per dollar.
[59:05.520 --> 59:12.280]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund
[59:12.280 --> 59:16.560]  the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[59:16.560 --> 59:17.640]  And so it's very simple.
[59:17.640 --> 59:22.080]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which
[59:22.080 --> 59:27.720]  God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort, 110% God will finish the move.
[59:27.720 --> 59:31.280]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[59:31.280 --> 59:32.280]  I want to attack.
[59:32.280 --> 59:35.560]  I want to go after the globalist and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if
[59:35.560 --> 59:39.040]  you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[59:39.040 --> 59:41.000]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.280]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for
[59:45.280 --> 59:46.280]  your family.
[59:46.280 --> 1:00:04.280]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for you, for your family, for your family.
[1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:33.400]  Well, I mean, let me tell you, it is amazing here at DC.
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:36.680]  All these patriots here in Nigel Rogers have done so much more.
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:40.600]  We were hanging out with him last night, Tyler Nixon.
[1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:45.520]  Other comments about Roger and what he's facing, they were supposed to get rid of Trump and
[1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:50.280]  then convict Roger and then sentence him, but it's all blowing up in their face.
[1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:54.000]  She is just in panic mode right now, trying to suppress the names of the other jurors
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  that we know were handpicked.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:01.080]  Yeah, I just think it's such a poetic justice that Roger Stone's case, given how badly they
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:06.360]  went after him and railroaded him or attempted to railroad him, ultimately, and also the
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:10.840]  fact that he has, Roger is a libertarian, he calls himself a libertine.
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:15.200]  So you mentioned the fact of coming hard after the libertarians worked out.
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:20.880]  I think he represents and as do you, embodies everything that they hate.
[1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:25.120]  It's about truth, it's about the fines of authority, illegitimate authority, it's about
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:26.520]  defending rights.
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:32.760]  These people, they are absolutely just autocratic, megalomaniacal, and totally unhinged now.
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:41.240]  There used to be a nod-wink traditional establishment that has some credibility, it could do things
[1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:42.800]  and act on consensus.
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:47.640]  Now, it's just a flailing, it reminds me of, remember the first movie, Aliens?
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:51.520]  They had that cyborg guy who was kind of an defeat British, and then eventually his head
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:59.160]  pulls off, and he's laying in this thing of milk, and it's like trying to talk.
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:04.000]  When that alien, that cyborg goes berserk, that, I think, is what we're seeing right
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.160]  now in the sort of status left in America.
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:08.800]  That is the best analogy ever.
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:12.960]  They're just totally pre-programmed, they can't help it, and they're carrying out mission.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:13.960]  He's like...
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:14.960]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:15.960]  Literally.
[1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:16.960]  They're like plane-throwing him.
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:17.960]  He's like...
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  You know what I'm talking about.
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:23.760]  Yeah, the head, they're like plane-throwing him, and, you know, Roger, there were dark
[1:02:23.760 --> 1:02:24.760]  days throughout the last year.
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:25.760]  It's kind of fun to do that.
[1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:30.040]  It's like a leftist thing.
[1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:31.040]  There were dark days.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:37.120]  But my Bernie Sanders Pampers on, huge, giant, fat women, wanting Bernie Sanders who says
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  they should stand in the food lines.
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:41.520]  I'm like, go to the Venezuelans, they'll call the Venezuelans starvation diet.
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:42.520]  They're like, F you.
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:43.520]  You know, it says they don't even...
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:44.520]  Sorry.
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:45.520]  No, no, no, no.
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:46.520]  That's great.
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:47.520]  I saw that.
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:49.520]  I saw it on a map.
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:50.520]  What was it?
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:51.520]  I don't know.
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:52.520]  When the woman mooned you.
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:53.520]  The walrus ass, exactly.
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:54.520]  Yeah, what is wrong with these people?
[1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.520]  I'm like, listen, it's okay.
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:03:01.320]  You're a big ass, fat ass, but just you're fat in America, and I guarantee you don't work
[1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:02.320]  a day in your life.
[1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:03.320]  Yeah.
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:04.320]  Go to Venezuela.
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:05.320]  Starve to death.
[1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:06.320]  They don't even listen.
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:07.320]  Like, hey, communism's horrible.
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:08.320]  Like, I'll kill you.
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:09.320]  I want everything.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:10.320]  I'm sorry.
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:13.880]  No, please, go on, brother.
[1:03:13.880 --> 1:03:18.200]  For those not familiar, look up the Manson family and look at the footage of Squeaky
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:20.960]  Frome and Cren Winkle and all that, whoever they were.
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:22.400]  They look just like...
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:23.400]  This is what you're looking at.
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:24.400]  A Bernie rally.
[1:03:24.400 --> 1:03:25.400]  Right.
[1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:29.400]  The eyes, the sort of, they get sort of crazed looking eyes and all like the chanting and
[1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:32.880]  holding hands and like jumping around like lunatics.
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:33.880]  It's like textbook.
[1:03:33.880 --> 1:03:36.880]  I mean, this is the Bernie support base right here.
[1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:37.880]  The Manson family folks.
[1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:41.440]  The scariest part was watching the Bernie managers, all college students like scare their
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:42.440]  own people.
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:46.840]  Like, we love Bernie and now you manage lunatics.
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:47.840]  Yeah.
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:51.520]  Like, you're kind of getting like, our people look like they had lobotomies.
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:53.800]  We might not be in the best club here.
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:57.680]  Oh my God, what the hell is going to happen to this country?
[1:03:57.680 --> 1:04:01.600]  I'm not done laughing at that entire bit that I just heard there.
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:04.200]  That was, these people are lunatics.
[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:08.240]  It's a massive mental insane asylum that the left is running now.
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:09.720]  And they think they understand economics.
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:10.720]  They don't.
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:11.720]  They think they understand the rule of law.
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:12.720]  They don't.
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:13.800]  They think they understand biology.
[1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:17.400]  They don't even think it's real, actually, you know, the, this whole non-binary.
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:18.400]  Exactly.
[1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:19.400]  They say, we're going to give you HIV.
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:21.960]  We're going to realize pedophilia in California.
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:24.320]  They've legalized giving people HIV.
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:27.160]  They're just assaulting reality.
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:32.120]  And wait until the virus invades the feces, filth-ridden city of San Francisco.
[1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  Okay.
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:34.120]  You want a dose of reality?
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.640]  Wait till that day comes because it's not far off.
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:39.160]  Like, you're taking over here, but I want to do five more minutes.
[1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.040]  I want to get Tyler Nixon's take on the virus and yours on this key point.
[1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:44.040]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:45.040]  I'll be gone in five minutes.
[1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:50.880]  You can hear Mike talk, because I know he's the expert on this, in FullWars.com, tomorrow's
[1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:51.880]  news today.
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:53.080]  Do not share the link.
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:55.080]  Do not share in FullWars.com.
[1:04:55.080 --> 1:05:00.200]  All right, folks, here's the bad news.
[1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:04.800]  We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nanotech silver that's
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:08.960]  documented to knock out viruses and bacteria unlike anything else.
[1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:09.960]  Right?
[1:05:09.960 --> 1:05:12.920]  We do still have it in the three ounce and the one ounce for limited time.
[1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:19.200]  The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver toothpaste, both that
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:21.480]  have the nano silver in them as well.
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:27.320]  The super blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:31.040]  And then, of course, the whitening has the nano silver, but on top of that, it has the
[1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:34.720]  above sea coral calcium that remelanorizes the teeth.
[1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:37.840]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find, period.
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:42.080]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out at current rates
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:43.080]  in about two weeks.
[1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:48.720]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves
[1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:50.160]  with this high quality product.
[1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:51.160]  You've never used it before.
[1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:53.160]  Get yours today, infowarstore.com.
[1:05:53.160 --> 1:05:54.160]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:05:54.160 --> 1:06:03.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:08.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:11.640]  Well, I got to tell you, I'm here in D.C. and about to go over to Maryland.
[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.640]  I'm like a dog in a butcher's shop, holding interviews.
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:15.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:16.640]  I don't know if we're right.
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:17.640]  I was talking to Carlson.
[1:06:17.640 --> 1:06:19.520]  I mean, it's all, the planet's aligning here.
[1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:23.280]  We have Rodgers Jones personal lawyer here who's not afraid of the judge.
[1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.320]  He's not getting into the case from the lawyer perspective.
[1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:29.720]  He's a citizen and he's been here, how this is blowing up their face.
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:36.720]  I cannot hype enough how this is Amy Bergen-Jackson who's just screwed the poacher and totally
[1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:39.120]  been caught with her ass hanging out at High Noon.
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:41.080]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:44.960]  But I wanted to just before Mike Adams has a special doctor coming on coronavirus in
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:50.400]  just a moment, get your view, Tyler Nixon, on coronavirus.
[1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:56.120]  It just as an army officer and a lawyer and Rodgers Jones lawyer, just a patriot.
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:06:59.280]  What's your gut level approximation?
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:04.560]  I mean, the way we've just found the Northern California, the first unsourced or quote,
[1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:07.520]  community infection where they can't source where it came from.
[1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:10.120]  There's no, the person had no contact with anybody.
[1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:13.320]  It almost seems like it's being spread versus it's spreading itself.
[1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:18.760]  You know, someone's, this is being introduced in areas and, you know, also the two week
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:24.000]  time frame for the manifestation of any symptoms that that really lends itself like it's been
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.360]  engineered to spread itself before people can detect it.
[1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:33.200]  And I just, it's a bio weapon being used by who knows what parties, but clearly not
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.200]  for good.
[1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:35.440]  And that's why there's fear.
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:36.440]  People know it's a bio.
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:37.440]  Oh, yeah.
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.600]  Fortunately, the mortality rates are still nothing akin to like, say, pandemic, flu
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:49.320]  pandemic, influenza pandemic, like, except exactly this reinfects, though, that's the
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:50.320]  weird wildcard.
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:51.320]  Yeah.
[1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:55.760]  No, it's, it's really just the fact that people, there are people on this planet.
[1:07:55.760 --> 1:08:00.040]  But wouldn't that be the ultimate bio weapon that you don't ever beat it?
[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:01.040]  Yeah.
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:05.920]  Well, they have, I mean, you think about they have, I mean, like herpes simplex, you know,
[1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:10.720]  like these persistent viruses that's maintained, like they're just cause like, you know, minor
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:11.720]  effects.
[1:08:11.720 --> 1:08:12.720]  But I mean, who knows?
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:16.560]  I mean, they can mutate the virus and something like, you know, AIDS instantly, but, but fast
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:17.560]  acting where people dying.
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:19.120]  Well, this has the age delivery system.
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:20.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.120]  That's what I mean.
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:24.920]  It's, you know, I think it's, this is, this is what we're fighting against here is people
[1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:30.120]  in this world who would even think to use technology and science to engineer such.
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:31.120]  Don't you have children?
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:32.120]  Yeah.
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:33.120]  What was your problem?
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:34.120]  It's, that's why it's demonic.
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:35.120]  I mean, it is.
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:37.560]  I think just they don't care whoever it is.
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:38.560]  Well, you know what?
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:42.520]  We can talk about evil all day, but look in the mirror and I say this to myself, we need
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:47.960]  to get control of our governments and prosecute and persecute people that are developing bio
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:48.960]  weapons.
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:49.960]  Mike Adams, don't we?
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  Absolutely do it.
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:54.880]  And by the way, if the same number of people were infected in America with the coronavirus
[1:08:54.880 --> 1:09:01.200]  as are typically infected with the flu, we would have probably 3.5 million deaths in
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:04.200]  America, not just the 35,000 that are killed by the flu.
[1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:07.520]  So the only reason the flu has killed more people so far is because the coronavirus
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:10.280]  spread has only just begun.
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:16.240]  It hasn't even infected 1% of the world population yet and we already have all of these deaths.
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:18.880]  So this has just begun and this is going to go on for years because it's going to keep
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:19.880]  coming back.
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.040]  The CDC has acknowledged it.
[1:09:21.040 --> 1:09:24.280]  All the virologists know that that's how it's working and the mutations are happening.
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:26.960]  It was a mutation that was detected in Iran.
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:30.760]  So we're already getting second and probably third generation versions of this virus.
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:31.760]  Absolutely.
[1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:32.760]  You're about to take over.
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:33.760]  I want to just say this in closing.
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:41.640]  I already sell immune-boosting products X2, X3, DNA4s, Ultra 12, vitamin mineral fusion.
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  Bodies is 40% off and sold out for months.
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:47.640]  Ultimate turmeric formula, 95% of humanoid.
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.960]  No one else we know even has that.
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.920]  We pay to have the lab make it.
[1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:53.200]  It's so good for your immune system, so good for your body.
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:54.200]  Everybody knows that.
[1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:55.200]  Use back at stockinfoorstore.com.
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:56.200]  You help yourself.
[1:09:56.200 --> 1:10:00.640]  You get a great product and you find the info or when they're trying to shut us down, but
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:01.920]  the Lord works mysterious ways.
[1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:08.000]  So take action infoorstore.com or call toll-free, AAA-2533139, but whatever you do for your
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.560]  children, especially, we don't have an elderberry formula because there's so many great ones
[1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:12.560]  out there.
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:18.720]  Elderberry, sunshine, clean water, a good diet, not a lot of grains and things that lower
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:19.720]  your immune.
[1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:20.720]  Not a lot of sugar right now.
[1:10:20.720 --> 1:10:22.720]  Again, I don't follow half this.
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:24.760]  I know the best thing to do.
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:27.640]  Infoorstore.com, that funds this whole thing.
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:28.640]  We're going to let you take over.
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:30.600]  Mike, we really appreciate you.
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:37.120]  I want you to just briefly hear Tyler Nixon arrive, who's a private lawyer, prediction.
[1:10:37.120 --> 1:10:41.280]  The judge says the next two weeks or so, she's going to rule on when he goes to jail.
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:42.280]  Why is she waiting?
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:43.600]  What do you think Trump's going to do?
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:45.320]  Just a few final comments on where you think this is going.
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.040]  Well, I'll tell you, it's taken such a twist.
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:48.200]  I don't know.
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:52.600]  I can't predict, but I think the president will pardon Roger Stone and he has to.
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:55.320]  I do not believe this judge will grant a new trial.
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:56.320]  She would never admit.
[1:10:56.320 --> 1:11:00.640]  Well, she's an arrogant piece of crap that must be checkmated.
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:03.440]  She will never admit to having done anything that was offline.
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:06.840]  And they're telling Trump he doesn't have this power.
[1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:08.360]  He's got to exercise it.
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:09.360]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:15.200]  She better hope that she doesn't think to listen to, frankly, these claims that she
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:19.920]  wouldn't have to accept a pardon because he's been and was exonerated, by the way.
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:21.920]  They're trying to make her the president.
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:22.920]  Yeah.
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:26.600]  They're trying to make her the president because if she can checkmate a pardon.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:27.600]  That's right.
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:28.600]  Yeah.
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:29.600]  She's now the executive.
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:32.920]  Just as they want the House of Representatives alone to be able to eliminate the pardon power.
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:36.440]  If that was the case, the House of Representatives on an opposing party could meet at the beginning
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:39.720]  of a president's term, impeach them for anything they say they want to.
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:40.720]  And that would be it.
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:41.720]  The pardon power did goes away.
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:42.720]  Yeah.
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:43.720]  That's the argument they're making.
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:44.720]  They would geld them.
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:45.720]  Yeah.
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:46.720]  Basically.
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:47.720]  Exactly.
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:48.720]  So the president is elected.
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:49.720]  We chop his balls off.
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:50.720]  Just the House, not even the full Congress.
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:55.040]  I mean, where's their legitimate, that's martial law.
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:59.400]  That's authoritarian dictatorship of the Democrat House and Schiff.
[1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:00.400]  Yeah.
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.400]  Unbelievable.
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.120]  The tyranny now of the majority, but formerly minority.
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.440]  I think the minority, when you look at like average citizens do not want this type of like
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:10.440]  you know what's crazy.
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:12.240]  Autocracy running the world for us.
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:15.840]  We are here not even having to dial this up or exaggerate.
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:17.920]  It's so classically evil.
[1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:18.920]  Yeah.
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:19.920]  So over the top.
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:20.920]  Yeah.
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:21.920]  It's like unspeakable.
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:28.120]  We cannot say how bad it is because it's so ridiculous and runs totally against everything
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:29.120]  America is.
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:30.120]  It's just fantastic.
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:31.120]  It's fantastic.
[1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:32.120]  It's fabulous.
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:35.040]  It's like, it's just unbelievable.
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:41.960]  It's a spectacle of just wanting, like you said, like an alien, the first one when they
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:42.960]  killed the Android.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:46.120]  It's a giant tipper tantrum.
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:47.120]  Yeah.
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:52.960]  It's a manifestation of their delusions basically, but you know, imperfectly so.
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:55.920]  I mean, they want us to live in this reality that it's not a reality.
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:56.920]  It's their fantasy.
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:12:57.920]  It's their delusion.
[1:12:57.920 --> 1:12:58.920]  And they never give up.
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:12:59.920]  No.
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:02.240]  Mike Adams take over, but they just keep dialing it up.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:03.840]  Hey, Tyler Nixon be on with us tomorrow.
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:05.560]  We're going to CPAC right now together.
[1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:06.560]  Great job.
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:07.560]  Tyler Nixon.
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:08.560]  How do people find you on the internet?
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:10.560]  Go to Twitter at TylerPNixon.com.
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:13.480]  Great place to follow Tyler PNixon.
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.080]  Mike Adams take over with your guest, but I'll ask this question at closing.
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:18.080]  You said it earlier.
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:19.080]  It's unlimited.
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:21.240]  There's just, there's nothing they won't do.
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  There's nothing they won't do.
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.640]  There's no amount of life that they are not willing to sacrifice in order to achieve their
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:28.640]  goals.
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:31.960]  But look, thank you, Alex, and thank you, Tyler Nixon, especially for those comments.
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:37.560]  We are shortly going to be joined by Dr. Thomas Levy, who is an ortho molecular, excuse me,
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:42.240]  ortho molecular medicine expert and a clinician, a cardiologist who has a lot of expertise
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:47.800]  in using intravenous vitamin C therapy to eliminate toxins from the blood supply, in
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:53.480]  essence, inducing the body to eliminate toxins through its own processes such as kidney removal
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:56.480]  of those toxins, liver detoxification, and so on.
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.080]  So why is this relevant?
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:05.200]  Because right now the world has no approved drugs for the coronavirus, no approved vaccine,
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:10.580]  not even one in any clinical trial, not that that would even work, who knows.
[1:14:10.580 --> 1:14:16.120]  But there are natural approaches to solving this problem, and in fact, intravenous vitamin
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:22.200]  C has had many reports of early success in hospitals around China, as well as Korea.
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:25.920]  I know it's being experimented with in places like Hong Kong and others.
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:30.480]  So we're going to be joined by Dr. Thomas Levy shortly, in fact, at the top of the
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:37.400]  next break, or the next, excuse me, but I want Dr. Levy's take on something that I'm
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:39.920]  about to explain here in 60 seconds.
[1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:46.920]  The current flowchart of CDC's guidance for testing is found in a new article posted by
[1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:53.000]  Kit Daniels on Infowars.com, CDC faces scrutiny over limited coronavirus testing.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.560]  I have been hammering this point for days.
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:01.400]  The testing protocol from the CDC prohibits the testing of individuals in America who
[1:15:01.400 --> 1:15:08.280]  have acquired this infection from unknown origins, i.e., other asymptomatic individuals
[1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:12.480]  who are carrying the virus and spreading it during the incubation period.
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:15.680]  Notice, you will be tested if you travel to China.
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:20.160]  You will be tested if you've had close contact with a person known to have the illness, but
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:21.240]  that's it.
[1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:25.080]  If you did not travel to China, and you did not acquire it from someone who's known
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:30.520]  to have it, you will not be tested in the United States, except in very rare circumstances.
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:35.240]  And to date, only 445 Americans have been tested by the CDC.
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:36.240]  That's it.
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:40.760]  How can you monitor community outbreaks if you're not even testing for them?
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:44.960]  We're going to get Dr. Levy's take on that, plus intravenous vitamin C therapy when we
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:47.000]  return after this short break.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.280]  This is Infowars.com, Alex Jones' show.
[1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:50.400]  Mike Adams sitting in today.
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:51.400]  Stay with us.
[1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:56.280]  We'll be right back with Dr. Levy and much more.
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.320]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:02.200]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:05.800]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker.
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:09.560]  If you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:14.640]  That's why you need Flash Routers, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:19.480]  Flash Routers uses a virtual private network or VPN to protect your online activity from
[1:16:19.480 --> 1:16:22.240]  hackers, trackers, and large corporations.
[1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:26.080]  And not just one, but all your devices with one out of the box setup.

[1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:59.280]  I'm here with Scott Yousseam, founder of OMGTax.
[1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:04.040]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:09.400]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments, sometimes
[1:17:09.400 --> 1:17:10.400]  in the same day.
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:13.960]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.920]  is known as an offer in compromise.
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:18.200]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:19.800]  Oh, can I ever?
[1:17:19.800 --> 1:17:25.040]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:26.040]  Guess what?
[1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:30.720]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.840]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:41.360]  less, call OMGTax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:51.760]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112.
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:57.160]  That's 800-486-8112.
[1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:02.360]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:06.320]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:07.320]  Yeah.
[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:08.480]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:09.480]  I love women.
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:11.000]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.400]  You may have problems with her.
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:13.680]  You may get a divorce.
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:14.680]  You may whatever.
[1:18:14.680 --> 1:18:18.840]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:19.840]  loved.
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:24.400]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storeable foods, we've got the
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:28.320]  best out there because I want you to get a great result and to come back and get it
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:33.200]  again as a customer and fund our political, spiritual operations against supply and waste.
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:36.320]  So if you want storeable foods and everybody else is sold out and you want them delivered

[1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:45.640]  I got to tell you, the next week or two, I may come out and say, sorry, no more food
[1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:49.120]  sales we've sold out, just like we've done with supplements and other things.
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.000]  So get your orders in now today at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:56.600]  Yourself and your family become independent.
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:18:58.560]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:04.560]  Coronavirus is a man made bio weapon designed to destroy nation states, economies and free
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:08.520]  peoples and usher in a planetary government.
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:10.920]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.120]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:19.720]  Fears of global coronavirus can take in rage as 3,000 cruise ship passengers return home
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:22.960]  and that's just in one nation.
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:27.880]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China that reporting it could
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:32.360]  cut their sales in half this year.
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:35.680]  That's how major this is.
[1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:37.200]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:40.960]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:46.000]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.040]  the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:55.280]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band.video and infowars.com
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:20:00.120]  today.
[1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:13.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:19.920]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:27.520]  Mike Adams, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:31.640]  Mike Adams here, publisher of naturalnews.com, thank you for joining me.
[1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:37.040]  Hosting right now for Alex Jones, infowars.com, we have a very special guest for this segment,
[1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:43.080]  very important person with a body of knowledge that may help save literally millions of lives
[1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:44.440]  across the planet.
[1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:46.360]  His name is Dr. Thomas Levy.
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:51.440]  This is the first time I'm meeting him and I'm honored to have him on and he's a specialist
[1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:53.160]  in ortho molecular medicine.
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:57.560]  He's a cardiologist and he understands the role of intravenous vitamin C in treating
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:00.640]  a number of chronic degenerative health conditions.
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:03.360]  He has clinical experience in these areas.
[1:21:03.360 --> 1:21:08.000]  And while the world waits for a vaccine that may not ever work or may not ever appear,
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.960]  we have many answers that exist right now this very minute.
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:13.440]  So let's welcome Dr. Levy to the show.
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:14.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:16.800]  It's a pleasure to have you on.
[1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:17.800]  My pleasure, Mike.
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:20.360]  It's a great opportunity to talk to the health ranger.
[1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:27.040]  Well, look, I'm an admirer of your work and what you do, your body of knowledge.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:30.440]  Give us the big top-down view first.
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:33.200]  What is intravenous vitamin C therapy?
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:37.680]  What is it being used for right now and how might it have application in this particular
[1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:38.760]  global context?
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:44.160]  Well, it's interesting, although much of mainstream medicine still doesn't seem to
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:50.000]  appreciate this, vitamin C is not some sort of cult type application.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  It has a huge body of scientific data going back to the 1940s, in which case when you
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:04.040]  give large enough amounts of vitamin C intravenously, you're capable of resolving a great deal
[1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:09.520]  of different especially viral syndromes, other types of infections as well.
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:14.920]  But for some reason, vitamin C is especially potent for viruses.
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:20.200]  This is significant because I also want to make the point, I'm not saying vitamin C is
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:21.400]  going to cure everything.
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:27.600]  I'm not making crazy accusations, but it is a fact and it's supported in the scientific
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:33.680]  data that vitamin C is probably the primary ammunition for your immune system.
[1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:38.640]  All the immune cells have far and away the highest concentrations of vitamin C of any
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:40.320]  cells in the body.
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:46.000]  And this is really why a functioning immune system is so effective is because it gets
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.520]  vitamin C where it needs to go.
[1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:55.880]  When your immune system is depleted and you don't have much vitamin C in them, then you're
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:59.880]  subject to a lot of problems with infections, with diseases.
[1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:04.920]  But intravenous vitamin C gets you a large amount of vitamin C where you need it quickly.
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:09.320]  And specifically in the literature, it strengthens the immune system by at least 19 different
[1:23:09.320 --> 1:23:10.840]  mechanisms.
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:17.960]  It increases T cells, B cells, antibody production, natural killer cells interfere on, the list
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:23.840]  goes on and on, and this is not just hearsay, this is solid peer-reviewed research in the
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:26.200]  scientific literature on PubMed.
[1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:31.360]  So interestingly enough, with the problems going on in China, it turns out China is one
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:37.920]  of the world leaders in vitamin C research, particularly IV vitamin C, way back in the
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:38.920]  70s.
[1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:39.920]  Go ahead.
[1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:40.920]  Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Levy.
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:44.280]  Let me ask some questions that I think some viewers might be asking right up front.
[1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:50.960]  So number one, why, what advantage does intravenous have over oral supplementation of vitamin
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:51.960]  C?
[1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:55.600]  You know, why are people not able to absorb it or you can't get the concentration high
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:58.000]  enough in the blood through oral application?
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.640]  What's the explanation there?
[1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:01.640]  That's exactly it.
[1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:03.400]  It's limited absorption.
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:09.520]  Let me say this long before, and even when intravenous vitamin C is not available, many
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:15.840]  people have gotten incredibly positive results with different diseases, but also infections
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:19.680]  when they're persistent in taking oral dosing throughout the day.
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:24.840]  There's also specialty forms of vitamin C, if you will, liposome encapsulated.
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:30.560]  These are highly effective too, and can have a profound impact on arming the cells of vitamin
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:35.480]  C because they deliver vitamin C directly inside the cells of the body.
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:40.200]  But yes, it's all a matter, I used to say, what's the three most important things in
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:41.200]  vitamin C therapy?
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:44.920]  Well, like real estate, it's location, location, location.
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:47.800]  With vitamin C, it's dose, dose, and dose.
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:52.320]  So are you trying to, with intravenous, I'm just curious, are you aiming for a target
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:56.880]  concentration in the blood, a certain number of micrograms per deciliter or something like
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:57.880]  that?
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:01.800]  Do you want to calculate the volume of blood based on a person's weight and then apply the
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:02.800]  dose that way?
[1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:04.600]  I'm just curious.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:10.920]  You can do it that way, but myself and many other vitamin C advocates and users have been
[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:13.040]  using vitamin C for so long.
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:19.760]  We pretty much know what 25,000 milligrams, 50,000 milligrams, even 100,000 milligrams
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:24.320]  is going to give you in blood levels, and really the primary thing you need to watch
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:25.760]  is clinical response.
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:31.280]  When vitamin C is working in an infection, it works very rapidly in terms of symptoms.
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:32.280]  So it's grams.
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:33.280]  Wow.
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:39.280]  I didn't realize it was that large, but people need to be aware too, vitamin C is water soluble,
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:41.120]  your body eliminates it quite quickly.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:44.240]  How quickly does vitamin C actually come out of your body?
[1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:49.160]  If you get the level you want in your blood, isn't that mostly gone in a few hours or you
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:50.160]  know better than I?
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.160]  What's the answer there?
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:52.160]  No, that's correct.
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:58.040]  If you give a 50 gram infusion of vitamin C, most of it will be gone four to five hours
[1:25:58.040 --> 1:26:03.960]  down the road, but you'll have gotten a temporary very high concentration that allows it to
[1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:05.960]  penetrate the cells very effectively.
[1:26:05.960 --> 1:26:11.280]  So the other thing too is we're now starting to see, and they're doing a study in China
[1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:18.240]  where they're giving coronavirus patients 24,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day intravenously,
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.960]  but they're not giving it as a quick bolus, they're giving it as a slow seven hour infusion.
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:28.040]  And I think this will have an even superior effect to giving a quick IV bolus.
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:31.920]  Wouldn't that also then, you have all these other positive side effects from it as well,
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:37.720]  not side effects, but benefits, you would have cardiovascular benefits from such treatment
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:38.720]  as well.
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:42.320]  There's an enormous body of evidence in that arena, isn't there?
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  Yes.
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:49.840]  So the thing is, is all disease is oxidative stress, and how many biomolecules you have
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:50.840]  oxidized.
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:56.400]  The only way you get those biomolecules to function again is to donate electrons, and
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:03.280]  although there were many antioxidants, vitamin C is the premier electron donating antioxidant.
[1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:10.080]  It gives two electrons per molecule, and this is why even though any antioxidant can resolve
[1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:16.520]  an oxidized biomolecule, which is the essence of disease, vitamin C spearheads this.
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:21.240]  It's a small molecule just like glucose gets everywhere in the body, gets across the blood
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:22.520]  brain barrier.
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:29.360]  So the more you can keep your natural biomolecules in the reduced state, the more you will retain
[1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:33.720]  normal function and avoid or help resolve disease.
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.920]  And I would imagine, this is great, by the way, amazing information, be sure to let our
[1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:42.480]  readers, our listeners know where they can find more information about you.
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:48.240]  But I would imagine this is especially useful for the elderly who tend to have a poor assimilation,
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:52.560]  poor digestion, and that's the exact group that tends to be more aggressively hit by
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:53.760]  this virus.
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:58.720]  So if anybody's lives might be potentially saved by this as we conduct more research,
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:00.000]  wouldn't it be the elderly?
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:06.560]  Well, as you know, we live in a very toxin-filled society, and all toxins are pro-oxidant.
[1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:13.720]  All toxins cause their damage by oxidizing or causing biomolecules to be oxidized.
[1:28:13.720 --> 1:28:18.600]  So the older you are, the more toxins you face, the more toxins you have in your body,
[1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:21.560]  the more depleted your immune system is.
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:26.960]  And so, yes, it has a especially dramatic effect in the older folks.
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:30.560]  I want to say something that might seem a little off-subject, but with regard to the
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:37.280]  coronavirus epidemic, there now exists a good body of evidence to show that doing simple
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:44.320]  measures like nebulizing, putting something like hydrogen peroxide 3% into a fine mist
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:45.320]  and inhaling...
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:46.320]  Dr. Levy, hold that thought.
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:47.320]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[1:28:47.320 --> 1:28:51.440]  We're going to break in just a few seconds, but please continue on the other side.
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:52.440]  This is fascinating.
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:54.560]  We're back with Dr. Levy.
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:57.160]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:01.080]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.080 --> 1:29:02.600]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:05.560]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:08.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:11.080]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:12.440]  I can help you, too.
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:15.440]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:17.640]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:26.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:33.160]  Forget bunkers.
[1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:35.160]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:40.040]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off-the-grid mobile survival bug
[1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:44.520]  outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.

[1:29:57.120 --> 1:30:03.200]  A lot of people ask me the M4 war secret, and I'll just tell you, I'm just real.
[1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:08.440]  Now, the problem is, I go back and forth, though, in my mind about where I stand.
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:13.520]  I mean, on basic stuff, like the Second Amendment and family and God, I'm 100%, but you get
[1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:18.400]  to other issues, I start asking myself questions, so I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty
[1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:22.200]  during the middle of this crisis, selling high-quality, storeable food.
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:25.900]  Even though it's prepositioned, I'm right, we're right about being man-made, we're right
[1:30:25.900 --> 1:30:30.000]  about it being super deadly, we're right about being prepared, it still feels weird
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  to be right.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  Isn't that crazy?
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.940]  But you know what, I'm getting past that.
[1:30:34.940 --> 1:30:37.400]  We still have storeable food, we have plenty of it.
[1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:40.000]  The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.800]  Other competitors don't have it, they're lying to you.
[1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:47.000]  Gear orders at an M4 store.com, and you know you're going to get high-quality, storeable
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:51.440]  food, but now it's not two weeks, it's four weeks, folks, we got the food, we got a package
[1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:57.200]  it, get your food today, high-quality, and fund the M4 at M4store.com.
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:30:59.960]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[1:30:59.960 --> 1:31:03.920]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:09.320]  It's very communicable, it spreads very, very fast, it is killing a lot of people, and the
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:13.680]  Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is, and the White House is
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:19.720]  now openly challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist, and so is Senator Cotton.
[1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:23.560]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:26.720]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:30.480]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:33.480]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:36.760]  That's why listeners to M4 Wars need to be prepared.
[1:31:36.760 --> 1:31:42.760]  And M4store.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier.
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:46.560]  We have the last of the immune gargle, selling out as we speak.
[1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:50.920]  We have high-quality, storable foods, ready to ship, and vitamin mineral fusion is back
[1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:57.960]  in stock along with Ultra 12 at M4store.com.
[1:31:57.960 --> 1:31:58.960]  Real stuff, man.
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:01.680]  We're talking about the real deal here, and I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell
[1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:05.760]  you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over him, everybody
[1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:09.960]  oh, I mean, I've got a problem, and we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:13.280]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[1:32:13.280 --> 1:32:19.000]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:23.880]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, M4Wars.com, and
[1:32:23.880 --> 1:32:26.040]  it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:29.880]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without
[1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:30.880]  even disrupting attention.
[1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:32.440]  People say, why are you doing this?
[1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:33.440]  What's happening?
[1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:36.640]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and Trump won't do anything about it.
[1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:39.400]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this
[1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:40.400]  yet.
[1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:41.400]  It's brilliant.
[1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:46.480]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made
[1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:47.920]  it into a weapon.
[1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:50.880]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:56.440]  And you know what's most disturbing to people, silence.
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:19.200]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:33:19.200 --> 1:33:26.280]  It is the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams.
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:31.640]  We're continuing a fascinating interview with Dr. Thomas Levy from peakenergy.com.
[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:33.840]  He's an expert in intravenous vitamin C therapy.
[1:33:33.840 --> 1:33:36.040]  I just want to be clear.
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:43.120]  To the regulators watching this show, we are in no way claiming that vitamin C cures coronavirus.
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:45.680]  We are in no way making, you know, medicinal claims.
[1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:50.440]  In fact, there's nothing in the world that's been tested clinically against coronavirus.
[1:33:50.440 --> 1:33:55.920]  However, there is an enormous body of knowledge about vitamin C and its ability to help the
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:04.020]  body heal, to detoxify, to reduce the oxidation states, as Dr. Levy was just describing.
[1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:10.280]  And shouldn't we consider all medicine when we come to saving lives?
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:16.280]  Why should we wait for the vaccine industry when there are other possible therapies right
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:20.840]  now that can be investigated and that may be able to help save millions of lives right
[1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:21.840]  now?
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:23.360]  And that's what we're talking about with Dr. Levy.
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:27.720]  So again, Dr. Thomas Levy from peakenergy.com.
[1:34:27.720 --> 1:34:30.760]  I apologize for interrupting you in the last segment there, Dr. Levy.
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:32.200]  Please, please continue.
[1:34:32.200 --> 1:34:34.160]  You are onto something really interesting.
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:37.000]  Well, I want to add to your point right there.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  You're absolutely correct.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:42.640]  I don't want anybody to think I'm saying take vitamin C and you'll be cured.
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:47.960]  But I will say take vitamin C and you will give an incredible increase in strength to
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:48.960]  your immune system.
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:54.160]  And isn't that what anybody wants if they're dealing with any type of infection?
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:58.920]  Now what I was mentioned earlier is, to best of my knowledge, all viral syndromes, virtually
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:04.400]  all viral syndromes, come in through the portal of the nose and the mouth.
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:09.880]  And then they replicate to high titers on the mucous membranes of your nasopharynx and
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:11.520]  your oropharynx.
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:17.120]  So it makes a great deal of sense, and I've already seen a great deal of positive response
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:22.920]  to other viruses, that when you're taking vitamin C and whatever else you want to strengthen
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:28.880]  your immune system to deal with the virus that's already in your body, causing your influenza,
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:34.520]  causing your coronavirus syndrome, it makes a lot of sense to cut the head off of the
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:35.520]  snake.
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:42.720]  By that I mean you can nebulize, which is inhaling a fine mist when you take something
[1:35:42.720 --> 1:35:50.920]  simple like 3% hydrogen peroxide and inhale it, you can quickly knock down and virtually
[1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:56.800]  eliminate the large amount of virus that's replicating in your throat and eliminate the
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:35:58.840]  new seeding to the rest of the body.
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:00.800]  I say it's like cutting the head off the snake.
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:06.880]  So it's always good to have a two-fold approach, stop the new virus from coming in while eliminating
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:08.400]  their old virus.
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:12.640]  And for people that say hydrogen peroxide, well hydrogen peroxide is one of the most
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:19.560]  well-known and well-established and least toxic agents there is in the right concentration
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:22.800]  and it kills pathogens on contact of all varieties.
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:27.400]  That's why you put it on an infected wound and you get quick resolution of the wound.
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.920]  So you could use something as simple as an essential oil diffuser, you put in a low concentration
[1:36:32.920 --> 1:36:36.680]  of hydrogen peroxide, you mentioned 3%, obviously people need to be careful if it's too high
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:40.520]  you could cause some oxidation damage of your skin, right?
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:45.640]  So keep it low and you can inhale that, that's what you're describing, it's that simple,
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:46.640]  right?
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:50.160]  Absolutely, but I'd be careful with the oil-based substances, those are a different ball of
[1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:53.920]  wax, the hydrogen peroxide quickly does its job and goes away.
[1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:57.840]  Right now we're just talking about hydrogen peroxide basically with water is typically
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:04.800]  what's sold, yeah you wouldn't want to inhale volatile organic oils from plants, but it's
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:09.760]  nice to have that scent perhaps, it might be very pleasing.
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:14.400]  Okay, so another technical question for you, so is it ascorbic acid?
[1:37:14.400 --> 1:37:19.200]  Is that the form that you're putting in intravenously or is it a slightly different form of the
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:20.200]  molecule?
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:28.480]  Well the essence is ascorbate which is the anion, hydrogen is a cation so that's ascorbic
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:34.240]  acid then you have sodium as a cation, sodium ascorbate, sodium ascorbate is probably the
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:41.240]  best to use because it comes in in solution closest to a very non-aggravating and well-tolerated
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:47.240]  pH of 7, 7.1, 7.2 with 7.4 being ideal.
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:52.700]  A ascorbic acid in solution always has to be further buffered to make the acid part
[1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:53.860]  less alkaline.
[1:37:53.860 --> 1:37:57.320]  And is sodium the buffer that you typically use in your formulations or are you using
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:00.920]  a different mineral choice?
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:05.760]  My favorite and it's based on my experience and on the literature is sodium ascorbate
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:06.760]  yes.
[1:38:06.760 --> 1:38:07.760]  Okay, alright that's great.
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:12.200]  I hope you don't mind me asking these technical questions because I'm very curious about this
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:16.920]  too and I think that, well I mean my next question is where could people get this therapy
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:21.960]  because their regular doctor let's say may not have any experience or any training in
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:22.960]  this area.
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:25.880]  Where do people go to even explore this possibility?
[1:38:25.880 --> 1:38:32.400]  Well, if the intravenous is not available you need to go to taking high doses orally
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:36.480]  and if possible get the liposome encapsulated form.
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:43.000]  With regard to the nebulization as of this time for $40 or $50 you buy a nebulizer online
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  at Amazon.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.800]  They got a little chamber, you put the hydrogen peroxide and a little water if you wanted more
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:52.120]  dilute in that chamber and inhale away.
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:58.720]  So it's, now I don't know if 100,000 people order all at once we might have a shortage
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:01.640]  on nebulizers like we have a shortage on food supplies.
[1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:06.800]  Well plus the nebulizers are all made in China so the supply is probably pretty limited at
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:12.360]  this point but yeah you can get those nebulizers in many places probably even like in Walmart
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  has it right now.
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:20.160]  But let me say this, this could give you, if you're blocked at all areas you can't get
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:26.520]  the IVC you take a lot of oral and if you can't nebulize the hydrogen peroxide by a
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:32.840]  little mister like when you spray perfume on the skin you put hydrogen peroxide in there,
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:36.680]  open your mouth and try to coat the back of your throat as best as you can.
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:41.280]  That will also knock down the viral load and allow whatever else you're doing to have a
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:46.880]  much more powerful effect at resolving the virus and ultimately of course keeping you
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:48.040]  from dying from it.
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:55.360]  Okay, wow, great advice, really practical advice, low cost, low tech, almost like prepper level
[1:39:55.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  emergency medicine that you can explore, I do want to just say that of course we are
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:05.800]  not offering you the listener specific medical advice, talk with your naturopath or your
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.560]  complementary medicine doctor, make sure that you are caring for your own particular
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:12.080]  health concern.
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:14.920]  But consider these options, that's why we have Dr. Levy on.
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:19.360]  These are options, when the government fails you as it is doing everywhere around the world
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  right now the CDC can't even make diagnostic test kits that even work, okay.
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.520]  So the government is not your savior.
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:29.400]  The vaccine industry is not your savior, you need to learn about these alternatives.
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:31.440]  Let's go back to Dr. Levy.
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:37.680]  Now are there any other minerals that are maybe complementary to this such as zinc for
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:38.680]  example?
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:44.640]  Do you offer clinically or recommend clinically that goes well with this?
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:50.320]  Certainly as an anti-infection protocol the zinc is very important, also magnesium in
[1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:58.400]  a bioavailable form, vitamin D3 is very potent in not only preventing infections but helping
[1:40:58.400 --> 1:41:05.680]  to resolve them and taking different forms of iodine and sometimes too the iodine can
[1:41:05.680 --> 1:41:09.600]  be nebulized too along with the other things that we're talking about.
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:11.320]  So all those things are important.
[1:41:11.320 --> 1:41:16.920]  I would just say that the more antioxidant support you can take by supplementation the
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:23.360]  better but there are so many out there I just like to tell people I consider the most powerful
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:31.600]  and important supplements to be magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D3, vitamin K2 and iodine
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:36.600]  often in time, often in the form of something like iotirol, many, many, many other things
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:43.000]  are powerful and good but I think all supplementation regimens should at least include those five.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:49.240]  Well that's really great advice, very important advice in this time when if you think about
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:54.200]  right now the people who are infected with coronavirus according to media reports about
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:57.000]  four out of five people have mild symptoms.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.960]  So that means four out of five people are recovering on their own, they do not go into
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:03.640]  the serious classification where your survival rate plummets.
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:10.120]  If you can stay out of that serious classification you may with perhaps with some of these natural
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:15.960]  therapies you might be able to have a 95 percent chance of survival or even a 99 percent.
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:20.640]  We don't know yet, we're just taking educated guesses but you don't have to be killed by
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:21.640]  this.
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:25.200]  It really doesn't kill most people it infects, most people survive but how do we increase
[1:42:25.200 --> 1:42:26.360]  that number?
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:28.240]  That's what we're talking about with Dr. Lieber.
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:33.080]  We'll have more thoughts with Dr. Thomas Levy on the other side of this, excuse me, he's
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:38.040]  from peakenergy.com and this is the Alex Jones show, Mike Adams, we'll be right back after
[1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:45.000]  this break with more Dr. Thomas, Levy, about vitamin C, minerals and other natural protocols
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:55.800]  for boosting your immune function.
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:43:00.440]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high quality, storeable food we sell at mfoolwarestore.com
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:04.480]  but everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high quality at a great price
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:09.560]  because I treat you like I want to be treated, it is my religion, the golden rule.
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:15.600]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, my patriot, is now three
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:19.360]  to four weeks out before they ship food, they have the food but they've got to package it
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:24.040]  and any day now they may come and tell me, oh sorry we're not selling food anymore because
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:26.880]  they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:31.400]  Now you get your order in now, you get the high quality food, it's a smart move, it funds
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:36.280]  the M4, you can't lose, take action at mfoolwarestore.com, whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:40.480]  weeks, six weeks, a three month, a six month a year, special diets, they've got it all
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:44.400]  at mfoolwarestore.com, they're in our back end, we're partnered with them, they'll ship
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:49.200]  it out to you the day it's packaged, they've got the food but they are days and days behind
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:53.600]  shipping it out so get your order in now to lock it in and it funds the M4 or 360 went,
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:54.600]  mfoolwarestore.com.
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:44:00.920]  We know that the globalists are in trouble, humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how
[1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:05.840]  they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world but
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:10.920]  we know they're going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to absolutely
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:16.840]  implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes
[1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:22.040]  to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and
[1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:27.760]  pivot program. The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:34.280]  world government inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a critical time
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:40.200]  to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:46.080]  but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about band.video and
[1:44:46.080 --> 1:44:53.040]  mfoolwars.com forward slash show that is so important. You are at the center of the resistance.
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:56.880]  You are our only hope.
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:02.600]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements. Ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:08.920]  back in stock after being sold out for months. Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins,
[1:45:08.920 --> 1:45:14.440]  minerals, amino acids and other key co-factors that are so good for you and your family especially
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:21.520]  your children's bodies and your immune systems. Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:26.240]  taken sublingually under the tongue. It is back in stock. You can get them both individually
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:34.640]  for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off. This makes your life
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:39.580]  so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a
[1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:47.640]  tasty fruit punch and of course vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina,

[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:00.920]  It is wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we are
[1:46:00.920 --> 1:46:06.120]  seeing record food sales not just here but across the world. That is good. People need
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:12.680]  to be self-sufficient. The average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:17.400]  and doesn't even know how to change their tire. We need to reverse this trend and start
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:22.400]  getting prepared and that means even with just the basics, even a three week food supply
[1:46:22.400 --> 1:46:27.520]  that you know is always there that you only go to in emergencies. That said, boosting
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:32.880]  your immune system is just as critical or even more so and things like DNA force plus

[1:47:00.080 --> 1:47:05.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:16.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:19.960]  he. It's Mike Adams.
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:27.840]  And we're back on the Alex Jones show. Mike Adams filling in here while Alex is well at
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:31.800]  the CPAC conference area interviewing a lot of interesting guests. For just the next few
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:35.880]  minutes, we're going to wrap up our interview with Dr. Thomas Levy, who's an expert in
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:40.000]  ortho molecular medicine, intravenous vitamin C. And I've been asking a lot of technical
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  questions just because personally, I'm curious and I want you, the viewer, as you process
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:51.920]  all of this information, I want it to be very practical for you because for all we know,
[1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:58.120]  I mean, it's possible society may break down to the point where there's never antiviral
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:04.360]  medications. I mean, 97% of antibiotics are made in China. And as China's supply chain
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:08.760]  is cratering, there are going to be shortages of prescription drugs in the United States.
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:14.000]  So if you ever needed a new reason to have alternatives to prescription drugs, this is
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  it, folks.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.280]  This is why we have to have experts like Dr. Levy on here. So continuing Dr. Levy, another
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:25.080]  question I have for you. If taken orally, you mentioned the buffered form sodium ascorbate
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:29.560]  is what you use intravenously. Some people take that orally as well. What do you recommend
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:35.160]  orally as the best form of vitamin C? Or does it depend on how well a person handles the
[1:48:35.160 --> 1:48:39.160]  acidity of ascorbic acid? What's your take?
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:50.440]  Dr. Levy? Is he hearing me? Oh, he's frozen. Okay. All right. I thought he was pondering
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:56.080]  the question there. No, okay, we'll reconnect with Dr. Levy. He cut out there. My question
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:01.120]  was about what form of vitamin C works best. We'll get him back on and finish up that interview.
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:06.200]  Until then, let me give you some other breaking news updates. Coronavirus live updates Japan
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:12.360]  to close all schools through March. We have President Trump now insisting that America
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:18.520]  is ready for the coronavirus, which I believe is what I'm calling the Trump trap. I think
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:24.600]  the CDC is setting a trap for the president because once the testing is allowed to take
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:28.880]  place, then I believe we are going to see this was my personal opinion. I can't prove
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:33.960]  it yet. We're going to see hundreds, if not thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:40.160]  in the United States. That's my belief based on projections, based on the sources and based
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:46.200]  on the fact that we are not testing. The CDC is only testing about 16 people a day. That's
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:51.280]  it. Only 445 people have been tested in the entire country. How can the CDC claim to have
[1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:58.080]  any surveillance whatsoever of community outbreaks if they're not testing for community outbreaks?
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:02.800]  In fact, I've been trying to hammer this point for days and a lot of people don't get it.
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:09.040]  You know who really gets this? Let me just mention this. Infowars.com, of course, is
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:13.160]  the tip of the spear here. But I just got to give a shout out. Zero Hedge is covering
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:17.160]  this really well. Chris Martinson over at Peak Prosperity is doing a great job. I've
[1:50:17.160 --> 1:50:21.640]  been listening to his analysis as well. He's got a science background. Of course, my own
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:26.320]  coverage. A lot of people appreciate that. I've got Pandemic.News is kind of a new hub
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:33.560]  site where we are listing, later today, we're listing state by state, the number of infections,
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:37.840]  the number of people tested, and the number of people quarantined on a state by state
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.520]  basis. I don't think anyone's put that together yet. I had my team do that research starting
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:49.400]  last night. And we have links to all 50 public health departments for each of the states.
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:54.520]  And I can tell you right now, what's shocking about these numbers is they're mostly zero
[1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:59.720]  tested, zero, zero, zero, state after state after state. That's coming. We'll have that
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:05.640]  posted at the latest tonight. Okay, Australia has started an emergency plan, extends the
[1:51:05.640 --> 1:51:12.240]  travel ban amid coronavirus pandemic fears. And we have a quote from the Australian Prime
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:17.480]  Minister Scott Morrison. That's a little bit mind blowing here. Quote, there is every indication
[1:51:17.480 --> 1:51:23.920]  that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus as a result. And
[1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:29.760]  again, this is this was the PM of Australia. As a result, we have initiated the implementation
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:35.600]  of the coronavirus emergency response plan. While the WHO is yet to declare the nature
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:41.120]  of the coronavirus and its move toward a pandemic phase, ie, the WHO doesn't know what they're
[1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:46.760]  talking about. We believe that the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us. And
[1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:52.360]  as a result, as a government, we need to take steps to prepare. Yeah. Hey, wow, the PM of
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:58.520]  Australia makes perfect sense. It's the WHO. That's in total denial here. They said yesterday.
[1:51:58.520 --> 1:52:03.960]  Okay, we're going to Thomas, Dr. Levy here in just a second. It was yesterday, the WHO
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:10.040]  said, we're not going to use the word pandemic, because it sounds too scary to people. So
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:15.200]  what is this the politically correct version of the global pandemic now where we have to
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:20.560]  coddle people's emotions instead of telling them the truth? I mean, they declared a pandemic
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:25.560]  when there was not one with the bird flu a few years ago, they were so quick. Oh, it's
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:31.640]  a phase six pandemic, billions of dollars for vaccines. But now when the real thing
[1:52:31.640 --> 1:52:35.120]  breaks out, they're like, let's not call it a pandemic because that might freak people
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:40.440]  out. Okay, continuing with Dr. Levy. I was asking, I don't know if you heard the question,
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:45.320]  but what form of vitamin C do you recommend for oral consumption? Is it the buffered
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:50.280]  form or non buffered? What's what's your take? Well, actually, the sodium ascorbate
[1:52:50.280 --> 1:52:56.240]  is a buffered form because it doesn't upset the stomach. Calcium ascorbate is also used.
[1:52:56.240 --> 1:53:01.000]  I don't recommend that because I think most people have too much calcium. I wrote a book
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:06.200]  called death by calcium that addresses this. The best form of vitamin C to take orally,
[1:53:06.200 --> 1:53:12.280]  if it's available to you as a quality, liposome encapsulated form. I've been consulted to
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:18.440]  a company for 14 or 15 years, and only because they had the best product I've ever seen.
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:24.600]  Let's live on laboratories. Other products can give you liposomes, but there's a lot
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:29.560]  of fraud in the liposome industry. So I have no confidence in other companies because of
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:36.720]  that. What does the liposomal encapsulation achieve? Explain that to our viewers. Well,
[1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:42.520]  very good. What it does is, even though you take it orally, you're in tiny 100 to 200
[1:53:42.520 --> 1:53:50.200]  nanometer bulbs, globes, which are actually like tiny, tiny, tiny artificial cells. They
[1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:55.720]  pass into the body without any problem at all, and they go into the limb, and they arm
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:54:01.160]  the immune system. They go out of the limb into the bloodstream, and then they go directly
[1:54:01.160 --> 1:54:08.240]  into the cells passing through pores or merging with the outside membrane by a process called
[1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:14.400]  reverse pyrnocytosis. But the important thing is, is you get delivery of virtually the entire
[1:54:14.400 --> 1:54:20.160]  amount of vitamin C you take inside your cells, even though you take it orally, and without
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:25.080]  the consumption of energy. All the other forms of vitamin C, you need to consume energy to
[1:54:25.080 --> 1:54:31.960]  get it from the blood to go inside the cell. So that gives it a very powerful impact. And
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:37.240]  we've observed some very, I've observed some very powerful effects of quality liposomes
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:43.080]  above and beyond just regular vitamin C. But nobody should be upset if they can't get a
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:48.560]  hold of it. You take your sodium ascorbate powder three or four times a day, work yourself
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:52.800]  up to your maximal dose. You'll know you're at your maximal dose if you start causing
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:54.760]  a little bit of loose stool and diarrhea.
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:57.680]  You know, what's interesting, we're about to wrap this up, and I want to thank you for
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:04.760]  joining us. Your website is peakenergy.com, just like how it sounds, peakenergy.com.
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:10.920]  Lots of the raw material of ascorbic acid today is made in China. You know, they synthesize
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:16.560]  it there at very large quantities, and they have buffered forms, of course, as well.
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:21.040]  I remember when we, a couple years ago, we were trying to source non-China vitamin C,
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:27.520]  it was almost impossible. We finally found a source out of the UK. But my goodness, if
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:33.400]  the world needs vitamin C and China's shut down, could we, this is my question to you,
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:40.280]  could we be facing somehow vitamin C shortage, even though it's a very low-cost material,
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:42.080]  could this be in short supply?
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:51.120]  Well, from my perspective, that's almost as scary to me as the idea of a pandemic itself
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:56.320]  is being deprived of what I consider to be the single most important protective agent
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:01.240]  you have against infection, and the single most important agent you have toward helping
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:10.400]  to resolve infection. So that would be a super-based scenario, in my opinion, and gosh, I don't
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.560]  have a lot of positive suggestions to make other than, you know, all the other supplements
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:20.280]  you can take, all of those provide antioxidant capacity, having as quality of diet as you
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:26.280]  can, doing all the measures like cleaning your hands, not touching your face, and of
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:32.280]  course, the hydrogen peroxide. I've seen that work very well, sometimes on an acute
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:37.320]  viral syndrome, even without having to kick in the vitamin C into high gear. So I wouldn't
[1:56:37.320 --> 1:56:39.800]  underestimate that potential intervention.
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:45.800]  Well, that's fascinating. So killing viruses with oxygen, enhancing the immune function
[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:51.440]  with vitamin C, you know, I've read that 25% of your genetic code is actually built to
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:57.520]  save your life from pathogens, but most people's genetic code is not really active because they
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:03.440]  don't have the nutritional compounds and just the nutrition and the minerals in order for
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:07.920]  that part of their immune system to function. So this is very valuable information. Dr.
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:13.440]  Levy, I hope you'll join us again. It's been a pleasure to speak with you today.
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:14.440]  My pleasure, Mike.
[1:57:14.440 --> 1:57:18.680]  Well, thank you so much. peakenergy.com is his website. Now we're going to come back
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:23.080]  with Alan keys. And he wanted to ask me a question and then he's going to take over
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:27.680]  this show after that. But I don't know what he's got in mind. He's got some kind of brain
[1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:31.600]  teaser for me or something on the other side of this break. We'll find out Alan keys is
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  standing by Dr. Thomas Levy. Again, was our guest for these couple of segments. This is
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:47.320]  Mike Adams, the health ranger info wars.com. We'll be back with Alan keys. Stay with us.
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:53.160]  This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:59.920]  out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen
[1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:06.320]  to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is. And then your support
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:12.800]  of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic. My friends,
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:18.640]  I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen fluorides, the bad halogen.
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:23.520]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:30.800]  I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:36.560]  We've got it back in stock X2 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you

[1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:51.880]  lose unless you don't take action. I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family
[1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:57.040]  of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air. And I spent a lot
[1:58:57.040 --> 1:59:01.480]  of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the
[1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:05.440]  air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:11.880]  reveres. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products
[1:59:11.880 --> 1:59:16.280]  are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:21.200]  out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're
[1:59:21.200 --> 1:59:26.200]  going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting
[1:59:26.200 --> 1:59:34.440]  the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support info wars. It really is something
[1:59:34.440 --> 1:59:40.280]  that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and

[1:59:45.160 --> 2:00:08.600]  today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. All right, now we're joined by Alan keys.
[2:00:08.600 --> 2:00:12.240]  And I'm going to turn over the whole show to Alan here first. He's taken over. We've
[2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:18.600]  had a fascinating day already. Just a whirlwind of bombshell information and practical information
[2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:25.760]  that can help you save your own life potentially as this global pandemic continues to spread.
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:29.040]  Alan keys. It's a pleasure to have you on again. And I understand you had a question
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:33.160]  for me today that I don't know what that is, but welcome to the show. Well, it's a question.
[2:00:33.160 --> 2:00:37.600]  It should be right up your alley. Well, thank you. I'm glad to be here. I want to say hello
[2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:45.160]  to everybody. I'll be back for an hour today. And we'll be talking about some other possible
[2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:49.800]  ways to help people fortify their health in a present environment where things are getting
[2:00:49.800 --> 2:00:55.760]  a little iffy. But I was reading an article at zero hedge, right? And I think they've
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:59.840]  been doing some pretty good reporting about this. They're very skeptical, of course, of
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:07.680]  the notion that it's not this virus is not something man made. And in commenting on it,
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:14.760]  they actually talked about some of the things that have been speculated. And he said in
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:21.040]  a sentence, as a reminder, the running narrative is that the new coronavirus lay dormant in
[2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:27.040]  bats somewhere between 20 and 70 years, then crossed over to humans through an unknown
[2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:33.320]  species before it emerged at a Wuhan China meat market, roughly 900 feet from a level
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:42.520]  four bio weapons lab. And aside from the slightly facetious note there, I was kind of curious
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:47.760]  about the statement that it laid dormant, right? Because it immediately occurred to
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:52.360]  me that that late dormant part, wouldn't that be something that if you were trying to weaponize
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:59.320]  a virus, you might be interested in understanding how you get the virus to lay dormant for
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:05.000]  a while. And if you could manipulate that, you could turn it into an even more treacherous
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:12.080]  attack on an opponent. Is that just idle speculation? Or would that be something to look into?
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:16.120]  Yeah, actually, you've nailed something that I didn't even have time to talk about. It's
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:23.960]  the binary weapon aspect of this. When you combine 5g, 5g wireless, which the electromagnetic
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:29.200]  fields, once they interact with your skin, it produces what are called, I believe, what
[2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:34.680]  peroxynitrites in your body. And it causes what are called ion gated calcium channels,
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:40.480]  which is a calcium poisoning of your cells due to the excess voltage. This is not ionizing
[2:02:40.480 --> 2:02:47.080]  radiation, but it's excess voltage from 5g. So isn't it interesting that in Wuhan, they
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:53.640]  have 5g technology from Huawei at the same time they have this virus escaping? Is it
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:59.440]  possible? I guess I'm asking you another question, but is it possible that it's the convergence
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.560]  of these two things that makes it so dangerous to people? I don't know the answer to that.
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:09.480]  I'm not claiming there's a 5g conspiracy to weaponize the virus. But when we're dealing
[2:03:09.480 --> 2:03:15.360]  with multiple vectors, you can have toxicity or compromise immune function from many different
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:19.480]  angles, and it seems like humanity is now in the midst of this toxic cocktail of mass
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:24.080]  poisoning through electromagnetic exposure as well as viruses and chemical exposure
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:29.760]  and hormone disruptors. It's a cocktail. Well, see, I find that everybody's being discouraged
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:34.560]  from doing conspiracy thinking. And yet the advances in our technology are offering people
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:39.760]  weapons possibilities. What ran across my mind as just a speculative thought was that
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:44.840]  you would look into the possibility of being able to create a virus that would lay dormant
[2:03:44.840 --> 2:03:49.440]  until it was triggered by something. Yes. So that you could actually infiltrate a country
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:53.800]  to such a degree that once you triggered it, you might be able to wipe out a good part
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:59.240]  of its population. So you'd have something that was quietly as effective as nuking them
[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.600]  out that they wouldn't know about till it hit them. And that's one of those thoughts that
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:09.880]  crossed my mind. And I said, whoa, we are in a strange age. You're not out of line at
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:14.920]  all. In fact, humans coexist with many thousands of different viral strains, most of which
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:19.680]  are harmless. But when the immune function is sufficiently weakened, then latent viruses
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:24.400]  in your own body emerge and start to replicate and take over. This can happen with something
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:30.320]  as simple as herpes or chickenpox or hepatitis A or hepatitis C. So yeah, I mean, what you're
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:35.840]  saying is absolutely true. Could it be weaponized? For sure. But this virus, I think, is hitting
[2:04:35.840 --> 2:04:41.240]  us just now. It's not waiting for anything. That's right. It's not. But if they were looking
[2:04:41.240 --> 2:04:46.320]  to do something like that and they didn't take proper precautions, maybe they were
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:50.360]  hoist by their own petard. Who knows? Anyway, we are going to have to take a break and then
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:56.600]  we'll be right back to continue this kind of discussion. It's really smart to get high
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:01.840]  quality, storeable food at infowarestore.com. It's also smart to drink filtered water with

[2:05:51.320 --> 2:06:12.040]  use your DNA Force Plus today at infowarestore.com. Welcome back. Well, I have my good friend Bob
[2:06:12.040 --> 2:06:18.400]  Sisson with me again today. And we are going to be following up on the kind of mentality
[2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:23.920]  that was at work in Mike Adams presentation because you're we're living in a world that
[2:06:23.920 --> 2:06:29.680]  now is posing obviously a threat that's focused on the coronavirus. But we've also we all
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:35.880]  of us know that on account of various and assorted changes in the human environment,
[2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:41.960]  because of our technology, because of things that are being done by the health industries,
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:48.400]  the pharmaceutical industry, all of these people, there are a proliferating number of ways in
[2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:53.440]  which our body is being subject to various kinds of attack from the environment in which
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.440]  we live. All these folks out there worried about what's happening to the earth and so
[2:06:57.440 --> 2:07:01.960]  forth and so on. And meanwhile, don't seem to be quite as interested in paying attention
[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:07.600]  to what is happening to us in terms of this organism being subjected to all kinds of stresses
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:12.680]  and strains and attacks that we weren't used to in the course of the days before we had
[2:07:12.680 --> 2:07:17.520]  these massive technological advances. We'll be talking about one of those today with a
[2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:22.760]  good friend of ours, Mark Greenin, who is coming on as our guest to talk about something
[2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:30.360]  that is actually like you were just hearing with vitamin C, a way of using or unleashing
[2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:36.040]  natural mechanisms that helped the body to fortify itself against various dangers that
[2:07:36.040 --> 2:07:40.960]  have then to be dealt with by the immune system and other aspects of the body, but that are
[2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:47.360]  actually like cleansers that help to both clean and eliminate various toxic things,
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:52.640]  but at the same time, prepare the body better to live in an environment that is as constantly
[2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:57.640]  dangerous as the one we now find ourselves in. So I'm going to turn it over to Bob,
[2:07:57.640 --> 2:08:01.640]  so you can introduce Mark a little better. All right. And then we can get into discussing
[2:08:01.640 --> 2:08:07.760]  with him something that Bob and I have been working on together in various ways, and he
[2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:10.720]  has been in the forefront of for the last several years.
[2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:14.920]  Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Dr. Case. Yeah, we have Mark Greenin and one of his
[2:08:14.920 --> 2:08:19.440]  sons. I'm thinking it's John. I'm not for sure who we got out there, Mark.
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:20.440]  Joseph.
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:22.160]  Joseph. Okay. I'm sorry.
[2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:23.160]  Joseph.
[2:08:23.160 --> 2:08:24.160]  Yeah.
[2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:30.800]  Okay. You have several sons and I can't keep up with them all. Welcome to the show, guys.
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:38.960]  Mark Greenin is a friend of mine. Dr. Case and I met up with him last summer in Denver,
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:43.600]  and we learned about chlorine dioxide and what it does. Of course, I'd already known
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:49.840]  I've been using this in Uganda for many years, and there's a lot of neat stuff, but Mark,
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:54.960]  if you want to open it up and tell us a little bit about what is chlorine dioxide and how
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:59.280]  does it work in the body? And we got a whole hour, so we're going to get a lot of information
[2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:05.760]  out today. Sure. Sure. I just want to say thank you for having us on 11 years ago. Joe
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:11.240]  and I were praying in Santa Domingo that one day we'd be able to get on the Alex Jones
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:19.920]  show and tell them, tell them about what we've found. And through another man, there was
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:26.720]  a minor and it's a really crazy story. But let me tell you, first of all, I just want
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:31.360]  to thank Alex Jones, for his stand. And I love what I just heard him say, Mike Adams
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:39.880]  also in Allen. Great. I'm glad Alex has had you on and you're a very smart man, probably
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:45.760]  a lot smarter than me. So Bob, I don't know so much about, but I hope you're talking to
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:55.400]  Allen. No, but we're good friends. And what's cool is we all know the Lord. We all are asking
[2:09:55.400 --> 2:10:03.560]  God's help and God put this together. So quickly, just a real quick overview. I found this as
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:09.040]  a missionary pilot in the Dominican Republic in Haiti, working with medical teams. All
[2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:14.920]  my family ended up working with medical teams. And we got this MRSA, the staff infection
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:21.840]  from the hospitals. I was working in surgery. Joe is interpreting in surgery. We had a regular
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:27.160]  pharmacy in our house as missionaries helping a lot of people. Well, we couldn't cure our
[2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:33.320]  MRSA. They wanted to cut off my other son's leg because of the MRSA. So I frantically
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:38.160]  got on the Internet and found a book by a guy and I laughed at first and just pushed
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:43.920]  to the side called Miracle Mineral Supplement by a guy named Jim Humble. I figured, well,
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:49.520]  it's Miracle. The guy's name Humble. This can't be true. So I just pushed this side.
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:53.840]  A couple of weeks later, I was pushed back to it through the Internet and he offered
[2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:59.480]  his book at first half for free. I read it and I'm like, wow, this makes sense. Make
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:05.200]  alarms through his short. I got the MMS. This is what he called it, Miracle Mineral Solution.
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:10.920]  And I got the activator. I made it in my home. I didn't want to give it to my kids in case
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:18.600]  it killed me. I'd be the sacrificial lamb, I guess. And so I cared myself within three
[2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:25.240]  weeks. Never came back to this day. Joe and my other children, all eight of them, my wife
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:30.360]  never got it, but my other eight children did. All of my eight children did. It took
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:34.720]  about a year or so later because by the time of the year before it got rid of the break
[2:11:34.720 --> 2:11:37.280]  up. Do you have it today? No, I've been killed.
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:43.880]  Okay. So that set us on a journey to start praying and asking God to help us in Dominican
[2:11:43.880 --> 2:11:50.200]  Republic. Didn't know Jim Humble from Adam's house cat. Had no idea. I wrote him and thanked
[2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:55.560]  him for finding it and he wrote me back and we kind of corresponded. But for three years,
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:12:02.400]  from 2006 to 2009, we were using it all over Haiti, Dominican Republic, curing diabetes,
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:08.720]  HIV, dengue fever, cancers, stroke symptoms. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.360]  Hold on a second. You are telling me that all the things you just listed, you were using
[2:12:13.360 --> 2:12:20.480]  this MMS and it was actually having effects to get rid of all of these various things
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:25.400]  you talk about. Yes, sir. And the reason why we even attempted
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:30.800]  to try other things is because in Jim's book, he was in Africa trying things and he ended
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:37.480]  up just curing malaria 100% of the time in a day. Next day, they were fine. And that's
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:42.800]  a parasite. That's not a virus. So he said what happened was the cancer patients were
[2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:49.080]  getting cured and the diabetes patients, HIV, and he's going, what is this? This is crazy.
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:53.200]  And then he wrote a book and I got the book and I'm going to say, Joe, let's try it here
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:59.280]  for other things. And they were getting healed. I'm using the word healed like in the Bible,
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:06.120]  literally healed. We call restored health cure. Hello. Well, I just wanted to back up
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:13.840]  what you're saying because I've been using this in Uganda for since 2011. I originally
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:19.600]  went to Uganda in 1991. 20 years I stayed here working as a plumber, supporting people
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:26.480]  over there doing things. And I went back in 2011. I used to just take it on the airplane
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:31.040]  with me, told the folks in Knoxville it was water treatment, which it is. And I took it
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:38.280]  over there and found that what you're saying is absolutely true. And this last year, I
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:44.640]  took Dr. Allen and Bob from the studio and we went to Uganda and we treated 2000 people
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:50.040]  in three days. And we actually went during the during the dry season because we were
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:56.360]  going to redo the malaria test that the Red Cross did. By the way, you can go to go to
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:08.000]  YouTube, do Red Cross, Malaria, MMS and Uganda. And you'll see a test that was done in 2012
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:13.440]  where the Red Cross tested it and cured a lot of people and they tried to cover it up.
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:18.360]  Now, when you say cure, make it clear what you mean about the malaria. This is just about
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:24.400]  malaria. I mean, it kills malaria. In our case, we knew how to do it. We tested it. It
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:31.000]  killed malaria in two hours. What that means is that the parasite is found there. And after
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:36.800]  two hours or so, absolutely, it is gone. Now, that that original test, it took a day. They
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:41.720]  would take a day. They went back the next day. When we were over there, we were doing
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:48.240]  the same thing. And within two hours, the parasite was gone. And we'll talk a little
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.080]  bit when we get back over the break, because this is really amazing. I mean, the first
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:57.760]  time I was listening to this, I was like you, Mark. I was thinking, wow, you know, this
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:03.520]  can't be. And so forth and so on. And then I read Jim Humble's account of what happened
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:09.520]  with him, right? And how folks had taken it. And the next day, they were up and around.
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:13.960]  Suppose they had malaria and then it was gone. And so you read it and you say, well, I can't.
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:18.000]  That doesn't make it. Because the whole world would be all over this, right? Especially
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:22.640]  in Africa where you have all this malaria. It's the number one killer in the history
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:28.720]  of the world. It's killed billions of people killed. Now, we have to, we'll get into this
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:35.960]  because this is the remarkable attention getter that I think seems to be lost on so many people
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:40.040]  in the world. We have to ask ourselves, why is it lost? We'll get into all of those questions.
[2:15:40.040 --> 2:15:44.280]  And I know a lot of you out there might be skeptical, but you just take a careful listen
[2:15:44.280 --> 2:15:55.760]  right after we get back. Finally, there's a way for you to get into

[2:18:50.400 --> 2:18:59.000]  go. Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:02.800]  long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:07.140]  shot over him, everybody. I mean, I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump
[2:19:07.140 --> 2:19:10.640]  rallies over. That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:15.880]  launched yet. We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different
[2:19:15.880 --> 2:19:20.600]  stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:24.560]  infowarstore.com. And it looks like duct tape. It's just a regular sticker. You put it over
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:28.680]  your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:31.840]  things. People say, why are you doing this? What's happening? Well, you go, well, we're
[2:19:31.840 --> 2:19:36.120]  being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennik, let me just ask
[2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:40.280]  you what you think, because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the
[2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:45.720]  very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon
[2:19:45.720 --> 2:19:51.640]  that you have the loudest sound of all, silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:19:51.640 --> 2:20:21.120]  Silence. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back.
[2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:29.520]  Now, we have been talking about MMS or chlorine dioxide. And I want to get back to Mark and
[2:20:29.520 --> 2:20:36.860]  see if you could help folks understand a little bit, because I know that the word miracle
[2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:42.880]  occurs in there somewhere. And people often are a little suspicious of that word. We use
[2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:47.760]  it a lot with respect to all kinds of things in our sciences and, of course, in our various
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:52.760]  and assorted faiths, especially the miracles worked by Christ and so forth. But we're talking
[2:20:52.760 --> 2:20:58.960]  about something that actually has a fairly straightforward history, first of practical
[2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:04.680]  use as a disinfectant. Chlorine dioxide is used among other things to purify water and
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:09.880]  it's used in hospitals and other places to put on surfaces that need to be cleaned in
[2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:15.720]  areas where people might be served food and other things like this might occur. So there
[2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:21.240]  is an empirical explanation. And I wonder if you could share with people a little bit,
[2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:27.680]  Mark. What is happening when taken in the right way and in the right dosage? Chlorine
[2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:33.080]  dioxide goes to work internally helping to cleanse the body. What's going on?
[2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:42.440]  Okay. So let me just say that MMS is sodium chloride with a T. It's like salt, sodium
[2:21:42.440 --> 2:21:48.760]  chloride, very similar. Okay. And when you mix it with an acid, in this case, we use
[2:21:48.760 --> 2:21:54.360]  the same acid that's in your stomach at 4% hydrochloric acid. It turns into chlorine
[2:21:54.360 --> 2:22:03.120]  dioxide. Now, Sir Humphrey Davies in 1811 discovered how to make chlorine dioxide. And
[2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:10.040]  so it's been around, what's that, 200 and something years now? It's been around 299,
[2:22:10.040 --> 2:22:17.640]  19 years, 9 years, and yeah, 209 years. Bob's a mathematician because he's a plumber. But
[2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:27.120]  listen, so now there's over, Jim says 100,000 patents. I've found 30,000 patents for chlorine
[2:22:27.120 --> 2:22:32.160]  dioxide. And to even get the approval for a patent, you have to, in least in theory,
[2:22:32.160 --> 2:22:37.680]  prove that it works. And many of them are medical applications for chlorine dioxide.
[2:22:37.680 --> 2:22:43.680]  Like you said, they use it in hospitals. They use it in the anthrax scare, the tent, the
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:49.000]  whole building, kill the anthrax. They use it to Katrina disaster to kill all the black
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:56.360]  mold in the houses by tending the houses. They use it in gymnasium, purification, cans.
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:00.280]  All the cans are sprayed with that, so nothing will grow before they can.
[2:23:00.280 --> 2:23:04.880]  The chlorine dioxide gas is used to kill MRSA in locker rooms. In locker rooms? Yes. Meat
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:10.160]  packing plants. We used to sell chicken in Dominican Republic in 80 and that we could
[2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:14.520]  smell the chlorine dioxide. They spray all the chickens and you don't have to wash it
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:21.760]  off because it's non-toxic. It turns into sodium chloride. Sodium chloride. So we've
[2:23:21.760 --> 2:23:27.040]  seen... I would also like to mention, if you don't mind me interrupting for a second, that
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:33.400]  Carrie Rivera at CarrieRivera.com has a great interview that she did with Stephanie Seneff,
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:40.360]  the MIT scientist, where she shows that it not only destroys glyphosate, which is a major
[2:23:40.360 --> 2:23:46.520]  issue today, but it converts it into three elements that your body needs. So you can't
[2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:50.960]  get any better than that. It kills the stuff that's trying to kill us and it makes it help
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:51.960]  us. Praise the lord.
[2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:56.400]  But I think it's really important to give people a sense of what's going on because
[2:23:56.400 --> 2:24:01.800]  we know that in the world out there, it has various and assorted uses that are not in
[2:24:01.800 --> 2:24:08.160]  any way toxic. You can inhale and so forth and so on. But we're talking about actually
[2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:13.160]  taking it. It was just like on the segment that Mike Adams did where you're injecting
[2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:17.720]  vitamin C in a certain form. So it's being used internally. What is actually going on
[2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:18.720]  in the body?
[2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:24.720]  Okay. So when you ingest chlorine dioxide and they put it in water and you ingest the
[2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:31.760]  water, they're already doing it as a government level. It's EPA approved. It's FDA approved.
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:36.560]  So when you when it goes in your mouth, what it does, it's an oxidizer. And this is where
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:43.840]  people think oxidation is just throwing oxygen at something. No, it's a voltage in oxygen
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:50.920]  as a voltage of 1.3 volts. So when it's in the body, that voltage that oxidizer called
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:59.520]  oxygen will go and make electrons come. It's an electron receiver from pathogens. Now,
[2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:06.160]  if oxygen doesn't hurt good things in your body, so how can chlorine dioxide? Well, it
[2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:13.640]  can't because it's only 0.95 volts. It's not strong enough. If oxygen can't kill or hurt
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:20.440]  something good, we definitely can't with chlorine dioxide. But the cool thing is all the pathogens,
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:27.880]  the viruses, the bacteria, the funguses, 99% of them have a potential where they have to
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:34.360]  give up electrons. They have a voltage potential of less than chlorine dioxide. That's why
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:40.880]  they have to give electrons to the chlorine dioxide and they die. And that's just so.
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:50.040]  It's physics. God set this up. So now, isn't there a video like quantumleap.is that explains
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:55.080]  a lot of this and also has a lot of testimonies. And then speaking of testimonies, don't you
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:26:01.240]  have somewhere where our viewers and our listeners can go to to see a lot of testimonies? We
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:07.560]  have thousands and thousands of testimonies of people who have been gotten better using
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:14.320]  this. Sure. We think millions have been taking it around the world and have tried it. And
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:19.240]  we know just in the water, people have tried it, but the government putting it in there.
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:27.120]  Now, what we do is we every week, we put out a newsletter called the G2churchnews.org.
[2:26:27.120 --> 2:26:31.800]  And we put out a free newsletter. And every week I have 10 testimonies coming in from
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:36.760]  around the world and that's been going on for years. And so we have it in Spanish and
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:42.520]  English and we've done 63 seminars now around the world. So there's a lot and we're getting
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:48.240]  attacked. Just ask Alan. He mentions us and he gets attacked, you know, because he was
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:52.760]  a former ambassador and they attack him. What are you doing with this cult? Well, if we
[2:26:52.760 --> 2:26:58.280]  were a cult, we wouldn't tell you how to make this in your own home. You don't even have
[2:26:58.280 --> 2:27:03.400]  to talk to us. We'll show you how to make it free on videos. We'll show you how to take
[2:27:03.400 --> 2:27:10.040]  it free on videos. And you can do that. We want you to practice self care. This is a Bible
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:16.040]  verse that I want to just mention just before you talk. It's it's found in 1 Corinthians
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:21.400]  3. This is our verse that we follow. Know you not that you are the temple of God and
[2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:26.960]  that the spirit of God dwelleth in you. If any man defile the temple of God, him shall
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:32.760]  God destroy for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are. And we want to clean
[2:27:32.760 --> 2:27:39.080]  out the temple by detoxing. And guess what? When you do that and build up the body systems,
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:46.000]  stop toxins from coming in. It starts working like God intended. Yeah, then God himself,
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:51.160]  that's what we say you detox your body properly. And then God himself comes along and heals
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:57.520]  you. Praise the Lord. Hey, I have your book here. A world imagine a world without disease.
[2:27:57.520 --> 2:28:06.480]  You can get that on Genesis to church dot I is to church books. We have a special site
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:13.120]  G to church books dot org. This is the first volume. That's the second volume. And this
[2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:19.840]  is more about why your body's in a disease state. There's not many diseases, folks. There's
[2:28:19.840 --> 2:28:25.040]  there's only one disease. It's in the state of disease, your body or it's not. Now, 100
[2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:31.360]  years ago, there were only 12 listed diseases and only about 100. Well, let's get a little
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:35.360]  bit further into that. We're coming up on a break here. But I just want people to realize
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:40.160]  that you're listening to this, that this is something that is aimed at making your body
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:45.440]  stronger by eliminating things that are putting pressure on your health. That's all it is.

[2:29:56.600 --> 2:30:02.240]  toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told
[2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:05.200]  Alex. I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are
[2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:08.800]  you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people. So
[2:30:08.800 --> 2:30:14.680]  here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:19.280]  ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's
[2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:23.920]  fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[2:30:23.920 --> 2:30:28.880]  because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that
[2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:33.600]  I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good.
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:39.160]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[2:30:39.160 --> 2:30:44.200]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I
[2:30:44.200 --> 2:31:00.520]  like the way it feels. There can no longer be any doubt. This coronavirus is serious
[2:31:00.520 --> 2:31:05.920]  on multiple levels. It's very communicable. It spreads very, very fast. It is killing
[2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:10.600]  a lot of people and the Chinese communist government has covered up just how bad it
[2:31:10.600 --> 2:31:15.880]  is and the Lighthouse is now openly challenging them show our Trump's top scientist and so
[2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:23.280]  is Senator Cotton. My friends, now is the time to get prepared. 2020 is not a year to
[2:31:23.280 --> 2:31:28.800]  play games with the globalist are trying to create economic collapse race riots. We don't
[2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:33.760]  know how bad this virus is going to get here. That's why listeners to info wars need to
[2:31:33.760 --> 2:31:41.320]  be prepared and infowarstore.com has the products that make your life better and make you healthier.
[2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:45.760]  We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we speak. We have high quality storeable
[2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:55.080]  foods ready to ship and vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock along with ultra 12 at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:55.080 --> 2:31:59.480]  Keith Bansamer powers the great line of high quality, swirble food we have available at
[2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:04.080]  ready hour at infowarstore.com. And yes, we're selling swirble food here. What concerns me
[2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:07.920]  is we're a month into this and food sales aren't going down. They're going up. You've
[2:32:07.920 --> 2:32:12.960]  never seen anything like this. Never, never like this and sustained. You know, it started
[2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:17.560]  you know, 27 days ago and it kind of went hyper and it doesn't fall off. And in the
[2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:22.680]  even recent days, you know, it's further increasing. The semis are rolling. The chips are in.
[2:32:22.680 --> 2:32:26.840]  We're producing as much as quickly as possible. Orders that are getting in today, they're
[2:32:26.840 --> 2:32:31.240]  going to ship. They're going to ship in 10 to 14 days. We're helping people prepare.
[2:32:31.240 --> 2:32:35.440]  It's just something you cover. Absolutely. You like to eat daily and so we're just backing
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:39.640]  that up. It's the best insurance out there. You can get food today that you can eat 10
[2:32:39.640 --> 2:32:45.760]  years from now at today's prices. It's normal to sit on top swirble food and guns. All our
[2:32:45.760 --> 2:32:50.240]  forebears did it. We've got food. We've got guns. We've got Jesus. We know how to use
[2:32:50.240 --> 2:32:58.560]  it. We've got a phrase around here, Alex. It's real simple. Noah prepared. You're listening
[2:32:58.560 --> 2:33:15.800]  to the Alex Jones show. We're back. I want to take a little minute. I'm going to ask
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:20.760]  Bob to go into his experience with this because a lot of times you will hear folks talking
[2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:25.680]  about things like this and they're out there and in the world we live in now, especially
[2:33:25.680 --> 2:33:29.480]  when it has to do with anything that has to do with the health. Everybody's looking to
[2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:33.520]  make a billion dollars and take over this and take over that and so forth and so on.
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:37.120]  The remarkable thing, and that's one of those things that has really attracted my attention
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:43.600]  to all of this, is that when you get into the cost factor of MMS, it's a remarkable
[2:33:43.600 --> 2:33:50.000]  story that promises to bring something that can really fortify health within the reach
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  of poorer people, poorest people in fact, throughout the world. What does that look
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:59.880]  like when you start to go through it? Well, I just wanted to, I want to share with
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:07.520]  y'all. We've been using this in Uganda for a long time and when we needed to resupply,
[2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:13.520]  I got on the alababa and got over it. I ordered some out of China. It turns out, I'm probably
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:19.560]  the largest user of it for something like this that there is on the planet. I order
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:23.760]  it by the ton. Everybody else gets it in these little bottles. I think that's why God set
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:28.560]  me in this chair today to talk to y'all. But the reality is, if we buy this in bulk and
[2:34:28.560 --> 2:34:32.360]  I ordered some again last night, because I think the price is going to go up, we're going
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:36.800]  to show you people out there in just a minute that you can make your own, you can distribute
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:43.480]  it to your whole area. I made 400 bottles of this three weekends ago, another 400 bottles
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:51.440]  two weekends ago and I was using 40 pounds of sodium chloride and that's with a T. Now,
[2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:58.200]  if you buy this by the ton, like I could out of China at one point, I can fill this bottle
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:03.320]  and Mark's probably don't want me to hear this, but it for seven pennies, I can fill
[2:35:03.320 --> 2:35:07.880]  this bottle right here. A lot cheaper than the bottle cost, I might add. And this would
[2:35:07.880 --> 2:35:13.880]  last a young couple in America more than a year if they were taking it at an accelerated
[2:35:13.880 --> 2:35:17.600]  rate. When you talk about how easy it is to make
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:26.600]  though, I went over to Uganda and participated in a few days when we had folks coming in from
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:33.320]  different places, some of the poorer areas that you can imagine, folks who have a hard
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:39.240]  time even getting hold of water and things like this. Right. Right. And how many pennies
[2:35:39.240 --> 2:35:50.520]  a day or pennies per dose? Oh, well, we calculated that buying in bulk, you can cure 800 people,
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:56.320]  not cure, but you can treat 800 people with malaria for $1, 800 for a dollar. Now, this
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:02.040]  on a continent where malaria is one of those things that is holding back the ability to
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:06.680]  develop the potential of human beings throughout the continent. And you would jump at a chance
[2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:09.640]  to try to find out. And the thing that bothers me about what's
[2:36:09.640 --> 2:36:14.240]  going on in the so-called health sector these days is if they can't figure out some way
[2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:18.240]  to make billions of dollars off of it, they don't want to pay attention. And yet there
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:23.720]  are poor people suffering all around the world who could really do with an inexpensive way
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:29.000]  to try to strengthen the body in order either to avoid or help to deal with the things that
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:32.800]  will be constantly attacking it in our present environment. I just wanted to go into that
[2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:37.160]  because I think this is remarkable. And so then you go over there and you can actually
[2:36:37.160 --> 2:36:43.360]  help people in bulk, right? By a means that you can share, they can make it at home. Well,
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:49.240]  yeah. And Mark, please forgive me for a minute, but I really wanted to get this out because
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:54.360]  Melania Trump has been mistreated by people over here horribly. And I'm ashamed of our
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:59.800]  people the way they act. But you know, she's has an interest in helping the people of Africa.
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:05.000]  And I was going to ask President Trump, if he would allow us with her blessing to go
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:12.360]  over there, we can put this in Uganda. Everybody lives in these little mud huts, maybe 15 feet
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:17.560]  around with a fat spruce on it. But we can put this in every one of those mud huts in
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:24.880]  all of Uganda for $400 million sounds like a lot. And that's at $2 figuring distribution
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:30.920]  costs labeling whatever, that's at $2, 200 million of these. And that should about do
[2:37:30.920 --> 2:37:38.400]  it 1.2 billion people. So the challenge is now for President Trump to make this happen.
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:44.240]  Melania would then be the most famous person woman on the planet. I have to I have to take
[2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:48.840]  advantage of this moment to make sure that we don't have people coming down on Bob. I
[2:37:48.840 --> 2:37:52.720]  know what people are like these days. And he just said, you know, everybody living in
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:57.120]  mud huts, everybody in Uganda does not live in mud huts. We know this. It's just all
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:02.880]  of the folks that Bob is working with. You understand now you understand what this man
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:08.520]  is about. And he's not about making money or doing any of that. He's about going to
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:13.120]  the poorest of the poor and doing something as Christ would have his heart do to help
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:19.200]  out. And I think you all have been pretty much motivated in the same vein at Genesis
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:23.600]  2. Isn't that right, Mark? Yes, 10 years ago, we started the church with
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:28.440]  Jim Mabel. He came and lived with us for three years. And we told him what we've been doing.
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:33.040]  He's been showing us what he's been doing. And we just took off and started this Genesis
[2:38:33.040 --> 2:38:38.400]  2 church of health and healing. I was a missionary pilot. So I was already working with medical
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:43.960]  teams. They couldn't help. We'd be the Mercer. I saw the MMS did and I started using it for
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:49.480]  other things. So we just started a church, Genesis 2 church of health and healing. Anybody's
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:54.400]  welcome. Anybody. You don't even have to become a member for us to help you. We want you to
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:39:00.640]  know how to do this. Practice self care, get this stuff and make it yourself. If you can't
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:05.720]  look at we even have a thing where you can take on the plane now. Okay, a travel kit
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:09.880]  that well, you can take right on the plane for people that are traveling. But we tell
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:15.400]  people make it yourself if you have to. Most people won't. So you've got to have it available.
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:20.960]  And the reason why I was telling you about that verse is the disease state of the body
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:25.960]  is caused by toxins through the food, through the medication, through the air, through the
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:30.400]  bad water, through the clothing, the things we breathe, the things we're taking in our
[2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:37.440]  mouth. And what chlorine dioxide does, it takes all those toxins out and heavy metals
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:44.240]  and the fungus and kills the cancer and the bad bacteria and the bad viruses because there
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:53.000]  are good ones and the parasites. And so it's a selective oxidizer. It's so simple to do.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:57.800]  And you could take it in your water bottle. You can carry it with you. Now, let me tell
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:04.600]  you about this. The viruses we've dealt with, because this is the topic of the day, is Ebola.
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:10.040]  We cured it in Sierra Leone, cured it. I'm going to use that word as a church, because
[2:40:10.040 --> 2:40:14.960]  these preachers in the streets on the, I mean, not in the streets of the campaign say, in
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:20.840]  Jesus' name, you're healed. You're cured. So I could say cured. He armor church. Okay.
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:25.680]  And we did that with Ebola. We did that with dengue. These are viruses. We did that with
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:32.560]  Zika. We did that with chicken. Goon. Yeah. And the outbreak in Dominican Republic, Chagas.
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:38.680]  Those are all viruses. And the Ebola is amazing. You hemorrhage everywhere. Nothing like this.
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:44.880]  This Corona virus flew on the back of the Clorox bottle. Not to be confused. Clorox is
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:51.400]  not this, but it is a chlorine. It says it will cure Corona virus. There's a patent for
[2:40:51.400 --> 2:40:57.480]  a chlorine dioxide to cure Corona virus also. So it's already been proven, folks, that it
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:02.120]  can cure this. You don't have to, I don't get worried about this. I told Bob and Bob
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:08.000]  said to me, we'll go to a hospital without mask. Let us go in there and treat everybody
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:12.720]  in the hospital. I'll be taking the doses. Guaranteed. I'll be having a bottle right
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:18.600]  here. Maybe a little spraying stronger, but I'll be, I'll do that to prove to the world
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:23.400]  that this will kill the Corona virus. Well, one of the things that I think is important
[2:41:23.400 --> 2:41:27.760]  for people to realize we're, we're not selling anything here and we're not trying to convince
[2:41:27.760 --> 2:41:35.120]  you of something because we think and believe that people need to investigate for themselves.
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:38.760]  But what I will say to you is you need to take a look at those. You need to be thinking
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:45.280]  about it. You need to be reading the material on it. And when you have digested the facts,
[2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:50.080]  you can come to a conclusion about what you think it's capable of. That's what I did.
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:55.560]  It's why I went over with Bob. It's why I have been taking MMS myself. And I think that
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:00.920]  this is remarkable, not so much for me, but for the implications in a world where they're
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:05.840]  telling us that everything must cost billions upon billions upon billions of dollars. It
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:11.720]  appears that God has provided us with a path that is available to people who don't have
[2:42:11.720 --> 2:42:17.640]  those billions. And if we were investing ourselves in making sure people got the knowledge about
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:23.200]  this, that knowledge would now help them to go a long way toward better health in the
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:27.760]  environments in which they now have to live because of our technology, but also because
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:32.840]  of things that have plagued mankind for a long time. We're going to continue. We can
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:55.000]  wipe out disease after this message.
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:42:58.200]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long,
[2:42:58.200 --> 2:43:01.920]  but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot
[2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:07.000]  over and everybody, I mean, I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:10.760]  That said, about two months ago, I came with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:16.040]  a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:20.880]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowars.com.
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:24.080]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth,
[2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:27.680]  you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:30.840]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening when you go? Well, we're being
[2:43:30.840 --> 2:43:34.720]  censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Buchanig, I'm going to just
[2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:39.120]  ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant. You've taken the
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:44.960]  very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:50.720]  You have the loudest sound of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[2:43:50.720 --> 2:43:53.640]  Silence. Silence.

[2:46:58.040 --> 2:47:13.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:20.680]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:27.400]  the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:47:27.400 --> 2:47:34.200]  you are the resistance. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:34.200 --> 2:47:44.400]  Welcome back. No, Alex Jones hasn't, you know, made a drastic change in his looks.
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:51.720]  You got to make a little crazier. I'm Alan Keyes. And though in many ways, if you listen
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:56.880]  to me, I think I probably resemble Alex Jones a little bit, we certainly act from the same
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:48:00.680]  sense that I was there, bowing the words with that wonderful quotation from Thomas
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:05.840]  Jefferson, which, by the way, is in the rotunda. And the Jefferson Memorial, you can go look
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:12.320]  at it. And it's one of those sentiments that I certainly share. And it's what Alex Jones
[2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:17.920]  and InfoWars and I and others who are trying to just share information, get people to think
[2:48:17.920 --> 2:48:23.760]  about things clearly, because in point of fact, tyranny over the mind is not that you
[2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:27.920]  they want you to stop using it. They just want you to use it in the way they tell you
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:33.440]  for the things they tell you, rather than in the way God expected for the things that
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:38.520]  are actually going to help benefit and preserve you and all mankind. If you are just willing
[2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:44.480]  to follow the path he has laid out for this very good thinking instrument that we have.
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:47.520]  And so if you're willing to use your mind in the right way, you can come to the right
[2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:52.120]  inclusion. And I think that what we're talking about here today on the show is one of those
[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:57.600]  things. Now, we have said repeatedly, Mark, that this is something that it's easy for
[2:48:57.600 --> 2:49:04.600]  people to do. It's kind of not only learn it for yourself, but test it out for yourself.
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:12.100]  Can you give just quickly run through the simple process by which if they had this combination
[2:49:12.100 --> 2:49:19.360]  of bottles right here with MMS and HCL, they would actually be able to prepare, for example,
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:25.280]  a little test dose for themselves. Okay, just so people know, you'll add one drop
[2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:31.800]  of this with one drop of this MMS in the activator. You wait 30 seconds. You see it turn in amber.
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:36.760]  You add three out four ounces of water. And that's your first dose. We treat every illness
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:43.080]  on earth. We start the same way as it gets more involved. We may be back down. But that's
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:49.000]  as simple as that. Now, I want to say this, the Corona virus, I would take six drops of
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:54.240]  this, six drops of this in four ounces of water after it activated. And I take that
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:59.720]  every two hours for the first day, four times the next day, four times, and you'll probably
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:04.360]  kick it out. But let me wait a minute. As you're going through this, I want to try a
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:08.560]  little test because every time I watch these commercials on TV, they go through and they
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:12.080]  show the sunshiney people and all the wonderful things they're going to be able to do after
[2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:16.600]  you take X, Y or Z. And then they give you it right at the end. They give you a long
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:23.200]  list of possible side effects, including death. Would you mind doing the equivalent of that?
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:28.160]  If people do this with the right dosage in the right way, what kind of side effects can
[2:50:28.160 --> 2:50:31.560]  they expect? But 13 years, I've been having people come
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:37.480]  to us 30 days at a time. Okay. And we see all the side effects you can imagine from
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:43.040]  people with tumors like this to, you know, just internal things. The worst side effects
[2:50:43.040 --> 2:50:48.360]  because we don't let it get any worse than this is little diarrhea. And in fact, when
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.800]  we see loose bowels, we tell them to break down, back down. Why? Because if you start
[2:50:53.800 --> 2:50:57.960]  detoxing quickly, you're going to have runs and bodies going to start kicking out these
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:04.880]  toxins. If you go too fast, you get die off or healing crisis. It's also called herxamine
[2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:10.200]  reaction. So you just back down. And that's it. That's maybe a little headache, maybe
[2:51:10.200 --> 2:51:15.240]  a little stomach ache. If you're going too fast, you back down, it goes away. Even stop
[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:20.640]  for a day and start again, half a drop, a drop an hour, and you work up. The most people
[2:51:20.640 --> 2:51:27.120]  do and this is fourth stage cancer people. The most they do is three drops an hour with
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:32.800]  some other things we might add. And that's it to cure their cancer. It might take a year
[2:51:32.800 --> 2:51:37.960]  if they've been growing something for a couple years, or it might take a few months. If it's
[2:51:37.960 --> 2:51:43.960]  diabetes, it'd be less. If it's HIV, it'd be less time. I have to make sure that you're
[2:51:43.960 --> 2:51:49.480]  wait, you're actually saying that with a regimen such as you described, you have had people
[2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:54.960]  who have been relieved of these. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And we've had thousands. You can
[2:51:54.960 --> 2:52:01.560]  go to MMS testimonials dot co. You could see thousands. It's categorized. We have it in
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:08.560]  Spanish to on Iglesa Hennessey's dose.org. So we have it in Spanish. But I have to do
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:14.440]  this, Alan. Give me two minutes. I mean, two seconds. I'd be amiss not to mention Jim
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:19.160]  Humble, a hero that it really this is not that this is the book you want to get. You
[2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:24.240]  don't want to get his first book because it's so out of date. MMS health recovery guidebook
[2:52:24.240 --> 2:52:32.040]  by Jim Humble. And this is the Bible. You know, I don't say thing that word lightly,
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:36.480]  but Bible means book. This is the MMS Bible. It'll tell you how to give it to kids, the
[2:52:36.480 --> 2:52:42.400]  dogs and everything. The books I have, I really think people should have them also because
[2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:47.960]  I would really like Alex to read this book and talk about why we have disease on the
[2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:53.080]  earth, and then the history of what we've been doing in the second volume. And I'm not
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:52:58.880]  I give up way the first ebook for free. So if you don't want to buy the whole book, you
[2:52:58.880 --> 2:53:03.920]  don't have to. But I want them to see, look, read this. And if you want the rest of it,
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:08.760]  you get it. Yeah, it's even got the protocols. And we have the protocols on video also to
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:13.880]  tell you exactly step by step how to do it from starting procedure protocol 1000. We
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:18.760]  have them named differently. But all of them are there free on the internet for anybody
[2:53:18.760 --> 2:53:22.920]  who has the MMS, they can go ahead and do these protocols and detox and they can cure
[2:53:22.920 --> 2:53:27.800]  themselves from all these different diseases because we have hundreds of testimonies. Yeah,
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:33.640]  hundreds, thousands. Okay, and the thing that thing is right. So so tell us again exactly
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:38.080]  what website to go to to get the ebook because we have a lot of people that want to see that
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:48.200]  yeah, G to church books.org. We've been thrown off. That's just a number two number two. Yes,
[2:53:48.200 --> 2:53:53.320]  G to church books. We were thrown off. Have to Alan mentioned about the two hour thing
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:53:59.640]  that we paid for back in last year. We were thrown off YouTube millions of views, millions
[2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:06.000]  on our testimonies. They took us off. Google even wrote an algorithm against us. They own
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:12.280]  YouTube. We've been hit by the papers. Every seminar we go to, they try to show up and
[2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:17.240]  break up our church service. Even in England, they did it to us. We threw them out because
[2:54:17.240 --> 2:54:24.480]  we're a church. Now, you can also go Genesis to church.is is where you can find a link
[2:54:24.480 --> 2:54:31.040]  to everything. Our weekly newsletter, the documentary. Well, and you know that this
[2:54:31.040 --> 2:54:37.000]  is why we're using Mike Adams is bright the on now. We encourage everybody to get to bright
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:44.120]  the on forget YouTube. And I got a caution for all the people. These big tech people
[2:54:44.120 --> 2:54:49.080]  that are messing with God's people. I'm going to warn you guys not a lot of times either.
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:54.840]  You better be careful because God is now stepping in on behalf of his people. And this is going
[2:54:54.840 --> 2:55:00.320]  to get it's going to be a situation where God comes along. He put President Trump in
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:06.520]  office and and he put Melania there, obviously. And when you attack these people that God
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:13.040]  put in, including Alex Jones and a shout out to Alex, he presents the gospel very clearly
[2:55:13.040 --> 2:55:19.480]  choose this day and you will serve. It's either God or the devil. And you got two choices.
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:25.160]  Choose wisely because your eternity depends on it. But anyway, be careful because everybody
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:30.120]  that attacks God's people is really attacking God. It's not Alex Jones or President Trump.
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:35.640]  They don't like it's God himself that people don't like. And that's about as dumb as it
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:39.800]  gets trying to attack God. So that's just a little warning for all our friends out there
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:44.080]  that are trying to shut us down. There's going to be a time coming really soon when
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:50.840]  everybody realizes that the living God intends to help everybody. One of the things that
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:53.960]  I think we always have to keep in mind when we're thinking about all these attacks because
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:58.800]  we have been attacked and I thought it was was kind of actually I'm sorry, I found it
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:04.920]  kind of amusing. Why? Because they can't attack you if you're walking the walk in God's
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:11.080]  right, except by lying. And so they just lie. And they portrayed poor Bob here as somebody
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:14.720]  who's some money grubbing individual out there trying to make money off poor people. It's
[2:56:14.720 --> 2:56:19.760]  all just a lie. But if you look at the facts and this is why they're trying to discourage
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:24.600]  people from doing it. See, because if you go out and you seek out those facts for yourself
[2:56:24.600 --> 2:56:29.920]  and you look at the truth for yourself, then you can make your own judgment about what
[2:56:29.920 --> 2:56:34.640]  is going on and about the people who are involved in it. And that's all that I would
[2:56:34.640 --> 2:56:39.680]  say. I recommend that you do because I think if you are looking at the facts, if you are
[2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:44.240]  thinking these things through for yourself, if you decide that you want to give it a test
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:50.360]  for yourself, then you can come to conclusions as I myself did. But I think keep in the
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:53.960]  back of your mind while you're doing it, that a lot of the things that go on these
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:59.640]  days are being manipulated by people and the one goal they do have in mind is to make
[2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:04.480]  sure that this is done or if it's presented. Why wouldn't you want to research something
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:09.400]  like this and scientifically establish beyond any reasonable doubt the truth about it so
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:12.760]  that it could then be widely available to people around the world? You know why they're
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:17.600]  not doing it? Because they figured they can't make billions upon billions of dollars from
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:21.760]  it. And if they haven't figured out a way to monetize it, as they say, they don't want
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:27.160]  to get it out there. Well, we do. So go look for yourself. If you have the time, you've
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:32.280]  got the internet, we've got the means, go look for yourself, think it through and then
[2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:36.680]  make your own judgment about what's going to be best for your health. In the environment
[2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:43.960]  we're living in right now, it's an imperative. We'll be right back after this.
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:48.880]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world. A lot of people that never deliver.
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:55.960]  Well, I'm here to tell you, Info Wars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:58:01.280]  ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists and because of the great
[2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:07.160]  team at Info Wars. And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen. So right now, humanity's
[2:58:07.160 --> 2:58:12.240]  awakening is explosive. It's powerful. It's incredible. But there's major obstacles coming
[2:58:12.240 --> 2:58:17.560]  down the road. And the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on Info
[2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:22.360]  Wars is to the spirit, is your financial support. We make it really easy at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:58:22.360 --> 2:58:28.520]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple
[2:58:28.520 --> 2:58:32.480]  the work they ever have, because they volunteered to do it. And Owen and the rest of the crew
[2:58:32.480 --> 2:58:37.520]  will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during this election year that's so critical, but
[2:58:37.520 --> 2:58:42.520]  they need the financing to put them in the field. Go to InfoWarsStore.com and fight for
[2:58:42.520 --> 2:58:44.760]  your own future.
[2:58:44.760 --> 2:58:49.840]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election. And already you've seen all
[2:58:49.840 --> 2:58:53.120]  sorts of crazy things happen. The globalists are trying to plunge the economy. They're
[2:58:53.120 --> 2:58:57.120]  trying to start wars. They're trying to overthrow the president. They're trying to silence free
[2:58:57.120 --> 2:59:01.600]  speech. They're trying to trigger riots in the streets. But everything they do is blowing
[2:59:01.600 --> 2:59:05.960]  up in their face. We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading
[2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:11.840]  the word, keep countering their lies. And we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:59.720]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening
[2:59:59.720 --> 3:00:02.120]  to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:02.120 --> 3:00:15.560]  America is awake. That's what's happening now. Get ready for it.
[3:00:15.560 --> 3:00:21.720]  I came here tonight because I wanted to meet Alex. I wanted me to number you. And the vibe
[3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:29.480]  so far has just been nothing but support. I can tell you that I kind of describe what's
[3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:35.120]  been going on with my family and everything else that's happened with all this Russiagate
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:40.480]  shit. And it's kind of like this long boxing match. We're kind of in the 15th round now.
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:49.280]  We feel like things are kind of winding down. You take so many gut punches and things happen
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:54.320]  and you just kind of become numb to everything. But we have an absolute bulldog in our corner
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:01:07.600]  right now. Her name is Sidney Powell. We wish, hindsight is what it is, but would it have
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:13.120]  been great for her to be our lawyer from the beginning? Yes, but things happen and you
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:15.480]  make certain decisions, but at the end of the day...
[3:01:15.480 --> 3:01:17.480]  Lay down what happened. Tell him.
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:18.980]  Start moving in.
[3:01:18.980 --> 3:01:25.560]  Well, kind of going off with what Ivan said. I mean, Crossfire Hurricane did not begin
[3:01:25.560 --> 3:01:34.280]  July 31st. It just didn't. We know that my father was set up from as early as 2015, maybe
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:41.280]  even before that. I mean, he was absolutely targeted because of his loud voice against
[3:01:41.280 --> 3:01:45.200]  the Obama administration. I mean, I never forget a conversation that he and I had whenever
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:50.160]  he retired from the DIA. He said, look, we talked about getting into business together,
[3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:55.440]  but then he said, look, I'm tired of listening to the Obama administration lie to the American
[3:01:55.440 --> 3:02:01.640]  public about the ISIS threat. And that's really when we got in a role in the media.
[3:02:01.640 --> 3:02:06.640]  And he went on to various talk shows and instantly became a target because he was out there basically
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:11.640]  calling out Obama and all these other deep state officials that were just out there.
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:12.640]  What's up?
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:20.160]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyways, I mean, it's been a long journey. It's so complex
[3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:25.960]  what's going on with this case right now from December 2015, and then all of a sudden we
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:33.120]  were at the RNC convention. That happened. And then August 10 was really when the three
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:40.680]  individuals were opened up in Crossfire Hurricane. August 16 was when the deep state decided
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:46.640]  to open up an investigation on General Flynn. The very next day, the August 17 date that
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:55.680]  Ivan Raiklin mentioned was when they decided to send this FBI agent in and essentially
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:02:59.640]  to spy. I mean, especially get that baseline reading on my father for whatever reason.
[3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:05.320]  I mean, the biggest reason they went after him was because that one picture of him sitting
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:12.520]  at a table with Putin when he and I traveled to Moscow in December 2015. And what's never
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:19.720]  been reported by the media, which to this day is unfathomable, was we absolutely briefed
[3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:27.000]  the DIA the day before we left for the trip and two weeks after we got back from the trip.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:31.720]  Purgatory sanction told them everything that as far as what we're going to do. I mean,
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:37.120]  everything that he talked about while we're in Russia is available to the public. So that
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:44.640]  was it. I mean, there was absolutely no reason why these guys could even open up a CIA investigation
[3:03:44.640 --> 3:03:51.360]  on other than the fact that he didn't speak and didn't live up to the status quo in terms
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:58.000]  of the establishment that is in D.C. So I mean, from August to December, there was obviously
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:04.480]  a lot of talk about him being the vice president. And then we get into the in the December going
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:08.920]  into January. And obviously, I think most people know about the January 24th interview
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:14.880]  that, you know, where the two agents were sent into the White House by, you know, the
[3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:18.800]  ass that are, you know, Comey and McCabe. I mean, I mean, I'm personally I'm personally
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:24.920]  sick and tired of reading Comey's tweets and and John and John Brenner for that matter.
[3:04:24.920 --> 3:04:29.360]  I mean, you look at what these guys say, and it's like these guys were the heads, the heads
[3:04:29.360 --> 3:04:34.200]  of some of the most powerful agencies in the world. And it's just it's just so mind boggling
[3:04:34.200 --> 3:04:41.360]  to me that that these guys were were running in our most secret organizations, if you will.
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:50.240]  And so, you know, from from really the end of January of 2017 to December 1st of 2017,
[3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:55.600]  when when he was forced to plead guilty, it's wonderful that so many people are now thinking
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:05:00.280]  about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here but across
[3:05:00.280 --> 3:05:06.160]  the world. That's good. People need to be self-sufficient. The average person is living
[3:05:06.160 --> 3:05:11.360]  hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know how to change their tire. We need
[3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:16.680]  to reverse this trend and start getting prepared. And that means even with just the basics,
[3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:22.600]  even a three week food supply that you know is always there that you only go to an emergency.
[3:05:22.600 --> 3:05:27.920]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so. And things

[3:06:20.160 --> 3:06:24.920]  of sadness center finger. It's like people asking all the time, why did you plead guilty?
[3:06:24.920 --> 3:06:31.880]  I mean, think about it. I can tell you unequivocally that I was absolutely threatened. I was absolutely
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:38.520]  threatened with being indicted. And I'm sure, you know, I'm sure everybody knows Sean Hannity
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:45.200]  is he's been, you know, loud voice for us, but he absolutely is correct that, you know,
[3:06:45.200 --> 3:06:52.000]  I had a father that absolutely fell on the sword, you know, to protect me from going
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:57.240]  through something that I would have had to put my, you know, my then four month old and
[3:06:57.240 --> 3:07:02.640]  my wife through. Okay. And look, I'm not up here. I'm not up here, you know, looking
[3:07:02.640 --> 3:07:06.360]  for sympathy. I'm just, I'm just letting you know that, I mean, this is the truth. This
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:10.840]  is what happened. My, you know, my, my, my mother's not guilty of anything. I think I
[3:07:10.840 --> 3:07:18.040]  think, I think everybody here knows that. And thank you. Thank you. So look, look, last
[3:07:18.040 --> 3:07:22.680]  thing, last thing I'll say, last thing I'll say is that the, the, the, the story general
[3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:27.320]  is so complex. I want you to keep going for another 20 minutes. We got plenty of time.
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:32.200]  We have like an hour of question and answer. Talk about your father as a patriot and what
[3:07:32.200 --> 3:07:37.880]  you guys went through and the vindication now that the whole lie is coming down and
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:42.400]  Roger Stone, everything just tell them what happened. Tell them in five minutes what happened,
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:50.880]  what you guys went through as American patriots. Yeah, um, I mean, as far as, I mean, as far
[3:07:50.880 --> 3:07:56.840]  as what, what you can picture, you know, just, just a regular, you know, a, a, American,
[3:07:56.840 --> 3:08:02.880]  you know, a military family who, who essentially wasn't, I mean, we, we weren't wealthy people
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:06.640]  to begin with. I mean, we had, you know, my father and I had, you know, had a, had a private
[3:08:06.640 --> 3:08:09.720]  business, you know, after he left the DIA, but, you know, we weren't making, we weren't
[3:08:09.720 --> 3:08:13.400]  raking in, you know, million of dollars. And then, you know, all of a sudden this stuff,
[3:08:13.400 --> 3:08:17.440]  you know, kind of came down with, with having to hire lawyers and, and, uh,
[3:08:17.440 --> 3:08:27.720]  Yeah, well, I mean, I mean, again, he went out of my father because he was outspoken
[3:08:27.720 --> 3:08:32.080]  on a number of things. The main thing was Obama's signature foreign policy, which was,
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:36.400]  which was, which was the, uh, the Iran deal. I mean, the Iran deal, and I'm not an expert
[3:08:36.400 --> 3:08:40.920]  on Iran, but, but I can tell you that the Iran deal was, was a big thing that he was,
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:45.360]  uh, you know, that he was, uh, that he was highly against. And there's a lot of people
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:50.040]  who are major, major, major critic of that. But, but the, but the other, the other part
[3:08:50.040 --> 3:08:56.840]  of it is he was, he was, was willing to call out, you know, how much the deep state and
[3:08:56.840 --> 3:09:02.000]  specifically, you know, CIA and FBI had become very, very political organizations. And that's,
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:05.560]  and that's still, I mean, you see what happens, what's going on in the news and you see what's
[3:09:05.560 --> 3:09:09.920]  happening with, you know, with, with, with all these partisans that we just saw in that,
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:14.240]  with this impeachment process, with, uh, you know, with Adam Schiff, all these just political
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:19.080]  bureaucrats that, that got up in front of national television. And it's, it's as clear
[3:09:19.080 --> 3:09:23.680]  as day, just listening to these people, you know, I mean, like how in the tank they are
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:30.680]  for, you know, for the left. And, um, I mean, as far as, I mean, I can tell you that my
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:35.760]  father has wanted to speak out about this stuff, like ever since day one, but, you know,
[3:09:35.760 --> 3:09:41.040]  for obvious reasons, um, you know, he's, he hasn't been able to, but again, I mentioned
[3:09:41.040 --> 3:09:45.320]  Sidney Powell and how she's been, uh, you know, a big advocate and, and obviously very,
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:51.520]  very, uh, very, very outspoken for us. And, you know, that's, yeah,
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:56.400]  after all the persecution you've gone through to come here and speak on these live feeds
[3:09:56.400 --> 3:10:00.600]  out here, what, what, but let's get back to the beginning of the few minutes we have left.
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:03.480]  I appreciate you coming here today and your courage to do it. I know you've been, you're
[3:10:03.480 --> 3:10:06.800]  your family persecuted. I've been persecuted. We know what it's like. We get persecuted
[3:10:06.800 --> 3:10:11.000]  because we support America. We realize that persecution is actually a blessing and we
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:13.760]  don't see ourselves as victims. Some people listen to what this guy is saying because
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:18.960]  his dad, just like Roger Stone and just like some other people, they tried to put his father
[3:10:18.960 --> 3:10:25.840]  in prison. They tried to hold years in prison and bankrupting them to lie about President
[3:10:25.840 --> 3:10:31.080]  Trump and lie about the populist election we had. So I hear a lot of talking. I love
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:35.960]  you guys. Just for respect. Everybody just stop talking for one second. Just just one
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:44.240]  second. One second. Just one second in your lives. His father wanted to serve America
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:54.440]  and try to defend our republic. And because, and because he did that, they targeted him
[3:10:54.440 --> 3:11:00.160]  because he wanted to put in the Trump administration patriots that would promote freedom worldwide.
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:07.480]  They were scared of the army that George Washington founded 245 years ago, finally getting control
[3:11:07.480 --> 3:11:13.240]  of the government again from these communists and these globalists. And then they launched
[3:11:13.240 --> 3:11:19.840]  every attack they had. And now, four years later, all their designs have failed. But
[3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:25.240]  the people like General Flynn are such humble men who just defend their country. They're
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:31.520]  not like me, a wicked devil. They don't see all the angles. And now that they've been
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:39.280]  victorious, they are silent in the face of their victory. We have discredited Obama.
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:46.960]  We have discredited Hillary. We have restored the republic. We have defeated the chai comms.
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:53.120]  America has had a great victory. But America doesn't have a media to tell you the victory
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:12:00.520]  you've had. So General Flynn faces fake sentencing. And I say, like I've told Roger Stone, call
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:06.160]  their bluff because we've done nothing wrong. We're good people. So, General Flynn, son
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:15.480]  of God bless you. You sit up here. You try to explain how you're this good person. We
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:26.320]  know you're good. We know your father's good. You don't get attacked by CNN and MSNBC and
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:35.920]  ABC if you're evil. You get attacked when you're good. We know that. And America is
[3:12:35.920 --> 3:12:45.840]  rising now. And the enemy knows it. So, hey, talk about you. I'm stronger than ever. Go
[3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:48.800]  be strong. Tell them the truth. Close it.
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:53.360]  All right. I mean, the last thing I'll say is, you know, we still have a fight in front
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:59.200]  of us. We have a couple of motions out there right now that we're still waiting on this
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:06.200]  Judge Emmett Sullivan to either grant or deny. There's kind of a battle of...
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:11.280]  There's no question about that. I mean, I think, again, I mentioned the whole boxing
[3:13:11.280 --> 3:13:16.200]  round analogy. I mean, to me, it feels like we're at the end of this. I can just tell
[3:13:16.200 --> 3:13:21.880]  you right now that something has got to happen before this election in November. I mean,
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:26.240]  something has to happen. I'm sick and tired of reading about, oh, the potential fixes
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:30.960]  and what we're going to do here and there. I want to see people held accountable. I'm
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:35.240]  tired, again, I'm tired of these guys running their mouths on Twitter, running their mouths
[3:13:35.240 --> 3:13:42.240]  on social media. I want to see... Let's just see one big name arrested. Just one. I don't
[3:13:42.240 --> 3:13:50.120]  care. I don't care if it's Brennan or Cohn, but just one of them. Just one of them, okay?
[3:13:50.120 --> 3:13:55.280]  Because look, no behavior is not going to change if something... You know, we throw
[3:13:55.280 --> 3:14:00.720]  around that word accountability and it just doesn't feel like accountability is happening
[3:14:00.720 --> 3:14:08.080]  right now. Trust me, I'm just as frustrated if not more than the next person. All we can
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:13.960]  do is continue to do things like this, speak out and let it be known that you're just as
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:27.080]  pissed off as I am that, hey, Bill Barr, John Durham, I know you're out there, but let us
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:33.280]  know what the hell you're doing. I'd love to be able to answer that, but again, I'm going
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:36.240]  to defer all questions like that to Sidney Powell. Sidney Powell, if you ever want to
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:40.880]  contact her, you can always reach their website, but she's probably one of the most open, transparent
[3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:46.360]  people that she'd ever meet. And she's family to us now, and I'm telling you, I mean, just
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:51.400]  kind of stay tuned because there's certain things that can't be made public that will
[3:14:51.400 --> 3:14:55.280]  be made public. And, you know, it's just, you know, I hate to even say stuff like that,
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:14:58.880]  but at the end of the day, at the end of the day, we're going to win.
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:06.280]  Let me say this. By the way, Michael Flynn Jr. tamed here humbly today to expose the persecution
[3:15:06.280 --> 3:15:12.280]  his father, a noble army officer, has gone through defending this republic and trying
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:17.600]  to secure our future. And so come back over here. You're a very humble person. It's like
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:25.920]  your father. You don't have my shortcomings. And I'm here to tell you, we need to stop
[3:15:25.920 --> 3:15:30.000]  being humble about what's happened. Your dad's been a patriot his whole life. He stood up
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.840]  to the globalists. He tried to give Trump good advice. He was persecuted. He's a hero.
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:38.520]  Now we need to celebrate our heroes. People that got congressional medal of honors, they're
[3:15:38.520 --> 3:15:42.200]  wonderful. People got silver stars, bronze stars. They're amazing. We love them. But
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:46.280]  this is the real fight for America right now. And you're, you're, you know, you're humble
[3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:51.720]  about this, but you came up here tonight. I know under major pressure and persecution.
[3:15:51.720 --> 3:15:55.880]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector

[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:19.200]  is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security

[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:29.640]  to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:33.600]  beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands
[3:17:33.600 --> 3:17:37.800]  of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:41.920]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless
[3:17:41.920 --> 3:17:52.920]  tax case. Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:58.240]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars, it's because
[3:17:58.240 --> 3:18:05.080]  we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up. That's why it's
[3:18:05.080 --> 3:18:10.280]  critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down
[3:18:10.280 --> 3:18:14.960]  when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:20.640]  expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their soul
[3:18:20.640 --> 3:18:25.880]  to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:31.680]  driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are
[3:18:31.680 --> 3:18:38.800]  awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these
[3:18:38.800 --> 3:18:44.360]  wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are
[3:18:44.360 --> 3:18:50.840]  alive. They fear the fact that we love God, and that's all we ever have to know is that
[3:18:50.840 --> 3:18:52.840]  God is in charge.
[3:18:52.840 --> 3:18:57.240]  Don't be a victim. If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard
[3:18:57.240 --> 3:19:00.840]  because that can lower your immune system. Drink extra purified clean water so that no
[3:19:00.840 --> 3:19:04.560]  toxins weigh you down. Get plenty of hydration, prayer, and meditation has been proven to
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:08.400]  make you healthier. Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:13.120]  oil. Take your colloidal silver, all of it. That's what allows you to be healthier and
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:17.960]  get plenty of sleep. We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:21.680]  that's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown that go after this
[3:19:21.680 --> 3:19:26.560]  whole Corona SARS family. A virus we're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles. That
[3:19:26.560 --> 3:19:29.880]  will be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:33.640]  three ounce bottles. Great to have period, really good for your gums, really great for
[3:19:33.640 --> 3:19:37.320]  your teeth. We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste. Again, we're the
[3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:40.680]  only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:43.800]  based here in the U.S. that's in all these homeless security documents and everything
[3:19:43.800 --> 3:19:47.680]  because we get the best stuff. There's a lot of patriots. There's not just bad guys coming
[3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:55.480]  after us with the flip side of all the good guys and good gals. It's very exciting. You're
[3:19:55.480 --> 3:20:04.720]  listening to the Alex Jones show. The people watching out there on the internet and everybody
[3:20:04.720 --> 3:20:09.840]  here in person, why you decided to come out and speak up for your father tonight. I think
[3:20:09.840 --> 3:20:16.600]  it's because you know, the tide has turned, the hoax is broken. We're Americans. We're
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:23.960]  not Russian agents. We love our country. We believe in America. Why did you come out
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:30.240]  tonight? I came up here with Ivan Regland. I don't know where he's at. He's around here
[3:20:30.240 --> 3:20:38.840]  somewhere. Ivan's always dragging, pulling me in five different directions. We're at
[3:20:38.840 --> 3:20:43.600]  CPAC before and I'm going to be there in the next couple of days. I came here because I
[3:20:43.600 --> 3:20:48.680]  knew some of the infowar guys were going to be here, especially Alex Jones. We've actually
[3:20:48.680 --> 3:20:54.760]  never met in person. It's certainly a great honor to meet Alex Jones. I know and obviously
[3:20:54.760 --> 3:21:01.600]  followed your story and I certainly appreciate everything that you've been through. I can't
[3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:08.280]  imagine what the deep platforming has done with some of these ridiculous tech companies.
[3:21:08.280 --> 3:21:12.720]  At the end of the day, you're still here. You're still standing. You're still doing
[3:21:12.720 --> 3:21:18.200]  your thing and that's important. Trust me, what I will say, because I had this conversation
[3:21:18.200 --> 3:21:22.120]  and this is the last thing I'll say, I had this conversation with my father all the time.
[3:21:22.120 --> 3:21:29.200]  I said, look, your time is not done with America. You know that once this is all said and done,
[3:21:29.200 --> 3:21:34.320]  you're going to be pulled back into the scene in one way, shape or form. I don't know what
[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:40.320]  that is. I'm not going to speak for my father in that regard, but I can tell you that his
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:47.800]  time is not done. He will get his ass back out there and speak out about the things that
[3:21:47.800 --> 3:21:52.800]  need to be spoken out about, i.e., these deeps say that.
[3:21:52.800 --> 3:21:59.200]  That's right. General Flynn bet on America three plus years ago and tried to put the
[3:21:59.200 --> 3:22:05.960]  White House stock with patriots. He was attacked as enemy number one. And now, four years later,
[3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:09.400]  we are turning the tide. His son is here with us tonight. This is a beautiful time.
[3:22:09.400 --> 3:22:15.400]  God bless you. Tell your father we're indebted to him. We appreciate him. It's powerful.
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:32.720]  Amazing. That's why we came to D.C. to confront the tyrants.
[3:22:32.720 --> 3:22:37.760]  All right, Matt Bracken here, and you've got me for the rest of the hour. Very powerful
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:45.720]  watching Michael Flynn Jr. Can you imagine his father? How hard it must be for a warrior
[3:22:45.720 --> 3:22:53.440]  to be gagged like Roger Stone to be forced by the deep state into the position he's in
[3:22:53.440 --> 3:22:58.280]  where he can't even defend himself. But the day will come. All the heroes are going to
[3:22:58.280 --> 3:23:07.200]  rise again. And this tyranny that we're seeing in America with heroes like Roger Stone and
[3:23:07.200 --> 3:23:13.280]  General Flynn being oppressed by these deep state tyrants, even though theoretically we
[3:23:13.280 --> 3:23:18.960]  have the White House, the deep state is so powerful, it just doesn't let go. But imagine
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:25.000]  if you lived in Canada and you had a lunatic like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:32.440]  your president. That's what they've got in Canada right now. Canada is becoming a tyranny.
[3:23:32.440 --> 3:23:36.760]  And this segment and the next segment, I'd like to introduce somebody to you and then
[3:23:36.760 --> 3:23:44.400]  also introduce a case to you, which sounds unbelievably Orwellian, because like Roger
[3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:51.280]  Stone, the principles involved are gagged by the court. They can be sent to jail for
[3:23:51.280 --> 3:23:59.560]  discussing this story. It's about a father whose young daughter was brainwashed by these
[3:23:59.560 --> 3:24:09.080]  crazy LGBTQ radicals into thinking momentarily she's a boy and then immediately injected
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:15.040]  with massive doses of testosterone to the point where this child grew a beard and has
[3:24:15.040 --> 3:24:22.440]  a permanently deepened voice and has been sterilized. So there's the journalist that's
[3:24:22.440 --> 3:24:27.680]  covering this story who can't even talk about it in Canada, can't write about it in Canada,
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:33.240]  can't link videos that we can see on YouTube, can't be seen in Canada. Her name is Laura
[3:24:33.240 --> 3:24:38.640]  Lynn Thompson, and I'd like to bring her on and she can actually describe what's going
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:42.960]  on with this case. If Laura is there, come on, Laura, come on in.
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:46.120]  You bet. You bet. Can you hear me, Matt? Yes.
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:50.720]  You hear me? Okay, great. Thank you so much for covering this because we can't cover it
[3:24:50.720 --> 3:24:55.720]  in Canada. What they've done is they had a young girl totally brainwashed in school that
[3:24:55.720 --> 3:25:05.280]  she can be gender fluid. Then we had teachers who changed her name without informing the
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:10.240]  teachers, so without informing the parents. So the parents didn't know until the yearbook
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:15.840]  came out that their daughter had changed her name. And then they found out, okay, she's
[3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:21.720]  having all of these problems. There had been some other concerns for her growing up being
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:26.480]  a teenager, the parents going through a divorce, things like that. So all of a sudden they
[3:25:26.480 --> 3:25:32.960]  say we got to take her to a doctor. This doctor says, oh, yeah, you are definitely transgender.
[3:25:32.960 --> 3:25:37.080]  Now this young lady had already had a crush on two male teachers. You know, she kind of
[3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:43.640]  had a like a thing. So she had the heterosexual tendencies. So this Dr. Frankenstein tells
[3:25:43.640 --> 3:25:50.240]  this young girl that you are transgender and sends her off to our British Columbia Children's
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:54.640]  Hospital. At British Columbia Children's Hospital, she gets a two hour visit. At the
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:26:00.360]  end of the two hour visit, this doctor decides, oh, we're just going to offer her testosterone
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:06.840]  on the very first visit. How much do you know about a child on the very first visit? And
[3:26:06.840 --> 3:26:12.240]  by the way, the previous doctor who sent her there said, you know what, she had heterosexual
[3:26:12.240 --> 3:26:17.600]  tendencies, but the thing is she's gay. So we're going to turn her into a boy and then
[3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:23.800]  we're going to, you know, send her off as as a male in into her, you know, into her
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:29.440]  future life. So this is what happened. Then the father, his heart was broken. You know,
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:34.640]  when you have a child, you agree to something, you agree to protect that child till till
[3:26:34.640 --> 3:26:40.040]  the end of days. And this father's heart was broken. He started fighting it in the courts.
[3:26:40.040 --> 3:26:46.200]  Do you know what the courts did? First of all, they assigned a lesbian lawyer named
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:51.320]  Barbara Finley. She calls herself this. She calls herself a fat, ugly lesbian lawyer.
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:57.120]  That's her words for herself. And this lesbian lawyer assumes the case for this, this young
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:04.680]  girl. And she basically has had taken mind control, I would say, and has propelled this
[3:27:04.680 --> 3:27:11.920]  case and has acted on her behalf. They then got a activist judge who is an LGBTQ activist
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:20.200]  judge, Justice Mazari and Justice Bowden. Both of them put orders in place that this
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:28.800]  father could not speak publicly or get this mat, not even privately, without threat of
[3:27:28.800 --> 3:27:33.880]  being arrested without warrant. There would be an arrest without warrant if he spoke even
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:40.120]  privately about this situation. Not only that, he was ordered that if he ever refers to his
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:47.400]  daughter as a daughter and not a son and not by male pronouns, he is guilty of family
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:55.960]  violence. This is a unbelievable situation where the state has drugged and heading towards
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:28:01.280]  mutilation of this young girl. Her voice is changing. She's growing a beard. She's
[3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:13.960]  sterile. She's 15 now, 15. We don't know anything at 15. 15 is sterilized by the state. And
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:20.920]  our Canadian justice system, our medical professions have committed malpractice, in my opinion.
[3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:28.120]  Our educational systems have conspired for parental alienation, all of it. So the father
[3:28:28.120 --> 3:28:32.480]  had to go very silent. I'm not even allowed to say his name. I'm not allowed to say a
[3:28:32.480 --> 3:28:39.160]  father's name. Laura, we're going to be going to a break and we'll come back in a few minutes
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:45.240]  and pick the story back up. But this is beyond belief. Do people remember when healthy people
[3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:52.120]  were lobotomized? It's the same thing. We'll be back in a minute.

[3:29:57.140 --> 3:30:03.780]  is serious on multiple levels. It's very communicable. It spreads very, very fast. It is killing
[3:30:03.780 --> 3:30:08.440]  a lot of people. And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:13.640]  is. And the Lighthouse is now openly challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist, and

[3:31:22.520 --> 3:31:27.480]  it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years
[3:31:27.480 --> 3:31:32.920]  and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years
[3:31:32.920 --> 3:31:40.440]  ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in stock X2, 40%

[3:32:56.440 --> 3:33:14.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:26.280]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:26.280 --> 3:33:37.720]  All right, we're back with Laura Lynn Thompson. She actually worked for the 700 Club of Canada
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:45.600]  until she was hounded off of the air as an Islamophob. No, excuse me, another phob. I
[3:33:45.600 --> 3:33:52.000]  guess a trans-LGBTQ phob. A traditional woman.
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:57.440]  Yeah, I stood against, you know, here in British Columbia, we have dozens and dozens and dozens
[3:33:57.440 --> 3:34:03.000]  of transgender indoctrination books from kindergarten to grade five. Okay, then it gets worse from
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:07.560]  grade five on. And so I started saying, listen, do anything you want when you're an adult.
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:11.680]  You want to cut your shlong off and you know, you want to have mutilating surgery, remove
[3:34:11.680 --> 3:34:15.920]  healthy breasts. That's your business when you're an adult. It's Canada, you know, fly
[3:34:15.920 --> 3:34:22.000]  your flag. But but children, children are sacred. Children are precious. And so I began
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:28.520]  to fight against the indoctrination of children. And so I was targeted heavily to contacting
[3:34:28.520 --> 3:34:32.800]  the CRTC in Canada, the governing body of media and asking that I would be removed and
[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:37.000]  never be allowed to speak. I've been called every name in the book. And you know what?
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:42.400]  It really doesn't matter. So now I'm standing for the kids and I'm standing against the
[3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:47.000]  establishment and these doctors that are are transitioning kids without even a thought
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:54.560]  of it. We have a doctor in this case that is transitioning 500 ministry. These are foster
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:35:00.840]  kids, ministry of children and family kids, 500 of them. This is a 7. Something percent
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:08.680]  of all ministry of children and family kids. This is huge. This is sinister. It's evil.
[3:35:08.680 --> 3:35:13.920]  And we've really had enough. And so in Canada, we are declaring war on this. And in this
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:22.040]  one situation, we stand with this father, we stand with a father who says, how can you
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:26.520]  transition my daughter? She can't get a tattoo without my permission. She can't drink a glass
[3:35:26.520 --> 3:35:32.200]  of wine. She can't get married. She can't drive. How is she making the decision to change
[3:35:32.200 --> 3:35:37.400]  to a completely different sex? And how is that OK? And so we stand with him. So when
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:42.880]  he began speaking, he he had a publication ban and he broke his silence. We have decided
[3:35:42.880 --> 3:35:48.120]  to stand with him. And so I did an I did an interview with him and so did a fellow named
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:54.040]  Frank Vaughn. And they told me to take my video down. And I did not comply. I was hauled
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:59.080]  into court. Short note, short notice leave. I was sent one email, you know, be a court.
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:02.920]  So I did do that. And the judge said that you have to take it down. By this time, we
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:09.360]  found out that, you know, the federalist and mass resistance in places like this rare
[3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:14.800]  sites from the U.S. and from Australia and Germany are getting this video. The story
[3:36:14.800 --> 3:36:19.520]  is going wild. And so I didn't need to keep my videos up. So I said, I'll take them down.
[3:36:19.520 --> 3:36:24.240]  So but when I didn't take them down fast enough after I left court, it took me a few days
[3:36:24.240 --> 3:36:27.720]  because, you know, you're busy and you've got a lot of things to do. When I didn't take
[3:36:27.720 --> 3:36:32.520]  it down fast enough, they sent police to my home. So I wasn't home. Then the police
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:37.440]  call me. Can you meet us at the police station? So I had to go and meet at the police station.
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:43.040]  Upon which the police actually told me the names, the two names that the this daughter
[3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:47.200]  has gone by, which I did not previously know the names because the father was very protective
[3:36:47.200 --> 3:36:52.480]  of his daughter. And so I didn't know the names. And so who told them the names? This
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:59.960]  lesbian lawyer, Barbara Finley, who has been, you know, defending this young lady and indoctrinating
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:08.640]  her further and activating this girl has become the activist pawn. And we're sick of it. If
[3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:13.160]  that had happened to any one of us, we would stand. And so I have to go back to court on
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:19.200]  March 9 to defend whether I'm in noncompliance. Perhaps I'm in noncompliance today. But here's
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:22.960]  the thing. Once in a while, you get to a place in life where you must speak. If you
[3:37:22.960 --> 3:37:27.880]  do not speak, then you are complicit to the evil going on in the land. Violence is
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:35.320]  that's where I'm at. You know, that's right. This this I had I had made a comparison already
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:41.120]  in my mind of this evil to something that had happened, you know, a century ago up and
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:46.680]  up through World War Two into the 50s, where there was a, you know, younger people may
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:51.920]  not be familiar with this, a quote unquote surgical procedure called lobotomy, where
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:58.840]  difficult or met quote unquote mentally deficient people, schizophrenic people, they put a wire
[3:37:58.840 --> 3:38:04.160]  in through the corner of the eye and drug it around your frontal, your frontal cortex
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:10.800]  until you became a vegetable. This actually happened to one of the Kennedys. Rosemary
[3:38:10.800 --> 3:38:16.160]  Kennedy, beautiful young girl. She had had a difficult birth and she said she wasn't
[3:38:16.160 --> 3:38:21.240]  going to go to college, you could say. And she was sort of embarrassed into her family.
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:27.960]  So the Kennedy patriarchs, Joe Kennedy had her lobotomized turned us into somebody who
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:34.760]  didn't know what day it was, barely knew her name. And this was at the time considered
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:41.480]  science. And it was done to thousands of people. Other people were forcibly sterilized. There
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:47.840]  were judges that said, you know, 100 years of idiots is enough, you know, four generations
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:54.720]  of idiots is enough and just sterilized people deemed mentally deficient and up in Canada
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:59.760]  and in Australia, there were still, I mean, you're still working through this whole process
[3:38:59.760 --> 3:39:05.400]  of what was done to the Aboriginal kids who were drug away from their families and put
[3:39:05.400 --> 3:39:11.640]  into, you know, basically Westernizing state, you know, brainwashing centers, you could
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:17.720]  call it for their own good. At the time that was considered a great idea to Westernizing
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:23.240]  you know, the Canadian Aboriginal kids, the first Canadians, that's now considered a crisis,
[3:39:23.240 --> 3:39:28.880]  a disaster or a horrible stain on Canadian history. And we need to do that with this
[3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:36.240]  trans movement, these, these LGBTQ radical ghouls, they can brainwash a child to the
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:42.160]  point where they can just momentarily make a decision to step through a trap door and
[3:39:42.160 --> 3:39:50.080]  start taking testosterone. This is not changing a girl into a boy. It's mutilating and sterilizing
[3:39:50.080 --> 3:39:58.400]  a girl. She'll always be a girl and she's now going to be mutilated, sterilized. Yes.
[3:39:58.400 --> 3:40:02.360]  And it's affecting, you know, sexual activity for the rest of their lives. It's affecting
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:06.360]  their identity for the rest of their lives. And this is all being done without parental
[3:40:06.360 --> 3:40:14.520]  consent. We have a 4,500 percent global increase in referrals to gender clinics. Hello, something
[3:40:14.520 --> 3:40:19.560]  is wrong. And it used to be, you know, when, when you and I were young, that there was
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:23.480]  both kids and, and there was punk rockers, you know, and you could kind of get over that
[3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:26.560]  phase and take the earrings out of your nose and all that. And, you know, you get back
[3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:32.840]  to being an adult in this phase, in this social contagion, a child is forever devastated.
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:37.960]  And so while they're this, this, this ghoulish doctor is telling parents, hey, if you're
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:42.560]  not getting your drugs fast enough, just, you know, say the suicide word. If you say
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:47.760]  suicide, oh, everyone's going to move for you. But here they are moving a young girl
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:52.200]  into a position where in just a couple years, she might go, you know what, that was a really
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:56.920]  dumb phase. I don't know what I was thinking. Now my voice is deep. I still got a partial
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:41:04.000]  girl's body, but I have a beard. Oh my gosh. That's where we face suicide.
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:07.720]  I hope that they turn around. I hope that these victims, because that's what they are,
[3:41:07.720 --> 3:41:12.840]  their child victims. I hope they turn around and sue them and also sue the state for putting,
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:19.240]  for actually fronting for this. We're going to, we're going to, we've only got about a
[3:41:19.240 --> 3:41:24.800]  minute left, but we're going to follow this up and because you have a court date and just
[3:41:24.800 --> 3:41:29.760]  the fact that this video is being made at March 9th, what just the fact that this video
[3:41:29.760 --> 3:41:35.040]  is being made and shared and will be spread around in Canada are different in Ottawa and
[3:41:35.040 --> 3:41:41.000]  others, you could be in trouble for that. Yeah. This is purely or rolling. It has to
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:45.320]  be told, Matt. And I thank you for telling it. We have got to get the word out. Stop
[3:41:45.320 --> 3:41:50.440]  mutilating our kids. We are not going to be silent any longer. And your link to the residential
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:55.320]  schools was a good link. And now the residential schools are taking millions of dollars from
[3:41:55.320 --> 3:42:00.000]  the government. And this is going to happen in this case as well. And it's, and I think
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:04.280]  that it's almost more evil. How can you, you know, you could say teaching kids English
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:10.240]  and taking them out of these fairly hopeless, um, uh, Inuit villages where there was nothing
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:14.760]  to do and at least giving them an education. There was some benefit. And as adults, if
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:19.640]  they wanted to go back to the, to the Aboriginal ways, fine. But in this case, the children
[3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:25.960]  are permanently mutilated and sterilized. Absolutely. Thank you for pointing it out.
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:30.040]  Yes, we have to get the word out. Thank you. We're going to have you. We're going to have
[3:42:30.040 --> 3:42:36.680]  you back on again until this entire case is resolved. So we're going to a break now.
[3:42:36.680 --> 3:42:42.640]  And when, thank you, Laura, and we'll see you again as the case follows out. And when
[3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:49.640]  we come back, I'm going to, uh, talk about the COVID-19 outbreak. What else? And, uh,
[3:42:49.640 --> 3:42:51.840]  that'll take us through the hour.
[3:42:51.840 --> 3:42:58.480]  At the end of World War Two, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:04.640]  control organizations. They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:11.520]  brother, decided to repackage themselves as transhumanist. Now in the year 2020 to set
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:18.080]  the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs, uh, that robots can be given rights,
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:24.320]  you name it. They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:32.280]  someone. So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell
[3:43:32.280 --> 3:43:37.840]  what they are. This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control. And there's several big articles
[3:43:37.840 --> 3:43:43.280]  up on infowars.com that break this down. UK teen find at her house arrest for asking
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:49.000]  trans police officers, gender UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman, order to
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:56.040]  pay 1000 pound fine, Alex Jones here with two big announcements. Ultra 12 and vitamin

[3:44:53.760 --> 3:44:56.960]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here. And I love Trump all day long,
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:45:00.680]  but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot
[3:45:00.680 --> 3:45:05.760]  over and everybody, I mean, I've got a problem. And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:09.520]  That said, about two months ago, I came with a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:14.760]  a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach
[3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:19.640]  the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, infowarstore.com.
[3:45:19.640 --> 3:45:22.840]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth,
[3:45:22.840 --> 3:45:26.400]  you go to a Trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:29.600]  People say, why are you doing this? What's happening when you go? Well, we're being
[3:45:29.600 --> 3:45:33.480]  censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it. And Dr. Pachennick, let me just
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:36.800]  ask you what you think, because I've not launched this shed. It's brilliant. You've
[3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:43.720]  taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon.
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:49.440]  You have the loudest sound of all silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:57.680]  Silence. A lot of people ask me the info war secret. And I'll just tell you, I'm just
[3:45:57.680 --> 3:46:03.880]  real. Now, the problem is, I go back and forth, though, in my mind about where I stand. I
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:08.800]  mean, on basic stuff, like the Second Amendment and family and God, I'm 100%. But you get
[3:46:08.800 --> 3:46:13.640]  to other issues, I start asking myself questions. So I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:17.560]  during the middle of this crisis, selling high-quality, swareable food. Even though
[3:46:17.560 --> 3:46:21.440]  it's prepositioned, I'm right. We're right about being man-made. We're right about it
[3:46:21.440 --> 3:46:26.240]  being super deadly. We're right about being prepared. It still feels weird to be right.
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:31.840]  Isn't that crazy? But you know what? I'm getting past that. We still have swareable food. We
[3:46:31.840 --> 3:46:35.840]  have plenty of it. The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out. Other competitors
[3:46:35.840 --> 3:46:40.800]  don't have it. They're lying to you. Get your orders at an infowarstore.com. And you know
[3:46:40.800 --> 3:46:44.600]  you're going to get high-quality swareable food. But now it's not two weeks. It's four
[3:46:44.600 --> 3:46:48.720]  weeks, folks. We got the food. We got a package hit. Get your food today, high-quality, and
[3:46:48.720 --> 3:46:55.720]  get your stuff on the infowar.infowarstore.com.
[3:47:18.720 --> 3:47:35.840]  All right. Well, I think that we can mark yesterday, February 26th, as day one of a new era in
[3:47:35.840 --> 3:47:42.000]  the United States, because that's the beginning of community, the community spread, the community
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:49.920]  transfer of COVID-19, the coronavirus. And that means we're not talking about people that flew
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:56.320]  in from China or brought back from a cruise ship. These are just ordinary Americans that thought
[3:47:56.320 --> 3:48:00.720]  something was wrong. And when they finally got tested, because we've only tested like
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:07.200]  under 500 Americans, which is ridiculous. They test that many, you know, in Korea every hour.
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:15.200]  But for some reason, we're not getting the test kits out and not testing widely. So we've now got
[3:48:15.200 --> 3:48:23.040]  community spread. And we're just a week or so behind Italy. Maybe we're two weeks behind Iran
[3:48:23.040 --> 3:48:30.880]  and two months behind China. But what we've learned about this COVID-19 is it's not stoppable at this
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:39.040]  point. You know, the horse is out of the barn and it's racing. Now, I had an insight. Maybe it's
[3:48:39.040 --> 3:48:47.200]  just me. It's my peculiar mind the way that I think. I started looking at COVID-19 as an accidental
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:55.040]  weapon of mass destruction release. You know, maybe it originated in the bat cuisine market.
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:49:03.520]  And maybe it was released from a Wuhan biohazard facility, an accidental experiment that got
[3:49:03.520 --> 3:49:10.640]  loose. Infected a scientist who then started spreading it. Doesn't really matter. But it's
[3:49:10.640 --> 3:49:19.360]  out. And it occurred to me, in my mind, I made a comparison to the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:28.400]  Dr. Strangelove. In that film, one United States Air Force General, Jack D. Ripper goes crazy
[3:49:29.040 --> 3:49:36.640]  and sends his B-52 bomber wing off on a nuclear mission to Russia in a way that they could not
[3:49:36.640 --> 3:49:43.360]  be recalled. That it would be impossible to bring them back. And there's a scene in the war room
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:51.360]  with George C. Scott playing General Buck Perkinson who says, look, what's done is done. We can't
[3:49:51.360 --> 3:49:57.760]  bring it back. But if we're going to have this nuclear war, which to shame it started, you know,
[3:49:57.760 --> 3:50:04.960]  but we might as well win it. You know, it's happened. It's out there. So let's win it. And the
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:11.040]  president, played by Peter Sellers, Bald Peter Sellers says, we don't do that. America doesn't
[3:50:11.040 --> 3:50:18.640]  do that. We'll never start a war. But the general says, look, it started. You know, the crazy
[3:50:18.640 --> 3:50:26.240]  general, Jack Ripper, he's started it. So now we have to choose between a future where we lose 20
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:34.080]  million or where we lose 150 million. And it started making me wonder, are the Chinese and
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:39.520]  not only the Chinese, but the Russian and the American generals, are they now looking at this
[3:50:39.520 --> 3:50:45.280]  kind of like that big board in the war room with the bombers heading for Russia? This
[3:50:45.280 --> 3:50:52.880]  weapon of mass destruction is out. It's a fact. And one advantage when in the middle of this,
[3:50:53.440 --> 3:50:59.840]  I call it a pandemic war now, in the middle of this pandemic war against the COVID-19,
[3:51:00.720 --> 3:51:08.640]  every country has advantages and disadvantages. And a big advantage that China has is number one,
[3:51:08.640 --> 3:51:14.320]  they caught it first. They released it. They caught it first. They've had more time to study it.
[3:51:14.320 --> 3:51:21.680]  They've actually come up with some medicines that seem to be somewhat effective. But they've also
[3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:29.600]  got this extremely rigidly tightly controlled society where they can order people into their
[3:51:29.600 --> 3:51:36.160]  apartments. They can even lock their doors with, weld them shut. And then the next week, they can
[3:51:36.160 --> 3:51:41.840]  go to that apartment and say, you have to go back to your factory because of the critical
[3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:47.520]  need for the products from that factory. That gives them a level of regimentation that America
[3:51:47.520 --> 3:51:54.400]  can never accomplish. So one of the people I watch on YouTube every day is a British doctor
[3:51:54.400 --> 3:52:00.320]  named John Campbell. And this morning he had a video where somebody had sent him an email from
[3:52:00.320 --> 3:52:10.800]  a city in China. And I wrote about this on American Partisan, Chinese COVID-19 quarantine rules.
[3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:17.840]  I also wrote a piece yesterday called, Will China Win the COVID-19 Pandemic War?
[3:52:18.400 --> 3:52:26.000]  So look at the strength that China has compared to an American city. Imagine a city like Wuhan
[3:52:26.000 --> 3:52:30.480]  where it's spread out of control. They just quarantined it. They'll shoot you if you're trying
[3:52:30.480 --> 3:52:37.600]  to leave Wuhan or Hunan Province. They'll shoot you. They bulldoze the roads. What's
[3:52:37.600 --> 3:52:44.400]  happening in there is probably a death rate, 15 or 20%. That's the uncontrolled death rate.
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:50.560]  When people say, oh, don't worry, this COVID only has a 2% death rate, that's if they can take you
[3:52:50.560 --> 3:52:59.040]  into an isolation ICU with a team of surgeons and hazmat. But once a hospital is overrun,
[3:52:59.040 --> 3:53:04.640]  once the bodies are stacked in the halls and that hospital becomes a non-factor,
[3:53:05.200 --> 3:53:12.880]  then the death rate goes up to 10% or 15%. Can you imagine an American city once its hospitals are
[3:53:12.880 --> 3:53:19.680]  overrun? Immediately, I think there'll be looting of supermarkets. The pharmacies will be looted.
[3:53:19.680 --> 3:53:24.880]  The gun stores and liquor stores will be looted. There will be no way to enforce these kind of
[3:53:24.880 --> 3:53:29.920]  quarantine rules that they are doing in China. Let me read you some of these rules.
[3:53:29.920 --> 3:53:37.840]  This was sent to Dr. John Campbell. His apartment complex was issued small cards
[3:53:37.840 --> 3:53:43.520]  with a code that is scanned every time we leave and enter. No one without this card has permitted
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:49.760]  entrance into the apartment complex. Masks are absolutely required at all times and goggles
[3:53:49.760 --> 3:53:55.680]  and gloves are strongly encouraged. You are restricted to leaving the complex to three
[3:53:55.680 --> 3:54:01.280]  times a week and then only to buy groceries at one or two designated local stores.
[3:54:02.080 --> 3:54:07.200]  Travel beyond those two supermarkets is discouraged and most other items have to be
[3:54:07.200 --> 3:54:14.160]  delivered to the front gate of your complex. The only delivery drivers on motorbikes are allowed out
[3:54:14.160 --> 3:54:18.880]  and they're given a special pass. They have to wear gloves, masks, and a helmet with a visor.
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:27.680]  All at present, the only stores open are grocery and convenience stores with reduced staff and
[3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:34.160]  restricted hours and all other shops are closed. Imagine your business is just closed.
[3:54:34.160 --> 3:54:42.080]  Closed, movie theaters, coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, etc.
[3:54:42.080 --> 3:54:48.080]  Closed. All weddings and other ceremonies associated with large groups cancelled.
[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:54.880]  The economic effects are crippling. It says, people in my complex have been confirmed to
[3:54:54.880 --> 3:55:00.400]  have the virus. When this happens, you're given the option to go to a quarantine center or
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:07.200]  they will put a paper tape over your door and you can stay in your apartment. The tape is checked
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:12.800]  daily and if it is torn, you'll be taken to a quarantine center for violating your agreement.
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:17.600]  And you know what that means. It says, this is what you are seeing on YouTube with people being
[3:55:17.600 --> 3:55:23.760]  forcibly taken. They have violated quarantine. Food and essentials are then brought to you
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:30.240]  daily and delivered by special staff. Work and education conducted remotely by the Internet.
[3:55:30.880 --> 3:55:38.480]  Masks are in tight supply and can be very expensive and streets are empty. This is not in
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:45.040]  Wuhan. This is in the city of Chengdu, a city of 16 million. This is like a typical city in China.
[3:55:45.040 --> 3:55:52.240]  Their economy is at a standstill and this is because they're battling to get the infection
[3:55:52.240 --> 3:56:00.880]  down to where only under 1% will be dying of this disease and they think they can stamp it out.
[3:56:00.880 --> 3:56:08.240]  Imagine these conditions in America. Imagine trying to weld Americans into apartments or
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:13.840]  telling them they can only leave their house three days a week. One person per household can
[3:56:13.840 --> 3:56:19.440]  leave their house three days a week to go to a certain supermarket and return home. That's it.
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:28.320]  All other businesses closed. This country can't do it. So I'm thinking the Chinese don't consider
[3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:33.680]  that the Chinese bosses don't consider this a weakness. They think their ability to quarantine
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:41.440]  and stamp out this disease first is a big advantage. If we have 15% fatality rate because
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:48.320]  it's uncontrolled and our hospitals are overrun, our society will collapse. A period. I mean,
[3:56:48.320 --> 3:56:53.760]  it will be Sierra, Tango, Foxtrot hits the fan. You know what I'm talking about.
[3:56:54.560 --> 3:57:03.280]  Now, the only book I've written that's a total pandemic SHTF book is this one
[3:57:04.000 --> 3:57:08.240]  where a huge earthquake in the middle of the country takes out the entire infrastructure.
[3:57:09.200 --> 3:57:14.720]  But that's the level of what I think can be coming now. I think that Trump is absolutely
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:23.840]  incorrect comparing this to the flu. It does not have a 0.1 death rate. It has a 2% death rate
[3:57:23.840 --> 3:57:32.240]  with ICU support of 15% death rate when it's uncontrolled. Our cities will absolutely go berserk.
[3:57:32.240 --> 3:57:45.280]  And that's bringing us into an election. Imagine that. All right, I'll see you next Thursday.
