[00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.563]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this live Thursday edition.
[00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:36.209]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from Washington, D.C., just a few miles from the area of Maryland where CPAC is happening with five-hour lines of people attempting to get in to see Vice President Pence that is there right now.
[00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:42.112]  We have multiple reporter groups and other groups that we sponsor inside of the event.
[00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:57.555]  Hosting articles and videos and exclusive interviews to Band.Video, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, NationalFile.com, Summit.News and other great sites that we work with.
[00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:06.003]  And I am going to, in an hour, leave and Mike Adams will fully take over along with Alan Keyes and others who have done an amazing job.
[00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:13.685]  We're good to go.
[00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:48.837]  Miscarriage of justice, criminal behavior, in my view, unprecedented by this judge, Amy Berman Jackson.
[00:01:48.837 --> 00:02:02.282]  And just the brazen attempt of her with the deep state and the corrupt corporate media to try to engage in unbelievable criminal activity in public to set the precedent for a total judicial tyranny will also be exposed.
[00:02:02.282 --> 00:02:04.502]  Tyler Nixon is coming up as we speak.
[00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:06.623]  He'll be here, Roger Stone's personal lawyer.
[00:02:08.806 --> 00:02:11.367]  Has a lot of his own personal views on things.
[00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:19.668]  We know that Roger gets persecuted for whatever anyone he's associated with says or does, but Tyler Nixon has been very tough and not back down and threats the judge.
[00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:27.350]  He is a citizen and as a lawyer, a respected person, is going to give his views on this tyrannous Rex that we're dealing with.
[00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.891]  And of course, we went and bullhorned her at point blank range yesterday, exposing her crimes.
[00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:32.311]  So there's so much coming up today.
[00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:35.172]  Also, we're gonna have some clips of General Flynn's son.
[00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:43.149]  Came with a great patriot and war veteran to the event who we brought in from Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:51.114]  And we had a very good discussion last night that we're going to be airing coming up parts of in the fourth hour today.
[00:02:51.114 --> 00:02:53.436]  That'll be exclusively retransmitted here.
[00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:55.077]  It went out on the live stream last night.
[00:02:57.483 --> 00:02:57.663]  Thank you.
[00:03:12.663 --> 00:03:17.449]  So that's the blackmail, the corruption of Flynn is refusing to lie about the president.
[00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.352]  So you've got all these political prisoners on every side.
[00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:22.735]  Mike, I know that you're going to be taking over an hour.
[00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.837]  You're going to ride shotgun with us.
[00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:27.101]  But the minute and a half we have before break, tell us some of what's coming up.
[00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:36.112]  Well, we've got the CDC now warning us about a possible outbreak in Sonoma County, the first case in America that has an unknown origin.
[00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:40.576]  So we may have human-to-human transmission sustained in California right now.
[00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:43.478]  We had, of course, the mayor of San Francisco declare a state of emergency there.
[00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:46.241]  Also, San Diego County declaring a state of emergency.
[00:03:46.841 --> 00:04:05.185]  We've got hundreds of people under self-quarantine after passing through the Atlanta airport and also a flight attendant who served LAX airport with Korean Airlines has also tested positive and she served passengers from Israel as well as Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea.
[00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:09.266]  So a lot of huge breaking news coming up whenever we've got a chance, Alex.
[00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:11.586]  It's just it's a it's a it's a packed day.
[00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:13.547]  There's so much news breaking on every front.
[00:04:13.547 --> 00:04:15.628]  It's an unreal time.
[00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:18.089]  But those are the highlights right there.
[00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:25.893]  Let's get into Corona then for the next two segments because that ties into the news I just got that I've got to report to people and I don't really take any pleasure in this.
[00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:30.075]  I can tell you for a lot of reasons and I'm going to explain that when we come back on the other side.
[00:04:31.152 --> 00:04:33.694]  Everybody knows you get straight dealing here.
[00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:35.816]  I'm compulsive about it, so is Mike Adams.
[00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:36.717]  I just can't help it.
[00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:39.459]  We tell you what's really going on.
[00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:43.323]  And that's our superpower, is that we just don't hold back.
[00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:46.345]  And it's the key to everything.
[00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:48.207]  We're just going to break it all down on the other side.
[00:04:48.207 --> 00:04:50.049]  That's why they want us off air.
[00:04:50.049 --> 00:04:52.971]  We got the fact that this corrupt judge was rigging the jury.
[00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:53.872]  We exposed it.
[00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:54.693]  They called for my arrest.
[00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:55.794]  Well, go to hell.
[00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:57.475]  I'm going to tell the truth, you witch.
[00:04:57.475 --> 00:04:57.916]  Be right back.
[00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:58.236]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:03.558]  It's really smart to get high quality storable food at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:07.280]  It's also smart to drink filtered water with an Alexa Pure system.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.381]  It's one of the highest rated out there and extremely affordable.
[00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:15.242]  And it's just as important to have your immune system boosted during times like this.

[00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:37.713]  This is our flagship product.
[00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:40.875]  I'm so proud of it, and I had run out of it as well.
[00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:44.298]  So when I got it last week, when it came back in, I was so excited.
[00:05:44.298 --> 00:05:46.959]  It's now available at InfoWarstore.com.

[00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:04.414]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:13.225]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:13.225 --> 00:06:16.770]  We are live ladies and gentlemen and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:17.862 --> 00:06:19.063]  I am in D.C.
[00:06:19.063 --> 00:06:20.483]  I've not gone to CPAC yet.
[00:06:20.483 --> 00:06:24.506]  We've got crews there and media that we sponsor doing a lot of great interviews.
[00:06:24.506 --> 00:06:27.827]  And we'll have some highlights of that for you coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:31.609]  We've got Mr. Keyes coming up, former ambassador to the U.N.
[00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:32.650]  from the U.S.
[00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:40.174]  We also have obviously Mike Adams, who is captaining the ship from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:40.174 --> 00:06:43.875]  Let's get into it right now.
[00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.817]  Again, gut level, back five weeks ago,
[00:06:53.097 --> 00:06:53.537]  We're good to go.
[00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:24.843]  Does it mutate into something down the road worse?
[00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:32.429]  Because when they engineer these things, they can then have the sequences tested out in primates, in rats, in other creatures.
[00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:34.650]  Remember, this thing does attack bats.
[00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.891]  It does attack horses.
[00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:37.272]  It does attack dogs.
[00:07:37.272 --> 00:07:42.036]  And usually you don't have viruses that are across a bunch of different species.
[00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:43.617]  So it is a chimera.
[00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:45.519]  It's manufactured.
[00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:49.121]  And we know Obama allowed it to be sold in 2015 to the Chicoms.
[00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:50.282]  It was a big scandal.
[00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:50.923]  It was in major
[00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:56.090]  Journals, like Science and others, that this is insane.
[00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.611]  Even then, the scientific community criticized the CDC and Obama for allowing this.
[00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.691]  So, there's a plan behind this.
[00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:06.452]  Now, I don't think we know the exact plan, but we know it's a plan.
[00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:12.573]  It's like when you look out your window and you see robbers breaking into your garage, or, you know, in your neighbor's house.
[00:08:12.573 --> 00:08:16.933]  You don't know exactly what they're going after, but they got crowbars, they're wearing black masks, they're going in the house.
[00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:20.554]  So, I mean, this is artificial, this is an assault, and
[00:08:21.676 --> 00:08:26.846]  You've got the globals trying to collapse the economy, and you've got 2020, and you've got all this stuff going on.
[00:08:26.846 --> 00:08:29.510]  This is synthetic.
[00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.572]  The whole thing is synthetic.
[00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:34.059]  That doesn't mean we know exactly what's happening, but Mike Adams has huge breaking news.
[00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.201]  But I wanted to hit this first.
[00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:41.445]  We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them.
[00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:42.586]  We don't sell firearms.
[00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:50.092]  We promote the fact that you should go out, get basic training, and be self-sufficient, and learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[00:08:50.092 --> 00:08:51.653]  I mean, it's just what we're meant to do.
[00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:53.495]  It feels good when we do it.
[00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:55.917]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[00:08:55.917 --> 00:09:01.321]  And InfoWars, quite frankly, I've been spending half my time budgeting and cutting costs and
[00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:03.063]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:04.645]  I just rather be on air doing things.
[00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:10.511]  But a good three hours a day, four hours a day, I jack around trying to find money and then trying to fund things.
[00:09:10.511 --> 00:09:15.676]  In the old days, before we were totally deplatformed on a lot of stuff, I never had to worry about money.
[00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:20.468]  Because I would just do enough to get the money that we needed and I was dumb.
[00:09:20.468 --> 00:09:24.510]  I actually didn't try to build up a bunch of money in case problems ever came.
[00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:33.736]  I mean, I built our own infrastructure to get news out and I saved some money, but I started going through that this year and I just prayed and God said, hey, it's going to be taken care of.
[00:09:33.736 --> 00:09:36.598]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:42.101]  We have caught up on a lot of our shortfalls and problems and even had to mortgage my house to keep operating.
[00:09:43.202 --> 00:09:48.606]  But as soon as I, the widows might have paid it in, the money came in, but it came because of the virus.
[00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:51.428]  Because people know I have the biggest horrible food company as a sponsor.
[00:09:51.428 --> 00:09:54.610]  They know they're a high-quality company with great food at great prices.
[00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.931]  They undercut everybody, folks.
[00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:01.454]  And I've been talking to them, and I mean, it's real.
[00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:07.078]  They sent me the documents, they sent me the emails, and it's not that I even demand it, they just know, you give me everything you've got.
[00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:11.519]  Even though it's, you know, restricted, I'm partners with them, so I get all that stuff.
[00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:15.881]  The government documents, the FEMA, you know, basically demanding their food.
[00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.302]  Everything else is sold out.
[00:10:17.302 --> 00:10:18.863]  So here's the development.
[00:10:18.863 --> 00:10:21.924]  And this isn't just about pitching food, because food's about to be gone.
[00:10:21.924 --> 00:10:24.486]  It's about understanding what's really going on in the back end.
[00:10:24.486 --> 00:10:28.008]  And only being in the middle of something like this would you even get that perspective.
[00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:31.529]  So again, the Lord works in mysterious ways again.
[00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:34.191]  But obviously,
[00:10:35.063 --> 00:10:38.364]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:39.504]  I said, I think this is gonna be really big.
[00:10:39.504 --> 00:10:40.884]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[00:10:40.884 --> 00:10:44.505]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:46.045]  And I said, no, I think this is gonna be huge.
[00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:50.366]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.166]  They agreed.
[00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:52.367]  So those are the type of discussions we had.
[00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:56.367]  And I'm just giving you the inside baseball of all of this.
[00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:59.608]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus.
[00:10:59.608 --> 00:11:01.228]  It was a hundred times a few days ago.
[00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:02.029]  Now it's about 200 times, okay?
[00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:09.843]  We tried to order from all these other suppliers just to see what you really get from other names.
[00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:11.765]  Use personal names, things like that.
[00:11:11.765 --> 00:11:13.566]  Four weeks later, no food came in.
[00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:21.652]  Big national talk show hosts are pitching stuff that has Patriot in the name, and it hasn't come in four weeks.
[00:11:21.652 --> 00:11:24.474]  We ordered from other people, didn't come.
[00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:26.135]  People that said seven days.
[00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:32.960]  When we tell you four or five weeks, that's the date when you order it with people bean counting to make sure that's the case.
[00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:43.589]  It upsets me, because people need to have affordable food, that there are other companies and groups out there that are telling people they have food and they don't have it.
[00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:44.449]  Okay?
[00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:46.870]  So, the good news is we tell the truth.
[00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.710]  Here's the bad news.
[00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.651]  I have today to tell you that it's now five weeks.
[00:11:54.651 --> 00:12:01.133]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this.
[00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:02.513]  Right now the folks running the plants.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.781]  To get the best idea we have.
[00:12:05.781 --> 00:12:08.743]  Today, it's five weeks.
[00:12:08.743 --> 00:12:13.666]  But they want me to say six to eight weeks, just so people aren't getting pissed.
[00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:21.471]  But understand, the last food company, the biggest food company, is now at hundreds of times their regular order.
[00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:26.234]  And they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week.
[00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.021]  And at a certain point, just saying, we're done.
[00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.645]  Because people aren't going to take food orders out 10 weeks.
[00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:35.548]  People, we don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks.
[00:12:35.548 --> 00:12:37.790]  And then just all the weirdness that comes with that.
[00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.011]  Because we're honest.
[00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:40.533]  So we're having those discussions right now.
[00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:42.535]  It's five weeks right now.
[00:12:42.535 --> 00:12:45.097]  At InfoWarsTore.com, you go right in the queue.
[00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:45.858]  First come, first serve.
[00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:48.258]  But it's My Patriot Supply is our partner.
[00:12:48.258 --> 00:12:49.258]  They're in our computer.
[00:12:49.258 --> 00:12:50.359]  It's the same as ordering from them.
[00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:53.920]  It just funds information warfare with the 20% or so we get.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.521]  And it's helped us.
[00:12:55.521 --> 00:12:58.302]  But we don't want to help ourselves stay on air with something bad like this.
[00:12:58.302 --> 00:12:59.763]  But this is our model.
[00:12:59.763 --> 00:13:01.103]  We're here to be independent.
[00:13:01.103 --> 00:13:07.006]  And we're proud of the fact we were pre-positioned because we're pre-positioned for information war, for physical war, for everything.
[00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:07.546]  It's what we do.
[00:13:07.546 --> 00:13:10.627]  We're about being on our hind feet, ready to fight.
[00:13:10.627 --> 00:13:11.567]  We fight.
[00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:13.128]  So we fight for a good future.
[00:13:13.128 --> 00:13:14.008]  We fight for our children.
[00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:14.469]  We're ready.
[00:13:14.469 --> 00:13:15.349]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:23.425]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra massive that it's, I was like, is it a hundred times?
[00:13:23.425 --> 00:13:25.726]  It's probably more like 150, 200 times.
[00:13:25.726 --> 00:13:27.827]  We just, it's dizzying.
[00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:29.788]  They already turned on a fourth plant.
[00:13:29.788 --> 00:13:36.532]  They're about to turn on a fifth and a sixth with, you know, the federal governments and all these big plants.
[00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:39.413]  I mean, these are the huge 200,000 square foot deals.
[00:13:39.413 --> 00:13:39.874]  We've been there.
[00:13:39.874 --> 00:13:40.914]  We've shown you video.
[00:13:40.914 --> 00:13:42.235]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.359]  These other companies are fly-by-night.
[00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:44.899]  They don't do that.
[00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:50.461]  They sit on some crap food, sell it, keep their money, and then hope later there's not too many chargebacks or whatever.
[00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:52.042]  We don't do that.
[00:13:52.042 --> 00:13:54.043]  It's five weeks today.
[00:13:54.043 --> 00:13:56.524]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[00:13:56.524 --> 00:13:58.225]  It's probably more like five or six.
[00:13:58.225 --> 00:14:02.526]  That's just inside baseball starting tomorrow.
[00:14:02.526 --> 00:14:08.129]  And then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:08.269]  So,
[00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:11.143]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[00:14:11.143 --> 00:14:13.386]  But that's how big this is.
[00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:23.057]  With the federal government and major corporations, four weeks ago, basically threatening people, well, you know, there may be a national emergency, we'll just make you sell it to us.
[00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:27.166]  And I'm really working to get people on air to tell you that face-to-face.
[00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:30.509]  So what you're getting is a 100% straight deal of what's going on.
[00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:31.810]  Infowarsware.com.
[00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.570]  So it's bittersweet.
[00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.331]  Everybody needs food.
[00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.272]  I'm proud we're selling high-quality food.
[00:14:35.272 --> 00:14:38.454]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble.
[00:14:38.454 --> 00:14:42.056]  This is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:42.617]  But for me,
[00:14:43.869 --> 00:14:52.493]  It just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and that this could really help InfoWars expand and do all these great things while you get prepared at the same time.
[00:14:52.493 --> 00:14:58.056]  But I'm looking down the barrel of, no, we're going to be honest and just say, we just can't handle it.
[00:14:58.056 --> 00:14:59.236]  It's too big.
[00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:02.558]  And, you know, we're not going to open 10 factories to get all this out.
[00:15:02.558 --> 00:15:04.919]  So it's at five weeks right now.
[00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:07.280]  It's really going to be like six weeks the next few days.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.601]  So they're saying six to eight weeks to get you a buffer.
[00:15:10.564 --> 00:15:20.346]  Under promise, over delivered, but technically it's going to be six to eight weeks and I'll be on the phone when I get off today with the CEO and with the owner of MyPatriot to decide what we're going to announce.
[00:15:20.346 --> 00:15:30.048]  We're all in Simpatico right now to make sure that we take care of you because we're all family in this and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back again.
[00:15:30.048 --> 00:15:31.788]  We want relationships with you.
[00:15:31.788 --> 00:15:33.709]  We're not Satanists, we're the opposite.
[00:15:33.709 --> 00:15:34.189]  We don't screw
[00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.446]  We believe in Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you.
[00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:39.848]  We're all in this together.
[00:15:39.848 --> 00:15:43.151]  Something big is going on with this whole situation.
[00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:48.937]  So we're going to break down the latest science, the latest developments with one of the leading experts out there, Mike Adams, on the other side.

[00:17:27.512 --> 00:17:28.732]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:17:28.732 --> 00:17:32.653]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:32.653 --> 00:17:34.194]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:34.194 --> 00:17:37.155]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:42.716]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:17:42.716 --> 00:17:43.916]  I can help you, too.
[00:17:43.916 --> 00:17:46.857]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:49.078]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:17:49.078 --> 00:17:53.519]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:55.820]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:17:58.874 --> 00:18:00.574]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:18:00.574 --> 00:18:02.695]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[00:18:02.695 --> 00:18:04.455]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:18:04.455 --> 00:18:06.176]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:11.537]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:18:11.537 --> 00:18:13.397]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:18:13.397 --> 00:18:14.698]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:16.458]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:17.918]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:18:17.918 --> 00:18:20.639]  And I want to expand to face the globalists, not contract.
[00:18:20.639 --> 00:18:21.779]  I don't want them to win.
[00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:22.600]  So listen.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.740]  You've got this guarantee from me.
[00:18:24.707 --> 00:18:27.809]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:30.971]  And we'll expand and really give the globals a run for their money.
[00:18:30.971 --> 00:18:34.754]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:18:34.754 --> 00:18:36.335]  These will change your life.

[00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:09.510]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.950]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:21.732]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:04.497]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.207 --> 00:20:27.793]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:29.554]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:29.554 --> 00:20:33.837]  I'm getting ready to saddle up in the War Wagon and get over to CPAC here.
[00:20:33.837 --> 00:20:37.999]  In about 40 minutes, Mike Adams will be taking over.
[00:20:37.999 --> 00:20:45.283]  But you heard the fact that I just broke down that we have the only storable food company that's got any real food that they actually deliver.
[00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:50.749]  We did a test, and I told them, I said, if this gets really bad, I said, you need to buy all the food forward.
[00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:51.430]  That's my advice.
[00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.610]  They did that.
[00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.911]  That was already what they wanted to do.
[00:20:53.911 --> 00:20:54.931]  They didn't do what I told them.
[00:20:54.931 --> 00:20:57.673]  I just agreed with what they were saying.
[00:20:57.673 --> 00:20:59.273]  But I told them, I said, I'm going to check with other people.
[00:20:59.273 --> 00:21:00.714]  I think it's going to be so bad.
[00:21:00.714 --> 00:21:04.136]  And they said, yeah, everybody else has sold out, or it's crap.
[00:21:04.136 --> 00:21:04.796]  We made orders.
[00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:06.057]  It never came.
[00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:09.058]  They lied to us and said seven days with all the companies.
[00:21:09.058 --> 00:21:10.339]  We didn't do that.
[00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:14.040]  We told you up front, seven to 14 days, and then we had to expand it out.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.161]  It's at five weeks right now.
[00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:21.740]  And that's not a gamble, but they feel nervous about even saying that.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.621]  I mean, because we're taking people's money here.
[00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:27.663]  So we're going to probably say eight weeks by tomorrow morning.
[00:21:27.663 --> 00:21:29.423]  Six to eight weeks, just to be safe.
[00:21:29.423 --> 00:21:31.004]  And we have the food.
[00:21:31.004 --> 00:21:32.504]  They've got the food.
[00:21:32.504 --> 00:21:35.846]  It's just, it's not easy to turn on huge factories.
[00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:36.746]  Okay.
[00:21:36.746 --> 00:21:38.107]  So I'm going to stop right there.
[00:21:38.107 --> 00:21:41.488]  But Mike Adams, why do you think the ordering of food is so seismic right now?
[00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:44.109]  And then let's get into the latest on the coronavirus developments.
[00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:47.838]  Well Alex, I've got a couple of bombshell things I've been trying to get to you.
[00:21:47.838 --> 00:21:50.962]  Things that you personally need to absolutely need to know.
[00:21:50.962 --> 00:21:53.845]  Big bombshell points, but first to answer your question.
[00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:57.489]  The reason is because in Italy the food supplies were wiped out overnight.
[00:21:57.489 --> 00:22:03.396]  The armed roadblock quarantines went into place overnight in Italy around 10 to 12 towns.
[00:22:04.878 --> 00:22:12.326]  You can be living in America today, in Michigan, in Denver, in Los Angeles, and you can think everything's fine.
[00:22:12.326 --> 00:22:17.111]  Literally in one day, you can be cut off from your grocery store.
[00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:20.895]  Now, if there are quarantines of entire cities, can UPS
[00:22:21.596 --> 00:22:23.096]  Even delivered to those cities?
[00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:25.277]  I don't even know how that works.
[00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:27.898]  UPS hasn't said anything about it, or FedEx, or the U.S.
[00:22:27.898 --> 00:22:28.158]  Mail.
[00:22:28.158 --> 00:22:33.479]  I don't know how that works, but the bottom line is the sooner you get in the queue, the faster you're going to get your food.
[00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:41.042]  And if you're not in the queue now, your window of opportunity is slamming shut so rapidly.
[00:22:41.042 --> 00:22:41.542]  Exactly.
[00:22:41.542 --> 00:22:42.322]  And folks, I'll tell you,
[00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:53.157]  By the time you buy food at the grocery store, it's got a five, six-time markup on it because of the infrastructure, the deliveries, the insurance, the employees, and the lawsuits, and people falling down saying they broke their back.
[00:22:53.157 --> 00:22:55.658]  But with us, the markup's not there.
[00:22:55.658 --> 00:22:59.020]  You're getting food the cheapest you're going to find it for any decent quality.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.301]  I'm not pitching food anymore.
[00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:03.263]  I'm personally just going to tell listeners this.
[00:23:03.263 --> 00:23:10.528]  I am telling you, you need to go to the grocery store and you need to stock up on essentials, even though you're going to be paying five, seven times what you should.
[00:23:11.498 --> 00:23:14.305]  From, you know, in Fort Worth, where I come, you need.
[00:23:14.305 --> 00:23:17.332]  But and separately, Mike, this is even a pitch here.
[00:23:17.332 --> 00:23:18.936]  I'm calling back home.
[00:23:18.936 --> 00:23:20.460]  I'm out of town and my parents have my children.
[00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:24.328]  Uh, saying, hey, give them elderberry, uh, you know, give them DNA force.
[00:23:24.328 --> 00:23:25.788]  Make sure they take their X2.
[00:23:25.788 --> 00:23:27.288]  Make sure they go to sleep early at night.
[00:23:27.288 --> 00:23:29.149]  Make sure they get plenty of red meat.
[00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:32.630]  Uh, I would never put them on an airplane right now, but, but I'm digressing.
[00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.930]  You're going to have the next few hours to get into all this.
[00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.531]  I know, uh, keys takes over at one o'clock.
[00:23:36.531 --> 00:23:40.332]  You should do the whole next hour by yourself, Mike, because I know this is so critical and people love keys.
[00:23:40.332 --> 00:23:41.672]  They need to hear from you.
[00:23:41.672 --> 00:23:46.393]  So I'm sorry I have you hosting and I ended up taking over while the horses couldn't drag me away, but it just hit me.
[00:23:47.381 --> 00:23:54.273]  This is a martial law global drill, and I think they know the global economy, the models show can't be inflated anymore.
[00:23:54.273 --> 00:23:57.478]  We've already said this, but now I know this is a reset.
[00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.663]  This, I think, is going to be used for a planetary
[00:24:02.032 --> 00:24:03.333]  Absolutely.
[00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:05.153]  There's a trap being set for Trump.
[00:24:05.153 --> 00:24:08.655]  This is one of the urgent messages I got to share with you.
[00:24:08.655 --> 00:24:15.157]  But first, just to answer your question, you know, as a food scientist myself, I run a food science lab, I do want to mention to people, like what you just said,
[00:24:27.202 --> 00:24:33.347]  You need to go to the grocery store and buy the things that can't be in storable foods, which typically includes a lot of oils.
[00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:39.592]  So you need to stock up on olive oil, peanut butter, even lard can be used to enhance the food.
[00:24:39.592 --> 00:24:51.301]  So when you buy the storable food and you want to stretch it because you didn't buy enough and you have five family members to feed, you can take the chicken flavored rice that you got from Infowars store and you can literally add lard to it.
[00:24:51.301 --> 00:24:52.742]  I'm not even joking.
[00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:53.422]  Add lard to it.
[00:24:53.422 --> 00:24:55.164]  A scoop of lard and it boosts it all.
[00:24:55.464 --> 00:24:57.607]  I know, and it sounds like people are like, what are you talking about?
[00:24:57.607 --> 00:24:58.808]  Health Rangers promoting lard.
[00:24:58.808 --> 00:25:00.791]  Hey, I'm also a prepper.
[00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:04.596]  I've got butter, I've got olive oil, I've got lard supplies.
[00:25:04.596 --> 00:25:05.697]  I'm not even kidding.
[00:25:05.697 --> 00:25:06.798]  Exactly.
[00:25:06.798 --> 00:25:09.181]  People need to get raw, storable calories.
[00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:10.685]  That's right!
[00:25:10.685 --> 00:25:12.306]  And peanut butter is a great way to do it.
[00:25:12.306 --> 00:25:14.488]  And peanut butter has a limited shelf life.
[00:25:14.488 --> 00:25:20.172]  And by the way, out of China, the honey supplies are now getting wiped out because all the honeybees are locked down.
[00:25:20.172 --> 00:25:22.594]  I mean the honey, the beekeepers, excuse me.
[00:25:22.594 --> 00:25:30.120]  I guess the honeybees themselves, they don't... Yeah, they've got drones flying around telling people not to even be outside the farms.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.283]  Which by the way, why would they tell farmers don't be in a field?
[00:25:33.283 --> 00:25:34.484]  You're not going to get coronavirus there.
[00:25:35.816 --> 00:25:42.762]  No, but what happens is all these food producers in China, they have to take their food into the cities in order to get processed and then exported.
[00:25:42.762 --> 00:25:46.605]  And that's why you see all the eggs and the milk all back to the front of the bag.
[00:25:46.605 --> 00:25:47.866]  That's right.
[00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:51.589]  Chicken supplies and meat supplies, they're all just getting just completely devastated.
[00:25:51.589 --> 00:25:54.492]  Mike, let me ask you that question, and we're going to come back and get more into this, the tolerances coming in.
[00:25:55.316 --> 00:26:00.622]  Why would China lock down whole cities, killing its economy like this, unless this is super deadly?
[00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:02.644]  None of this makes sense.
[00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:03.265]  No, no.
[00:26:03.265 --> 00:26:07.089]  People who are saying this is no big deal, they are clueless.
[00:26:07.089 --> 00:26:10.752]  China would not sacrifice their economy for a hoax.
[00:26:10.752 --> 00:26:11.733]  This is real.
[00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:14.677]  And we only got... Look, let me get to this, Alex.
[00:26:14.677 --> 00:26:15.578]  This is so crucial.
[00:26:15.578 --> 00:26:15.818]  Please.
[00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:24.601]  Yesterday, Trump held that press conference and he said that America is very, very ready for the coronavirus possibilities.
[00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:27.002]  And he said, oh, we're really close to a vaccine.
[00:26:27.002 --> 00:26:30.123]  Well, the person that's whispering in Trump's ear is Dr. Fauci.
[00:26:31.303 --> 00:26:44.488]  From the NIH, who we now know is one of the people who has funneled NIH money into bioweapons research and vaccine research, thanks to Francis Boyle telling us the truth about the death science industry.
[00:26:44.488 --> 00:26:54.512]  So we now have President Trump, just like we said, Alex, being, we believe, misinformed by the very same people who caused this problem.
[00:26:54.512 --> 00:27:00.394]  It's their weapon that got loose, and now they claim that they're going to be the saviors, and they are advising the President.
[00:27:00.914 --> 00:27:04.879]  I think the president has made a crucial mistake and he's being set up for a trap.
[00:27:04.879 --> 00:27:07.822]  The CDC has withheld testing kits.
[00:27:07.822 --> 00:27:12.587]  There have only been 445 tests conducted nationwide from day one.
[00:27:12.587 --> 00:27:13.168]  Period.
[00:27:13.168 --> 00:27:13.889]  By the CDC.
[00:27:13.889 --> 00:27:14.209]  That's it. 445.
[00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:18.213]  Well, South Korea has tested over 28,000 people.
[00:27:18.213 --> 00:27:20.074]  China has tested hundreds of thousands.
[00:27:20.074 --> 00:27:23.937]  Other nations are out testing America by factors of 100 to 1.
[00:27:23.937 --> 00:27:25.818]  And Trump says we're ready.
[00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:28.360]  So we know the deep state blocks Trump at every level.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.041]  And they're medically blocking him again.
[00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:32.603]  And when it's a huge disaster, they're going to blame Trump.
[00:27:32.603 --> 00:27:33.864]  They're going to blame Trump.
[00:27:33.864 --> 00:27:35.105]  The trap has been set.
[00:27:35.865 --> 00:27:45.429]  And the CDC testing protocols, this is the other big bombshell, there was a case of human-to-human transmission in Sonoma County confirmed last night, even the Washington Post covered it.
[00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:53.913]  That case would normally never have been tested because that person didn't travel from China and was not in close contact with a known confirmed person.
[00:27:53.913 --> 00:28:00.456]  So under CDC guidelines... Mike, Mike, Mike, we'll talk more about this when we come back, but I personally am having a lot of anxiety.
[00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:05.173]  And when I was a kid, I ignored it, you know, as an adult, but now I've learned to go with it.
[00:28:05.173 --> 00:28:06.194]  It's always right.
[00:28:06.194 --> 00:28:07.915]  What do you think my big anxiety is about?
[00:28:07.915 --> 00:28:08.995]  Is it the trap against Trump?
[00:28:08.995 --> 00:28:10.056]  Is it the economy?
[00:28:10.056 --> 00:28:12.098]  Or is it the virus is really that deadly?
[00:28:12.098 --> 00:28:16.761]  It's that if the deep state plan follows as planned,
[00:28:17.361 --> 00:28:28.625]  That in November, we will have a President Bernie Sanders, a communist, with medical, martial law, forced vaccinations, and the criminalization of any anti-vaxxers across the area.
[00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:31.165]  That's it, because now the Democrats officially endorse Sanders.
[00:28:31.165 --> 00:28:32.846]  They're going with the commie program.
[00:28:33.724 --> 00:28:36.225]  That's the scenario that they want to achieve.
[00:28:36.225 --> 00:28:41.908]  A communist in the White House, total medical martial law, quarantines, criminalization of people like you and I, Alex.
[00:28:41.908 --> 00:28:45.470]  They want us in prison while they have mandatory communist control over everything.
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.251]  Mike Adams has cracked the code again.
[00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:47.731]  That's it.
[00:28:47.731 --> 00:28:54.974]  I was thinking about yesterday, reading about Sanders being officially endorsed, how they're lining him up against Trump during a martial law scenario.
[00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:57.876]  They use the fear and hysteria to remove Trump because we're so scared of the virus.
[00:28:57.876 --> 00:29:02.098]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:02.438 --> 00:29:04.518]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:04.518 --> 00:29:06.259]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:06.259 --> 00:29:12.800]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.881]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:26.143]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:26.143 --> 00:29:30.844]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[00:29:31.084 --> 00:29:33.145]  And totally change your life.
[00:29:33.145 --> 00:29:38.329]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:41.631]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[00:29:41.631 --> 00:29:42.591]  Get clean.
[00:29:42.591 --> 00:29:44.413]  Call now and learn more.

[00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:44.693]  800-506-6740.
[00:29:44.693 --> 00:29:44.913]  That's 800-506-6740.
[00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:01.902]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[00:30:01.902 --> 00:30:08.885]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[00:30:08.885 --> 00:30:19.330]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key co-factors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:26.053]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[00:30:26.053 --> 00:30:27.034]  It is back in stock.

[00:30:43.702 --> 00:30:44.163]  And of course,
[00:30:45.023 --> 00:30:51.754]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[00:30:51.754 --> 00:30:57.843]  And they're both back in stock, 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:30:59.847 --> 00:31:00.628]  Real stuff, man.
[00:31:00.628 --> 00:31:01.809]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:07.276]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[00:31:07.276 --> 00:31:10.140]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.842]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[00:31:11.842 --> 00:31:15.086]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[00:31:15.626 --> 00:31:19.489]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[00:31:19.489 --> 00:31:20.730]  20 different stickers.
[00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.352]  Impeach the Democrats.
[00:31:22.352 --> 00:31:23.413]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:31:23.413 --> 00:31:24.513]  Defend the First Amendment.
[00:31:24.513 --> 00:31:25.835]  Infowars.com.
[00:31:25.835 --> 00:31:28.016]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[00:31:28.016 --> 00:31:32.800]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.362]  People say, why are you doing this?
[00:31:34.362 --> 00:31:34.902]  What's happening?
[00:31:34.902 --> 00:31:38.665]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:41.788]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[00:31:42.028 --> 00:31:42.789]  Brilliant.
[00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:49.895]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[00:31:49.895 --> 00:31:52.858]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:55.661]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:56.361]  Silence.
[00:31:58.382 --> 00:32:01.404]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.

[00:33:31.653 --> 00:33:39.220]  Mike Adams just last week told me, hey, I know you're pitching for herbal food and that's great, but what are you personally doing for yourself?
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.362]  And I said, well, I'm taking the normal supplements.

[00:33:56.873 --> 00:34:00.534]  We have the Ultra 12 that gives other foundational for the whole body.
[00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:02.795]  High quality Vitamin B12, take it out of the tongue.
[00:34:02.795 --> 00:34:04.356]  It's the best you can find out there.
[00:34:04.356 --> 00:34:05.576]  Super strong.
[00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:07.697]  Every time you change the formula, you got to change the name.
[00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:10.798]  So Secret 12 went to Ultra 12, got twice as strong.
[00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:11.919]  Same stuff.
[00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:16.000]  And then Vitamin Roll Fusion, Vitamins, Minerals, Amino Acids.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.781]  It's simple stuff like that.
[00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.891]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:21.271]  We're sold out of the winter sun.
[00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:23.112]  We have ultimate fish oil.
[00:34:23.112 --> 00:34:24.792]  It's got three different fish oils.
[00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:27.173]  Great source of vitamin D spectrum.
[00:34:27.173 --> 00:34:28.574]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:34:28.574 --> 00:34:33.615]  So food is important and a shotgun at bare minimum to protect you and your family.
[00:34:33.615 --> 00:34:35.716]  The globalists are trying to collapse the economy right now.
[00:34:35.716 --> 00:34:36.696]  They're making their move.
[00:34:36.696 --> 00:34:40.118]  This is their strike back at what Trump and all of us have done.
[00:34:41.588 --> 00:34:47.094]  And so they're going to try to use this to change our mind about politics and accept status control.
[00:34:47.094 --> 00:34:54.282]  That's why Trump's been playing everything down when all these other countries like Italy and others are playing it up.
[00:34:54.282 --> 00:34:56.384]  Italy was taken back over by communists.
[00:34:56.384 --> 00:34:58.126]  I'm not saying there isn't real cases.
[00:34:58.126 --> 00:34:58.827]  People aren't dying.
[00:34:59.696 --> 00:35:02.839]  But the statists are using this for control.
[00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:04.360]  So we take it as serious.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.321]  We respond.
[00:35:05.321 --> 00:35:07.162]  We get prepared.
[00:35:07.162 --> 00:35:08.643]  But something bigger is here.
[00:35:08.643 --> 00:35:09.564]  And I agree with Mike Adams.
[00:35:09.564 --> 00:35:11.386]  He's aligned the planets here.
[00:35:11.386 --> 00:35:16.630]  This is a move against our economy and against America and against nationalists worldwide.
[00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.311]  How do we counter that, Mike Adams?
[00:35:18.311 --> 00:35:19.813]  For a few minutes before I bring in Tyler next.
[00:35:20.313 --> 00:35:21.954]  Well, I do want to mention one thing.
[00:35:21.954 --> 00:35:34.739]  When you talk about the five-week wait time right now on your food supplies, it's important for your customers to know that when they order other things like Vitamineral Fusion, that that's actually fulfilled out of Austin, and those are fulfilled immediately.
[00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:38.821]  So the wait time... I'm so glad I should have... No, that's fulfilled the next day.
[00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:39.662]  Exactly.
[00:35:40.842 --> 00:35:41.302]  Exactly.
[00:35:41.302 --> 00:35:48.248]  So the food is coming from a different warehouse, from a different shipper, and the wait time only applies to the food.
[00:35:48.248 --> 00:35:52.831]  I wonder why our sales of vitamins and stuff went down, because people think we don't have that.
[00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:53.332]  No, no.
[00:35:53.332 --> 00:35:54.993]  We ship out of Austin all of that.
[00:35:55.686 --> 00:35:58.808]  My Patriot is hooked into our computers.
[00:35:58.808 --> 00:36:03.110]  We're partners, and that goes out of Utah and Colorado and other places.
[00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.011]  They have factories.
[00:36:04.011 --> 00:36:05.031]  Right, exactly.
[00:36:05.031 --> 00:36:13.976]  And I know this because, you know, of course, I run an entire warehouse operation myself, so I know that your team here in Austin actually... You've got great products, by the way, at naturalnews.com.
[00:36:13.976 --> 00:36:16.858]  You've got great immune boosting formulas at naturalnews.com.
[00:36:16.858 --> 00:36:17.258]  Well, thank you.
[00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:19.900]  I just want to say, your warehouse is keeping up.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.420]  We are not.
[00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:25.776]  We're backlogged, but your warehouse is keeping up, so your items are able to ship out right now.
[00:36:25.776 --> 00:36:35.003]  But a big breaking item today is that for the first time, South Korea reported infections have now eclipsed China's numbers.
[00:36:35.003 --> 00:36:37.305]  So this is now way beyond China.
[00:36:37.305 --> 00:36:39.106]  Oh, that's way beyond bombshell.
[00:36:39.106 --> 00:36:41.127]  China's covered it up, South Korea's not.
[00:36:41.127 --> 00:36:41.768]  That's what we now know.
[00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:43.029]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:43.029 --> 00:36:48.074]  So when a nation actually does the testing and tells the truth, we see explosive exponential growth.
[00:36:48.074 --> 00:36:49.916]  I want to stop you there.
[00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:50.937]  I want to stop you there.
[00:36:50.937 --> 00:36:51.998]  This is so huge.
[00:36:51.998 --> 00:36:53.660]  We should just pause a moment.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.423]  South Korea infections has outpaced China.
[00:36:57.423 --> 00:36:58.605]  We know that's not true.
[00:36:58.605 --> 00:36:59.646]  China's been covering it up.
[00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:03.890]  So now we're getting better reporting from a country that's well known for telling the truth about stuff.
[00:37:04.975 --> 00:37:05.935]  This is bad news.
[00:37:05.935 --> 00:37:06.375]  That's right.
[00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:11.356]  And just to be clear, the aggregate number is not yet as high as China, but I'm talking about the daily number now.
[00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:14.717]  Today's numbers out of South Korea are larger than today's numbers out of China.
[00:37:14.717 --> 00:37:17.217]  So this outbreak is uncontained.
[00:37:17.217 --> 00:37:18.757]  It's going to go global.
[00:37:18.757 --> 00:37:21.258]  Paul Joseph Watson recently, or yesterday, had a story.
[00:37:21.258 --> 00:37:29.319]  UK government document warns that coronavirus could infect 80% of the people in the United Kingdom and kill half a million Brits.
[00:37:29.319 --> 00:37:31.200]  That's a leaked document.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.840]  Paul Joseph Watson is absolutely correct on that.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.301]  Other scientists are predicting.
[00:37:34.301 --> 00:37:35.603]  That article is so huge.
[00:37:35.603 --> 00:37:37.265]  I mean, that is huge.
[00:37:37.265 --> 00:37:38.466]  Absolutely.
[00:37:38.466 --> 00:37:42.932]  And then we have the... Oh, I don't normally just say every 10 seconds, this is huge, this is huge.
[00:37:42.932 --> 00:37:44.594]  I mean, this is just a crescendo.
[00:37:44.594 --> 00:37:49.199]  And the way the world works, when things crescendo, they tend to keep crescendoing.
[00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:52.363]  I get this feeling like we're about to see stuff get crazy, Mike.
[00:37:52.623 --> 00:37:56.244]  I can barely keep up myself, and I've got a whole editorial team like you do.
[00:37:56.244 --> 00:37:57.204]  We can barely keep up.
[00:37:57.204 --> 00:37:58.205]  But listen to this.
[00:37:58.205 --> 00:38:01.166]  Iranian Vice President now confirmed infected.
[00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:06.447]  So this is, and it's killed the Iranian ambassador to the Vatican now.
[00:38:06.447 --> 00:38:16.831]  And this is the man who, five days ago or so, was on video, sweating and obviously very sick, telling everybody that it's all under control, everything is fine.
[00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:19.371]  This is like a science fiction dystopia movie.
[00:38:19.371 --> 00:38:20.852]  I didn't even know this because I'm busy at CPAC.
[00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:25.273]  You're telling me that now government officials are dying?
[00:38:25.273 --> 00:38:26.254]  This shows... Yes.
[00:38:26.254 --> 00:38:30.320]  It's got to be very specific because we know the Iranians are mixed in with Asian bloodlines.
[00:38:31.113 --> 00:38:33.794]  Or is it a cover for another bio-attack on Iran?
[00:38:33.794 --> 00:38:35.075]  What the hell?
[00:38:35.075 --> 00:38:40.838]  Well, even when it has greater propensity for certain races, it's still highly dangerous for any race.
[00:38:40.838 --> 00:38:43.199]  So you have other people in Italy getting infected.
[00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:45.060]  You know, white people can get infected.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.200]  Europeans can get infected.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.542]  It's dangerous to everybody, but the infection rate is higher.
[00:38:49.542 --> 00:38:52.183]  Now, there was someone else... So you're saying, why is it so bad in Iran?
[00:38:53.294 --> 00:39:01.598]  Well, the people of that region have more ACE2 receptor sites in their respiratory systems.
[00:39:01.598 --> 00:39:06.761]  Not as much as people in Japan, by the way, or people in China, but more than people from Northern Europe.
[00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.542]  But the South China Morning
[00:39:09.102 --> 00:39:11.202]  Post has been covering this as well.
[00:39:11.202 --> 00:39:15.223]  And that, you know, that newspaper is kind of a little bit of a government mouthpiece.
[00:39:15.223 --> 00:39:19.504]  But even they are now admitting that there's an HIV component in the virus.
[00:39:19.504 --> 00:39:20.884]  They call it a mutation.
[00:39:20.884 --> 00:39:22.224]  It's not a mutation.
[00:39:22.224 --> 00:39:23.384]  It was engineered.
[00:39:23.384 --> 00:39:26.205]  And they say that it makes it super infectious now.
[00:39:26.205 --> 00:39:32.606]  So you have even the mainstream media of Asia now confirming what InfoWars reported three weeks ago.
[00:39:32.606 --> 00:39:38.087]  So, you know, once again, the media is catching up to what we were talking about weeks ago or a month ago.
[00:39:38.587 --> 00:39:42.374]  And by the way, Mike, I feel totally sick to my stomach that we've been proven right.
[00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:44.417]  There's no pleasure in any of this.
[00:39:44.417 --> 00:39:45.479]  It's disgusting.
[00:39:45.479 --> 00:39:49.105]  I almost feel guilty that I'm here at CPAC and not home in Austin.
[00:39:49.105 --> 00:39:50.748]  I almost feel guilty I'm on an airplane.
[00:39:51.656 --> 00:40:05.087]  Well, look, I know that you're taking every step to protect yourself because you're traveling, but Atlanta Airport has now, they've said that they have told 200 people who went through Atlanta to self-quarantine.
[00:40:05.087 --> 00:40:09.590]  And I've got a quote somewhere here from the general manager of the Atlanta Airport.
[00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.191]  Here it is.
[00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:12.332]  He says, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:40:12.332 --> 00:40:13.994]  He says, Atlanta is in good shape.
[00:40:14.901 --> 00:40:20.263]  Even though they've had 200 people put in a self-quarantine there, or... No, you can hear them parroting Trump.
[00:40:20.263 --> 00:40:21.584]  Trump thinks he's saving the economy.
[00:40:21.584 --> 00:40:23.445]  I get why he's doing this, but they're setting him up.
[00:40:23.445 --> 00:40:24.025]  You're right.
[00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:25.325]  It's gonna get really bad.
[00:40:25.325 --> 00:40:27.086]  They're setting Trump up.
[00:40:27.086 --> 00:40:28.167]  His name is John Selden.
[00:40:28.167 --> 00:40:32.789]  He says, quote, nationwide there has been only one person who has come through a U.S.
[00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:34.569]  airport with the virus.
[00:40:34.569 --> 00:40:35.370]  Are you kidding me?
[00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:36.750]  Are you kidding me?
[00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:42.213]  You think that in this nation, we still have flights to Korea, flights to Italy, flights to all these infected countries.
[00:40:42.213 --> 00:40:44.754]  You think there's only been one person come through a U.S.
[00:40:44.754 --> 00:40:45.634]  airport?
[00:40:45.634 --> 00:40:46.875]  You haven't learned, man!
[00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:50.596]  You're going to take over next hour, do the whole next hour, then Keyes will do the third hour.
[00:40:50.596 --> 00:40:54.818]  He's been doing a great job, but this is so important, so I'm just saying, do the next hour.
[00:40:54.818 --> 00:40:56.199]  We have Tyler Nixon here.
[00:40:57.128 --> 00:41:00.251]  People can say, OK, all this big stuff's going on.
[00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:01.152]  We have a judge.
[00:41:01.152 --> 00:41:02.053]  She rigged a jury.
[00:41:02.053 --> 00:41:03.114]  She's been caught.
[00:41:03.114 --> 00:41:03.795]  The government's corrupt.
[00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:04.196]  Big deal.
[00:41:04.196 --> 00:41:07.599]  No, they were beta testing this to roll it out everywhere.
[00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:10.542]  They admit that she's been caught rigging the jury.
[00:41:10.542 --> 00:41:14.166]  Now she's trying to suppress anyone finding out who else is on the jury.
[00:41:15.484 --> 00:41:19.087]  And Trump is right to press on this because it could bring down the whole deep state.
[00:41:19.087 --> 00:41:21.368]  It's bigger than Berman Jackson.
[00:41:21.368 --> 00:41:24.710]  This is about the fake FISA warrants.
[00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.292]  It's all about this system.
[00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:32.796]  So Roger Stone's personal lawyer, not the lawyer on the case, but his personal lawyer, Tyler Nixon, is here with us in Washington, D.C.
[00:41:32.796 --> 00:41:33.737]  right now.
[00:41:33.737 --> 00:41:36.599]  And this is a key to bringing down the deep state.
[00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:39.120]  So that's why we're covering it right now in the middle of this.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.242]  So give us three minutes to two minutes to break.
[00:41:41.242 --> 00:41:42.463]  Just give us a synopsis.
[00:41:42.463 --> 00:41:43.664]  We'll come back for a few seconds.
[00:41:43.664 --> 00:41:44.064]  Tyler Nixon.
[00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.570]  Sure.
[00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:52.813]  Well, you know, the current state of things is that Rogers are waiting for a decision from the judge on the motion for a new trial.
[00:41:52.813 --> 00:41:57.074]  Now, she's come out swinging against Tucker Carlson, against the president practically.
[00:41:57.074 --> 00:42:03.297]  I mean, I think this is really the most flailing judicial officer I've ever seen.
[00:42:03.297 --> 00:42:05.818]  And it's because I think she gets that
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.821]  She's the whole thing's exposed.
[00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:12.246]  I mean, you cannot have a juror with that much bias and call it a fair trial.
[00:42:12.246 --> 00:42:16.069]  And it's not a matter of, well, you know, she can explain it away.
[00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:22.436]  Clearly, there was bias before and the juror, if we were to believe the documents, she basically either lied or
[00:42:23.176 --> 00:42:29.818]  We're not just saying this.
[00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:32.439]  This is like textbook jury rigging.
[00:42:32.439 --> 00:42:35.540]  The judge is in there saying, oh, don't worry, she worked for Obama.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.761]  By the way, media don't report that.
[00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:38.521]  We have her!
[00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:39.481]  We have her!
[00:42:39.481 --> 00:42:41.482]  This is ridiculous!
[00:42:41.482 --> 00:42:49.184]  She said during the trial, basically like, well, the fact that you held a position in an opposite administration doesn't make it better.
[00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:50.571]  All right, stay there.
[00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:51.451]  Let's lay this out.
[00:42:51.451 --> 00:42:53.313]  This could bring down the whole deep state, folks.
[00:42:53.313 --> 00:42:55.094]  I smell blood.
[00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:58.236]  I smell blood of the globalists, politically, forever.
[00:42:58.236 --> 00:43:06.423]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[00:43:06.423 --> 00:43:07.003]  That's good.
[00:43:07.003 --> 00:43:09.405]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[00:43:09.405 --> 00:43:16.390]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.452]  We need to reverse this trend and start
[00:43:18.952 --> 00:43:27.618]  Getting prepared, and that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[00:43:27.618 --> 00:43:32.821]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[00:43:32.821 --> 00:43:41.107]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[00:43:41.107 --> 00:43:42.688]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now.
[00:43:44.289 --> 00:43:50.515]  Along with Ultra 12 and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[00:44:01.074 --> 00:44:02.715]  Owl killer in New Jersey.
[00:44:02.715 --> 00:44:03.295]  You're on the air.
[00:44:03.295 --> 00:44:04.176]  Go ahead, Alex.
[00:44:04.176 --> 00:44:06.637]  Hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[00:44:06.637 --> 00:44:09.719]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:15.002]  So that super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[00:44:15.002 --> 00:44:20.165]  I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[00:44:20.165 --> 00:44:22.966]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[00:44:22.966 --> 00:44:25.628]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[00:44:25.808 --> 00:44:33.910]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.250]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.230]  Support this man.
[00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.670]  Everything that he exposed.
[00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.091]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:40.211]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:41.511]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[00:44:41.511 --> 00:44:44.172]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[00:44:44.172 --> 00:44:46.012]  Go look it up yourself.
[00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:47.172]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[00:44:47.172 --> 00:44:48.372]  They definitely want us off the air.
[00:44:48.372 --> 00:44:49.292]  Without you, we're not here.
[00:44:49.292 --> 00:44:51.193]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[00:44:58.965 --> 00:45:00.126]  Don't be a victim.
[00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:04.988]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[00:45:04.988 --> 00:45:09.270]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.672]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[00:45:11.672 --> 00:45:15.133]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[00:45:15.133 --> 00:45:16.814]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:20.436]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[00:45:20.436 --> 00:45:24.138]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver
[00:45:24.398 --> 00:45:30.221]  That's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown that go after this whole Corona SARS family of viruses.
[00:45:30.221 --> 00:45:32.782]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[00:45:32.782 --> 00:45:37.384]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[00:45:37.384 --> 00:45:38.544]  Great to have, period.
[00:45:38.544 --> 00:45:40.125]  Really good for your gums, really great for your
[00:45:40.565 --> 00:45:43.206]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[00:45:43.206 --> 00:45:48.168]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[00:45:48.168 --> 00:45:51.689]  that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[00:45:51.689 --> 00:45:52.849]  There's a lot of patriots.
[00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:54.450]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:57.451]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[00:45:57.451 --> 00:45:58.191]  It's very exciting.
[00:45:59.051 --> 00:46:02.072]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high quality storable food.
[00:46:02.072 --> 00:46:03.793]  We sell it in fullrestore.com.
[00:46:03.793 --> 00:46:09.895]  But everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high quality at a great price because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:46:09.895 --> 00:46:12.696]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[00:46:12.696 --> 00:46:20.778]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, My Patriot, is now three to four weeks out before they ship food.
[00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.659]  They have the food, but they've got to package it.
[00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:26.944]  And any day now, they may come and tell me, oh sorry, we're not selling food anymore.
[00:46:26.944 --> 00:46:30.167]  Because they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[00:46:30.167 --> 00:46:33.351]  Now, you get your order in now, you get the high quality food.
[00:46:33.351 --> 00:46:36.334]  It's a smart move, it funds the M4, you can't lose.
[00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:38.317]  Take action at m4restore.com.
[00:46:38.317 --> 00:46:40.199]  Whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks.
[00:46:40.439 --> 00:46:41.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:21.144 --> 00:47:22.785]  And we are back with Tyler Nixon.
[00:47:22.785 --> 00:47:26.706]  He was ranting during that three-minute break or whatever.
[00:47:26.706 --> 00:47:29.547]  Tyler, you were just nailing it.
[00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:36.929]  Now they have Politico articles with major professors saying, oh, presidents can't pardon when Bill Clinton was pardoning cocaine dealers.
[00:47:38.015 --> 00:47:39.180]  All the rest of it.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.528]  This is their full assault on reality.
[00:47:41.528 --> 00:47:43.134]  This is desperation.
[00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:49.279]  Yeah, it shows you how they're willing to basically, this rule of law stuff and truth matters.
[00:47:49.279 --> 00:47:51.401]  That is the biggest bunch of bunk with these people.
[00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:59.106]  They are absolutely situation and context dependent on what side they take of things, whether they agree with the Constitution, whether it's against the Constitution.
[00:47:59.106 --> 00:48:10.994]  And you know, they are now, I mean, this is not, it's not a major law professor, but it's a law professor, someone who's teaching law students and a Brown University professor as well, says that the impeachment
[00:48:12.296 --> 00:48:23.620]  Because it says the pardon power accepts cases of impeachment, they're trying to read that as saying that he loses the pardon power merely by being impeached.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.501]  No, because the president can't pardon his own impeachment.
[00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:28.622]  Right, exactly.
[00:48:28.622 --> 00:48:32.483]  But he was not found guilty, and it's not an impeachment case.
[00:48:32.483 --> 00:48:33.623]  It's like Bergman Jackson saying,
[00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:39.398]  Trump is harassing a jury that months ago was done.
[00:48:39.398 --> 00:48:41.239]  We're just exposing the jury's rigged.
[00:48:41.239 --> 00:48:45.421]  Or Roger Stone being gagged after he's been convicted, when the whole premise of it was jury tainted.
[00:48:45.421 --> 00:48:46.442]  Never been done before.
[00:48:46.442 --> 00:48:47.762]  Never, never.
[00:48:47.762 --> 00:48:49.183]  So she's desperate.
[00:48:49.183 --> 00:48:50.884]  Here's the $20 trillion question.
[00:48:52.103 --> 00:48:56.064]  She's trying to suppress the names of the jurors when the Supreme Court says they shall be public.
[00:48:56.064 --> 00:48:57.585]  Not because we want to harass them.
[00:48:57.585 --> 00:49:01.866]  We want to see, well, the last foreman she tried to get worked as the head of the Department for Obama.
[00:49:01.866 --> 00:49:04.207]  Her husband worked for the Russia probe.
[00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:08.848]  The next woman's a DNC Brazil minion that ran for high office.
[00:49:08.848 --> 00:49:09.688]  These are operatives.
[00:49:09.688 --> 00:49:10.809]  We want to see the other ones.
[00:49:10.809 --> 00:49:16.790]  Well, no wonder she wants to keep it secret, because we know then that whole thing is stacked and packed.
[00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.651]  And then when that all comes out, it's bye-bye.
[00:49:19.651 --> 00:49:21.092]  You're going to prison, Ms.
[00:49:21.092 --> 00:49:21.552]  Jackson.
[00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:25.360]  I'd like to, I'm so glad you raised this point.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.602]  We do not have secret juries in the United States of America.
[00:49:28.602 --> 00:49:31.163]  That was one of the reasons this country was founded, okay?
[00:49:31.163 --> 00:49:33.764]  A secret jury is also called a star chamber.
[00:49:33.764 --> 00:49:37.385]  You cannot, the public, that's why we have public trials as well.
[00:49:37.385 --> 00:49:44.768]  We don't do things in secret, we don't have secret tribunals, except maybe in the case of like a military tribunal in the midst of an actual hot war.
[00:49:45.328 --> 00:49:54.390]  Other than that, though, the public has a right to know who these jurors are and also to, for themselves, verify, you know, what they say, such as Ms.
[00:49:54.390 --> 00:50:02.012]  Hart, who said she, you know, she never posted, or she doesn't think she posted anything on social media about Roger or the case or anything to do with that.
[00:50:02.012 --> 00:50:10.754]  And it turns out, you know, public, Mike Cernovich jumped in there and found out, no, you in fact did, which not only says she's partisan, but she also lied, basically, or tried to conceal.
[00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:15.515]  Stone's depiction proves Trump colluded with Russia.
[00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:16.516]  That's nowhere in there!
[00:50:16.516 --> 00:50:19.941]  I mean, this woman is a flame-throwing liar.
[00:50:19.941 --> 00:50:25.448]  Well, even, and similar along those lines, the pardon people are saying that, oh excuse me, there's another
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:36.762]  Another professor came out similarly saying the executive branch of pardon power should be checked by the judicial branch in cases where there's corruption involved and the abuse of power impeachment.
[00:50:36.762 --> 00:50:39.322]  They're trying to say they're claiming powers that aren't in the Constitution.
[00:50:39.322 --> 00:50:44.023]  How does Ukrainian phone call over which he was impeached have anything to do with Roger Stone and WikiLeaks or even anything?
[00:50:44.023 --> 00:50:44.603]  No, it doesn't.
[00:50:44.603 --> 00:50:47.284]  So let's just stop right there.
[00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:48.164]  They're desperate.
[00:50:48.164 --> 00:50:48.924]  They're losing.
[00:50:48.924 --> 00:50:50.564]  What are they going to do next?
[00:50:50.564 --> 00:50:51.864]  It's bigger than Roger Stone.
[00:50:51.864 --> 00:50:55.445]  It's bigger than Judge LaFraud Jackson.
[00:50:56.247 --> 00:50:56.908]  It's bigger.
[00:50:56.908 --> 00:51:03.852]  It's that they're this crazy, and they're attempting to overthrow jurisprudence and checks and balances.
[00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:06.534]  But the checks and balances the founders set up are defeating them.
[00:51:06.534 --> 00:51:08.916]  This is like masterwork of the founders.
[00:51:08.916 --> 00:51:10.937]  It just makes you go, man, who the hell are these guys?
[00:51:10.937 --> 00:51:12.818]  These are like Jedi warlords.
[00:51:12.818 --> 00:51:14.299]  So let's get Mike Adams' take on this.
[00:51:14.299 --> 00:51:15.160]  Mike, you're listening to this.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:29.164]  We have huge news with coronavirus and the economy and the globalists, but I mean, the fact that they were weaponizing the judiciary and admitted they were going to arrest all of Trump's supporters and that they're failing here, this is real victory.
[00:51:29.164 --> 00:51:32.165]  That's why I'm trying to drive this victory home.
[00:51:32.665 --> 00:51:49.070]  Well, the big picture, I believe, is not just involving Roger Stone and Judge Jackson, but the fact that the entire public of America will lose every last shred of remaining faith in the institutions of the rule of law, the judiciary, and the government itself.
[00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.292]  What happens to a society when the public loses faith in the system?
[00:51:53.292 --> 00:51:57.153]  This is a fourth turning moment, and that will be the collapse of
[00:51:58.293 --> 00:51:59.494]  No, I agree.
[00:51:59.494 --> 00:52:01.055]  So, Mike, I'm asking you.
[00:52:01.055 --> 00:52:01.655]  I respect you.
[00:52:01.655 --> 00:52:02.235]  I know.
[00:52:02.235 --> 00:52:03.356]  They're so reckless.
[00:52:03.356 --> 00:52:06.497]  They're killing every convention, all chivalry.
[00:52:06.497 --> 00:52:07.678]  They think chivalry is wimpy.
[00:52:07.678 --> 00:52:10.019]  No, it's so you don't burn everything down.
[00:52:10.019 --> 00:52:11.600]  So what are you expecting to do next?
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.742]  I mean, they're just like balls to the walls, zombie attack right now.
[00:52:15.742 --> 00:52:18.803]  Well, look, I don't want to take away from Tyler Nixon's time.
[00:52:18.803 --> 00:52:20.224]  He's the expert in this area.
[00:52:20.224 --> 00:52:22.085]  No, no, but I want to hear what you think they're going to do.
[00:52:22.932 --> 00:52:28.759]  They're going to do absolutely everything and kill any number of people or allow millions of people to die through this pandemic.
[00:52:28.759 --> 00:52:32.403]  Anything it takes for them to establish power because they have abandoned the rule of law.
[00:52:32.403 --> 00:52:33.044]  You just said it!
[00:52:33.044 --> 00:52:36.227]  There's no limit to what a psychotic criminal will do to our country.
[00:52:36.227 --> 00:52:39.712]  Look at Pelosi and Sanders already trying to make political hay.
[00:52:39.712 --> 00:52:41.634]  And Chris, even the senator from my former state.
[00:52:41.934 --> 00:52:48.335]  Chris Coons on TV talking about Trump's response to the coronavirus and all that, you know, criticizing and using it as a political issue.
[00:52:48.335 --> 00:52:57.677]  These are nothing these people, life or death, will not use in order to somehow consolidate, gather, grow, or expand their political power and their autocracy.
[00:52:57.677 --> 00:53:01.358]  And people should recognize them as criminal scum and reject them.
[00:53:01.358 --> 00:53:02.038]  We're just done.
[00:53:02.038 --> 00:53:03.098]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:53:03.098 --> 00:53:06.259]  Authority, they only exist in authority because we recognize it.
[00:53:06.619 --> 00:53:07.319]  We're good to go.
[00:53:25.228 --> 00:53:27.311]  The Republic against Communists?
[00:53:27.311 --> 00:53:28.673]  I back that statement.
[00:53:41.932 --> 00:53:47.796]  I mean, this, it's lawless, it's a-constitutional, it's almost post-constitutional the way they act.
[00:53:47.796 --> 00:54:06.629]  And, you know, with regard to the Stone thing, I mean, to challenge the pardon power, never in 220, 30 years of this republic has any credible scholar, legal or otherwise, said the pardon power is somehow limited or reviewable by the judiciary or, you know, limited by any act of Congress, much less one house.
[00:54:06.629 --> 00:54:10.092]  And they're attempting to say, just like the First Amendment doesn't exist, they're
[00:54:10.672 --> 00:54:11.473]  Or the second.
[00:54:11.473 --> 00:54:12.093]  No, it does.
[00:54:12.093 --> 00:54:13.054]  It's right there.
[00:54:13.054 --> 00:54:13.875]  That's what it's all about.
[00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:15.896]  We went to war with the British Empire for it.
[00:54:15.896 --> 00:54:17.298]  We have a right to have guns.
[00:54:17.298 --> 00:54:18.919]  Go to North Korea if you don't like it!
[00:54:23.258 --> 00:54:26.759]  It's about, I'm not a slave, and I have a right to defend myself.
[00:54:26.759 --> 00:54:30.660]  And it doesn't mean you have to take an AR-15 up against an F-15.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.240]  Give me a break.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.860]  It's a deterrent, okay?
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.101]  Oh, that swallows well.
[00:54:34.101 --> 00:54:38.042]  If you don't turn your guns in, we'll nuke you, showing how disconnected from reality he is.
[00:54:38.042 --> 00:54:39.682]  He doesn't even know what weapons are for.
[00:54:39.682 --> 00:54:41.563]  He doesn't know what weapons you use.
[00:54:41.563 --> 00:54:45.244]  You would lose the debate the day you use the nuke, dumbass.
[00:54:45.244 --> 00:54:48.744]  Plus, it destroys whole cities and infrastructures you don't use.
[00:54:48.744 --> 00:54:51.145]  We couldn't defeat Vietnam because we shouldn't be there.
[00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:53.849]  You can't defeat America.
[00:54:53.849 --> 00:54:56.191]  You think you can defeat America, you commies?
[00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:58.592]  As long as we can expose you as the enemy, you're done.
[00:54:58.592 --> 00:55:00.153]  Mike Adams?
[00:55:00.153 --> 00:55:06.278]  Well, this is the end of human civilization in the organized structure if we don't defend it, okay?
[00:55:06.278 --> 00:55:07.859]  This is the total collapse.
[00:55:07.859 --> 00:55:12.402]  These are just signs of collapse when you have a corrupt judge like this who simply abandons the rule of law.
[00:55:12.402 --> 00:55:15.964]  Yeah, there's an assault on civilization and the American capitalist
[00:55:16.204 --> 00:55:17.346]  Oh, we don't need that.
[00:55:17.346 --> 00:55:23.854]  Well, yeah, if we incrementally built towards self-individualism and ruggedness, we could build towards the point of almost no government.
[00:55:23.854 --> 00:55:30.122]  With the swab world we've got, we need a government of the people to defend against other governments.
[00:55:30.122 --> 00:55:31.283]  That's what libertarians never get.
[00:55:31.283 --> 00:55:33.366]  There's other governments coming at you!
[00:55:34.022 --> 00:55:36.703]  You've got to have an organization to defeat that, Mike.
[00:55:36.703 --> 00:55:50.090]  Well, and in a way, Roger Stone is now a historical figure of great importance because of his role in causing the deep state to expose their lawless and criminality at a level we've never seen before.
[00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:56.173]  Roger Stone has invoked the total frothing lawlessness and evil of the deep state.
[00:55:56.173 --> 00:55:57.074]  Exactly, Mike Adams.
[00:55:57.074 --> 00:55:58.174]  That's poetry right there.
[00:55:58.174 --> 00:55:59.475]  How did Roger Stone
[00:56:00.055 --> 00:56:05.039]  With the Infowars combination, some in the Leviathan, that is now destroying the Deep State.
[00:56:05.039 --> 00:56:07.140]  Why do they get so scared of Roger?
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.981]  He's so effective.
[00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:12.564]  He said it in Get Me Roger Stone, you know, they hate me because, you wouldn't hate me if I weren't effective.
[00:56:12.564 --> 00:56:17.187]  They don't, they come after the people, hardest, who are the most threat, of a threat to them.
[00:56:17.187 --> 00:56:18.848]  It shows them how they've come after you Alex.
[00:56:18.848 --> 00:56:24.432]  I mean, frankly, the lawsuits, you know, just the lawfare, the deplatforming, all of it.
[00:56:24.432 --> 00:56:27.314]  Hundreds of headlines a day, rigged search engines.
[00:56:27.714 --> 00:56:34.980]  Yeah, you're the biggest threat to them because you don't have any fear to speak out and speak the truth and speak it loudly and accurately as well.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.563]  You're not shading it, you're not giving it a spin or a veneer.
[00:56:38.563 --> 00:56:44.307]  And they live on the ability to manipulate not just words and facts and circumstances, but reality.
[00:56:44.307 --> 00:56:48.751]  I mean, it's like the whole thing, the whole left, it's gaslighting.
[00:56:48.751 --> 00:56:52.354]  They want you to believe that any reality they tell you is what we have to go with.
[00:56:52.354 --> 00:56:54.015]  I mean, I think this was found out at the
[00:56:54.614 --> 00:56:58.736]  The cancer that is the Clintons that came to this town 25, you know, 27 years ago.
[00:56:58.736 --> 00:57:00.537]  They would just murder everybody.
[00:57:00.537 --> 00:57:07.020]  Yeah, no, they brought this, like, uh... I think that's our greatest work, is standing and saying, go ahead and kill me, but I'm going to expose you.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.181]  That loses the fear.
[00:57:08.181 --> 00:57:09.541]  They don't get that anymore.
[00:57:09.541 --> 00:57:11.362]  You're like, you're going to murder me?
[00:57:11.362 --> 00:57:11.782]  Let's go.
[00:57:11.782 --> 00:57:12.823]  And before that was shame.
[00:57:12.823 --> 00:57:21.627]  You used to be able to shame people out of, you know, I mean, the establishment, if you were actually crooked, you know, there was sort of a consensus, well, nobody's going to defend this person, so they're on their own.
[00:57:21.627 --> 00:57:23.068]  Let's shame them for Sandy Hook.
[00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:25.591]  We're questioning big events.
[00:57:25.591 --> 00:57:26.532]  And none of it works.
[00:57:26.532 --> 00:57:27.152]  It's pathetic.
[00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:30.094]  I mean, all you did was exercise your First Amendment rights and raise questions.
[00:57:30.094 --> 00:57:31.274]  You didn't even make statements.
[00:57:31.274 --> 00:57:32.575]  All you did was ask questions.
[00:57:32.575 --> 00:57:34.296]  You can't even ask questions.
[00:57:34.296 --> 00:57:35.757]  So what do you expect them to do next?
[00:57:35.757 --> 00:57:39.359]  That's what I'm asking you and Mike Adams.
[00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:40.399]  Mike said just nothing.
[00:57:40.399 --> 00:57:41.199]  They'll do anything they can.
[00:57:41.199 --> 00:57:45.542]  We're going to come right back with Tyler Nixon and Mike Adams, and Mike Adams takes over.
[00:57:46.022 --> 00:57:48.084]  I'm going to go to CPAC with live feeds, MFORStore.com.
[00:57:48.084 --> 00:57:54.489]  Keith Banzimer powers the great line of high-quality, storable food we have available at ReadyHour and MFORStore.com.
[00:57:54.489 --> 00:57:56.250]  And yes, we're selling storable food here.
[00:57:56.250 --> 00:58:00.794]  What concerns me is we're a month into this and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[00:58:00.794 --> 00:58:02.095]  You've never seen anything like this.
[00:58:02.495 --> 00:58:05.038]  Never, never like this, and sustain.
[00:58:05.038 --> 00:58:10.203]  You know, it started, you know, 27 days ago, and it kind of went hyper, and it doesn't fall off.
[00:58:10.203 --> 00:58:13.706]  And in even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[00:58:13.706 --> 00:58:18.090]  The semis are rolling, the chips are in, we're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:22.374]  Orders that are getting in today, they're gonna ship, they're gonna just ship in 10 to 14 days.
[00:58:22.374 --> 00:58:23.896]  We're helping people prepare.
[00:58:24.096 --> 00:58:25.998]  It's just something you cover.
[00:58:25.998 --> 00:58:26.378]  Absolutely.
[00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:28.881]  You like to eat daily, and so we're just backing that up.
[00:58:28.881 --> 00:58:30.363]  It's the best insurance out there.
[00:58:30.363 --> 00:58:34.907]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[00:58:34.907 --> 00:58:38.531]  It's normal to sit on top of horrible food and guns.
[00:58:38.531 --> 00:58:39.632]  All our forebearers did it.
[00:58:39.632 --> 00:58:40.553]  We've got food.
[00:58:40.553 --> 00:58:41.594]  We've got guns.
[00:58:41.594 --> 00:58:42.555]  We've got Jesus.
[00:58:42.555 --> 00:58:43.456]  We know how to use it.
[00:58:43.456 --> 00:58:44.858]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[00:58:44.858 --> 00:58:45.799]  It's real simple.
[00:58:45.799 --> 00:58:46.760]  Noah prepared.
[00:58:49.386 --> 00:58:51.269]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[00:58:51.269 --> 00:58:53.093]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[00:58:53.093 --> 00:58:56.058]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs.
[00:58:56.058 --> 00:58:56.619]  Spiritually.
[00:58:56.619 --> 00:58:58.663]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[00:58:58.663 --> 00:59:00.205]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[00:59:01.846 --> 00:59:02.326]  in a fight
[00:59:31.926 --> 00:59:33.848]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:21.087 --> 01:00:33.357]  Well, I mean, let me tell you, it is amazing here in D.C.
[01:00:33.357 --> 01:00:36.560]  All these patriots here, and Nigel Farage is in town, and so much more.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.504]  You were hanging out with him last night, Tyler Nixon.
[01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:41.725]  Other comments about Roger?
[01:00:42.483 --> 01:00:49.270]  Yeah, I just think it's such a poetic justice that Roger Stone's case, given how badly they went after him and railroaded him or attempted to railroad him,
[01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:10.790]  Ultimately, and also the fact that he has, Roger is a libertarian, he calls himself a libertine.
[01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:14.733]  So, you know, you mentioned the fact of becoming hard after, you know, the libertarians where it's at.
[01:01:14.733 --> 01:01:20.398]  I mean, it's just, I think he represents, and as do you, sort of embodies everything that they hate.
[01:01:20.398 --> 01:01:26.463]  You know, it's about truth, it's about defiance of authority, illegitimate authority, it's about defending rights.
[01:01:26.463 --> 01:01:31.888]  These people, I mean, they are absolutely just autocratic, megalomaniacal, and totally unhinged now.
[01:01:32.469 --> 01:01:39.235]  I mean, there used to be sort of a nod-wink traditional establishment that had some credibility.
[01:01:39.235 --> 01:01:42.778]  It could do things and act on consensus.
[01:01:42.778 --> 01:01:44.780]  Now, it's just a flailing.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.580]  You know what it reminds me of?
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.622]  Remember the first movie, Aliens?
[01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:50.685]  They had that sort of cyborg guy who's kind of a defeat British.
[01:01:50.685 --> 01:01:53.527]  And then eventually his head pulls off and he's like laying in this...
[01:01:54.788 --> 01:02:08.736]  This thing of milk and it's like, you know, trying to talk and it's that, that's, I mean, when that alien, uh, that, uh, cyber goes berserk, that, that I think is what we're seeing right now in the sort of status left in America where they- That is the best analogy ever.
[01:02:08.736 --> 01:02:10.397]  They're just totally pre-programmed.
[01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:11.557]  They can't help it.
[01:02:11.557 --> 01:02:12.938]  And they're carrying out mission.
[01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.499]  He's like- Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:02:14.499 --> 01:02:15.519]  Literally.
[01:02:15.519 --> 01:02:17.381]  They're like flamethrowing him.
[01:02:17.381 --> 01:02:18.381]  You know what I'm talking about.
[01:02:18.381 --> 01:02:21.663]  Yeah, they have, they're like- And, and, and, and, you know-
[01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:24.977]  Roger, there were dark days throughout the last year.
[01:02:24.977 --> 01:02:27.259]  I had fun to do that.
[01:02:27.259 --> 01:02:29.981]  Sorry, I left us.
[01:02:29.981 --> 01:02:30.682]  There were dark days.
[01:02:30.682 --> 01:02:33.825]  With my Bernie Sanders pampers on.
[01:02:33.825 --> 01:02:38.549]  Huge, giant, fat women wanting Bernie Sanders, who says they should stand in food lines.
[01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:39.590]  I'm like, go to Venezuela!
[01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:41.952]  It's called the Venezuelan Starvation Diet.
[01:02:41.952 --> 01:02:43.233]  They're like, F you!
[01:02:43.233 --> 01:02:44.434]  Sorry.
[01:02:44.434 --> 01:02:45.514]  No, no, no, that's great.
[01:02:45.514 --> 01:02:45.955]  I saw that.
[01:02:45.955 --> 01:02:46.255]  What was it?
[01:02:46.255 --> 01:02:47.176]  When that woman mooned you?
[01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:53.816]  The walrus ass, exactly.
[01:02:53.816 --> 01:02:55.157]  Yeah, what is wrong with these people?
[01:02:55.157 --> 01:03:02.322]  I'm like, listen, it's okay you're a big ass fat ass, but just... You're fat in America and I guarantee you don't work a day in your life.
[01:03:02.322 --> 01:03:04.003]  Go to Venezuela!
[01:03:04.003 --> 01:03:05.124]  Starve to death!
[01:03:05.124 --> 01:03:05.784]  They don't even listen.
[01:03:05.784 --> 01:03:07.806]  Like, hey, communism's horrible.
[01:03:07.806 --> 01:03:09.227]  I'll kill you.
[01:03:09.227 --> 01:03:09.987]  I want everything.
[01:03:11.838 --> 01:03:13.859]  No, please go on, brother.
[01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:22.305]  For those not familiar, look up the Manson family and look at the footage of squeaky from and friend Winkle and all, whoever they look just like.
[01:03:22.305 --> 01:03:24.046]  This is what you're learning, right?
[01:03:24.046 --> 01:03:27.548]  The eyes, the sort of vacant sort of crazed looking eyes.
[01:03:28.092 --> 01:03:28.432]  I don't know.
[01:03:51.474 --> 01:03:54.615]  We might not be in the best club here.
[01:03:54.615 --> 01:03:57.755]  Mike Adams, what the hell is going to happen to this country?
[01:03:57.755 --> 01:04:01.496]  I'm not done laughing at that entire bit that I just heard there.
[01:04:01.496 --> 01:04:04.157]  That was, these people are lunatics.
[01:04:04.157 --> 01:04:09.678]  It's a massive mental insane asylum that the left is running now, and they think they understand economics.
[01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:10.258]  They don't.
[01:04:10.258 --> 01:04:11.618]  They think they understand the rule of law.
[01:04:11.618 --> 01:04:12.159]  They don't.
[01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:13.759]  They think they understand biology.
[01:04:13.759 --> 01:04:15.619]  They don't even think it's real, actually.
[01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.900]  You know, this whole non-biological thing.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.901]  We're going to legalize pedophilia in California.
[01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:24.222]  They've legalized giving people HIV.
[01:04:24.222 --> 01:04:26.883]  They're just assaulting reality.
[01:04:26.883 --> 01:04:32.384]  And wait until the virus invades the feces, filth-ridden city of San Francisco.
[01:04:32.384 --> 01:04:32.845]  Okay?
[01:04:32.845 --> 01:04:34.045]  You want a dose of reality?
[01:04:34.045 --> 01:04:36.706]  Wait until that day comes, because it's not far off.
[01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.247]  Mike, you're taking over here, but I want to do five more minutes.
[01:04:39.247 --> 01:04:43.068]  I want to get Tyler Nixon's take on the virus, and yours on this key point.
[01:04:43.068 --> 01:04:44.768]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:44.768 --> 01:04:45.729]  I'll be gone in five minutes.
[01:04:45.729 --> 01:04:46.609]  You can hear Mike talk.
[01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.851]  Because I know he's the expert on this.

[01:05:08.749 --> 01:05:12.893]  But we do still have it in the three ounce and the one ounce for a limited time.
[01:05:12.893 --> 01:05:21.462]  The good news is we have the Super Blue toothpaste and the Super Silver toothpaste, both that have the nano silver in them as well.
[01:05:21.462 --> 01:05:26.928]  The Super Blue has tea tree that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine.
[01:05:27.228 --> 01:05:34.630]  And then of course the whitening has the nano silver, but on top of that it has the above sea coral calcium that re-minimalizes the teeth.
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.870]  And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:37.811]  Period.
[01:05:37.811 --> 01:05:42.992]  It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it, though it'll sell out at current rates in about two weeks.
[01:05:42.992 --> 01:05:49.873]  But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so everybody can protect themselves with this high quality product.

[01:05:58.443 --> 01:06:03.424]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:03.424 --> 01:06:08.745]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:08.745 --> 01:06:10.566]  Well, I gotta tell you, I'm here in D.C.
[01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.746]  and about to go over to Maryland.
[01:06:11.746 --> 01:06:14.027]  I'm like a dog in a butcher shop from all the interviews.
[01:06:14.027 --> 01:06:15.527]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:15.527 --> 01:06:19.488]  Admiral Farrar, Secretary Carlson, I mean, it's all, the planet's aligning here.
[01:06:19.488 --> 01:06:23.889]  We have Roger Stone's personal lawyer here who's not afraid of the judge, he's not getting
[01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:29.792]  The case from the lawyer perspective, which is a citizen, and he's been here, how this has blown up their face.
[01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:39.236]  I cannot hype enough how this is Amy Bergman Jackson has just screwed the poacher and totally been caught with her ass hanging out at high noon.
[01:06:39.236 --> 01:06:40.997]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:52.642]  But I wanted to, just before Mike Adams has a special doctor coming on on coronavirus in just a moment, get your view, Tyler Nixon, on coronavirus, just as an army officer and a lawyer and
[01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.005]  Roger Stone's lawyer, just a patriot.
[01:06:56.005 --> 01:06:58.787]  What's your gut level approximation?
[01:06:58.787 --> 01:07:07.432]  It's, I mean, the way we've just found, uh, Northern California announced the first unsourced or quote, community infection where they can't source where it came from.
[01:07:07.432 --> 01:07:10.113]  There's no, the person had no contact with anybody.
[01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:13.715]  It almost seems like it's being spread versus it's spreading itself.
[01:07:13.715 --> 01:07:21.680]  You know, someone's, this is being introduced in areas and you know, also the two week timeframe for the manifestation of any symptoms.
[01:07:22.498 --> 01:07:27.241]  That really lends itself like it's been engineered to spread itself before people can detect it.
[01:07:27.241 --> 01:07:34.285]  And I just think it's a bioweapon being used by who knows what parties, but clearly not for good.
[01:07:34.285 --> 01:07:35.265]  And that's why there's fear.
[01:07:35.265 --> 01:07:37.587]  People know it's a bioweapon.
[01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:46.932]  Fortunately, the mortality rates are still nothing akin to, like, say, the flu pandemic, influenza pandemic.
[01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:49.073]  Except, exactly, this reinfects, though.
[01:07:49.073 --> 01:07:50.354]  That's the weird wild card.
[01:07:50.354 --> 01:07:50.454]  Yeah.
[01:07:50.999 --> 01:07:55.861]  No it's uh it's really just the fact that people there are people on this planet.
[01:07:55.861 --> 01:07:57.922]  Wouldn't that be the ultimate bio weapon?
[01:07:57.922 --> 01:08:00.042]  That you don't ever beat it?
[01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:09.626]  Yeah well they have I mean you think about they have uh I mean like herpes simplex you know like these persistent viruses that maintain like they're just cause like
[01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:14.500]  Well, you know what, we could talk about evil all day.
[01:08:40.329 --> 01:08:50.416]  Look in the mirror, and I say this to myself, we need to get control of our governments and prosecute and persecute people that are developing bioweapons, Mike Adams, don't we?
[01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:50.876]  We do.
[01:08:50.876 --> 01:09:04.145]  And by the way, if the same number of people were infected in America with the coronavirus, as are typically infected with the flu, we would have probably 3.5 million deaths in America, not just the 35,000 that are killed by the flu.
[01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:09.189]  So the only reason the flu has killed more people so far is because the coronavirus spread has only just begun.
[01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:14.352]  It hasn't even infected 1% of the world population yet.
[01:09:14.352 --> 01:09:16.194]  And we already have all of these deaths.
[01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.214]  So this has just begun.
[01:09:17.214 --> 01:09:19.696]  And this is going to go on for years because it's going to keep coming back.
[01:09:19.696 --> 01:09:20.997]  The CDC has acknowledged it.
[01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:22.818]  All the virologists know that that's how it's working.
[01:09:22.818 --> 01:09:24.219]  And the mutations are happening.
[01:09:24.219 --> 01:09:26.861]  There was a mutation that was detected in Iran.
[01:09:26.861 --> 01:09:30.584]  So we're already getting second and probably third generation versions of this virus.
[01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:30.964]  Absolutely.
[01:09:30.964 --> 01:09:31.865]  You're about to take over.
[01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:33.046]  I want to just say this in closing.
[01:09:36.288 --> 01:09:36.388]  Yes.
[01:09:52.532 --> 01:09:53.092]  We're good to go.
[01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:22.771]  Yes.
[01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:41.178]  Rule on when he goes to jail.
[01:10:41.178 --> 01:10:42.099]  Why is she waiting?
[01:10:42.099 --> 01:10:43.499]  What do you think Trump's going to do?
[01:10:43.499 --> 01:10:45.579]  Just a few final comments on where you think this is going.
[01:10:45.579 --> 01:10:47.080]  Well, I'll tell you, it's taken such a twist.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:47.560]  I don't know.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.681]  I can't predict, but I think the president will pardon Roger Stone, and he has to.
[01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:55.262]  I do not believe this judge will grant a new trial.
[01:10:55.262 --> 01:10:57.402]  She would never admit to any of this.
[01:10:57.402 --> 01:10:59.883]  She's an arrogant piece of crap that must be checkmated.
[01:11:00.584 --> 01:11:04.887]  She will never admit to having done anything that was offline.
[01:11:04.887 --> 01:11:06.669]  And they're telling Trump he doesn't have this power.
[01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:08.430]  He's got to exercise it.
[01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.111]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:11:09.111 --> 01:11:17.417]  She better hope that she doesn't think to listen to, frankly, these claims that she wouldn't have to accept a part of because he's been.
[01:11:18.594 --> 01:11:20.074]  And was exonerated, by the way.
[01:11:20.074 --> 01:11:22.115]  They're trying to make her the president.
[01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:24.055]  They're trying to make her the president.
[01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:28.436]  Because if she can checkmate a pardon, she's now the executive.
[01:11:28.436 --> 01:11:32.877]  Just as they want the House of Representatives alone to be able to eliminate the pardon power.
[01:11:32.877 --> 01:11:40.239]  If that was the case, the House of Representatives and an opposing party could meet at the beginning of a president's term, impeach them for anything they say they want to, and that would be it.
[01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:41.439]  The pardon power goes away.
[01:11:41.439 --> 01:11:42.359]  That's the argument they're making.
[01:11:42.359 --> 01:11:44.280]  They would guild them.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.140]  Yeah, basically.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:45.500]  Exactly.
[01:11:46.323 --> 01:11:48.807]  So the President is elected, we chop his balls off.
[01:11:48.807 --> 01:11:50.549]  Just the House, not even the full Congress.
[01:11:50.549 --> 01:11:54.835]  I mean, where's the... That's martial law.
[01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:59.262]  That's authoritarian dictatorship of the Democrat House and Schiff.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.384]  The tyranny now of the majority, but formerly minority.
[01:12:04.384 --> 01:12:12.212]  I think the minority, when you look at average citizens, do not want this type of autocracy running the world for us.
[01:12:12.212 --> 01:12:17.698]  We are here, not even having to dial this up or exaggerate, it's so classically evil.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.382]  So over the top.
[01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:21.963]  It's like unspeakable.
[01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:29.030]  We cannot say how bad it is because it's so ridiculous and it runs totally against everything America is.
[01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:31.232]  It's just fantastic.
[01:12:31.232 --> 01:12:32.453]  It's fantabulous.
[01:12:32.453 --> 01:12:34.995]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:12:34.995 --> 01:12:36.657]  It's a spectacle of just
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:53.055]  Yeah, it's the manifestation of their delusions, basically, but, you know, imperfectly so.
[01:12:53.055 --> 01:12:55.858]  I mean, they want us to live in this reality that's not a reality.
[01:12:55.858 --> 01:12:57.260]  It's their fantasy, it's their delusion.
[01:12:57.987 --> 01:12:59.228]  And they never give up.
[01:12:59.228 --> 01:13:02.370]  Mike Adams take over, but they just keep dialing it up.
[01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.112]  Hey, Tyler Nixon will be on with us tomorrow.
[01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:05.433]  We're going to CPAC right now together.
[01:13:05.433 --> 01:13:06.633]  Great job, Tyler Nixon.
[01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:08.635]  How do people find you on the internet?
[01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:11.197]  Go to Twitter at TylerPNixon.com.
[01:13:11.197 --> 01:13:13.438]  Great place to follow up, Tyler P. Nixon.
[01:13:13.438 --> 01:13:17.041]  Mike Adams, take over with your guest, but I'll ask this question in closing.
[01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:18.822]  You said it earlier, it's unlimited.
[01:13:18.822 --> 01:13:19.683]  There's nothing they won't do.
[01:13:20.933 --> 01:13:22.093]  There's nothing they won't do.
[01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:27.955]  There's no amount of life that they are not willing to sacrifice in order to achieve their goals.
[01:13:27.955 --> 01:13:31.896]  But look, thank you, Alex, and thank you, Tyler Nixon, especially for those comments.
[01:13:31.896 --> 01:13:45.439]  We are shortly going to be joined by Dr. Thomas Levy, who is an orthomolecular medicine expert and a clinician, a cardiologist who has a lot of expertise in using intravenous vitamin C therapy to eliminate toxins.
[01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:56.428]  From the blood supply, in essence, inducing the body to eliminate toxins through its own processes, such as kidney removal of those toxins, liver detoxification, and so on.
[01:13:56.428 --> 01:13:57.829]  So, why is this relevant?
[01:13:57.829 --> 01:14:07.557]  Because right now, the world has no approved drugs for the coronavirus, no approved vaccine, not even one in any clinical trial.
[01:14:07.557 --> 01:14:09.759]  Not that that would even work, who knows?
[01:14:10.359 --> 01:14:14.782]  But there are natural approaches to solving this problem.
[01:14:14.782 --> 01:14:22.266]  And in fact, intravenous vitamin C has had many reports of early success in hospitals around China, as well as Korea.
[01:14:22.266 --> 01:14:25.968]  I know it's being experimented with in places like Hong Kong and others.
[01:14:25.968 --> 01:14:29.750]  So we're going to be joined by Dr. Thomas Levy shortly.
[01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:34.253]  In fact, at the top of the next break, or the next segment, excuse me.
[01:14:34.253 --> 01:14:39.036]  But I want Dr. Levy's take on something that I'm about to explain here in 60 seconds.
[01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:48.883]  The current flowchart of CDC's guidance for testing is found in a new article posted by Kit Daniels on Infowars.com.
[01:14:48.883 --> 01:14:53.106]  CDC faces scrutiny over limited coronavirus testing.
[01:14:53.106 --> 01:14:55.528]  I have been hammering this point for days.
[01:14:55.528 --> 01:15:05.655]  The testing protocol from the CDC prohibits the testing of individuals in America who have acquired this infection from unknown origins, i.e.
[01:15:05.655 --> 01:15:05.836]  other
[01:15:06.596 --> 01:15:12.541]  Asymptomatic individuals who are carrying the virus and spreading it during the incubation period.
[01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:15.603]  Notice, you will be tested if you travel to China.
[01:15:15.603 --> 01:15:21.187]  You will be tested if you've had close contact with a person known to have the illness, but that's it.
[01:15:21.187 --> 01:15:30.474]  If you did not travel to China, and you did not acquire it from someone who's known to have it, you will not be tested in the United States, except in very rare circumstances.
[01:15:30.474 --> 01:15:35.037]  And to date, only 445 Americans have been tested by the CDC.
[01:15:35.037 --> 01:15:35.418]  That's it.
[01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:41.041]  How can you monitor community outbreaks if you're not even testing for them?
[01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:46.904]  We're going to get Dr. Levy's take on that plus intravenous vitamin C therapy when we return after this short break.
[01:15:46.904 --> 01:15:49.225]  This is Infowars.com, Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:49.225 --> 01:15:50.285]  Mike Adams sitting in today.
[01:15:50.285 --> 01:15:51.006]  Stay with us.
[01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:53.127]  We'll be right back with Dr. Levy and much more.
[01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:59.211]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[01:15:59.211 --> 01:16:02.133]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[01:16:02.133 --> 01:16:09.357]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:14.581]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[01:16:55.672 --> 01:16:59.115]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:03.979]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[01:17:03.979 --> 01:17:10.384]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[01:17:10.384 --> 01:17:15.849]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[01:17:15.849 --> 01:17:18.291]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.732]  Oh, can I ever?
[01:17:19.732 --> 01:17:21.594]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[01:17:24.876 --> 01:17:25.617]  Guess what?
[01:17:25.617 --> 01:17:30.680]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:40.947]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[01:17:57.258 --> 01:18:02.783]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[01:18:02.783 --> 01:18:06.206]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[01:18:06.206 --> 01:18:06.767]  Yeah.
[01:18:06.767 --> 01:18:09.349]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man, I love women.
[01:18:09.349 --> 01:18:10.951]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[01:18:10.951 --> 01:18:12.332]  You may have problems with her.
[01:18:12.332 --> 01:18:13.613]  You may get a divorce.
[01:18:13.613 --> 01:18:14.234]  You may whatever.
[01:18:14.234 --> 01:18:18.958]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful when I left.
[01:18:19.238 --> 01:18:33.173]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storable foods, we've got the best out there because I want you to get a great result and to come back again and again as a customer and fund our political, spiritual operations against globalism.
[01:18:33.173 --> 01:18:38.039]  So if you want storable foods and everybody else is sold out and you want them delivered to your door, you want them to be high quality,
[01:18:38.559 --> 01:18:39.920]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.863]  Coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon designed to destroy nation-states, economies,
[01:19:06.049 --> 01:19:06.830]  We're good to go.
[01:19:32.112 --> 01:19:35.294]  That's how major this is.
[01:19:35.294 --> 01:19:37.015]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[01:19:37.015 --> 01:19:40.738]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[01:19:40.738 --> 01:19:49.983]  InfoWars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[01:19:49.983 --> 01:19:55.607]  We need you to step up to the plate and help spread the word about Band-Odd Video and InfoWars.com today.
[01:19:59.893 --> 01:20:13.085]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.085 --> 01:20:19.792]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:19.792 --> 01:20:22.094]  It's Mike Adams.
[01:20:22.094 --> 01:20:24.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.443 --> 01:20:29.825]  Mike Adams here, publisher of naturalnews.com.
[01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:30.665]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:20:30.665 --> 01:20:34.988]  Hosting right now for Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[01:20:34.988 --> 01:20:44.395]  And we have a very special guest for this segment, very important person with a body of knowledge that may help save literally millions of lives across the planet.
[01:20:44.395 --> 01:20:46.296]  His name is Dr. Thomas Levy.
[01:20:46.296 --> 01:20:50.439]  This is the first time I'm meeting him and I'm honored to have him on.
[01:20:50.439 --> 01:20:53.141]  And he's a specialist in orthomolecular medicine.
[01:20:53.141 --> 01:20:56.022]  He's a cardiologist and he understands the role of intravenous vitamin C.
[01:20:56.963 --> 01:21:00.605]  In treating a number of chronic degenerative health conditions.
[01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:03.326]  He has clinical experience in these areas.
[01:21:03.326 --> 01:21:10.929]  And while the world waits for a vaccine that may not ever work or may not ever appear, we have many answers that exist right now, this very minute.
[01:21:10.929 --> 01:21:13.330]  So let's welcome Dr. Levy to the show.
[01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:14.330]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:16.772]  It's a pleasure to have you on.
[01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:17.652]  My pleasure, Mike.
[01:21:17.652 --> 01:21:19.913]  It's a great opportunity to talk to the Health Ranger.
[01:21:20.905 --> 01:21:26.950]  Well, look, I'm an admirer of your work and what you do, your body of knowledge.
[01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:30.313]  Give us the big top-down view first.
[01:21:30.313 --> 01:21:33.115]  What is intravenous vitamin C therapy?
[01:21:33.115 --> 01:21:39.960]  What is it being used for right now and how might it have application in this particular global context?
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.841]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:21:40.841 --> 01:21:50.029]  Although much of mainstream medicine still doesn't seem to appreciate this, vitamin C is not some sort of cult-type application.
[01:21:50.029 --> 01:21:50.449]  It has a
[01:21:51.013 --> 01:22:09.468]  Huge body of scientific data going back to the 1940s, in which case when you give large enough amounts of vitamin C intravenously, you're capable of resolving a great deal of different, especially viral syndromes, other types of infections as well.
[01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:14.812]  But for some reason, vitamin C is especially potent for viruses.
[01:22:14.812 --> 01:22:16.193]  This is significant because
[01:22:17.375 --> 01:22:21.438]  I also want to make the point, I'm not saying vitamin C is going to cure everything.
[01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:33.628]  I'm not making crazy accusations, but it is a fact, and it's supported in the scientific data, that vitamin C is probably the primary ammunition for your immune system.
[01:22:33.628 --> 01:22:40.233]  All the immune cells have far and away the highest concentrations of vitamin C of any cells in the body.
[01:22:40.233 --> 01:22:41.233]  And this is really why
[01:22:42.577 --> 01:22:48.381]  A functioning immune system is so effective because it gets vitamin C where it needs to go.
[01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:59.768]  When your immune system is depleted, and you don't have much vitamin C in them, then you're subject to a lot of problems with infections, with diseases.
[01:22:59.768 --> 01:23:03.930]  But intravenous vitamin C gets you a large amount of vitamin C where you need it quickly.
[01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:09.914]  It specifically, in the literature, strengthens the immune system by at least 19 different mechanisms.
[01:23:10.794 --> 01:23:17.658]  It increases T-cells, B-cells, antibody production, natural killer cells, interferon.
[01:23:17.658 --> 01:23:19.239]  The list goes on and on.
[01:23:19.239 --> 01:23:21.041]  And this is not just hearsay.
[01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:26.124]  This is solid, peer-reviewed research in the scientific literature on PubMed.
[01:23:26.124 --> 01:23:37.911]  So, interestingly enough, with the problems going on in China, it turns out China is one of the world leaders in vitamin C research, particularly IV vitamin C. Way back in the 70s.
[01:23:38.939 --> 01:23:39.359]  Go ahead.
[01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:40.360]  Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Levy.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:44.202]  Let me ask some questions that I think some viewers might be asking right up front.
[01:23:44.202 --> 01:23:52.706]  So, number one, what advantage does intravenous have over oral supplementation of vitamin C?
[01:23:52.706 --> 01:23:57.508]  Are people not able to absorb it or you can't get the concentration high enough in the blood through oral application?
[01:23:57.508 --> 01:24:00.450]  What's the explanation there?
[01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:01.310]  That's exactly it.
[01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:03.291]  It's limited absorption.
[01:24:03.291 --> 01:24:08.554]  Let me say this, long before and even when intravenous vitamin C is not available,
[01:24:09.332 --> 01:24:19.319]  Many people have gotten incredibly positive results with different diseases but also infections when they're persistent in taking oral dosing throughout the day.
[01:24:19.319 --> 01:24:24.663]  There's also specialty forms of vitamin C if you will, liposome encapsulated.
[01:24:24.663 --> 01:24:34.911]  These are highly effective too and can have a profound impact on arming the cells with vitamin C because they deliver vitamin C directly inside the cells of the body.
[01:24:35.387 --> 01:24:41.370]  But yes, it's all a matter, I used to say, what's the three most important things in vitamin C therapy?
[01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:44.812]  Well, like real estate, it's location, location, location.
[01:24:44.812 --> 01:24:47.754]  With vitamin C, it's dose, dose, and dose.
[01:24:47.754 --> 01:24:57.039]  So are you trying to, with intravenous, I'm just curious, are you aiming for a target concentration in the blood, a certain number of micrograms per deciliter or something like that?
[01:24:57.039 --> 01:25:02.622]  Do you calculate the volume of blood based on a person's weight and then apply the dose that way?
[01:25:02.622 --> 01:25:03.142]  I'm just curious.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:18.454]  You can do it that way, but myself and many other vitamin C advocates and users have been using vitamin C for so long, we pretty much know what 25,000 milligrams, 50,000 milligrams, even 100,000 milligrams is going to give you in blood levels.
[01:25:21.713 --> 01:25:26.115]  And really, the primary thing you need to watch is clinical response.
[01:25:26.115 --> 01:25:31.217]  When vitamin C is working in an infection, it works very rapidly in terms of symptoms.
[01:25:31.217 --> 01:25:32.137]  So it's grams.
[01:25:32.137 --> 01:25:33.398]  Wow.
[01:25:33.398 --> 01:25:36.059]  I didn't realize it was that large.
[01:25:36.059 --> 01:25:39.240]  But, you know, people need to be aware, too, vitamin C is water-soluble.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.061]  Your body eliminates it quite quickly.
[01:25:41.061 --> 01:25:43.802]  How quickly does vitamin C actually come out of your body?
[01:25:43.802 --> 01:25:48.944]  You know, if you get the level you want in your blood, isn't that mostly gone in a few hours?
[01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:50.605]  Or, you know better than I, what's the answer there?
[01:25:51.547 --> 01:25:52.328]  No, that's correct.
[01:25:52.328 --> 01:26:05.917]  If you give a 50 gram infusion of vitamin C, most of it will be gone four to five hours down the road, but you'll have gotten a temporary very high concentration that allows it to penetrate the cells very effectively.
[01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:17.565]  So, the other thing too is we're now starting to see, and they're doing a study in China where they're giving coronavirus patients 24,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day intravenously,
[01:26:18.151 --> 01:26:22.892]  But they're not giving it as a quick bolus, they're giving it as a slow 7-hour infusion.
[01:26:22.892 --> 01:26:27.893]  And I think this will have an even superior effect to giving a quick IV bolus.
[01:26:27.893 --> 01:26:34.534]  Wouldn't that also, then, you have all these other positive side effects from it as well, not side effects, but benefits.
[01:26:34.534 --> 01:26:38.575]  You would have cardiovascular benefits from such treatment as well.
[01:26:38.575 --> 01:26:43.016]  There's an enormous body of evidence in that arena, isn't there?
[01:26:43.016 --> 01:26:47.217]  Yes, the thing is, all disease is oxidative stress.
[01:26:47.884 --> 01:26:50.765]  And how many biomolecules you have oxidized.
[01:26:50.765 --> 01:26:56.266]  The only way you get those biomolecules to function again is to donate electrons.
[01:26:56.266 --> 01:27:03.247]  And although there were many antioxidants, vitamin C is the premier electron donating antioxidant.
[01:27:03.247 --> 01:27:05.587]  It gives two electrons per molecule.
[01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:13.389]  And this is why even though any antioxidant can resolve an oxidized biomolecule, which is the essence of disease,
[01:27:14.249 --> 01:27:16.431]  Vitamin C spearheads this.
[01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:22.435]  It's a small molecule, just like glucose, gets everywhere in the body, gets across the blood-brain barrier.
[01:27:22.435 --> 01:27:32.843]  So the more you can keep your natural biomolecules in the reduced state, the more you will retain normal function and avoid or help resolve disease.
[01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:38.314]  And I would imagine, this is great by the way, amazing information.
[01:27:38.314 --> 01:27:53.679]  Be sure to let our readers, our listeners know where they can find more information about you, but I would imagine this is especially useful for the elderly who tend to have a poor assimilation, poor digestion, and that's the exact group that tends to be more aggressively hit by this virus.
[01:27:53.679 --> 01:27:59.561]  So if anybody's lives might be potentially saved by this as we conduct more research, wouldn't it be the elderly?
[01:28:01.038 --> 01:28:06.481]  Well, as you know, we live in a very toxin-filled society and all toxins are pro-oxidant.
[01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:13.664]  All toxins cause their damage by oxidizing or causing biomolecules to be oxidized.
[01:28:13.664 --> 01:28:21.488]  So, the older you are, the more toxins you face, the more toxins you have in your body, the more depleted your immune system is.
[01:28:21.488 --> 01:28:26.390]  And so, yes, it has an especially dramatic effect in the older folks.
[01:28:27.113 --> 01:28:46.062]  I want to say something that might seem a little off subject, but with regard to the coronavirus epidemic, there now exists a good body of evidence to show that doing simple measures like nebulizing, putting something like hydrogen peroxide 3% into a fine mist and inhaling it... Dr. Levy, hold that thought.
[01:28:46.062 --> 01:28:47.603]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:28:47.603 --> 01:28:51.345]  We're going to break in just a few seconds, but please continue on the other side.
[01:28:51.345 --> 01:28:52.505]  This is fascinating.
[01:28:52.505 --> 01:28:53.406]  We're back with Dr. Levy.
[01:28:56.021 --> 01:28:57.221]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.221 --> 01:29:01.143]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.143 --> 01:29:02.703]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.703 --> 01:29:05.644]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:11.206]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.206 --> 01:29:12.406]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.406 --> 01:29:15.347]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.347 --> 01:29:17.568]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.568 --> 01:29:22.009]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.009 --> 01:29:24.310]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.879 --> 01:29:27.140]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:28.420]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:32.162]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:32.162 --> 01:29:33.243]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:35.084]  You're not a live-underground gopher.
[01:29:35.084 --> 01:29:36.784]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:29:36.784 --> 01:29:44.568]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:44.568 --> 01:29:45.589]  Bold statement?
[01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:46.589]  You bet.
[01:29:46.589 --> 01:29:49.070]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:51.271]  That's survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:51.271 --> 01:29:54.433]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:57.149 --> 01:30:02.469]  A lot of people ask me the InfoWars secret, and I'll just tell you, I'm just real.
[01:30:03.618 --> 01:30:08.460]  Now, the problem is, I go back and forth, though, in my mind about where I stand.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:12.362]  I mean, on basic stuff, like the Second Amendment, family, and God, I'm 100%.
[01:30:12.362 --> 01:30:16.263]  But you get to other issues, I start asking myself questions.
[01:30:16.263 --> 01:30:22.085]  So I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty during the middle of this crisis selling high-quality, storable food.
[01:30:22.085 --> 01:30:30.669]  Even though I was pre-positioned, I'm right, we were right about being man-made, we're right about it being super deadly, we're right about being prepared, it still feels weird to be right.
[01:30:31.414 --> 01:30:32.734]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:30:32.734 --> 01:30:33.495]  But you know what?
[01:30:33.495 --> 01:30:34.895]  I'm getting past that.
[01:30:34.895 --> 01:30:36.516]  We still have swearable food.
[01:30:36.516 --> 01:30:37.376]  We have plenty of it.
[01:30:37.376 --> 01:30:39.897]  The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out.
[01:30:39.897 --> 01:30:41.257]  Other competitors don't have it.
[01:30:41.257 --> 01:30:42.058]  They're lying to you.
[01:30:42.058 --> 01:30:47.300]  Get your orders at infowarrestore.com and you know you're going to get high quality, swearable food.
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.960]  But now it's not two weeks.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:49.961]  It's four weeks, folks.
[01:30:49.961 --> 01:30:50.681]  We got the food.
[01:30:50.681 --> 01:30:51.861]  We got to package it.
[01:30:51.861 --> 01:30:57.103]  Get your food today, high quality, and fund the InfoWar at infowarrestore.com.
[01:30:57.103 --> 01:30:58.824]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[01:30:59.844 --> 01:31:03.828]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[01:31:03.828 --> 01:31:05.150]  It's very communicable.
[01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:07.152]  It spreads very, very fast.
[01:31:07.152 --> 01:31:09.134]  It is killing a lot of people.
[01:31:09.134 --> 01:31:12.858]  And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:15.801]  And the White House is now openly challenging them.
[01:31:15.801 --> 01:31:18.884]  So are Trump's top scientists, and so is Senator Cotton.
[01:31:19.676 --> 01:31:24.319]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[01:31:24.319 --> 01:31:26.661]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[01:31:26.661 --> 01:31:30.404]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[01:31:30.404 --> 01:31:33.306]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[01:31:33.306 --> 01:31:36.729]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared.
[01:31:36.729 --> 01:31:39.811]  And InfoWarsStore.com has the products.
[01:31:40.131 --> 01:31:41.052]  Real stuff, man.
[01:31:41.052 --> 01:31:43.193]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[01:31:43.193 --> 01:31:47.936]  And I love Trump all day long, but, man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:08.091]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:32:08.091 --> 01:32:09.793]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:13.596]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[01:32:13.596 --> 01:32:17.439]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[01:32:17.439 --> 01:32:18.680]  20 different stickers.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.302]  Impeach the Democrats.
[01:32:20.302 --> 01:32:21.383]  Save the Second Amendment.
[01:32:21.383 --> 01:32:22.463]  Defend the First Amendment.
[01:32:22.463 --> 01:32:23.805]  Infowars.com.
[01:32:23.805 --> 01:32:25.966]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[01:32:25.966 --> 01:32:30.750]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:32.332]  People say, why are you doing this?
[01:32:32.332 --> 01:32:32.852]  What's happening?
[01:32:32.852 --> 01:32:34.333]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[01:32:34.974 --> 01:32:36.455]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[01:32:36.455 --> 01:32:39.837]  And Dr. Puccini, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[01:32:39.837 --> 01:32:40.778]  It's brilliant.
[01:32:40.778 --> 01:32:47.862]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:50.804]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[01:32:50.804 --> 01:32:53.646]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[01:32:53.646 --> 01:32:59.870]  Silence.
[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:02.512]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.911 --> 01:33:17.154]  You found it.
[01:33:17.154 --> 01:33:19.179]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:19.179 --> 01:33:23.731]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:31.605]  We're continuing a fascinating interview with Dr. Thomas Levy from peakenergy.com.
[01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:33.887]  He's an expert in intravenous vitamin C therapy.
[01:33:33.887 --> 01:33:43.075]  I just want to be clear to the regulators watching this show, we are in no way claiming that vitamin C cures coronavirus.
[01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:45.898]  We are in no way making, you know, medicinal claims.
[01:33:45.898 --> 01:33:47.540]  In fact, there's nothing in the world that's been tested.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.562]  Clinically, against coronavirus.
[01:33:50.562 --> 01:34:03.912]  However, there is an enormous body of knowledge about vitamin C and its ability to help the body heal, to detoxify, to reduce the oxidation states, as Dr. Levy was just describing.
[01:34:03.912 --> 01:34:10.236]  And shouldn't we consider all medicine when we come to saving lives?
[01:34:10.236 --> 01:34:13.359]  Why should we wait for the vaccine industry
[01:34:13.999 --> 01:34:21.604]  When there are other possible therapies right now that can be investigated and that may be able to help save millions of lives right now.
[01:34:21.604 --> 01:34:23.286]  And that's what we're talking about with Dr. Levy.
[01:34:23.286 --> 01:34:27.829]  So again, Dr. Thomas Levy from PeakEnergy.com.
[01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:30.731]  I apologize for interrupting you in the last segment there, Dr. Levy.
[01:34:30.731 --> 01:34:32.132]  Please, please continue.
[01:34:32.132 --> 01:34:34.974]  You were on to something really interesting.
[01:34:34.974 --> 01:34:36.895]  Well, I want to add to your point right there.
[01:34:36.895 --> 01:34:38.516]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:34:38.516 --> 01:34:42.059]  I don't want anybody to think I'm saying take vitamin C and you'll be cured.
[01:34:42.537 --> 01:34:48.961]  But I will say, take vitamin C and you will give an incredible increase in strength to your immune system.
[01:34:48.961 --> 01:34:54.124]  And isn't that what anybody wants if they're dealing with any type of infection?
[01:34:54.124 --> 01:35:04.290]  Now what I was mentioning earlier is, to the best of my knowledge, all viral syndromes, virtually all viral syndromes, come in through the portal of the nose and the mouth.
[01:35:04.290 --> 01:35:10.713]  And then they replicate to high titers on the mucous membranes of your nasopharynx and your oropharynx.
[01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:35.162]  It makes a great deal of sense, and I've already seen a great deal of positive response to other viruses, that when you're taking vitamin C and whatever else you want to strengthen your immune system to deal with the virus that's already in your body, causing your influenza, causing your coronavirus syndrome, it makes a lot of sense to cut the head off of the snake.
[01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:35.963]  By that I mean
[01:35:38.041 --> 01:35:41.845]  You can nebulize, which is inhaling a fine mist.
[01:35:41.845 --> 01:35:58.444]  When you take something simple like 3% hydrogen peroxide and inhale it, you can quickly knock down and virtually eliminate the large amount of virus that's replicating in your throat and eliminate the new seeding to the rest of the body.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.721]  I say it's like cutting the head off the snake.
[01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:03.524]  So it's always good to have a two-fold approach.
[01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:08.327]  Stop the new virus from coming in while eliminating their old virus.
[01:36:08.327 --> 01:36:18.555]  And for people that say hydrogen peroxide, well hydrogen peroxide is one of the most well-known and well-established and least toxic agents there is at the right concentration
[01:36:19.662 --> 01:36:23.264]  And it kills pathogens on contact of all variety.
[01:36:23.264 --> 01:36:27.346]  That's why you put it on an infected wound, and you get quick resolution of the wound.
[01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:31.428]  So you could use something as simple as an essential oil diffuser.
[01:36:31.428 --> 01:36:33.890]  You put in a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide.
[01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:35.010]  You mentioned 3%.
[01:36:35.010 --> 01:36:36.211]  Obviously, people need to be careful.
[01:36:36.211 --> 01:36:40.473]  If it's too high, you could, you know, cause some oxidation damage of your skin, right?
[01:36:40.473 --> 01:36:43.375]  So keep it low, and you could inhale that.
[01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:44.175]  That's what you're describing.
[01:36:44.175 --> 01:36:45.056]  It's that simple, right?
[01:36:46.118 --> 01:36:49.099]  Absolutely, but I'd be careful with the oil-based substances.
[01:36:49.099 --> 01:36:50.520]  Those are a different ball of wax.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.801]  The hydrogen peroxide quickly does its job and goes away.
[01:36:53.801 --> 01:36:59.363]  Right now, we're just talking about hydrogen peroxide basically with water is typically what's sold.
[01:36:59.363 --> 01:37:08.066]  Yeah, you wouldn't want to inhale volatile organic oils from plants, but it's nice to have that scent perhaps.
[01:37:08.066 --> 01:37:09.467]  It might be very pleasing.
[01:37:09.807 --> 01:37:12.108]  Okay, so another technical question for you.
[01:37:12.108 --> 01:37:14.369]  So, is it ascorbic acid?
[01:37:14.369 --> 01:37:20.972]  Is that the form that you're putting in intravenously, or is it a slightly different form of the molecule?
[01:37:20.972 --> 01:37:25.833]  Well, the essence is ascorbate, which is the anion.
[01:37:25.833 --> 01:37:29.095]  Hydrogen is a cation, so that's ascorbic acid.
[01:37:29.095 --> 01:37:31.936]  Then you have sodium as a cation, sodium ascorbate.
[01:37:32.526 --> 01:37:47.318]  Sodium ascorbate is probably the best to use because it comes in, in solution, closest to a very non-aggravating and well-tolerated pH of 7, 7.1, 7.2, with 7.4 being ideal.
[01:37:47.318 --> 01:37:53.463]  Ascorbic acid in solution always has to be further buffered to make the acid part less alkaline.
[01:37:53.792 --> 01:38:00.925]  And is sodium the buffer that you typically use in your formulations, or are you using a different mineral choice?
[01:38:00.925 --> 01:38:05.913]  My favorite, and it's based on my experience and on the literature, is sodium ascorbate, yes.
[01:38:06.618 --> 01:38:08.679]  All right, that's great.
[01:38:08.679 --> 01:38:12.541]  I hope you don't mind me asking these technical questions because I'm very curious about this too.
[01:38:12.541 --> 01:38:17.102]  And I think that, well, I mean, my next question is where could people get this therapy?
[01:38:17.102 --> 01:38:22.465]  Because their regular doctor, let's say, may not have any experience or any training in this area.
[01:38:22.465 --> 01:38:25.346]  Where do people go to even explore this possibility?
[01:38:27.062 --> 01:38:36.390]  Well, if the intravenous is not available, you need to go to taking high doses orally, and if possible, get the liposome encapsulated for them.
[01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:44.217]  With regard to the nebulization, as of this time, for $40 or $50, you buy a nebulizer online at Amazon.
[01:38:44.217 --> 01:38:45.798]  They got a little chamber.
[01:38:45.798 --> 01:38:51.603]  You put the hydrogen peroxide and a little water if you wanted more dilute in that chamber, and inhale away.
[01:38:54.369 --> 01:39:01.591]  Now, I don't know if 100,000 people order all at once, we might have a shortage on nebulizers like we have a shortage on food supplies.
[01:39:01.591 --> 01:39:07.372]  Well, plus those nebulizers are all made in China, so the supply is probably pretty limited at this point.
[01:39:07.372 --> 01:39:13.414]  But yeah, you can get those nebulizers in many places, probably even like Walmart has it right now.
[01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:15.235]  Let me say this.
[01:39:17.778 --> 01:39:36.569]  If you're blocked at all areas, you can't get the IVC, you take a lot of oral, and if you can't nebulize the hydrogen peroxide, buy a little mister, like when you spray perfume on the skin, you put hydrogen peroxide in there, open your mouth, and try to coat the back of your throat as best as you can.
[01:39:36.569 --> 01:39:42.832]  That will also knock down the viral load and allow whatever else you're doing to have a much more powerful effect
[01:39:43.351 --> 01:39:47.742]  At resolving the virus and ultimately, of course, keeping you from dying from it.
[01:39:48.214 --> 01:39:48.795]  Okay, wow.
[01:39:48.795 --> 01:39:49.755]  Great, great advice.
[01:39:49.755 --> 01:39:51.216]  Really practical advice.
[01:39:51.216 --> 01:39:53.478]  Low cost, low tech.
[01:39:53.478 --> 01:39:57.581]  Almost like prepper level emergency medicine that you can explore.
[01:39:57.581 --> 01:40:04.006]  I do want to just say that, of course, we are not offering you, the listener, specific medical advice.
[01:40:04.006 --> 01:40:07.809]  Talk with your naturopath or your complementary medicine doctor.
[01:40:07.809 --> 01:40:12.033]  Make sure that you are caring for your own particular health concern.
[01:40:12.033 --> 01:40:13.214]  But consider these options.
[01:40:13.214 --> 01:40:14.855]  That's why we have Dr. Levy on.
[01:40:14.855 --> 01:40:16.016]  These are options.
[01:40:16.016 --> 01:40:17.257]  When the government fails you,
[01:40:17.777 --> 01:40:24.320]  As it is doing everywhere around the world right now, the CDC can't even make diagnostic test kits that even work, okay?
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.502]  So the government is not your savior.
[01:40:26.502 --> 01:40:28.062]  The vaccine industry is not your savior.
[01:40:28.062 --> 01:40:29.323]  You need to learn about these alternatives.
[01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:31.424]  Let's go back to Dr. Levy.
[01:40:31.424 --> 01:40:37.968]  Now, are there any other minerals that are maybe complementary to this, such as zinc, for example?
[01:40:37.968 --> 01:40:42.430]  Anything that you offer clinically or recommend clinically that goes well with this?
[01:40:44.313 --> 01:40:48.996]  Certainly, as an anti-infection protocol, the zinc is very important.
[01:40:48.996 --> 01:40:52.458]  Also, magnesium in a bioavailable form.
[01:40:52.458 --> 01:41:03.065]  Vitamin D3 is very potent in not only preventing infections, but helping to resolve them and taking different forms of iodine.
[01:41:03.065 --> 01:41:09.529]  And sometimes, too, the iodine can be nebulized, too, along with the other things that we're talking about.
[01:41:09.529 --> 01:41:11.470]  So, all those things are important.
[01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:12.411]  I would just say that
[01:41:13.413 --> 01:41:19.535]  The more antioxidant support you can take by supplementation, the better, but there are so many out there.
[01:41:19.535 --> 01:41:35.200]  I just like to tell people, I consider the most powerful and important supplements to be magnesium, vitamin C, vitamin D3, vitamin K2, and iodine, often in the form of something like Ioderol.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:42.203]  Many, many, many other things are powerful and good, but I think all supplementation regimens should at least include those five.
[01:41:42.895 --> 01:41:56.944]  Well, that's really great advice, very important advice in this time when, if you think about right now, the people who are infected with coronavirus, according to media reports, about 4 out of 5 people have mild symptoms.
[01:41:56.944 --> 01:42:03.609]  So that means 4 out of 5 people are recovering on their own, they do not go into the serious classification where your survival rate plummets.
[01:42:03.609 --> 01:42:06.311]  If you can stay out of that serious classification,
[01:42:07.111 --> 01:42:15.915]  You may with, perhaps with some of these natural therapies, you might be able to have a 95% chance of survival or even a 99%.
[01:42:15.915 --> 01:42:17.095]  We don't know yet.
[01:42:17.095 --> 01:42:19.216]  We're just taking educated guesses.
[01:42:19.216 --> 01:42:21.597]  But you don't have to be killed by this.
[01:42:21.597 --> 01:42:23.638]  It really doesn't kill most people it infects.
[01:42:23.638 --> 01:42:24.459]  Most people survive.
[01:42:24.459 --> 01:42:26.219]  But how do we increase that number?
[01:42:26.219 --> 01:42:28.200]  That's what we're talking about with Dr. Levy.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:29.121]  We'll have more thoughts
[01:42:29.741 --> 01:42:36.489]  With Dr. Thomas Levy on the other side of this, excuse me, he's from peakenergy.com, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:36.489 --> 01:42:46.480]  Mike Adams, we'll be right back after this break with more Dr. Thomas Levy about vitamin C, minerals, and other natural protocols for boosting your immune function.
[01:42:55.691 --> 01:43:00.454]  There's a lot of things I can say about the high-quality, storable food we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:00.454 --> 01:43:06.539]  But everybody knows any product I sell is going to be high-quality at a great price because I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:43:06.539 --> 01:43:09.361]  It is my religion, the golden rule.
[01:43:09.361 --> 01:43:17.446]  But the bad news is our main sponsor that does a great job, MyPatriot, is now three to four weeks out before they ship food.
[01:43:17.446 --> 01:43:19.448]  They have the food, but they've got to package it.
[01:43:19.448 --> 01:43:23.671]  And any day now, they may come and tell me, oh, sorry, we're not selling food anymore.
[01:43:23.831 --> 01:43:26.813]  Because they're not going to take orders for food they don't have.
[01:43:26.813 --> 01:43:29.995]  Now, you get your order in now, you get the high-quality food.
[01:43:29.995 --> 01:43:31.056]  It's a smart move.
[01:43:31.056 --> 01:43:32.056]  It funds the M4.
[01:43:32.056 --> 01:43:32.957]  You can't lose.
[01:43:32.957 --> 01:43:34.958]  Take action at m4restore.com.
[01:43:34.958 --> 01:43:38.861]  Whether it's three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, six weeks, a three-month, a six-month, a year.
[01:43:38.861 --> 01:43:39.521]  Special diets.
[01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:41.963]  They've got it all at m4restore.com.
[01:43:41.963 --> 01:43:42.963]  They're in our back end.
[01:43:42.963 --> 01:43:43.964]  We're partnered with them.
[01:43:43.964 --> 01:43:46.185]  They'll ship it out to you the day it's packaged.
[01:43:46.185 --> 01:43:49.988]  They've got the food, but they are days and days behind shipping it out.
[01:43:49.988 --> 01:43:51.689]  So get your order in now to lock it in.
[01:43:51.689 --> 01:43:52.329]  And it funds the M4.
[01:43:52.329 --> 01:43:52.589]  Our 360 win.
[01:43:56.271 --> 01:43:58.732]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:05.714]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[01:44:05.714 --> 01:44:07.615]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[01:44:07.615 --> 01:44:08.075]  And the U.N.
[01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:22.760]  has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant Cloward and Piven program.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:31.109]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government, inner coronavirus.
[01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:38.197]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people
[01:44:38.217 --> 01:44:38.818]  We're good to go.
[01:44:56.849 --> 01:44:59.430]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:06.414]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[01:45:06.414 --> 01:45:16.859]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[01:45:17.299 --> 01:45:23.582]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[01:45:23.582 --> 01:45:24.562]  It is back in stock.
[01:45:24.562 --> 01:45:33.766]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[01:45:33.766 --> 01:45:41.209]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.689]  And of course,
[01:45:42.529 --> 01:45:49.277]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[01:45:49.277 --> 01:45:50.498]  And they're both back in stock.
[01:45:50.498 --> 01:45:55.364]  40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at infowarstore.com.
[01:45:56.696 --> 01:46:04.901]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[01:46:04.901 --> 01:46:05.461]  That's good.
[01:46:05.461 --> 01:46:07.863]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:07.863 --> 01:46:14.847]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[01:46:14.847 --> 01:46:18.509]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[01:46:18.509 --> 01:46:25.493]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[01:46:26.093 --> 01:46:31.296]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[01:46:31.296 --> 01:46:39.580]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:48.985]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.
[01:46:48.985 --> 01:46:54.627]  Get yours at InfoWarStore.com today, and support the Info War while living a healthy and better life.
[01:46:54.627 --> 01:46:55.048]  A total 360 win.
[01:46:59.876 --> 01:47:02.485]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.208 --> 01:47:10.349]  Big Brother.
[01:47:10.349 --> 01:47:12.251]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:12.251 --> 01:47:13.892]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:13.892 --> 01:47:15.413]  You want answers?
[01:47:15.413 --> 01:47:17.115]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:17.115 --> 01:47:19.997]  It's Mike Adams!
[01:47:19.997 --> 01:47:23.981]  And we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.981 --> 01:47:31.147]  Mike Adams filling in here while Alex is, well, at the CPAC conference area interviewing a lot of interesting guests.
[01:47:31.147 --> 01:47:34.270]  For just the next few minutes, we're going to wrap up our interview with Dr. Thomas Levy.
[01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:49.933]  Who's an expert in orthomolecular medicine, intravenous vitamin C. And I've been asking a lot of technical questions just because, personally, I'm curious and I want you, the viewer, as you process all of this information, I want it to be very practical for you.
[01:47:49.933 --> 01:47:58.734]  Because for all we know, I mean, it's possible society may break down to the point where there's never antiviral medications.
[01:47:58.734 --> 01:48:02.335]  I mean, 97% of antibiotics are made in China.
[01:48:03.254 --> 01:48:03.554]  I think?
[01:48:20.988 --> 01:48:26.932]  If taken orally, you mentioned the buffered form sodium ascorbate is what you use intravenously.
[01:48:26.932 --> 01:48:28.373]  Some people take that orally as well.
[01:48:28.373 --> 01:48:31.816]  What do you recommend orally as the best form of vitamin C?
[01:48:31.816 --> 01:48:36.919]  Or does it depend on how well the person handles the acidity of ascorbic acid?
[01:48:36.919 --> 01:48:41.442]  What's your take?
[01:48:41.442 --> 01:48:43.384]  Dr. Levy?
[01:48:43.384 --> 01:48:44.004]  Is he hearing me?
[01:48:47.122 --> 01:48:47.682]  Oh, he's frozen.
[01:48:47.682 --> 01:48:49.663]  Okay, alright.
[01:48:49.663 --> 01:48:52.063]  I thought he was pondering the question there.
[01:48:52.063 --> 01:48:54.544]  No, okay, we'll reconnect with Dr. Levy.
[01:48:54.544 --> 01:48:55.644]  He cut out there.
[01:48:55.644 --> 01:48:58.785]  My question was about what form of vitamin C works best.
[01:48:58.785 --> 01:49:00.906]  We'll get him back on and finish up that interview.
[01:49:00.906 --> 01:49:03.686]  Until then, let me give you some other breaking news updates.
[01:49:03.686 --> 01:49:09.048]  Coronavirus, live updates, Japan to close all schools through March.
[01:49:09.628 --> 01:49:18.293]  We have President Trump now insisting that America is ready for the coronavirus, which I believe is what I'm calling the Trump trap.
[01:49:18.293 --> 01:49:35.542]  I think the CDC is setting a trap for the president because once the testing is allowed to take place, then I believe we are going to see, this is my personal opinion, I can't prove it yet, we're going to see hundreds if not thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States.
[01:49:35.542 --> 01:49:36.263]  That's my belief.
[01:49:37.284 --> 01:49:42.489]  Based on projections, based on sources, and based on the fact that we are not testing.
[01:49:42.489 --> 01:49:44.711]  The CDC is only testing about 16 people a day.
[01:49:46.035 --> 01:49:46.836]  That's it.
[01:49:46.836 --> 01:49:49.777]  Only 445 people have been tested in the entire country.
[01:49:49.777 --> 01:49:58.043]  How can the CDC claim to have any surveillance whatsoever of community outbreaks if they're not testing for community outbreaks?
[01:49:58.043 --> 01:50:02.946]  In fact, I've been trying to hammer this point for days and a lot of people don't get it.
[01:50:02.946 --> 01:50:04.487]  You know who really gets this?
[01:50:04.487 --> 01:50:06.008]  Let me just mention this.
[01:50:06.008 --> 01:50:06.669]  Infowars.com
[01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:12.167]  Of course, is the tip of the spear here, but I just got to give a shout out.
[01:50:12.167 --> 01:50:14.529]  You know, Zero Hedge is covering this really well.
[01:50:14.529 --> 01:50:17.112]  Chris Martinson over at Peak Prosperity is doing a great job.
[01:50:17.112 --> 01:50:19.274]  I've been listening to his analysis as well.
[01:50:19.274 --> 01:50:21.096]  He's got a science background.
[01:50:21.096 --> 01:50:23.719]  Of course, my own coverage, a lot of people appreciate that.
[01:50:23.719 --> 01:50:26.722]  I've got pandemic.news is kind of a new hub site.
[01:50:27.282 --> 01:50:38.867]  Where we are listing later today, we're listing state-by-state the number of infections, the number of people tested, and the number of people quarantined on a state-by-state basis.
[01:50:38.867 --> 01:50:40.488]  I don't think anyone's put that together yet.
[01:50:40.488 --> 01:50:42.969]  I had my team do that research starting last night.
[01:50:43.919 --> 01:50:49.363]  And we have links to all 50 public health departments for each of the states.
[01:50:49.363 --> 01:50:55.567]  And I can tell you right now, what's shocking about these numbers is they're mostly zero tested.
[01:50:55.567 --> 01:50:56.968]  Zero, zero, zero.
[01:50:56.968 --> 01:50:58.669]  State after state after state.
[01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:59.290]  That's coming.
[01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:02.252]  We'll have that posted at the latest tonight.
[01:51:02.252 --> 01:51:11.198]  Okay, Australia has started an emergency plan, extends the travel ban amid coronavirus pandemic fears, and we have a quote from the Australian
[01:51:11.838 --> 01:51:21.941]  Prime Minister Scott Morrison, that's a little bit mind-blowing here, quote, there is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus.
[01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:32.364]  As a result, and again, this is the PM of Australia, as a result, we have initiated the implementation of the coronavirus emergency response plan.
[01:51:33.274 --> 01:51:40.043]  While the WHO is yet to declare the nature of the coronavirus and its move toward a pandemic phase, i.e.
[01:51:40.043 --> 01:51:41.705]  the WHO doesn't know what they're talking about,
[01:51:42.836 --> 01:51:46.677]  We believe that the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us.
[01:51:46.677 --> 01:51:49.998]  And as a result, as a government, we need to take steps to prepare.
[01:51:49.998 --> 01:51:51.279]  Yeah.
[01:51:51.279 --> 01:51:54.600]  Hey, wow, the PM of Australia makes perfect sense.
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:57.421]  It's the WHO that's in total denial here.
[01:51:57.421 --> 01:51:58.761]  They said yesterday.
[01:51:58.761 --> 01:52:02.642]  OK, we're going to Thomas, Dr. Levy here in just a sec.
[01:52:02.642 --> 01:52:04.023]  It was yesterday the WHO said.
[01:52:05.744 --> 01:52:09.926]  We're not going to use the word pandemic because it sounds too scary to people.
[01:52:09.926 --> 01:52:18.669]  So, is this the politically correct version of the global pandemic now where we have to coddle people's emotions instead of telling them the truth?
[01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:24.131]  I mean, they declared a pandemic when there was not one with the bird flu a few years ago.
[01:52:24.131 --> 01:52:25.411]  They were so quick.
[01:52:25.411 --> 01:52:28.532]  Oh, it's a phase six pandemic.
[01:52:28.532 --> 01:52:29.673]  Billions of dollars for vaccines.
[01:52:30.776 --> 01:52:35.361]  But now when the real thing breaks out, they're like, let's not call it a pandemic because that might freak people out.
[01:52:35.361 --> 01:52:44.870]  OK, continuing with Dr. Levy, I was asking, I don't know if you heard the question, but what form of vitamin C do you recommend for oral consumption?
[01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:46.412]  Is it the buffered form or non-buffered?
[01:52:46.412 --> 01:52:48.614]  What's your take?
[01:52:48.614 --> 01:52:53.219]  Well, actually, the sodium ascorbate is a buffered form because it doesn't upset the stomach.
[01:52:54.028 --> 01:52:56.390]  Calcium ascorbate is also used.
[01:52:56.390 --> 01:53:00.513]  I don't recommend that because I think most people have too much calcium.
[01:53:00.513 --> 01:53:03.855]  I wrote a book called Death by Calcium that addresses this.
[01:53:03.855 --> 01:53:11.040]  The best form of vitamin C to take orally, if it's available to you, is a quality liposome encapsulated form.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:18.305]  I've been a consultant to a company for 14 or 15 years and only because they have the best product I've ever seen.
[01:53:18.305 --> 01:53:20.446]  That's Live On Laboratories.
[01:53:20.446 --> 01:53:21.267]  Other products
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:30.823]  Can give you liposomes, but there's a lot of fraud in the liposome industry, so I have no confidence in other companies because of that.
[01:53:30.823 --> 01:53:35.425]  What does a liposomal encapsulation achieve?
[01:53:35.425 --> 01:53:36.425]  Explain that to our viewers.
[01:53:36.425 --> 01:53:37.366]  Well, very good.
[01:53:37.366 --> 01:53:49.610]  What it does is, even though you take it orally, you're in tiny 100 to 200 nanometer bulbs, globes, which are actually like tiny, tiny, tiny artificial cells.
[01:53:50.131 --> 01:53:56.974]  They pass into the body without any problem at all and they go into the lymph and they arm the immune system.
[01:53:56.974 --> 01:54:10.159]  They go out of the lymph into the bloodstream and then they go directly into the cells passing through pores or merging with the outside membrane by a process called reverse pyocytosis.
[01:54:10.159 --> 01:54:19.362]  But the important thing is, is you get delivery of virtually the entire amount of vitamin C you take inside your cells, even though you take it orally,
[01:54:19.793 --> 01:54:28.136]  And without the consumption of energy, all the other forms of vitamin C, you need to consume energy to get it from the blood to go inside the cell.
[01:54:28.136 --> 01:54:40.221]  So that gives it a very powerful impact and we've observed some very, I've observed some very powerful effects of quality liposomes above and beyond just regular vitamin C. But
[01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:43.990]  Nobody should be upset if they can't get a hold of it.
[01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:47.932]  You take your sodium ascorbate powder three or four times a day.
[01:54:47.932 --> 01:54:50.133]  Work yourself up to your maximal dose.
[01:54:50.133 --> 01:54:55.076]  You'll know you're at your maximal dose if you start causing a little bit of loose stool and diarrhea.
[01:54:55.076 --> 01:54:58.298]  You know, what's interesting, we're about to wrap this up and I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:54:58.298 --> 01:55:04.461]  Your website is peakenergy.com, just like how it sounds, peakenergy.com.
[01:55:04.461 --> 01:55:08.883]  Most of the raw material of ascorbic acid today is made in China.
[01:55:09.753 --> 01:55:16.599]  You know, they synthesize it there at very large quantities and they have buffered forms, of course, as well.
[01:55:16.599 --> 01:55:23.084]  I remember when we, a couple years ago, we were trying to source non-China vitamin C. It was almost impossible.
[01:55:23.084 --> 01:55:25.966]  We finally found a source out of the UK, but my goodness!
[01:55:26.787 --> 01:55:40.172]  If the world needs vitamin C and China's shut down, could we, this is my question to you, Dr. Levy, could we be facing somehow a vitamin C shortage even though it's a very low cost material?
[01:55:40.172 --> 01:55:43.273]  Could this be in short supply?
[01:55:43.273 --> 01:55:50.395]  Well, from my perspective, that's almost as scary to me as the idea of a pandemic itself.
[01:55:51.258 --> 01:56:02.622]  Is being deprived of what I consider to be the single most important protective agent you have against infection and the single most important agent you have toward helping to resolve infection.
[01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:08.224]  So that would be a super bad scenario in my opinion.
[01:56:08.224 --> 01:56:17.968]  And gosh, I don't have a lot of positive suggestions to make other than you know, all the other supplements you can take all of those provide antioxidant capacity.
[01:56:18.686 --> 01:56:28.451]  Having as quality of diet as you can, doing all the measures like cleaning your hands, not touching your face, and of course, the hydrogen peroxide.
[01:56:28.451 --> 01:56:36.875]  I've seen that work very well, sometimes on an acute viral syndrome, even without having to kick the vitamin C into high gear.
[01:56:36.875 --> 01:56:39.737]  So I wouldn't underestimate that potential intervention.
[01:56:40.216 --> 01:56:41.237]  Well, that's fascinating.
[01:56:41.237 --> 01:57:05.809]  So, killing viruses with oxygen, enhancing the immune function with vitamin C. You know, I've read that 25% of your genetic code is actually built to save your life from pathogens, but most people's genetic code is not really active because they don't have the nutritional compounds and just the nutrition and the minerals in order for that part of their immune system to function.
[01:57:05.809 --> 01:57:07.610]  So, this is very valuable information.
[01:57:07.610 --> 01:57:09.571]  Dr. Levi, I hope you'll join us again.
[01:57:10.171 --> 01:57:13.398]  It's been a pleasure to speak with you today.
[01:57:13.398 --> 01:57:14.139]  My pleasure, Mike.
[01:57:14.738 --> 01:57:15.799]  Well thank you so much.
[01:57:15.799 --> 01:57:17.380]  Peakenergy.com is his website.
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:26.327]  Now we're going to come back with Alan Keyes and he wanted to ask me a question and then he's going to take over the show after that but I don't know what he's got in mind.
[01:57:26.327 --> 01:57:30.050]  He's got some kind of brain teaser for me or something on the other side of this brick.
[01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:31.091]  We'll find out.
[01:57:31.091 --> 01:57:32.713]  Alan Keyes is standing by.
[01:57:32.713 --> 01:57:36.396]  Dr. Thomas Levy again was our guest for these couple of segments.
[01:57:36.396 --> 01:57:37.997]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:57:37.997 --> 01:57:39.418]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:39.418 --> 01:57:40.899]  We'll be back with Alan Keyes.
[01:57:40.899 --> 01:57:41.420]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.284 --> 01:57:50.545]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:57:50.545 --> 01:57:52.685]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:57:52.685 --> 01:57:55.146]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:57:55.146 --> 01:58:08.609]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[01:58:09.249 --> 01:58:09.329]  Yes.
[01:58:25.712 --> 01:58:30.695]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:58:30.695 --> 01:58:38.380]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWarsTore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:39.561]  It's amazing.
[01:58:39.561 --> 01:58:43.143]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[01:58:43.143 --> 01:58:48.027]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[01:58:48.027 --> 01:58:52.930]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers
[01:58:54.269 --> 01:58:56.377]  That without you, we won't be on the air.
[01:58:56.377 --> 01:58:57.882]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:06.046]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[01:59:06.046 --> 01:59:13.552]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[01:59:13.552 --> 01:59:22.379]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[01:59:22.379 --> 01:59:26.903]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist.
[01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:29.531]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.734 --> 02:00:11.298]  All right, now we are joined by Alan Keyes, and I'm going to turn over the whole show to Alan here, of course.
[02:00:11.298 --> 02:00:12.158]  He's taken over.
[02:00:12.158 --> 02:00:14.580]  We've had a fascinating day already.
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:24.787]  Just a whirlwind of bombshell information and practical information that can help you save your own life, potentially, as this global pandemic continues to spread.
[02:00:25.587 --> 02:00:29.649]  Alan Keyes, it's a pleasure to have you on again, and I understand you had a question for me today.
[02:00:29.649 --> 02:00:31.990]  I don't know what that is, but welcome to the show.
[02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:34.572]  Well, it's a question that should be right up your alley.
[02:00:34.572 --> 02:00:35.292]  Well, thank you.
[02:00:35.292 --> 02:00:36.333]  I'm glad to be here.
[02:00:36.333 --> 02:00:38.314]  I want to say hello to everybody.
[02:00:38.314 --> 02:00:51.261]  I'll be back for an hour today, and we'll be talking about some other possible ways to help people fortify their health in a present environment where things are getting a little iffy.
[02:00:51.261 --> 02:00:53.822]  But I was reading an article at Zero Hedge, right?
[02:00:55.124 --> 02:00:57.568]  And I think they've been doing some pretty good reporting about this.
[02:00:57.568 --> 02:01:05.098]  They're very skeptical, of course, of the notion that it's not, this virus is not something man-made.
[02:01:05.098 --> 02:01:12.548]  And in commenting on it, they actually talked about some of the things that have been speculated.
[02:01:14.004 --> 02:01:36.664]  And he said in a sentence, as a reminder, the running narrative is that the new coronavirus lay dormant in bats somewhere between 20 and 70 years, then crossed over to humans through an unknown species, before it emerged at a Wuhan, China meat market, roughly 900 feet from a level 4 bioweapons lab.
[02:01:36.664 --> 02:01:41.748]  And aside from the slightly facetious note there, I was kind of curious
[02:01:42.643 --> 02:01:46.506]  About the statement that it lay dormant, right?
[02:01:46.506 --> 02:02:00.354]  Because it immediately occurred to me that that lay dormant part, wouldn't that be something that if you were trying to weaponize a virus, you might be interested in understanding how you get the virus to lay dormant for a while?
[02:02:00.354 --> 02:02:07.119]  And if you could manipulate that, you could turn it into an even more treacherous attack on an opponent?
[02:02:07.119 --> 02:02:11.722]  Is that just idle speculation, or would that be something to look into?
[02:02:12.793 --> 02:02:15.914]  Actually, you've nailed something that I didn't even have time to talk about.
[02:02:15.914 --> 02:02:20.816]  It's the binary weapon aspect of this when you combine 5G.
[02:02:20.816 --> 02:02:31.800]  5G wireless, which the electromagnetic fields, once they interact with your skin, it produces what are called, I believe, what, peroxynitrites in your body.
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:35.402]  And it causes what are called ion-gated calcium channels, which is a calcium
[02:02:36.002 --> 02:02:39.544]  A poisoning of your cells due to the excess voltage.
[02:02:39.544 --> 02:02:43.305]  This is not ionizing radiation, but it's excess voltage from 5G.
[02:02:43.305 --> 02:02:50.328]  So isn't it interesting that in Wuhan they have 5G technology from Huawei.
[02:02:50.328 --> 02:02:53.409]  At the same time they have this virus escaping.
[02:02:53.409 --> 02:03:02.873]  Is it possible, I guess I'm asking you another question, but is it possible that it's the convergence of these two things that makes it so dangerous to people?
[02:03:02.873 --> 02:03:03.794]  I don't know the answer to that.
[02:03:04.682 --> 02:03:25.368]  I'm not claiming there's a 5G conspiracy to weaponize the virus, but when we're dealing with multiple vectors, you can have toxicity or compromise immune function from many different angles, and it seems like humanity is now in the midst of this toxic cocktail of mass poisoning through electromagnetic exposure as well as viruses and chemical exposure and hormone disruptors.
[02:03:25.368 --> 02:03:26.008]  It's a cocktail.
[02:03:26.872 --> 02:03:31.316]  Well, see, I find that everybody's being discouraged from doing conspiracy thinking.
[02:03:31.316 --> 02:03:35.579]  And yet, the advances in our technology are offering people weapons possibilities.
[02:03:35.579 --> 02:03:38.882]  Because what ran across my mind is just a speculative thought.
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:46.624]  Was that you would look into the possibility of being able to create a virus that would lay dormant until it was triggered by something.
[02:03:46.624 --> 02:03:47.244]  Yes.
[02:03:47.244 --> 02:03:55.168]  So that you could actually infiltrate a country to such a degree that once you triggered it, you might be able to wipe out a good part of its population.
[02:03:55.168 --> 02:04:02.712]  So you'd have something that was quietly as effective as nuking them out, that they wouldn't know about until it hit them.
[02:04:02.712 --> 02:04:05.974]  And that's one of those thoughts that crossed my mind and I said, whoa!
[02:04:06.977 --> 02:04:08.298]  We are in a strange age.
[02:04:08.298 --> 02:04:10.279]  You're not out of line at all.
[02:04:10.279 --> 02:04:15.742]  In fact, humans coexist with many thousands of different viral strains, most of which are harmless.
[02:04:15.742 --> 02:04:23.346]  But when the immune function is sufficiently weakened, then latent viruses in your own body emerge and start to replicate and take over.
[02:04:23.346 --> 02:04:31.531]  This can happen with something as simple as herpes or chicken pox or hepatitis A or hepatitis C. So yeah, I mean, what you're saying is absolutely true.
[02:04:31.531 --> 02:04:32.772]  Could it be weaponized?
[02:04:32.772 --> 02:04:33.272]  For sure.
[02:04:33.272 --> 02:04:35.994]  But this virus, I think, is hitting us
[02:04:36.454 --> 02:04:36.974]  Just now.
[02:04:36.974 --> 02:04:38.635]  It's not waiting for anything.
[02:04:38.635 --> 02:04:39.095]  That's right.
[02:04:39.095 --> 02:04:40.076]  It's not.
[02:04:40.076 --> 02:04:47.559]  But if they were looking to do something like that and they didn't take proper precautions, maybe they were hoist by their own petard.
[02:04:47.559 --> 02:04:48.079]  Who knows?
[02:04:48.079 --> 02:04:53.582]  Anyway, we are going to have to take a break and then we'll be right back to continue this kind of discussion.
[02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:59.411]  It's really smart to get high quality, storable food at inforestore.com.
[02:04:59.411 --> 02:05:03.172]  It's also smart to drink filtered water with Alexa Pure System.

[02:06:09.226 --> 02:06:10.606]  Welcome back!
[02:06:10.606 --> 02:06:23.033]  Well, I have my good friend Bob Sisson with me again today, and we are going to be following up on the kind of mentality that was at work in Mike Adams' presentation, because we're living in a world
[02:06:23.783 --> 02:06:28.485]  That now is posing, obviously, a threat that's focused on the coronavirus.
[02:06:28.485 --> 02:06:47.451]  But we've also, we all of us know, that on account of various and assorted changes in the human environment, because of our technology, because of things that are being done by the health industries, the pharmaceutical industry, all of these people, there are a proliferating number of ways
[02:06:48.161 --> 02:06:54.365]  In which our body is being subject to various kinds of attack from the environment in which we live.
[02:06:54.365 --> 02:07:14.820]  All these folks out there worried about what's happening to the earth and so forth and so on and meanwhile don't seem to be quite as interested in paying attention to what is happening to us in terms of this organism being subjected to all kinds of stresses and strains and attacks that we weren't used to in the course of the days before we had these massive technological advances.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:42.195]  We'll be talking about one of those today with a good friend of ours, Mark Grennan, who is coming on as our guest, to talk about something that is actually, like you were just hearing with vitamin C, a way of using or unleashing natural mechanisms that help the body to fortify itself against various dangers that have then to be dealt with by the immune system and other aspects of the body, but that are actually like cleansers.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:56.162]  That help to both clean and eliminate various toxic things, but at the same time prepare the body better to live in an environment that is as constantly dangerous as the one we now find ourselves in.
[02:07:56.162 --> 02:07:59.223]  So I'm going to turn it over to Bob so you can introduce Mark a little better.
[02:07:59.223 --> 02:07:59.983]  Alright.
[02:07:59.983 --> 02:08:10.265]  And then we can get into discussing with him something that Bob and I have been working on together in various ways and he has been in the forefront of for the last several years.
[02:08:10.902 --> 02:08:11.183]  Yeah.
[02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:13.126]  Well, thank you very much, Dr. Keyes.
[02:08:13.126 --> 02:08:15.490]  Yeah, we have Mark Grennan and one of his sons.
[02:08:15.490 --> 02:08:16.592]  I'm thinking it's John.
[02:08:16.592 --> 02:08:17.474]  I'm not for sure.
[02:08:17.474 --> 02:08:19.277]  Who we got out there, Mark?
[02:08:19.277 --> 02:08:20.579]  Joseph.
[02:08:20.579 --> 02:08:21.120]  Joseph.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.102]  OK, I'm sorry.
[02:08:22.102 --> 02:08:22.964]  Joseph.
[02:08:22.964 --> 02:08:23.625]  Yep, Joseph.
[02:08:24.406 --> 02:08:27.887]  OK, you have several sons and I can't keep up with them all.
[02:08:27.887 --> 02:08:30.607]  Welcome to the show, guys.
[02:08:30.607 --> 02:08:32.468]  Mark Grennan is a friend of mine.
[02:08:32.468 --> 02:08:42.130]  Dr. Keyes and I met up with him last summer in Denver, and we learned about chlorine dioxide and what it does.
[02:08:42.130 --> 02:08:43.690]  Of course, I'd already known.
[02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:48.892]  I've been using this in Uganda for many years, and there's a lot of neat stuff.
[02:08:48.892 --> 02:08:50.352]  But Mark, if you want to
[02:08:50.892 --> 02:08:59.885]  Open it up and tell us a little bit about what is chlorine dioxide and how does it work in the body and we got a whole hour so we're going to get a lot of information out today.
[02:09:01.061 --> 02:09:01.942]  Sure, sure.
[02:09:01.942 --> 02:09:04.743]  I just want to say thank you for having us on.
[02:09:04.743 --> 02:09:24.215]  Eleven years ago, Joe and I were praying in Santa Domingo that one day we'd be able to get on the Alex Jones Show and tell them, tell them about what we've found and through an adult man that was a minor and it's a really crazy story.
[02:09:24.215 --> 02:09:28.358]  But let me tell you, first of all, I just want to thank Alex Jones for his stand
[02:09:28.968 --> 02:09:33.713]  And I love what I just heard him say, Mike Adams also, and Alan.
[02:09:33.713 --> 02:09:41.240]  I'm glad Alex has had you on, and you're a very smart man, probably a lot smarter than me.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:44.463]  So, Bob, I don't know so much about, but... Exactly!
[02:09:44.463 --> 02:09:48.967]  I hope you're talking to Alan!
[02:09:48.967 --> 02:09:53.492]  No, but we're good friends, and what's cool is we all know the Lord.
[02:09:54.105 --> 02:09:58.230]  We all are asking God's help, and God put this together.
[02:09:58.230 --> 02:10:01.814]  So quickly, just a real quick overview.
[02:10:01.814 --> 02:10:08.982]  I found this as a missionary pilot in the Dominican Republic in Haiti, working with medical teams.
[02:10:08.982 --> 02:10:14.388]  All my family ended up working with medical teams, and we got this MRSA, this staph infection.
[02:10:14.966 --> 02:10:16.307]  From the hospitals.
[02:10:16.307 --> 02:10:17.789]  I was working in surgery.
[02:10:17.789 --> 02:10:20.031]  Joe was interpreting in surgery.
[02:10:20.031 --> 02:10:25.396]  We had a regular pharmacy in our house as missionaries, helping a lot of people.
[02:10:25.396 --> 02:10:28.078]  Well, we couldn't cure our MRSA.
[02:10:28.078 --> 02:10:31.902]  They wanted to cut off my other son's leg because of the MRSA.
[02:10:32.382 --> 02:10:43.348]  So I frantically got on the Internet and found a book by a guy, and I laughed at first and just pushed it aside, called Miracle Mineral Supplement by a guy named Jim Humble.
[02:10:43.348 --> 02:10:47.350]  I figured, well, it's a miracle, the guy's named Humble, this can't be true.
[02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:49.451]  So I just pushed it aside.
[02:10:49.451 --> 02:10:54.234]  But a couple of weeks later, I was pushed back to the Internet, and he offered his book
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:56.881]  First half for free.
[02:10:56.881 --> 02:10:59.363]  I read it and I'm like, wow, this makes sense.
[02:10:59.363 --> 02:11:07.429]  Make a long story short, I got the MMS, this is what he called it, Miracle Mineralist Solution, and I got the activator.
[02:11:07.429 --> 02:11:09.570]  I made it in my home.
[02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:12.032]  I didn't want to give it to my kids in case it killed me.
[02:11:12.032 --> 02:11:14.774]  I'd be the sacrificial lamb, I guess.
[02:11:14.774 --> 02:11:19.578]  And so I cured myself within three weeks.
[02:11:19.578 --> 02:11:21.719]  Never came back to this day.
[02:11:21.719 --> 02:11:24.121]  Joe and my other children, all eight of them,
[02:11:24.927 --> 02:11:28.150]  My wife never got it, but my other eight children did.
[02:11:28.150 --> 02:11:29.151]  All of my eight children did.
[02:11:29.151 --> 02:11:35.376]  It took about a year or so later, because by the time everybody learned... Yeah, it was about a year before we got rid of the... Do you have it?
[02:11:35.376 --> 02:11:36.217]  Do you have it today?
[02:11:36.217 --> 02:11:37.017]  No, I've been healed.
[02:11:37.017 --> 02:11:37.538]  Okay.
[02:11:37.538 --> 02:11:44.604]  So, that sent us on a journey to start praying and asking God to help us in Dominican Republic.
[02:11:44.604 --> 02:11:47.146]  Didn't know Jim Umble from Adam's house cat.
[02:11:47.591 --> 02:11:49.392]  I had no idea.
[02:11:49.392 --> 02:11:54.454]  I wrote him and thanked him for finding it, and he wrote me back, and we kind of corresponded.
[02:11:54.454 --> 02:12:08.600]  But for three years, from 2006 to 2009, we were using it all over Haiti, Dominican Republic, curing diabetes, HIV, dengue fever, cancers, stroke victims... Now, now, now, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:09.940]  Hold on a second.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:13.922]  You are telling me that all the things you just listed, you were using this MMS
[02:12:15.212 --> 02:12:22.018]  And it was actually having effects to get rid of all of these various things you talk about?
[02:12:22.018 --> 02:12:23.159]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:23.159 --> 02:12:35.869]  And the reason why we even attempted to try other things is because in Jim's book, he was in Africa trying things and he ended up just curing malaria 100% of the time in a day.
[02:12:35.869 --> 02:12:37.250]  Next day, they were fine.
[02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:38.151]  And that's a parasite.
[02:12:38.151 --> 02:12:39.552]  That's not a virus.
[02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:43.435]  So he said what happened was the cancer patients were getting cured.
[02:12:44.068 --> 02:12:46.671]  And the diabetes patient, HIV.
[02:12:46.671 --> 02:12:47.692]  And he's going, what is this?
[02:12:47.692 --> 02:12:49.013]  This is crazy.
[02:12:49.013 --> 02:12:50.134]  And then he wrote a book.
[02:12:50.134 --> 02:12:51.335]  And I got the book.
[02:12:51.335 --> 02:12:54.718]  And I'm going to say, Joe, let's try it here for other things.
[02:12:54.718 --> 02:12:56.680]  And they were getting healed.
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:59.143]  I'm using the word healed like in the Bible.
[02:12:59.143 --> 02:13:00.604]  Literally, healed.
[02:13:00.604 --> 02:13:02.306]  We call restored health, cure.
[02:13:04.499 --> 02:13:11.804]  Well, I just wanted to back up what you're saying, because I've been using this in Uganda since 2011.
[02:13:11.804 --> 02:13:23.091]  I originally went to Uganda in 1991, 20 years I stayed here working as a plumber, supporting people over there doing things, and I went back in 2011.
[02:13:23.091 --> 02:13:29.736]  I used to just take it on the airplane with me, tell the folks in Knoxville it was water treatment, which it is.
[02:13:30.416 --> 02:13:36.238]  And I took it over there and found that what you're saying is absolutely true.
[02:13:36.238 --> 02:13:46.361]  And this last year, I took Dr. Allen and Bob from the studio and we went to Uganda and we treated 2,000 people in three days.
[02:13:46.361 --> 02:13:54.343]  And we actually went during the dry season because we were going to redo the malaria test that the Red Cross did.
[02:13:54.343 --> 02:13:59.225]  By the way, you can go to YouTube, do Red Cross Malaria MMS.
[02:14:00.285 --> 02:14:11.729]  And you'll see a test that was done in 2012 where the Red Cross tested it and cured a lot of people.
[02:14:11.729 --> 02:14:13.750]  And they tried to cover it up.
[02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:17.732]  Now, when you say cure, make it clear what you mean about the malaria.
[02:14:17.732 --> 02:14:18.772]  This is just about malaria.
[02:14:18.772 --> 02:14:20.533]  I mean, it kills malaria.
[02:14:20.533 --> 02:14:22.914]  In our case, we knew how to do it.
[02:14:22.914 --> 02:14:24.094]  We tested it.
[02:14:24.094 --> 02:14:26.135]  It killed malaria in two hours.
[02:14:26.135 --> 02:14:28.896]  What that means is that the parasite is found there.
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:34.282]  And after two hours or so, it is gone.
[02:14:34.282 --> 02:14:37.925]  Now that original test, it took a day.
[02:14:37.925 --> 02:14:39.586]  They went back the next day.
[02:14:39.586 --> 02:14:44.248]  When we were over there, we were doing the same thing and within two hours,
[02:14:45.922 --> 02:14:47.563]  The parasite was gone.
[02:14:47.563 --> 02:14:51.544]  And we'll talk a little bit when we get back over the break, because this is really amazing.
[02:14:51.544 --> 02:14:56.246]  I mean, the first time I was listening to this, I was like you, Mark.
[02:14:56.246 --> 02:15:00.088]  I was thinking, ah, well, you know, this can't be, and so forth and so on.
[02:15:00.088 --> 02:15:04.390]  And then I read Jim Humble's account of what happened with him, right?
[02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:11.761]  And how folks had taken it and the next day they were up and around, uh, well, they had, supposedly they had malaria and then it was gone.
[02:15:11.761 --> 02:15:16.930]  And so you read it and you say, well, I can't, that doesn't make it, because the whole world would be all over this, right?
[02:15:17.572 --> 02:15:19.913]  Especially Africa, where you have all this malaria.
[02:15:19.913 --> 02:15:23.834]  It's the number one killer in the history of the world.
[02:15:23.834 --> 02:15:25.515]  It's killed billions of people.
[02:15:25.515 --> 02:15:25.855]  Killed.
[02:15:25.855 --> 02:15:36.258]  Now, we'll get into this, because this is the remarkable attention-getter that I think seems to be lost on so many people in the world.
[02:15:36.258 --> 02:15:38.119]  We have to ask ourselves, why is it lost?
[02:15:38.119 --> 02:15:45.241]  We'll get into all of those questions, and I know a lot of you out there might be skeptical, but you just take a careful listen right after we get back.
[02:15:53.925 --> 02:15:59.670]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:20.386]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:20.546 --> 02:16:22.327]  Not a security IPO or note.
[02:16:22.327 --> 02:16:31.850]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[02:18:36.345 --> 02:18:37.845]  Kiss the cobra.
[02:18:37.845 --> 02:18:45.608]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[02:18:45.608 --> 02:18:48.528]  Do not order those products!
[02:18:48.528 --> 02:18:50.049]  Silence Jones!
[02:18:56.013 --> 02:18:56.794]  Real stuff, man.
[02:18:56.794 --> 02:18:57.955]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:18:57.955 --> 02:19:03.359]  And I love Trump all day long, but, man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[02:19:04.781 --> 02:19:06.282]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:19:06.282 --> 02:19:07.983]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:19:07.983 --> 02:19:11.244]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:19:11.244 --> 02:19:15.046]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:19:15.046 --> 02:19:16.867]  20 different stickers.
[02:19:16.867 --> 02:19:18.508]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:19:18.508 --> 02:19:19.568]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:19:19.568 --> 02:19:20.669]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:19:20.669 --> 02:19:21.990]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:24.171]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[02:19:24.171 --> 02:19:28.953]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:19:28.953 --> 02:19:30.514]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:19:30.514 --> 02:19:31.054]  What's happening?
[02:19:31.054 --> 02:19:34.556]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:19:34.796 --> 02:19:37.999]  And Dr. Petchenik, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[02:19:37.999 --> 02:19:38.959]  It's brilliant.
[02:19:38.959 --> 02:19:46.065]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:19:46.065 --> 02:19:49.007]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:19:49.007 --> 02:19:51.830]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:58.395]  Silence.
[02:19:58.395 --> 02:20:01.037]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:22.672]  We're back.
[02:20:22.672 --> 02:20:27.617]  Now, we have been talking about MMS, or chlorine dioxide.
[02:20:27.617 --> 02:20:37.908]  And I want to get back to Mark and see if you could help folks understand a little bit, because I know that the word miracle occurs in there somewhere.
[02:20:38.872 --> 02:20:42.655]  And people often are a little suspicious of that word.
[02:20:42.655 --> 02:20:52.081]  We use it a lot with respect to all kinds of things in our sciences and, of course, in our various and assorted faiths, especially the miracles worked by Christ and so forth.
[02:20:52.081 --> 02:21:00.267]  But we're talking about something that actually has a fairly straightforward history, first of practical use as a disinfectant.
[02:21:00.714 --> 02:21:04.535]  Chlorine dioxide is used, among other things, to purify water.
[02:21:04.535 --> 02:21:15.400]  And it's used in hospitals and other places to put on surfaces that need to be cleaned in areas where people might be served food and other things like this might occur.
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:18.821]  So there is an empirical explanation.
[02:21:18.821 --> 02:21:29.165]  And I wonder if you could share with people a little bit, Mark, what is happening when taken in the right way and in the right dosage, chlorine dioxide goes to work
[02:21:30.005 --> 02:21:31.826]  Internally, helping to cleanse the body.
[02:21:31.826 --> 02:21:33.527]  What's going on?
[02:21:33.527 --> 02:21:45.275]  Okay, so let me just say that MMS is sodium chlorite with a T. It's like salt, sodium chloride, very similar, okay?
[02:21:45.275 --> 02:21:55.181]  And when you mix it with an acid, in this case we use the same acid that's in your stomach at 4% hydrochloric acid, it turns into chlorine dioxide.
[02:21:56.545 --> 02:22:03.013]  Sir Humphrey Davies in 1811 discovered how to make chlorine dioxide.
[02:22:03.013 --> 02:22:07.798]  And so it's been around, what's that, 200 and something years now?
[02:22:07.798 --> 02:22:08.559]  It's been around 219 years?
[02:22:11.312 --> 02:22:13.093]  Nine years?
[02:22:13.093 --> 02:22:14.534]  Yeah, 209 years.
[02:22:14.534 --> 02:22:16.835]  Bob's a mathematician because he's a plumber.
[02:22:16.835 --> 02:22:23.559]  But listen, so now there's over a thousand... Jim says 100,000 patents.
[02:22:23.559 --> 02:22:28.341]  I've found 30,000 patents for chlorine dioxide.
[02:22:28.341 --> 02:22:33.704]  And to even get the approval for a patent, you have to, at least in theory, prove that it works.
[02:22:33.704 --> 02:22:38.147]  And many of them are medical applications for chlorine dioxide, like you said.
[02:22:38.587 --> 02:22:39.988]  They use it in hospitals.
[02:22:39.988 --> 02:22:41.970]  They use it in the anthrax scare.
[02:22:41.970 --> 02:22:44.632]  They tent the whole building.
[02:22:44.632 --> 02:22:45.773]  Kill the anthrax.
[02:22:45.773 --> 02:22:48.115]  They use it in the Katrina disaster.
[02:22:48.115 --> 02:22:51.758]  They kill all the black mold in the houses by tenting the houses.
[02:22:51.758 --> 02:22:54.100]  They use it in the gymnasiums.
[02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:55.221]  Purification.
[02:22:55.221 --> 02:22:56.322]  Cans.
[02:22:56.322 --> 02:22:58.924]  All the cans are sprayed with that so nothing will grow.
[02:22:59.324 --> 02:23:00.125]  Before they can.
[02:23:00.125 --> 02:23:03.246]  Chlorine dioxide gas is used to kill MRSA in locker rooms.
[02:23:03.246 --> 02:23:04.507]  In locker rooms?
[02:23:04.507 --> 02:23:06.168]  On meat packing plants.
[02:23:06.168 --> 02:23:09.650]  We used to sell chicken in Dominican Republic in 80.
[02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:11.831]  And that we could smell the chlorine dioxide.
[02:23:11.831 --> 02:23:15.193]  They spray all the chickens and you don't have to wash it off.
[02:23:15.193 --> 02:23:16.494]  Because it's non-toxic.
[02:23:16.494 --> 02:23:18.876]  It turns into... Sodium chloride.
[02:23:18.876 --> 02:23:19.716]  Salt.
[02:23:19.716 --> 02:23:20.897]  Sodium chloride.
[02:23:20.897 --> 02:23:26.020]  So, Mark... I would also like to mention, if you don't mind me interrupting for a second.
[02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:45.103]  That Carrie Rivera at CarrieRivera.com has a great interview that she did with Stephanie Seneff, the MIT scientist, where she shows that it not only destroys glyphosate, which is a major issue today, but it converts it into three elements that your body needs.
[02:23:45.623 --> 02:23:47.504]  So, you can't get any better than that.
[02:23:47.504 --> 02:23:51.647]  It kills the stuff that's trying to kill us, and it makes it help us.
[02:23:51.647 --> 02:23:52.628]  Praise the Lord.
[02:23:52.628 --> 02:24:03.536]  I think it's really important to give people a sense of what's going on, because we know that in the world out there, it has various and assorted uses that are not in any way toxic.
[02:24:03.536 --> 02:24:05.618]  You can inhale, and so forth and so on.
[02:24:06.678 --> 02:24:08.679]  We're talking about actually taking it.
[02:24:08.679 --> 02:24:16.644]  It was just like on the segment that Mike Adams did, where you're injecting vitamin C in a certain form, so it's being used internally.
[02:24:16.644 --> 02:24:18.786]  What is actually going on in the body?
[02:24:18.786 --> 02:24:19.506]  Okay.
[02:24:19.506 --> 02:24:28.672]  Okay, so when you ingest chlorine dioxide, and they put it in water, and you ingest the water, it's so, they're already doing it at a government level.
[02:24:28.672 --> 02:24:30.173]  It's EPA approved.
[02:24:30.173 --> 02:24:31.694]  It's FDA approved.
[02:24:31.694 --> 02:24:33.435]  So, when it goes in your mouth,
[02:24:34.184 --> 02:24:36.025]  What it does, it's an oxidizer.
[02:24:36.025 --> 02:24:40.889]  And this is where people think, oxidation is just throwing oxygen at something.
[02:24:40.889 --> 02:24:42.590]  No, it's a voltage.
[02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:47.514]  And oxygen has a voltage of 1.3 volts.
[02:24:47.514 --> 02:24:58.902]  So when it's in the body, that voltage, that oxidizer called oxygen, will go and make electrons come, it's an electron receiver from pathogens.
[02:24:58.902 --> 02:25:00.203]  Now, if oxygen
[02:25:00.993 --> 02:25:03.695]  Doesn't hurt good things in your body.
[02:25:03.695 --> 02:25:05.636]  So, how can chlorine dioxide?
[02:25:05.636 --> 02:25:09.699]  Well, it can't because it's only 0.95 volts.
[02:25:09.699 --> 02:25:11.480]  It's not strong enough.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:17.363]  If oxygen can't kill or hurt something good, we definitely can't with chlorine dioxide.
[02:25:17.363 --> 02:25:23.507]  But the cool thing is, all the pathogens, the viruses, the bacteria, the funguses, 99% of them
[02:25:25.317 --> 02:25:26.118]  I don't know.
[02:25:43.860 --> 02:25:52.986]  So now, isn't there a video like quantumleap.is that explains a lot of this and also has a lot of testimonies?
[02:25:52.986 --> 02:26:01.192]  And then speaking of testimonies, don't you have somewhere where our viewers can and our listeners can go to to see a lot of testimonies?
[02:26:01.192 --> 02:26:07.817]  We have thousands and thousands of testimonies of people who have been gotten better using this.
[02:26:08.945 --> 02:26:19.097]  Sure, we think millions have been taking it around the world and have tried it, and we know just in the water people have tried it, but the government putting it in there.
[02:26:19.097 --> 02:26:25.764]  But what we do is every week we put out a newsletter called the G2ChurchNews.org.
[02:26:26.866 --> 02:26:26.986]  Yes.
[02:26:43.494 --> 02:26:44.914]  Just ask Alan.
[02:26:44.914 --> 02:26:47.455]  He mentions us and he gets attacked.
[02:26:47.455 --> 02:26:50.856]  You know, because he was a former ambassador and they attack him.
[02:26:50.856 --> 02:26:52.356]  What are you doing with this cult?
[02:26:52.356 --> 02:26:57.738]  Well, if we were a cult, we wouldn't tell you how to make this in your own home.
[02:26:57.738 --> 02:26:59.258]  You don't even have to talk to us.
[02:26:59.258 --> 02:27:02.499]  We'll show you how to make it free on videos.
[02:27:02.499 --> 02:27:07.000]  We'll show you how to take it free on videos and you can do that.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.021]  We want you to practice self-care.
[02:27:09.421 --> 02:27:14.029]  There's a Bible verse that I want to just mention just before you talk.
[02:27:14.029 --> 02:27:15.932]  It's found in 1 Corinthians 3.
[02:27:15.932 --> 02:27:18.036]  This is our verse that we follow.
[02:27:18.627 --> 02:27:23.709]  Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
[02:27:23.709 --> 02:27:28.331]  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.
[02:27:28.331 --> 02:27:31.552]  For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.
[02:27:31.552 --> 02:27:34.813]  And we want to clean out the temple by detoxing.
[02:27:34.813 --> 02:27:35.594]  And guess what?
[02:27:35.594 --> 02:27:43.517]  When you do that, and build up the body's systems, stop toxins from coming in, it starts working like God intended.
[02:27:44.468 --> 02:27:51.334]  Yeah, then God Himself, and that's what we say, you detox your body properly and then God Himself comes along and heals you.
[02:27:51.334 --> 02:27:52.415]  Praise the Lord.
[02:27:52.415 --> 02:27:57.459]  Hey, I have your book here, Imagine a World Without Disease.
[02:27:57.459 --> 02:28:05.065]  You can get that on Genesis2Church.is or G2ChurchBooks.
[02:28:05.065 --> 02:28:09.469]  We have a special site, G2ChurchBooks.org.
[02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:10.670]  This is the first volume.
[02:28:11.306 --> 02:28:17.091]  That's the second volume, and this is more about why your body's in a diseased state.
[02:28:17.091 --> 02:28:19.733]  There's not many diseases, folks.
[02:28:19.733 --> 02:28:21.074]  There's only one disease.
[02:28:21.074 --> 02:28:24.277]  It's in a state of disease, your body, or it's not.
[02:28:24.277 --> 02:28:32.344]  Now, a hundred years ago, there were only twelve listed diseases, and only about a hundred... Mark, let's get a little bit further into that.
[02:28:32.344 --> 02:28:36.668]  We're coming up on a break here, but I just want people to realize that you're listening to this.
[02:28:37.248 --> 02:28:44.155]  That this is something that is aimed at making your body stronger by eliminating things that are putting pressure on your health.
[02:28:44.155 --> 02:28:45.376]  That's all it is.
[02:28:45.376 --> 02:28:46.377]  So, give it some thought.
[02:28:46.377 --> 02:28:48.659]  We'll be right back to continue this discussion.
[02:28:54.144 --> 02:28:57.166]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[02:28:57.166 --> 02:29:00.067]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[02:29:00.067 --> 02:29:07.271]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[02:29:07.271 --> 02:29:12.514]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.
[02:29:12.514 --> 02:29:15.676]  FlashRouters uses a virtual private network, or VPN,
[02:29:15.776 --> 02:29:15.996]  We're good.
[02:29:33.024 --> 02:29:36.048]  Call or click Flash Routers today at 1-866-509-5817 or flashrouters.com.

[02:29:37.369 --> 02:29:42.335]  Protect your wireless home network today with Flash Routers.
[02:29:54.778 --> 02:30:00.600]  I want to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:04.142]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:30:04.142 --> 02:30:06.462]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[02:30:06.462 --> 02:30:08.263]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[02:30:08.263 --> 02:30:09.864]  So here I am telling people.
[02:30:10.624 --> 02:30:15.848]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:30:15.848 --> 02:30:17.108]  And I'm 45 years old.
[02:30:17.108 --> 02:30:19.070]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:20.771]  And it's fluoride-free.
[02:30:20.771 --> 02:30:24.033]  I think the big difference, the game-changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[02:30:24.033 --> 02:30:27.636]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[02:30:27.636 --> 02:30:32.319]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[02:30:32.319 --> 02:30:34.680]  It feels so good.
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:37.762]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[02:30:37.762 --> 02:30:40.044]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[02:30:40.804 --> 02:30:51.953]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels There can no longer be any doubt
[02:30:57.970 --> 02:31:01.955]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[02:31:01.955 --> 02:31:03.277]  It's very communicable.
[02:31:03.277 --> 02:31:05.279]  It spreads very, very fast.
[02:31:05.279 --> 02:31:07.261]  It is killing a lot of people.
[02:31:07.261 --> 02:31:10.986]  And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[02:31:10.986 --> 02:31:13.929]  And the White House is now openly challenging them.
[02:31:13.929 --> 02:31:17.013]  So are Trump's top scientists, and so is Senator Cotton.
[02:31:17.814 --> 02:31:22.438]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[02:31:22.438 --> 02:31:24.800]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:28.543]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[02:31:28.543 --> 02:31:31.425]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[02:31:31.425 --> 02:31:34.988]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared.
[02:31:34.988 --> 02:31:38.111]  InfoWarsStore.com has the products that
[02:31:38.271 --> 02:31:39.012]  We're good to go.
[02:31:54.997 --> 02:32:01.542]  Keith Bansumer powers the great line of high quality storable food we have available at ReadyHour and InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:01.542 --> 02:32:03.284]  And yes, we're selling storable food here.
[02:32:03.284 --> 02:32:07.827]  What concerns me is we're a month into this and food sales aren't going down, they're going up.
[02:32:07.827 --> 02:32:09.569]  You've never seen anything like this?
[02:32:09.569 --> 02:32:11.250]  Never, never like this.
[02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:12.191]  And sustained.
[02:32:12.191 --> 02:32:15.133]  You know, it started, you know, 27 days ago and it kind of went hyper.
[02:32:15.533 --> 02:32:17.235]  And it doesn't fall off.
[02:32:17.235 --> 02:32:20.758]  And in even recent days, you know, it's further increasing.
[02:32:20.758 --> 02:32:21.819]  The semis are rolling.
[02:32:21.819 --> 02:32:22.640]  The chips are in.
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:25.142]  We're producing as much as quickly as possible.
[02:32:25.142 --> 02:32:27.484]  Orders that are getting in today, they're gonna ship.
[02:32:27.484 --> 02:32:29.406]  They're gonna just ship in 10 to 14 days.
[02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:30.927]  We're helping people prepare.
[02:32:31.147 --> 02:32:33.048]  It's just something you cover.
[02:32:33.048 --> 02:32:33.408]  Absolutely.
[02:32:33.408 --> 02:32:35.928]  You like to eat daily, and so we're just backing that up.
[02:32:35.928 --> 02:32:37.429]  It's the best insurance out there.
[02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:41.950]  You can get food today that you can eat 10 years from now at today's prices.
[02:32:41.950 --> 02:32:45.551]  It's normal to sit on top of horrible food and guns.
[02:32:45.551 --> 02:32:46.671]  All our forebearers did it.
[02:32:46.671 --> 02:32:47.591]  We've got food.
[02:32:47.591 --> 02:32:48.612]  We've got guns.
[02:32:48.612 --> 02:32:49.592]  We've got Jesus.
[02:32:49.592 --> 02:32:50.492]  We know how to use it.
[02:32:50.492 --> 02:32:51.892]  We've got a phrase around here, Alex.
[02:32:51.892 --> 02:32:52.833]  It's real simple.
[02:32:52.833 --> 02:32:53.793]  Noah prepared.
[02:32:57.757 --> 02:33:01.363]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:01.363 --> 02:33:06.470]  We're back!
[02:33:14.104 --> 02:33:15.245]  Now, I want to take a little minute.
[02:33:15.245 --> 02:33:28.182]  I'm going to ask Bob to go into his experience with this, because a lot of times you will hear folks talking about things like this, and they're out there and in the world we live in now, especially when it has to do with anything that has to do with y'all.
[02:33:28.182 --> 02:33:32.888]  Everybody's looking to make a billion dollars and take over this and take over that and so forth and so on.
[02:33:33.448 --> 02:33:54.386]  The remarkable thing, and it's one of those things that has really attracted my attention to all of this, is that when you get into the cost factor of MMS, it's a remarkable story that promises to bring something that can really fortify health within the reach of poorer people, poorest people in fact, throughout the world.
[02:33:54.386 --> 02:33:57.149]  What does that look like when you start to go through it?
[02:33:57.529 --> 02:34:01.513]  Well, I just wanted to I want to share with y'all.
[02:34:01.513 --> 02:34:04.896]  We've been we've been using this in Uganda for a long time.
[02:34:04.896 --> 02:34:12.483]  And when we needed to resupply, I got on the Alibaba and got over and I ordered some out of China.
[02:34:12.483 --> 02:34:19.289]  Turns out I'm probably the largest on using it for something like this that there is on the planet.
[02:34:19.289 --> 02:34:20.470]  I order it by the ton.
[02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:22.172]  Everybody else gets it in these little bottles.
[02:34:22.452 --> 02:34:25.995]  I think that's why God sat me in this chair today to talk to y'all.
[02:34:25.995 --> 02:34:32.180]  But the reality is, if we buy this in bulk, and I ordered some again last night, because I think the price is going to go up.
[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:38.685]  We're going to show you people out there in just a minute that you can make your own, you can distribute it to your whole area.
[02:34:38.685 --> 02:34:49.794]  I made 400 bottles of this three weekends ago, another 400 bottles two weekends ago, and I was using 40 pounds of sodium chlorite, and that's with a T.
[02:34:50.595 --> 02:35:04.559]  Now, if you buy this by the ton, like I could out of China at one point, I can fill this bottle, and Mark's probably don't want me to hear this, but for seven pennies, I can fill this bottle right here.
[02:35:04.559 --> 02:35:07.340]  A lot cheaper than the bottle cost, I might add.
[02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:14.782]  And this would last a young couple in America more than a year if they were taking it at an accelerated rate.
[02:35:14.782 --> 02:35:19.464]  When you talk about how easy it is to make, though, I went over to Uganda.
[02:35:20.763 --> 02:35:27.910]  And participated in a few days when we had folks coming in from different places.
[02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:32.414]  Some of the poorer areas that you can imagine.
[02:35:32.414 --> 02:35:36.838]  Folks who have a hard time even getting hold of water and things like this.
[02:35:36.838 --> 02:35:38.140]  Right?
[02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:40.982]  And how many pennies a day?
[02:35:40.982 --> 02:35:42.103]  Or pennies per dose?
[02:35:44.125 --> 02:35:45.126]  What are we talking about?
[02:35:45.126 --> 02:35:54.032]  We calculated that Biden bought, you can cure 800 people, not cure, but you can treat 800 people with malaria for $1.
[02:35:54.032 --> 02:35:54.052]  $1.
[02:35:54.052 --> 02:35:55.333]  $800 for $1.
[02:35:55.333 --> 02:36:05.041]  Now, this on a continent where malaria is one of those things that is holding back the ability to develop the potential of human beings throughout the continent.
[02:36:05.041 --> 02:36:07.943]  And you would think, well, jump at a chance to try to find out.
[02:36:07.943 --> 02:36:11.926]  And the thing that bothers me about what's going on in the so-called health sector these days
[02:36:12.586 --> 02:36:17.909]  Is if they can't figure out some way to make billions of dollars off of it, they don't want to pay any attention.
[02:36:17.909 --> 02:36:31.875]  And yet there are poor people suffering all around the world who could really do with an inexpensive way to try to strengthen the body in order either to avoid or help to deal with the things that will be constantly attacking it in our present environment.
[02:36:31.875 --> 02:36:34.837]  I just wanted to go into that because I think this is remarkable.
[02:36:34.837 --> 02:36:39.419]  And so then you go over there and you can actually help people in bulk, right?
[02:36:39.419 --> 02:36:41.020]  By a means that you can share
[02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:43.090]  They can make it at home.
[02:36:43.090 --> 02:36:56.074]  Well, yeah, and Mark, please forgive me for a minute, but I really wanted to get this out because Melania Trump has been mistreated by people over here horribly, and I'm ashamed of our people, the way they act.
[02:36:56.074 --> 02:37:06.537]  But, you know, she has an interest in helping the people of Africa, and I was going to ask President Trump if he would allow us, with her blessing, to go over there, we can put this
[02:37:07.378 --> 02:37:14.404]  In Uganda, everybody lives in these little mud huts, maybe 15 feet around with a thatched roof on it.
[02:37:14.404 --> 02:37:20.810]  But we can put this in every one of those mud huts in all of Uganda for $400 million.
[02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:31.500]  Sounds like a lot, and that's at $2, figuring distribution costs, labeling, whatever, that's at $2, 200 million of these, and that should about do it, 1.2 billion people.
[02:37:32.981 --> 02:37:37.928]  So the challenge is now for President Trump to make this happen.
[02:37:37.928 --> 02:37:43.194]  Melania would then be the most famous person, woman on the planet.
[02:37:43.194 --> 02:37:48.842]  I have to take advantage of this moment to make sure that we don't have people coming down on Bob.
[02:37:48.842 --> 02:37:51.145]  I know what people are like these days and he just said...
[02:37:51.525 --> 02:37:53.126]  You know, everybody living in mud huts.
[02:37:53.126 --> 02:37:55.307]  Everybody in Uganda does not live in mud huts.
[02:37:55.307 --> 02:37:56.308]  We know this.
[02:37:56.308 --> 02:37:59.529]  It's just that all of the folks that Bob is working with.
[02:37:59.529 --> 02:38:00.430]  You understand?
[02:38:00.430 --> 02:38:04.692]  Now you understand what this man is about.
[02:38:04.692 --> 02:38:07.313]  And he's not about making money or doing any of that.
[02:38:07.313 --> 02:38:13.776]  He's about going to the poorest of the poor and doing something, as Christ would have his heart do, to help out.
[02:38:13.776 --> 02:38:19.860]  And I think y'all have been pretty much motivated in the same vein at Genesis 2.
[02:38:19.860 --> 02:38:20.460]  Isn't that right, Mark?
[02:38:21.573 --> 02:38:24.474]  Yes, ten years ago we started the church with Jim Upple.
[02:38:24.474 --> 02:38:28.375]  He came and lived with us for three years, and we told him what we've been doing.
[02:38:28.375 --> 02:38:35.296]  He's been showing us what he's been doing, and we just took off and started this Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing.
[02:38:35.296 --> 02:38:39.277]  I was a missionary pilot, so I was already working with medical teams.
[02:38:39.277 --> 02:38:41.418]  They couldn't help with the MRSA.
[02:38:41.418 --> 02:38:46.979]  I saw the MMS did, and I started using it for other things, so we just started a church.
[02:38:46.979 --> 02:38:49.060]  Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing.
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:49.940]  Anybody's welcome!
[02:38:50.581 --> 02:38:51.222]  Anybody.
[02:38:51.222 --> 02:38:53.904]  You don't even have to become a member for us to help you.
[02:38:53.904 --> 02:39:00.028]  We want you to know how to do this, practice self-care, get this stuff, and make it yourself.
[02:39:00.028 --> 02:39:04.551]  If you can't, look it, we even have a thing where you can take on the plane now, okay?
[02:39:04.551 --> 02:39:12.337]  A travel kit that, well, you can take right on the plane for people that are traveling, but we tell people, make it yourself if you have to.
[02:39:12.337 --> 02:39:17.501]  Most people won't, so you gotta have it available, and the reason why I was telling you about that verse
[02:39:18.602 --> 02:39:31.212]  The disease state of the body is caused by toxins through the food, through the medication, through the air, through the bad water, through the clothing, the things we breathe, the things we're taking in our mouth.
[02:39:31.212 --> 02:39:46.245]  And what chlorine dioxide does, it takes all those toxins out, and the heavy metals, and the fungus, and kills the cancer, and the bad bacteria, and the bad viruses, because there are good ones, and the parasites.
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:49.402]  It's a selective oxidizer.
[02:39:49.402 --> 02:39:55.346]  It's so simple to do, and you can take it in your water bottle.
[02:39:55.346 --> 02:39:57.207]  You can carry it with you.
[02:39:57.207 --> 02:39:59.088]  Now, let me tell you about this.
[02:39:59.088 --> 02:40:03.772]  The viruses we've dealt with, because this is the topic of the day, is Ebola.
[02:40:03.772 --> 02:40:07.034]  We cured it in Sierra Leone.
[02:40:07.034 --> 02:40:07.774]  Cured it.
[02:40:07.774 --> 02:40:11.517]  I'm going to use that word as a church, because these preachers in the streets
[02:40:12.037 --> 02:40:16.719]  I mean, not in the streets, in the campaign, saying, in Jesus' name, you're healed!
[02:40:16.719 --> 02:40:17.759]  You're cured!
[02:40:17.759 --> 02:40:19.960]  So I can say cure, heal, I'm a church.
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:20.760]  Okay?
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:22.101]  And we did that with Ebola.
[02:40:22.101 --> 02:40:23.681]  We did that with dengue.
[02:40:23.681 --> 02:40:25.102]  These are viruses.
[02:40:25.102 --> 02:40:26.222]  We did that with Zika.
[02:40:27.003 --> 02:40:31.365]  We did that with chikungunya, an outbreak in Dominican Republic.
[02:40:31.365 --> 02:40:32.386]  Chagas.
[02:40:32.386 --> 02:40:35.928]  Those are all viruses, and the Ebola is amazing.
[02:40:35.928 --> 02:40:37.348]  You hemorrhage everywhere.
[02:40:37.348 --> 02:40:40.470]  Nothing like this, this coronavirus flu.
[02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:42.371]  On the back of the Clorox bottle...
[02:40:42.871 --> 02:40:47.432]  Not to be confused, Clorox is not this, but it is a chlorine.
[02:40:47.432 --> 02:40:50.053]  It says it will cure coronavirus.
[02:40:50.053 --> 02:40:55.235]  There's a patent for chlorine dioxide to cure coronavirus also.
[02:40:55.235 --> 02:40:58.676]  So it's already been proven, folks, that it can cure this.
[02:40:58.676 --> 02:41:00.817]  You don't have to... I don't get worried about this.
[02:41:00.817 --> 02:41:05.518]  I told Bob and Bob said to me, we'll go to a hospital without mask.
[02:41:05.518 --> 02:41:09.139]  Let us go in there and treat everybody in the hospital.
[02:41:09.139 --> 02:41:11.080]  I'll be taking the doses, guarantee you.
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:13.442]  I'll be having a bottle right here.
[02:41:13.442 --> 02:41:15.383]  Maybe a little stronger.
[02:41:15.383 --> 02:41:21.068]  But I'll be, I'll do that to prove to the world that this will kill the coronavirus.
[02:41:21.068 --> 02:41:21.588]  Count me in.
[02:41:21.588 --> 02:41:29.615]  Well, one of the things that I think is important for people to realize, we're not telling anything here and we're not trying to convince you of something because we think
[02:41:30.749 --> 02:41:35.031]  And believe that people need to investigate for themselves.
[02:41:35.031 --> 02:41:37.932]  But what I will say to you is you need to take a look at this.
[02:41:37.932 --> 02:41:39.633]  You need to be thinking about it.
[02:41:39.633 --> 02:41:41.773]  You need to be reading the material on it.
[02:41:41.773 --> 02:41:48.216]  And when you have digested the facts, then come to a conclusion about what you think it's capable of.
[02:41:48.976 --> 02:41:50.037]  That's what I did.
[02:41:50.037 --> 02:41:51.439]  It's why I went over with Bob.
[02:41:51.439 --> 02:41:54.541]  It's why I have been taking MMS myself.
[02:41:54.541 --> 02:41:56.443]  And I think that this is remarkable.
[02:41:56.443 --> 02:41:59.506]  Not so much for me, but for the implications.
[02:41:59.506 --> 02:42:12.478]  In a world where they're telling us that everything must cost billions upon billions upon billions of dollars, it appears that God has provided us with a path that is available to people who don't have those billions.
[02:42:13.098 --> 02:42:30.722]  And if we were investing ourselves in making sure people got the knowledge about this, that knowledge would now help them to go a long way toward better health in the environments in which they now have to live because of our technology, but also because of things that have plagued mankind for a long time.
[02:42:30.722 --> 02:42:32.522]  We're going to continue this discussion.
[02:42:32.522 --> 02:42:35.323]  We'll be right back after this message.
[02:42:54.833 --> 02:42:55.614]  Real stuff, man.
[02:42:55.614 --> 02:42:56.775]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:42:56.775 --> 02:43:02.542]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him, everybody.
[02:43:03.601 --> 02:43:05.122]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:43:05.122 --> 02:43:06.823]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:43:06.823 --> 02:43:10.064]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:43:10.064 --> 02:43:14.466]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:43:14.466 --> 02:43:15.707]  20 different stickers.
[02:43:15.707 --> 02:43:17.328]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:43:17.328 --> 02:43:18.408]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:43:18.408 --> 02:43:19.489]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:20.830]  Infowars.com.
[02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:22.991]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[02:43:22.991 --> 02:43:27.813]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:43:27.813 --> 02:43:29.354]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:43:29.354 --> 02:43:29.874]  What's happening?
[02:43:29.874 --> 02:43:31.415]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[02:43:31.415 --> 02:43:33.396]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:43:33.636 --> 02:43:36.817]  And Dr. Pachetnik, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[02:43:36.817 --> 02:43:37.797]  It's brilliant.
[02:43:37.797 --> 02:43:44.880]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:47.841]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:43:47.841 --> 02:43:50.662]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:43:50.662 --> 02:43:51.282]  Silence.
[02:43:53.450 --> 02:43:57.273]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[02:43:57.273 --> 02:44:02.117]  Now we're bringing you an all-new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.

[02:44:54.927 --> 02:45:00.469]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:03.890]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[02:45:03.890 --> 02:45:04.450]  Yeah.
[02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:06.151]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[02:45:06.151 --> 02:45:07.031]  I love women.
[02:45:07.031 --> 02:45:08.631]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[02:45:08.631 --> 02:45:10.012]  You may have problems with her.
[02:45:10.012 --> 02:45:11.292]  You may get a divorce.
[02:45:11.292 --> 02:45:11.892]  You may whatever.
[02:45:11.892 --> 02:45:16.634]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful when I left.

[02:45:43.761 --> 02:45:44.762]  We've sold out.
[02:45:44.762 --> 02:45:46.765]  Just like we've done with supplements and other things.

[02:45:54.614 --> 02:45:57.217]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[02:45:57.217 --> 02:46:04.203]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[02:46:04.203 --> 02:46:14.654]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[02:46:15.074 --> 02:46:21.357]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[02:46:21.357 --> 02:46:22.337]  It is back in stock.
[02:46:22.337 --> 02:46:31.561]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[02:46:31.561 --> 02:46:39.005]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[02:46:39.005 --> 02:46:39.465]  And of course,
[02:46:40.285 --> 02:46:47.052]  Vladimir 12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[02:46:47.052 --> 02:46:57.822]  And they're both back in stock, 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:46:57.822 --> 02:47:00.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.570 --> 02:47:23.096]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:47:23.096 --> 02:47:24.837]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:47:24.837 --> 02:47:29.300]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:33.983]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:37.796 --> 02:47:39.257]  Welcome back.
[02:47:39.257 --> 02:47:47.584]  No, Alex Jones hasn't, you know, made a drastic change in his looks.
[02:47:47.584 --> 02:47:57.552]  I'm Alan Keyes, and though in many ways, if you listen to me, I think I probably resemble Alex Jones a little bit, we certainly act from the same sense of the world.
[02:47:57.552 --> 02:48:03.337]  I was there mouthing the words with that wonderful quotation from Thomas Jefferson, which, by the way, is in the Rotunda.
[02:48:04.237 --> 02:48:06.880]  And at Jefferson Memorial, you can go look at it.
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:10.004]  And it's one of those sentiments that I certainly share.
[02:48:10.004 --> 02:48:22.317]  And it's what Alex Jones and InfoWars and I and others who are trying to just share information, get people to think about things clearly, because in point of fact, tyranny over the mind,
[02:48:22.917 --> 02:48:43.645]  It's not that they want you to stop using it, they just want you to use it in the way they tell you, for the things they tell you, rather than in the way God expected for the things that are actually going to help benefit and preserve you and all mankind if you are just willing to follow the path He has laid out for this very good thinking instrument that we have.
[02:48:44.406 --> 02:48:48.270]  And so if you're willing to use your mind in the right way, you can come to the right conclusions.
[02:48:48.270 --> 02:48:52.275]  And I think that what we're talking about here today on the show is one of those things.
[02:48:52.275 --> 02:48:58.522]  Now, we have said repeatedly, Mark, that this is something that it's easy for people to do.
[02:48:59.082 --> 02:49:04.464]  It's kind of, not only learn it for yourself, but test it out for yourself.
[02:49:04.464 --> 02:49:21.850]  Can you give, just quickly run through, the simple process by which if they had this combination of bottles right here, with MMS and HDL, they would actually be able to prepare, for example, a little test dose for themselves.
[02:49:21.850 --> 02:49:27.592]  Okay, just so people know, you'll add one drop of this with one drop of this.
[02:49:27.592 --> 02:49:28.512]  MMS in the activator.
[02:49:29.079 --> 02:49:31.720]  You wait 30 seconds, you see it turn in amber.
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:35.481]  You had three out four ounces of water and that's your first dose.
[02:49:35.481 --> 02:49:37.862]  We treat every illness on earth.
[02:49:37.862 --> 02:49:39.523]  We start the same way.
[02:49:39.523 --> 02:49:42.684]  As it gets more involved, we may be back down.
[02:49:42.684 --> 02:49:44.285]  But that's as simple as that.
[02:49:44.285 --> 02:49:53.388]  Now, I want to say this, the coronavirus, I would take six drops of this, six drops of this in four ounces of water after it activated.
[02:49:53.388 --> 02:49:55.829]  And I take that every two hours for the first
[02:49:56.613 --> 02:49:57.454]  Thank you very much.
[02:50:20.184 --> 02:50:23.147]  Would you mind doing the equivalent of that?
[02:50:23.147 --> 02:50:29.471]  If people do this with the right dosage in the right way, what kind of side effects can they expect?
[02:50:29.471 --> 02:50:34.415]  For 13 years I've been having people come to us 30 days at a time, okay?
[02:50:34.415 --> 02:50:42.000]  And we see all the side effects you can imagine from people with tumors like this to, you know, just internal things.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:47.064]  The worst side effects, because we don't let it get any worse than this, is little diarrhea,
[02:50:47.865 --> 02:50:48.286]  We're good to go!
[02:51:07.549 --> 02:51:08.150]  And that's it.
[02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.750]  That's it.
[02:51:08.750 --> 02:51:12.414]  Maybe a little headache, maybe a little stomachache if you're going too fast.
[02:51:12.414 --> 02:51:14.736]  You back down, it goes away.
[02:51:14.736 --> 02:51:17.359]  Even stop for a day and start again.
[02:51:17.359 --> 02:51:20.002]  Half a drop, a drop an hour, and you work up.
[02:51:20.002 --> 02:51:28.551]  The most people do, and this is fourth stage cancer people, the most they do is three drops an hour with some other things we might add.
[02:51:29.091 --> 02:51:31.612]  And that's it, to cure their cancer.
[02:51:31.612 --> 02:51:37.733]  It might take a year, if they've been growing something for a couple years, or it might take a few months.
[02:51:37.733 --> 02:51:39.234]  If it's diabetes, it'd be less.
[02:51:39.234 --> 02:51:41.514]  If it's HIV, it'd be less time.
[02:51:41.514 --> 02:51:42.335]  I have to mention this.
[02:51:42.335 --> 02:51:51.237]  Now you're actually saying that, wait, you're actually saying that, with a regimen such as you described, you have had people who have been relieved of these problems.
[02:51:52.205 --> 02:51:53.226]  Yes, sir.
[02:51:53.226 --> 02:51:54.726]  We've had thousands.
[02:51:54.726 --> 02:51:59.769]  You can go to mmstestimonials.co and you can see thousands.
[02:51:59.769 --> 02:52:01.150]  It's categorized.
[02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:06.332]  We have it in Spanish, too, on iglesiahenesisdos.org.
[02:52:06.332 --> 02:52:07.993]  So we have it in Spanish.
[02:52:07.993 --> 02:52:09.554]  But I have to do this, Alan.
[02:52:09.554 --> 02:52:10.554]  Give me two minutes.
[02:52:10.554 --> 02:52:12.335]  I mean, two seconds.
[02:52:12.335 --> 02:52:19.059]  I'd be amiss not to mention Jim Humble, our hero, that it really, this is not, this is the book you want to get.
[02:52:19.059 --> 02:52:21.500]  You don't want to get his first book because it's so out of date.
[02:52:22.140 --> 02:52:25.803]  MMS Health Recovery Guidebook by Jim Humble.
[02:52:25.803 --> 02:52:33.248]  And this is the Bible, you know, I don't say that word lightly, but Bible means book.
[02:52:33.248 --> 02:52:35.030]  This is the MMS Bible.
[02:52:35.030 --> 02:52:37.872]  It'll tell you how to give it to kids, to dogs, and everything.
[02:52:37.872 --> 02:52:44.777]  The books I have, I really think people should have them also because I would really like Alex to read this book.
[02:52:45.407 --> 02:52:52.489]  And talk about why we have disease on the earth, and then the history of what we've been doing in the second volume.
[02:52:52.489 --> 02:52:56.830]  And I give away the first e-book for free.
[02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:59.931]  So if you don't want to buy the whole book, you don't have to.
[02:52:59.931 --> 02:53:03.452]  But I want them to see, look, read this, and if you want the rest of it,
[02:53:04.173 --> 02:53:13.800]  Yeah, and it's even got the protocols, and we have the protocols on video also to tell you exactly step-by-step how to do it from starting procedure, protocol 1000.
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:19.764]  We have them named differently, but all of them are there free on the internet for anybody who has the MMS.
[02:53:19.764 --> 02:53:27.370]  They can go ahead and do these protocols and detox, and they can cure themselves from all these different diseases because we have hundreds of testimonies.
[02:53:27.370 --> 02:53:28.651]  Yeah, hundreds, thousands!
[02:53:31.604 --> 02:53:39.847]  So tell us again exactly what website to go to to get the e-book, because we have a lot of people that want to see that book.
[02:53:39.847 --> 02:53:42.028]  g2churchbooks.org.
[02:53:44.946 --> 02:53:45.547]  That's just a two?
[02:53:45.547 --> 02:53:46.888]  Yeah, number two.
[02:53:46.888 --> 02:53:48.189]  Yeah, that's a number two, yes.
[02:53:48.189 --> 02:53:49.670]  G2 Church Books.
[02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:55.735]  We were thrown off after Alan mentioned about the two hour thing that we paid for back in last year.
[02:53:55.735 --> 02:53:57.497]  We were thrown off YouTube.
[02:53:57.497 --> 02:53:59.278]  Millions of views.
[02:53:59.278 --> 02:54:01.220]  Millions on our testimonies.
[02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:02.061]  They took us off.
[02:54:02.641 --> 02:54:05.582]  Google even wrote an algorithm against us.
[02:54:05.582 --> 02:54:06.842]  They own YouTube.
[02:54:06.842 --> 02:54:08.783]  We've been hit by the papers.
[02:54:08.783 --> 02:54:14.264]  Every seminar we go to, they try to show up and break up our church service.
[02:54:14.264 --> 02:54:16.085]  Even in England, they did it to us.
[02:54:16.085 --> 02:54:18.425]  We threw them out because we're a church.
[02:54:18.425 --> 02:54:20.386]  Now, you can also go.
[02:54:20.386 --> 02:54:25.407]  Genesis2church.is is where you can find a link to everything.
[02:54:25.407 --> 02:54:28.048]  Our weekly newsletter, the documentary.
[02:54:29.448 --> 02:54:46.162]  Well, this is why we're using Mike Adams' Brighteon now, and we encourage everybody to get to Brighteon, forget YouTube, and I've got a caution for all the people, these big tech people that are messing with God's people.
[02:54:46.162 --> 02:54:53.389]  I'm going to warn you guys, not a lot of times either, you better be careful because God is now stepping in on behalf of His people
[02:54:54.069 --> 02:55:13.275]  And this is going to get, it's going to be a situation where God comes along, He put President Trump in office, and He put Melania there, obviously, and when you attack these people that God put in office, including Alex Jones, and a shout out to Alex, he presents the gospel very clearly.
[02:55:13.275 --> 02:55:15.496]  Choose this day whom you will serve.
[02:55:15.496 --> 02:55:19.217]  It's either God or the devil, and you've got two choices.
[02:55:19.217 --> 02:55:21.918]  Choose wisely, because your eternity depends on it.
[02:55:22.458 --> 02:55:28.402]  But anyway, be careful because everybody that attacks God's people is really attacking God.
[02:55:28.402 --> 02:55:31.103]  It's not Alex Jones or President Trump they don't like.
[02:55:31.103 --> 02:55:34.205]  It's God Himself that people don't like.
[02:55:34.205 --> 02:55:37.407]  And that's about as dumb as it gets, trying to attack God.
[02:55:37.407 --> 02:55:41.870]  So that's just a little warning for all our friends out there that are trying to shut us down.
[02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:49.235]  There's going to be a time coming really soon when everybody realizes that the living God intends to hail everybody.
[02:55:50.074 --> 02:55:59.623]  One of the things that I think we always have to keep in mind when we're thinking about all these attacks, because we have been attacked, and I thought it was kind of... Actually, I'm sorry, I found it kind of amusing.
[02:55:59.623 --> 02:55:59.823]  Why?
[02:56:00.535 --> 02:56:06.580]  Because they can't attack you if you're walking the walk in God's way, except by lying.
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:07.481]  And so they just lie.
[02:56:07.481 --> 02:56:14.666]  And they portray poor Bob here as somebody who's some money-grubbing individual out there trying to make money off poor people.
[02:56:14.666 --> 02:56:16.648]  It's all just a lie.
[02:56:16.648 --> 02:56:20.751]  But if you look at the facts, and this is why they're trying to discourage people from doing it,
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:33.292]  See, because if you go out and you seek out those facts for yourself and you look at the truth for yourself, then you can make your own judgment about what is going on and about the people who are involved in it.
[02:56:33.292 --> 02:56:36.695]  And that's all that I would say I recommend that you do.
[02:56:36.695 --> 02:56:44.723]  Because I think if you are looking at the facts, if you are thinking these things through for yourself, if you decide that you want to give it a test for yourself,
[02:56:45.583 --> 02:56:49.304]  Then you can come to conclusions, as I myself did.
[02:56:49.304 --> 02:57:02.387]  But I think, keep in the back of your mind while you're doing it, that a lot of the things that go on these days are being manipulated by people, and the one goal they do have in mind is to make sure that this is done, or if it's presented.
[02:57:02.387 --> 02:57:12.250]  Why wouldn't you want to research something like this, and scientifically establish beyond any reasonable doubt the truth about it, so that it could then be widely available to people around the world?
[02:57:12.250 --> 02:57:13.330]  Do you know why they're not doing it?
[02:57:14.136 --> 02:57:18.019]  Because they figured they can't make billions upon billions of dollars from it.
[02:57:18.019 --> 02:57:22.663]  And if they haven't figured out a way to monetize it, as they say, they don't want to get it out there.
[02:57:22.663 --> 02:57:23.984]  Well, we do.
[02:57:23.984 --> 02:57:26.186]  So go look for yourself.
[02:57:26.186 --> 02:57:29.328]  If you have the time, you've got the internet, we've got the means.
[02:57:29.328 --> 02:57:30.629]  Go look for yourself.
[02:57:30.629 --> 02:57:31.750]  Think it through.
[02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:35.933]  And then make your own judgment about what's going to be best for your health.
[02:57:35.933 --> 02:57:40.037]  In the environment we're living in right now, it's an imperative.
[02:57:40.037 --> 02:57:41.218]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:57:43.763 --> 02:57:47.006]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[02:57:47.006 --> 02:57:49.388]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[02:57:49.388 --> 02:58:02.639]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades, because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[02:58:02.639 --> 02:58:05.982]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:05.982 --> 02:58:09.885]  So right now, humanity's awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[02:58:10.666 --> 02:58:20.011]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on Jim Fulworth's hit, Tip the Spear, is your financial support.
[02:58:20.011 --> 02:58:22.932]  We make it really easy at jimfulworthstore.com.
[02:58:22.932 --> 02:58:26.874]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now.
[02:58:29.232 --> 02:58:30.193]  We're good to go.
[02:58:44.639 --> 02:58:51.283]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election, and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[02:58:51.283 --> 02:59:01.729]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up.
[02:59:02.369 --> 02:59:11.712]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[02:59:11.712 --> 02:59:17.393]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfoWarStore.com and stock up on high quality preparedness items.

[02:59:54.893 --> 03:00:01.559]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.559 --> 03:00:06.504]  America is awake!
[03:00:06.504 --> 03:00:08.366]  That's what's happening now, get ready for it!
[03:00:15.618 --> 03:00:17.579]  I came here tonight because I wanted to meet Alex.
[03:00:17.579 --> 03:00:20.641]  I wanted to meet a number of you.
[03:00:20.641 --> 03:00:26.004]  And the vibe so far has just been nothing but support.
[03:00:26.004 --> 03:00:35.570]  I can tell you that I kind of describe what's been going on with my family and everything else that's happened with all this Russiagate sh**.
[03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:39.032]  And it's kind of like this long boxing match.
[03:00:39.032 --> 03:00:40.433]  We're kind of in the 15th round now.
[03:00:40.433 --> 03:00:42.854]  We feel like things are kind of winding down.
[03:00:44.482 --> 03:00:57.346]  You know, it's like, you take so many gut punches and things happen and you just kind of become numb to everything, but we have an absolute bulldog in our corner right now, and her name is Sydney Powell.
[03:00:57.346 --> 03:00:57.586]  And she...
[03:01:00.649 --> 03:01:10.418]  You know, we wish, you know, hindsight is what it is, but, you know, would it have been great for her to be, you know, our lawyer from the beginning?
[03:01:10.418 --> 03:01:16.343]  Yes, but, you know, things happen and, you know, you make, you know, certain decisions, but at the end of the day... Lay out what happened.
[03:01:16.343 --> 03:01:17.083]  Tell them.
[03:01:17.083 --> 03:01:18.525]  Yeah, I mean... Start from the beginning.
[03:01:18.945 --> 03:01:26.353]  Well, kind of going off with what Ivan said, I mean, Crossfire Hurricane did not begin July 31st.
[03:01:26.353 --> 03:01:28.215]  It just didn't.
[03:01:28.215 --> 03:01:35.583]  I mean, we know that my father was set up from as early as 2015, maybe even before that.
[03:01:35.583 --> 03:01:37.485]  I mean, he was absolutely targeted.
[03:01:38.326 --> 03:01:42.287]  Because of his loud voice against the Obama administration.
[03:01:42.287 --> 03:01:47.069]  I mean, I'll never forget a conversation that he and I had whenever he retired from the DIA.
[03:01:47.069 --> 03:01:56.812]  He said, look, you know, we talked about getting into business together, but then he said, you know, look, I'm tired of listening to the Obama administration lie to the American public about the ISIS threat.
[03:01:57.692 --> 03:02:11.160]  And that's really when we got on a roll in the media and he went on to various talk shows and instantly became a target because he was out there basically calling out Obama and all these other deep state officials that were just out there.
[03:02:12.346 --> 03:02:13.287]  What's up?
[03:02:13.287 --> 03:02:15.048]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:02:15.048 --> 03:02:18.610]  So anyways, it's been a long journey.
[03:02:18.610 --> 03:02:28.316]  It's so complex what's going on with this case right now from December 2015 and then all of a sudden we're at the RNC convention.
[03:02:28.316 --> 03:02:30.337]  That happened and then August 10th...
[03:02:31.798 --> 03:02:40.166]  Was really when the, you know, three individuals were opened up, uh, you know, in Crossfire Hurricane, uh, August 16th was when, uh, the D.F.
[03:02:40.166 --> 03:02:43.809]  State decided to open up an investigation, you know, on General Flynn.
[03:02:43.809 --> 03:02:48.153]  The very next day, the August 17th date that, uh, that Ivan Reikland, uh, mentioned,
[03:02:49.154 --> 03:02:49.434]  I don't know.
[03:03:04.602 --> 03:03:04.902]  I think?
[03:03:19.950 --> 03:03:26.497]  The D.I.A., the day before we left for the trip, and two weeks after we got back from the trip.
[03:03:26.497 --> 03:03:30.520]  Perfectly sanctioned, told them everything that, you know, as far as what we're gonna do.
[03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:36.847]  I mean, everything that he talked about while we were in Russia, you know, is available to the public.
[03:03:36.847 --> 03:03:37.427]  So that was it.
[03:03:37.427 --> 03:03:40.090]  I mean, there was absolutely no reason why these guys
[03:03:41.858 --> 03:03:41.938]  No.
[03:04:04.364 --> 03:04:17.169]  Going into January, and obviously I think most people know about the January 24th interview that, you know, where the two agents were sent into the White House by, you know, the ass****s that are, you know, Comey and McCabe.
[03:04:17.169 --> 03:04:24.932]  I mean, I'm personally sick and tired of reading Comey's tweets and John Brenner for that matter.
[03:04:24.932 --> 03:04:28.293]  I mean, you look at what these guys say and it's like, these guys were the heads
[03:04:29.053 --> 03:04:31.975]  The heads of some of the most powerful agencies in the world?
[03:04:31.975 --> 03:04:41.282]  It's just so mind-boggling to me that these guys were running our most secret organizations, if you will.
[03:04:41.282 --> 03:04:47.367]  And so, from really the end of January of 2017 to December 1st of 2017, when he was forced to plead guilty.
[03:04:53.058 --> 03:05:01.263]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[03:05:01.263 --> 03:05:01.823]  That's good.
[03:05:01.823 --> 03:05:04.225]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[03:05:04.225 --> 03:05:11.209]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[03:05:11.209 --> 03:05:14.891]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[03:05:14.891 --> 03:05:21.855]  And that means, even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[03:05:22.455 --> 03:05:27.657]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[03:05:27.657 --> 03:05:35.940]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[03:05:35.940 --> 03:05:45.344]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.
[03:05:45.344 --> 03:05:50.987]  Get yours at InfoWarStore.com today, and support the Info War while living a healthy and better life.
[03:05:50.987 --> 03:05:51.407]  A total 360 win.
[03:06:02.731 --> 03:06:06.252]  People ask me all the time, why did he plead guilty?
[03:06:26.613 --> 03:06:28.413]  Let me think about it.
[03:06:28.413 --> 03:06:31.354]  I can tell you unequivocally that I was absolutely threatened.
[03:06:31.354 --> 03:06:34.835]  I was absolutely threatened with being indicted.
[03:06:34.835 --> 03:06:39.036]  And I'm sure everybody knows who Sean Hannity is.
[03:06:39.036 --> 03:06:44.178]  He's been a loud voice for us, but he absolutely is correct that
[03:06:44.798 --> 03:06:59.845]  You know, I had a father that absolutely fell on the sword to protect me from going through something that I would have had to put my then four-month-old and my wife through, okay?
[03:06:59.845 --> 03:07:03.186]  And look, I'm not up here looking for sympathy.
[03:07:03.186 --> 03:07:06.248]  I'm just letting you know that this is the truth.
[03:07:06.248 --> 03:07:08.969]  This is what happened.
[03:07:08.969 --> 03:07:10.470]  My father's not guilty of anything.
[03:07:10.470 --> 03:07:12.071]  I think everybody here knows that.
[03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:16.323]  Yeah, thank you, thank you.
[03:07:16.323 --> 03:07:18.286]  So, look, last thing I'll say is that
[03:07:21.283 --> 03:07:24.444]  The story is so complex.
[03:07:24.444 --> 03:07:26.025]  I want you to keep going for another 20 minutes.
[03:07:26.025 --> 03:07:27.425]  We've got plenty of time.
[03:07:27.425 --> 03:07:29.246]  We have like an hour of question and answer.
[03:07:29.246 --> 03:07:39.169]  Talk about your father as a patriot and what you guys went through and the vindication now that the whole lie is coming down and Roger Stone, everything.
[03:07:39.169 --> 03:07:40.749]  Just tell them what happened.
[03:07:40.749 --> 03:07:45.811]  Tell them in five minutes what happened, what you guys went through as American patriots.
[03:07:45.811 --> 03:07:47.772]  Yeah.
[03:07:49.437 --> 03:08:03.546]  I mean, as far as what you can picture, you know, just a regular, you know, American, you know, military family who essentially wasn't, I mean, we weren't wealthy people to begin with.
[03:08:03.546 --> 03:08:16.695]  I mean, we had, you know, my father and I had, you know, had a private business, you know, after we left the D.I.A., but, you know, we weren't making, we weren't raking in, you know, millions of dollars, and then, you know, all of a sudden this stuff, you know, kind of came down with having to, you know, hire lawyers and...
[03:08:20.538 --> 03:08:28.963]  Yeah, well, I mean, again, the deep state went out with my father because he was outspoken on a number of things.
[03:08:28.963 --> 03:08:34.666]  The main thing was Obama's signature foreign policy, which was the Iran deal.
[03:08:34.666 --> 03:08:41.450]  I mean, the Iran deal, and I'm not an expert on Iran, but I can tell you that the Iran deal was a big thing that he was highly against.
[03:08:47.233 --> 03:08:48.794]  Major critic of that.
[03:08:48.794 --> 03:09:01.182]  But the other part of it is he was willing to call out how much the deep state and specifically CIA and FBI had become very very political organizations.
[03:09:01.182 --> 03:09:06.166]  And that's still, I mean you see what's going on in the news and you see what's happening with
[03:09:06.946 --> 03:09:17.989]  You know, with all these partisans that we just saw with this impeachment process, with Adam Schiff, all these just political bureaucrats that got up in front of national television.
[03:09:17.989 --> 03:09:26.091]  And it's as clear as day, just listening to these people, you know, I mean, like how in the tank they are for, you know, for the left.
[03:09:26.091 --> 03:09:32.633]  And I mean, as far as, I mean, I can tell you that my father has wanted to speak out about this stuff.
[03:09:33.553 --> 03:09:39.560]  Like ever since day one, but for obvious reasons, he hasn't been able to.
[03:09:39.560 --> 03:09:49.512]  But again, I mentioned Sidney Powell and how she's been a big advocate and obviously very, very outspoken for us.
[03:09:50.632 --> 03:09:58.554]  You know, that's a big deal after all the persecution you've gone through to come here and speak on these live feeds out here.
[03:09:58.554 --> 03:10:00.654]  But let's get back to the beginning of the few minutes we have left.
[03:10:00.654 --> 03:10:02.494]  I appreciate you coming here today and your courage to do it.
[03:10:02.494 --> 03:10:04.395]  I know you and your family have been persecuted.
[03:10:04.395 --> 03:10:05.075]  I've been persecuted.
[03:10:05.075 --> 03:10:06.095]  We know what it's like.
[03:10:06.095 --> 03:10:08.236]  We get persecuted because we support America.
[03:10:08.236 --> 03:10:12.456]  We realize that persecution is actually a blessing and we don't see ourselves as victims.
[03:10:12.456 --> 03:10:14.317]  Some people listen to what this guy is saying because his dad
[03:10:15.017 --> 03:10:20.238]  Just like Roger Stone and just like so many other people, they've tried to put his father in prison.
[03:10:20.238 --> 03:10:29.960]  They've tried to hold years in prison and bankrupting them to lie about President Trump and lie about the populist election we had.
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:30.861]  So I hear a lot of talk.
[03:10:30.861 --> 03:10:31.921]  I love you guys.
[03:10:31.921 --> 03:10:32.901]  Just respect.
[03:10:32.901 --> 03:10:35.402]  Everybody just stop talking for one second.
[03:10:35.402 --> 03:10:36.362]  Just one second.
[03:10:37.344 --> 03:10:38.445]  One second!
[03:10:38.445 --> 03:10:40.908]  Just one second in your lives!
[03:10:40.908 --> 03:10:46.293]  His father wanted to serve America and try to defend our Republic!
[03:10:49.318 --> 03:11:00.085]  And because he did that, they targeted him because he wanted to put in the Trump administration patriots that would promote freedom worldwide.
[03:11:00.085 --> 03:11:11.373]  They were scared of the army that George Washington founded 245 years ago, finally getting control of the government again from these communists and these globalists.
[03:11:11.373 --> 03:11:15.175]  And then they launched every attack they had.
[03:11:15.175 --> 03:11:18.718]  And now, four years later, all their designs have failed.
[03:11:19.678 --> 03:11:25.080]  But the people like General Flynn are such humble men who just defend their country.
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:28.061]  They're not like me, a wicked devil.
[03:11:28.061 --> 03:11:30.361]  They don't see all the angles.
[03:11:30.361 --> 03:11:36.083]  And now that they've been victorious, they are silent in the face of their victory.
[03:11:36.083 --> 03:11:38.424]  We have discredited Obama!
[03:11:39.204 --> 03:11:41.745]  We have discredited Hillary.
[03:11:41.745 --> 03:11:43.846]  We have restored the Republic.
[03:11:43.846 --> 03:11:46.347]  We have defeated the Chi-Coms.
[03:11:46.347 --> 03:11:49.268]  America has had a great victory.
[03:11:49.268 --> 03:11:54.470]  But America doesn't have a media to tell you the victory you've had.
[03:11:54.470 --> 03:11:57.471]  So General Flynn faces fake sentencing.
[03:11:57.471 --> 03:12:02.033]  And I say, like I've told Roger Stone, call their bluff.
[03:12:02.033 --> 03:12:04.214]  Because we've done nothing wrong.
[03:12:04.214 --> 03:12:05.134]  We're good people.
[03:12:05.134 --> 03:12:06.915]  So as General Flynn said, oh God bless you.
[03:12:10.501 --> 03:12:14.983]  You sit up here, you try to explain how you're this good person.
[03:12:14.983 --> 03:12:17.464]  We know you're good.
[03:12:17.464 --> 03:12:20.325]  We know your father's good.
[03:12:20.325 --> 03:12:29.128]  You don't get attacked by CNN and MSNBC and ABC if you're evil.
[03:12:29.128 --> 03:12:32.370]  You get attacked when you're good.
[03:12:32.370 --> 03:12:33.090]  We know that.
[03:12:34.420 --> 03:12:37.642]  And America is rising now.
[03:12:37.642 --> 03:12:39.463]  And the enemy knows it.
[03:12:39.463 --> 03:12:40.763]  So hey, let's go.
[03:12:40.763 --> 03:12:41.804]  Finish up.
[03:12:41.804 --> 03:12:44.505]  Talk about your... I'm stronger than ever.
[03:12:44.505 --> 03:12:45.686]  Don't be strong.
[03:12:45.686 --> 03:12:47.247]  Tell them the truth.
[03:12:47.247 --> 03:12:47.607]  Close it.
[03:12:49.230 --> 03:12:54.477]  Alright, I mean the last thing I'll say is that we still have a fight in front of us.
[03:12:54.477 --> 03:13:02.088]  We have a couple of motions out there right now that we're still waiting on this Judge Emmett Sullivan to either grant or deny.
[03:13:02.088 --> 03:13:03.710]  There's kind of a battle of...
[03:13:05.586 --> 03:13:06.266]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:13:06.266 --> 03:13:08.867]  There's no question about that.
[03:13:08.867 --> 03:13:13.209]  I think, again, I mentioned the whole boxing round analogy.
[03:13:13.209 --> 03:13:15.770]  To me, it feels like we're at the end of this.
[03:13:15.770 --> 03:13:21.293]  I can just tell you right now that something has got to happen before this election in November.
[03:13:21.493 --> 03:13:23.513]  I mean, something has to happen.
[03:13:23.513 --> 03:13:29.075]  I'm sick and tired of reading about all the potential fixes and what we're going to do here and there.
[03:13:29.075 --> 03:13:30.795]  I want to see people held accountable.
[03:13:30.795 --> 03:13:36.696]  I'm tired, again, I'm tired of these guys running their mouths on Twitter, running their mouths on social media.
[03:13:36.696 --> 03:13:39.677]  I want to see, let's just see one big name arrested.
[03:13:39.677 --> 03:13:42.058]  Just one.
[03:13:42.058 --> 03:13:44.418]  I don't care if it's Brennan or Cuomo.
[03:13:44.418 --> 03:13:44.998]  Just one of them.
[03:13:47.719 --> 03:13:49.721]  Just one of them, okay?
[03:13:49.721 --> 03:14:01.629]  Because look, behavior is not going to change if something, you know, we throw around that word accountability and it just doesn't feel like accountability is happening right now.
[03:14:01.629 --> 03:14:02.450]  And trust me...
[03:14:03.511 --> 03:14:07.215]  I'm just as frustrated, if not more, than the next person.
[03:14:07.215 --> 03:14:15.083]  And all we can do is continue to do things like this, you know, speak out, and let it be known that you're just as f***ed off as I am.
[03:14:15.083 --> 03:14:20.549]  That, hey, you know, Bill Barr, John Durham, I know you're out there, but let us know what the hell you're doing.
[03:14:23.154 --> 03:14:23.694]  Yeah, that too.
[03:14:23.694 --> 03:14:30.220]  Is your father going to go after them for civil rights violations?
[03:14:30.220 --> 03:14:35.404]  I'd love to be able to answer that, but again, I'm going to defer all questions like that to Sidney Powell.
[03:14:35.404 --> 03:14:43.070]  Sidney Powell, if you ever want to contact her, you can always reach her website, but she's probably one of the most open, transparent people that you'll ever meet.
[03:14:43.070 --> 03:14:44.972]  She's family to us now, and I'm telling you,
[03:14:45.712 --> 03:14:52.140]  I mean, just kind of stay tuned, because there's certain things that can't be made public that will be made public.
[03:14:52.140 --> 03:14:58.587]  And, you know, I hate to even say stuff like that, but at the end of the day, we're going to win.
[03:14:58.587 --> 03:14:59.768]  Let me say this.
[03:14:59.768 --> 03:15:02.031]  By the way, Michael Flynn Jr.
[03:15:02.031 --> 03:15:03.372]  came here humbly today.
[03:15:04.033 --> 03:15:14.878]  To expose the persecution his father, a noble army officer, has gone through defending this republic and trying to secure our future.
[03:15:14.878 --> 03:15:16.338]  And so, come back over here.
[03:15:16.338 --> 03:15:18.959]  You're a very humble person, just like your father.
[03:15:18.959 --> 03:15:21.480]  You don't have much work coming.
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:24.602]  And I'm here to tell you, we need to stop
[03:15:25.848 --> 03:15:27.169]  Being humble about what's happened.
[03:15:27.169 --> 03:15:29.511]  Your dad's been a patriot his whole life.
[03:15:29.511 --> 03:15:30.652]  He stood up to the globalists.
[03:15:30.652 --> 03:15:32.353]  He tried to give Trump good advice.
[03:15:32.353 --> 03:15:33.254]  He was persecuted.
[03:15:33.254 --> 03:15:34.815]  He's a hero.
[03:15:34.815 --> 03:15:36.657]  And we need to celebrate our heroes.
[03:15:36.657 --> 03:15:38.658]  People that got Congressional Medal of Honors, they're wonderful.
[03:15:38.658 --> 03:15:41.160]  People that got Silver Stars, Bronze Stars, they're amazing.
[03:15:41.160 --> 03:15:42.041]  We love them.
[03:15:42.041 --> 03:15:45.024]  But this is the real fight for America right now.
[03:15:45.024 --> 03:15:51.489]  And you're humble about this, but you came up here tonight, I know, under major pressure and persecution.
[03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:57.631]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[03:15:57.631 --> 03:16:02.733]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[03:16:02.733 --> 03:16:10.456]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[03:16:10.456 --> 03:16:18.339]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[03:16:18.499 --> 03:16:20.300]  Not a security IPO or note.
[03:16:20.300 --> 03:16:29.804]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[03:16:29.804 --> 03:16:30.645]  Don't miss this one.

[03:16:51.414 --> 03:16:55.276]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:16:55.276 --> 03:17:00.278]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[03:17:18.849 --> 03:17:21.372]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:21.372 --> 03:17:22.593]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:22.593 --> 03:17:26.516]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:26.516 --> 03:17:28.058]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:28.058 --> 03:17:31.020]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:31.020 --> 03:17:36.225]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:36.565 --> 03:17:37.767]  I can help you too.
[03:17:37.767 --> 03:17:40.711]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:40.711 --> 03:17:42.935]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:42.935 --> 03:17:47.381]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[03:17:47.381 --> 03:17:49.064]  That's DanPilla.com.
[03:17:49.064 --> 03:17:49.725]  DanPilla.com.
[03:17:52.904 --> 03:18:04.597]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[03:18:04.597 --> 03:18:13.407]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[03:18:14.068 --> 03:18:18.632]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[03:18:18.632 --> 03:18:21.874]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side.
[03:18:21.874 --> 03:18:24.556]  And they do what they do because they're slaves.
[03:18:24.556 --> 03:18:29.640]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:40.063]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[03:18:40.063 --> 03:18:42.803]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[03:18:42.803 --> 03:18:45.364]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[03:18:45.364 --> 03:18:48.465]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[03:18:48.465 --> 03:18:51.886]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[03:18:52.586 --> 03:18:53.746]  Don't be a victim.
[03:18:53.746 --> 03:18:58.608]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[03:18:58.608 --> 03:19:02.889]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[03:19:02.889 --> 03:19:05.270]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[03:19:05.270 --> 03:19:08.751]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[03:19:08.751 --> 03:19:10.411]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[03:19:10.411 --> 03:19:14.032]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[03:19:14.032 --> 03:19:17.773]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver
[03:19:18.013 --> 03:19:23.858]  That's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown that go after this whole Corona SARS family of viruses.
[03:19:23.858 --> 03:19:26.420]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[03:19:26.420 --> 03:19:31.004]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[03:19:31.004 --> 03:19:32.165]  Great to have, period.
[03:19:32.165 --> 03:19:33.746]  Really good for your gums, really great for your
[03:19:33.826 --> 03:19:35.047]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:02.602 --> 03:20:09.625]  All the people watching out there on the internet and everybody here in person, why you decided to come out and speak up for your father tonight.
[03:20:09.625 --> 03:20:12.786]  I think it's because you know the tide has turned.
[03:20:12.786 --> 03:20:14.546]  The hoax is broken.
[03:20:14.546 --> 03:20:16.407]  We're Americans.
[03:20:16.407 --> 03:20:18.268]  We're not Russian Asians.
[03:20:18.268 --> 03:20:21.829]  We love our country.
[03:20:21.829 --> 03:20:23.310]  We believe in America.
[03:20:23.310 --> 03:20:24.310]  Why did you come out tonight?
[03:20:26.164 --> 03:20:27.905]  I came up here with Ivan Riegland.
[03:20:27.905 --> 03:20:29.006]  I don't know where he's at.
[03:20:29.006 --> 03:20:31.928]  He's around here somewhere.
[03:20:31.928 --> 03:20:38.331]  Ivan's always dragging, pulling me in five different directions.
[03:20:38.331 --> 03:20:41.333]  We were at CPAC before and I'm going to be there in the next couple of days.
[03:20:43.034 --> 03:20:47.856]  I came here because I knew some of the Infowar guys were going to be here, especially Alex Jones.
[03:20:47.856 --> 03:20:53.499]  We've actually never met in person, so it's certainly a great honor to meet Alex Jones.
[03:20:53.499 --> 03:21:00.242]  I know and obviously followed your story, and I certainly appreciate everything that you've been through.
[03:21:00.242 --> 03:21:07.965]  I can't imagine what the deplatforming has done with some of these ridiculous tech companies.
[03:21:07.965 --> 03:21:09.986]  But at the end of the day, you're still here.
[03:21:09.986 --> 03:21:10.667]  You're still standing.
[03:21:12.207 --> 03:21:15.210]  You're still doing your thing, and that's important.
[03:21:15.210 --> 03:21:19.553]  And trust me, what I will say, because I had this conversation, and this is the last thing I'll say.
[03:21:19.553 --> 03:21:22.155]  I had this conversation with my father all the time.
[03:21:22.155 --> 03:21:26.438]  I said, look, your time is not done with America.
[03:21:26.438 --> 03:21:33.504]  You know that once this is all said and done, that you're going to be pulled back into the scene in one way, shape, or form.
[03:21:33.504 --> 03:21:34.084]  I don't know what that is.
[03:21:35.645 --> 03:21:41.292]  I'm not going to speak for my father in that regard, but I can tell you that his time is not done.
[03:21:41.292 --> 03:21:49.441]  He will get his ass back out there and speak out about the things that need to be spoken out about.
[03:21:52.685 --> 03:21:53.606]  That's right.
[03:21:53.606 --> 03:22:01.269]  General Flynn bet on America three-plus years ago and tried to put the White House stocked with patriots.
[03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:03.931]  He was attacked as enemy number one.
[03:22:03.931 --> 03:22:07.052]  And now, four years later, we are turning the tide.
[03:22:07.052 --> 03:22:08.453]  His son is here with us tonight.
[03:22:08.453 --> 03:22:09.413]  This is a beautiful time.
[03:22:09.413 --> 03:22:10.234]  God bless you.
[03:22:10.234 --> 03:22:12.035]  Tell your father we're indebted to him.
[03:22:12.035 --> 03:22:14.576]  We appreciate him.
[03:22:14.576 --> 03:22:15.396]  Powerful.
[03:22:15.396 --> 03:22:16.717]  Amazing.
[03:22:16.717 --> 03:22:19.178]  That's why we came to D.C.
[03:22:19.178 --> 03:22:20.339]  to confront the tyrants.
[03:22:32.671 --> 03:22:36.993]  All right, Matt Bracken here, and you've got me for the rest of the hour.
[03:22:36.993 --> 03:22:40.675]  Very powerful watching Michael Flynn Jr.
[03:22:40.675 --> 03:22:55.641]  Can you imagine his father, how hard it must be for a warrior to be gagged like Roger Stone, to be forced by the deep state into the position he's in, where he can't even defend himself.
[03:22:55.641 --> 03:22:57.302]  But the day will come.
[03:22:57.302 --> 03:22:58.963]  All the heroes are going to rise again.
[03:23:00.728 --> 03:23:18.414]  You know, this tyranny that we're seeing in America with heroes like Roger Stone and General Flynn being oppressed by these deep state tyrants, even though theoretically we have the White House, the deep state is so powerful, it just doesn't let go.
[03:23:18.414 --> 03:23:25.736]  But imagine if you lived in Canada and you had a lunatic like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as your president.
[03:23:26.294 --> 03:23:29.275]  That's what they've got in Canada right now.
[03:23:29.275 --> 03:23:32.236]  Canada is becoming a tyranny.
[03:23:32.236 --> 03:23:49.821]  And this segment and the next segment, I'd like to introduce somebody to you and then also introduce a case to you, which sounds unbelievably Orwellian, because like Roger Stone, the principals involved are gagged by the court.
[03:23:49.821 --> 03:23:53.262]  They can be sent to jail for discussing this story.
[03:23:53.262 --> 03:23:55.963]  It's about a father whose young daughter
[03:23:56.730 --> 03:24:19.334]  Was brainwashed by these crazy LGBTQ radicals into thinking momentarily she's a boy and then immediately injected with massive doses of testosterone to the point where this child grew a beard and has a permanently deepened voice and has been sterilized.
[03:24:19.334 --> 03:24:25.235]  So there's the journalist that's covering this story who can't even talk about it in Canada.
[03:24:25.822 --> 03:24:27.484]  Can't write about it in Canada.
[03:24:27.484 --> 03:24:30.447]  Can't link videos that we can see on YouTube.
[03:24:30.447 --> 03:24:32.289]  Can't be seen in Canada.
[03:24:32.289 --> 03:24:40.718]  Her name is Laura Lynn Thompson and I'd like to bring her on and she can actually describe what's going on with this case.
[03:24:40.718 --> 03:24:42.941]  If Laura's there, come on Laura, come on in.
[03:24:42.941 --> 03:24:44.042]  You bet, you bet.
[03:24:44.042 --> 03:24:45.603]  Can you hear me Matt?
[03:24:45.603 --> 03:24:45.824]  Yes.
[03:24:46.724 --> 03:24:47.084]  You hear me?
[03:24:47.084 --> 03:24:47.965]  Okay, great.
[03:24:47.965 --> 03:24:51.486]  Thank you so much for covering this because we can't cover it in Canada.
[03:24:51.486 --> 03:24:57.910]  What they've done is they had a young girl totally brainwashed in school that she can be gender fluid.
[03:24:57.910 --> 03:25:04.453]  Then we had teachers who changed her name without informing
[03:25:05.231 --> 03:25:08.414]  The teachers without informing the parents.
[03:25:08.414 --> 03:25:13.918]  So the parents didn't know until the yearbook came out that their daughter had changed her name.
[03:25:13.918 --> 03:25:17.081]  And then they found out, OK, she's having all of these problems.
[03:25:17.081 --> 03:25:24.748]  There had been some other, you know, concerns for her, you know, growing up, being a teenager, the parents going through a divorce, things like that.
[03:25:25.348 --> 03:25:27.990]  So all of a sudden they say, we got to take her to a doctor.
[03:25:27.990 --> 03:25:32.893]  This doctor says, oh yeah, you are definitely transgender.
[03:25:32.893 --> 03:25:36.095]  Now this young lady had already had a crush on two male teachers.
[03:25:36.095 --> 03:25:38.897]  You know, she kind of had a like a thing.
[03:25:38.897 --> 03:25:41.378]  So she had heterosexual tendencies.
[03:25:41.378 --> 03:25:48.403]  So this Dr. Frankenstein tells this young girl that you are transgender and sends her off to our
[03:25:48.983 --> 03:25:51.224]  British Columbia Children's Hospital.
[03:25:51.224 --> 03:25:54.466]  At British Columbia Children's Hospital, she gets a two-hour visit.
[03:25:54.466 --> 03:26:02.912]  At the end of the two-hour visit, this doctor decides, oh, we're just going to offer her testosterone on the very first visit.
[03:26:02.912 --> 03:26:06.714]  How much do you know about a child on the very first visit?
[03:26:06.714 --> 03:26:10.936]  And by the way, the previous doctor who sent her there said, you know what?
[03:26:10.936 --> 03:26:14.799]  She had heterosexual tendencies, but the thing is, she's gay.
[03:26:14.799 --> 03:26:16.480]  So we're gonna turn her into a boy
[03:26:17.316 --> 03:26:24.878]  And then we're going to, you know, send her off as a male into her, you know, into her future life.
[03:26:24.878 --> 03:26:26.239]  So this is what happened.
[03:26:26.239 --> 03:26:29.080]  Then the father, his heart was broken.
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:31.961]  You know, when you have a child, you agree to something.
[03:26:31.961 --> 03:26:35.402]  You agree to protect that child till the end of days.
[03:26:36.002 --> 03:26:38.104]  And this father's heart was broken.
[03:26:38.104 --> 03:26:40.287]  He started fighting it in the courts.
[03:26:40.287 --> 03:26:41.688]  Do you know what the courts did?
[03:26:41.688 --> 03:26:46.894]  First of all, they assigned a lesbian lawyer named Barbara Finley.
[03:26:46.894 --> 03:26:47.835]  She calls herself this.
[03:26:47.835 --> 03:26:51.078]  She calls herself a fat, ugly lesbian lawyer.
[03:26:51.078 --> 03:26:53.501]  That's her words for herself.
[03:26:53.501 --> 03:26:57.465]  And this lesbian lawyer assumes the case for this young girl.
[03:26:58.329 --> 03:27:07.111]  And she basically has had taken mind control, I would say, and has propelled this case and has acted on her behalf.
[03:27:07.111 --> 03:27:16.514]  They then got a activist judge who is an LGBTQ activist judge, Justice Mazari and Justice Bowden.
[03:27:16.514 --> 03:27:26.136]  Both of them put orders in place that this father could not speak publicly or get this mat, not even privately.
[03:27:26.900 --> 03:27:30.663]  Without threat of being arrested without warrant.
[03:27:30.663 --> 03:27:35.946]  There would be an arrest without warrant if he spoke even privately about this situation.
[03:27:35.946 --> 03:27:48.574]  Not only that he was ordered that if he ever refers to his daughter as a daughter and not a son and not by male pronouns he is guilty of family violence.
[03:27:48.574 --> 03:27:49.215]  This is a
[03:27:50.410 --> 03:27:58.615]  Unbelievable situation where the state has drugged and heading towards mutilation of this young girl.
[03:27:58.615 --> 03:27:59.616]  Her voice is changing.
[03:27:59.616 --> 03:28:01.177]  She's growing a beard.
[03:28:01.177 --> 03:28:02.778]  She's sterile.
[03:28:02.778 --> 03:28:04.599]  How old is she?
[03:28:04.599 --> 03:28:06.661]  She's 15 now.
[03:28:06.661 --> 03:28:06.781]  15.
[03:28:06.781 --> 03:28:07.721]  We don't know anything at 15. 15.
[03:28:09.781 --> 03:28:11.982]  Fifteen is sterilized by the state.
[03:28:11.982 --> 03:28:13.823]  And sterilized by the state.
[03:28:13.823 --> 03:28:20.825]  And our Canadian justice system, our medical professions have committed malpractice in my opinion.
[03:28:20.825 --> 03:28:26.167]  Our educational systems have conspired for parental alienation.
[03:28:26.167 --> 03:28:26.807]  All of it.
[03:28:26.807 --> 03:28:29.448]  So the father had to go very silent.
[03:28:29.448 --> 03:28:31.529]  I'm not even allowed to say his name.
[03:28:31.529 --> 03:28:33.270]  I'm not allowed to say a father's name.
[03:28:34.351 --> 03:28:42.876]  Laura, we're going to be going to a break and we'll come back in a few minutes and pick this story back up, but this is beyond belief.
[03:28:42.876 --> 03:28:46.719]  Do people remember when healthy people were lobotomized?
[03:28:46.719 --> 03:28:48.380]  It's the same thing.
[03:28:48.380 --> 03:28:49.341]  We'll be back in a minute.
[03:28:52.076 --> 03:28:55.098]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:55.098 --> 03:28:58.020]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:29:53.086 --> 03:29:55.807]  There can no longer be any doubt.
[03:29:55.807 --> 03:29:59.809]  This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels.
[03:29:59.809 --> 03:30:01.109]  It's very communicable.
[03:30:01.109 --> 03:30:03.110]  It spreads very, very fast.
[03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:05.091]  It is killing a lot of people.
[03:30:05.091 --> 03:30:08.832]  And the Chinese Communist government has covered up just how bad it is.
[03:30:08.832 --> 03:30:11.754]  And the White House is now openly challenging them.
[03:30:11.754 --> 03:30:14.855]  So are Trump's top scientists, and so is Senator Cotton.
[03:30:15.649 --> 03:30:20.291]  My friends, now is the time to get prepared.
[03:30:20.291 --> 03:30:22.632]  2020 is not a year to play games with.
[03:30:22.632 --> 03:30:26.374]  The globalists are trying to create economic collapse, race riots.
[03:30:26.374 --> 03:30:29.275]  We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here.
[03:30:29.275 --> 03:30:32.817]  That's why listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared.

[03:32:34.846 --> 03:32:38.269]  So when I got it last week, when it came back in, I was so excited.
[03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:40.910]  It's now available at InfoWarstore.com.

[03:32:49.136 --> 03:32:52.218]  So please get your DNA Force Plus today at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:32:56.241 --> 03:32:58.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:15.748 --> 03:33:19.171]  Alright, we're back with Laura Lynn Thompson.
[03:33:19.171 --> 03:33:28.898]  She actually worked for the 700 Club of Canada until she was hounded off of the air.
[03:33:40.512 --> 03:33:43.535]  You know, as an Islamophobe.
[03:33:43.535 --> 03:33:44.836]  No, excuse me.
[03:33:44.836 --> 03:33:45.616]  Another phobe.
[03:33:45.616 --> 03:33:48.699]  I guess a trans-LGBTQ-ophobe.
[03:33:48.699 --> 03:33:49.219]  Yeah.
[03:33:49.219 --> 03:33:50.220]  You know, a traditional woman.
[03:33:50.220 --> 03:33:50.360]  Yeah.
[03:33:53.251 --> 03:34:02.097]  I stood against, you know, here in British Columbia we have dozens and dozens and dozens of transgender indoctrination books from kindergarten to grade five, okay?
[03:34:02.097 --> 03:34:04.098]  Then it gets worse from grade five on.
[03:34:04.098 --> 03:34:07.481]  And so I started saying, listen, do anything you want when you're an adult.
[03:34:07.481 --> 03:34:14.466]  You want to cut your schlong off and you, you know, you want to have mutilating surgery, remove healthy breasts, that's your business when you're an adult.
[03:34:14.466 --> 03:34:16.387]  It's Canada, you know, fly your flag.
[03:34:16.867 --> 03:34:20.571]  But children, children are sacred, children are precious.
[03:34:20.571 --> 03:34:24.815]  And so I began to fight against the indoctrination of children.
[03:34:24.815 --> 03:34:34.644]  And so I was targeted heavily, contacting the CRTC in Canada, the governing body of media, and asking that I would be removed and never be allowed to speak.
[03:34:34.644 --> 03:34:36.986]  I've been called every name in the book, and you know what?
[03:34:36.986 --> 03:34:38.528]  It really doesn't matter.
[03:34:39.609 --> 03:34:47.615]  So now I'm standing for the kids and I'm standing against the establishment and these doctors that are transitioning kids without even a thought of it.
[03:34:47.615 --> 03:34:57.904]  We have a doctor in this case that is transitioning 500 ministry, these are foster kids, Ministry of Children and Family kids, 500 of them.
[03:34:57.904 --> 03:35:04.870]  This is a 7 point something percent of all Ministry of Children and Family kids.
[03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:05.971]  This is huge.
[03:35:06.611 --> 03:35:07.691]  This is sinister.
[03:35:07.691 --> 03:35:08.552]  It's evil.
[03:35:08.552 --> 03:35:11.012]  And we've really had enough.
[03:35:11.012 --> 03:35:13.493]  And so in Canada, we are declaring war on this.
[03:35:13.493 --> 03:35:17.334]  And in this one situation, we stand with this father.
[03:35:17.334 --> 03:35:22.995]  We stand with a father who says, how can you transition my daughter?
[03:35:22.995 --> 03:35:25.556]  She can't get a tattoo without my permission.
[03:35:25.556 --> 03:35:27.156]  She can't drink a glass of wine.
[03:35:27.156 --> 03:35:28.217]  She can't get married.
[03:35:28.217 --> 03:35:29.157]  She can't drive.
[03:35:29.777 --> 03:35:33.798]  How is she making the decision to change to a completely different sex?
[03:35:33.798 --> 03:35:35.539]  And how is that OK?
[03:35:35.539 --> 03:35:37.139]  And so we stand with him.
[03:35:37.139 --> 03:35:42.001]  So when he began speaking, he had a publication ban and he broke his silence.
[03:35:42.001 --> 03:35:44.102]  We have decided to stand with him.
[03:35:44.102 --> 03:35:49.603]  And so I did an interview with him and so did a fellow named Frank Vaughn.
[03:35:49.603 --> 03:35:53.584]  And they told me to take my video down and I did not comply.
[03:35:53.584 --> 03:35:54.725]  I was hauled into court.
[03:35:54.725 --> 03:35:56.365]  Short notice leave.
[03:35:56.365 --> 03:35:58.366]  I was sent one email, you know, be at court.
[03:35:59.006 --> 03:36:02.208]  So, I did do that and the judge said that you have to take it down.
[03:36:02.208 --> 03:36:09.193]  By this time, we found out that, you know, the Federalists and mass resistance and places like this, rare.
[03:36:09.193 --> 03:36:10.454]  Sites from the U.S.
[03:36:10.454 --> 03:36:14.296]  and from Australia and Germany are getting this video.
[03:36:14.296 --> 03:36:16.218]  This story's going wild.
[03:36:16.218 --> 03:36:17.979]  And so, I didn't need to keep my videos up.
[03:36:17.979 --> 03:36:19.500]  So, I said, I'll take them down.
[03:36:19.500 --> 03:36:26.625]  So, but when I didn't take them down fast enough after I left court, it took me a few days because, you know, you're busy and you got a lot of things to do.
[03:36:27.185 --> 03:36:30.770]  When I didn't take it down fast enough, they sent police to my home.
[03:36:30.770 --> 03:36:34.495]  So I wasn't home, then the police called me, can you meet us at the police station?
[03:36:34.495 --> 03:36:37.198]  So I had to go and meet at the police station.
[03:36:37.198 --> 03:36:39.962]  Upon which, the police actually told me the names.
[03:36:41.060 --> 03:36:48.862]  The two names that this daughter has gone by, which I did not previously know the names because the father was very protective of his daughter.
[03:36:48.862 --> 03:36:50.643]  And so I didn't know the names.
[03:36:50.643 --> 03:36:52.223]  And so who told them the names?
[03:36:52.223 --> 03:37:02.166]  This lesbian lawyer, Barbara Finley, who has been, you know, defending this young lady and indoctrinating her further and activating.
[03:37:02.166 --> 03:37:05.447]  This girl has become the activist pawn
[03:37:06.527 --> 03:37:08.528]  And we're sick of it.
[03:37:08.528 --> 03:37:11.270]  If that had happened to any one of us, we would stand.
[03:37:11.270 --> 03:37:16.733]  And so I have to go back to court on March 9th to defend whether I'm in non-compliance.
[03:37:16.733 --> 03:37:18.794]  Perhaps I'm in non-compliance today.
[03:37:18.794 --> 03:37:19.874]  But here's the thing.
[03:37:19.874 --> 03:37:22.776]  Once in a while, you get to a place in life where you must speak.
[03:37:22.776 --> 03:37:27.118]  If you do not speak, then you are complicit to the evil going on in the land.
[03:37:27.118 --> 03:37:27.438]  That's right.
[03:37:27.438 --> 03:37:27.899]  Silence is consent.
[03:37:27.899 --> 03:37:29.399]  And that's where I'm at.
[03:37:29.399 --> 03:37:29.900]  That's right.
[03:37:32.975 --> 03:37:50.685]  I had made a comparison already in my mind of this evil to something that had happened, you know, a century ago up through World War II into the 50s where there was a, you know, younger people may not be familiar with this, a quote-unquote surgical procedure called lobotomy.
[03:37:51.403 --> 03:38:06.450]  Where difficult or quote unquote mentally deficient people, schizophrenic people, they put a wire in through the corner of the eye and drug it around your frontal cortex until you became a vegetable.
[03:38:06.450 --> 03:38:13.713]  This actually happened to one of the Kennedys, Rosemary Kennedy, beautiful young girl.
[03:38:13.713 --> 03:38:17.775]  She'd had a difficult birth and she wasn't going to go to college, you could say.
[03:38:17.775 --> 03:38:20.656]  And she was sort of embarrassing her family.
[03:38:21.195 --> 03:38:32.008]  So the Kennedy patriarchs, Joe Kennedy, had her lobotomized, turned us into somebody who didn't know what day it was, barely knew her name.
[03:38:32.008 --> 03:38:35.552]  And this was at the time considered science.
[03:38:36.966 --> 03:38:38.867]  And it was done to thousands of people.
[03:38:38.867 --> 03:38:41.408]  Other people were forcibly sterilized.
[03:38:41.408 --> 03:38:47.031]  There were judges that said, you know, a hundred years of idiots is enough.
[03:38:47.031 --> 03:38:49.153]  Four generations of idiots is enough.
[03:38:49.153 --> 03:38:53.255]  And just sterilized people deemed mentally deficient.
[03:38:53.255 --> 03:39:04.521]  And up in Canada and in Australia, you're still working through this whole process of what was done to the Aboriginal kids who were drug away from their families
[03:39:05.157 --> 03:39:13.804]  And put into, you know, basically westernizing state brainwashing centers, you could call it, for their own good.
[03:39:13.804 --> 03:39:21.329]  At the time, that was considered a great idea to westernize, you know, the Canadian Aboriginal kids, the first Canadians.
[03:39:21.329 --> 03:39:26.353]  That's now considered a crisis, a disaster, a horrible stain on Canadian history.
[03:39:26.829 --> 03:39:34.052]  And we need to do that with this trans movement, these LGBTQ radical ghouls.
[03:39:34.052 --> 03:39:44.155]  They can brainwash a child to the point where they can just momentarily make a decision to step through a trap door and start taking testosterone.
[03:39:44.155 --> 03:39:47.417]  This is not changing a girl into a boy.
[03:39:47.417 --> 03:39:51.278]  It's mutilating and sterilizing a girl.
[03:39:51.278 --> 03:39:53.419]  She'll always be a girl.
[03:39:53.419 --> 03:39:56.180]  And she's now going to be mutilated, sterilized.
[03:39:57.711 --> 03:40:01.494]  Yes, and it's affecting sexual activity for the rest of their lives.
[03:40:01.494 --> 03:40:04.377]  It's affecting their identity for the rest of their lives.
[03:40:04.377 --> 03:40:07.099]  And this is all being done without parental consent.
[03:40:07.099 --> 03:40:09.942]  We have a 4,500% global increase in referrals to gender clinics.
[03:40:13.425 --> 03:40:14.165]  Hello.
[03:40:14.165 --> 03:40:16.046]  Something is wrong.
[03:40:16.046 --> 03:40:25.771]  And it used to be, you know, when when you and I were young, that there was goth kids and and there was punk rockers, you know, and you could kind of get over that phase and take the earrings out of your nose and all that.
[03:40:25.771 --> 03:40:30.733]  And, you know, you get back to being an adult in this phase, in this social contagion.
[03:40:30.733 --> 03:40:32.754]  A child is forever devastated.
[03:40:32.754 --> 03:40:39.817]  And so while they're this this this ghoulish doctor is telling parents, hey, if you're not getting your drugs fast enough, just
[03:40:40.417 --> 03:40:42.178]  You know, say the suicide word.
[03:40:42.178 --> 03:40:45.059]  If you say suicide, oh, everyone's going to move for you.
[03:40:45.059 --> 03:40:51.242]  But here they are moving a young girl into a position where in just a couple of years she might go, you know what?
[03:40:51.242 --> 03:40:53.102]  That was a really dumb phase.
[03:40:53.102 --> 03:40:54.423]  I don't know what I was thinking.
[03:40:54.423 --> 03:40:55.923]  Now my voice is deep.
[03:40:55.923 --> 03:40:59.685]  I still got a partial girl's body, but I have a beard.
[03:41:02.793 --> 03:41:04.054]  Where we face suicide.
[03:41:04.054 --> 03:41:14.623]  I hope that they turn around, I hope that these victims, because that's what they are, they're child victims, I hope they turn around and sue them and also sue the state for actually fronting for this.
[03:41:14.623 --> 03:41:16.725]  That's sad.
[03:41:16.725 --> 03:41:27.434]  We're going to, we've only got about a minute left, but we're going to follow this up because you have a court date and just the fact that this video is being made, March 9th,
[03:41:28.520 --> 03:41:37.807]  Just the fact that this video is being made and shared and will be spread around in Canada, our good friend in Ottawa and others, you could be in trouble for that.
[03:41:37.807 --> 03:41:38.988]  This is purely Orwellian.
[03:41:38.988 --> 03:41:40.589]  But this story has to be told.
[03:41:40.589 --> 03:41:41.670]  It has to be told, Matt.
[03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:43.111]  And I thank you for telling it.
[03:41:43.111 --> 03:41:44.812]  We have got to get the word out.
[03:41:44.812 --> 03:41:46.593]  Stop mutilating our kids.
[03:41:46.593 --> 03:41:48.334]  We are not going to be silent any longer.
[03:41:48.334 --> 03:41:52.357]  And your link to the residential schools was a good link.
[03:41:52.357 --> 03:41:57.781]  And now the residential schools are taking millions of dollars from the government and this is going to happen in this case as well.
[03:41:59.147 --> 03:42:01.728]  And it's, and I think that it's almost more evil.
[03:42:01.728 --> 03:42:13.871]  How can you, you know, you could say teaching kids English and taking them out of these, you know, fairly hopeless Inuit villages where there was nothing to do and at least giving them an education, there was some benefit.
[03:42:13.871 --> 03:42:18.113]  And then as adults, if they wanted to go back to the, to the aboriginal ways, fine.
[03:42:18.113 --> 03:42:23.214]  But in this case, the children are permanently mutilated and sterilized.
[03:42:23.214 --> 03:42:24.295]  Absolutely.
[03:42:24.295 --> 03:42:25.395]  Thank you for pointing it out.
[03:42:26.263 --> 03:42:28.305]  Yes, we have to get the word out.
[03:42:28.305 --> 03:42:28.725]  Thank you.
[03:42:28.725 --> 03:42:29.545]  We're going to have you.
[03:42:29.545 --> 03:42:33.949]  We're going to have you back on again until this entire case is resolved.
[03:42:33.949 --> 03:42:36.510]  So we're going to a break now.
[03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:37.431]  And when.
[03:42:37.431 --> 03:42:38.612]  Thank you, Laura.
[03:42:38.612 --> 03:42:42.275]  And we'll see you again as the case follows out.
[03:42:42.275 --> 03:42:47.959]  And when we come back, I'm going to talk about the COVID-19 outbreak.
[03:42:47.959 --> 03:42:49.120]  What else?
[03:42:49.120 --> 03:42:50.681]  And that'll take us through the hour.
[03:42:51.781 --> 03:43:00.210]  At the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler had discredited the eugenics and world population control organizations.
[03:43:00.210 --> 03:43:09.360]  They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother, decided to repackage themselves as transhumanist.
[03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:12.883]  Now in the year 2020, to set the precedent that
[03:43:13.644 --> 03:43:19.066]  People can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given rights, you name it.
[03:43:19.066 --> 03:43:26.008]  They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender someone.
[03:43:26.008 --> 03:43:32.990]  So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell what they are.
[03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:40.992]  This is the ultimate Kafkaesque mind control, and there's several big articles up on Infowars.com that break this down.
[03:43:40.992 --> 03:43:49.755]  UK teen fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers, gender, UK mother, spare jail for misgendering trans woman, ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine.
[03:43:51.932 --> 03:43:54.514]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[03:43:54.514 --> 03:44:01.500]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:12.409]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[03:44:12.409 --> 03:44:16.472]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality Vitamin B12.
[03:44:16.472 --> 03:44:19.555]  Taken sublingually under the tongue, it is back in stock.
[03:44:19.735 --> 03:44:20.335]  We're good to go!
[03:44:37.623 --> 03:44:44.348]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[03:44:44.348 --> 03:44:53.614]  And they're both back in stock, 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:53.614 --> 03:44:54.395]  Real stuff, man.
[03:44:54.395 --> 03:44:55.576]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[03:44:55.576 --> 03:45:01.019]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:03.889]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[03:45:03.889 --> 03:45:05.590]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:09.371]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[03:45:09.371 --> 03:45:12.652]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[03:45:12.652 --> 03:45:14.472]  20 different stickers.
[03:45:14.472 --> 03:45:16.092]  Impeach the Democrats.
[03:45:16.092 --> 03:45:17.173]  Save the Second Amendment.
[03:45:17.173 --> 03:45:18.273]  Defend the First Amendment.
[03:45:18.273 --> 03:45:19.593]  Infowars.com.
[03:45:19.593 --> 03:45:21.774]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[03:45:21.774 --> 03:45:26.575]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[03:45:26.575 --> 03:45:28.115]  People say, why are you doing this?
[03:45:28.115 --> 03:45:28.635]  What's happening?
[03:45:28.635 --> 03:45:30.116]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[03:45:30.776 --> 03:45:32.257]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[03:45:32.257 --> 03:45:35.640]  And Dr. Puccini, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[03:45:35.640 --> 03:45:36.580]  It's brilliant.
[03:45:36.580 --> 03:45:43.665]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[03:45:43.665 --> 03:45:46.607]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[03:45:46.607 --> 03:45:49.429]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[03:45:49.429 --> 03:45:52.412]  Silence.
[03:45:52.412 --> 03:45:55.734]  A lot of people ask me the InfoWars secret.
[03:45:55.734 --> 03:45:57.856]  And I'll just tell you, I'm just real.
[03:45:58.874 --> 03:46:03.735]  Now, the problem is, I go back and forth, though, in my mind about where I stand.
[03:46:03.735 --> 03:46:07.396]  I mean, on basic stuff, like the Second Amendment, and family, and God, I'm 100%.
[03:46:07.396 --> 03:46:11.538]  But you get to other issues, I start asking myself questions.
[03:46:11.538 --> 03:46:17.359]  So I'll just tell you, I feel really guilty during the middle of this crisis selling high-quality, storable food.
[03:46:17.359 --> 03:46:25.922]  Even though I was pre-positioned, I'm right, we were right about being man-made, we're right about it being super deadly, we're right about being prepared, it still feels weird to be right.
[03:46:26.687 --> 03:46:27.988]  Isn't that crazy?
[03:46:27.988 --> 03:46:28.769]  But you know what?
[03:46:28.769 --> 03:46:30.170]  I'm getting past that.
[03:46:30.170 --> 03:46:31.771]  We still have storable food.
[03:46:31.771 --> 03:46:32.652]  We have plenty of it.
[03:46:32.652 --> 03:46:35.173]  The problem is the packaging of it and getting it out.
[03:46:35.173 --> 03:46:36.575]  Other competitors don't have it.
[03:46:36.575 --> 03:46:37.355]  They're lying to you.
[03:46:37.355 --> 03:46:42.579]  Get your orders in at infowarrestore.com and you know you're going to get high quality storable food.
[03:46:42.579 --> 03:46:44.240]  But now it's not two weeks.
[03:46:44.240 --> 03:46:45.241]  It's four weeks, folks.
[03:46:45.241 --> 03:46:45.962]  We got the food.
[03:46:45.962 --> 03:46:47.122]  We got to package it.
[03:46:47.122 --> 03:46:51.045]  Get your food today, high quality, and fund the Infowar at infowarrestore.com.
[03:46:55.592 --> 03:47:15.661]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.661 --> 03:47:18.022]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:18.022 --> 03:47:21.864]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:47:28.438 --> 03:47:46.586]  Well, I think that we can mark yesterday, February 26, as day one of a new era in the United States because that's the beginning of community, the community spread, the community transfer of COVID-19, the coronavirus.
[03:47:46.586 --> 03:47:52.389]  And that means we're not talking about people that flew in from China or were brought back from a cruise ship.
[03:47:53.018 --> 03:47:57.400]  These are just ordinary Americans that thought something was wrong.
[03:47:57.400 --> 03:48:04.484]  And when they finally got tested, because we've only tested like under 500 Americans, which is ridiculous.
[03:48:04.484 --> 03:48:08.166]  They test that many, you know, in Korea every hour.
[03:48:08.166 --> 03:48:14.309]  But for some reason, we're not getting the test kits out and not testing widely.
[03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:17.671]  So we've now got community spread.
[03:48:17.671 --> 03:48:20.412]  And we're just a week or so behind Italy.
[03:48:21.161 --> 03:48:26.003]  Maybe we're two weeks behind Iran and two months behind China.
[03:48:26.003 --> 03:48:31.725]  But what we've learned about this COVID-19 is, it's not stoppable at this point.
[03:48:31.725 --> 03:48:35.527]  You know, the horse is out of the barn and it's racing.
[03:48:35.527 --> 03:48:42.930]  Now, I had an insight, maybe it's just me, it's my peculiar mind, the way that I think.
[03:48:42.930 --> 03:48:49.513]  I started looking at COVID-19 as an accidental weapon of mass destruction release.
[03:48:50.307 --> 03:49:08.767]  You know, maybe it originated in the bat cuisine market, and maybe it was released from a Wuhan biohazard facility, an accidental experiment that got loose, infected a scientist who then started spreading it.
[03:49:08.767 --> 03:49:10.989]  Doesn't really matter, but it's out.
[03:49:11.693 --> 03:49:21.721]  And it occurred to me, in my mind, I made a comparison to the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film, Dr. Strangelove.
[03:49:21.721 --> 03:49:40.335]  In that film, one United States Air Force General, Jack D. Ripper, goes crazy and sends his B-52 bomber wing off on a nuclear mission to Russia in a way that they could not be recalled, that it would be impossible to bring them back.
[03:49:41.258 --> 03:49:51.026]  And there's a scene in the war room with George C. Scott playing General Buck Turgidson, who says, look, what's done is done.
[03:49:51.026 --> 03:49:52.588]  We can't bring it back.
[03:49:52.588 --> 03:50:00.774]  But if we're going to have this nuclear war, which it's a shame it started, you know, but we might as well win it.
[03:50:00.774 --> 03:50:01.875]  You know, it's happened.
[03:50:01.875 --> 03:50:02.616]  It's out there.
[03:50:03.075 --> 03:50:04.475]  So let's win it.
[03:50:04.475 --> 03:50:10.116]  And the president, played by Peter Sellers, bald Peter Sellers, says, we don't do that.
[03:50:10.116 --> 03:50:11.537]  America doesn't do that.
[03:50:11.537 --> 03:50:13.957]  We'll never start a war.
[03:50:13.957 --> 03:50:18.078]  But the general says, look, it started.
[03:50:18.078 --> 03:50:21.839]  The crazy General Jack Ripper, he's started it.
[03:50:21.839 --> 03:50:29.660]  So now we have to choose between a future where we lose 20 million or where we lose 150 million.
[03:50:29.660 --> 03:50:32.001]  And it started making me wonder,
[03:50:32.811 --> 03:50:45.115]  Are the Chinese, and not only the Chinese, but the Russian and the American generals, are they now looking at this kind of like that big board in the war room with the bombers heading for Russia?
[03:50:45.115 --> 03:50:48.496]  This weapon of mass destruction is out.
[03:50:48.496 --> 03:50:49.817]  It's a fact.
[03:50:49.817 --> 03:50:59.420]  And one advantage when, you know, in the middle of this, I call it a pandemic war now, in the middle of this pandemic war against the COVID-19,
[03:51:00.911 --> 03:51:04.935]  Every country has advantages and disadvantages.
[03:51:04.935 --> 03:51:09.939]  And a big advantage that China has is, number one, they caught it first.
[03:51:09.939 --> 03:51:11.941]  They released it, they caught it first.
[03:51:11.941 --> 03:51:14.423]  They've had more time to study it.
[03:51:14.423 --> 03:51:20.888]  They've actually come up with some medicines that seem to be somewhat effective.
[03:51:20.888 --> 03:51:27.354]  But they've also got this extremely rigidly, tightly controlled society where they can
[03:51:28.246 --> 03:51:30.408]  Order people into their apartments.
[03:51:30.408 --> 03:51:34.772]  They can even lock their doors, weld them shut.
[03:51:34.772 --> 03:51:44.120]  And then the next week, they can go to that apartment and say, you have to go back to your factory because of the critical need for the products from that factory.
[03:51:44.120 --> 03:51:48.664]  That gives them a level of regimentation that America can never accomplish.
[03:51:50.524 --> 03:51:56.206]  One of the people I watch on YouTube every day is a British doctor named John Campbell.
[03:51:56.206 --> 03:52:02.347]  And this morning he had a video where somebody had sent him an email from a city in China.
[03:52:02.347 --> 03:52:11.030]  And I wrote about this on American Partisan, Chinese COVID-19 quarantine rules.
[03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:17.832]  I also wrote a piece yesterday called, you know, Will China Win the COVID-19 Pandemic War?
[03:52:18.553 --> 03:52:23.095]  So, look at the strength that China has compared to an American city.
[03:52:23.095 --> 03:52:28.118]  Imagine a city like Wuhan, where it's spread out of control.
[03:52:28.118 --> 03:52:29.379]  They just quarantined it.
[03:52:29.379 --> 03:52:33.801]  They'll shoot you if you're trying to leave Wuhan or Hunan province.
[03:52:33.801 --> 03:52:35.362]  They'll shoot you.
[03:52:35.362 --> 03:52:37.262]  They bulldoze the roads.
[03:52:37.262 --> 03:52:42.085]  What's happening in there is probably a death rate, you know, 15 or 20 percent.
[03:52:42.085 --> 03:52:44.146]  That's the uncontrolled death rate.
[03:52:44.540 --> 03:52:55.727]  When people say, oh, don't worry, this COVID only has a 2% death rate, that's if they can take you into an isolation ICU, you know, with a team of surgeons and hazmat.
[03:52:55.727 --> 03:53:07.754]  But once a city, a hospital is overrun, once the bodies are stacked in the halls and that hospital becomes, you know, a non-factor, then the death rate goes up to 10 or 15%.
[03:53:07.754 --> 03:53:13.477]  Can you imagine an American city, once its hospitals are overrun,
[03:53:14.361 --> 03:53:22.625]  Immediately I think there will be looting of supermarkets, the pharmacies will be looted, the gun stores and liquor stores will be looted.
[03:53:22.625 --> 03:53:27.968]  There will be no way to enforce these kind of quarantine rules that they are doing in China.
[03:53:27.968 --> 03:53:30.109]  Let me read you some of these rules.
[03:53:30.109 --> 03:53:34.632]  This was sent to Dr. John Campbell, okay?
[03:53:34.632 --> 03:53:40.815]  His apartment complex was issued small cards with a code that is scanned every time we leave and enter.
[03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:46.271]  No one without this card is permitted entrance into the apartment complex.
[03:53:46.271 --> 03:53:53.053]  Masks are absolutely required at all times and goggles and gloves are strongly encouraged.
[03:53:53.053 --> 03:54:02.175]  You are restricted to leaving the complex to three times a week and then only to buy groceries at one or two designated local stores.
[03:54:02.175 --> 03:54:09.217]  Travel beyond those two supermarkets is discouraged and most other items have to be delivered to the front gate of your complex.
[03:54:10.730 --> 03:54:15.894]  Only delivery drivers on motorbikes are allowed out, and they're given a special pass.
[03:54:15.894 --> 03:54:22.119]  They have to wear gloves, masks, and a helmet with a visor.
[03:54:22.119 --> 03:54:32.488]  At present, the only stores open are grocery and convenience stores with reduced staff and restricted hours, and all other shops are closed.
[03:54:32.488 --> 03:54:34.209]  Imagine, your business is just closed.
[03:54:36.124 --> 03:54:36.985]  Closed!
[03:54:36.985 --> 03:54:43.495]  Movie theaters, coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, etc.
[03:54:43.495 --> 03:54:45.117]  Closed!
[03:54:45.117 --> 03:54:50.385]  All weddings and other ceremonies associated with large groups, cancelled!
[03:54:50.385 --> 03:54:52.608]  The economic effects are crippling!
[03:54:53.797 --> 03:54:57.599]  It says, people in my complex have been confirmed to have the virus.
[03:54:57.599 --> 03:55:07.725]  When this happens, you're given the option to go to a quarantine center or they will put a paper tape over your door and you can stay in your apartment.
[03:55:07.725 --> 03:55:14.509]  The tape is checked daily and if it is torn, you'll be taken to a quarantine center for violating your agreement.
[03:55:14.509 --> 03:55:15.509]  And you know what that means.
[03:55:15.509 --> 03:55:20.412]  It says, this is what you are seeing on YouTube with people being forcibly taken.
[03:55:20.412 --> 03:55:21.953]  They have violated quarantine.
[03:55:23.161 --> 03:55:28.204]  Food and essentials are then brought to you daily and delivered by special staff.
[03:55:28.204 --> 03:55:32.526]  Work and education conducted remotely by the internet.
[03:55:32.526 --> 03:55:36.708]  Masks are in tight supply and can be very expensive.
[03:55:36.708 --> 03:55:39.050]  And streets are empty.
[03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:44.292]  This is not in Wuhan, this is in the city of Chengdu, a city of 16 million.
[03:55:44.292 --> 03:55:46.494]  This is like a typical city in China.
[03:55:46.494 --> 03:55:48.955]  Their economy is at a standstill.
[03:55:49.682 --> 03:55:59.128]  And this is because they're battling to get the infection down to where only under 1% will be dying of this disease.
[03:55:59.128 --> 03:56:02.610]  And they can hope, they think they can stamp it out.
[03:56:02.610 --> 03:56:06.033]  Imagine these conditions in America.
[03:56:06.033 --> 03:56:13.157]  Imagine trying to weld Americans into apartments or telling them they can only leave their house three days a week.
[03:56:13.157 --> 03:56:15.779]  One person per household can leave their house
[03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:20.191]  You know, three days a week to go to a certain supermarket and return home.
[03:56:20.191 --> 03:56:20.891]  That's it.
[03:56:20.891 --> 03:56:22.852]  All other businesses closed.
[03:56:22.852 --> 03:56:25.513]  This country can't do it.
[03:56:25.513 --> 03:56:31.435]  So what I'm thinking, the Chinese don't consider that, the Chinese bosses don't consider this a weakness.
[03:56:31.435 --> 03:56:37.997]  They think their ability to quarantine and stamp out this disease first is a big advantage.
[03:56:37.997 --> 03:56:46.140]  If we have 15% fatality rate because it's uncontrolled and our hospitals are overrun, our society will collapse.
[03:56:47.071 --> 03:56:48.052]  A period.
[03:56:48.052 --> 03:56:54.658]  I mean, it will be Sierra, Tango, Foxtrot, Hits the Fan, you know what I'm talking about.
[03:56:54.658 --> 03:57:09.391]  Now, the only book I've written that's a total, you know, pandemic, SHTF book is this one, where a huge earthquake in the middle of the country takes out the entire infrastructure.
[03:57:09.391 --> 03:57:11.933]  But that's the level of what I think can be coming now.
[03:57:12.896 --> 03:57:16.999]  I think that Trump is absolutely incorrect comparing this to the flu.
[03:57:16.999 --> 03:57:21.722]  It does not have a .1, you know, death rate.
[03:57:21.722 --> 03:57:26.065]  It has a 2% death rate with ICU support.
[03:57:26.065 --> 03:57:29.888]  A 15% death rate when it's uncontrolled.
[03:57:29.888 --> 03:57:32.449]  Our cities will absolutely go berserk.
[03:57:32.449 --> 03:57:35.472]  And that's bringing us into an election.
[03:57:35.472 --> 03:57:37.453]  Imagine that.
[03:57:37.453 --> 03:57:39.234]  Alright, I'll see you next Thursday.
