[00:00.000 --> 00:19.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.400 --> 00:28.180]  Fifty days left, ladies and gentlemen, until one of the most critical elections in world
[00:28.180 --> 00:35.760]  history. You know, 65 women have come public from high school, college, you name it, from
[00:35.760 --> 00:42.440]  the last 36 years for Brett Kavanaugh, and they said he was nothing but a gentleman.
[00:42.440 --> 00:49.120]  Many of them have said they never even saw him drink, that the guy was a complete egghead,
[00:49.120 --> 00:55.200]  a bookworm. But it doesn't matter, we have a Democratic Party operative, an activist,
[00:55.200 --> 01:01.920]  leftist professor, his own students are saying he's vicious, hateful and vindictive. Coming
[01:01.920 --> 01:09.880]  out six weeks ago secretly, when he was first announced, then Diane Feinstein and others
[01:09.880 --> 01:18.200]  sat on it and waited till the one week recess for the vote to roll her out and guess what
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.920]  they did three weeks ago, once she had the Democratic Party operatives with her and once
[01:23.920 --> 01:31.640]  they'd vetted her for three weeks, they decided we better expunge her social media accounts
[01:31.640 --> 01:40.880]  which Paul Joseph Watson has in an article he's done. Very, very, very important information
[01:40.880 --> 01:47.480]  that we're going to get into. The article is titled, Kavanaugh accuser has an anti-Trump
[01:47.480 --> 01:54.320]  leftist who attended Women's March, donated to DNC, and it's a great article by Paul.
[01:54.320 --> 02:00.040]  But quite frankly, we need a new article because what's buried in his article is the most important
[02:00.040 --> 02:07.240]  point. They expunged all of her social media, but Paul Watson got screenshots off of the
[02:07.240 --> 02:14.760]  Google archive. So one of the great writers around here needs to do a whole story on why
[02:14.760 --> 02:21.960]  did Kavanaugh's accuser erase her social media history? Because she's a foaming at the mouth.
[02:21.960 --> 02:30.120]  All sex is rape person. She's a leftist anti-man dingbat who goes to all the George Sorrell's
[02:30.120 --> 02:37.400]  events and wears the little pink, you know what, hats. And it's just incredible. Why
[02:37.400 --> 02:44.200]  get rid of your entire social media history a few weeks after you go to the Democrats
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.160]  and then you guys start cooking up what you're going to say? Why did you go right to the
[02:49.160 --> 02:52.880]  top of the Democratic Party to do all this as a political party operative? Wow, you've
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.240]  really turned into a hero. And then again, let me explain what's happening. Here's the
[02:57.240 --> 03:05.040]  giant elephant in the room or donkey in the room. I've gone through this. I've experienced
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.920]  it with the New York Times, Washington Post, gets my high school annuals, talks to everybody
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.560]  that knew me in college, calls even second, third and fourth cousins, and then offers
[03:15.560 --> 03:24.560]  former employees big cash payments to tell their stories if they've got one. And I've
[03:24.560 --> 03:36.080]  experienced unbelievable 100% fraud. I have experienced people tell lies about me that
[03:36.080 --> 03:42.160]  on my children are absolute, complete frauds. I swear before Jesus Christ, almighty their
[03:42.160 --> 03:46.280]  lies. And by the way, I never do that. You're not really supposed to do that, but I'll do
[03:46.280 --> 03:51.520]  it in this extreme situation, even though I'm God fearing and it hurt to do that because
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.840]  I told the truth, but I don't want to tempt God. But on my children, the things that have
[03:58.840 --> 04:03.160]  been put out there about me and the EEOC and all the rest of it are flagrant lies. I don't
[04:03.160 --> 04:13.480]  wear Nazi tennis shoes. I didn't sit there and telepathically hit on a male employee.
[04:13.480 --> 04:17.960]  I didn't tell a black woman that worked here that I wanted to marry her, anything like
[04:17.960 --> 04:23.280]  that. Anybody that works around here knows that's absolute horseman-er. But these people
[04:23.280 --> 04:31.400]  do it. They do it and they think it's funny to lie. They tell fiction about people trying
[04:31.400 --> 04:36.000]  to destroy their lives. I think it's cute and funny. And who did it to me? Garregos and
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.720]  Garregos, Democratic Party, work directly for Hillary, cooking up this crap. And I know
[04:42.720 --> 04:51.680]  the smell of this, you know what, smells like a pile of donkey crap. And that's what it
[04:51.680 --> 04:57.200]  is, Democratic Party dying, trying to stop us taking control of the Supreme Court to
[04:57.200 --> 05:03.320]  save this country. Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula

[06:19.560 --> 06:41.760]  I have experienced the lies that Brett Kavanaugh is now experiencing. I have seen how the corporate
[06:41.760 --> 06:46.720]  media has nothing but an organized crime syndicate working on the Democratic Party to assassinate
[06:46.720 --> 06:53.360]  truth and destroy lives. You've got a woman from 36 years ago who's a Democratic Party
[06:53.360 --> 06:59.920]  operative and Democrat who goes around at George Soros pussy hat marches. You've got
[06:59.920 --> 07:03.760]  her students saying she's a vindictive, hateful person. And you've got her most importantly
[07:03.760 --> 07:10.800]  expunging her social media. Paul Watson has it detailed on Infowars.com. But instead of
[07:10.800 --> 07:14.920]  just linking to the Google machine, the Google archive, we're going to have a whole other
[07:14.920 --> 07:24.800]  article showing what she tried to cover up. There are 60-plus women that have gone public
[07:24.800 --> 07:30.840]  saying that Brett Kavanaugh treated them with extreme respect and a good person. Some
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.880]  said he never even saw him drink and he was a bookworm egghead, yeah, top of his class
[07:35.880 --> 07:43.920]  at every level. 65 women. But that doesn't matter because let me tell you something.
[07:43.920 --> 07:49.800]  I know how the Democratic Party operates. I know how their systems are deployed. I know
[07:49.800 --> 07:58.360]  how the drag nets are put out. And I have experienced massive drag nets against me to
[07:58.360 --> 08:07.080]  contact everyone who ever knew me or halfway knew me to then offer cash payments for them
[08:07.080 --> 08:14.560]  to then make up outrageous fables about me. Now, this woman has all the telltale signs
[08:14.560 --> 08:20.560]  of doing this for political gain. And if you know how they operate, they go through Democratic
[08:20.560 --> 08:28.680]  Party databases they've got of super activists, professors, operatives like this lady. And
[08:28.680 --> 08:33.680]  then they put out feelers to anyone that they can cross reference that was the same age,
[08:33.680 --> 08:41.160]  lived in the same town as their target. I've gotten calls from dozens of former high school
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.080]  associates who didn't even really know me, may have talked to me, may have been in class
[08:46.080 --> 08:51.760]  with me saying, hey, do you remember me? And I'm like, I barely do. The New York Times,
[08:51.760 --> 08:57.480]  the Washington Post buzzfeed is calling me. And then when I told them nothing but nice
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.800]  stuff, they called back and said, well, we'll do a big profile on you if you tell us something.
[09:01.800 --> 09:07.600]  And then closer associates that actually worked around me, they start threatening them. Well,
[09:07.600 --> 09:10.800]  you're going to be in this piece. It's going to be very damaging to you unless you tell
[09:10.800 --> 09:18.800]  us about how Jones doesn't pay us taxes or pays people under the table. And they're
[09:18.800 --> 09:26.960]  like, what are you talking about? Jones knows he's under amazing scrutiny and pays taxes
[09:26.960 --> 09:33.360]  anyways. But this is what they do. And so I'm telling you, like the sun came up this
[09:33.360 --> 09:43.600]  morning. They have indexed every woman in the town he grew up in. Everybody he went
[09:43.600 --> 09:49.040]  to high school with nearby high schools, you name it. And then they run it through a database
[09:49.040 --> 09:57.240]  of people that are in the Democratic Party and they are getting phone calls one billion
[09:57.240 --> 10:02.840]  percent. And before she ever gets a testify to Congress, you know, that's coming before
[10:02.840 --> 10:12.400]  they try to push this back to the election. It all needs to be subpoenaed. Her email records,
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.120]  her phone records. This is in my view, it's proven that she's a political operative, which
[10:17.120 --> 10:21.240]  she is. And this is being done fraudulently. That needs to be investigated if it is. The
[10:21.240 --> 10:28.120]  sun come up this morning to bears crap in the woods. It's water wet. It's mama sweet.
[10:28.120 --> 10:35.600]  It's milk white. The ostriches stick their head in the sand. Is everything Trump touch
[10:35.600 --> 10:42.680]  turns the solid gold? The point is that just as the sun came up this morning, I figured
[10:42.680 --> 10:48.680]  out and I know because I've experienced it. We've had insiders at the New York Times and
[10:48.680 --> 10:52.640]  others who are just made by the told us how it's working. What office is doing it? They
[10:52.640 --> 11:00.480]  have task forces out against Trump against his family against Kavanaugh. We've all been
[11:00.480 --> 11:07.960]  targeted. And so what they do is they then have law firms and media contact everyone
[11:07.960 --> 11:13.920]  in the database and say, wow, you went to school of Brett Kavanaugh, didn't you? And
[11:13.920 --> 11:20.040]  they lead them. Are you at the school of Alex Jones? I heard he was a pretty bad guy. And
[11:20.040 --> 11:25.840]  if they say, oh, no, he's a great guy, we'll go, well, thanks a lot. Click. Oh, yeah, Brett
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.080]  Kavanaugh. He's terrible. Yeah, yeah, I went to school them. Yeah, you didn't know that?
[11:30.080 --> 11:36.120]  Yeah, it's it's here in the school annual and you were two years younger than him. And
[11:36.120 --> 11:41.440]  you see how that works? See how that works? And then now you're like, yeah, I remember
[11:41.440 --> 11:44.960]  why once I was at a party, we were all drunk and some guys rolled around in bed with me
[11:44.960 --> 11:50.440]  for five seconds. I think that was Kavanaugh. In fact, it was Kavanaugh. I never told anybody
[11:50.440 --> 12:01.160]  that. I did tell my counselor in 2012 that a guy grope me when I was 15 in a party. But
[12:01.160 --> 12:05.840]  now she says it felt like he was going to kill her. Now it's him for sure. And that
[12:05.840 --> 12:08.880]  the fact that they rolled around in a bed for 10 seconds, even if it was him, which
[12:08.880 --> 12:22.280]  it probably isn't, it's he was going to die. You see how this works?
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.000]  You know, the Democrats are calling every woman that grew up in the same town as Kavanaugh
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  and they're contacting with databases of anybody that is a Hillary Clinton loving manhating
[12:33.000 --> 12:40.160]  leftist like this manhating leftist professor who's expunged her social records, covering
[12:40.160 --> 12:45.640]  all this up. They sit on it for six weeks until he's days out from confirmation vote
[12:45.640 --> 12:51.760]  next week. And then they drop this. Ladies and gentlemen, you know, they've contacted
[12:51.760 --> 12:58.520]  a whole slew of women and I know their pattern. They're going to release one lady, let her
[12:58.520 --> 13:05.000]  get hit by the barbed wire, let it be criticized and then boom, release another woman and then
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.840]  another woman. And they're all going to be former Democratic party operatives. They're
[13:11.840 --> 13:20.120]  all going to be the pussyhat wearers. They're all going to be the same very cut. And the
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.760]  key to Congress is getting ahead of this and demanding an investigation into who contacted
[13:25.760 --> 13:34.440]  them and swearing them in under oath and demanding discovery. And they're going to back off real
[13:34.440 --> 13:41.080]  quick as soon as that discovery is demanded. The articles on infowars.com right now, 65
[13:41.080 --> 13:44.640]  women defend Kavanaugh city is a good person to meet allegations. That's getting almost
[13:44.640 --> 13:51.040]  no coverage. What is this one woman who has everything to gain 36 years later? Statue
[13:51.040 --> 13:58.600]  of limitations long ago gone. They're calling an assault saying he rolled around in a bed
[13:58.600 --> 14:05.000]  with her when they were both drunk. Who knows if that's even true. I venture to say it's
[14:05.000 --> 14:15.040]  not true and I venture to add the stories on infowars.com. Why did this woman remove?
[14:15.040 --> 14:22.000]  Why did she take down her social media? That is the big question. That is the point that
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.160]  needs to be pointed out and needs to be hammered. Here's the article. Kavanaugh accuser is an
[14:29.160 --> 14:36.240]  anti Trump leftist who attended women's march donated to DNC attempted to derail nomination
[14:36.240 --> 14:44.360]  is a blatant political ploy. And then it goes on. Ladies and gentlemen, that she has erased
[14:44.360 --> 14:49.240]  her social media presence, but it's too late. And the Democrats said they would never approve
[14:49.240 --> 14:58.480]  Kavanaugh. No matter what, because it's Donald Trump. They were always on record saying that
[14:58.480 --> 15:08.680]  that was the case. And now she's smiling like a Cheshire cat on a Sunday holiday in Alice
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.600]  in Wonderland. It's all funny. And that's how these operatives win. That's the tool they
[15:14.600 --> 15:18.720]  use. And that's why Hollywood began eating itself a few years ago with the Me Too movement
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.320]  to where if you just even get an allegation of something, you have to step down, you have
[15:22.320 --> 15:27.960]  to go away so that when they use it finally on Supreme Court nominees, it would be a precedent
[15:27.960 --> 15:34.320]  that you absolutely go straight to prison. No judge, no jury, just social executioner.
[15:34.320 --> 15:40.200]  And I personally have experienced the dirt machine of the corporate media and these
[15:40.200 --> 15:45.320]  law firms, and it's a tactic they use. And at an intellectual, historical and gut level,
[15:45.320 --> 15:52.400]  I'm telling you this is 100% pure horse manure and a fraud. And Congress should ignore all
[15:52.400 --> 15:57.200]  this. It's a fraud. We have laws, statute of limitations and move forward. This is made
[15:57.200 --> 15:59.560]  up that more fake women are coming forward.

[19:23.000 --> 19:33.000]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down. I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  done. I'm breaking the contract. Well, I wrote the contract last week, and so this is potentially
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run, which is Bible Shield X2, and we've
[19:47.000 --> 19:52.000]  got a good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple months. X2, if you haven't experienced it,
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  go to infowarstore.com. If you have experienced it and are not ready to, I suggest you stop
[19:55.000 --> 20:24.000]  up on it. It's available right now for a limited time at infowarstore.com. It's 25% off right now.
[20:25.000 --> 20:40.000]  Christine Blasey Ford is the first domino to fold. You heard it here first. There will
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  be more women in the next week and a half that come out ahead of the confirmation vote
[20:46.000 --> 20:52.000]  next week. And the Republicans blink and have a bunch of show trial hearings and a bunch
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  of virtue signaling, like different White House officials are now saying, Kavanaugh will
[20:59.000 --> 21:05.000]  not get confirmed, and there will be women coming forward and accusing every nominee
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  that Trump brings forward, period. This is the strategy. This is how they create the
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  snowball effect. The Democrats also, to come after me and Trump and others, we've confirmed
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  it. They've admitted it, media matters a year ago, leaked a document where they battle
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  planet. George Soros funds it. They will run a database of everybody you went to college
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  with, high school with, or worked with. They have databases now, and they have groups that
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  go back at your annuals, get the names, and then run those through if you went to school
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  pre-internet. I know it's happened to me. They then run them through. They then cross-reference
[21:44.000 --> 21:51.000]  that with every name that is now a Democrat, particularly an operative. If you're a professor,
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  if you go to Soros rallies, if you donate to Hillary and the DNC, like Christine Ford did,
[21:57.000 --> 22:04.000]  you talk about how much you hate Trump, you get a phone call. Did Kavanaugh ever hurt you?
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  Did you know you went to school in the same town? And then, my gosh, those forgotten memories,
[22:11.000 --> 22:18.000]  those hidden memories of the UFO, actually beaming her up. There was Kavanaugh, a little
[22:18.000 --> 22:25.000]  gray alien suit on, and he threw her on the bed and grubbed her. I mean, I can say that
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.000]  Kavanaugh raped me. This is 36 years later. It's why we have a statute of limitations.
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.000]  If we had a history of this, or a background of it, like he was Bill Clinton or something,
[22:35.000 --> 22:40.000]  then you could say, okay, maybe this is an issue, but no, this is 36 years ago when they're
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  at school supposedly at a party illegally drinking under the age. Why under the age of 18 do they
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  expunge your record? Because a lot of us do stupid things, but Kavanaugh's friends and
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  others and people that knew him, 65 women have gone public. They said, no, most of them said
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  we never even saw him drink or go to parties. And that's what Bill Mars said last week.
[22:59.000 --> 23:03.000]  He said, this guy doesn't look like he goes to parties. This makes us the Democrats look
[23:03.000 --> 23:11.000]  like that. Because this is the first woman that they contacted that had the memories.
[23:11.000 --> 23:18.000]  And so now she gets to be the big star and help bring down Kavanaugh and save America.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  They even had New York Times op-eds last year saying, it's time to lie to stop Trump. We
[23:22.000 --> 23:31.000]  need to throw all morals to the wayside. And so mark my words, there are more women who
[23:31.000 --> 23:35.000]  are either going to see this in the news and figure out that they went to the same town
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  and the same school, the same areas, Kavanaugh that are going to have the memories, the snowball,
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  the mockingbird effect, but they're not going to need to do that because they're getting
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  contacted just like the sun came up this morning by the Washington Post, the New York Times,
[23:50.000 --> 23:57.000]  Buzzfeed, Think Progress, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, Media Matters. All of
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  them are using data mining and are hounding and calling every woman in that town where
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  Kavanaugh grew up. We'll be going over that here today. So how do you respond to that?
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  You have to data mine, the Republicans have to, legally and lawfully, and they have to
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  contact because a bunch of the women are going to go, yeah, I got calls six weeks ago
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.000]  within days of him being the nominee. And they were really, really pushy, but I remember
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  Brett being a great guy. They've obviously already contacted him. They got 65 women saying
[24:27.000 --> 24:35.000]  he's a real sport, but I guarantee you they've been contacted by the Democrats. They rolled
[24:35.000 --> 24:43.000]  them out. It's game over. Why do you think they want me off air? Nine times out of ten,
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  it is my strategies that end up defeating these people. You think it's fun to have the
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  strategies to beat them? So here's your headline from this live broadcast, the last three
[24:56.000 --> 25:07.000]  segments. They're going to roll more women out to bring down Kavanaugh. This is an organized
[25:07.000 --> 25:16.000]  Democratic Party operation, and this is how you stop it. But again, we're social creatures.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  So the Democrats throw a bunch of their people, hundreds of them overboard, sometimes for cause,
[25:20.000 --> 25:30.000]  sometimes for not overboard until the mere allegation, be 36 years old with no proof,
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  no witnesses. The people that she cites as witnesses that were there said no such thing
[25:34.000 --> 25:40.000]  ever happened. They're flabbergasted, but it doesn't matter because it's causing the
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  snowball and it's the first domino. People aren't going to buy this one, but then within
[25:46.000 --> 25:57.000]  days, other women are going to come forward. And the Republicans will sputter and falter
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  and okay, Kavanaugh is withdrawn even though it's not true. And then the next nominee and
[26:01.000 --> 26:08.000]  the next and the next and the next until it will have to be a bubble boy raised in a bubble
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  in his own little bubble house for his whole life learning law. And when he's 55, 60 years
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  old and he's been in a bubble, telephonically coming into courtrooms. He'll work in courtrooms
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  as a lawyer and then a judge. He'll go to Harvard, but VF from his bubble via the internet.
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.000]  And then one day he will leave the bubble by helicopter and will be flown. No, the bubble
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  will be flown to the Senate and they'll have confirmation hearings, but him in the bubble,
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  he'll have a bubble suit. And then within the bubble suit, he will then be confirmed,
[26:45.000 --> 26:52.000]  but by then the country will be gone because they can always with databases now go find
[26:52.000 --> 27:00.000]  a deranged Trump derangement syndrome, hateful person who will then make up whatever they
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  need to. And of course now her own students coming up next segment are going public saying
[27:08.000 --> 27:16.000]  that she is a horribly vindictive, mean person. That report is up on infowars.com and that
[27:16.000 --> 27:26.000]  she tells the students that she'll do basically whatever it takes. So there you go. That's
[27:26.000 --> 27:33.000]  what this is. That's how these folks are operating. And that's where this is going. So you got
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.000]  to ask yourself, what are you going to do about it to stop it?
[27:39.000 --> 27:47.000]  Now, we're going to break. But first, we're running out of survival shield X2, the purest
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  iodine deep breath crystal source that anybody's been able to find. It's very hard to source
[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  it and I would put over a barrel for the cost of it. So it's been discontinued. We're working
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  on some more suppliers. We hope we get some soon. But this is the last run of survival
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  shield X2 in this formulation. It is amazing. It is incredible. It is dark amber in its
[28:09.000 --> 28:14.000]  form. Then you put it on paper. It turns purple blue because it oxidizes and is the pure deep
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  breath crystal source. It is the good halogen. It is amazing. The bad halogens, the fluoride,
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.000]  what I mean, learn about the iodine conspiracy for yourself. Learn about why they pound you
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  with the bad halogens. Try to keep it from the good halogens. Research IQ and just overall
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  brain function health association with iodine that you must have, by the way, the building
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  block of the body. You must have it. It's at infowarstore.com. It's 25% off right now.

[28:48.000 --> 28:54.000]  thought. So it's going to go back to full price till it sells out. Coming up this Sunday,

[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  We knew it was coming. The whole thing was for me leg. First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that,
[32:09.000 --> 32:16.000]  then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[32:16.000 --> 32:27.000]  And then, voila, two weeks later ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[32:27.000 --> 32:36.000]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[32:36.000 --> 32:46.000]  It's also critical to go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[32:46.000 --> 32:53.000]  But whatever you do, tell folks about infowars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps,
[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info, this is what they don't want you to see.
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[33:27.000 --> 33:53.000]  Well, I thought I'd get a lot of the top lawyers that I really respect on the broadcast today to respond to this whole Kavanaugh fiasco.
[33:53.000 --> 34:01.000]  So we've got Mark Rondaza, who's the First Amendment lawyer and also deals with a lot of these big sexual harassment cases.
[34:01.000 --> 34:09.000]  In fact, he's on the side of prominent women in some of these, including in the Las Vegas win case that's going on right now.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  So he's very prominent in that.
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  So he thinks you've done something wrong to women, he'll actually come after you.
[34:14.000 --> 34:27.000]  And then we've got Tyler Nixon joining us as well. And he is a constitutional lawyer and obviously related to Richard Nixon and good friends with Roger Stone.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  And the reason he's coming on is his comment on this, but also he grew up with the Bidens.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.000]  He lived next door to the Bidens.
[34:35.000 --> 34:38.000]  He bought the property of the Bidens.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.000]  He has done everything with the Bidens.
[34:41.000 --> 34:46.000]  And I mean everything that you would do with people you grow up next door to.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  So wait till you hear about this.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  Since Biden says that we're all these horrible scallywags, the word he is was the dregs of society, Trump supporters.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  And then Larry Klayman, constitutional lawyer, will also be joining us.
[35:01.000 --> 35:09.000]  And then Gavin McGinnis will host the fourth hour from the great folks over at CRTV.
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.000]  People ask, man, you have a lot of CRTV folks on.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  And, you know, they have me on some of their shows.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  I'm glad CRTV is out there.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  I'm really glad Drudge reports out there.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  I'm really glad that Tucker Carlson's out there.
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.000]  I'm really, really, really glad that Matt Drudge is out there because I would already be gone.
[35:30.000 --> 35:36.000]  And I almost don't want to give him that much credit because they'll come after him.
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.000]  But they already know he's got the second biggest website in the world.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  Second biggest website, not news site.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  It's the biggest news site in the world.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  They already know without Drudge, Trump wouldn't have gotten elected.
[35:47.000 --> 35:54.000]  They already know he is invaluably, incalculably important.
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.000]  And all of you are together as well.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  And I've been critical in the fight, all of us together.
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.000]  But Drudge is second only to Trump.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  And I feel good when he's there.
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.000]  When I sit there and, oh, Drudge reports 100 times bigger than M4s.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  Thank God.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  Thank God.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  I mean, I hope CRTV takes over the planet.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  The pro-second amendment, pro-sovereignty, anti-globalist.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  I just, world net daily, daily caller, all of it.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  Other talk show host.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  And, you know, so many so-called conservatives try to get brownie points.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  Like when I had Eric Bollinger, very charming guy in person.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  Always liked him on Fox, except when he lied about me.
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.000]  And he's like, you know, Alex, you're part of that all right.
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  The white supremacist.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  And I'm like, dude, you're putting out Hillary talking points.
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  Of course, he knew full well he was doing it to protect himself.
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  We need to stop acting like chumps.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  There's no half measures here.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  You don't need to come on my show and then get afraid you're going to get attacked for it.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  So you got to add all these provisos and put out Democratic Party talking points.
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  Matt Drudge didn't do that when he came here.
[37:17.000 --> 37:23.000]  Because Matt Drudge is a real man.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.000]  And when I say that, I mean that that's what a man does is they say what they think.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  And they don't sit there and add provisos to try to fit in with everybody else and make sure you don't get attacked.
[37:33.000 --> 37:38.000]  A leader does what's right, regardless of the cost, for the greater good.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  Because it's instinctive and it's what they do.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  You know, people ask me what Trump says when he's called me.
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  And it's what Trump told my wife.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  And it's not about bragging about Alex Jones.
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  But it's about understanding why I tick and how I operate and what I'm trying to do.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  So when you see me being demonized and lied about and cut to pieces sometimes.
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  You don't get demoralized thinking, man, we love Alex and he's really getting hurt.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  I knew where this was going.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  I knew that if I was successful, they'd try to destroy me.
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  It's worth it.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  You know what Trump told my wife when he called her one time, one of the times?
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  He said, let me tell you something.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  And I usually only say this to people that, you know, have won like major medals and stuff.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  And people are tougher than me.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  Because your husband's a real man.
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  You know what he goes through to make this country great again and to bring people together?
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  You know how he gets attacked?
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  Believe me, I've experienced it.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  He's a real man.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  So when he's stressed out or he needs your support, hold on to him.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  Love him and understand that he's not like these other cowards.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  He's not built like other people.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  He's a bulldog.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  He's a real man.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  They had like a 10 minute conversation, him telling her how I'm a real man.
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.000]  And again, because he's a real man, Matt Drudge is a real man.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  I want to be a real man.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  When I go to somebody else's show, even I disagree with them, I don't sit there and go,
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  well, I disagree with you on this and that.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  I just talk about what I believe in.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  And they want to debate me.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  Then I debate it.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  I didn't get Eric Boling on who I like.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  I talked on the phone now, he's a smart guy, very talented.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  I don't go, hey, Eric, let's talk about that sexual harassment, which is a bunch of crap,
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  to get little, oh, like, oh, you're attacking me.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Let me get some points back on you.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  And I'm not taking Eric to the woodshed to be mean to him.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  I'm taking Eric to the woodshed because I'm going to play a key clip of him with the
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  added documentation next segment.
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.000]  I want him to understand the real paradigm of leadership because he's a tough guy,
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.000]  a former professional baseball player, you know, a very successful economist, very successful
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  oil and gas future trader.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  He's a tough guy.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  The point is, is he needs to get mentally tough.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  There you go.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  We're about to air here.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  Just posted info awards.com last night.
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.000]  It's titled, Watch CRTV's Eric Boling Get Blown Away by Trump's 911 comments.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  This is important because it's the truth.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  You need to see it.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  You kept saying, oh, yeah, you don't have a clip of this.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  You don't have a clip of that.
[40:13.000 --> 40:14.000]  I said, well, you know what?
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  I'm going to take what you say here.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  I'm going to put it out.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  But again, I like Eric.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  I'm not putting Eric down for who he is in general.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  It's that behind the scenes, he knows a lot more than he's letting on to.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  And I'm just saying, hey, man, you want to really be successful.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  Go all the way.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Stop caring what people think.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Tell them what you really think.
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  He was teasing me about Vegas, being an inside job and stuff.
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  And I said, dude, multiple witnesses, multiple shooters, hundreds of witnesses, stand-down orders,
[40:49.000 --> 40:52.000]  Islamists' terrorist in the area, on and on and on.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  It's unsolved.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  The guy was going to the Middle East.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  We first broke down.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  He goes, yeah, actually, I already know all that.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  I've been researching.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  I'm going to Vegas to do a big investigation.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  And he started saying more stuff than I knew.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  And I'm like, well, there you go.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  He's teasing me about it being an inside job.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  And then, boom, lays out he knows everything.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  And that's what I'm telling you.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  We just can't sit on this stuff anymore.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  It's got to come out.
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.000]  The Democrats, the globalists, the stuff Biden's been saying about the president.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  He's been saying about you being a drag of society.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  Obama, this stuttering, bumbling mess.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  I saw the boil down, like a three-minute clip that I don't want to subject you to,
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  but it's on infohorses.com.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  You want to see him just stuttering and fumbling and I, I, I, I, I, I stuttering
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  10 times worse than I do.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  Because the teleprompter hasn't loaded yet.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  79 times talks about itself stuttered continually.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  The guy is a joke.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  And these people want to dominate us.
[41:55.000 --> 42:00.000]  So we need to wake up and come together and not listen to the Democratic Party's
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  talking points about me or about Trump or about Tucker Carlson.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  Now, Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy, who are the anointed ones with no viewers
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  or listeners, their retweets are like a hundred retweets,
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  literally high school students have more retweets.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  They've now decided their new target is Tucker Carlson.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  The headline was, what happened to him?
[42:19.000 --> 42:20.000]  And they go, actually nothing.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  He was always a deep racist.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  What?
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  That's all you've got?
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  Well, yeah, the new talking point from the Democratic Party, from Biden,
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  from MSNBC and everything else is, Trump is a Holocaust denier.
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.000]  Yes, yes, he's a Nazi.
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.000]  And there was Biden in the speech talking about, there was the Klan with the
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  burning torches in the night and they're coming to get you unless you vote Democrat.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  And the crowd's laughing.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  He says, shut up, shut up.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  It's real.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  It's scary.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  What is scary is that you passed the laws to put more blacks in prison.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  You're a racist and you, the word is, are in the KKK.

[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[44:35.000 --> 44:41.000]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[44:49.000 --> 44:56.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[44:56.000 --> 45:25.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done,
[45:37.000 --> 45:38.000]  I'm breaking the contract.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  There's Vivalshild X2 and we've got a good supply of it.
[45:48.000 --> 45:49.000]  It'll be gone in a couple of months.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowars.com, if you have experienced it,
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  you know how great it is, I suggest you stock up on it.

[47:03.000 --> 47:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.000 --> 47:26.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[47:26.000 --> 47:29.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  Christine Blasey Ford.
[47:31.000 --> 47:38.000]  I'm going to have three lawyers, three constitutional lawyers,
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  on to look at this coming up in the next hour and a half.
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.000]  We've got big news on the infowars army front.
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  The U-Taking Action and the Information War out there,
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  listeners Low and Shroyer and Gavin McGinnis.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  We're going to get to this key piece of video that's also up on infowars.com
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  that's critical to send everybody you know,
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  because if you don't share the articles and the videos,
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  they win banning us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere else.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  They put a hoax out there that if you share my videos or post them, you'll be banned.
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  And they tried that with a few people and had to back off
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  because Congress is starting hearings, Tucker Carlson covered it.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  If they ban anybody, especially anybody prominent,
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  sharing our info or having us on, believe me,
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.000]  the Judiciary Committee and others are just waiting,
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  like a crocodile with its mouth open.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.000]  Okay, that's why when they ban the walk away Brandon Strock guy for a few days on Facebook,
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.000]  they then reinstated it very quickly because we are so close,
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.000]  50 days out to Trump with executive orders, you name it.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  And you see the drip, drip, drip of insider stuff coming out about Google,
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  being political, lying, suppressing people.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  We're just softening them up and getting them ready before we take action.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  And these little arrogant SOBs and big tech moving to China,
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  not working with the Pentagon, but working with the Chinese military,
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  they have really gone too far. They are crazy.
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.000]  Because they're allied with the Democrats and Mueller and Phil Mudd and all these guys,
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  and they really think they're going to defeat America
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  and get rid of me and get rid of Trump.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  And it's not going to happen.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  See, they think thinking, this is very key what I'm about to say.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  The globalist thinking multi-dimensional is multi-pronged attacks.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  They think an attack that hits on a bunch of fronts
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  and helps them in a bunch of ways is a good attack.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  So they'll get mainstream media and big corporations
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  and the elements of the CIA and universities
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  to all come in and attack free speech and bully conservatives.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's not multi-dimensional. That's multi-faceted, multi-pronged.
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  A multi-dimensional thinker would think next dimension,
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  that's going to anger people and make them mad
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  and only make the strongest continue fighting
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  who will make the leadership actually more resistant.
[49:52.000 --> 49:58.000]  Not what you want is people to become reflexive in giving into it
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  instead of reflexive in resisting.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  So then they start a true resistance paradigm,
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  then you go out a few more moves, whoo!
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  Not too good for me and my body, but good for my children and their children.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  So my spirit says, attack.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  I mean, I'm talking, I'm moving 20, 30, 50 moves ahead
[50:20.000 --> 50:21.000]  and you guys just can't do it.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  You can't stare into the ether and do that.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  You're not in the Trump dimension, you're not in the Jones dimension.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  Now, the reason they're censoring us is they fear you.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  And so here's a little promo piece cut a month ago,
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  back when our app was number one on Apple, infowars.com.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  They then banned it.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  But still on Android, infowars.com.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Even they ban it, you'll still have it,
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  which makes the value of the app incredible.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  So you'll be ambassadors from InfoWars
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  with this piece of banned technology
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  from the information wars of 2018.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  So here's that little promo piece.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  and if you're always on the go like me,
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  then you're not always tied to your computer and TV.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  like War Room with Owen Shroyer, Real News with David Knight,
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  and the Holy Grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones show.
[51:18.000 --> 51:21.000]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  is that every single time we go live,
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  So whether you're in the car or on a run,
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  What are you waiting for? Sound like a...
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  Oh, it's Tim Cook.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  Boy, help too.
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  Oliver Darcy.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  Get the Android app while you still can.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  BuzzFeed hopes you don't.
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  Let's go to a part of this report with Eric Bolling
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  and then cut in the clips proving what I was saying to him about 9-11.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  that some crazy person made of.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  I didn't say I said I do not agree with you
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  that the U.S. government, someone inside the government,
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.000]  had knowledge of the terror attack prior to the attack.
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  Oh, really? All over Twitter yesterday,
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  Mainline left the site, celebrated,
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  said America deserved it.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  Reality winner had a top-secret security clearance
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  and was helping ISIS.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  The average professor at UT down the street
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  There were elements in our government
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  allied with radical Islam
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  that helped them carry out the attack.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  Just like the character covering up New Mexico.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  You can argue whether or not America deserved it or not.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  I don't think America deserved it.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  It wasn't your theory, Alice.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  Your theory was not only did America not deserve it,
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  but the United States government
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  knew about the attack prior to the attack
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  and decided to stand down a very different theory.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  It's not that I'm running away from it.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  It's that the media misrepresent what I say about it.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  is one of the number one threats on the planet,
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  probably number one.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I know that there are criminals in our government,
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  like Brennan, who reportedly converted to a hobbyism.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  to overthrow our allies in Egypt.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  You name it.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  I think that elements let this happen,
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  like PNAC, wrote to let there be an attack
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  to end up taking our liberties away.
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  And I've got FBI was warned about flight schools.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  That's CBS News.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  FBI knew Al-Qaeda polished training in the U.S.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  in order to stand down. ABC News.
[53:36.000 --> 53:39.000]  The State Department lapses aided 9-11 hijackers,
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  and they have the heirlooms of evil.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  Flanked tens of thousands of Al-Qaeda fighters out.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Our military was ordered to do it.
[53:45.000 --> 53:46.000]  I don't blame our military.
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  I was like, oh, yeah, our military.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  No, I love our military.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  My family was whisked out of the United States
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  by President Bush himself
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  right after the 9-11 attack.
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  And they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  That's right.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  When you had the world trade set to go,
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  people were put into planes
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  that were friends, family, girlfriends,
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  and they were put into planes,
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  with the left,
[54:12.000 --> 54:13.000]  and there are people in the government
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  working to protect Islam.
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  They got this imam,
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  and he said to dozens of bombings.
[54:18.000 --> 54:19.000]  After six months,
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  he's been released from British prison next week.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  You said some things that I agree with.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  to the United States, our freedom,
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  maybe even the globe.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  I'll agree with that.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Maybe the left's bigger, though.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.000]  Well, I think the left is a different type of threat,
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  and it's a longer-term threat where radical Islam
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  could kill a lot of people real fast,
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  and the left is going to take a while for them
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  But I think we can deal with a straight-on attack
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  like radical Islam.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  It's the left creeping around.
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  I don't like them, either.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  I'm on board with that.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  Building 7 has already fallen.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  Have you seen that video?
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  No.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  And it's right behind her.
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  I can't hear her.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  Do you want me to play for you?
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  What?
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  And, by the way, Alex,
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  anyone could throw a video,
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  the picture behind it,
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  the news press.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  That could be the issue of the green.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  Well, she's saying Building 7 has fallen.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  They put the story out beforehand.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  You might have heard a few moments ago
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[55:23.000 --> 55:24.000]  And, indeed, it has.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  Jane, what more can you tell us
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  Well, only really what you already know
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  details are very, very sketchy.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  We are getting information now
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  that one of the other buildings,
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  Building 7 in the World Trade Center complex,
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.000]  is on fire and has either collapsed or used collapsing.
[55:41.000 --> 55:44.000]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  It's just pancake.
[55:46.000 --> 55:49.000]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision enclosure.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  too much on television before,
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  when a building was deliberately destroyed
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  by world-class dynamite to map it down.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  Donald Trump is on the line.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  I know him as the man behind lots of real estate in Manhattan.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  And, of course, Donald, I understand
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  you were actually a witness to what happened this morning.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  Well, I have a window that looks directly
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  at the World Trade Center,
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  and I saw this huge explosion.
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  I was with a group of people,
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  and I really couldn't even believe it.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  And even, I think, worse than that,
[56:30.000 --> 56:33.000]  for years I've looked right directly at the building.
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  I'd see the Empire State Building in the foreground
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  and the World Trade Center in the background.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  And now I'm looking at absolutely nothing.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  It's just gone.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  You know, the World Trade Center
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  was always known as a very, very strong building.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place,
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  because that's your foundation.
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  This was an unbelievably powerful building.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  If you know anything about structure,
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  it was one of the first buildings
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  that was built from the outside.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  had such narrow windows,
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  is that in between all the windows,
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  you had the steel on the outside.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  That's why when I first looked,
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  and you had big, heavy I-beams,
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  when I first looked at it,
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  I couldn't believe it,
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  because there was a hole in the steel.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  And this is steel that was,
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  you remember the width of the windows
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  of the World Trade Center, folks.
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  I think, you know, if you were ever up there,
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  they were quite narrow.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane,
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.000]  even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been,
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  how could it possibly go through the steel?
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  I happened to think that they had not only a plane,
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously,
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  because I just can't imagine
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  anything being able to go through that wall.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  Most buildings are built with the steel
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  that's on the inside around the elevators.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  We'll be back with full reports on infowars.com.

[58:49.000 --> 58:52.000]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves,
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  it's just as important to make sure your kids

[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Okay, thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  We're into the second hour broadcasting worldwide.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  First Amendment constitutional lawyer, Mark Rondaza joins us.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  He's also one of my great lawyers.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  And Larry Klayman is popping in constitutional lawyer,
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  one of the few lawyers, the only lawyer to beat the NSA.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  In court, we batten down the hatches here,
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  almost at 3 o'clock here.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  And then we've got Tyler Nixon constitutional lawyer
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  and somebody that actually grew up with Biden's kids,
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  lived next door to him to get into Biden's statements about
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  how were the dregs of society?
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  We support Trump and just some of the mafia tactics
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  they engage in up there in the northeastern corner of the U.S.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  And then we also are going to be having a course.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Gavin McGinnis of CRTV joining us.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Owen Schreuer and a lot more.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  Some stations don't carry this first five.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I like to do it because some do want to carry it.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I didn't call you like CNN would do,
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  who you also report for, do some work for,
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  and say, what's your view before I got you on it?
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  I respect you. You're a smart guy.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  And I know a lot of times you say this,
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  me too, but it can be a fraud,
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  but you also sometimes are on the other side of it.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  So I wanted to get your take on Christine Blasey Ford,
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  this admitted Democratic Party minion and operative
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  who is now, in my view, crawled out from under a rock.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  You know, with this info, right when she hears his name,
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  they sit on it for six weeks.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Turns out she sponge all over social media.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  I think that's very suspicious.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  But you're, when we talk during the break,
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  your view is, hey, I'll be on the Supreme Court.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Why not hear from her?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  That's how I look at it.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  I mean, I had a different view when this was an anonymous note
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  that nobody was coming forward and putting their name to.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  But now that she's put her name to it,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  she said she's willing to testify.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  You know, I don't see any harm in at least hearing from her.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  She should at least have that, you know,
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  that that's enough credibility to me to say
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  that it's worth hearing from.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Now, during those hearings,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  she should be subject to cross-examination.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  People should ask her questions
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  that would either show her to be credible or not.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  But look, we're putting a guy on the Supreme Court.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  I mean, I find it to be a little bit strange
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  that this comes out 36 years later,
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  not when he was nominated to the DC Circuit,
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  not any time before that.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  But those are issues that go to her credibility
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  while at the hearing.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  So I agree with the people on the left who are saying
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  this is at least worth investigating
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  to know who we're putting on the court.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Well, I love the point that she says they're stumbling drunk.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  And then she never tells anybody about this at this point.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  You're a minor, you're stumbling drunk.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Even if it's true, people do stupid things.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  And so I just, there's a statute of limitations for a reason.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  It's not like there's some long train of abuses by Kavanaugh.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  He's got 65 women saying he was nothing but a gentleman.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Why don't they get hurt?
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  You know what?
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  How about they all get hurt and then she gets hurt too?
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Well, I mean, as far as if you're trying to evaluate
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  the credibility of a witness, you know,
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  if I could, you can go out and assault one person
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  and then I can get every single other woman on the planet
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  that he didn't assault who says he seems perfectly nice to me.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  I think in this situation, it is worth hearing from her.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  I want to know because if he's not telling the truth,
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  you know, let's just look at this guy objectively.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  When I looked at him, you know,
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  I only evaluate judges as far as how I think
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  they're going to rule on First Amendment issues.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  I looked at him and thought this guy's probably going
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  to be good for the First Amendment.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  But you also want a judge who is going to respect the rule of law.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  And if he's lied under oath, you know,
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  he's kind of in checkmate here because either she's telling
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  the truth or he's telling the truth right now.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  He doesn't have any wiggle room.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  He is categorically denied this habit.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  So let's let's put this out there because I also don't want to
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  have if he goes on the court, do you really want to have him
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  have this cloud of there was an accusation and nobody.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  No, I understand.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Just like Anita Hill blew up in her own face.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  I mean, I see your point.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  My issue is you've been behind the scenes with me.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  I've experienced the New York Times and Washington Post
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  and law firms literally going around paying people to lie about.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  And so I personally have experienced people saying I'm
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  wearing Nazi tennis shoes, you know, and I'm running around
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  the office with my ding dong hanging out.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  So, you know, when you've been exposed to something,
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  is it true?
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  You get a little bit.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  health issue.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters,
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet,
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  shower and sink in your home.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  for your whole house with one system.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  The pro pure whole house water filtration system is an advanced
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  four stage compact filtration system that will provide
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  water filtration for your entire home,
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain,
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  water supply and away from you and your family.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction,
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  all over your home.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Head to infowarstore.com and whether it's your first water
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  pro pure whole house filtration system today.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  info war.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  It is Monday, the 17th day already of September 2018,
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  only 50 days out from the most historic election in world
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  history.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  And I respect Mark Rundhousie, constitutional lawyer.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  He's also been involved in some lawsuits against the wind
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  group, all that.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  He's on the Democrat and Republican side.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  He's just somebody that basically takes cases as they
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  come.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  So I thought, get him on, get Larry claiming on,
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  get Tyler Nixon, all lawyers I respect.
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  Don't call him beforehand and ask their opinion.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  Get him on to get it raw on air.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  Since we just got joined by a bunch of stations,
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  let me give you my view.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  Stories are up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  Kavanaugh accuser is an anti-Trump leftist who attended
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  women's marches, donated a DNC.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Hillary produced pussy hats, you know, did all this.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Her students say she's really mean, very vindictive.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  We've got their comments going back years that she uses a
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  piece of work.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  65 women defend Kavanaugh is a good person of an
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  allegation.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  She says he was 17.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  She was 15.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  We're at a house party, her words, falling down drunk.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  I ever heard in the Washington Post original article,
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  falling down drunk, stumbling drunks, the word,
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  and that he fell on her on a bed and they rolled around.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  She says, I thought I was going to die.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  That's been added.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  And they're calling it sexual assault.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  So even if this happened, they're minors, they're drunk,
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  36 years later.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  It's why you have a statute of limitations.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  My issue with this is that you got the Democrats saying,
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  we're not going to confirm Kavanaugh, no matter what he does.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Now, Rondaza had first had looked at him and seen so as
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  close as he'd like him.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Then look deeper, said, no, the guy's pro, first amendment.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  My issue is, and I'm predicting, because I know how they run
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  these databases.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  They contacted almost everyone I know in college or high
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  school, the New York Times, Washington Post.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  They had databases.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  They went through school annuals and they finally found
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  people at least that had worked in and around me to
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  make stuff up for cash money.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  So maybe a little prejudice when you haven't done the
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  things they're saying and they've got a hit piece out
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  against you and a paid for vendetta by George Soros
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  literally that you don't buy this.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  But why'd she wait till a week before the confirmation vote?
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  Why did she expunge her social media?
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  I think Rondaza's point will be, well, hear it out.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  It'll make for great TV anyways.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  And these are the points you raised.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  But how do we ask her in the committee?
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Were you contacted by Democrats?
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Because you were found in a database to have been in the
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  same town as him and near the same age.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  Because I guarantee you, because I know this is going on,
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  just like the Republicans could find 65 women that knew him.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  This is a dragnet effect.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  So that's what I'm pointing out.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  That's why we have Statutes of Limitation.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Mark Rondaza, Rondaza group, thanks for joining us.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, why is she coming forward today,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  36 years later?
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  I mean, look, there are people who may have sexual assault issues
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  who just decide it's not worth coming forward at the time.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  It's not worth it years later.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  It would have seemed maybe worth it for her to come forward
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  when he got nominated to the DC circuit.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  But, you know, perhaps she, I mean, let's just take this from
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  the perspective that she's telling the truth.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Just whatever you believe, take it from that perspective
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  just for the sake of argument.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  If she's telling the truth, I could see her not wanting to
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  bother to come forward until something so momentous
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  as he's going to be on the Supreme Court.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  And you know what?
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  Maybe it's time for me to set aside my own personal.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  But she's a Hillary worshiping pussy hat wearing anti-Trump
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  zealots.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  So that gives her a real motive to lie.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  That does, you know, that is something that if there's a hearing
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  and this is subject to a hearing, she's subject to some
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  cross-examination because she has said she'll testify now
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  from what I've read.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Those are questions I think people ought to ask her.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  I mean, would it be much more credible if she was a volunteer
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  in the Trump campaign?
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  It would be.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  You know, there are many circumstantial motivations here
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  that you could attribute to why she's coming forward now
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  in this way in a story that sounds to me to be completely
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  unverifiable except for the fact that, hey, there was another
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  guy there, she's saying.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  So maybe this guy comes forward and says something that tips
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  the scales.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  You know, so I just think from my perspective, I like to see
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  the process play out.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  This is probably on the very, very far edge of what I would
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  say is worth having hearings on.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  But before we put somebody, you know, Brett Kavanaugh is a
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  young man.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  He's going to be on that court for the rest of his life.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  And I think this is at least worth exploring.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  When I was when I was 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, I've had
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  women plenty of times grab me and throw me on bed and jump on
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  top of me.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  I mean, Mark, if you know that women throw you on bed and
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  jump on top of you.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  Right.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Look, I don't know.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  Were you sexually?
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Well, let's be honest.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  I mean, we see women jumping on top Elvis on stage.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And they're calling this rape.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  They're calling it sexual assault.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Even in her statement, they're falling down drunk.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  He rolls around on top of her.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Now she thought she was going to die.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Even if it's true, it's just the timing of this.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  The Democrats said they were never going to let him get in.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  And then magically they sit on it for six weeks and then release
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  it right beforehand.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Yeah, look, I wouldn't be surprised if they waited to have
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  this timing, you know, be politically expedient for them
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  at a good time to delay the hearing.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  But hey, that's politics.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Have you had women grab you and throw you on a bed and jump
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  on top of you?
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Me?
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Yeah.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Well, yes, and I enjoyed it.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  But you know, that's a little, I think it's different.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  No, no, I agree.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  But the leftists say it's not.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  But in mammal rituals, if the female rushes the male, he'll
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  just kind of run away if he doesn't like it.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  But it's the other way around.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  All I'm saying is I'm not a guy that's ever forced sex on
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  anybody.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  And I understand that some guys are into this.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  I want to break their nose.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Kavanaugh, just like Bill Martin secretly said, the guy, I
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  don't believe he was ever at a party.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  A lot of these women say Kavanaugh doesn't even drink.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  People that knew him in high school said he was an egghead
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  bookworm.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  And now he's at parties jumping on top women.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  And then, oh, the witnesses, she say, were there.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Go, this never even happened.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Look, this may be completely made up.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  It may be completely factual.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  But I want to see her on the stand being cross-examined by
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  the best in the Senate that wants to defend Kavanaugh's
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  reputation, the best in the Senate that wants to tear it down.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  That's what confronting your accuser is about.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  There's no prosecution here.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Yes, it's past the statute of limitations.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  But if this is something that he did, even when he was 16
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  years old, I could see them figuring out, yeah, he did it.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And, you know, it being 30-something years ago, he didn't
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  even remember it, so he wasn't lying.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  And then people still saying, all right, he's a different
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  guy now.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  No, I hear you're saying now they brought it out.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  If he doesn't meet it head-on, it becomes who he is,
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  his legacy, his destiny, instead of like Clarence Thomas
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  meeting it head-on.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, Clarence Thomas did meet it head-on,
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  right?
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And in those hearings, it was...
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  But he at least worked with her.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And it was 10 years before.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  I mean, if they went back 35 years with me, I don't know,
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  35 years with me, I never threw women on beds.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  But, I mean, people could definitely take stories I was
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  involved in and spin them into something.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  Sure they could.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  And I'm sure if we go back far enough and say, you know,
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  there was a night that you were completely wasted, I could
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  make something up that you did.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  And you could say, well, I don't remember that because
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  I was wasted.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  I mean, there's...
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  I remember a few times in high school, I was pretty much
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  reformed by college, waking up the morning face down in
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  a hallway.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  So...
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Sure.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Oh, yeah, look, hey, I have had my nights where there has
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  been a...
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  The only reason I know what happened the night before is
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  because somebody saw it and said, what the hell were you
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  thinking?
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  You know, I've not been an angel.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  But this situation, we've got a Supreme Court justice, I'm
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  at least comfortable saying, let's let this play out.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  I'm skeptical, you know, because there are...
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  She does have many, many motivations.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  No, I think that's very judicious and fair enough.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Here's my gut level.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  They've contacted with databases that Democrats have in the
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  big media, corporate media, everybody.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  And they've got other women that want to stop Trump wound up
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  and ready.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  I believe this is all scripted, wound up.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  And I think it's...
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  Whether it happened or not or something, whether it was a drunk
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  guy, she thinks it's cabin on.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Whatever happened, this is political, it's wound up.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  And I believe they're going to start dropping dominoes.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  And then every other nominee Trump has, women are going to
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  come out and say that, you know, that aliens abducted him
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  and Trump was on the spaceship and had a big probe and...
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  You know, it does seem to be, you know, look, it's
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  classic Democrat playbook, but that doesn't mean she's lying.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  But it also doesn't mean she's telling the truth.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  The process is going to have to...
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  I think we're, you know, we're making a bad decision if she
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  doesn't at least get called up to testify.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Listen, they better not treat her with kid gloves.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I want to know the Democrats' contact her.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  I want to see the information.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  There's not time.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  an affordable insurance plan, keeping your doctor, or being
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  able to afford needed prescriptions, navigating the
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  healthcare system has become a challenge.

[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  thieves ransacked the place.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  David Hall, Diamond Gusset Team Company.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  Hi, I'm David Hall.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  I'm David Hall.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  Hi, I'm David Hall.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Here's Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  I'm David Hall.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  I'm David Hall.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  Hi, I'm David Hall.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Here's Life Daily Digestive Pack
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:16.000] ari.org.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  How many policemen you have on the right side?
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:28.360]  But isn't that why we have a statute of limitations is I mean, this is 36 years ago and then you
[1:21:28.360 --> 1:21:33.760]  even got Sean Penn, you even got Anthony Robbins, who's a Democrat.
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:37.920]  You even got Bill Maher saying this stinks to high heaven.
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:39.800]  Why do you think they're saying that?
[1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:43.560]  Statutes of limitations only apply to criminal prosecution doesn't apply to the court of
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:47.040]  public opinion doesn't apply to nominations for the Supreme Court.
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:52.040]  We can go back to, you know, when the guy was eight, if we want to look at his character
[1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:53.040]  back then.
[1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:55.040]  I'm going to say Brett Kavanaugh, right, me?
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:57.040]  Look, the Senate, please be careful.
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:21:58.760]  I don't want to defend you in another case.
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:21:59.760]  It's a joke.
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:03.400]  I don't think Brett Kavanaugh really, it's called, that's the left suing everybody for
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:04.400]  free speech.
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:09.680]  But look, Brett Kavanaugh is going to sue me now, that's clearly a joke.
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:13.360]  There are any numbers and possibilities here, okay, for this story.
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:17.160]  Yes, there are things that make me suspicious of this story.
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:19.680]  There are other things that I got to ask myself.
[1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:20.960]  Why would she come up with this?
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.760]  Why would she subject herself to this and say there was a third guy there?
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:30.960]  You know, why not just, if you're going to make up a story, make up a story with no witnesses,
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:31.960]  right?
[1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:36.480]  But now this guy, this third party that was supposedly there says it didn't happen.
[1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:42.200]  And there's a lot of unanswered questions here and I just think that you can't shove
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:49.480]  a candidate down the American people's throat with a purely partisan vote and not take this
[1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:50.480]  thing seriously.
[1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:56.080]  At least half of the people in the country, if not more, are going to want to know what
[1:22:56.080 --> 1:22:57.080]  the decision is here.
[1:22:57.080 --> 1:23:05.040]  And hell, they might figure out, yes, it happened, and it's not made up, but it doesn't matter.
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:07.080]  That might be a decision that we come to.
[1:23:07.080 --> 1:23:11.000]  But when the Senate makes this decision, the Senate has to have, you know, the president
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:15.640]  picks the nominee, then has the advice and consent of the Senate.
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:17.880]  I want a fully informed Senate.
[1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:25.240]  Now, I do not want to see every single candidate have people go back and say, you know, did
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:28.840]  they cheat in, you show me yours, show your mind in kindergarten?
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:35.720]  But this is a realist, at least a serious accusation, even if it's so old that it would
[1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:38.880]  never support any kind of a prosecution or a lawsuit.
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:40.680]  It's worth listening to her.
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:48.880]  Well, expanding on this, do you gut level think now there'll be the bandwagon effect
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.240]  and more women will come out?
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:55.960]  Because we know that in any big case, you get crazies, whether the case is real or not,
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:58.240]  or imagined, that start jumping on the bandwagon.
[1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:03.720]  Oh, of course, I mean, that's, that's been, look, that's been how politics has been for
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:09.600]  decades that anybody, you try to dig up anything you can find on anyone as far back as you
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:10.600]  can go.
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:16.680]  I mean, it is somewhat telling to me, if, if let's just presume this happened exactly
[1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:19.440]  the way she says it happened.
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:25.520]  If that's the last time Brett Kavanaugh did anything worthy of being accused, you know,
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:30.920]  worthy of being grilled on, good God, my, my problem with him is he's too squeaky clean.
[1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:34.880]  I want somebody with a little grit on the court for once, you know.
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.800]  I hear you will certainly make for high ratings on the radio to cover, you know, next week
[1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:42.840]  if she's in there and hearings, do you agree with Senator Graham that they're going to
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:46.360]  do this thing to have the hearings immediately and not just let this drag out?
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:48.360]  Yeah, let's hear it now.
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:53.160]  Let Collard, she's, she's said through her lawyer that she's willing to testify.
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:59.560]  And should they put Kavanaugh and her together sitting at two different desk?
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:02.400]  Because I think Kavanaugh is people to face as accuser.
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:05.600]  I'm so sick of how they have hearings about me and lie about what I've said in Congress
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:08.120]  that I can't even be in the hearing.
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.440]  I think I'd be great, but you know, what, what are they all doing today?
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:15.600]  They can take a day off from running around trying to grub campaign contributions and
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:16.600]  have a hearing.
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:17.600]  So let's do it.
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:18.600]  Good.
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:19.600]  Let's do it then.
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:20.600]  Let's raise this.
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:24.480]  California professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh, speaks out about her allegation
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:26.760]  of sexual assault.
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:31.840]  And they're saying because her husband recalls 2012, where they were in couples therapy,
[1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:36.160]  they did not save the name of the person, but said that someone had jumped on top of
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.080]  her when she was a teenager at a party.
[1:25:39.080 --> 1:25:40.080]  So wow.
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:45.440]  I mean, this is just, wow, didn't name the name, but boy, now that's the total proof.
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:47.960]  Told a psychologist, but I guess that's not in the psychologist notes.
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:50.360]  So now it's just the husband.
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:53.760]  Well, you know, again, maybe it's true.
[1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:58.200]  But how do you witness, don't most courts disregard a spouse's testimony compared to
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:25:59.200]  other testimony?
[1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:04.320]  Oh, look, if this was in court, it would be over before it started, there'd be like the
[1:26:04.320 --> 1:26:07.440]  laws of physics would have to bend for this thing to go forward anywhere.
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:12.440]  But that's not what this is, you know, the Senate can make it, senators can vote based
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.400]  on whatever they want.
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:19.800]  And you know, I'm more interested to know if Kavanaugh was lying or not than as to
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:20.800]  whether it happened.
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:25.320]  Kavanaugh had said, you know, and he might not remember it, it may have happened exactly
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:28.560]  the way she says, and he doesn't remember it because it's from so long ago or he was
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.560]  so drunk or whatnot.
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:37.160]  But you know, I would like to see this played out because if he was lying while under oath,
[1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:43.080]  you know, how does he feels that the friend that was there is trying to talk to the news
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:46.080]  saying she's quoted me, none of this even happened.
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:49.520]  So here is Kavanaugh classmate says assault didn't happen.
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:53.880]  We'll talk about that in a moment, but first here's Sean Penn on the whole me too movement.
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:27:03.080]  Yes, largely shouldered by a kind of a receptacle of the salacious, you mean a receptacle of
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:04.080]  the salacious.
[1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:06.840]  Well, we don't know what's a factor in many of the cases.
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:13.280]  Salacious is as soon as you you call something a movement that is really a series of many
[1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:20.720]  individual accusers, victims, accusations, many some of which are unfounded, the spirit
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.480]  of much of what has been the me too movement is to divide men and women.
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:26.480]  And that's totally true.
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:30.800]  And that's the whole plan of the globalist and they want to lead the war between men
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:31.800]  and women.
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:33.000]  I mean, that's really what's going on here.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:38.720]  Whether this woman is real or not, I have my right to say the thing stinks to high heaven.
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:39.720]  And you do.
[1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:45.240]  And you know, I think that unless she's prepared, you know, she is prepared to testify.
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:47.080]  Let's make her do it.
[1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:49.800]  Or, you know, indulge her in doing it.
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:52.000]  Let her be heard.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:57.080]  Because at this point, this is all we got on the guy, this and some, you know, nebulous
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:02.320]  story about baseball tickets, you know, other than that, let's sit him down, grill him.
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:05.800]  Well, I demand that her phone records, because she's making public accusations and everything
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:10.000]  we release, that she hasn't been contacted by the Democrats before this even happened.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.040]  And you know, isn't cooking this up because we know she's being handled by the Democrats
[1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:14.040]  now.
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:18.320]  Look, if she was contacted by the Democrats before this came out, I don't think that
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:19.320]  changes anything.
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:21.360]  I mean, I would not be surprised.
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:22.840]  How does that change anything?
[1:28:22.840 --> 1:28:28.400]  She's, they're looking, they are desperately looking for any way to derail this justice
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:34.560]  because they have this partisan belief that he will be the worst thing to ever happen
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:35.560]  to democracy.
[1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.400]  Well, you know, I think they're overblowing it.
[1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:40.200]  I think they're hysterical about it.
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:42.400]  But this is what they're going to do.
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:46.320]  All right, Mark, I think it's blowing up in their face, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:47.320]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:28:47.320 --> 1:28:48.320]  Talk again real soon.
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:50.560]  I look forward to hearing these hearings, man.
[1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:51.560]  What a circus.
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:57.920]  I'm going to have hearings about a dinosaur raped me five million years ago.
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:58.920]  Hear that.
[1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:04.360]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.320]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:10.800]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:49.240]  the Infowar.
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:34:04.640]  It's the first chip identification devices implanted into their body.
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:22.320]  We're going to get into this whole cabinet on a situation.
[1:34:22.320 --> 1:34:26.800]  I have three daughters, and I know there are men that abuse women, and I think we should
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:31.760]  look at any time somebody makes an accusation, but if it's 36 years old and the person is
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:36.160]  a Democratic Party operative and they've expunged all of their social media networks and their
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:42.520]  Stanford records and then all we find is Democrat connections and they hold it to the 11th hour
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:49.200]  and then you've got all this going on, I think it stinks to the highest of the heavens.
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:53.480]  And I think more women, because I don't know how the Democrats contact all these databases
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:56.120]  on this holy jihad, I think this is the beginning.
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:34:59.520]  I think more women are going to come out, and then no matter what nominee you bring
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:00.520]  forward, it's going to happen.
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:01.520]  It's the tactic.
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:02.800]  That's what I think is going on.
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:04.880]  Does she have false memories?
[1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:05.880]  Is she confused?
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:06.880]  Whatever.
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:07.880]  Statue limitations.
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:13.480]  36 years ago, all 65 women saying cabinet as a gentleman, they don't count.
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:15.600]  Just the one Democrat.
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:19.520]  And her eyewitness says it didn't even happen.
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:22.720]  That's not getting any coverage, though.
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:24.280]  We're going to go to Larry Klamman here in just a moment.

[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:17.720]  But I've had X2, the deep-earth, purest iodine out there for over five years.
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:22.120]  We had a great seaweed base when it wasn't as strong, and they used sabotage and stuff
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:23.720]  to get the company out to sell to us.
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:26.760]  You've seen what we've been through over the years, this is nothing new.
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:31.120]  So then we got a DEA-sourced company with an oil company that had deep-earth crystals
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:34.440]  that was used in pharmaceuticals, but it's legal to sell to you, as long as it's put
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:40.720]  into the palm oil, and it's pure iodine, the good halogen.
[1:36:40.720 --> 1:36:44.360]  This is the last run because it's hard to source, it's hard to get, they put me over
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.240]  a barrel for the cost, we're trying to source some more.
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:51.640]  If there is a new X2, it'll have a new name, and it'll be better, or it'll be just as
[1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:54.160]  good as this one, but there's no contract now.
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:37:01.680]  This is the end of X2, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or triple-A-253-3139, and we've got a lot
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:06.960]  of other great products there on the site as well.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:12.400]  Supermell vitality, superfumell vitality is cold press known organic herbs to boost energy
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:13.960]  stamina and libido.
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:18.400]  Very expensive to make, it's like wine, it's aged, it's cold press, so it takes four or
[1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:25.640]  five times the herbs to produce it, then powdered herbs, and that is discontinued as well.
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:29.840]  If we redo it, it'll be reformulated, it's just that it's so expensive to make these
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:34.640]  because they're so proprietary that we can't do it anymore, and we're working to lower
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:35.640]  the prices.
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:41.720]  So, we have supermell vitality, the last run, 50% off, superfumell vitality, 50% off, it's
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:45.680]  excellent, it's amazing, I hope it comes back, but right now, this looks like it's the last
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:47.120]  run of that.
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.800]  And those specials have to end, they have to end this weekend because we're getting close
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:56.760]  to being sold out of more than half the X2 and the supermell, so we're going to sell
[1:37:56.760 --> 1:38:03.200]  out the rest at the regular price instead of discounted, superfumell 50%, X2, 25%, those
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:06.200]  specials are going to end this weekend, thank you all for your support.
[1:38:06.200 --> 1:38:10.660]  Now, joining us, Larry Klayman, and again, when I get these guests on, these are respected
[1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:15.520]  lawyers, had Mark Rondaza on earlier, he's saying, hey, may I happen, you know, a drunk
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:17.400]  party, whatever, hear it out.
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:21.280]  He says it's on the edge of plausibility, but whatever, maybe it did happen.
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:24.040]  My thing is, why is she expunging her records?
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:26.360]  New article, just went up on infowars.com.
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:30.560]  Cabana, accuser, erased social media history before coming forward, according to reports,
[1:38:30.560 --> 1:38:35.240]  we have shots of what she got rid of, and shots of what she was able to conceal.
[1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:37.600]  So, will any of this get called?
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:38.600]  What's really happening?
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:40.200]  Larry Klayman, thanks for joining us.
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:43.600]  Good to see you, comrade, good to see Alex.
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  Getting crazy.
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:50.960]  Yeah, now it's insane, and of course, all of this looks very contrived at the last minute,
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:55.400]  36 years old, as you pointed out, but you and I know very well, the Republican Party
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:39:00.440]  in Washington, D.C., the establishment, and they usually run for the exits in situations
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:05.320]  like this, and that's what makes this so uncertain, because now there's calls to bring this woman
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:09.440]  in front of Congress, in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it's going to be another
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:14.520]  dog and pony show, the allegations, however suspect, are worse than with regard to Clarence
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:15.520]  Thomas years ago.
[1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:18.480]  By the way, I love Clarence Thomas, as I do you.
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:25.040]  He stands for principle, but I think his chances of confirmation at this point, because of
[1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:29.760]  the reality, if they ran this thing through the Republicans, they believe they're going
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:34.680]  to lose a lot of female votes in the midterm election, and I think there's a good chance
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:38.960]  they run away from Judge Cabana at this point, because they haven't been the most courageous
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.080]  people to put it diplomatically in the last many years, which is why they're in the verge
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:46.160]  of losing control of Congress, as we speak.
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:52.320]  So this is very serious, even though the allegations are suspect, and we live in this world today,
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:56.440]  it's like the Salem witch trials, there are legitimate cases, like you said, Alex, with
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:39:59.720]  regard to sexual harassment and abuse.
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:03.640]  I didn't have some clients that I'm representing in that regard, but there are a lot that are
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.920]  simply made up, and the man is presumed guilty until proven innocent.
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:12.200]  So this is a very serious situation, and I think if Trump does not get this nomination
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:17.120]  through this time, it's going to be really up in the air as to whether he gets any other
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:18.120]  nominations.
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:23.320]  We're given what's going on with Robert Mueller and impeachment reports and everything else.
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:26.080]  It's not a happy time.
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:33.840]  And as you said, the Republican establishment so not need, you've got the Democrats saying,
[1:40:33.840 --> 1:40:36.040]  we're not going to confirm him no matter what.
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:38.480]  And then magically, this all pops up right on time.
[1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:42.240]  She's expunging her records, her eyewitness.
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.960]  Cabinon classmate says assault didn't happen.
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:49.800]  The assault claim oozed out of the fetid fever swamp on the left, which has been trying
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:55.400]  to derail Cabinon, one life or another, the New Americas reported unable to stop the eminently
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:00.240]  qualified jurist, Senator Dianne Feinstein, sent a stink bomb, the FBI claiming Cabinon
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:03.240]  assaulted a woman while he was in high school.
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:08.960]  The New Yorker, Rowan Farrow, who was chronicled the sex crimes and outrages of perverts and
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:12.160]  Hollywood media, got hold of the letter and published its contents.
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:14.640]  The account is short and lacks details.
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:22.040]  But now the man who she says was the witness to it has come out and said, as his name is
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:30.160]  Mark Judge, one of the classmates who she says is the witness says that it did not happen.
[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:32.240]  So what do you, what do you make of that?
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:38.200]  Well, it's helpful, but I'll talk as a lawyer now, rather than somebody in my heart who
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:42.880]  obviously views this as very problematic and suspect that this guy was involved himself,
[1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:45.560]  so you would expect him to deny it as well.
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:49.960]  But it doesn't matter, and this is the sad part, Alex, truth doesn't matter anymore.
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:50.960]  You know that.
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:54.480]  Look at what people have tried to do with you, with me, with other people who had principles
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:57.720]  that stand up, particularly for conservative principles.
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.280]  And that's what's happening in Cabinon at this point in time.
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:05.040]  And now you've got Jeff Blake, the outgoing senator from Arizona, calling for hearings,
[1:42:05.040 --> 1:42:06.040]  testimony under oath.
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:10.480]  You've got Susan Collins, his wavering, even have Kellyanne Conway in the White House,
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:15.400]  to some extent giving support to the woman in statements this morning, because the atmosphere
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:16.400]  Yeah.
[1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:18.480]  What do you make of Conway in the White House?
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:20.840]  She keeps pulling crap like that, virtue-signaling.
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:25.440]  Well, you know, the poor woman is between a rock and a hard place.
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:27.200]  Her husband is obviously out of control.
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:30.200]  I think he's suffering from Trump derangement syndrome.
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:36.760]  His membership in the Republican Establishment Club is in jeopardy because of his wife.
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:40.600]  And the poor woman, Kellyanne, and I sympathize with her, is trying to bend it over backwards
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:44.680]  to keep her marriage together with his lunatic that she's married to.
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.000]  And so she makes statements like that.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.200]  And it's not hopeful to the president.
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:50.280]  I'm sure the president's not happy this morning.
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:52.000]  Well, we knew they'd try to stop Cabinon.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  Now they've made their move.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  And I think more women are coming.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Stay with us.

[1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:12.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:17.280]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:26.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:31.400]  Constitutional lawyer, founder of Judicial Watch, Larry Claimant is our guest.
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:35.200]  Heads up, FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:39.800]  He's also one of the only, if not the only lawyer who's beaten the NSA in the federal
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:40.800]  court.
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:46.400]  And he's been a strident defender of our republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:55.200]  I think outside the box, I look at Communist China, where Apple and Google have moved,
[1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:59.400]  where they're helping sense of their own poor population, waging war on our free speech
[1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:00.400]  here in America.
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:07.560]  I see the left out of control, all the excesses of Hollywood, their real predatory hard-on
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:08.560]  for the American people.
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:14.280]  I think about China with the suicide nets at Apple factories, Foxcom, I think about
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:15.280]  all things they do.
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:20.880]  And they build up this thing about women being abused, where there's a mere allegation.
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:26.760]  Like I said earlier, that dinosaurs engaged in rape 25 million years ago, so we have to
[1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:31.800]  blow the planet up, it just becomes a clear political tool.
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.560]  And so I go back to her.
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:41.920]  Why, Larry Claimant, would you expunge your records in college at Stanford?
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:46.240]  Why would you get rid of your bios everywhere a month ago?
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:48.400]  Why would you get rid of all your social media?
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:50.180]  Why would you delete it all?
[1:48:50.180 --> 1:48:54.440]  Because it showed activism, and we caught a lot of it as serious hardcore democratic
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:55.440]  party activism.
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:49:00.520]  We found a lot of it in the Google way back machine, which we're adding in the article
[1:49:00.520 --> 1:49:03.120]  as it's updated.
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:06.520]  But again, why not leave those records up?
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:07.960]  I think this is all very suspect.
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:13.560]  A, and then B, as a lawyer, as somebody who's worked in D.C. a lot, how would you counter
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:15.160]  this if you're the Republicans?
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.880]  Because I mean, I would immediately, if you're just going to have emergency hearings on this,
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:25.560]  I would demand her basically release her phone records, all of it, to show that she's not
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:28.240]  been quarterbacking this with a Democrat's day one.
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:33.760]  I was to back up a little bit here, and this is the reality that we live in, as we talk
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.760]  about the cowardness of the Republican Party, but what I would do right immediately up front
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:45.760]  is to have Kavanaugh take a polygraph examination and let that become public with a reputable
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:50.880]  FBI polygraph examiner, retired, and have her do the same thing.
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:53.720]  And polygraphs are fairly accurate.
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:57.640]  So at least that's one piece of evidence that we could have that would clear this whole
[1:49:57.640 --> 1:49:58.640]  thing up.
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:01.160]  But the Democrats, obviously, this is orchestrated.
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:02.160]  They were planning it.
[1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:04.480]  They hoped it knocked Kavanaugh out before.
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:08.200]  They realized they weren't able to do that, so they were holding this back as their ace
[1:50:08.200 --> 1:50:09.200]  in the hole.
[1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.080]  And it's a very powerful ace in the hole, given the current climate, which is like the
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:18.040]  Salem witch trials out there, where men are presumed guilty until proven innocent.
[1:50:18.040 --> 1:50:21.800]  And again, there are Harvey Weinstein's and there are others who deserve what they got.
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:26.560]  But in this day and age, a man has little to no rights, and they know that.
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:31.240]  And they know that this matter is going to scare the heck out of the Republicans who
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:37.640]  are going to run exit stage left, no pun intended, given everything going on with social media.
[1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:43.120]  And they have a good shot of having this nomination withdrawn because it's going to affect the
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:46.480]  vote on November 6th in the midterm elections.
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.360]  There are a lot of women out there that are going to be watching this very carefully.
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:53.600]  And with the highly charged atmosphere we live in today, I'd say the Republicans are
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:58.680]  in the deep, you know what, frankly, and the Democrats have outfoxed them yet again.
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:00.760]  I don't think they're going to stand on principle.
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:06.680]  I don't think they're going to vote Kavanaugh through without, you know, something more
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:07.680]  that they can hang on to.
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:13.200]  And that's why I say both parties should take polygraphs tests right now and make it public.
[1:51:13.200 --> 1:51:14.200]  That's a good point.
[1:51:14.200 --> 1:51:17.120]  And we know why they're getting rid of her record.
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:22.640]  Kavanaugh accusary now learned donated Hillary Clinton 10 times, 60 plus liberal groups.
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:27.320]  I mean, this woman, and you can see Roger Stone, they're reporting on one of these shows.
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:33.880]  If you're watching on TV, they absolutely donated the kitchen sink.
[1:51:33.880 --> 1:51:34.880]  That is amazing.
[1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:35.880]  Well, yes.
[1:51:35.880 --> 1:51:39.400]  And look where she comes from, Northern California.
[1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:42.000]  That's the left of Beijing, China currently today.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:46.760]  And we know what you've gone through with Google, YouTube, I go through it as well.
[1:51:46.760 --> 1:51:48.800]  I brought a class action suit for FreedomWatch.
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:55.480]  You can see it at freedomwatchusa.org against Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Apple,
[1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:58.080]  Instagram for restraint of trade.
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:03.640]  The leftist CEOs of these companies want to squeeze any kind of conservative thought,
[1:52:03.640 --> 1:52:09.720]  media or advocacy out of the public discourse because their goal is a leftist takeover of
[1:52:09.720 --> 1:52:10.720]  this country.
[1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:15.160]  And when they get their politicians in controlling Washington, D.C. and around the states and
[1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:19.800]  in your hometown, they get favors bestowed upon them, which are going to make them even
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:20.800]  richer.
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:21.800]  These people are filthy rich.
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:25.400]  I was about to say, I mean, the Democrats have always been corrupt out of control, but
[1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:27.160]  they have no qualms now.
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:34.800]  They are just fire breathing, going for a brogue, and they are just, just psychotic.
[1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:36.400]  I mean, there's nothing they won't do.
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:43.320]  I have experienced lies in newspapers around the country that are total fabrications.
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:44.320]  People go, we'll sue them.
[1:52:44.320 --> 1:52:46.880]  I can't sue 10,000 publications.
[1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:51.760]  They just don't care to their crazed maniacs funded by big foreign banks.
[1:52:51.760 --> 1:52:58.320]  Funded by the Saudis, funded by George Soros, funded by the EU, and they just don't care.
[1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:00.840]  They're just going crazy.
[1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:02.340]  They're Bolsheviks.
[1:53:02.340 --> 1:53:07.080]  And if this scam doesn't work with the social media companies who are not only restraining
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:11.280]  trade and violation of Sherman 1, I'm a former, and I trust we're still at.
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:14.440]  I helped break up AT&T when I was at the Justice Department.
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:15.440]  It's also monopolization.
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:19.480]  And if they don't get what they want that way, it's going to resort to violence.
[1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:20.480]  We're going to be in the streets.
[1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:24.520]  We see that with anti-faw, with Black Lives Matter that's going dessert in Dallas.
[1:53:24.520 --> 1:53:26.280]  How do you bring that up?
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:27.520]  Because you're an expert in this.
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:30.640]  Let's go back to Sherman 1, Sherman 2, and I've had a big law firm that's involved that
[1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:32.140]  concur what you're saying.
[1:53:32.140 --> 1:53:33.140]  People go, oh, it's free market.
[1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:34.560]  No, it's not free market.
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:38.280]  When you go into modern communications and block all the conservatives and libertarians
[1:53:38.280 --> 1:53:42.840]  and Christians and then deny you're doing it, and then brag in internal documents you're
[1:53:42.840 --> 1:53:47.200]  doing it, explain as a lawyer how this is un-American, how it violates the First Amendment.
[1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:51.800]  They're going into the digital public commons, and basically like Nazi Germany saying no
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:53.600]  conservatives allowed.
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:54.600]  It's not true.
[1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:58.320]  Yes, it is a violation of First Amendment, and we have that in our complaint, and you
[1:53:58.320 --> 1:53:59.320]  can see it.
[1:53:59.320 --> 1:54:00.320]  FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:07.000]  But these companies, I believe, have an agreement between themselves, either explicit by moving
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  to power.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  They admit they do.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:12.960]  They've been having secret meetings admitting they meet to coordinate censoring us.
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:13.960]  That's a restraining of trade.
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:17.760]  You and I are competing not just horizontally with them, but vertically.
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:20.080]  I mean, I have FreedomWatchTV.
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:23.000]  I republish what I do on your show.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  We're getting all this out.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  So Dr. Brug admitted at Facebook months ago in front of Congress that he's competing as
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.400]  a media operation as well as a platform.
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:37.960]  So there's lots of grounds to move on this in an antitrust way, and of course, our cowardly
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:40.720]  do-nothing attorney general, he's got an antitrust division.
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:43.440]  I'm a proud alumnus when it used to do something.
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:45.840]  She says, oh, I'm going to have meetings with state's attorney general.
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:46.840]  You know what?
[1:54:46.840 --> 1:54:47.840]  You have an antitrust division.
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:49.840]  You don't need meetings with state's attorney general.
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:52.720]  Clearly, Sessions is spinning his wheels.
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:57.600]  Trump has all the power to stop this, but the control the globalists have of the Justice
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:00.120]  Department has green-lighted this purge.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:06.440]  Well, that's right, because Sessions has become the darling of the left, and these companies
[1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:07.840]  have stuck with everybody.
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:09.400]  They're more powerful than the NSA.
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:10.760]  I mean, they work with the NSA.
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:16.160]  They hand over information to the NSA, so they can destroy anybody they want with information
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.640]  that they've got.
[1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:22.800]  And of course, Mueller has subpoenaed a lot of it from these companies, and the politicians
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:26.240]  in Washington are scared to death of taking them on.
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:31.840]  It's only you and me and a few others who stood up to them, and we're continuing to stand
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:37.840]  up to them, and we need the support of the American people as we had going back to 1776.
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:40.920]  We need to rise up peacefully and legally, Alex, because-
[1:55:40.920 --> 1:55:41.920]  Oh, you're right.
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:43.840]  People don't, folks don't realize how incredible this time is.
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:45.280]  Larry Klayman, thank you so much.
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:49.000]  It was to support your work, your losses for freedom at FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  God bless you, and thank you.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.480]  God bless you, Alex.
[1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:58.520]  Folks, I mean, I cannot state to you how criminal this is, how insane this is, how these globalists
[1:55:58.520 --> 1:56:00.120]  are coming after everybody right now.
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:05.720]  It is just wild, and we're going to start the next hour, and tomorrow we'll be taking
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:06.720]  calls on this.
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:12.200]  And we're going to have Tyler Nixon on, and then Owen Schreuer about Implore's Army taking
[1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:16.520]  action politically, peacefully in the streets to get the word out at ball games, and church
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:22.720]  meetings, and PTA meetings, and city council, and state house, and federal meetings.
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.160]  You saw what I did a few weeks ago going into the Senate office building and getting
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:28.160]  in front of those cameras.
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:32.000]  People said, no one's ever done this, well, I just did it.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:38.920]  So the war is now 50 days out, and we'll put that URL on the screen for folks to go to
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:39.920]  the Implore's Army.
[1:56:39.920 --> 1:56:42.440]  It's important to do that on radio and TV.
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:45.240]  I think probably the page we built needs to have the URL on it.
[1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:48.200]  That's just one of the things I would do, but that's something I said a few weeks ago.
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:50.200]  We'll see what happens.
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:56.480]  Now, we're going to start the next hour, but I'm just going to say this.
[1:56:56.480 --> 1:57:00.760]  We need your financial support, plus you need t-shirts to wear your colors loud and proud
[1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:02.120]  and meet like-minded people.

[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:33.200]  Well, you knew they were going to try to stop a Supreme Court nominee with a great record
[2:00:33.200 --> 2:00:34.200]  getting in.
[2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:35.200]  There was an anti-gun.
[2:00:35.200 --> 2:00:36.200]  It was an anti-American.
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:41.640]  You knew it was coming, and you know they're not going to stop.
[2:00:41.640 --> 2:00:47.040]  But I want to go to a report here from John Bowne.
[2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:54.040]  Our Democrats advocating domestic terrorism, well, does a bear crap in the woods is the
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.040]  larger question.
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:59.320]  I know that's a silly statement to make, but we're going to go to this, and then we have
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:03.880]  Tyler Nixon, constitutional lawyer, joining us, and then, you know, I've noticed with
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:10.720]  contests and websites and things that they have to make sense to be successful.
[2:01:10.720 --> 2:01:16.080]  And you've got to then, like I did with Bill Clinton as a rapist, you've got to like have
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:21.200]  a site, promote it, and then take what people did so that they can go to a spot and see
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:22.200]  what they did.
[2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:24.400]  And I looked at InfoWars Army, and I'm glad Owen had this idea.
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:28.840]  I had an idea of the audience to go out and do stuff, but I'm taking that site down because
[2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:29.840]  you can't navigate it.
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:30.840]  It doesn't make sense.
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:31.840]  It doesn't work.
[2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:32.840]  And nobody's bad.
[2:01:32.840 --> 2:01:33.840]  It's great.
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:35.320]  We're just not going to pretend anymore.
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:40.800]  So we have a site where the people's submissions and the articles are there, and then where
[2:01:40.800 --> 2:01:44.120]  you can show what Owen did when he went out and showed what you're supposed to do.
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:46.720]  So like, here's what InfoWars Army is, a nation statement.
[2:01:46.720 --> 2:01:49.120]  And we're going to go out on the streets.
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:50.680]  We're going to do all this.
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:52.680]  We're going to keep them from censoring us on the web.
[2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:57.840]  You need an opening video explaining what InfoWars Army is.
[2:01:57.840 --> 2:01:59.160]  And I'll do this on air.
[2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:02.360]  I've noticed what I do on air tends to happen.
[2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:06.160]  And so you've got an opening page, because God love Owen.
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:07.160]  He's fighting so hard doing this.
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:08.840]  I was showing everything else.
[2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:12.240]  But I was just thinking about how important this is this weekend, and I was looking at
[2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:14.360]  the page we made at InfoWarsArmy.com.
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:18.560]  It's like sign up, finish your email when you do something, and then Owen sees the videos
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:20.720]  you do, and then it's on InfoWars.
[2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:25.400]  What you do is you create, you create a site.
[2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:28.040]  And then you say, here's our mission with a video.
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:29.240]  And then here's our mission in text.
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:35.160]  And then here we're going to post below the latest videos and things you go out and do.
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:38.280]  And then you promote, you have those folks on the air.
[2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.440]  And then you post those videos there, and there's an archive.
[2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:43.440]  That's what you do.
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:50.160]  You can't have a black hole page that's just got a, this is for anybody out there watching,
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:54.320]  a black hole page that just says InfoWarsArmy and you put your email in.
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:55.320]  That'll go nowhere.
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:56.800]  It's why we don't do contests anymore.
[2:02:56.800 --> 2:03:00.800]  Over the years, we've been off more than we could chew, whatever.
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:03.320]  And I'm just getting this out here so it stops.
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:07.640]  And so I always hear about a new contest, but I'm like, with a contest, we have to watch
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:08.640]  the videos.
[2:03:08.640 --> 2:03:12.200]  See, I always launch the contest.
[2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:14.960]  No, no more contests.
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:16.560]  I have to launch them.
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:18.040]  There have to be meetings.
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:24.880]  And then we have to say what the contest is, have the page, and then give power to it.
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:27.280]  Where you get it, you promote it, you have them on.
[2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:33.400]  And then you've got people all over the country saying, Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:35.480]  See that?
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:37.640]  That's when you do that.
[2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:45.520]  That's when you actually follow through.
[2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:51.000]  So InfoWarsArmy is going to be removed because I looked at it.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:55.960]  And we're going to really launch this in the next week.
[2:03:55.960 --> 2:04:00.560]  And it's going to take the country back with 50 days out because we need you to go to city
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:05.400]  council meetings, to go to C-SPAN, to go to public events, legally and lawfully, go to
[2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:09.880]  sporting events, unfurl banners, hell, I'll show you how it's done, I'll go do it all.
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:11.400]  I'll do it.
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:15.480]  Just like Owen went to that illegal alien meeting at the church, ignoring the 1,000 troops
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:19.000]  with guns coming across the border, he's trying to pround the pump there.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:22.520]  But we've got to have a site where we promote it, not just put up on the site and blackhole
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:23.520]  it.
[2:04:23.520 --> 2:04:28.400]  It's got to be on a site where it's all on one page.
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:32.920]  That's how the architecture of this works, okay?
[2:04:32.920 --> 2:04:35.360]  And then that's how we're going to get this done.
[2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:37.400]  So Owen is not coming up at the bottom of the aisle.
[2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:41.760]  We're going to rebroadcast after this next guest, and then we're going to relaunch him
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:43.240]  for his army for real.
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:47.560]  Because you don't give him, like somebody in the army, you know, those little rubber
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.360]  guns with these little dart out that's rubber.
[2:04:51.360 --> 2:04:56.440]  That's not what you give to somebody in the army, or Owen just doesn't have any weapons.
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:05:00.240]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:04.760]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:10.200]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:15.600]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:17.120]  to unhealthy levels.
[2:05:17.120 --> 2:05:23.640]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[2:05:23.640 --> 2:05:27.640]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[2:05:27.640 --> 2:05:28.920]  in the rainwater.
[2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:34.360]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:40.440]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:46.080]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:51.400]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[2:05:51.400 --> 2:06:07.680]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[2:06:07.680 --> 2:06:37.520]  We'll see you in the next video.
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:40.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:40.840 --> 2:06:48.240]  I am Alex Jones, your host, infowars.com, and newswars.com are the major websites, and
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:55.800]  I want to go to a very, very special report that we have not aired yet here on air, like
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:07:02.160]  14 minutes long, that is Eric Boling talking about what really makes Trump tech.
[2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:10.160]  Because I hear over and over and over and over again that Trump doesn't stand for anything.
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:15.760]  But you know, Trump does stand for something, and that's free market America, and not having
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:20.400]  clicks and not having globalists, and not having these groups that come in and try to
[2:07:20.400 --> 2:07:21.960]  control the paradigm.
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:25.960]  That's what he stands for.
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:33.360]  So after the break, we're going to have that video for you.
[2:07:33.360 --> 2:07:36.360]  And again, it's up on infowars.com.
[2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:43.760]  The title of the video is, Ladies and gentlemen, Get Ready For This.
[2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:46.640]  Eric Boling, Trump's ideology is America.
[2:07:46.640 --> 2:07:52.000]  Part of that powerful interview will be in the next segment.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.960]  But first, these reports are too important.
[2:07:54.960 --> 2:07:55.960]  I mentioned them.
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:56.960]  So we're going to air them right now.
[2:07:56.960 --> 2:08:02.560]  EU Internet Killing Legislation, we're going to air that that goes after memes, everything
[2:08:02.560 --> 2:08:03.560]  else has passed.
[2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:07.240]  And then we're going to air as Democrats advocating domestic terrorism, as I mentioned
[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:08.240]  that.
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:10.640]  Both these reports are so important from John Bound.
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:16.880]  And so we're going to air EU Internet Killing Legislation right now at infowars.com.
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:20.000]  And then coming up, we've got so much more for you today.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  Here it is.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:26.720]  The EU Parliament recently put the Internet, at least in Europe, on a path towards certain
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:28.960]  corporate Orwellian doom.
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:35.400]  This discussion is bedeviled by all sorts of artificial media, Twitch storms and hysteria
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:36.400]  of one kind or another.
[2:08:36.400 --> 2:08:41.400]  There's a very good argument against the lack of democracy in the EU.
[2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:42.400]  Isn't it funny?
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:48.800]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to leave the campaign
[2:08:48.800 --> 2:08:54.080]  to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:57.800]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[2:08:57.800 --> 2:09:04.640]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did is you have, by stealth, by
[2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:10.520]  deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:17.080]  of Europe, you have imposed upon them a political union.
[2:09:17.080 --> 2:09:24.040]  Article 11, also known as the link tax, forces anyone linking an article of more than one
[2:09:24.040 --> 2:09:29.920]  word to a news story to pay for a service that licenses the article.
[2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:35.160]  That news site can, according to The Verge, charge anything they want for the right to
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:40.960]  quote them or refuse to sell altogether, effectively giving them the right to choose
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:42.880]  who can criticize them.
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:49.720]  While Article 13, also known as the upload filter, requires all but the smallest platforms
[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:55.920]  will have to defensively adopt copyright filters that examine everything you post and
[2:09:55.920 --> 2:10:02.960]  censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:08.040]  And if that wasn't enough to bring the free flow of information to a grinding halt, typical
[2:10:08.040 --> 2:10:14.280]  social media posts like a selfie taken at a football game have been targeted by Article
[2:10:14.280 --> 2:10:15.280]  12A.
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:21.900]  No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches, only the organizers of sports matches
[2:10:21.900 --> 2:10:26.840]  will have the right to publicly post any kind of record of the match.
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:31.480]  No posting your selfies or short videos of exciting plays.
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:33.080]  You are the audience.
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:39.640]  Your job is to sit where you're told, passively watch the game, and go home, according to
[2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:40.640]  the EFF.
[2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:45.240]  Also, a freedom of panorama exemption wasn't accepted.
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:50.200]  For example, if you take a selfie on a busy street and license material happens to be
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:56.580]  in your shot, whether it's a t-shirt, a license architectural design, a.k.a. a building or
[2:10:56.580 --> 2:11:02.400]  a billboard, you will be infringing on a copyright, also not covered.
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:09.880]  Anything we regard in America as fair use, no user-generated content exemption, which
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:16.400]  would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright for using excerpts from works
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:22.560]  for criticism, review, illustration, caricature, parody, or pastiche.
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:25.600]  EU Army to increase ranks sevenfold.
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:30.560]  I remember 10 years ago saying there's a secret plan for an EU Army because it had actually
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:32.560]  come out in documents.
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:35.160]  It actually got in documents from someone inside Bilderberg.
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:42.600]  They were discussing an EU Army to stop countries from having their own borders.
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:47.600]  They were going to flood Europe with North Africans and Islamists out of the Middle East.
[2:11:47.600 --> 2:11:48.600]  It's all true.
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:49.600]  It all happened.
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:50.600]  Of course, it was real documents we got.
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:55.480]  Then a guy who works at the National Archives brought me secret Bilderberg documents the
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:57.440]  next year confirming it all.
[2:11:57.440 --> 2:11:59.680]  We published them all.
[2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:01.200]  I did get that threat.
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:05.040]  Now, the Junker, when you look at the unelected head of the EU that England didn't vote to
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:08.480]  enter but they're in the UK, he is the grandson.
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:10.520]  His father was the top Nazi.
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:13.680]  His grandfather was the richest guy in Germany.
[2:12:13.680 --> 2:12:15.960]  Royalty, the Junker family.
[2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:19.880]  And then you have an unelected EU that was actually a Hitler plan, the EU.
[2:12:19.880 --> 2:12:20.880]  Look it up.
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:21.880]  That's even BBC.
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:22.880]  I typed it into search engine.
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:25.240]  EU was Nazi plan.
[2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:29.640]  And then you learn about all this and it's just like, who could make this stuff up?
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:35.600]  The intended filter system will create a big brother style log jam where smaller platforms
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:41.440]  and creators will have to face a monstrous bureaucracy to allow content or even keep
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:43.160]  control of their own.
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:48.760]  The EU celebrated the decision with smitten glee, unaware that they are shooting themselves
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  in the foot.
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:56.240]  The final vote won't take place until January of 2019, but it is expected to pass.
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:14.240]  John Bound reporting.
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:20.000]  We're supposed to stand up to discrimination and we're sure as heck supposed to stand up
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:23.800]  clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers.
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:30.320]  How hard can that be saying that Nazis are bad?
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:36.680]  Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including
[2:13:36.680 --> 2:13:45.400]  the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:48.120]  we hold dear as Americans.
[2:13:48.120 --> 2:13:54.600]  We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal.
[2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:57.720]  We are equal in the eyes of our creator.
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:04.160]  We are equal under the law and we are equal under our constitution.
[2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:06.320]  How many times do I have to reject?
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:12.680]  I've rejected David Duke, rejected David Duke, I've rejected the KKK, the Utlurks
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:13.880]  Land.
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:16.520]  From the time I'm five years old, I rejected them.
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:20.880]  When I put out that I reject the KKK and David Duke, nobody picks it up.
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:22.160]  You know why they're not?
[2:14:22.160 --> 2:14:23.160]  Because they don't want to pick it up.
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:24.160]  They pick it up.
[2:14:24.160 --> 2:14:25.160]  You pick it up.
[2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:26.160]  Everyone else picks it up.
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:30.000]  You so simultaneously, practically at the same time, they don't want to pick it up.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:35.680]  Gateway-pundit journalist Cassandra Fairbanks posted this inviting message on her Twitter.
[2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:38.760]  It simply read, who is going to the MAGA meetup tonight?
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:46.320]  A response from Dreamstar Justice that, according to Daily Mail, supports the Democratic Socialist,
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:51.200]  stated by saying, I am coming with a gun and I expect to get numerous bloodstained MAGA
[2:14:51.200 --> 2:14:52.680]  hats as trophies.
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:58.360]  DC police vehicles were spotted outside of the hotel where the event was to take place,
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:03.240]  and a manager confirmed that staff were aware of the threat and taking appropriate security
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:04.240]  measures.
[2:15:04.240 --> 2:15:09.960]  Meanwhile, the Daily Caller reports, California man Farzad Fazele was arrested Tuesday for
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:14.520]  allegedly trying to stab a congressional candidate at a fair on Sunday.
[2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:15.520]  Police said.
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:20.480]  Some media identified the candidate as Republican Rudy Peters, who is challenging Democratic
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:23.400]  Representative Eric Smallwell in November.
[2:15:23.400 --> 2:15:28.840]  Peters survived serious injury thanks to a malfunctioning switchblade, the Almeida County
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:30.280]  Sheriff's Office said.
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:35.920]  The attempted stabbing was preceded by Fazele making disparaging remarks about the Republican
[2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:39.320]  Party and President Trump, according to the Sheriff's Office.
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:44.840]  Steve Scalise, who survived a mass shooting by a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter, warned
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:49.840]  on a recent podcast.

[2:17:56.080 --> 2:18:02.440]  I want to plow into all of this, I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:08.840]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:16.080]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[2:18:16.080 --> 2:18:21.000]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.680]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:30.720]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it, you cannot beat that

[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:41.760]  dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or triple-A253-3139, and
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:46.160]  your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:50.000]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  Next two, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:04.320]  and how much we were buying, and they said, oh we want more money, more money, and oh
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:10.320]  this and that, and so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:14.280]  ingredient that goes in next to it, that literally is so pure that if you put in a peaker dish
[2:19:14.280 --> 2:19:19.680]  on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie, and it's purple gas,
[2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:23.520]  I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your body when you take it, we're working
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:28.680]  on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered
[2:19:28.680 --> 2:19:32.880]  it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done,
[2:19:32.880 --> 2:19:37.560]  I'm breaking the contract, well I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially
[2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:42.880]  the last run, in fact right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:47.040]  good supply of it, it'll be gone in a couple of months, X2, if you haven't experienced
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:51.720]  it, informerstore.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you stop up on it, it's available
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:58.960]  right now for a limited time, informerstore.com, it's 25% off right now.
[2:19:58.960 --> 2:20:11.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, from the front lines of the Information War, it's
[2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:12.320]  Alex Jones.
[2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:19.440]  I want you to really talk about President Trump and just who he is and who this amazing
[2:20:19.440 --> 2:20:20.440]  success is.
[2:20:20.440 --> 2:20:25.600]  He is, everything on the left doesn't believe he should be or could be, and he's driving
[2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:31.160]  them crazy, they're going absolutely that crazy about trying to figure out why he's
[2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:34.920]  succeeding, he's succeeding because he's doing everything that he said he was going to do
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:38.840]  and everything that frankly the Republicans or the conservatives said they were going
[2:20:38.840 --> 2:20:45.080]  to do but never have done, lower taxes, brought regulations down, cutting slashing regulations,
[2:20:45.080 --> 2:20:50.280]  and that's really unleashing a powerful business atmosphere, environment in America, people
[2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:53.720]  are doing business here, and I love the idea that he's got other world leaders on their
[2:20:53.720 --> 2:20:56.120]  heels going, what's he going to do next?
[2:20:56.120 --> 2:20:57.840]  Is he crazy enough to drop a bomb?
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:02.120]  Maybe he is, maybe he's not, they're all worried, so I get calls from the BBC, I get
[2:21:02.120 --> 2:21:06.000]  calls from Canadian television, I get calls from Norwegian television, I get calls from
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:09.960]  countries all over the world saying, is he stable, is he okay, I'm like yeah, he's doing
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:13.480]  great and the fact that you're calling me, it means it's even better because you don't
[2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:15.480]  know what he's up to, that's fantastic.
[2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:18.800]  Then by the way, he's doing it to the left too, they don't know what to do with him,
[2:21:18.800 --> 2:21:19.800]  they don't know how to compete with him.
[2:21:19.800 --> 2:21:23.040]  Meanwhile, he can't compete with them because all they have, the whole left's platform
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:26.720]  is, we hate Trump, you should too, and that's, you're never going to get elected on that
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:27.720]  platform.
[2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:32.760]  Well, meanwhile, North Korea is making deals, they have stopped showing their missiles,
[2:21:32.760 --> 2:21:36.320]  they have destroyed sites, they're moving in the right direction towards the US instead
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:40.080]  of China, that's a huge victory right there, nobody else could get that done.
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:44.600]  Yeah, you did it, you got that done, but more importantly, who's the anonymous op-ed writer
[2:21:44.600 --> 2:21:48.720]  in the New York Times, but no one, why did the New York Times publish him, he or she,
[2:21:48.720 --> 2:21:52.480]  and who is it, if this person is so worried about the Republic, they're concerned Donald
[2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:56.280]  Trump isn't stable enough, they don't like what he's doing, even though he's succeeding,
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:22:00.040]  that they went to the New York Times and said, don't worry, we have it from the inside, we're
[2:22:00.040 --> 2:22:04.800]  pulling shit away from him, we're making sure he doesn't do other things, that's dangerous.
[2:22:04.800 --> 2:22:07.960]  You want to talk about conspiracy theories, Alex, where does that guy come from?
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:10.840]  Well, that's mutiny, and the word is, it's a consortium.
[2:22:10.840 --> 2:22:11.840]  How about treason?
[2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:12.840]  It is treason.
[2:22:12.840 --> 2:22:13.840]  Yeah.
[2:22:13.840 --> 2:22:14.840]  Punish will buy?
[2:22:14.840 --> 2:22:15.840]  Death.
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:16.840]  Death.
[2:22:16.840 --> 2:22:21.080]  So these, the cover's getting better, and then they're saying, oh, he didn't have success,
[2:22:21.080 --> 2:22:22.840]  we blocked him as well, he had success.
[2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:27.360]  Okay, so you love Obama, and you love the Clintons, why didn't you give us the success?
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:32.760]  It's not true, it's a different economic theory, the theory was, let's spread it around, let
[2:22:32.760 --> 2:22:36.560]  government take care of you, government will decide the winners and the losers, and then
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:41.280]  on the global stage, let's not get too much, let's not get too greedy, let's let other
[2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:45.400]  people play in the game too, well that's not good business, businesses, I'm going to take
[2:22:45.400 --> 2:22:50.480]  you out, I'm going to take you out, because we need to win, in business, you're beholden
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:56.560]  to the shareholders, not to be a nice company, a nice guy, to make money, to be successful.
[2:22:56.560 --> 2:23:00.680]  Trump brought that mentality to the White House and said, we don't care about Mexico,
[2:23:00.680 --> 2:23:04.800]  we don't care about Canada, we care about America, we don't care about Germany, screw
[2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:08.400]  you guys, we're going to cut the best deals for America, and frankly the world's never
[2:23:08.400 --> 2:23:09.400]  seen it before.
[2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:12.640]  No, I agree, but I've looked at the deals, after we had like half the world's wealth,
[2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:17.480]  4% of the population after World War II, by the 60s, the egalitarian liberal said, we're
[2:23:17.480 --> 2:23:21.520]  going to parlay America's power into this whole global thing, so Trump, what do you
[2:23:21.520 --> 2:23:22.520]  say he's being hard-nosed?
[2:23:22.520 --> 2:23:27.160]  He's like, you've got a 280% tariff, cut it in half, or we're going to totally shut
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:32.400]  you down, and then Canada won't do it, so I think all he's asking for is, like okay,
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:37.240]  Apple, you've got 200 factories in China, built in here, I mean I don't even think
[2:23:37.240 --> 2:23:42.040]  he's being hard-balled, he's like, God, do something, he's one step better.
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:45.560]  So, we're not, I'm not going to talk into Trump, I'm not going to talk you into bringing
[2:23:45.560 --> 2:23:48.160]  a factory here, I'll make it worth your while.
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:53.160]  I'm lowering the import, the repatriation fees to bring money back into the United States,
[2:23:53.160 --> 2:23:57.280]  so that Apple, you do bring the money back here, and build plants here, because clearly
[2:23:57.280 --> 2:23:58.280]  they'd rather do it here.
[2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:03.440]  No, I agree, but here's the problem, we had a 40% corporate tax, it goes to 15, China
[2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:08.640]  goes to 15, they go to zero, if it becomes state run, so you know Apple and Google are
[2:24:08.640 --> 2:24:14.880]  moving to China to get the 0% tax, then the left attacks Trump, and says he's a traitor,
[2:24:14.880 --> 2:24:18.920]  lowering it to 15, cheating people, when in truth, all that does is take the money out
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:22.880]  of the country, Trump's trying to bring it back, so how do you educate people about what
[2:24:22.880 --> 2:24:26.920]  these leftist companies are doing?
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:30.960]  Trump's agenda is America first, they've never been, they've never described to America
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:35.920]  first, they've described to America as part of the global leader in humanitarianism, that's
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:40.840]  not the way you become successful, and frankly when China, when China's economy is starting
[2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:46.360]  to slow, and we're rising, that's the time to put your foot on the neck of the Chinese
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:48.360]  economy so that we get that money back.
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:51.480]  And they're doing it, and I was looking at it, so how far should he push, he's already
[2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:54.240]  got some concessions, how far should he push?
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:58.760]  Keep going, keep going, get them to zero, and import fees, we'll go to zero with them,
[2:24:58.760 --> 2:25:02.120]  bring them up to where they are, and China was here, we were here, bring it up, they
[2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:05.800]  go, oh my god, you're horrible, guess what, we're horrible, then lower your tariffs,
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:06.800]  they lower it, we lower it.
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:10.400]  But who can disagree with that, it's level, like we don't play football like this.
[2:25:10.400 --> 2:25:17.840]  You know what, the least free trade entity is, the least free trade entity is a free
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:24.120]  trade agreement, they are premeditated trade, when we, NAFTA, North American Free Trade
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:30.480]  Agreement, Canada, America, Mexico, when a company from Germany comes over and says,
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:35.580]  we want to build XYZ widgets, with you America, under NAFTA, we have to say yeah, that's
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:39.320]  great, we'll take that, but guess what, we have to farm out some of it to Mexico, under
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:43.040]  NAFTA, and we also have to give some to Canada, under NAFTA.
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:47.000]  Below those deals out of the water, get rid of Mexico and Canada, and go to Germany and
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.560]  say, we want your business, we'll do business with you, oh, Canada, you want to play, fine,
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:54.040]  we'll do business with you, Mexico, you too, great, we'll do business with you.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:57.800]  Exactly, we had all the cards, and then we dealt, gave them away, and then the last minute
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:01.800]  Trump was back, in closing though, because I know Trump's a private guy, you're a private
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:04.920]  guy, but he does love you, he talks about it, the person.
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:05.920]  He calls me.
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  Yeah.
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:07.920]  He has regular phone calls from the president.
[2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:08.920]  So amazing.
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:12.600]  So, people need to know, because they're saying he's retarded, he's an idiot, none of us
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:18.160]  true, we know that, because again, this idiot turned it all around, no, so who is he, what's
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:21.760]  his goal, I'm going to get off the thing, I want to zoom in on you, spend a few minutes
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:29.800]  on Trump, the person, because he's a brand and marketing guru, quick story, in 2016,
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:34.200]  when he announced he was running for president, it was right before the big debate with Megan
[2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:38.960]  Kelly, I had him on the show, and he says something in the middle of a show, and I had
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:43.320]  this one-on-one interview, and he says, you know, Jeb Bush, low energy Jeb, and I was
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:47.960]  like, what's low energy Jeb, and this is on air, I didn't see any of this coming, and
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:53.280]  he said, yeah, yeah, low energy Jeb, that was the first time he ever announced any of
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:27:00.560]  his branding, low energy Jeb, Lion Ted, Crooked Hillary, here's what Trump is, he's a marketer,
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:07.160]  he's a brand master, and he also knows people and countries and companies, Achilles, and
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:10.960]  he exploits them for the good of the country, and the good of America, and the good of the
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:15.680]  American people, and what happens is, the left goes crazy because they can't compete
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:19.600]  with them, they don't understand them enough to fight, if you don't know your enemy, you're
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:24.200]  not going to be able to succeed against your enemy, and frankly the left is at war with
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:28.240]  the right, with Trump, so he's so good at keeping them on their heels, all they can
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:32.560]  do is be anti-Trump, they can't be for something, they have to be against something, and they'll
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:36.840]  never win being against something, they can only win being for something, Trump is for
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:41.520]  something, he's for growing the economy, I'll tell you what, it motivates Trump, he's going
[2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:47.200]  to go down as the most successful United States president in modern history, and that matters
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:51.560]  to him, well look, I think he's motivated by success, he wants to take credit for being
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:55.760]  the most successful president in modern history, and I think he will, and that motivates him
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:27:59.680]  like it would motivate anybody, but if his policies weren't working, he couldn't take
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:05.320]  that victory lap that he likes to take, I'll give you a quick story, it was about three
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:11.160]  weeks ago, I was on Morning Joe for two days in a row, and I had a real robust debate with
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:15.600]  Charlie Sykes, who's an anti-Trump Republican, and we were going back and forth, we got off
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:20.240]  the second day of the debate, it was a two-day debate, and my phone rings, I'm in the hotel
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.920]  in DC, my phone rings, and it's Trump, and he says, look, you did great on that, that
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:28.320]  was great, everything you said was right along what we're looking at, what we're trying to
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:32.320]  do, and we talked, and it was really cool that he watched it and he knew what was going
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:37.440]  on, but then he said, you know, this smaller investigation, it really is driving me crazy,
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:41.040]  they don't have anything, there's nothing, there's no shred of evidence in a year and
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.800]  a half, and he said, but it annoys me, because I got to think about this instead of getting
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:55.600]  back to what really matters, making the economy better, making America the first.

[2:32:55.160 --> 2:33:02.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:22.200]  Embraced wild conspiracy theories by those surrounding Benghazi or my birth certificate.
[2:33:22.200 --> 2:33:29.080]  The response was hey if Benghazi conspiracy theory let's do this and tell me if it's
[2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:33.400]  conspiracy theory after this or conspiracy. Let's put you on the roof and I said let's
[2:33:33.400 --> 2:33:39.240]  put your ass cowardly ass on the roof and shoot AK-47s and RPGs and lob mortars at you for 13
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:43.880]  hours why you left why you didn't send in your support. Basically I just said what happened
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:48.920]  that night it's a disgrace and it's what a dog but he's a narcissist he's a sociopath what
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:53.480]  else do you expect and people are I hope now are starting to see that I think more people are that
[2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:57.800]  are on the road starting to see how narcissistic he is and he's going to try to rewrite history
[2:33:57.800 --> 2:34:01.240]  but it's not going to happen I'm not going to let him do it especially not in Benghazi because
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:06.040]  I did lose friends that night we did try to sacrifice ourselves we did to make sure others
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:10.600]  came home and Ronan did Ronan above did sacrifice themselves they gave the ultimate sacrifice and
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:15.080]  you don't you don't you don't uh integrate that you don't treat that as a negative uh
[2:34:15.080 --> 2:34:19.160]  barrack for st. Obama and say it didn't happen when guys did gave it their lives because you
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:30.680]  didn't you didn't feel like doing anything. Well we just saw the 17th anniversary of 9-11
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:35.400]  earlier this week but it was also another anniversary of the 6th anniversary of Benghazi
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:41.880]  of my I don't have a teleprompter here uh so uh we've got Chris Tonto Peronto one of the main heroes
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:47.960]  of the patriots that survived at the tragic event there at the uh US special mission annex in Benghazi
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:52.920]  Libya when Hillary stood down and Obama stood down we'll play the clip next segment where Obama got
[2:34:52.920 --> 2:34:59.240]  got a lot of trouble this weekend last weekend saying that Benghazi didn't even happen conspiracy
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:05.720]  theory that's my bad Obama imitation even a lot of liberals said that is next level so uh we'll be
[2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:09.800]  talking about all of that with Chris but you're there in Alabama I guess that big old hurricane's
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:14.920]  a little bit north of you yeah no it's it's a little ways on the uh on the Atlantic coast we're
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:19.560]  closer to the uh the Gulf it didn't come this way so I think I think we're okay in fact I wish we
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:25.240]  had a little bit of cloud cover it's 100 degrees out in 100 100 percent humidity it's it's it's hot
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:30.360]  it's hot and you're out there doing some firearms training with citizens yeah actually yep of course
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:34.360]  so I have a company called battle line tactical myself and Dave Boone Benton uh Ben Morgan from
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:38.280]  Morgan timing system Larry Stevenson Larry the black bearded cowboy he's one of my instructors
[2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:42.840]  there's been a class of we uh we uh come out we teach people how to shoot and teach God defend
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:47.400]  themselves and be more confident and it's it's a great it's a great day great day to be out here
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:51.400]  shooting yeah well speaking of censorship we'll get into the main meat of the interview here
[2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:56.360]  in the start of the next segment but speaking of all the censorship uh you've got chris tonto
[2:35:56.360 --> 2:36:02.600]  peranto.com uh at chris peranto on twitter where are other places for people to get to you if you
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:07.240]  do get totally banned on twitter because you just got suspended this week oh yeah yeah facebook I have
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:11.880]  a public page and a private page the public page is just chris chris peranto you can look for a
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:17.160]  battle line tactical that's my facebook page 14th hour foundation that's my facebook page I have a
[2:36:17.160 --> 2:36:21.800]  a foundation as well and then instagram I'm pretty pretty uh regular on and it's just chris
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:27.240]  underscore peranto underscore tonto I still can't get verified by any of them except facebook
[2:36:27.240 --> 2:36:32.040]  still figure so uh you won't see a blue check mark I'm trying though but I guess I'm not I'm
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:36.520]  I guess I'm not important enough and you know so what in their eyes so uh if you don't see a blue
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:42.200]  check mark just go chris underscore peranto underscore tonto and that's me that's right fake
[2:36:42.200 --> 2:36:45.960]  accounts are a big problem and now that I've been taken off twitter everywhere else they've got all
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:50.840]  these fake accounts saying I'm Alex Jones and saying horrible kkk stuff you name it it's very
[2:36:50.840 --> 2:36:55.640]  clear that once they silence you then they can really lie about you yeah yeah then they can spin
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:37:00.520]  and then and paint uh paint the general public uh any picture they want about you luckily for me
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:05.080]  though and out to me I will talk about it I I this has been honestly a blessing because
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:09.000]  people are starting to say holy crap what was being a lot people didn't know what Benghazi was
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:13.080]  and now they're like oh my gosh what was Benghazi this actually happened and here's a guy that was
[2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:17.240]  part of it and then they go see pig or they find Oz and they see there are other guys out there so
[2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:21.880]  it's not just me trying to vouch for a story or what happened there's there was a whole team
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:27.480]  that was left behind by this is like holocaust denial because they say that I'm denying uh
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:32.440]  sandy hook which I'm not they just edit tapes together and take out a context but then he's
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:37.560]  literally saying it's a conspiracy theory it's it's crazy and and again as long as there's people
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:42.840]  like myself like yourself out there standing up and saying and calling them on it calling them on
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:47.240]  their bs whether I get banned or not I'm still gonna keep calling them on it good people because
[2:37:47.240 --> 2:37:51.800]  this country still has fantastic american spirit good people are still going to see the truth and
[2:37:51.800 --> 2:37:55.800]  they're going to come forward but like you said brother and I would spend this before it's american
[2:37:55.800 --> 2:37:59.320]  we just kind of keep pushing and pushing and overcoming obstacles like we do that's what we
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:03.880]  do as american when we come back we got one more segment with you and I know you're busy
[2:38:03.880 --> 2:38:08.040]  they training and we work in seven days a week and public speaking and farms training very exciting
[2:38:08.040 --> 2:38:13.640]  I want to get right into Benghazi and what really did happen and play the club from obama and so
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:18.040]  much more but just briefly the 30 seconds we have what do you make of the big tech giants google
[2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:22.280]  and apple moving to china I think it's a national security threat and they wouldn't work with our
[2:38:22.280 --> 2:38:26.120]  military google won't but they're helping the chinese military with AI I think these are trees
[2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:32.280]  and it's companies I and I haven't seen anything to to think otherwise to be honest with you it
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:38.600]  is about money maybe um are they taking american jobs away well it looks like it um so it's just
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:43.320]  in that respect I think it's treasonous but uh it's a definite definite eye open for the
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:47.080]  administration the trump administration they need to keep an eye on it I'm not a big person of the
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:52.360]  long big government but we have companies private companies that may be uh other than espionage
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:39:00.280]  all the right back embraced wild conspiracy theories by those surrounding Benghazi
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:12.200]  or my birth certificate rejected science rejected facts on things like climate change
[2:39:12.200 --> 2:39:23.480]  embraced a rising absolutism from a willingness to default on america's debt by not paying our bills
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:32.440]  to a refusal to even meet much less consider a qualified nominee for the supreme court because
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:36.840]  he happened to be nominated by a democratic president I mean all of that is a lie then
[2:39:36.840 --> 2:39:42.360]  gazi happened the standout happened a bunch people got killed they used the security force that the
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:47.960]  hillary was already in control of to come attack the base we have chris tonto peranto on uh earlier
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:54.920]  this week he got suspended on twitter for countering that clip and saying no it happened my buddies were
[2:39:54.920 --> 2:40:00.280]  there I lost friends everybody knows what happened it's come out now thanks to his and the rest of
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:04.920]  his team's courage and survivors and those that died courage so so so chris you got a chance to
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:09.960]  respond to the president uh the former president uh the fact that he just mixed you in with a bunch
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:14.840]  of other stuff I mean it sounds like denying hitler killed jews or it sounds like when they say
[2:40:14.840 --> 2:40:18.840]  I'm denying a sandy hook happened out of context I think sandy hook happened but but how dare him
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:24.280]  say that implied Benghazi like is a conspiracy theory just hoping we're stupid uh what do you
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:29.400]  think's going on here and how did you respond on twitter that got censored well the response was
[2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:34.120]  hey if Benghazi conspiracy theory let's do this and then tell me if it's conspiracy theory after
[2:40:34.120 --> 2:40:39.400]  this or conspiracy let's put you on the roof and I said let's put your ass cowardly ass on the roof
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:45.240]  and shoot ak-47s and rpgs and a lot more is at you for 13 hours why you left why you didn't send
[2:40:45.240 --> 2:40:50.600]  in your support base I just said what happened that night it's a disgrace and it's what a dog
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:55.640]  but he's a narcissist he's a sociopath what what else do you expect and people are I hope now are
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:59.080]  starting to see that I think more people are that are mirror of the road starting to see
[2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:02.600]  how narcissistic he is and he's going to try to rewrite history but it's not going to happen I'm
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:06.280]  not going to let him do it especially not in Benghazi because I did lose friends that night we
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:11.880]  did try to sacrifice ourselves we did to make sure others came home and Ronan did Ronan but
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:16.440]  did sacrifice himself they gave the ultimate sacrifice and you don't you don't uh you don't
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:21.000]  integrate that you don't treat that as a negative uh Barak Hussein Obama and say it didn't happen
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.720]  when guys did gave it their lives because you didn't you didn't feel like doing anything but
[2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:32.120]  there's so many levels to this he is a jerk with Hillary that left you there for 13 hours and I've
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:35.480]  talked to a lot of folks like colonel Schaefer and others evidence that they knew what was going on
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:39.880]  we're trying to get the weapons to al Qaeda and ISIS which we has now been basically confirmed so
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:44.520]  let's just say it everybody else stood down ran off you guys didn't get the word it refuses to
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:49.000]  stand down they sent people there to kill everybody it didn't work so here's the guy that bare
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:53.960]  minimum through negligence almost got you guys killed got some of your buddies killed and then
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:59.160]  he's going to rub it in and say it didn't happen it didn't because they easily manipulated are
[2:41:59.160 --> 2:42:04.040]  going to try to believe they're going to believe him if you don't have any any sort of common sense
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:08.120]  you're you're going to believe what your messiah says and then a lot of people still hold him in
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:13.240]  that regard um I love Donald Trump Jr when he said he helped he did support me on and he said yeah
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:19.000]  he Barak Obama is negligent homicide you know it was um and you know that this is a blessing
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  with us getting banned because now it's waking people up to what's actually going on and we
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:27.320]  just got to keep fighting fighting a good fight brother that's all we can do and and and and if
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:31.160]  he says something like that again I'll come out and say it and I'll report in kind again
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:36.680]  and and put him in his place that's what needs to be done well they started telling us you better

[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:01.720]  about three years and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying and they said
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:06.840]  oh we want more money more money and oh this and that and so i've broken my contract and right now

[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:34.600]  republicans we're in a band you mean we got the messages we didn't back down they banned us it's
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:40.440]  totally blown up in their face and now google's under investigation facebook is apple again it's
[2:47:40.440 --> 2:47:46.280]  moved to china uh both those companies won't work with the pentagon on ai but they're giving the
[2:47:46.280 --> 2:47:51.880]  chinese military our ai but when we all know garpus set up google i'm i'm a free market guy when you're
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.040]  free market but these companies are operating a lot of them are bigger than major nations their gdp
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:48:01.320]  like like a foreign army allied with foreign enemies that are authoritarian and i just think
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:06.760]  we need to have serious move on these folks i can tell people the white house and uh patriots of
[2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:11.640]  this government are looking at it i was in congress last week and saw senator cotton talk about you
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:15.560]  know does uh google need to get swat teamed because i mean the stuff they're doing is not just a
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:21.240]  censorship but they just rampant working with dictators and then moving to china it's it really
[2:48:21.240 --> 2:48:27.240]  gets me concerned uh this is again more the administration and and and mr cotton of course
[2:48:27.240 --> 2:48:32.600]  senator senator congressman cotton senator cotton senator cotton gentlemen like that need to stay on
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:37.960]  the ball like they are um as far as utilizing force with these companies that's a hey that's
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:43.800]  that's higher levels in me i i used to do that i don't do that anymore um well i'm not calling for
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:49.560]  that i'm saying what will we do in 1939 we found out hitler had taken control of all our major
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:48:54.280]  companies and was censoring americans and telling us how hitler we would we would go to those companies
[2:48:54.280 --> 2:48:59.240]  and tell his executives knock it off right now instead have you seen where google took this year
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:03.320]  yeah told the pentagon we're not helping you with anything okay and then they ran over and are working
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:09.080]  with the chinese government if we could get and we got a good president that can handle this i really
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:13.400]  believe you can it's just we need to get high just sessions needs to go brother if we can get
[2:49:13.400 --> 2:49:17.720]  somebody within the uh as far as within the justice department that has a set of balls that
[2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:23.240]  will do something then then we can start to move forward but by you seeing it by me seeing it by
[2:49:23.240 --> 2:49:27.160]  the general property to see it don't think donald trump doesn't see a president trump doesn't see it
[2:49:27.160 --> 2:49:31.080]  we're moving forward in that direction and by you continually talking about it we continue to
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:35.240]  take the fight to them and that's all we can do we can only do that until the president says you
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:39.720]  know what this is what i have this is black and white it's not subjective this is objective what
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:43.640]  they're doing they're being treated to write espionage we're gonna take it we're gonna go
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:47.960]  ahead and and deal with them accordingly based off our justice system based off the constitution
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:52.200]  of what they shouldn't be doing by the way i was told this by high-level sources the pentagon and in
[2:49:52.200 --> 2:49:56.920]  the white house last week and i said it last week when i see it it's not five top engineers
[2:49:56.920 --> 2:50:03.720]  hundreds have left over this and it's in mainstream news today that their top engineer quit a bolson
[2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:07.720]  and said you are aiding and abetting an authoritarian regime rounding up and killing their people
[2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:14.200]  he said this is treason and so more and more and then you've got john carrey secretly meeting
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:20.920]  with the iranians to undermine our our government that that's illegal if i went to iran outside and
[2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:26.600]  tried to negate us policy i couldn't do that here as a citizen i can't go to iran i go under the
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:32.440]  prison yeah if these guys these these politicians they all feel like they're above the law because
[2:50:32.440 --> 2:50:39.320]  the last eight years maybe in the last 16 years and um if they would be held accountable this would
[2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:45.240]  stop one of them be held accountable this would stop um that's where again where i talk about
[2:50:45.240 --> 2:50:49.240]  jeff sessions needs to go we got to get somebody in the jeff's department that has had some balls
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:53.640]  has some teeth that's willing to take it through these people until then you're still going to see
[2:50:53.640 --> 2:50:58.280]  a lot of these politicians these liberal politicians undermine the united states of america and we're
[2:50:58.280 --> 2:51:02.120]  seeing it you're just pointing it out but by asking you to point it out we're still taking
[2:51:02.120 --> 2:51:06.280]  the fight to them and that's what we have to do to stay positive to keep doing it it's necessary
[2:51:06.280 --> 2:51:10.280]  well chris i agree and i think because of the lawlessness and of the above the law arrogance
[2:51:10.280 --> 2:51:14.840]  these companies are crazy i mean i read the stuff they're doing that's admitted i can't even believe
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:20.040]  it and i didn't even know they were having hearings uh specifically admitting that china's taking over
[2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:23.480]  i was actually pleased here's some of the committee talking about that and we only have a few
[2:51:23.480 --> 2:51:27.320]  minutes left please come back for full 30 minutes an hour soon you go to finish teaching your class
[2:51:27.320 --> 2:51:33.240]  but other points you'd like to add to the listeners the viewers uh just about you know the other
[2:51:33.240 --> 2:51:37.400]  survivors have been gosy what they thought of obama saying nothing happened to you you don't exist
[2:51:38.040 --> 2:51:43.480]  well i of course take one on fox and and he he retorted as well it we all are pissed we all
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:48.280]  get angry uh and i don't want because i don't bother boons out there teaching right now um
[2:51:48.280 --> 2:51:53.960]  every one of us you know every one of us gets pissed off about every one of us wants to tell it to
[2:51:53.960 --> 2:52:01.560]  his face say hey you know what stop just shut your mouth obama stop talking about it um so all
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:06.520]  we but we got to stay positive gotta keep fighting gotta keep moving forward and i've said it a million
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:11.640]  times um because the only way we can win this fight is by continually pointing out the corruption
[2:52:11.640 --> 2:52:16.280]  and the liberal hypocrisy and the left lies and the corporations that are under their umbrella
[2:52:16.280 --> 2:52:23.000]  that are lying for them like twitter like google like like apple and and hopefully which i'm seeing
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:27.400]  i think so i'm seeing it the american public will will voice uh their displeasure with it and
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:33.160]  president will take a bonus back to to correct these groups and bring them to justice bring
[2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:39.640]  these diplomats gotta start bringing diplomats in these these ex politicians like john carrey that
[2:52:39.640 --> 2:52:43.800]  are that are are doing things illegally and violating national security like hillary clinton
[2:52:43.800 --> 2:52:47.720]  who violated national security and holding him accountable make an example out of them and it
[2:52:47.720 --> 2:52:51.480]  will stop that's right chris talking from dot com i know you gotta go in five minutes this is a
[2:52:51.480 --> 2:52:55.000]  three-minute break i want to ask you a one-minute question when come back have you seen the video
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:53:01.080]  thousands of illegals and camouflaged with guns on horseback coming across into the us and is this
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:04.520]  not an example of why we need the military on the border which is in the constitution we back
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:09.160]  with that final question with chris cotton ferranto his website chrison ferranto dot com i'm alex
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:19.320]  johns globalism is treason globalism is espionage not being a world citizen i'm all for that i'm
[2:53:19.320 --> 2:53:25.080]  all for internationalism people working together globalism is a world system of control taking
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:30.040]  nation-state power away and transferring it to a quote global technocracy that's in the words of
[2:53:30.040 --> 2:53:34.040]  the devils group themselves they had a vote five years ago and said we are a technocracy
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:41.560]  and we believe the abolishment of elected leaders we want technocrats in place so i'm saying i'm
[2:53:41.560 --> 2:53:44.840]  all for not having government regulation i'm libertarian but when you have big corporations
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:51.560]  working with dictatorships like china to destroy our free speech to sell us out this is about survival
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:55.400]  i don't want to take google over and help the state run i want to have it taken over and then be
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:54:01.000]  transparent and and not be working with dictatorships just don't and again it's one thing to move
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:04.040]  there and work with dictatorships that's bad enough once you start trying to make america
[2:54:04.040 --> 2:54:08.200]  dictatorship as their own engineers say that's when you jump the shark uh he said his teams just

[2:56:25.800 --> 2:56:30.760]  we're up against and they want to quote me on that or use that as a talking point fine but as
[2:56:30.760 --> 2:56:35.480]  people are seeing now essentially that is what we're up against right now it's just pure evil
[2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:42.680]  you're evil what do you make of the way they call the president of nazi and they say remove him
[2:56:42.680 --> 2:56:49.080]  25th amendment and he says lying fake news his enemy of the people and then they lie and go he
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:53.000]  says the first amendment's the enemy of the people he's not censoring media they're the ones
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:57.880]  censoring all of us and calling him for him to be removed and calling for his kids to be kidnapped
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:02.120]  and raped and then he says stop lying about me you're the enemy of the people when you lie
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:05.800]  then they lie again and say that he's against the first amendment these people are incredible
[2:57:05.800 --> 2:57:11.560]  how much they lie it's just crazy it's it and it's all they got and and some people out there are
[2:57:11.560 --> 2:57:15.720]  still believing what they what they're selling so they're they're still they're still believing all
[2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:21.320]  that poop they're selling to him out there um but as you said and i said and i always said earlier
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:27.160]  here this is a win with them what they did to me by by suspending me fine suspending from twitter

[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:48.600]  country club i moved out to the suburbs and uh it's in greenwich canada kit and i played golf
[3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:52.120]  with the president i was like you know what i want my kids to socialize and it seems like
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:56.760]  these country clubs i just moved from the city after 25 years are the only place your kids can
[3:00:56.760 --> 3:01:01.880]  fraternize i could drink anywhere under a bridge with a bum but if it's good for the kids we'll
[3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:08.440]  join the club and i just heard through the grapevine that uh someone had found out i
[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:13.800]  want to join the club and they go so you got your get you got alex jones coming over to your club now
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:19.720]  i'm alex jones you see and that's used as a metaphor to mean crazy people take that stupid

[3:01:27.400 --> 3:01:32.440]  why would you do that's the worst thing about millennials is wearing a wool hat it's in a hot
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:38.520]  studio here it's about 85 degrees and the first thing he does is go i better put on a winter hat
[3:01:38.520 --> 3:01:45.080]  because it's so hot in here nice logic millennials you're so vain and when i say you i mean your
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:51.320]  entire generation is so vain that you want to cook yourself just to give your hair sort of that
[3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:56.600]  oomphie slightly straighter bedhead it's almost kind of anti-semitic by the way because you hate
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:01.000]  curly hair and you want your hair to be straight and anglo-saxon i want to look professional because
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:05.880]  it looks oh it looks so professional put on a make america great again hat that's professional
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:13.960]  get their ass hanging under their pants they wear these damn shower shoes i've seen kids swim
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:19.880]  in shower shoes what the hell is going on there ankle socks and shower shoes are you
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:27.000]  a rich person in jail they play basketball in these stupid shoes it's infuriating and they
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:33.080]  wear a sort of Gucci and Prada they want all the hottest brands they basically live like Rob
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:39.080]  Kardashian's ex stripper wife there whatever her name is black china your whole generation
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:45.640]  is black china i hope you're proud of yourself anyway sorry we got off track there but um
[3:02:46.520 --> 3:02:50.360]  i just i know that's a silly little anecdotal story about my life and i sound like a douche
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:55.000]  talking about the country club but the fact that that guy said so you got alex joins alex
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:01.720]  jones joining your club now and i the president told me this and i found out later that uh the guy
[3:03:01.720 --> 3:03:07.320]  who said that doesn't even go to that particular club i'm i'm a city guy i've moved out in 1988
[3:03:07.320 --> 3:03:11.960]  i haven't lived in the burbs since 1988 so i'm new to all this but apparently there's rivalries
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:17.960]  with clubs like this one is more waspy this one is more jewish this one is more italian catholic
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:24.120]  Protestant they all have their little silly rivalries it's embarrassing really um and this
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:29.880]  guy was trying to sabotage my application because i'm an info wars guy and to that i say a what's
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:33.960]  the matter with alex jones i know it's weird to be on the alex jones show talk about alex jones but
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:41.720]  it came up and b why are you trying to sabotage someone else's social life there is this intense
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:46.360]  pariah status going around with anyone who might be right wing now i was just booted off twitter
[3:03:47.240 --> 3:03:51.880]  and it is it's it's like macartheism although macartheism was justified it's more like the
[3:03:51.880 --> 3:03:58.120]  Salem witch hunts where the witches are looking for aren't witches and the the amount of of of
[3:03:58.120 --> 3:04:03.960]  hubris and and uh intervention that these people are utilizing to sabotage someone else's life
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:09.320]  and not just someone else's life my kids it's their social life it'll be affected us old
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:14.680]  guys don't care about socialize we know who our best friend is whoever's sitting there at the bar
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:19.480]  hey how about the Mets last night i hate the Mets oh okay well i like the Mets we're still friends
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:23.240]  by the way i'll still talk to that guy for 10 minutes he's a Yankees guy i'm a Mets guy
[3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:27.800]  he can crap on the Mets the whole time i just had my friendship for the week i'm good full up to the
[3:04:27.800 --> 3:04:35.720]  brim but little kids they need friends and i'm becoming a pariah in the burbs and it just it
[3:04:35.720 --> 3:04:43.480]  disturbs me that anyone cares why does the left care so much about right wingers personal lives
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:51.400]  about their their friendships and their their romances and their country clubs it's insane
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:56.840]  we come back when we discuss this much more we knew it was coming the whole thing was for me leg
[3:04:56.840 --> 3:05:03.080]  first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man then sue us to add credibility to that
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:07.800]  then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook with nebulous terms like bullying

[3:06:16.520 --> 3:06:26.120]  by the way there's going to be a lot of errors over the next hour i'm new i'm trying remember
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:32.040]  those those horribly sadistic ends that they make people in the service industry where i'm new but
[3:06:32.040 --> 3:06:38.600]  i'm trying i just want to bitch about the suburbs a little bit more because we we live out here and
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:43.320]  we pay very little i'm not in the burbs now i'm in the city of my studio but we i live out in the
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:49.320]  burbs hey tons of money and taxes and it's mostly to get away from urban life and obama and the left
[3:06:49.320 --> 3:06:53.400]  sees that as racist oh you want to get away from black people uh there's a lot of black people
[3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:58.520]  in canada kit and they want to get away from the hood too they want the better education so when
[3:06:58.520 --> 3:07:04.680]  obama enforces these are the diversity quotas in uh and and subsidized housing middle class black
[3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:09.640]  people are going what are you doing i busted my ass to get out of there i started my own
[3:07:09.640 --> 3:07:14.920]  construction company to get out of there and now you're making these schools worse but i find that
[3:07:14.920 --> 3:07:22.200]  the less diverse a neighborhood is the more they cherish the diversity and in canada kit they have
[3:07:22.200 --> 3:07:27.720]  like the local bar lets the old black guy drink for free and everyone is so trepidatious about
[3:07:27.720 --> 3:07:34.200]  anyone who might be conservative because that might be racist and you think racism isn't a thing so
[3:07:34.200 --> 3:07:39.400]  why are you so obsessed with it there's so many other pariahs out there like you think of that guy
[3:07:39.400 --> 3:07:44.360]  from uh seinfeld careers over because he swore he said the n word a bunch of times and that is a bad
[3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:50.520]  word don't get me wrong it's it's up there with the c word as one of the top bad words there is
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:56.680]  but your career is over because you swore i don't understand it how about we recalibrate
[3:07:58.680 --> 3:08:03.960]  the pariah machine it's aimed at the wrong person how about we found out some guy works
[3:08:03.960 --> 3:08:09.560]  at perdu pharmaceuticals now we all know the slacker family right richard no it's sackler
[3:08:09.560 --> 3:08:15.160]  richard sackler is the patriarch of the sackler family and basically this entire opioid epidemic
[3:08:15.160 --> 3:08:21.800]  can be traced back to this one man and his incredibly rich billionaire family perdu
[3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:28.360]  pharmaceuticals makes oxy cotton and they had all kinds of incentives there for doctors to push it
[3:08:28.360 --> 3:08:34.440]  on their patients oh you stopped your dough here's some heroin uh i feel a lot better dude
[3:08:36.520 --> 3:08:41.080]  and we've all seen like the the cashiers nodding out as they're giving out change
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:45.880]  they're not punk rockers from the 70s this isn't a seditious problem anymore this isn't
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:51.480]  johnny thunders and the heartbreakers this isn't lou reed taking a walk on the wild side this is
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:09:00.360]  your dad and more importantly this is your son your son is going to die because of this opioid
[3:09:00.360 --> 3:09:07.800]  epidemic and it is pure corruption big pharma is incentivizing this and naive corrupt incompetent
[3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:12.600]  evil doctors this is not true of all doctors but there seems to be a lot a lot of them
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:16.440]  hell of a lot of them that are willing to uh that are hypocritical about the
[3:09:16.440 --> 3:09:21.960]  apocratic oath become the hypocritical oath now and they're pushing this on the on these people
[3:09:21.960 --> 3:09:27.960]  these these normal americans these ohio farmers these these little rich kids rich kids and poor
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:33.000]  kids are all dying in equal numbers now it's it's the one great unifier we have in this country now
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:39.560]  is the sackler's war on americans and so the guy does oxy right you know the story as a sore back
[3:09:39.560 --> 3:09:44.280]  he gets addicted to the painkillers and then they become too expensive to buy illegally after his
[3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:51.960]  prescription runs out so he hears of this thing called heroin you mean a female hero yeah it's
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:56.280]  the same word it's spelled different oh how much is it it's about a hundred bucks for a bundle
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:10:03.080]  a bundle last you a month yes please so now we have suburban junkies rural junkies and who
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:06.600]  supplies them the heroin well there's another convenient thing the globalists have set up for
[3:10:06.600 --> 3:10:12.680]  us open borders so now we have heroin pouring over the border and ms-13 happy to dole it out
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:19.000]  over in long island just up the road for me it's a slightly less affluent suburb they have murders
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:26.200]  all the time gang murders because ms-13 is vying for different territories you know what's crazy
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:32.440]  i just remember this right now remember that black woman who was there for trump's inauguration
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:36.840]  and he brought her up and he said this this woman just had her daughter murdered by ms-13
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:42.360]  and everyone cried and we saw the couple i just read the other day that she was killed you know how
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:48.760]  she was killed the woman who they had a shrine to this this poor woman's daughter and the and
[3:10:48.760 --> 3:10:53.960]  the woman who owns the property there decided that that was hurting her sales she couldn't
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:59.000]  sell her home because too many people were bawling their eyes at her doorstep so she picked it all up
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:03.560]  and threw it in her suv and then the mother of the victim goes hey can you not pick up all these
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:09.400]  candles and pictures of my daughter so the woman ran her over and killed her this is the america
[3:11:09.400 --> 3:11:16.280]  we're living in now mourning mothers being run over by another angry i don't know what what her
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:23.320]  background was but i'm assuming it's bad so anyway i bring up all of this to say how about you find
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:28.040]  out someone at perdu pharmaceuticals uh lives down the street and how about there's some
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:34.200]  some whispering about him i see it in my neighborhood i see whispers all the time
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:36.280]  sometimes i'll be walking down the street and i'll see a house where i just go
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:43.400]  oh like she's finally seen the Hannibal Lecter walk by just oh my god and what is the
[3:11:43.400 --> 3:11:48.360]  horror the horror is that i like trump and if i like trump i might be conservative and
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:55.240]  i'm being linked to um charlottesville which i disavowed like a maniac but the owner the guy who
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:00.680]  ran it had been stalking me so we must be friends and i must have organized it just the fact that
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:05.560]  i disavowed it'd be damned and it got me thinking i'm sorry to talk about myself so much but you'll
[3:12:05.560 --> 3:12:10.200]  be in the same boat one day first they came for me they're coming for you next i blame soros for
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:15.720]  all of this soros is terrorizing me and trying to shut down my fraternal club the proud boys
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:21.320]  and he's paying people to mess with my life and spread these lies about me spread fake news now
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:26.360]  that sounds paranoid and you go gavin that's mental patient o'clock what are you talking about
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:31.320]  he's he's sitting there with his little checkbook going out and paying people no it's not that
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:37.240]  covert in fact i think these murders linked to hillary are not as simple as her saying go and
[3:12:37.240 --> 3:12:43.720]  kill uh what's his name rich what's his name again i forgot seth rich go and kill seth rich
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:48.200]  no no no she might not have even known about the murder of seth rich i think there's a sort of a
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:53.320]  machine that started in 92 with the clintons getting rid of people who got in the way and it's
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:59.160]  sort of spiraled out of control and she's just like oh they killed seth rich oh great oh great
[3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:04.120]  here we go i just wanted vince foster's stuff messed with this is totally out of control you
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:09.080]  guys and they're like this is glinn you you're putting in a very difficult situation maybe you
[3:13:09.080 --> 3:13:13.400]  should just keep your mouth shut and i don't think george soros is going oh we killed someone else i
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:18.040]  think this is what happened with soros he's a billionaire right and he hates the fact that
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:22.680]  he spilled the beans in his own books about working with the nazis and in his own books
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:27.880]  he basically said i was a paper boy who would go door to door and say this house has jews this
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:31.720]  house has jews hey jews you should leave are you gonna get killed hey jews get out of here
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:36.200]  that was his thing he put the notice on your door but instead of saying we're having a sale at pennies
[3:13:36.200 --> 3:13:41.880]  it said we're going to kill you um and when he talked about it on 60 minutes he said it was
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:46.040]  the greatest time of my life i don't regret it was fun and then he went that was probably not great
[3:13:46.040 --> 3:13:53.400]  pr so now he's changed it to i was hiding i was alone and my father his father by the way was a
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:58.680]  total globalist atheist didn't just hate religious people but he was an anti-semite he was a jewish
[3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:03.800]  anti-semite and he was not a fan of of any religious people at all in fact he wants us all to be
[3:14:03.800 --> 3:14:09.000]  atheist and he wants the whole globe he wanted he's dead he wanted the whole globe to speak that
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:15.560]  esperanto language power babel stuff anyway so he sits down with his pr people and he goes
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:20.840]  i gotta kill this hitler thing it's looking real i don't know if you know this but nazis have a bad
[3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:25.400]  rep what should i do and his people said all right here's what we do we change the story to
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:30.600]  you're a holocaust survivor and you had to go to these places or they would have killed you and you
[3:14:30.600 --> 3:14:34.360]  were in disguise your little kid you had no idea it was doing you're only 14 and you were crying
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:38.760]  the whole time and and you were just sort of like a deer in the headlights the whole time and he goes
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:45.080]  love it okay what about the truth though and they go oh we'll just we'll use lawfare and fake news
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:50.440]  and we'll terrorize anyone who brings up the truth of what really happened and hurts this whole
[3:14:50.440 --> 3:14:55.400]  holocaust survivor narrative that you have going for you and he goes thanks sounds good sign off on
[3:14:55.400 --> 3:15:01.800]  it bye that i think is the end for soros and now the bots the staff they're out there like ezra
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:09.240]  levant wrote an article about george soros where he brought all this up and curiously enough shortly
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:15.640]  after that ezra levant has been battling ridiculous lawsuit after ridiculous lawsuit from people who
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:21.400]  would normally have no money like teachers suing him because he said this that is tangentially
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:26.520]  related to their profession and i'm looking at these court cases and i go ezra this is lawfare
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:31.160]  someone is behind this and i honestly believe it was the thing that started a long time ago with
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:35.880]  that article which since been taken down by the way that 600 word article and i think i'm going
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:41.560]  through the same thing i think i'm part of this this sort of computer virus that the source machine
[3:15:41.560 --> 3:15:46.120]  sort of sends out in the system to mess with your life and that's what the kids like of course

[3:20:16.360 --> 3:20:27.880]  and we're back back to gavin mckinnis filling in for alex jones and uh treating you like my
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:32.840]  psychiatrist i'm lying on the couch here bitching about the sort of pariah status that has been
[3:20:32.840 --> 3:20:38.440]  imbued upon me and the reason it's relevant to your life is i believe that this is can be traced
[3:20:38.440 --> 3:20:43.560]  back to soros i'm obviously not saying that he sits there writing a cheque saying kareis gavin i
[3:20:43.560 --> 3:20:47.800]  wouldn't be surprised if he has no idea who i am but i think in the cases of hillary clinton
[3:20:47.800 --> 3:20:52.440]  and george soros all these horrible things that happened was started by a domino they pushed long
[3:20:52.440 --> 3:20:57.560]  ago i wouldn't be surprised if i wouldn't be surprised if hillary clinton's people murdered
[3:20:57.560 --> 3:21:03.080]  seth rich and she didn't know that it happened i believe that she was complicit in murders
[3:21:03.080 --> 3:21:08.520]  in the early nineties with uh all of blinton's various various mistresses you keep there's so
[3:21:08.520 --> 3:21:15.080]  many murders of a woman like that his translator his deaf sign woman he was definitely sleeping
[3:21:15.080 --> 3:21:19.240]  with i shouldn't say definitely i'm convinced he was sleeping with and and she was rob when she
[3:21:19.240 --> 3:21:24.280]  worked at starbucks after she quit they shot her in the head and taking any money or or her chef
[3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:30.280]  who drowned face down in a creek while camping i mean go look it up and i was kind of cynical too
[3:21:30.280 --> 3:21:36.600]  about her the things she did but there's about 40 and i always say to libel's like okay i get
[3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:43.640]  that sounds crazy right where's obama's list you know where obama's chef is he's making a blt
[3:21:43.640 --> 3:21:48.920]  right now he's alive you know where uh this woman who was seen with obama late at night is
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:54.200]  she's picking her nose right now at the gym waiting to use the treadmill she's alive
[3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:57.880]  all these people around the obamas you got to use the obamas too so they can't handle any other
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:03.720]  kind of metaphor uh they're all fine george w bush's chef is fine it's just this one person
[3:22:03.720 --> 3:22:12.600]  that has this long list of curious deaths um and so that i think it's the same with soros i think
[3:22:12.600 --> 3:22:15.960]  he had a meeting a long time ago and said terrorize anyone who brings up that nazi thing make their
[3:22:15.960 --> 3:22:21.720]  lives hell make sure they can't work at a country club make sure that that they're known as alex
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:26.040]  jones and make sure alex jones has stigma too he talks about me all the time i want his children
[3:22:26.040 --> 3:22:31.160]  to have trouble in school i want his daughter's tutor like my daughter's tutor recently quit
[3:22:31.160 --> 3:22:37.240]  because of my politics and the thing i was saying earlier is i wish it could be for something
[3:22:37.240 --> 3:22:41.960]  that i actually believe or i wish i could be an actual bad guy like if you work at Purdue
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:46.920]  pharmaceuticals you should be a pariah your children i don't know i shouldn't say your
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:50.440]  children should suffer that's insane but if anyone's going to be a pariah should be someone
[3:22:50.440 --> 3:22:57.080]  involved in big pharma someone who whose job actually does lead to death and these bad guys
[3:22:57.080 --> 3:23:01.960]  that they have these so-called racists and nazis whatever like richard spencer his he's not me
[3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:09.960]  okay obviously but even him his his beliefs don't lead to deaths i mean can't you be mad at actual
[3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:14.280]  bad guys can't you terrorize actual bad guys so sorry i've got too many threads running at once
[3:23:14.280 --> 3:23:21.960]  you but the soros thing i think so he his little bots and i picture them as kind of a females i
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:26.520]  picture them as lesbians that they're in law and i i think they're the ones who dole out like the
[3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:30.760]  money for this blm stuff and all that and he's just like go ahead handle it i don't want to hear
[3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:37.240]  about it i'm busy in my jacuzzi so uh i think charles phillis been pinned to me quite a bit
[3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:40.120]  and i was very adamant from the beginning i don't want anything to do with this now jason
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:44.680]  kesler he's the guy who organized it jason kesler kept trying to join my group the power
[3:23:44.680 --> 3:23:49.960]  problems he went to two different things showed up he seemed nice hey we did our little ritual and
[3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:55.080]  then i mean both times that we started to smell a rat kicked him out he called me regularly it was
[3:23:55.080 --> 3:24:00.840]  very friendly and said i'm just a guy who likes statues and me too i i also think statues shouldn't
[3:24:00.840 --> 3:24:06.040]  be torn down so we bonded on that i said are you all right he said no absolutely not lied about it
[3:24:06.040 --> 3:24:12.120]  right and the charles phillis thing was pushed as a let's stop taking statues down thing and
[3:24:12.120 --> 3:24:15.720]  the statues thing is getting ridiculous in my home country of canada they just took down a
[3:24:15.720 --> 3:24:21.800]  sir john a mcdonald statue what because they're the way he treated the indians we tried hugging
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:27.960]  them they killed us you got to play rough i'm afraid if you want to stay alive 300 years ago
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  anyway uh i smelled a rat anyway and i said you know what jason i don't trust you you're out of
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:39.240]  the pro boys you've got nothing to do with us and this is like two months before i said we're not
[3:24:39.240 --> 3:24:43.880]  going anyone who goes is evil i disavow disavow disavow and then he called me i remember it's on
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:48.760]  the beach it was during the summer and he was panicking saying you you got to come we'll pay
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:53.000]  for your flight look this is just about stat statues we need to unite blah blah blah blah
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  and portrayed as a wonderful thing and i said to him i remember this vividly i got mad because
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:00.520]  he was so adamant about it you know he just wouldn't take no for an answer i said look dude
[3:25:00.520 --> 3:25:06.200]  i fought nazis in the 80s we had a rock against racism concerts i had my events where i was out
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:09.640]  there busting my ass and on the phone making sure this guy's gonna come this out that guy's gonna
[3:25:09.640 --> 3:25:14.520]  come i've done all that now i'm with my family in the summer i don't want to hear about your event
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:20.040]  you go have your event it's none of my beeswax and he seemed panicked by that whereas anyone
[3:25:20.040 --> 3:25:25.000]  else is organizing a thing goes oh you can't go okay next on the list of of who can do it
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:34.280]  and i'm convinced in retrospect that charlotte's phil is a fake thing it was set up by soros lackeys
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:41.080]  to discredit the right to get rid of people like that were near the edge like milo unopolis and
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:46.520]  lauren southern to get us in there and mix us with the nazis who hate us by the way and then
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:50.760]  discredit us all and we'll be done and i do believe a lot of those guys with tiki tortures
[3:25:50.760 --> 3:25:54.440]  were real guys i went when they were saying blood and so on all that nazi stuff i believe they
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:26:00.360]  believe that i think a lot of them are autistic weirdos and uh i think it backfired i think whoever
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:05.720]  was in charge whatever globalist lefty group was in charge of setting up charlotte's phil and jason
[3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:13.880]  castler by the way was an occupy wall street democrat uh i think whoever set that up got fired
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:19.320]  it was it didn't turn out we only got one death shit we didn't want that we wanted
[3:26:19.320 --> 3:26:24.680]  we wanted total and utter chaos much more racism it didn't go but they still cling to that one
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:29.320]  heather higher death which even that is starting to sound dubious obviously think she was killed
[3:26:29.320 --> 3:26:34.360]  that's horrible horrific terrible but some things that no one talks about with that death one
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:41.560]  why is a girl in flip flops going to what she sees as and what turned out to be a gigantic nazi
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:48.040]  rally like i think ms-13 is a scourge if they were having a gathering i'm a pretty good fighter i box
[3:26:48.040 --> 3:26:54.520]  three days a week the idea that i would just march in and go hey not on my watch ms-13 you're out of
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:27:01.080]  here buster i'm scared of ms-13 i'm scared of gangs i don't go up to the mongols and i'm not
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:04.360]  going to say anything bad about them even as a metaphor because i'd hate that to be taken out
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:11.080]  of context because they're dangerous dudes so why is your daughter going there that's a b we've had
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:18.040]  this professor bragging about how he chased the guy who ran her over whatever his name was james
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:23.720]  den levy or something i forget his name uh terrorized him scared him with a shotgun so he got in his
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:28.360]  car and we've also seen footage of them bashing in his car smashing windows freaking him out
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:36.040]  so this whole thing was a complete mess and i think it's something much more sinister
[3:27:36.040 --> 3:27:43.240]  than it's made out to be and and by the way also for the record uh this was the worst they got right
[3:27:43.240 --> 3:27:49.000]  it took all this maniacal planning and lies and deception and pretendings about statues
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:54.600]  and they managed to scrounge up what 200 guys what is the population of america what do we
[3:27:54.600 --> 3:28:02.120]  have like 360 million you basically are showing as a threat that is not even close to as dangerous as
[3:28:02.120 --> 3:28:09.240]  elevators wait we lose six americans a year to spider bites your enemy even in your worst
[3:28:09.240 --> 3:28:15.080]  case scenario even if we ignore my theory that it was a fake rally even all that you're still in the
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:26.040]  elevator measles spider is kind of an area of danger whereas big pharma 40 000 a year 36 000 a
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:33.160]  year to be specific that's 115 people a day dying from opioids from from uh that one that killed
[3:28:33.160 --> 3:28:39.080]  prince and and and oxy and heroin all of those combined 115 a day yet those guys aren't pariahs
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:45.400]  no the mythical nazi that's the pariah if you are obsessed with chasing nazis and white supremacists
[3:28:45.400 --> 3:28:52.280]  you are essentially a bigfoot chaser bigfoot is not a thing we give you a lot more things to

[3:32:51.960 --> 3:33:01.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:01.960 --> 3:33:11.960]  so
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:23.960]  why do i bring all this stuff um because we have to understand that the left is not playing fair
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:29.080]  they are playing to win they have no interest in truth no interest in justice this is just
[3:33:29.080 --> 3:33:37.480]  just trump has to go if they can honestly believe i would say 40 of the dnc of democrats if they
[3:33:37.480 --> 3:33:43.880]  could push a button where trump would suffer a debilitating horrible way to die flesh eating
[3:33:43.880 --> 3:33:47.640]  disease and they could watch it i bet they would push that button we're up against basically
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:53.800]  gargamel from the smurfs we're up against a bad guy and i was thinking the other day
[3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:59.320]  say can say hillary won and it was discovered that canada had meddled in the elections what do
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:05.400]  you think the left would be doing today they'd be saying ha ha suckers oh sore losers what's
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:10.600]  the matter you know the last thing they would do would be even considering impeachment they would
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:14.520]  be laughing at our faces and that's one thing that bugs me about the right we're so determined to
[3:34:14.520 --> 3:34:21.160]  play fair and be nice and no here's the proof look no here's the document i did here's my evidence
[3:34:21.160 --> 3:34:27.400]  they don't do evidence they lie this whole kavinoff thing with this girl who claims it was attempted
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:35.320]  rape and then we find out that she wore a brain shaped pussy hat for a march and signed a petition
[3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:39.480]  trying to get trump to to change his views on immigration or something like that she's a very
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:46.280]  politically active liberal and coincidentally she's just decided right now to accuse kavinoff
[3:34:46.280 --> 3:34:50.680]  some high school sexual encounter now there's one thing the left is going to do here they're
[3:34:50.680 --> 3:34:56.440]  watching us with bated breath dying for us to say something like i just said but much worse they
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:35:02.200]  want trump to go ah forget it she's a liar then they can go on the whole these guys don't care
[3:35:02.200 --> 3:35:07.160]  about rape victims thing and it does well with the female voters you say there's little kids
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:13.240]  there's a baby that crossed the border and he's so hungry no one goes why did a woman bring a baby
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:17.000]  across the border he couldn't have waited till he was a little healthier a little older a little
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:23.560]  tougher why are you bringing kids on a crime spree which by the way that trip that distance that
[3:35:23.560 --> 3:35:30.920]  that whole uh root is a is basically a tough mutter can't uh uh relay race it's brutal and
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:37.000]  you brought a little kid along with you why did you do that anyway they are dying for the right
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:43.240]  especially a supreme court judge to be rash and dismissive with her so that is why you'll notice
[3:35:43.240 --> 3:35:49.000]  uh kelly and conway and everyone on the news is going we want to be clear here we are going to go
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:53.160]  take this to trial make sure we look at all the evidence that's what she needs to be heard
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:35:57.800]  because they can tell it's a setup to try to make you be dismissive but civilians like me can go
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:05.800]  i'm not buying it it stinks um so they're always playing games i think that the law
[3:36:05.800 --> 3:36:13.240]  fair with soros is a game i think the strange deaths around hillary are a game i think that uh the
[3:36:13.240 --> 3:36:18.200]  this whole pretending that you're concerned about russia meddling is all just propaganda tricks and
[3:36:18.200 --> 3:36:24.600]  lies and i think alex jones and i getting kicked off of twitter and getting uh booted off social
[3:36:24.600 --> 3:36:30.600]  media is them saying the game isn't working charlottesville i believe was designed to take down
[3:36:30.600 --> 3:36:36.680]  people like me mylo and lauren it's still linked to me somehow even though i clearly said i don't
[3:36:36.680 --> 3:36:41.960]  want nothing to do with it and the tweet where i said i want nothing to do with this second one
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:46.520]  either is conveniently has disappeared because i'm off twitter and the local media would say
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:52.360]  mckinnis uh booted proud boys founder booted from twitter shortly before unite the right
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:36:57.400]  well technically chronologically yes i guess it was but the implication there is that
[3:36:57.400 --> 3:37:01.560]  so i couldn't sit there and organize unite the right so whatever money whatever globalist money
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:08.760]  went into this myth is still perpetuating even though the the lie failed or did it and i i also
[3:37:08.760 --> 3:37:15.640]  think it's interesting the timing of of when alex and i were persecuted for uh for viable my thing
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:22.040]  i'm hearing now from my lawyers is promoting violence violence is out there okay it's like guns
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:28.520]  guns exist we want good guys to have guns violence exists antifa the sociophascists
[3:37:28.520 --> 3:37:33.720]  are the paramilitary wing of the democratic party and they go to rallies and they beat us
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:40.840]  and they stab us with hammers with knives with gas with them eighties they throw rocks at our heads
[3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:47.560]  they split open our skulls with bike locks my group has said hey uh we're going to defend ourselves
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:54.840]  and god forbid we should enjoy that that became promoting violence so the left is so fascist
[3:37:54.840 --> 3:37:59.800]  that if you don't lie down and take it you're violent i mean what is this this is like stalling
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:05.240]  this is mal this is dictatorship stuff not benevolent dictators tyrannical dictators
[3:38:06.200 --> 3:38:12.280]  and so rufio our buddy rufio is a proud boy he had a beautiful punch for me knocked out an
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:18.760]  antifa so hard the guy was just unconscious and his body was erect just and it was we called the
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:23.080]  punch heard around the world i featured him on my show to talk about the punch alex featured him
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:27.800]  on his show to talk about the punch i was banned shortly after alex was banned shortly after and
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:34.520]  all proud boys accounts were immediately banned right after that why was that because we're glorifying
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:40.280]  violence no because we are a threat to their paramilitary wing because their violence isn't
[3:38:40.280 --> 3:38:45.320]  working you notice antifa's still up on twitter they don't mind alt left violence they don't
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.800]  mind the socio fascist they just mind when we defend ourselves and they tried to do it through
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:54.680]  propaganda and lies to make us look bad it's not working there was just a rally in denver for free
[3:38:54.680 --> 3:39:01.160]  speech these these proud boys grabbed i'm told first hand accounts that antifa jumped on a cop
[3:39:01.880 --> 3:39:06.360]  and these proud boys grabbed the antifa ripped them off the cop and cops love proud boys because
[3:39:06.360 --> 3:39:13.400]  proud boys love cops and he's looking at suspension now because he said to them earlier he said uh
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:16.840]  there was a video going around where he said i know some of you came here to fight i can tell
[3:39:16.840 --> 3:39:21.480]  that by what you're wearing that's not happening today and then he said if you want to fight stick
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:26.280]  around i got a couple guys they also want to fight now that could mean anything that could mean him
[3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:32.040]  and some cops want to have like a fun little spar session or he could mean i got some antifa guys
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:36.360]  that want to fight them we'll let you fight them that no one knows what that means and he also added
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:43.240]  later i'm kidding of course but this is what's going on in this country there is this intense
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:50.040]  scrutiny this fine tooth comb where they go through every facet of a i don't even want to
[3:39:50.040 --> 3:39:55.960]  say conservative of a non-liberal's life where you had slightly rough sex in high school so you can't
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:40:02.920]  be a supreme court judge um you may you knew the guy who organized charlottesville ergo you killed
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:08.520]  heather higher so you have to be terrorized your family social life has to be affected if you know
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:14.920]  alex jones and you who conspiracy theories if you are even open to the idea that the deep state
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:19.800]  exists even though james o' keith is about to prove that you know shadow of a doubt if you're open
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:24.760]  to any of this if you're not a hundred percent with the liberal cause even as the liberal cause
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:30.760]  drifts off into satellite town and has things like infinite gender and children are sexual
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:36.680]  beings and we need to have drag queens read books to kids and children should have hormone blockers
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:42.520]  so they don't they don't suffer puberty and and we're slavery is worse today in america than ever
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:48.520]  before and the president is a white supremacist nazi even as they start saying that crazy radical

[3:47:09.080 --> 3:47:19.560]  hey
[3:47:24.600 --> 3:47:33.320]  hammer back folks don't you forget about me i'll be alone dancing you know it baby
[3:47:33.320 --> 3:47:37.240]  you know what people don't know about the new romantics that that scene in in britain
[3:47:37.240 --> 3:47:43.480]  where you had human league and flock of seagulls and uh simple minds and all those you'd see them
[3:47:43.480 --> 3:47:48.600]  in these white suits put their hair like that you go what a bunch of wimps what a bunch of girly men
[3:47:49.160 --> 3:47:54.200]  no no no no you see that's back when the economy was booming in britain thanks to thatcher's
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:48:00.760]  privatization and blue collar guys were busting their asses in factories all week tough guys
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:06.920]  british men and so when they partied on a friday night they're like i'm going all out mate so with
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:11.720]  the glam they'd have like orange suspenders like elton john looking guys with big sunglasses and a
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:16.200]  funny hat and like big giant boots with big gold stars on the side or they dress up like
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:23.560]  woman and be like hi i'm a leaky look at me guys and they would beat the tarot of you if you had a
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:29.480]  problem with their pink suit so back in 1980 if you saw a guy walking down the street who looked like
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:34.120]  he was in human league you described or what might take it easy thought he'd be drunk out of his mind
[3:48:34.120 --> 3:48:38.280]  because they would party i mean they were they worked hard and they played hard but don't sleep
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:45.400]  on flock of seagulls they were tough believe it or not um so i want to wrap this up with
[3:48:45.400 --> 3:48:50.840]  some optimism but i want to go over my whole sort of hypothesis here which is and i think this is
[3:48:50.840 --> 3:48:54.840]  relevant to mention the alex jones show because from a far a long long time ago i was like oh that's
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:48:59.240]  that crazy guy with those nutty theories and then you start looking into it i wrote an article on
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:05.160]  tacky mag dot com actually about hillary murders and how curious they're and i only focused on the
[3:49:05.160 --> 3:49:11.080]  ones that had a ton of evidence but as you start looking into this stuff you go it's i was listening
[3:49:11.080 --> 3:49:16.440]  to the left narrative where george soros has a big bucket of money and anyone who punches a
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:22.920]  conservative gets a hundred dollars although something that crazy does happen you looked at that uh
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:29.240]  the the uh kavanaugh hearings where we saw a woman getting paid from an envelope or a protester
[3:49:29.240 --> 3:49:36.120]  here's your money lady good job screaming and screwing up this hearing great job um but there's
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:43.800]  a great area in between and soros can be funding lawfare and terrorizing people based on a decision
[3:49:43.800 --> 3:49:49.960]  made years and years ago that says oh uh yes i don't know i don't know how to do george soros's
[3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:56.600]  is accent uh yes um one thing the nazi thing i don't like so have uh anyone who mentioned that
[3:49:56.600 --> 3:50:00.600]  catch them up in stuff give them parking tickets not parking tickets i guess you can do that but
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:06.680]  red pay media matters to to look into it and then really bug them all the time and get some stuff
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:10.840]  but maybe even have a rally where they look bad that's going to be my new george soros no matter
[3:50:10.840 --> 3:50:16.520]  what he actually sounds like for now hey i'm george soros what are you guys doing uh for example
[3:50:16.520 --> 3:50:20.280]  for example here's another thing that i know something fishy is going on someone will put
[3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:25.240]  together a compilation of every time i've said something untowards and just like take the joke
[3:50:25.240 --> 3:50:32.120]  part out so it sounds like a racist thing and that requires watching 700 hours of video now we all
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:37.960]  have enemies but who watches 700 hours of a show i wouldn't i wouldn't watch that 700 hours of alex
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:43.160]  jones you know roe i mean i love the guy i love this show i don't have time for that kind of of
[3:50:43.160 --> 3:50:49.720]  attention and media matters and right wing watch the first every minute of my show who's doing that
[3:50:49.720 --> 3:50:53.560]  i think they're getting a check now it's it's not originally from soros but it'll be from
[3:50:53.560 --> 3:50:58.440]  something like the center for democratic progress or some other name and that group will get a check
[3:50:58.440 --> 3:51:04.040]  from a company called helping americans love again and then that company the company that
[3:51:04.040 --> 3:51:09.400]  gives them money will be called free hugs for everyone eventually it it's completely untraceable
[3:51:09.400 --> 3:51:14.200]  back to soros but he starts this first domino that's not a that's doesn't sound like a conspiracy
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:18.520]  theory to me and a lot of this stuff you can see he admits he reads soros's books and he's very open
[3:51:18.520 --> 3:51:24.600]  about his nazi past unfortunately for him and he's also very open about the billions of dollars he's
[3:51:24.600 --> 3:51:31.320]  poured in over the years to um to various leftist causes and that includes vlm and antifa now antifa
[3:51:31.320 --> 3:51:36.440]  goes oh yeah where's my check sorry dude it's like an indian reservation it doesn't actually make it
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:42.280]  down to the actual people the top brass keeps it all it's just like big government the administrators
[3:51:42.280 --> 3:51:47.560]  they keep the money they make the nice signs that were made at kinkos for you to carry around
[3:51:47.560 --> 3:51:51.720]  you don't get you might get a hundred bucks some of these protesters get a hundred bucks but they
[3:51:51.720 --> 3:51:58.360]  don't get real money so what do you do about all this what do you do about getting fired i can't i
[3:51:58.360 --> 3:52:02.760]  sorry i get so many people to say to me gavin i want to be honest and talk about free speech not be
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:07.960]  racist not be anti-semitic just talk the way my dad talks in bars like a normal person you know what i
[3:52:07.960 --> 3:52:15.000]  mean and not not think that that four-year-olds should be wearing a dress um what do you what the
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:22.600]  hell is that dog doing why did you bring a dog to the studio today anyway um i want to do that but
[3:52:22.600 --> 3:52:29.560]  i might get fired here's my solution to your problem sir get fired i've been fired a million
[3:52:29.560 --> 3:52:34.360]  times i've lost entire careers and i'm still making money because this is america when you put your
[3:52:34.360 --> 3:52:39.160]  nose to the grindstone you make money i'm making more money this year than i've ever made in my life
[3:52:39.800 --> 3:52:46.600]  and that's because i'm just honest and i bust my ass and america rewards those who bust their ass
[3:52:46.600 --> 3:52:51.400]  america punishes those who live in fear and the more you capitulate and the more you apologize
[3:52:51.400 --> 3:52:56.040]  the more you will suffer and that includes monetarily what about that kramer guy you were
[3:52:56.040 --> 3:53:01.320]  talking about who yelled the n word his career is over yes because he capitulated he apologized he
[3:53:01.320 --> 3:53:06.040]  should have been doing stand-up the next night with the world trade center we should have been
[3:53:06.040 --> 3:53:11.480]  rebuilding the towers on september 12th we should have had the the blueprints out from the old towers
[3:53:12.120 --> 3:53:17.080]  dusted them off and recreated the same towers you dust yourself off you get back on top i heard
[3:53:17.080 --> 3:53:22.840]  ben Shapiro whom i admire say that you know uh colleges are are marxist hellholes what should
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:28.040]  i do if i if i don't tow the line the liberal narrative i won't graduate and he said well you
[3:53:28.040 --> 3:53:33.480]  can't uh you can't fail you can't get booted out of college so just tow the line and then make
[3:53:33.480 --> 3:53:39.560]  tons of money and say ha ha at the end i'm rich i was lying i disagree with ben on that i say
[3:53:39.560 --> 3:53:44.520]  write the truth talk about your various conspiracy theories back them up admit that you don't know
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:50.760]  this but you think this uh this there's hard evidence for this there isn't just my gut um and
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:57.720]  then get an f get booted out of college for telling the truth get in trouble you know you don't want
[3:53:57.720 --> 3:54:03.000]  your marriage to fall apart i'm not saying that you you you sit there screaming at dinner parties
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:07.560]  until no one wants to have you and your wife over for dinner i'm not saying be a dog dogmatic bore
[3:54:08.120 --> 3:54:15.560]  but when the time comes to be honest to be yourself to stand up stand up look at tommy robinson he
[3:54:15.560 --> 3:54:21.160]  recognizes there's an islamic scourge in america and this is something i'm glad i still have time to
[3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:27.160]  get to um i was saying earlier that if we're going to aim our pariah machine at someone how about
[3:54:27.160 --> 3:54:31.720]  someone who works at big pharma like produce pharmaceuticals who also by the way own the
[3:54:31.720 --> 3:54:38.200]  patent to the generic uh heroin and also are working on a patent for the cure not the band
[3:54:38.200 --> 3:54:43.320]  the cure to heroin so it's right out of a superman movie where they give you a disease and then they
[3:54:43.320 --> 3:54:48.840]  can make money off the cure um that's one group that deserves the kind of status these non-racist
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:53.800]  keep getting when i say non-racist i mean people are accused of being nazis but another group would
[3:54:53.800 --> 3:55:00.280]  be islam all the things you say about mike pens being homophobic mike pens doesn't throw gays off
[3:55:00.280 --> 3:55:05.480]  buildings all the things you say about trump and his pussy joke being sexist trump isn't pushing for
[3:55:05.480 --> 3:55:11.160]  sharia law where a woman can be beaten if she doesn't have sex with her husband where a woman's
[3:55:11.160 --> 3:55:16.680]  testimony in court is worth half that of a man's you talk about racism all the time because you
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:22.360]  think that guy knew a guy who knew a guy who was in charlottesville islam is steeped in racism
[3:55:22.360 --> 3:55:29.240]  radical islam and moderate islam you know they're still practicing slavery today in north africa
[3:55:29.240 --> 3:55:36.360]  you want to buy a black guy they're 400 bucks in libya shouldn't that bother you just a little bit
[3:55:36.360 --> 3:55:42.600]  so every trope that they heap on innocent men like me and alex and you and mylo and loren and
[3:55:42.600 --> 3:55:48.200]  stefan molyneux and dav rubin and jordan peterson and even joe rogan all of those tropes they heap
[3:55:48.200 --> 3:55:55.320]  on those guys are which don't exist are blindingly obvious when you look at radical islam and no
[3:55:55.320 --> 3:56:02.360]  this is not a racist thing i love me some indians seeks there are so many cultures even mexicans
[3:56:02.360 --> 3:56:07.880]  even hispanics the catholic hispanics do assimilate when they come in in normal numbers
[3:56:07.880 --> 3:56:13.640]  it's the it's the 13 million being heaped on in one big plop that makes it difficult to assimilate
[3:56:13.640 --> 3:56:18.200]  you can almost you almost can't assimilate when you come in a in a group that large it's almost
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:24.520]  unnatural but there's something about islam that seems incongruous with the west and as the left
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:28.600]  doesn't want to talk about it because it sounds racist so they'd rather just invent racist and go
[3:56:28.600 --> 3:56:34.120]  uh you you look like my dad i'm making you the bad guy i'm going to try and ruin your life
