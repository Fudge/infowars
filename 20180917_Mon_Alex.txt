[00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:08.323]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:23.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:28.603]  50 days left, ladies and gentlemen, until one of the most critical elections in world history.
[00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:42.304]  You know, 65 women have come public from high school, college, you name it, in the last 36 years for Brett Kavanaugh, and they've said he was nothing but a gentleman.
[00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:49.788]  Many of them have said they never even saw him drink, that the guy was a complete egghead, a bookworm.
[00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.145]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:00:52.145 --> 00:01:06.440]  We have a Democratic Party operative, an activist leftist professor, whose own students are saying is vicious, hateful and vindictive, coming out six weeks ago secretly when he was first announced.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.088]  Then Dianne Feinstein and others sat on it and waited till the one week recess for the vote.
[00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:20.999]  To roll her out, and guess what they did three weeks ago?
[00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:36.203]  Once she had the Democratic Party operatives with her, and once they'd vetted her for three weeks, they decided we better expunge her social media accounts, which Paul Joseph Watson has in an article he's done.
[00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:40.844]  Very, very, very important information.
[00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.073]  We're going to get into.
[00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:51.259]  The article's titled, Kavanaugh accuser is an anti-Trump leftist who attended Women's March, donated to DNC.
[00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.261]  And it's a great article by Paul.
[00:01:54.261 --> 00:02:00.846]  But quite frankly, we need a new article because what's buried in his article is the most important point.
[00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:08.832]  They expunged all of her social media, but Paul Watson got screenshots off of the Google Archive.
[00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:18.707]  So, one of the great writers around here needs to do a whole story on why did Kavanaugh's accuser erase her social media history.
[00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:24.489]  Because she's a foaming at the mouth, all sexes rape person.
[00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:33.052]  She's a leftist, anti-man dingbat who goes to all the George Soros events and wears the little pink you-know-what hats.
[00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.315]  It's just incredible.
[00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:48.304]  Why get rid of your entire social media history a few weeks after you go to the Democrats and then you guys start cooking up what you're gonna say?
[00:02:48.304 --> 00:02:52.507]  Why'd you go right to the top of the Democratic Party to do all this as a political party operative?
[00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.929]  Wow, you've really turned into a hero.
[00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.971]  And then again, let me explain what's happening.
[00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:01.054]  Here's the giant elephant in the room, or donkey in the room.
[00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:24.280]  I've gone through this, I've experienced it with the New York Times, Washington Post, gets my high school annuals, talks to everybody that knew me in college, calls even second, third, and fourth cousins, and then offers former employees big cash payments to tell their stories, if they've got one.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.082]  And I've experienced unbelievable 100% fraud.
[00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:39.468]  I have experienced people tell lies about me that, on my children, are absolute, complete frauds.
[00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:42.691]  I swear before Jesus Christ Almighty, they're lies.
[00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:44.452]  And by the way, I never do that.
[00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:45.813]  You're not really supposed to do that.
[00:03:45.813 --> 00:03:51.337]  But I'll do it in this extreme situation, even though I'm God-fearing, and it hurt to do that.
[00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:54.139]  Because I told the truth, but I don't want to tempt God.
[00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.142]  But, on my children,
[00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:02.911]  The things that have been put out there about me and the EEOC and all the rest of it are flagrant lies.
[00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:07.515]  I don't wear Nazi tennis shoes.
[00:04:07.515 --> 00:04:13.519]  I didn't sit there and telepathically hit on a male employee.
[00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.222]  I didn't tell a black woman that worked here that I wanted to marry her.
[00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:18.863]  Anything like that!
[00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:22.486]  Anybody that works around here knows that's absolute horse manure.
[00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:23.827]  But these people do it!
[00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:29.488]  They do it, and they think it's funny to lie!
[00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:34.170]  They tell fiction about people trying to destroy their lives, and think it's cute and funny!
[00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.370]  And who did it to me?
[00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.711]  Geragos and Geragos.
[00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:37.771]  Democratic Party.
[00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:39.692]  Worked directly for Hillary.
[00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:42.433]  Cooking up this crap!
[00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.233]  And I know the smell of this!
[00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.114]  You know what?
[00:04:46.114 --> 00:04:49.555]  Smells like a pile of donkey crap!
[00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:52.459]  And that's what it is.
[00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:58.217]  Democratic Party dying trying to stop us taking control of the Supreme Court to save this country.

[00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:12.714]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:18.376]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:40.746]  I have experienced... I, Alex Jones, have experienced the lies that Brett Kavanaugh is now experiencing.
[00:06:40.746 --> 00:06:50.512]  I have seen how the corporate media is nothing but an organized crime syndicate, working with the Democratic Party to assassinate truth and destroy lives.
[00:06:50.512 --> 00:06:58.538]  You've got a woman from 36 years ago as a Democratic Party operative and Democrat, who goes around at George Soros' pussy hat marches,
[00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:02.575]  You've got her students saying she's a vindictive, hateful person.
[00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:07.258]  And you've got her, most importantly, expunging her social media.
[00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:09.299]  Paul Watson has it detailed on InfoWars.com.
[00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:18.085]  But instead of just linking to the Google machine, the Google Archive, we're going to have a whole other article showing what she tried to cover up.
[00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:30.742]  There are 60 plus women that have gone public saying that Brett Kavanaugh treated them with extreme respect and a good person.
[00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:33.003]  Some said he never even saw him drink.
[00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:34.624]  That he was a bookworm egghead.
[00:07:34.624 --> 00:07:41.267]  Yeah, top of his class at every level.
[00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:41.587]  65 women.
[00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:44.028]  But that doesn't matter because let me tell you something.
[00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:46.409]  I know how the Democratic Party operates.
[00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:47.410]  I know how their systems
[00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:53.014]  I know how the dragnets are put out.
[00:07:53.014 --> 00:08:11.082]  And I have experienced massive dragnets against me to contact everyone who ever knew me or halfway knew me to then offer cash payments for them to then make up outrageous fables about me.
[00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:16.424]  Now, this woman has all the telltale signs of doing this for political gain.
[00:08:18.223 --> 00:08:28.552]  And if you know how they operate, they go through Democratic Party databases they've got of super activists, professors, operatives like this lady.
[00:08:28.552 --> 00:08:36.239]  And then they put out feelers to anyone that they can cross-reference that was the same age, lived in the same town as their target.
[00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:49.306]  I've gotten calls from dozens of former high school associates who didn't even really know me, may have talked to me, may have been in class with me, saying, hey, do you remember me?
[00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:50.968]  And I'm like, I barely do.
[00:08:50.968 --> 00:08:56.112]  The New York Times, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed is calling me.
[00:08:56.112 --> 00:09:01.716]  And then when I told them nothing but nice stuff, they called back and said, well, we'll do a big profile on you if you tell us something.
[00:09:01.716 --> 00:09:05.940]  And then closer associates that have actually worked around me, they start threatening them.
[00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.562]  Well, you're going to be in this piece.
[00:09:08.562 --> 00:09:18.650]  It's going to be very damaging to you unless you tell us about how Jones doesn't pay his taxes or pays people under the table.
[00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.132]  And they're like, what are you talking about?
[00:09:22.132 --> 00:09:28.837]  Jones knows he's under amazing scrutiny and pays taxes anyways.
[00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:30.338]  But this is what they do.
[00:09:30.338 --> 00:09:35.082]  And so I'm telling you, like the sun came up this morning.
[00:09:35.082 --> 00:09:36.043]  They have indexed
[00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:59.032]  Every woman in the town he grew up in, everybody he went to high school with, nearby high schools, you name it, and then they run it through a database of people that are in the Democratic Party, and they are getting phone calls one billion percent.
[00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:04.914]  And before she ever gets to testify to Congress, you know that's coming, before they try to push this back to the election,
[00:10:09.153 --> 00:10:10.854]  It all needs to be subpoenaed.
[00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:12.334]  Her email records.
[00:10:12.334 --> 00:10:13.715]  Her phone records.
[00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:18.877]  Because this is, in my view, it's proven that she's a political operative, which she is, and this is being done fraudulently.
[00:10:18.877 --> 00:10:21.178]  That needs to be investigated, if it is.
[00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:24.439]  The sun come up this morning to bear his crap in the woods.
[00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:25.380]  Is water wet?
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.061]  Is mama sweet?
[00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:30.302]  Is milk white?
[00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:34.463]  Do ostriches stick their head in the sand?
[00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:37.805]  Is everything Trump touched turns to solid gold?
[00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:38.405]  The point is,
[00:10:39.892 --> 00:10:52.602]  That just as the sun came up this morning, I figured out, and I know because I've experienced it, we've had insiders at the New York Times and others who were dismayed by it that told us how it's working, what office is doing it.
[00:10:52.602 --> 00:11:00.048]  They have task forces out against Trump, against his family, against Kavanaugh.
[00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:00.889]  We've all been targeted.
[00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:12.574]  And so what they do is they then have law firms and media contact everyone in the database and say, wow, you went to school with Brett Kavanaugh, didn't you?
[00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:15.696]  And they lead them.
[00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:18.277]  Or you went to school with Alex Jones.
[00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.478]  I heard he was a pretty bad guy.
[00:11:21.237 --> 00:11:24.037]  And if they say, oh no, he's a great guy, we'll go, well, thanks a lot.
[00:11:24.037 --> 00:11:25.278]  Click.
[00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:27.118]  Oh, yeah, Brett Kavanaugh, he's terrible.
[00:11:27.118 --> 00:11:27.918]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:28.798]  I went to school with him?
[00:11:28.798 --> 00:11:30.199]  Yeah, you didn't know that?
[00:11:30.199 --> 00:11:37.760]  Yeah, since you're in the school annual, and you were two years younger than him, and... You see how that works?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.380]  See how that works?
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.500]  And then now you're like, yeah, I remember.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.181]  Why, once I was at a party, we were all drunk, and some guys rolled around on a bed with me for five seconds.
[00:11:46.181 --> 00:11:48.062]  I think that was Kavanaugh.
[00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:49.462]  In fact, it was Kavanaugh.
[00:11:49.462 --> 00:11:50.562]  I never told anybody that.
[00:11:53.368 --> 00:12:03.992]  I did tell my counselor in 2012 that a guy groped me when I was 15 in a party, but now she says it felt like he was gonna kill her.
[00:12:03.992 --> 00:12:14.196]  Now it's him for sure, and the fact that they rolled around on a bed for 10 seconds, even if it was him, which it probably isn't, she was gonna die!
[00:12:14.196 --> 00:12:15.076]  You see how this works?
[00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:40.849]  You know the Democrats are calling every woman that grew up in the same town as Kavanaugh, and they're contacting them with databases of anybody that is a Hillary Clinton-loving, man-hating leftist, like this man-hating leftist professor who's expunged her social records, covering all this up.
[00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:47.530]  They sit on it for six weeks until he's days out from confirmation vote next week, and then they drop this.
[00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:54.459]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know they've contacted a whole slew of women.
[00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:56.299]  And I know their pattern.
[00:12:56.299 --> 00:13:03.181]  They're going to release one lady, let her get hit by the barbed wire, let it be criticized, and then boom!
[00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.702]  Release another woman, and then another woman.
[00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:11.744]  And they're all going to be former Democratic Party operatives.
[00:13:11.744 --> 00:13:15.185]  They're all going to be the pussy hat wearers.
[00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:18.826]  They're all going to be the same very cut
[00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:32.462]  And the key to Congress is getting ahead of this and demanding an investigation into who contacted them and swearing them in under oath and demanding discovery.
[00:13:32.462 --> 00:13:36.987]  And they're going to back off real quick as soon as that discovery is demanded.
[00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.212]  The article's on Infowars.com right now.
[00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:43.793]  65 women defend Kavanaugh, said he's a good person amid allegations.
[00:13:43.793 --> 00:13:45.353]  That's getting almost no coverage.
[00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:58.978]  What is, is this one woman who has everything to gain, 36 years later, statute of limitations, long ago gone, they're calling it assault, saying he rolled around in a bed with her.
[00:14:00.247 --> 00:14:01.967]  When they were both drunk.
[00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:03.948]  Who knows if that's even true?
[00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:06.088]  I venture to say it's not true.
[00:14:06.088 --> 00:14:14.990]  And I venture to add, stories on Infowars.com, why did this woman remove?
[00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.111]  Why did she take down her social media?
[00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:21.151]  That is the big question.
[00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:25.172]  That is the point that needs to be pointed out and needs to be hammered.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.201]  Here's the article.
[00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:38.248]  Kavanaugh, accuser, is an anti-Trump leftist who attended Women's March, donated to DNC, attempted to derail nomination, is a blatant political ploy.
[00:14:38.248 --> 00:14:41.150]  And then it goes on.
[00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:47.213]  Ladies and gentlemen, that she has erased her social media presence, but it's too late.
[00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:53.517]  And the Democrats said they would never approve Kavanaugh, no matter what, because it's Donald Trump.
[00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:55.739]  They were always on record
[00:14:57.637 --> 00:15:01.263]  Saying that that was the case.
[00:15:01.263 --> 00:15:09.317]  And now she's smiling like a Cheshire Cat on a Sunday holiday in Alice in Wonderland.
[00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:15.012]  It's all funny, and that's how these operatives win, and it's the tool they use.
[00:15:15.012 --> 00:15:33.864]  That's why Hollywood began eating and selling a few years ago with the Me Too movement, to where if you just even get an allegation of something, you have to step down, you have to go away, so that when they use it finally on Supreme Court nominees, it would be a precedent that you absolutely go straight to prison, no judge, no jury, just social executioner.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:42.947]  I personally have experienced the dirt machine of the corporate media and these law firms, and it's a tactic they use.
[00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:50.854]  And at an intellectual, historical, and gut level, I'm telling you, this is 100% pure horse manure and a fraud.
[00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:52.895]  And Congress should ignore all this.
[00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:53.616]  It's a fraud.
[00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:56.659]  We have laws, statute of limitations, and move forward.
[00:15:56.659 --> 00:15:57.640]  This is made up.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.241]  But more fake women are coming forward.
[00:15:59.241 --> 00:16:03.223]  But most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:08.206]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[00:19:00.502 --> 00:19:01.963]  X2.
[00:19:01.963 --> 00:19:09.809]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:15.914]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[00:19:15.914 --> 00:19:23.360]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I Dream of Jeannie in this.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.180]  It's purple gas.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.523]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:29.685]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[00:19:30.525 --> 00:19:32.907]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[00:19:32.907 --> 00:19:34.047]  Ordered it six months ago.
[00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:35.588]  So I get the price down.
[00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:37.289]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:38.230]  I'm breaking the contract.
[00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.431]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:42.773]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:44.514]  In fact, right now, it is the last run.
[00:19:44.514 --> 00:19:46.495]  We'll search Bible Shield X2.
[00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:47.976]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[00:19:47.976 --> 00:19:49.917]  It'll be gone in a couple months.

[00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:54.400]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.800]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.541]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[00:19:57.541 --> 00:19:58.502]  m4wrestore.com.

[00:20:03.247 --> 00:20:06.351]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:06.351 --> 00:20:07.292]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:20:07.292 --> 00:20:11.838]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.379 --> 00:20:39.341]  Christine Blasey Ford is the first domino to fall.
[00:20:39.341 --> 00:20:46.924]  You heard it here first, there will be more women in the next week and a half that come out ahead of the confirmation vote next week.
[00:20:46.924 --> 00:20:54.106]  And if the Republicans blink and have a bunch of show trial hearings and a bunch of virtues signaling, like
[00:20:56.516 --> 00:21:07.364]  Different White House officials are now saying Kavanaugh will not get confirmed and there will be women coming forward and accusing every nominee that Trump brings forward.
[00:21:07.364 --> 00:21:09.726]  Period.
[00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:11.007]  This is the strategy.
[00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:15.030]  This is how they create the snowball effect.
[00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.892]  The Democrats also come after me and Trump and others.
[00:21:17.892 --> 00:21:18.933]  We've confirmed it.
[00:21:18.933 --> 00:21:19.594]  They've admitted it.
[00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:23.717]  Media Matters a year ago leaked a document where they battle plan it.
[00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:24.737]  George Soros funds it.
[00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:31.055]  They will run a database of everybody you went to college with, high school with, or worked with.
[00:21:31.055 --> 00:21:40.718]  They have databases now, and they have groups that go back at your annuals, get the names, and then run those through if you went to school pre-internet.
[00:21:40.718 --> 00:21:41.798]  I know, it's happened to me.
[00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:45.219]  They then run them through, they then cross-reference that with every
[00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:49.760]  Name that is now a Democrat, particularly an operative.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:22:02.164]  If you're a professor, if you go to Soros rallies, if you donate to Hillary and the DNC, like Christine Ford did, you talk about how much you hate Trump, you get a phone call.
[00:22:02.164 --> 00:22:03.885]  Did Kavanaugh ever hurt you?
[00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:06.966]  Did you know you went to school in the same town?
[00:22:06.966 --> 00:22:12.788]  And then, my gosh, those forgotten memories, those hidden memories of the UFO.
[00:22:14.304 --> 00:22:16.106]  Actually beaming her up.
[00:22:16.106 --> 00:22:24.233]  There was Kavanaugh, with a little gray alien suit on, and he threw her on the bed and grubbed her.
[00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:27.475]  I mean, I can say that Kavanaugh raped me.
[00:22:27.475 --> 00:22:28.516]  This is 36 years later.
[00:22:28.516 --> 00:22:30.438]  It's why we have a statute of limitations.
[00:22:30.438 --> 00:22:33.941]  If we had a history of this, or a background of it, like he was Bill Clinton or something,
[00:22:35.011 --> 00:22:43.515]  Then you could say, okay, maybe this is an issue, but no, this is 36 years ago when they're in high school, supposedly, at a party, illegally drinking, under the age.
[00:22:43.515 --> 00:22:46.416]  Why, under the age of 18, do they expunge your record?
[00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:48.317]  Because a lot of us do stupid things.
[00:22:48.317 --> 00:22:54.359]  But Kavanaugh's friends and others and people that knew him, 65 women have gone public, they said no.
[00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:57.220]  Most of them said we never even saw him drink or go to parties.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.921]  And that's what Bill Maher said last week.
[00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:01.462]  He said, this guy doesn't look like he goes to parties.
[00:23:01.462 --> 00:23:02.943]  This makes us, the Democrats, look bad.
[00:23:04.517 --> 00:23:11.043]  Because this is the first woman that they contacted that had the memories.
[00:23:11.043 --> 00:23:15.927]  And so now she gets to be the big star and help bring down Kavanaugh and save America!
[00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:22.132]  They even had New York Times op-eds last year saying, it's time to lie to stop Trump.
[00:23:22.132 --> 00:23:27.077]  We need to throw all morals to the wayside.
[00:23:27.077 --> 00:23:28.018]  And so mark my words.
[00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:43.362]  There are more women who are either going to see this in the news and figure out that they went to the same town and the same school, the same area as Kavanaugh, that are going to have the memories, the snowball, the mockingbird effect.
[00:23:43.362 --> 00:23:55.964]  But they're not going to need to do that because they're getting contacted just like the Sun came up this morning by the Washington Post, the New York Times, BuzzFeed, ThinkProgress, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL, Media Matters.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:05.009]  All of them are using data mining and are hounding and calling every woman in that town where Kavanaugh grew up.
[00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:06.611]  We'll be going over that here today.
[00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.833]  So how do you respond to that?
[00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:10.055]  You have to data mine.
[00:24:10.055 --> 00:24:11.236]  The Republicans have to.
[00:24:12.267 --> 00:24:17.249]  Legally and lawfully, and they have to contact, because a bunch of the women are going to go, yeah!
[00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:21.271]  I got called six weeks ago within days of him being the nominee.
[00:24:21.271 --> 00:24:24.392]  They were really, really pushy, but I remember Brett being a great guy.
[00:24:24.392 --> 00:24:25.852]  They've obviously already contacted him.
[00:24:25.852 --> 00:24:29.174]  They got 65 women saying he's a real sport.
[00:24:29.174 --> 00:24:34.636]  But I guarantee you they've been contacted by the Democrats.
[00:24:34.636 --> 00:24:37.277]  You roll them out, it's game over.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.421]  Why do you think they want me off air?
[00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:48.743]  Nine times out of ten it is my strategies that end up defeating these people.
[00:24:48.743 --> 00:24:53.345]  You think it's fun to have the strategies to beat them?
[00:24:53.345 --> 00:24:59.288]  So here's your headline from this live broadcast last three segments.
[00:24:59.288 --> 00:25:03.890]  They're going to roll more women out to bring down Kavanaugh.
[00:25:06.087 --> 00:25:09.448]  This is an organized Democratic Party operation.
[00:25:09.448 --> 00:25:13.690]  And this is how you stop it.
[00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.051]  But again, we're social creatures.
[00:25:16.051 --> 00:25:31.318]  So the Democrats throw a bunch of their people, hundreds of them overboard, sometimes for cause, sometimes for not, overboard, until the mere allegation, he'd be 36 years old with no proof, no witnesses.
[00:25:31.318 --> 00:25:35.200]  The people that she cites as witnesses that were there said no such thing ever happened.
[00:25:36.954 --> 00:25:43.137]  They're flabbergasted, but it doesn't matter, because it's causing the snowball, and it's the first domino.
[00:25:43.137 --> 00:25:45.098]  People aren't going to buy this one.
[00:25:45.098 --> 00:25:52.001]  But then, within days, other women are going to come forward.
[00:25:54.209 --> 00:25:59.955]  And the Republicans will sputter and falter, and, OK, Kavanaugh's withdrawn, even though it's not true.
[00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:12.468]  And then the next nominee, and the next, and the next, and the next, until it'll have to be a bubble boy, raised in a bubble, in his own little bubble house for his whole life learning law.
[00:26:12.468 --> 00:26:15.852]  And when he's 55, 60 years old, and he's been in a bubble,
[00:26:17.895 --> 00:26:20.877]  Telephonically coming in, you know, to courtrooms.
[00:26:20.877 --> 00:26:23.318]  He'll work in courtrooms as a lawyer and then a judge.
[00:26:23.318 --> 00:26:27.501]  He'll go to Harvard, but via, from his bubble, via the internet.
[00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:33.685]  And then one day, he will leave the bubble by helicopter and will be flown.
[00:26:33.685 --> 00:26:35.466]  No, the bubble will be flown to the Senate.
[00:26:35.466 --> 00:26:38.748]  And they'll have confirmation hearings, but him in the bubble.
[00:26:38.748 --> 00:26:40.829]  He'll have a bubble suit.
[00:26:40.829 --> 00:26:45.852]  And then, within the bubble suit, he will then be confirmed.
[00:26:45.852 --> 00:26:46.973]  But by then, the country will be gone.
[00:26:48.459 --> 00:27:03.754]  Because they can always, with databases now, they'll find a deranged, Trump derangement syndrome, hateful person who will then make up whatever they need to.
[00:27:03.754 --> 00:27:12.183]  And of course now her own students coming up next segment are going public saying that she is a horribly vindictive, mean person.
[00:27:13.226 --> 00:27:16.767]  That report is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:25.149]  And that she tells the students that she'll do basically whatever it takes.
[00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:26.009]  So there you go.
[00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:29.390]  That's what this is.
[00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.091]  That's how these folks are operating.
[00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:33.031]  And that's where this is going.
[00:27:33.031 --> 00:27:39.652]  So you gotta ask yourself, what are you gonna do about it to stop it?
[00:27:39.652 --> 00:27:41.753]  Now, we're going to break.
[00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:50.692]  But first, we're running out of Survival Shield X2, the purest iodine deep-earth crystal source that anybody's been able to find.
[00:27:50.692 --> 00:27:55.494]  It's very hard to source it, and I would put over a barrel for the cost of it, so it's been discontinued.
[00:27:55.494 --> 00:27:57.214]  We're working on some more suppliers.
[00:27:57.214 --> 00:27:59.155]  We hope we get some soon.
[00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:03.636]  But this is the last run of Survival Shield X2 in this formulation.
[00:28:03.636 --> 00:28:04.977]  It is amazing.
[00:28:04.977 --> 00:28:05.697]  It is incredible.
[00:28:06.522 --> 00:28:09.705]  It is dark amber in its form.
[00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:14.691]  Then you put it on paper, it turns purple-blue because it oxidizes and is the pure deep-earth crystal source.
[00:28:16.158 --> 00:28:17.759]  It is the good halogen.
[00:28:17.759 --> 00:28:18.520]  It is amazing.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.821]  The bad halogens, the fluoride, the bromine.
[00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:24.043]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy for yourself.

[00:28:59.554 --> 00:29:01.736]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:02.516]  Not true.
[00:29:02.516 --> 00:29:04.377]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[00:29:04.377 --> 00:29:08.360]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[00:32:00.063 --> 00:32:01.404]  We knew it was coming.
[00:32:01.404 --> 00:32:02.845]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:32:02.845 --> 00:32:15.715]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:32:16.115 --> 00:32:27.165]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:32:27.165 --> 00:32:36.053]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[00:32:36.713 --> 00:32:46.158]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[00:32:46.158 --> 00:32:58.284]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show, how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:32:58.284 --> 00:33:03.246]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[00:33:03.246 --> 00:33:05.868]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.255 --> 00:33:24.862]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[00:33:24.862 --> 00:33:26.545]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:44.716 --> 00:33:53.234]  Well, I thought I'd get a lot of the top lawyers that I really respect on the broadcast today to respond to this whole Kavanaugh fiasco.
[00:33:53.234 --> 00:33:55.959]  So we've got Mark Rondazza, who's the First Amendment.
[00:33:56.883 --> 00:34:01.645]  Lawyer and also deals with a lot of these big sexual harassment cases.
[00:34:01.645 --> 00:34:09.408]  In fact, he's on the side of prominent women in some of these, including in the Las Vegas Wynn case that's going on right now.
[00:34:09.408 --> 00:34:11.708]  So he's very prominent in that.
[00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:13.149]  So he thinks you've done something wrong to women.
[00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:15.090]  He'll actually come after you.
[00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:20.412]  And then we've got Tyler Nixon joining us as well.
[00:34:20.412 --> 00:34:23.213]  And he he is a constitutional lawyer.
[00:34:24.574 --> 00:34:27.837]  And obviously related to Richard Nixon and good friends with Roger Stone.
[00:34:27.837 --> 00:34:33.042]  But the reason he's coming on is to chime in on this, but also he grew up with the Bidens.
[00:34:33.042 --> 00:34:35.805]  He lived next door to the Bidens.
[00:34:35.805 --> 00:34:38.408]  He bought the property of the Bidens.
[00:34:38.408 --> 00:34:40.710]  He has done everything with the Bidens.
[00:34:41.707 --> 00:34:46.290]  And I mean everything that he would do with people he grew up next door to.
[00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:52.313]  So wait till you hear about this, since Biden says that we're all these horrible scallywags.
[00:34:52.313 --> 00:34:56.296]  The word he used was the dregs of society, Trump supporters.
[00:34:56.296 --> 00:35:01.379]  And then Larry Klayman, constitutional lawyer, will also be joining us.
[00:35:01.379 --> 00:35:04.281]  And then Gavin McGinnis will host the fourth hour.
[00:35:05.845 --> 00:35:09.647]  From the great folks over at CRTV.
[00:35:09.647 --> 00:35:13.969]  People ask, man, you have a lot of CRTV folks on.
[00:35:13.969 --> 00:35:16.610]  And, you know, they have me on some of their shows.
[00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:20.292]  I'm glad CRTV's out there.
[00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:22.393]  I'm really glad Drudge Report's out there.
[00:35:22.393 --> 00:35:25.615]  I'm really glad that Tucker Carlson's out there.
[00:35:25.615 --> 00:35:29.637]  I'm really, really, really glad that Matt Drudge is out there, because I would already be gone.
[00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:38.815]  Don't want to give him that much credit because they'll come after him, but they already know he's got the second biggest website in the world.
[00:35:38.815 --> 00:35:42.418]  Second biggest website, not news site.
[00:35:42.418 --> 00:35:44.359]  It's the biggest news site in the world.
[00:35:44.359 --> 00:35:47.061]  They already know, without drudge, Trump wouldn't have gotten elected.
[00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:54.947]  They already know he is invaluably, incalculably important.
[00:35:54.947 --> 00:35:58.670]  And all of you are together as well, and I've been critical.
[00:35:59.212 --> 00:35:59.872]  You know, in the fight.
[00:35:59.872 --> 00:36:01.153]  All of us together!
[00:36:01.153 --> 00:36:06.797]  But Drudge is second only to Trump.
[00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:11.640]  And I feel good when he's there.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.263]  When I sit there and, oh, Drudge reports 100 times bigger than Infowars.
[00:36:15.263 --> 00:36:18.645]  Thank God!
[00:36:18.645 --> 00:36:20.166]  Thank God!
[00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:23.889]  I mean, I hope CRTV takes over the planet.
[00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:28.132]  They're pro-Second Amendment, pro-sovereignty, anti-globalist.
[00:36:28.132 --> 00:36:28.392]  I just...
[00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:32.632]  World Net Daily, Daily Caller, all of it.
[00:36:32.632 --> 00:36:34.414]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:36:34.414 --> 00:36:36.836]  Other talk show host.
[00:36:36.836 --> 00:36:40.118]  And you know, so many so-called conservatives try to get brownie points.
[00:36:40.118 --> 00:36:43.661]  Like when I had Eric Bollinger, very charming guy in person.
[00:36:43.661 --> 00:36:46.983]  Always liked him on Fox, except when he lied about me.
[00:36:46.983 --> 00:36:51.026]  And he's like, you know, Alex, you're part of that alt-right, the white supremacist.
[00:36:51.026 --> 00:36:54.649]  And I'm like, dude, you're putting out Hillary talking points.
[00:36:54.649 --> 00:36:57.311]  Of course, he knew full well he was doing it to protect himself.
[00:36:58.592 --> 00:37:04.396]  We need to stop acting like Trumps.
[00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:06.698]  There's no half measures here.
[00:37:06.698 --> 00:37:10.181]  You don't need to come on my show and then get afraid you're going to get attacked for it.
[00:37:10.181 --> 00:37:14.004]  So you got to add all these provisos and put out Democratic Party talking points.
[00:37:14.004 --> 00:37:15.385]  Matt Drudge didn't do that when he came here.
[00:37:15.385 --> 00:37:18.307]  Because Matt Drudge is a real man.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.261]  And when I say that, I mean that.
[00:37:24.261 --> 00:37:33.609]  That's what a man does, is they say what they think, and they don't sit there and improvise those to try to fit in with everybody else and make sure you don't get attacked.
[00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:38.793]  A leader does what's right, regardless of the cost, for the greater good.
[00:37:38.793 --> 00:37:41.635]  Because it's instinctive, and it's what they do.
[00:37:41.635 --> 00:37:44.478]  You know, people ask me what Trump says when he's called me.
[00:37:45.885 --> 00:37:47.166]  And it's what Trump told my wife.
[00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:49.387]  And it's not about bragging about Alex Jones.
[00:37:49.387 --> 00:38:05.458]  But it's about understanding why I tick, and how I operate, and what I'm trying to do, so that when you see me being demonized, and lied about, and cut to pieces sometimes, you don't get demoralized thinking, man, we love Alex and he's really getting hurt.
[00:38:05.458 --> 00:38:06.959]  I knew where this was going.
[00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:10.102]  I knew that if I was successful, they'd try to destroy me.
[00:38:10.102 --> 00:38:10.602]  It's worth it.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.441]  You know what Trump told my wife when he called her one time, one of the times?
[00:38:17.441 --> 00:38:26.244]  He said, let me tell you something, and I usually only say this to people that have won major medals and stuff, and people tougher than me.
[00:38:26.244 --> 00:38:30.685]  He goes, your husband's a real man.
[00:38:30.685 --> 00:38:34.186]  You know what he goes through to make this country great again and to bring people together?
[00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:35.146]  You know how he gets attacked?
[00:38:36.172 --> 00:38:37.232]  Believe me, I've experienced it.
[00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:38.592]  He's a real man.
[00:38:38.592 --> 00:38:44.894]  So when he's stressed out, or he needs your support, hold on to him, love him, and understand that he's not like these other cowards.
[00:38:44.894 --> 00:38:46.514]  He's not built like other people.
[00:38:46.514 --> 00:38:47.594]  He's a bulldog.
[00:38:47.594 --> 00:38:48.515]  He's a real man.
[00:38:48.515 --> 00:38:52.975]  I had like a 10-minute conversation with him telling her how I'm a real man.
[00:38:52.975 --> 00:38:55.676]  And again, because he's a real man!
[00:38:55.676 --> 00:38:57.656]  Matt Drudge is a real man!
[00:38:57.656 --> 00:39:02.897]  I want to be a real man!
[00:39:02.897 --> 00:39:04.958]  When I go to somebody else's show, even if I disagree with them,
[00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:08.340]  I don't sit there and go, well I disagree with you on this and that.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.641]  I just talk about what I believe in.
[00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:11.762]  And if they want to debate me, then I debate it.
[00:39:11.762 --> 00:39:14.603]  I didn't get Eric Boulding on, who I like, who I talked to on the phone now.
[00:39:14.603 --> 00:39:16.744]  He's a smart guy, very talented.
[00:39:16.744 --> 00:39:21.165]  I don't go, hey Eric, let's talk about that sexual harassment, which is a bunch of crap.
[00:39:21.165 --> 00:39:24.687]  To get little, oh you're attacking me, let me get some points back on you.
[00:39:24.687 --> 00:39:29.669]  And I'm not taking Eric to the woodshed to be mean to him.
[00:39:29.669 --> 00:39:34.151]  I'm taking Eric to the woodshed because I'm going to play a key clip of him with the added documentation next segment.
[00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.271]  I want him to understand the real paradigm of leadership.
[00:39:38.271 --> 00:39:46.594]  Because he's a tough guy, former professional baseball player, you know, very successful economist, very successful oil and gas future trader.
[00:39:46.594 --> 00:39:48.675]  He's a tough guy.
[00:39:48.675 --> 00:39:53.036]  The point is, is he needs to get mentally tough.
[00:39:53.036 --> 00:40:02.660]  The video that we're about to air here, just posted to InfoWards.com last night, is titled, Watch CRTV's Eric Bolling get blown away by Trump's 9-11 comments.
[00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.071]  This is important because it's the truth.
[00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.633]  You need to see it.
[00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:13.735]  He kept saying, oh yeah, you don't have a clip of this, you don't have a clip of that.
[00:40:13.735 --> 00:40:17.318]  I said, well you know what, I'm gonna take what you say here and I'm gonna put it out.
[00:40:17.318 --> 00:40:19.579]  And again, I like Eric.
[00:40:19.579 --> 00:40:21.741]  I'm not putting Eric down.
[00:40:21.741 --> 00:40:23.442]  For who he is in general.
[00:40:23.442 --> 00:40:23.782]  It's that...
[00:40:25.947 --> 00:40:28.208]  Behind the scenes, he knows a lot more than he's letting on to.
[00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:33.791]  And I'm just saying, hey man, you want to really be successful, go all the way.
[00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:35.812]  Stop caring what people think.
[00:40:35.812 --> 00:40:38.154]  Tell them what you really think.
[00:40:38.154 --> 00:40:41.395]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:40:41.395 --> 00:40:44.057]  He was teasing me about Vegas, being an inside job and stuff, and I said, dude,
[00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:54.317]  Multiple witnesses, multiple shooters, hundreds of witnesses, stand down orders, Islamist terrorist in the area, on and on and on, it's unsolved.
[00:40:54.317 --> 00:41:00.541]  The guy was going to the Middle East, we first broke down, he goes, yeah, I already know all that, I've been researching, I'm going to Vegas to do a big investigation.
[00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.382]  And he started saying more stuff than I knew.
[00:41:02.382 --> 00:41:04.284]  I'm like, well, there you go.
[00:41:04.284 --> 00:41:09.588]  He's teasing me about it being an inside job, and then, boom, lays out he knows everything.
[00:41:09.588 --> 00:41:10.668]  And that's what I'm telling you.
[00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:12.670]  We just can't sit on this stuff anymore.
[00:41:15.034 --> 00:41:17.155]  It's got to come out.
[00:41:17.155 --> 00:41:28.122]  The Democrats, the globalists, the stuff Biden's been saying about the president, what he's been saying about you being a dreg of society, Obama, the stuttering, bumbling mess.
[00:41:28.122 --> 00:41:32.284]  I saw the boil down, like a three minute clip that I don't want to subject you to, but it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:32.284 --> 00:41:38.208]  If you want to see him just stuttering and fumbling and I, I, I, I, I, I, I stuttering 10 times worse than I do.
[00:41:38.208 --> 00:41:43.111]  Because the teleprompter hasn't loaded yet.
[00:41:46.429 --> 00:41:51.914]  79 times, talks about himself, stutters continually.
[00:41:51.914 --> 00:41:53.655]  The guy is a joke.
[00:41:53.655 --> 00:41:55.616]  And these people want to dominate us.
[00:41:55.616 --> 00:42:10.768]  So we need to wake up and come together and not listen to the Democratic Party's talking points about me, or about Trump, or about Tucker Carlson now, Brian Stelter, and Oliver Darcy, who are the anointed ones with no viewers or listeners.
[00:42:10.768 --> 00:42:12.429]  Their retweets are like 100 retweets.
[00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:14.111]  Literally high school students have more retweets.
[00:42:15.322 --> 00:42:17.364]  They've now decided their new target is Tucker Carlson.
[00:42:17.364 --> 00:42:19.105]  The headline was, what happened to him?
[00:42:19.105 --> 00:42:20.586]  And they go, actually nothing.
[00:42:20.586 --> 00:42:23.128]  He was always a deep racist.
[00:42:23.128 --> 00:42:25.029]  What?
[00:42:25.029 --> 00:42:26.070]  That's all you've got?
[00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:34.897]  Well, yeah, the new talking point from the Democratic Party, from Biden, from MSNBC, and everything else is, Trump is a Holocaust denier.
[00:42:34.897 --> 00:42:37.058]  Yes, yes, he's a Nazi.
[00:42:38.672 --> 00:42:46.455]  There was Biden in the speech talking about, there was the Klan with the burning torches of the night, and they're coming to get you, unless you vote Democrat.
[00:42:46.455 --> 00:42:48.596]  And the crowd's laughing, he says, shut up, shut up!
[00:42:48.596 --> 00:42:49.396]  It's real!
[00:42:49.396 --> 00:42:50.777]  It's scary!
[00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:54.518]  What is scary is that you passed the laws to put more blacks in prison.
[00:42:54.518 --> 00:42:57.640]  You're a racist, and you, the word is, are in the KKK!
[00:42:59.531 --> 00:43:01.852]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:44:06.807 --> 00:44:10.590]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:19.296]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:44:19.296 --> 00:44:23.879]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:44:23.879 --> 00:44:25.340]  You are the info war.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.863]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:44:29.543 --> 00:44:40.929]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:48.894]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:55.957]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:44:55.957 --> 00:44:58.699]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:09.467]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:15.491]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[00:45:15.491 --> 00:45:23.857]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I Dream of Jeannie, and there's this purple gas.
[00:45:23.857 --> 00:45:27.179]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[00:45:27.179 --> 00:45:29.161]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:35.244]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[00:45:35.244 --> 00:45:36.945]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:37.886]  I'm breaking the contract.
[00:45:37.886 --> 00:45:40.087]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[00:45:40.087 --> 00:45:42.428]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[00:45:42.428 --> 00:45:43.909]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:47.631]  It's viable shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[00:45:47.631 --> 00:45:49.572]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[00:45:49.572 --> 00:45:52.234]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.

[00:47:03.297 --> 00:47:05.939]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:26.022]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:47:26.022 --> 00:47:29.223]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.223 --> 00:47:31.363]  Christine Blasey Ford!
[00:47:31.363 --> 00:47:41.285]  I'm going to have three lawyers, three constitutional lawyers on to look at this coming up in the next hour and a half.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:44.846]  We got big news on the Infowars Army Front.
[00:47:44.846 --> 00:47:49.287]  The You Taking Action, the Information War out there, listeners, with Owen Schroer and Gavin McGinnis.
[00:47:50.754 --> 00:48:06.368]  We're going to get to this key piece of video that's also up on Infowars.com that's critical to send everybody you know, because if you don't share the articles and the videos, they win banning us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, everywhere else.
[00:48:06.368 --> 00:48:11.233]  They put a hoax out there that if you share my videos or post them, you'll be banned.
[00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:15.297]  And they tried that with a few people and had to back off because Congress is starting hearings.
[00:48:15.297 --> 00:48:16.438]  Tucker Carlson covered it.
[00:48:18.055 --> 00:48:28.325]  If they ban anybody, especially anybody prominent, sharing our info or having us on, believe me, the Judiciary Committee and others are just waiting like a crocodile with its mouth open.
[00:48:28.325 --> 00:48:36.393]  Okay, that's why when they banned the walk-away Brandon Strzok guy for a few days on Facebook, they then reinstated it very quickly because
[00:48:39.386 --> 00:48:43.431]  We are so close, 50 days out, to Trump with executive orders, you name it.
[00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:49.019]  And you see the drip, drip, drip of insider stuff coming out about Google being political, lying, suppressing people.
[00:48:49.019 --> 00:48:52.183]  We're just softening them up and getting them ready before we take action.
[00:48:53.612 --> 00:49:00.942]  And these little arrogant SOBs and big tech moving to China, not working with the Pentagon but working with the Chinese military, they have really gone too far.
[00:49:00.942 --> 00:49:01.562]  They are crazy.
[00:49:01.562 --> 00:49:11.375]  Because they're allied with the Democrats, and Mueller and Phil Mudd and all these guys, and they really think they're going to defeat America and get rid of me and get rid of Trump, and it's not going to happen.
[00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:15.251]  See, they think thinking, this is very key what I'm about to say.
[00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:20.412]  The globalists think thinking multi-dimensional is multi-pronged attacks.
[00:49:20.412 --> 00:49:26.573]  They think an attack that hits on a bunch of fronts and helps them in a bunch of ways is a good attack.
[00:49:26.573 --> 00:49:37.295]  So they'll get mainstream media and big corporations and the elements of the CIA and universities to all come in and attack free speech and bully conservatives.
[00:49:37.295 --> 00:49:38.836]  That's not multi-dimensional.
[00:49:38.836 --> 00:49:40.676]  That's multi-faceted, multi-pronged.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:45.222]  A multi-dimensional thinker would think next dimension.
[00:49:45.222 --> 00:49:52.825]  That's going to anger people and make them mad and only make the strongest continue fighting who will make the leadership actually more resistant.
[00:49:52.825 --> 00:50:00.889]  Not what you want is people to become reflexive in giving into it instead of reflexive in resisting.
[00:50:00.889 --> 00:50:03.170]  So then they start a true resistance paradigm.
[00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:04.671]  Then you go out a few more moves.
[00:50:08.195 --> 00:50:12.578]  Not too good for me and my body, but good for my children and their children.
[00:50:12.578 --> 00:50:16.881]  So my spirit says, attack!
[00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:21.425]  I mean, I'm talking, I'm moving 20, 30, 50 moves ahead, and you guys just can't do it.
[00:50:21.425 --> 00:50:24.307]  You can't stare into the ether and do that.
[00:50:24.307 --> 00:50:26.448]  You're not in the Trump dimension, you're not in the Jones dimension.
[00:50:29.335 --> 00:50:32.218]  The reason they're censoring us is they fear you.
[00:50:32.218 --> 00:50:37.803]  And so here's a little promo piece cut a month ago, back when our app was number one on Apple, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:50:37.803 --> 00:50:39.685]  They then banned it.
[00:50:39.685 --> 00:50:42.308]  But it's still on Android, InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:50:42.308 --> 00:50:46.352]  Even if they ban it, you'll still have it, which makes the value of the app incredible.
[00:50:46.352 --> 00:50:52.457]  So you'll be ambassadors from InfoWars with this piece of banned technology from the Information Wars of 2018.
[00:50:52.457 --> 00:50:53.719]  So here's that little promo piece.
[00:50:58.914 --> 00:51:04.407]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer and TV.
[00:51:04.407 --> 00:51:06.491]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:17.813]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts, like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:17.813 --> 00:51:24.554]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[00:51:24.554 --> 00:51:29.776]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[00:51:29.776 --> 00:51:31.136]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:51:31.136 --> 00:51:31.957]  Download the app.
[00:51:31.957 --> 00:51:33.577]  That's so fast, InfoWars.
[00:51:33.577 --> 00:51:35.618]  Apple banned your app.
[00:51:35.618 --> 00:51:36.998]  Oh, it's Tim Cote.
[00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:42.563]  I hate free speech too!
[00:51:42.563 --> 00:51:44.825]  We hate free speech!
[00:51:44.825 --> 00:51:46.146]  We hate free speech!
[00:52:07.709 --> 00:52:11.992]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory that some crazy person made up.
[00:52:11.992 --> 00:52:14.654]  I said I do not agree with you that the U.S.
[00:52:14.654 --> 00:52:19.697]  government, someone inside the government, had knowledge of the terror attack prior to the attack.
[00:52:19.697 --> 00:52:20.317]  Oh really?
[00:52:20.317 --> 00:52:29.203]  All over Twitter yesterday, mainline leftist sites celebrated, said America deserved it, reality winner, had a top-secret security clearance, was helping ISIS.
[00:52:29.203 --> 00:52:32.445]  There are some, the average professor at UT down the street,
[00:52:32.905 --> 00:52:35.246]  He loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[00:52:35.246 --> 00:52:40.187]  There were elements in our government allied with radical Islam that helped them carry out the attack!
[00:52:40.187 --> 00:52:45.628]  You can argue whether or not America deserved it or not, I don't think.
[00:52:45.628 --> 00:52:47.288]  I don't think America deserved it!
[00:52:47.288 --> 00:52:49.589]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it!
[00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:57.951]  Your theory, Alex, your theory was not only did America not deserve it, but the United States government knew about the attack prior to the attack and decided to stand down.
[00:52:57.951 --> 00:52:58.771]  A very different theory.
[00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:00.551]  I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[00:53:00.551 --> 00:53:02.332]  It's not that I'm running away from it.
[00:53:02.332 --> 00:53:04.193]  It's that the media misrepresents what I say about it.
[00:53:04.193 --> 00:53:08.874]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam is one of the number one threats on the planet, probably number one.
[00:53:08.874 --> 00:53:15.056]  I know that there are criminals in our government, like Brennan, who reportedly converted to Wahhabism.
[00:53:15.056 --> 00:53:19.777]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring to overthrow our allies in Egypt, you name it.
[00:53:19.777 --> 00:53:22.678]  And I think that elements let this happen, like PNAC.
[00:53:23.338 --> 00:53:24.859]  I don't blame our military!
[00:53:45.666 --> 00:53:46.566]  Oh, you hate our military?
[00:53:46.566 --> 00:53:47.287]  No, I love our military.
[00:53:47.287 --> 00:53:55.730]  The Bin Laden family was whisked out of the United States by President Bush himself right after the 9-11 attack and they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:56.251]  That's right.
[00:53:56.251 --> 00:54:07.355]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:07.355 --> 00:54:10.757]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance with the left
[00:54:11.557 --> 00:54:14.781]  And there are people in the government working to protect Islam.
[00:54:14.781 --> 00:54:16.963]  They got this imam that's connected to dozens of bombings.
[00:54:16.963 --> 00:54:21.649]  After six months, he's being released from British prison next week.
[00:54:21.649 --> 00:54:24.372]  You said some things that I agree with.
[00:54:24.372 --> 00:54:28.717]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United States, our freedom, maybe even the globe.
[00:54:28.717 --> 00:54:29.838]  I'll agree with that.
[00:54:29.838 --> 00:54:30.819]  Maybe the left's bigger though.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:40.765]  Well, I think the one on the left is a different type of threat and it's a longer-term threat where, you know, radical Islam could, you know, kill a lot of people real fast.
[00:54:40.765 --> 00:54:44.447]  And the left, it's going to take a while for them to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:47.328]  But I think we can deal with a straight-on attack like radical Islam.
[00:54:47.328 --> 00:54:48.469]  It's the left creeping around.
[00:54:48.469 --> 00:54:49.769]  I don't like them either.
[00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:50.770]  I'm on board with that.
[00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:55.252]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying Building 7 has already fallen.
[00:54:55.252 --> 00:54:56.633]  Have you seen that video?
[00:54:56.633 --> 00:54:57.073]  No.
[00:54:57.073 --> 00:54:58.314]  And it's right behind her.
[00:54:59.119 --> 00:54:59.579]  I can't hear her.
[00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:01.381]  Do you want me to play it for you?
[00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.023]  Well, I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[00:55:04.023 --> 00:55:11.288]  And by the way, you know, Alex, anyone could throw a video of the picture behind it as a news person.
[00:55:11.288 --> 00:55:13.290]  Well, she's saying Building 7 has fallen.
[00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.891]  They put the story out beforehand.
[00:55:14.891 --> 00:55:18.274]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[00:55:18.274 --> 00:55:23.177]  You might have heard a few moments ago I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[00:55:23.177 --> 00:55:24.098]  And indeed it has.
[00:55:24.098 --> 00:55:27.801]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:30.163]  Well, only really what you already know.
[00:55:30.163 --> 00:55:31.925]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[00:55:31.925 --> 00:55:41.314]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7, in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:44.337]  It was almost as if it were a planned enclosure.
[00:55:44.337 --> 00:55:46.159]  It just pancaked.
[00:55:46.159 --> 00:55:48.662]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision enclosure.
[00:55:53.078 --> 00:56:01.919]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:56:07.333 --> 00:56:17.923]  Donald Trump is on the line, and we know him as the man behind lots of real estate in Manhattan, and of course, Donald, I understand you were actually a witness to what happened this morning.
[00:56:17.923 --> 00:56:24.109]  Well, I have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center, and I saw this huge explosion.
[00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:27.712]  I was with a group of people, and I really couldn't even believe it.
[00:56:28.496 --> 00:56:33.001]  And even, I think, worse than that, for years I've looked right directly at the building.
[00:56:33.001 --> 00:56:37.405]  I'd see the Empire State Building in the foreground and the World Trade Center in the background.
[00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.222]  And now I'm looking at absolutely nothing.
[00:56:40.222 --> 00:56:40.762]  It's just gone.
[00:56:40.762 --> 00:56:44.123]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[00:56:44.123 --> 00:56:46.144]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[00:56:46.144 --> 00:56:49.186]  Now the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[00:56:49.186 --> 00:56:52.187]  This was an unbelievably powerful building.
[00:56:52.187 --> 00:56:56.068]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[00:56:56.068 --> 00:57:02.571]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[00:57:02.571 --> 00:57:04.492]  So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[00:57:04.492 --> 00:57:07.593]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams,
[00:57:08.163 --> 00:57:13.126]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it, because there was a hole in the steel.
[00:57:13.126 --> 00:57:17.269]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[00:57:17.269 --> 00:57:20.912]  I think you, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow.
[00:57:20.912 --> 00:57:23.013]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[00:57:23.013 --> 00:57:31.719]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through the steel?
[00:57:31.719 --> 00:57:37.823]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine
[00:57:38.363 --> 00:57:40.444]  Anything being able to go through that wall.
[00:57:40.444 --> 00:57:43.686]  Most buildings are built with the steelers on the inside around the elevators.
[00:57:43.686 --> 00:57:46.167]  We'll be back with the full reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:59:57.743 --> 01:00:01.766]  You gave me fire!

[01:00:08.512 --> 01:00:13.215]  I'm every person you need to be!
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.481]  Okay, thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:20.481 --> 01:00:24.181]  We're into the second hour, broadcasting world-wide.
[01:00:24.181 --> 01:00:27.842]  First Amendment constitutional lawyer Mark Rondazza joins us.
[01:00:27.842 --> 01:00:30.483]  He's also one of my great lawyers.
[01:00:30.483 --> 01:00:36.104]  And Larry Klayman is popping in, constitutional lawyer, one of the few lawyers, the only lawyer to beat the NSA in court.
[01:00:36.104 --> 01:00:38.045]  We're batting down the hatches here.
[01:00:38.045 --> 01:00:39.085]  Almost having three o'clock here.
[01:00:39.685 --> 01:00:55.632]  And then we've got Tyler Nixon, constitutional lawyer, and somebody that actually grew up with Biden's kids, lived next door to him, to get into Biden's statements about how we're the dregs of society, we support Trump, and just some of the mafia tactics they engage in up there in the northeastern corner of the U.S.
[01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:06.937]  And then we also are going to be having, of course, Gavin McGinnis of CRTV joining us, Owen Schroyer, and a lot more.
[01:01:06.937 --> 01:01:08.018]  We're going to break in a few minutes.
[01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:11.540]  Some stages don't carry this first five, and I like to do it, but some do want to carry it.
[01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:19.127]  I didn't call you like CNN would do, who you also report for, do some work for, and say, what's your view before I got you on?
[01:01:19.127 --> 01:01:25.972]  I respect you, you're a smart guy, and I know a lot of times you say this, me too, but it can be a fraud, but you also sometimes are on the other side of it.
[01:01:25.972 --> 01:01:40.684]  So I wanted to get your take on Christine Blassie Ford, this admitted Democratic Party minion and operative, who is now, in my view, crawled out from under a rock, you know, with this info, right was yours, his name.
[01:01:41.687 --> 01:01:44.149]  They sit on it for six weeks.
[01:01:44.149 --> 01:01:46.630]  Turns out she expunged all of her social media.
[01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:54.975]  I think that's very suspicious, but when we talked during the break, your view is, hey, that'll be on the Supreme Court, you know, why not hear from her?
[01:01:54.975 --> 01:01:56.096]  That's how I look at it.
[01:01:56.096 --> 01:02:04.361]  I mean, I had a different view when this was an anonymous note that nobody was coming forward and putting their name to.
[01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:07.863]  But now that she's put her name to it, she said she's willing to testify.
[01:02:09.191 --> 01:02:12.636]  I don't see any harm in at least hearing from her.
[01:02:12.636 --> 01:02:14.538]  She should at least have that.
[01:02:14.538 --> 01:02:18.524]  That's enough credibility to me to say that it's worth hearing from her.
[01:02:19.153 --> 01:02:23.076]  Now, during those hearings, she should be subject to cross-examination.
[01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:28.520]  People should ask her questions that would either show her to be credible or not.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.421]  But look, we're putting a guy on the Supreme Court.
[01:02:30.421 --> 01:02:38.187]  I mean, I find it to be a little bit strange that this comes out 36 years later, not when he was nominated to the D.C.
[01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:40.989]  Circuit, not any time before that.
[01:02:40.989 --> 01:02:46.353]  But those are issues that go to her credibility while at the hearing.
[01:02:46.873 --> 01:02:54.760]  So, I agree with the people on the left who are saying this is at least worth investigating to know who we're putting on the court.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:00.845]  Well, I love the point that she says they're stumbling drunk, and then she never tells anybody about this at this point.
[01:03:00.845 --> 01:03:01.886]  That's not like you're a minor.
[01:03:01.886 --> 01:03:03.347]  You're stumbling drunk.
[01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:06.390]  Even if it's true, people do stupid things.
[01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:10.613]  And so, I just, there's a statute of limitations for a reason.
[01:03:10.613 --> 01:03:14.316]  It's not like there's some long train of abuses by Kavanaugh.
[01:03:14.316 --> 01:03:14.597]  He's got
[01:03:16.499 --> 01:03:18.341]  65 women saying he was nothing but a gentleman.
[01:03:18.341 --> 01:03:19.322]  Why don't they get hurt?
[01:03:19.322 --> 01:03:23.705]  Why don't, you know what, how about they all get hurt and then she gets hurt too?
[01:03:23.705 --> 01:03:38.297]  Well, I mean, as far as if you're trying to evaluate the credibility of a witness, you know, if I could, you can go out and assault one person and then I can get every single other woman on the planet that he didn't assault who says he seems perfectly nice to me.
[01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:43.741]  I think in this situation, it is worth hearing from her.
[01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:44.862]  I want to know because
[01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:51.068]  If he's not telling the truth, you know, let's just look at this guy objectively.
[01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:58.756]  When I looked at him, you know, I only evaluate judges as far as how I think they're going to rule on First Amendment issues.
[01:03:58.756 --> 01:04:03.661]  I looked at him and thought this guy's probably going to be good for the First Amendment.
[01:04:03.661 --> 01:04:07.585]  But you also want a judge who is going to respect the rule of law.
[01:04:08.693 --> 01:04:17.016]  And if he's lied under oath, you know, he's kind of in checkmate here because either she's telling the truth or he's telling the truth right now.
[01:04:17.016 --> 01:04:18.337]  He doesn't have any wiggle room.
[01:04:18.337 --> 01:04:22.638]  He is categorically denied this happened.
[01:04:22.638 --> 01:04:26.620]  So let's put this out there because I also don't want to have
[01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:33.600]  Uh, if he goes on the court, do you really want to have him have this cloud of there was an accusation and nobody... No, I understand.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.061]  Just like Anita Hill blew up in her own face.
[01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:37.762]  I mean, I see your point.
[01:04:37.762 --> 01:04:40.664]  My issue is you've been behind the scenes with me.
[01:04:40.664 --> 01:04:46.228]  I've experienced the New York Times and Washington Post and law firms literally going around paying people to lie about me.
[01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:53.952]  And so I personally have experienced people saying I'm wearing Nazi tennis shoes, you know, and I'm running around the office with my ding dong hanging out.
[01:04:53.952 --> 01:04:56.174]  So, you know, when you've been exposed to something, is it true?
[01:04:56.174 --> 01:04:56.754]  You get a little bit...
[01:04:58.129 --> 01:05:02.251]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:09.315]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:05:09.315 --> 01:05:14.138]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:05:14.138 --> 01:05:22.463]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide water
[01:05:22.523 --> 01:05:23.284]  We're good to go!
[01:05:43.366 --> 01:05:44.506]  All over your home.
[01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:57.251]  Head to InfowarsStore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[01:06:05.496 --> 01:06:13.783]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:13.783 --> 01:06:21.830]  It is Monday, the 17th day already of September 2018, only 50 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[01:06:32.469 --> 01:06:35.891]  And I respect Mark Rondau as a constitutional lawyer.
[01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:38.913]  He's also been involved in some lawsuits against the Wynn Group, all that.
[01:06:38.913 --> 01:06:41.234]  So he's on the Democrat and Republican side.
[01:06:41.234 --> 01:06:46.918]  He's just somebody that basically takes cases as they come.
[01:06:46.918 --> 01:06:53.261]  So I thought, get him on, get Larry Kleinman on, get Tyler Nixon, all lawyers I respect.
[01:06:53.261 --> 01:06:55.483]  Don't call them beforehand and ask their opinion.
[01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:58.553]  Get them on to get it raw on air.
[01:06:58.553 --> 01:07:01.414]  Since we just got joined by a bunch of stations, let me give you my view.
[01:07:01.414 --> 01:07:04.555]  Stories are up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:07:04.555 --> 01:07:15.898]  Kavanaugh accuser is an anti-Trump leftist who attended women's marches, donated to DNC, Hillary, produced pussy hats, you know, did all this.
[01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.758]  Her students say she's really mean, very vindictive.
[01:07:18.758 --> 01:07:23.439]  We've got their comments going back years that she is just a piece of work.
[01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.900]  65 women defend Kavanaugh as a good person amid allegations.
[01:07:27.193 --> 01:07:29.715]  She says she was 17.
[01:07:29.715 --> 01:07:30.496]  She was 15.
[01:07:30.496 --> 01:07:34.679]  They're at a house party, her words, falling down drunk.
[01:07:34.679 --> 01:07:37.781]  I have her in the Washington Post, the original article.
[01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:39.703]  Falling down drunk.
[01:07:39.703 --> 01:07:41.564]  Stumbling drunk's the word.
[01:07:41.564 --> 01:07:44.686]  And that he fell on her on a bed and they rolled around.
[01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.448]  She says, I thought I was gonna die.
[01:07:46.448 --> 01:07:47.108]  That's been added.
[01:07:47.108 --> 01:07:49.470]  And they're calling it sexual assault.
[01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:51.892]  So even if this happened, they're minors, they're drunk.
[01:07:51.892 --> 01:07:55.815]  36 years later, that's why you have a statute of limitations.
[01:07:57.262 --> 01:08:04.164]  My issue with this is that you've got the Democrats saying, we're not going to confirm Kavanaugh no matter what he does.
[01:08:04.164 --> 01:08:07.766]  Now, Ron Dazza at first had looked at him and seen someone as close as he'd like him.
[01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:10.567]  Then looked deeper, said no, the guy's pro First Amendment.
[01:08:10.567 --> 01:08:15.528]  My issue is, and I'm predicting, because I know how they run these databases.
[01:08:15.528 --> 01:08:20.090]  They contacted almost everyone I know in college or high school.
[01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.151]  The New York Times, Washington Post, they had databases.
[01:08:22.151 --> 01:08:24.311]  They went through school annuals.
[01:08:24.311 --> 01:08:25.752]  And they finally found people
[01:08:28.064 --> 01:08:32.605]  At least that it worked in and around me to make stuff up for cash money.
[01:08:32.605 --> 01:08:49.130]  So maybe a little prejudice, when you haven't done the things they're saying, and they've got a hit piece out against you, and a paid-for vendetta by George Soros, literally, that you don't buy this, but why'd she wait till a week before the confirmation vote?
[01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.451]  Why did she expunge her social media?
[01:08:52.451 --> 01:08:55.552]  I think Ron Doz's point will be, well, hear it out,
[01:08:56.397 --> 01:08:58.298]  It'll make for great TV anyways.
[01:08:58.298 --> 01:08:59.459]  And these are the points you raised.
[01:08:59.459 --> 01:09:08.643]  But how do we ask her in the committee, were you contacted by Democrats because you were found in a database to have been in the same town as him and near the same age?
[01:09:08.643 --> 01:09:14.206]  Because I guarantee you, because I know this is going on, it's like the Republicans could find 65 women that knew him.
[01:09:14.206 --> 01:09:15.927]  This is a dragnet effect.
[01:09:15.927 --> 01:09:17.548]  So that's what I'm pointing out.
[01:09:17.548 --> 01:09:19.729]  That's why we have statutes of limitation.
[01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:21.810]  Mark Rondazzo, Rondazzo Group, thanks for joining us.
[01:09:22.773 --> 01:09:25.316]  Yeah, I mean look, why is she coming forward today, 36 years later?
[01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:35.657]  I mean, look, there are people who may have sexual assault issues who just decide it's not worth coming forward at the time.
[01:09:35.657 --> 01:09:37.778]  It's not worth it years later.
[01:09:37.778 --> 01:09:42.982]  It would seem maybe worth it for her to come forward when he got nominated to the D.C.
[01:09:42.982 --> 01:09:43.522]  Circuit.
[01:09:43.522 --> 01:09:48.585]  But, you know, perhaps she let's let's just take this from the perspective that she's telling the truth.
[01:09:48.585 --> 01:09:54.709]  Just whatever you believe, take it from that perspective just for the for the sake of argument.
[01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:55.770]  If she's telling the truth,
[01:09:56.568 --> 01:10:04.073]  I could see her not wanting to bother to come forward until something so momentous as he's going to be on the Supreme Court.
[01:10:04.073 --> 01:10:04.814]  And you know what?
[01:10:04.814 --> 01:10:13.900]  Maybe it's time for me to set aside my own personal... But she's a Hillary-worshiping, pussy-hat-wearing, anti-Trump zealot.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:16.401]  So that gives her a real motive to lie.
[01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:17.242]  That does.
[01:10:17.242 --> 01:10:26.188]  You know, that is something that if there is a hearing, and this is subject to a hearing, she's subject to some cross-examination because she has said she'll testify now from what I've read.
[01:10:27.272 --> 01:10:29.272]  Those are questions I think people ought to ask her.
[01:10:29.272 --> 01:10:29.712]  Yeah.
[01:10:29.712 --> 01:10:34.833]  I mean, look, would it be much more credible if she was a volunteer in the Trump campaign?
[01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:35.373]  It would be.
[01:10:35.373 --> 01:10:51.036]  You know, there are many circumstantial motivations here that you could attribute to why she's coming forward now in this way, in a story that sounds to me to be completely unverifiable, except for the fact that, hey, there was another guy there, she's saying.
[01:10:51.036 --> 01:10:55.237]  So maybe this guy comes forward and says something that tips the scales.
[01:10:57.665 --> 01:11:03.952]  You know, so I just think from my perspective, I like to see the process play out.
[01:11:03.952 --> 01:11:10.339]  This is probably on the very, very far edge of what I would say is worth having hearings on.
[01:11:10.339 --> 01:11:14.263]  But before we put somebody, you know, Brett Kavanaugh is a young man.
[01:11:14.263 --> 01:11:17.747]  He's going to be on that court for the rest of his life.
[01:11:18.722 --> 01:11:23.964]  And I think this is at least worth exploring.
[01:11:23.964 --> 01:11:28.446]  Well I'll just say this.
[01:11:28.446 --> 01:11:33.509]  When I was 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, I've had women plenty of times grab me and throw me on the bed and jump on top of me.
[01:11:33.509 --> 01:11:36.330]  I mean, Mark, have you not had women throw you on the bed and jump on top of you?
[01:11:37.941 --> 01:11:42.044]  Right, look, I don't- Were you sexually- well, let's be honest.
[01:11:42.044 --> 01:11:48.268]  I mean, we see women jumping on top of Elvis on stage, and they're calling this rape.
[01:11:48.268 --> 01:11:49.389]  They're calling it sexual assault.
[01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:54.853]  Even in her statement, they're falling down drunk, he rolls around on top of her, now she thought she was going to die.
[01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:57.475]  Even if it's true, it's just the timing of this.
[01:11:57.475 --> 01:12:03.679]  The Democrats said they were never going to let him get in, and then magically they sit on it for six weeks, and then release it right beforehand.
[01:12:05.285 --> 01:12:15.532]  Yeah, look, I wouldn't be surprised if they waited to have this timing be politically expedient for them at a good time to delay the hearing.
[01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:16.833]  But hey, that's politics.
[01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:21.356]  Have you had women grab you and throw you on a bed and jump on top of you?
[01:12:21.356 --> 01:12:21.816]  Me?
[01:12:21.816 --> 01:12:21.976]  Yeah.
[01:12:23.524 --> 01:12:25.665]  Well, yes, and I enjoyed it.
[01:12:25.665 --> 01:12:28.505]  But, you know, that's a little... I think it's different, Alex.
[01:12:28.505 --> 01:12:31.986]  No, no, I agree, but the leftists say it's not.
[01:12:31.986 --> 01:12:36.548]  But in mammal rituals, if the female rushes the male, he'll just kind of run away if he doesn't like it.
[01:12:36.548 --> 01:12:38.108]  But it's the other way around.
[01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:40.749]  All I'm saying is, I'm not a guy who's ever forced sex on anybody.
[01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:44.311]  And I understand that some guys are into this and I want to break their nose.
[01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:48.153]  Kavanaugh, just like Bill Maher instinctively said, the guy, I don't believe he was ever at a party.
[01:12:48.153 --> 01:12:51.095]  A lot of these women say Kavanaugh doesn't even drink.
[01:12:51.095 --> 01:12:54.717]  People that knew him in high school said he was an egghead bookworm.
[01:12:54.717 --> 01:12:57.779]  And now he's at parties jumping on top of women.
[01:12:57.779 --> 01:13:01.481]  And then, oh, oh, and the witnesses she say were there go, this never even happened.
[01:13:02.338 --> 01:13:06.800]  Look, this may be completely made up, it may be completely factual.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:19.426]  I want to see her on the stand, being cross-examined by the best in the Senate that wants to defend Kavanaugh's reputation, the best in the Senate that wants to tear it down.
[01:13:19.426 --> 01:13:23.327]  That's what confronting your accuser is about.
[01:13:23.327 --> 01:13:24.668]  There's no prosecution here.
[01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:27.069]  Yes, it's past the statute of limitations, but
[01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:36.475]  You know, if this is something that he did, even when he was 16 years old, I mean, I could see them figuring out, yeah, he did it.
[01:13:36.475 --> 01:13:43.176]  And, you know, it being 30-something years ago, he didn't even remember it, so he wasn't lying.
[01:13:43.176 --> 01:13:45.656]  And then people still saying, all right, he's a different guy now.
[01:13:45.656 --> 01:13:46.396]  No, I hear you.
[01:13:46.396 --> 01:13:47.857]  You're saying now they brought it out.
[01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:54.498]  If he doesn't meet it head on, it becomes who he is, his legacy, his destiny, instead of like Clarence Thomas meeting it head on.
[01:13:56.001 --> 01:13:58.644]  Yeah, I mean look, Clarence Thomas did meet it head on, right?
[01:13:58.644 --> 01:14:03.451]  And in those hearings it was... But he at least worked with her and it was 10 years before.
[01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:12.883]  I mean, if they went back 35 years with me, I never threw women on beds, but... I mean, people could definitely take stories I was involved in and spin them into something.
[01:14:13.697 --> 01:14:14.498]  Sure they could.
[01:14:14.498 --> 01:14:24.789]  And I'm sure if we go back far enough and say, you know, there was a night that you were completely wasted, I could make something up that you did, and you could say, well, I don't remember that because I was wasted.
[01:14:24.789 --> 01:14:31.636]  I mean, there's... I remember a few times in high school, I was pretty much reformed by college, waking up in the morning face down in a hallway.
[01:14:31.636 --> 01:14:34.980]  So... Oh yeah, look, hey, I have...
[01:14:35.307 --> 01:14:43.017]  I have had my nights where the only reason I know what happened the night before is because somebody saw it and said, what the hell were you thinking?
[01:14:43.017 --> 01:14:45.080]  I've not been an angel.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.026]  But this situation, we've got a Supreme Court Justice,
[01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:53.579]  I'm at least comfortable saying, let's let this play out.
[01:14:53.579 --> 01:14:58.722]  I'm skeptical, you know, because there are, you know, she does have many, many motivations.
[01:14:58.722 --> 01:15:00.403]  No, I think that's very judicious and fair enough.
[01:15:00.403 --> 01:15:01.663]  Here's my gut level.
[01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:05.946]  They've contacted with databases the Democrats have in the big media, corporate media, everybody.
[01:15:06.246 --> 01:15:09.369]  And they've got other women that want to stop Trump, wound up and ready.
[01:15:09.369 --> 01:15:30.109]  I believe this is all scripted, wound up, and I think it's, whether it happened or not, or something, or there was a drunk guy, he thinks it's Kavanaugh, I'm not, whatever happened, this is political, it's wound up, and I believe they're going to start dropping dominoes, and then every other nominee Trump has, women are going to come out and say that, you know, that aliens abducted him, and Trump was on the, was on the spaceship, and had a big probe,
[01:15:31.591 --> 01:15:38.733]  You know, it does seem to be, you know, look, it's classic Democrat playbook, but that doesn't mean she's lying.
[01:15:38.733 --> 01:15:41.354]  But it also doesn't mean she's telling the truth.
[01:15:41.354 --> 01:15:49.456]  The process is going to have to, I think we're, you know, we're making a bad decision if she doesn't at least get called up to testify.
[01:15:49.456 --> 01:15:51.116]  They better not treat her with kid gloves.
[01:15:51.116 --> 01:15:52.936]  I want to know the Democrats contact her.
[01:15:52.936 --> 01:15:54.097]  I want to see the information.
[01:15:54.097 --> 01:15:54.837]  There's not time.
[01:15:57.475 --> 01:15:59.336]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[01:20:14.588 --> 01:20:21.934]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:21.934 --> 01:20:42.431]  So, it's the classic Democratic Party playbook, and a week before his confirmation vote, Brett Kavanaugh has this lady who 36 years ago says they were both, what was the exact quote, stumbling drunk, as she alleges, and that he fell on her for 10 seconds and she thought she would die.
[01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:54.872]  And then, if you expand on that, she said that she named a man who she said was there, was a teenager, that he basically jumped on top of them to stop it.
[01:20:54.872 --> 01:20:56.674]  I don't know how that does that.
[01:20:56.674 --> 01:21:00.717]  But now that individual is quoted saying that never happened, none of this happened.
[01:21:00.717 --> 01:21:05.381]  So, all I'm saying is, maybe she has false memories, maybe it was somebody else at the event.
[01:21:05.381 --> 01:21:12.286]  We know women never, especially Democratic women, never accuse men of any sexual things that they haven't done, even though it's happened directly to me 110%.
[01:21:14.898 --> 01:21:24.087]  So, going back to Mark Randazzo, I mean, I understand erring on the judicious side, but isn't that why we have a statute of limitations?
[01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:37.841]  I mean, this is 36 years ago, and then you even got Sean Penn, you even got Anthony Robbins, who's a Democrat, you even got Bill Maher saying, this stinks to high heaven.
[01:21:37.841 --> 01:21:38.762]  Why do you think they're saying that?
[01:21:39.397 --> 01:21:42.378]  Statutes of limitations only apply to criminal prosecution.
[01:21:42.378 --> 01:21:46.980]  No, it doesn't apply to the Court of Public Opinion, doesn't apply to nominations for the Supreme Court.
[01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:52.662]  We can go back to, you know, when the guy was eight, if we want to, look at his character back then.
[01:21:52.662 --> 01:21:55.383]  I'm going to say if Brett Kavanaugh raped me.
[01:21:55.383 --> 01:21:57.284]  Look, the Senate, please be careful.
[01:21:57.284 --> 01:21:58.665]  I don't want to defend you in another case.
[01:21:58.665 --> 01:21:59.605]  It's a joke.
[01:21:59.605 --> 01:22:05.207]  I don't think Brett Kavanaugh really, it's called, that's the left suing everybody for free speech.
[01:22:05.207 --> 01:22:06.728]  But, look.
[01:22:06.728 --> 01:22:08.169]  Oh, Brett Kavanaugh is going to sue me now?
[01:22:08.169 --> 01:22:08.929]  That's clearly a joke.
[01:22:09.554 --> 01:22:13.215]  There are any numbers of possibilities here, okay, for this story.
[01:22:13.215 --> 01:22:17.495]  Yes, there are things that make me suspicious of this story.
[01:22:17.495 --> 01:22:19.576]  There are other things I got to ask myself.
[01:22:19.576 --> 01:22:20.896]  Why would she come up with this?
[01:22:20.896 --> 01:22:22.756]  Why would she subject herself to this?
[01:22:22.756 --> 01:22:31.538]  And say there was a third guy there, you know, why not just, if you're going to make up a story, make up a story with no witnesses, right?
[01:22:31.538 --> 01:22:36.159]  But now this guy, this third party that was supposedly there says it didn't happen.
[01:22:37.268 --> 01:22:51.156]  There's a lot of unanswered questions here, and I just think that you can't shove a candidate down the American people's throat with a purely partisan vote and not take this thing seriously.
[01:22:51.156 --> 01:22:57.420]  At least half of the people in the country, if not more, are going to want to know what the decision is here.
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:04.945]  Hell, they might figure out, yes, it happened, and it's not made up, but it doesn't matter.
[01:23:04.945 --> 01:23:06.646]  That might be a decision that we come to.
[01:23:07.461 --> 01:23:15.714]  But when the Senate makes this decision, the Senate has to have, you know, the President picks the nominee, then has the advice and consent of the Senate.
[01:23:15.714 --> 01:23:18.197]  I want a fully informed Senate.
[01:23:18.197 --> 01:23:23.025]  Now, I do not want to see every single candidate have people go back and say, you know,
[01:23:23.775 --> 01:23:25.095]  Well, expanding on this...
[01:23:46.209 --> 01:23:50.011]  Do you gut-level think now there'll be the bandwagon effect and more women will come out?
[01:23:50.011 --> 01:23:59.094]  Because we know that in any big case, you get crazies, whether the case is real or not, or imagined, that start jumping on the bandwagon.
[01:23:59.094 --> 01:23:59.915]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:10.039]  I mean, that's been, look, that's been how politics has been for decades, that anybody, you try to dig up anything you can find on anyone as far back as you can go.
[01:24:10.819 --> 01:24:19.428]  I mean, it is somewhat telling to me if, let's just presume this happened exactly the way she says it happened.
[01:24:19.428 --> 01:24:27.737]  If that's the last time Brett Kavanaugh did anything worthy of being accused of, you know, worthy of being grilled on.
[01:24:27.737 --> 01:24:30.960]  Good God, my problem with him is he's too squeaky clean.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.303]  I want somebody with a little grit on the court for once.
[01:24:34.296 --> 01:24:36.478]  No, I hear you.
[01:24:36.478 --> 01:24:41.301]  Well, it'll certainly make for high ratings on the radio to cover next week if she's in there in hearings.
[01:24:41.301 --> 01:24:47.166]  Do you agree with Senator Graham that if they're going to do this, they need to have hearings immediately and not just let this drag out?
[01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:48.287]  Yeah, let's hear it now.
[01:24:48.287 --> 01:24:53.670]  Let Collard, she's said through her lawyer that she's willing to testify.
[01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:59.355]  And should they put Kavanaugh and her together sitting at two different desks?
[01:25:00.179 --> 01:25:02.500]  Because I think Kavanaugh should be able to face his accuser.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:08.222]  I'm so sick of how they have hearings about me and lie about what I've said in Congress that I can't even be in the hearing.
[01:25:08.222 --> 01:25:09.582]  I think that'd be great.
[01:25:09.582 --> 01:25:11.623]  You know, what are they all doing today?
[01:25:11.623 --> 01:25:16.945]  They can take a day off from running around trying to grub campaign contributions and have a hearing.
[01:25:16.945 --> 01:25:18.145]  So, let's do it!
[01:25:18.145 --> 01:25:18.966]  Good, let's do it then.
[01:25:18.966 --> 01:25:20.146]  Let's raise this.
[01:25:20.146 --> 01:25:25.428]  California professor, writer of confidential Brett Kavanaugh letter speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault.
[01:25:26.670 --> 01:25:38.999]  And they're saying because her husband recalls 2012, where they were in couples therapy, they did not say the name of the person, but said that someone had jumped on top of her when she was a teenager at a party.
[01:25:38.999 --> 01:25:39.860]  So, wow.
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:42.281]  I mean, this is just, wow.
[01:25:42.281 --> 01:25:45.324]  Didn't name the name, but boy, now that's the total proof.
[01:25:45.324 --> 01:25:49.667]  Told a psychologist, but I guess that's not in the psychologist's notes, so now it's just the husband.
[01:25:51.357 --> 01:25:54.303]  Well, you know, again, maybe it's true.
[01:25:54.303 --> 01:25:58.812]  But how good a witness... Don't most courts disregard a spouse's testimony compared to others' testimony?
[01:25:59.577 --> 01:26:04.281]  Oh look, if this was in court, it would be over before it started.
[01:26:04.281 --> 01:26:07.324]  The laws of physics would have to bend for this thing to go forward anyway.
[01:26:07.324 --> 01:26:09.686]  But that's not what this is.
[01:26:09.686 --> 01:26:14.249]  Senators can vote based on whatever they want.
[01:26:14.249 --> 01:26:20.615]  I'm more interested to know if Kavanaugh was lying or not than as to whether it happened.
[01:26:22.597 --> 01:26:24.058]  And he might not remember it.
[01:26:24.058 --> 01:26:30.362]  It may have happened exactly the way she says and he doesn't remember it because it's from so long ago or he was so drunk or whatnot.
[01:26:30.362 --> 01:26:35.425]  But, you know, I would like to see this played out because if he was lying.
[01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:36.978]  While under oath?
[01:26:57.875 --> 01:27:01.818]  Shouldered by a kind of receptacle of the salacious.
[01:27:01.818 --> 01:27:03.920]  What do you mean a receptacle of the salacious?
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.541]  Well, we don't know what's a fact.
[01:27:05.541 --> 01:27:19.973]  In many of the cases, salacious is as soon as you call something a movement that is really a series of many individual accusers, victims, accusations, some of which are unfounded.
[01:27:19.973 --> 01:27:24.597]  The spirit of much of what has been the Me Too movement is to divide men and women.
[01:27:25.441 --> 01:27:28.102]  And that's totally true, and that's the whole plan of the globalists.
[01:27:28.102 --> 01:27:31.324]  And they want to lead the war between men and women.
[01:27:31.324 --> 01:27:33.065]  I mean, that's really what's going on here.
[01:27:33.065 --> 01:27:37.908]  Whether this woman is real or not, I have my right to say the thing stinks to high heaven.
[01:27:37.908 --> 01:27:39.508]  Yeah, and you do.
[01:27:39.508 --> 01:27:47.112]  And, you know, I think that unless she's, you know, she is prepared to testify, let's make her do it.
[01:27:47.112 --> 01:27:49.694]  Or, you know, indulge her in doing it.
[01:27:49.694 --> 01:27:50.734]  Let her be heard.
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:55.502]  At this point, this is all we got on the guy.
[01:27:55.502 --> 01:27:59.266]  This and some, you know, nebulous story about baseball tickets.
[01:27:59.266 --> 01:28:02.329]  You know, other than that, let's sit him down, grill him up.
[01:28:02.329 --> 01:28:13.261]  Well, I demand that her phone records, because she's making public accusations in everything we release, that she hasn't been contacted by the Democrats before this even happened, and, you know, isn't cooking this up, because we know she's being handled by the Democrats now.
[01:28:14.525 --> 01:28:19.307]  If she was contacted by the Democrats before this came out, I don't think that changes anything.
[01:28:19.307 --> 01:28:21.287]  I mean, I would not be surprised.
[01:28:21.287 --> 01:28:24.628]  How does that change anything?
[01:28:24.628 --> 01:28:35.452]  They are desperately looking for any way to derail this justice because they have this partisan belief that he will be the worst thing to ever happen to democracy.
[01:28:35.452 --> 01:28:37.472]  Well, you know, I think they're overblowing it.
[01:28:37.472 --> 01:28:39.433]  I think they're hysterical about it.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.582]  But this is what they're going to do.
[01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:43.144]  All right, Mark.
[01:28:43.144 --> 01:28:44.366]  I think it's blowing up in their face.

[01:28:51.795 --> 01:28:55.280]  I'm going to have hearings about a dinosaur raped me five million years ago.
[01:28:57.714 --> 01:28:58.914]  Hear that?
[01:28:58.914 --> 01:29:04.316]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:04.316 --> 01:29:07.217]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:33:01.256 --> 01:33:19.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.969 --> 01:33:22.630]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:27.774]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:33:34.414 --> 01:33:43.938]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[01:34:02.828 --> 01:34:18.333]  All right, Larry Klayman, one of the few lawyers to beat the NSA spy grid, former head of Judicial Watch, founder of it, is our guest.
[01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:21.174]  And we're going to get into this whole Kavanaugh situation.
[01:34:21.174 --> 01:34:24.975]  You know, I have three daughters, and I know there are men that abuse women.
[01:34:26.104 --> 01:34:47.280]  And I think we should look at any time somebody makes an accusation, but if it's 36 years old, and the person's a Democratic Party operative, and they've expunged all of their social media networks and their Stanford records, and then all we find is Democrat connections, and they hold it to the 11th hour, and then you've got all this going on, I think it stinks to the highest of the heavens.
[01:34:49.127 --> 01:34:55.289]  And I think more women, because I don't know how the Democrats contact all these databases on this holy jihad.
[01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:56.149]  I think this is the beginning.
[01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:58.330]  I think more women are going to come out.
[01:34:58.330 --> 01:35:00.391]  And then no matter what nominee you bring forward, it's going to happen.
[01:35:00.391 --> 01:35:01.511]  It's the tactic.
[01:35:01.511 --> 01:35:03.852]  That's what I think's going on.
[01:35:03.852 --> 01:35:04.872]  Does she have false memories?
[01:35:04.872 --> 01:35:05.673]  Is she confused?
[01:35:05.673 --> 01:35:05.953]  Whatever.
[01:35:05.953 --> 01:35:07.633]  Statute of limitations.
[01:35:07.633 --> 01:35:12.015]  36 years ago, all 30, 65 women saying Kavanaugh's a gentleman.
[01:35:12.015 --> 01:35:13.335]  They don't count.
[01:35:13.335 --> 01:35:14.656]  Just the one Democrat.
[01:35:14.656 --> 01:35:17.817]  And her eyewitness says it didn't even happen.
[01:35:19.332 --> 01:35:22.594]  That's not getting any coverage though.
[01:35:22.594 --> 01:35:24.055]  We're going to go to Larry Klaman here in just a moment.
[01:35:24.055 --> 01:35:29.978]  Please don't forget that we've got a lot of game-changing products at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:35:46.522 --> 01:35:47.603]  Sunglasses.
[01:35:47.603 --> 01:35:48.883]  Just a lot of high-quality products.
[01:35:48.883 --> 01:35:50.765]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of products.
[01:35:50.765 --> 01:35:51.705]  We have Patriot Points.

[01:36:08.806 --> 01:36:17.630]  We appreciate you funding us, making the broadcast possible, but I've had X2, the deep-earth, purest iodine out there, for over five years.
[01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:23.632]  We had a great seaweed-based one that wasn't as strong, and they used sabotage and stuff to get the company not to sell to us.
[01:36:23.632 --> 01:36:24.853]  You've seen what we've been through over the years.
[01:36:24.853 --> 01:36:25.433]  This is nothing new.
[01:36:26.687 --> 01:36:39.586]  So then we got a DEA-sourced company with an oil company that had deep-earth crystals that was used in pharmaceuticals, but it's illegal to sell to you as long as it's put into the palm oil, and it's pure iodine, the good halogen.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.863]  This is the last run because it's hard to source, it's hard to get.
[01:36:43.863 --> 01:36:45.704]  They put me over a barrel for the cost.
[01:36:45.704 --> 01:36:47.165]  We're trying to source some more.
[01:36:47.165 --> 01:36:54.050]  If there is a new X2, it'll have a new name, and it'll be better, or it'll be just as good as this one, but there's no contract now.
[01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.652]  This is the end of X2.
[01:36:55.652 --> 01:37:00.595]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:37:00.595 --> 01:37:04.719]  And we've got a lot of other great products there on the site as well.
[01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:13.679]  Supermale Vitality, Superfemale Vitality is cold press known organic herbs to boost energy, stamina, libido.
[01:37:13.679 --> 01:37:14.700]  Very expensive to make.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.501]  It's like wine.
[01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:16.882]  It's aged.
[01:37:16.882 --> 01:37:21.868]  It's cold press, so it takes four or five times the herbs to produce it than powdered herbs.
[01:37:23.542 --> 01:37:25.604]  And that is discontinued as well.
[01:37:25.604 --> 01:37:28.046]  If we redo it, it'll be reformulated.
[01:37:28.046 --> 01:37:35.273]  It's just that it's so expensive to make these because they're so proprietary that we can't do it anymore and we're working to lower the prices.
[01:37:35.273 --> 01:37:39.637]  So, we have Super Female Vitality, the last run, 50% off.
[01:37:39.637 --> 01:37:41.518]  Super Female Vitality, 50% off.
[01:37:41.518 --> 01:37:42.159]  It's excellent.
[01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:43.260]  It's amazing.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:47.063]  I hope it comes back, but right now, this looks like it's the last run of that.
[01:37:47.063 --> 01:37:48.325]  And those specials have to end.
[01:37:48.925 --> 01:37:55.793]  They have to end this weekend because we're getting close to being sold out of more than half the X2 and the Super Mill.
[01:37:55.793 --> 01:37:59.317]  So we're going to sell out the rest at the regular price instead of discounted.
[01:37:59.317 --> 01:38:03.101]  Super Mill 50%, X2 25%.
[01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:04.923]  Those specials are going to end this weekend.
[01:38:04.923 --> 01:38:06.004]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:38:06.004 --> 01:38:06.825]  Now, joining us.
[01:38:07.622 --> 01:38:08.543]  Larry Klayman.
[01:38:08.543 --> 01:38:11.326]  And again, when I get these guests on, these are respected lawyers.
[01:38:11.326 --> 01:38:13.127]  Had Mark Randazzo on earlier.
[01:38:13.127 --> 01:38:16.771]  He's saying, hey, may it happen, you know, a drunk party, whatever.
[01:38:16.771 --> 01:38:17.391]  Hear it out.
[01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:19.754]  He says it's on the edge of plausibility, but whatever.
[01:38:19.754 --> 01:38:21.195]  Maybe it did happen.
[01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:24.058]  My thing is, why is she expunging her records?
[01:38:24.058 --> 01:38:25.760]  New article just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:27.701]  Good to see you, comrade.
[01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:28.441]  Good to see you, Alex.
[01:38:45.535 --> 01:38:46.977]  Yeah, no, it's insane.
[01:38:46.977 --> 01:38:51.202]  And of course, all of this looks very contrived at the last minute.
[01:38:51.202 --> 01:38:52.864]  36 years old, as you pointed out.
[01:38:52.864 --> 01:38:57.189]  But you and I know very well the Republican Party in Washington, D.C., the establishment.
[01:38:57.757 --> 01:39:01.500]  And they usually run for the exits in situations like this.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:08.325]  And that's what makes this so uncertain because now there's calls to bring this woman in front of Congress, in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:39:08.325 --> 01:39:10.447]  It's going to be another dog and pony show.
[01:39:10.447 --> 01:39:15.591]  The allegations, however suspect, are worse than with regard to Clarence Thomas years ago.
[01:39:15.591 --> 01:39:17.933]  By the way, I love Clarence Thomas, as I do you.
[01:39:17.933 --> 01:39:19.514]  He stands for principle.
[01:39:20.939 --> 01:39:33.454]  But I think his chances of confirmation at this point, because of the reality, if they ran this thing through the Republicans, they believe they're going to lose a lot of female votes in the midterm election.
[01:39:33.454 --> 01:39:40.542]  And I think there's a good chance they run away from Judge Kavanaugh at this point, because, you know, they haven't been the most courageous people, to put it diplomatically.
[01:39:41.107 --> 01:39:46.090]  In the last many years, which is why they're on the verge of losing control of Congress as we speak.
[01:39:46.090 --> 01:39:50.893]  So this is very serious, even though the allegations are suspect.
[01:39:50.893 --> 01:39:54.255]  And we live in this world today, like the Salem witch trials.
[01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:59.779]  There are legitimate cases, like you said, Alex, with regard to sexual harassment and abuse.
[01:39:59.779 --> 01:40:02.681]  I even have some clients that I'm representing in that regard.
[01:40:02.681 --> 01:40:06.103]  But there are a lot that are simply made up and the man is presumed guilty.
[01:40:06.716 --> 01:40:07.837]  Until proven innocent.
[01:40:07.837 --> 01:40:10.039]  So this is a very serious situation.
[01:40:10.039 --> 01:40:23.271]  And I think if Trump does not get this nomination through this time, it's going to be really up in the air as to whether he gets any other nominations through, given what's going on with Robert Mueller and impeachment reports and everything else.
[01:40:23.271 --> 01:40:25.993]  It's not a happy time.
[01:40:25.993 --> 01:40:30.277]  And as you said, the Republican establishment is so not need.
[01:40:30.277 --> 01:40:30.778]  You've got
[01:40:32.691 --> 01:40:35.973]  The Democrats saying, we're not going to confirm him no matter what.
[01:40:35.973 --> 01:40:38.415]  And then magically, this all pops up right on time.
[01:40:38.415 --> 01:40:40.476]  She's expunging her records.
[01:40:40.476 --> 01:40:44.939]  Her eyewitness, Kavanaugh classmate, says assault didn't happen.
[01:40:44.939 --> 01:40:51.283]  The assault claim oozed out of the fetid fever swamp on the left, which has been trying to derail Kavanaugh.
[01:40:51.283 --> 01:40:53.325]  One lie after another, the New Americans reported.
[01:40:53.325 --> 01:40:59.149]  Unable to stop the eminently qualified jurist, Senator Dianne Feinstein sent a stink bomb.
[01:40:59.149 --> 01:41:02.311]  The FBI claiming Kavanaugh assaulted a woman while he was in high school.
[01:41:03.211 --> 01:41:12.077]  The New Yorker, Ronan Farrow, who was chronicled the sex crimes and outrages of perverts in Hollywood media, got hold of the letter and published its contents.
[01:41:12.077 --> 01:41:14.558]  The account is short and lacks details.
[01:41:14.558 --> 01:41:30.108]  But now the man, who she says was the witness to it, has come out and said, his name is Mark Judge, one of the classmates who she says was the witness, says that it did not happen.
[01:41:30.108 --> 01:41:31.529]  So what do you make of that?
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:45.408]  Well, it's helpful, but, you know, I'll talk as a lawyer now rather than somebody in my heart who obviously views this as very problematic and suspect that this guy was involved himself, so you would expect him to deny it as well.
[01:41:45.408 --> 01:41:48.349]  But it doesn't matter, and this is the sad part, Alex.
[01:41:48.349 --> 01:41:49.890]  Truth doesn't matter anymore.
[01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:50.371]  You know that.
[01:41:50.371 --> 01:41:57.055]  Look at what people have tried to do with you, with me, with other people who've had principals who stand up, particularly for conservative principals.
[01:41:57.634 --> 01:42:00.195]  And that's what's happening to Kavanaugh at this point in time.
[01:42:00.195 --> 01:42:05.957]  And now you've got Jeff Flake, the outgoing senator from Arizona, calling for hearings, testimony under oath.
[01:42:05.957 --> 01:42:07.857]  You've got Susan Collins, who's wavering.
[01:42:07.857 --> 01:42:14.319]  You even have Kellyanne Conway in the White House, to some extent, giving support to the woman in statements this morning.
[01:42:14.319 --> 01:42:18.420]  Because the atmosphere... Yeah, what do you make of Conway in the White House?
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.701]  She keeps pulling crap like that, virtue signaling.
[01:42:22.662 --> 01:42:25.407]  Well, the poor woman is between a rock and a hard place.
[01:42:25.407 --> 01:42:27.230]  Her husband's obviously out of control.
[01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:31.959]  I think he's suffering from Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:42:31.959 --> 01:42:35.986]  His membership in the Republican establishment club is in jeopardy because of his wife.
[01:42:36.667 --> 01:42:44.590]  And the poor woman, Kellyanne, and I sympathize with her, is trying to bend over backwards to keep her marriage together with this lunatic that she's married to.
[01:42:44.590 --> 01:42:46.811]  And so she makes statements like that.
[01:42:46.811 --> 01:42:48.332]  And it's not helpful to the President.
[01:42:48.332 --> 01:42:50.193]  I'm sure the President's not happy this morning.
[01:42:50.193 --> 01:42:52.934]  Well, we knew they'd try to stop Kavanaugh, and now they've made their move.
[01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:54.455]  And I think more women are coming.
[01:42:54.455 --> 01:42:54.895]  Stay with us.

[01:47:01.203 --> 01:47:11.568]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.568 --> 01:47:16.311]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:16.311 --> 01:47:18.071]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.979 --> 01:47:31.260]  Constitutional lawyer, founder of Judicial Watch, Larry Klayman is our guest.
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:35.121]  Heads up, FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:47:35.121 --> 01:47:41.402]  He's also one of the only, if not the only lawyer, who's beaten the NSA in the federal court.
[01:47:41.402 --> 01:47:48.344]  And he's been a strident defender of our republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:48.344 --> 01:47:50.404]  I think outside the box.
[01:47:50.404 --> 01:47:53.665]  I look at Communist China, where Apple and Google have moved.
[01:47:55.114 --> 01:47:58.115]  Where they're helping censor their own poor population.
[01:47:58.115 --> 01:48:00.196]  Waging war on our free speech here in America.
[01:48:00.196 --> 01:48:03.438]  I see the left out of control.
[01:48:03.438 --> 01:48:05.659]  All the excesses of Hollywood.
[01:48:05.659 --> 01:48:09.520]  They're real predatory hard-on for the American people.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:14.062]  Think about China with the suicide nets at Apple Factories, Foxcom.
[01:48:14.062 --> 01:48:15.563]  Think about all the things they do.
[01:48:15.563 --> 01:48:21.606]  And they build up this thing about women being abused where there's a mere allegation, like I said earlier, that
[01:48:24.034 --> 01:48:28.661]  Dinosaurs engaged in rape 25 million years ago so we have to blow the planet up.
[01:48:28.661 --> 01:48:31.746]  It just becomes a clear political tool.
[01:48:31.746 --> 01:48:33.489]  And so I go back to her.
[01:48:33.489 --> 01:48:34.650]  Why, Larry Klayman?
[01:48:36.092 --> 01:48:41.814]  Would you expunge your records in college at Stanford?
[01:48:41.814 --> 01:48:46.135]  Why would you get rid of your bios everywhere a month ago?
[01:48:46.135 --> 01:48:48.316]  Why would you get rid of all your social media?
[01:48:48.316 --> 01:48:49.936]  Why would you delete it all?
[01:48:49.936 --> 01:48:55.998]  Because it showed activism, and we caught a lot of it as serious, hardcore Democratic Party activism.
[01:48:55.998 --> 01:49:01.799]  We found a lot of it in the Google Wayback Machine, which we're adding to the article as it's updated.
[01:49:04.105 --> 01:49:06.527]  Again, why not leave those records up?
[01:49:06.527 --> 01:49:07.748]  I think this is all very suspect.
[01:49:07.748 --> 01:49:11.631]  That A, and then B, as a lawyer, as somebody who's worked in D.C.
[01:49:11.631 --> 01:49:14.894]  a lot, how would you counter this if you're the Republicans?
[01:49:14.894 --> 01:49:27.544]  Because, I mean, I would immediately, if you're just going to have emergency hearings on this, I would demand her basically release her phone records, all of it, to show that she's not been quarterbacking this with the Democrats day one.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:36.587]  I was to back up a little bit here, and this is the reality that we live in as we talk about the cowardness of the Republican Party.
[01:49:36.587 --> 01:49:50.781]  But what I would do right immediately up front is to have Kavanaugh take a polygraph examination and let that become public with a reputable FBI polygraph examiner retired and have her do the same thing.
[01:49:50.781 --> 01:49:53.324]  And polygraphs are fairly accurate.
[01:49:53.715 --> 01:49:58.217]  So at least that's one piece of evidence that we could have that would clear this whole thing up.
[01:49:58.217 --> 01:50:01.179]  But the Democrats, obviously, this is orchestrated.
[01:50:01.179 --> 01:50:02.059]  They were planning it.
[01:50:02.059 --> 01:50:04.420]  They hoped to knock Kavanaugh out before.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:06.021]  They realized they weren't able to do that.
[01:50:06.021 --> 01:50:09.302]  So they were holding this back as their ace in the hole.
[01:50:09.302 --> 01:50:17.886]  And it's a very powerful ace in the hole, given the current climate, which is like the Salem Witch Trials out there, where men are presumed guilty until proven innocent.
[01:50:17.886 --> 01:50:21.088]  And again, there are Harvey Weinsteins and there are others who deserve what they got.
[01:50:21.696 --> 01:50:25.337]  But in this day and age, a man has little to no rights.
[01:50:25.337 --> 01:50:26.478]  And they know that.
[01:50:26.478 --> 01:50:37.481]  And they know that this matter is going to scare the heck out of the Republicans who are going to run exit stage left, no pun intended, given everything going on with social media.
[01:50:37.481 --> 01:50:46.364]  And they have a good shot of having this nomination withdrawn because it's going to affect the vote on November 6th in the midterm elections.
[01:50:46.364 --> 01:50:49.285]  There are a lot of women out there that are going to be watching this very carefully.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:55.581]  And with the highly charged atmosphere we live in today, I'd say the Republicans are in the deep you-know-what, frankly.
[01:50:55.581 --> 01:50:58.722]  And the Democrats have outfoxed them yet again.
[01:50:58.722 --> 01:51:00.802]  I don't think they're going to stand on principle.
[01:51:00.802 --> 01:51:07.664]  I don't think they're going to vote Kavanaugh through without, you know, something more that they can hang on to.
[01:51:07.664 --> 01:51:12.345]  And that's why I say both parties should take polygraphs tests right now and make it public.
[01:51:13.035 --> 01:51:16.758]  That's a good point, and we know why they're getting rid of her record.
[01:51:16.758 --> 01:51:20.721]  Kavanaugh accuser, we now learn, donated Hillary Clinton ten times.
[01:51:20.721 --> 01:51:22.683]  Sixty plus liberal groups.
[01:51:22.683 --> 01:51:33.731]  I mean, this woman, and you can see Roger Stone there reporting on one of these shows, if you're watching on TV, they absolutely donated the kitchen sink.
[01:51:33.731 --> 01:51:34.652]  That is amazing.
[01:51:36.243 --> 01:51:37.683]  Well, yes, and look where she comes from.
[01:51:37.683 --> 01:51:39.224]  Northern California.
[01:51:39.224 --> 01:51:42.165]  That's to the left of Beijing, China currently today.
[01:51:42.165 --> 01:51:45.706]  And we know what you've gone through with Google, YouTube.
[01:51:45.706 --> 01:51:46.786]  I go through it as well.
[01:51:46.786 --> 01:51:48.726]  I brought a class action suit for Freedom Watch.
[01:51:48.726 --> 01:51:58.049]  You can see it at FreedomWatchUSA.org against Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Instagram for restraint of trade.
[01:51:58.049 --> 01:52:02.050]  The leftist CEOs of these companies want to squeeze any kind of conservative
[01:52:02.734 --> 01:52:10.701]  Thought, media or advocacy out of the public discourse because their goal is a leftist takeover of this country.
[01:52:10.701 --> 01:52:13.603]  And when they get their politicians in control in Washington, D.C.
[01:52:13.603 --> 01:52:20.169]  and around the states and in your hometown, they get favors bestowed upon them, which are going to make them even richer.
[01:52:20.169 --> 01:52:21.450]  These people are filthy rich.
[01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:27.135]  I was about to say, I mean, the Democrats have always been corrupt out of control, but they have no qualms now.
[01:52:27.135 --> 01:52:30.678]  They are just fire breathing, going for broke.
[01:52:31.935 --> 01:52:34.837]  And they are just psychotic.
[01:52:34.837 --> 01:52:36.698]  I mean, there's nothing they won't do.
[01:52:36.698 --> 01:52:43.322]  I have experienced lies in newspapers around the country that are total fabrications.
[01:52:43.322 --> 01:52:44.402]  People go, well, sue them.
[01:52:44.402 --> 01:52:46.824]  I can't sue 10,000 publications.
[01:52:46.824 --> 01:52:47.984]  They just don't care, too.
[01:52:47.984 --> 01:52:58.230]  They're crazed maniacs, funded by big foreign banks, funded by the Saudis, funded by George Soros, funded by the EU, and they just don't care.
[01:52:58.230 --> 01:52:59.811]  They're just going crazy.
[01:53:00.765 --> 01:53:02.207]  They're Bolsheviks!
[01:53:02.207 --> 01:53:09.314]  And if this scam doesn't work with the social media companies who are not only restraining trade in violation of Sherman 1, I'm a former
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.341]  And I trust Florida's still not.
[01:53:11.341 --> 01:53:14.382]  I helped break up AT&T when I was at the Justice Department.
[01:53:14.382 --> 01:53:16.163]  It's also monopolization.
[01:53:16.163 --> 01:53:19.404]  And if they don't get what they want that way, it's going to resort to violence.
[01:53:19.404 --> 01:53:20.384]  We're going to be in the streets.
[01:53:20.384 --> 01:53:24.566]  We see that with Antifa, with Black Lives Matter, that's going berserk in Dallas.
[01:53:24.566 --> 01:53:25.847]  How do you bring that up?
[01:53:25.847 --> 01:53:27.367]  Because you're an expert.
[01:53:27.367 --> 01:53:30.608]  Let's go back to Sherman 1, Sherman 2, and I've got a big law firm that's involved.
[01:53:30.608 --> 01:53:31.389]  I concur with what you're saying.
[01:53:31.989 --> 01:53:33.130]  People go, oh, it's free market.
[01:53:33.130 --> 01:53:43.201]  No, it's not free market when you go into modern communications and block all the conservatives and libertarians and Christians and then deny you're doing it and then brag in internal documents you're doing it.
[01:53:43.201 --> 01:53:47.146]  Explain as a lawyer how this is un-American, how it violates the First Amendment.
[01:53:47.146 --> 01:53:52.652]  They're going into the digital public commons and basically, like Nazi Germany, saying no conservatives allowed.
[01:53:53.519 --> 01:53:54.840]  It's not true.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:58.103]  Yes, it is a violation of the First Amendment, and we have that in our complaint.
[01:53:58.103 --> 01:54:01.286]  And you can see it at freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:54:01.286 --> 01:54:07.491]  But these companies, I believe, have an agreement between themselves, either explicit by moving to power.
[01:54:07.491 --> 01:54:08.172]  They admit they do.
[01:54:08.172 --> 01:54:11.975]  They've been having secret meetings admitting they need to coordinate censoring us.
[01:54:12.796 --> 01:54:13.857]  That's a restraint of trade.
[01:54:13.857 --> 01:54:17.761]  And you and I are competing not just horizontally with them, but vertically.
[01:54:17.761 --> 01:54:19.823]  I mean, I have Freedom Watch TV.
[01:54:19.823 --> 01:54:22.646]  You know, I republish what I do on your show.
[01:54:22.646 --> 01:54:24.047]  We're getting all this out.
[01:54:24.047 --> 01:54:32.335]  So Zuckerberg admitted at Facebook months ago in front of Congress that he's competing as a media operation as well as a platform.
[01:54:32.335 --> 01:54:36.279]  So there's lots of grounds to move on this in an antitrust way.
[01:54:36.279 --> 01:54:36.700]  And of course,
[01:54:37.330 --> 01:54:40.751]  Our cowardly, do-nothing Attorney General, he's got an Antitrust Division.
[01:54:40.751 --> 01:54:43.371]  I'm a proud alumnus when I used to do something.
[01:54:43.371 --> 01:54:45.792]  He says, oh, I'm going to have meetings with State's Attorney General.
[01:54:45.792 --> 01:54:46.152]  You know what?
[01:54:46.152 --> 01:54:47.352]  You have an Antitrust Division.
[01:54:47.352 --> 01:54:49.692]  You'll meet meetings with State's Attorney General.
[01:54:49.692 --> 01:54:52.573]  Clearly, Sessions is spinning his wheels.
[01:54:52.573 --> 01:55:01.234]  Trump has all the power to stop this, but the control the globalists have of the Justice Department has green-lighted this purge.
[01:55:01.234 --> 01:55:04.515]  Well, that's right, because Sessions has become the darling of the left.
[01:55:05.206 --> 01:55:07.768]  And these companies have stuff on everybody.
[01:55:07.768 --> 01:55:09.409]  They're more powerful than the NSA.
[01:55:09.409 --> 01:55:10.730]  I mean, they work with the NSA.
[01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:13.672]  They hand over information to the NSA.
[01:55:13.672 --> 01:55:17.534]  So they can destroy anybody they want with information that they've got.
[01:55:17.534 --> 01:55:21.497]  And of course, Mueller has subpoenaed a lot of it, you know, from these companies.
[01:55:21.497 --> 01:55:26.160]  And the politicians in Washington are scared to death of taking them on.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:30.763]  It's only you and me and a few others who stood up to them.
[01:55:30.763 --> 01:55:32.284]  And we're continuing to stand up to them.
[01:55:32.284 --> 01:55:34.245]  And we need the support of the American people
[01:55:34.885 --> 01:55:36.726]  As we had going back to 1776.
[01:55:36.726 --> 01:55:40.128]  We need to rise up peacefully and legally, Alex.
[01:55:40.128 --> 01:55:41.349]  Oh, you're right.
[01:55:41.349 --> 01:55:43.811]  Folks don't realize how incredible this time is.
[01:55:43.811 --> 01:55:45.352]  Larry Klayman, thank you so much.
[01:55:45.352 --> 01:55:46.713]  People should support your work.
[01:55:46.713 --> 01:55:48.874]  Your lawsuits for freedom at freedomwatchusa.org.
[01:55:48.874 --> 01:55:50.235]  God bless you and thank you.
[01:55:50.235 --> 01:55:52.036]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:55:52.036 --> 01:56:00.101]  Folks, I mean, I cannot state to you how criminal this is, how insane this is, how these globalists are coming after everybody right now.
[01:56:00.101 --> 01:56:00.982]  It is just wild.
[01:56:03.746 --> 01:56:07.227]  We're going to start the next hour, and tomorrow we'll be taking calls on this.
[01:56:07.227 --> 01:56:22.630]  And we're going to have Tyler Nixon on, and then Owen Schroyer about InfoWarsArmy taking action politically, peacefully, in the streets to get the word out at ball games and church meetings and PTA meetings and city council and state house and federal meetings.
[01:56:22.630 --> 01:56:27.971]  You saw what I did a few weeks ago going into the Senate office building and getting in front of those cameras.
[01:56:27.971 --> 01:56:28.772]  People said, what?
[01:56:28.772 --> 01:56:29.492]  No one's ever done this.
[01:56:29.492 --> 01:56:30.192]  Well, I just did it.
[01:56:31.914 --> 01:56:36.737]  So, the war is now 50 days out.
[01:56:36.737 --> 01:56:40.520]  We'll put that URL on screen for folks so they can go to the Infowars Army.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.602]  It's important to do that on radio and TV.
[01:56:42.602 --> 01:56:45.123]  I think probably the page we built needs to have the URL on it.
[01:56:45.123 --> 01:56:48.126]  That's just one of the things I would do, but that's something I said a few weeks ago.
[01:56:48.126 --> 01:56:50.027]  We'll see what happens.
[01:56:50.027 --> 01:56:55.191]  Now, we're going to start the next hour, but I'm just going to say this.
[01:56:56.403 --> 01:56:57.745]  We need your financial support.

[02:00:29.906 --> 02:00:37.832]  Well, you knew they were going to try to stop a Supreme Court nominee with a great record getting in, who is an anti-gun, who is an anti-American.
[02:00:37.832 --> 02:00:39.053]  You knew it was coming.
[02:00:39.053 --> 02:00:40.314]  And you know they're not going to stop.
[02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:46.991]  But I want to go to a report here from John Bowne.
[02:00:46.991 --> 02:00:49.772]  Are Democrats advocating domestic terrorism?
[02:00:49.772 --> 02:00:54.953]  Well, does a bear trap in the woods is the larger question.
[02:00:54.953 --> 02:01:01.254]  I know that's a silly statement to make, but we're going to go to this and then we have Tyler Nixon, constitutional lawyer, joining us.
[02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:09.756]  And then, you know, I've noticed with contests and websites and things that they have to make sense to be successful.
[02:01:10.603 --> 02:01:21.705]  And you've got to then, like I did with Bill Clinton's A Rapist, you've got to, like, have a site, promote it, and then take what people did so that they can go to a spot and see what they did.
[02:01:21.705 --> 02:01:24.505]  And I looked at InfoWarsArmy, and I'm glad Owen had this idea.
[02:01:24.505 --> 02:01:26.826]  I've had an idea of an audience to go out and do stuff.
[02:01:26.826 --> 02:01:28.666]  But I'm taking that site down.
[02:01:28.666 --> 02:01:29.826]  Because you can't navigate it.
[02:01:29.826 --> 02:01:30.546]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:01:30.546 --> 02:01:31.287]  It doesn't work.
[02:01:31.287 --> 02:01:32.347]  And nobody's bad.
[02:01:32.347 --> 02:01:33.407]  It's great.
[02:01:33.407 --> 02:01:35.267]  We're just not going to pretend anymore.
[02:01:35.267 --> 02:01:39.108]  So we need a site where the people's submissions and the articles are there.
[02:01:40.416 --> 02:01:44.037]  And then you can show what Owen did when he went out and showed what you're supposed to do.
[02:01:44.037 --> 02:01:47.178]  So like, here's what InfoWars Army is, a nation statement.
[02:01:47.178 --> 02:01:52.659]  And we're going to go out on the streets, we're going to do all this, we're going to keep them from censoring us on the web.
[02:01:52.659 --> 02:01:58.260]  You need an opening video explaining what InfoWars Army is.
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:01:59.141]  And I'll do this on air.
[02:01:59.141 --> 02:02:02.301]  I've noticed what I do on air tends to happen.
[02:02:02.301 --> 02:02:04.042]  And so you've got an opening page
[02:02:05.401 --> 02:02:08.724]  Because God love Owen, he's fighting so hard doing his own show and everything else.
[02:02:08.724 --> 02:02:14.268]  But I was just thinking about how important this is this weekend, and I was looking at the page we made, InfoWarsArmy.com.
[02:02:14.268 --> 02:02:20.434]  It's like sign up, send us your email when you do something, and then Owen sees the videos you do, and then it's on InfoWars.
[02:02:20.434 --> 02:02:25.298]  What you do is, you create a site.
[02:02:25.298 --> 02:02:27.940]  And then you say, here's our mission with a video.
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.181]  And then here's our mission in text.
[02:02:29.181 --> 02:02:33.645]  And then here we're going to post below the latest videos and things you go out and do.
[02:02:35.055 --> 02:02:38.196]  And then you promote, you have those folks on the air.
[02:02:38.196 --> 02:02:41.097]  And then you post those videos there, and there's an archive.
[02:02:41.097 --> 02:02:43.377]  That's what you do.
[02:02:43.377 --> 02:02:54.200]  You can't have a black hole page that's just got a, this is for anybody out there watching, a black hole page that just says Infowars Army and you put your email in.
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.240]  That'll go nowhere.
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.441]  It's why we don't do contests anymore.
[02:02:57.441 --> 02:02:59.961]  Over the years, we've bid off more than we can chew, whatever.
[02:02:59.961 --> 02:03:02.222]  And I'm just getting this out here so it stops.
[02:03:03.263 --> 02:03:09.628]  And so I always hear about a new contest, but I'm like, with a contest, we have to watch the videos.
[02:03:09.628 --> 02:03:13.452]  See, I always launch the contest.
[02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:15.353]  No, no more contest.
[02:03:15.353 --> 02:03:24.801]  I have to launch them, there have to be meetings, and then we have to say what the contest is, have the page, and then give power to it.
[02:03:24.801 --> 02:03:29.365]  Where you get it, you promote it, you have them on, and then you've got people all over the country saying Bill Clinton.
[02:03:31.658 --> 02:03:33.319]  Is a rapist.
[02:03:33.319 --> 02:03:35.299]  See that?
[02:03:35.299 --> 02:03:37.620]  That's when you do that.
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:45.483]  Is when you actually follow through.
[02:03:45.483 --> 02:03:48.844]  So InfoWars Army is going to be removed.
[02:03:48.844 --> 02:03:51.285]  Because I looked at it.
[02:03:51.285 --> 02:03:55.887]  And we're going to really launch this in the next week.
[02:03:55.887 --> 02:03:57.608]  And it's going to take the country back.
[02:03:57.608 --> 02:03:58.328]  With 50 days out.
[02:03:59.161 --> 02:04:07.488]  Because we need you to go to city council meetings, to go to C-SPAN, to go to public events, legally and lawfully, go to sporting events, unfurl banners.
[02:04:07.488 --> 02:04:08.949]  Hell, I'll show you how it's done.
[02:04:08.949 --> 02:04:09.930]  I'll go do it all.
[02:04:09.930 --> 02:04:11.271]  I'll do it.
[02:04:11.271 --> 02:04:17.416]  Just like Owen went to that illegal alien meeting at the church, ignoring a thousand troops with guns coming across the border.
[02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:18.938]  He's trying to prime the pump there.
[02:04:18.938 --> 02:04:23.281]  But we gotta have a site where we promote it, not just put it up on the site and black hole it.
[02:04:23.281 --> 02:04:26.984]  It's gotta be on a site where it's all on one page.
[02:04:28.263 --> 02:04:31.204]  That's how the architecture of this works.
[02:04:31.204 --> 02:04:32.805]  Okay?
[02:04:32.805 --> 02:04:35.306]  And then that's how we're gonna get this done.
[02:04:35.306 --> 02:04:37.787]  So Owen is not coming up at the bottom of the aisle.
[02:04:37.787 --> 02:04:43.649]  We're gonna go to rebroadcast after this next guest, and then we're gonna relaunch InfoWars Army for real.
[02:04:43.649 --> 02:04:51.172]  Because you don't give somebody in the Army, you know, those little rubber guns that shoots a little dart out that's rubber.
[02:04:51.172 --> 02:04:53.113]  That's not what you give somebody in the Army.
[02:04:53.113 --> 02:04:54.854]  Poor Owen just doesn't have any weapons.
[02:04:56.243 --> 02:05:00.204]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.204 --> 02:05:03.485]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:05:03.485 --> 02:05:09.747]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:09.747 --> 02:05:12.528]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.268 --> 02:05:17.070]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.070 --> 02:05:23.553]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.553 --> 02:05:28.516]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.266 --> 02:05:33.189]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:40.393]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.393 --> 02:05:45.096]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.096 --> 02:05:51.300]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:55.283]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:07.606 --> 02:06:11.988]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:11.988 --> 02:06:23.392]  Riding down the highway Going to a show Stopping on the byways
[02:06:37.512 --> 02:06:40.915]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:40.915 --> 02:06:42.637]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:42.637 --> 02:06:48.162]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the major websites.
[02:06:48.162 --> 02:06:55.729]  And I want to go to a very, very special report that we have not aired yet here on air.
[02:06:55.729 --> 02:06:57.991]  It's like 14 minutes long.
[02:06:57.991 --> 02:07:00.954]  That is Eric Bolling talking about what really makes Trump tick.
[02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:10.024]  Because I hear over and over and over and over again that Trump doesn't stand for anything.
[02:07:10.024 --> 02:07:21.789]  But you know, Trump does stand for something, and that's free market America, and not having cliques, and not having globalists, and not having these groups that come in and try to control the paradigm.
[02:07:21.789 --> 02:07:25.911]  That's what he stands for.
[02:07:25.911 --> 02:07:31.473]  So, after the break, we're gonna have that video for you.
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:36.321]  And again, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:07:36.321 --> 02:07:43.604]  The title of the video is, ladies and gentlemen, get ready for this.
[02:07:43.604 --> 02:07:46.445]  Eric Bolling, Trump's ideology is America.
[02:07:46.445 --> 02:07:51.886]  Part of that powerful interview will be in the next segment.
[02:07:51.886 --> 02:07:57.028]  But first, these reports are too important, and I mentioned them, so we're going to air them right now.
[02:07:57.028 --> 02:07:58.809]  EU Internet killing legislation.
[02:08:00.691 --> 02:08:03.913]  We're going to air that, that goes after memes, everything else is past.
[02:08:03.913 --> 02:08:07.416]  And then we're going to air as Democrats advocating domestic terrorism, as I mentioned that.
[02:08:07.416 --> 02:08:10.558]  Both these reports are so important from John Bowne.
[02:08:10.558 --> 02:08:16.763]  And so we're going to air EU internet killing legislation right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:16.763 --> 02:08:19.925]  And then coming up, we've got so much more for you today.
[02:08:19.925 --> 02:08:20.286]  Here it is.
[02:08:21.465 --> 02:08:28.868]  Parliament recently put the internet, at least in Europe, on a path towards certain corporate Orwellian doom.
[02:08:28.868 --> 02:08:36.430]  This discussion is bedeviled by all sorts of artificial media twitstorms and hysteria of one kind or another.
[02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:40.552]  There's a very good argument against the lack of democracy in the EU.
[02:08:41.332 --> 02:08:42.433]  Isn't it funny?
[02:08:42.433 --> 02:08:53.665]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.
[02:08:54.924 --> 02:08:57.785]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[02:08:57.785 --> 02:09:15.391]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did is you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe, you have imposed upon them a political union.
[02:09:17.006 --> 02:09:29.749]  Article 11, also known as the Link Tax, forces anyone linking an article of more than one word to a news story to pay for a service that licenses the article.
[02:09:29.749 --> 02:09:42.331]  That news site can, according to The Verge, charge anything they want for the right to quote them or refuse to sell altogether, effectively giving them the right to choose who can criticize them.
[02:09:42.651 --> 02:10:02.610]  While Article 13, also known as the Upload Filter, requires all but the smallest platforms will have to defensively adopt copyright filters that examine everything you post and censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:15.234]  And if that wasn't enough to bring the free flow of information to a grinding halt, typical social media posts like a selfie taken at a football game have been targeted by Article 12A.
[02:10:15.234 --> 02:10:18.955]  No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches
[02:10:19.335 --> 02:10:26.817]  Only the organizers of sports matches will have the right to publicly post any kind of record of the match.
[02:10:26.817 --> 02:10:31.378]  No posting your selfies or short videos of exciting plays.
[02:10:31.378 --> 02:10:32.958]  You are the audience.
[02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:40.180]  Your job is to sit where you're told, passively watch the game, and go home, according to the EFF.
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:45.142]  Also, a freedom of panorama exemption wasn't accepted.
[02:10:45.142 --> 02:11:00.828]  For example, if you take a selfie on a busy street and licensed material happens to be in your shot, whether it's a t-shirt, a licensed architectural design, aka a building, or a billboard, you will be infringing on a copyright.
[02:11:00.828 --> 02:11:01.868]  Also not covered.
[02:11:02.388 --> 02:11:22.362]  Anything we regard in America as fair use, no user-generated content exemption, which would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright for using excerpts from works for criticism, review, illustration, caricature, parody, or pastiche.
[02:11:22.362 --> 02:11:25.744]  EU army to increase ranks sevenfold.
[02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:31.448]  I remember 10 years ago saying there's a secret plan for an EU army because it actually come out in documents.
[02:11:32.428 --> 02:11:35.109]  We've actually gotten documents from someone inside Bilderberg.
[02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:47.513]  They were discussing an EU army to stop countries from having their own borders and that they were going to flood Europe with North Africans and Islamists just out of the Middle East.
[02:11:47.513 --> 02:11:48.293]  It's all true.
[02:11:48.293 --> 02:11:48.853]  It all happened.
[02:11:48.853 --> 02:11:50.794]  Of course, it was real documents we got.
[02:11:50.794 --> 02:11:57.376]  Then a guy who works at the National Archives brought me secret Bilderberg documents the next year confirming it all.
[02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:58.216]  We published them all.
[02:11:59.753 --> 02:12:01.034]  I did get death threats.
[02:12:01.034 --> 02:12:08.417]  Now, but Juncker, when you look at the unelected head of the EU that England didn't vote to enter but they're in, the UK, he is the grandson.
[02:12:08.417 --> 02:12:10.438]  His father was a top Nazi.
[02:12:10.438 --> 02:12:14.821]  His grandfather was the richest guy in Germany.
[02:12:14.821 --> 02:12:15.481]  Royalty.
[02:12:15.481 --> 02:12:16.641]  The Juncker family.
[02:12:16.641 --> 02:12:19.763]  And then you have an unelected EU that was actually a Hitler plan, the EU.
[02:12:19.763 --> 02:12:20.303]  Look it up.
[02:12:20.303 --> 02:12:21.444]  That's even BBC.
[02:12:21.444 --> 02:12:22.744]  I got that in the search engine.
[02:12:22.744 --> 02:12:23.565]  EU was Nazi plan.
[02:12:25.143 --> 02:12:29.527]  And then you learn about all this and it's just like who could make this stuff up?
[02:12:29.527 --> 02:12:40.198]  The intended filter system will create a Big Brother style logjam where smaller platforms and creators will have to face a monstrous bureaucracy to allow content
[02:12:40.598 --> 02:12:43.060]  Or even keep control of their own.
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:49.586]  The EU celebrated the decision with smitten glee, unaware that they are shooting themselves in the foot.
[02:12:49.586 --> 02:12:56.312]  The final vote won't take place until January of 2019, but it is expected to pass.
[02:12:56.312 --> 02:12:57.593]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:17.417]  We're supposed to stand up to discrimination.
[02:13:17.417 --> 02:13:24.226]  And we're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers.
[02:13:24.226 --> 02:13:26.229]  How hard can that be?
[02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:29.753]  Saying that Nazis are bad.
[02:13:29.753 --> 02:13:30.835]  Racism is evil.
[02:13:31.821 --> 02:13:47.333]  And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.
[02:13:48.073 --> 02:13:54.556]  We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal.
[02:13:54.556 --> 02:13:57.697]  We are equal in the eyes of our Creator.
[02:13:57.697 --> 02:14:00.238]  We are equal under the law.
[02:14:00.238 --> 02:14:04.119]  And we are equal under our Constitution.
[02:14:04.119 --> 02:14:06.460]  How many times do I have to reject?
[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:07.880]  I've rejected David Duke.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:08.921]  Rejected David Duke.
[02:14:09.801 --> 02:14:13.803]  I've rejected the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:14:13.803 --> 02:14:16.444]  From the time I'm five years old, I rejected them.
[02:14:16.444 --> 02:14:21.166]  When I put out that I reject the KKK and David Duke, nobody picks it up.
[02:14:21.166 --> 02:14:21.987]  You know why they're not?
[02:14:21.987 --> 02:14:23.027]  Because they don't want to pick it up.
[02:14:23.027 --> 02:14:28.810]  They pick it up, you pick it up, everyone else picks it up, you so... Simultaneously, practically at the same time.
[02:14:28.810 --> 02:14:29.690]  They don't want to pick it up.
[02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:35.853]  Gateway Pundit journalist Cassandra Fairbanks posted this inviting message on her Twitter.
[02:14:35.853 --> 02:14:38.874]  It simply read, who is going to the MAGA meetup tonight?
[02:14:38.874 --> 02:14:45.437]  A response from Dreamstar Justice that, according to Daily Mail, supports the Democratic Socialists,
[02:14:45.717 --> 02:14:52.700]  Responded by saying, I am coming with a gun and I expect to get numerous blood-stained MAGA hats as trophies.
[02:14:52.700 --> 02:15:03.904]  DC police vehicles were spotted outside of the hotel where the event was to take place and a manager confirmed that staff were aware of the threat and taking appropriate security measures.
[02:15:03.904 --> 02:15:14.849]  Meanwhile, the Daily Caller reports, California man Farzad Fazeli was arrested Tuesday for allegedly trying to stab a congressional candidate at a fair on Sunday, police said.
[02:15:15.169 --> 02:15:23.096]  Local media identified the candidate as Republican Rudy Peters who is challenging Democratic Representative Eric Smallwell in November.
[02:15:23.096 --> 02:15:29.982]  Peters survived serious injury thanks to a malfunctioning switchblade, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said.
[02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:39.270]  The attempted stabbing was preceded by Fuseli making disparaging remarks about the Republican Party and President Trump, according to the Sheriff's Office.
[02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:50.420]  Steve Scalise, who survived a mass shooting by a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter, warned on a recent podcast that it's too late now.
[02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:52.422]  It's too late now.
[02:15:55.171 --> 02:15:57.813]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[02:15:57.813 --> 02:15:58.934]  Get back to nature.

[02:16:46.342 --> 02:16:46.682]  GoBerkey.com.
[02:16:55.806 --> 02:16:57.548]  Let's talk tough.
[02:16:57.548 --> 02:16:58.949]  Let's talk comfort.
[02:16:58.949 --> 02:17:01.331]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[02:17:01.331 --> 02:17:04.253]  Made in the USA, blue jeans.
[02:17:04.253 --> 02:17:06.275]  Like you wore as a kid.
[02:17:06.275 --> 02:17:07.155]  Remember?
[02:17:07.155 --> 02:17:10.278]  There's a place down in Tennessee.
[02:17:10.278 --> 02:17:15.803]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:17:15.803 --> 02:17:19.325]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:17:19.325 --> 02:17:22.028]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:17:24.068 --> 02:17:28.760]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:31.767]  Blue diamond gusset's got it.
[02:17:32.669 --> 02:17:34.971]  We're good old-fashioned comfort.
[02:17:34.971 --> 02:17:36.712]  Get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[02:17:36.712 --> 02:17:38.214]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[02:17:38.214 --> 02:17:41.476]  In our Defender Motorcycle Jeans comes Kevlar reinforced.
[02:17:41.476 --> 02:17:44.018]  See them at G-U-S-S-E-T dot com.
[02:17:44.018 --> 02:17:45.459]  That's Gusset dot com.
[02:17:45.459 --> 02:17:45.940]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:46.240]  That's 888-848-7738.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.441]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[02:17:47.441 --> 02:17:47.821]  Others don't.
[02:17:56.141 --> 02:18:16.113]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:18:16.113 --> 02:18:18.235]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:18:18.235 --> 02:18:22.237]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:22.237 --> 02:18:23.258]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[02:18:23.678 --> 02:18:29.482]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:18:29.482 --> 02:18:31.864]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:18:31.864 --> 02:18:34.505]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:18:34.505 --> 02:18:37.287]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:18:37.287 --> 02:18:39.789]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:18:39.789 --> 02:18:48.975]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:18:48.975 --> 02:18:53.418]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:18:53.578 --> 02:18:53.598]  X2
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:02.283]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying.
[02:19:02.283 --> 02:19:05.365]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[02:19:05.365 --> 02:19:07.387]  And so I've broken my contract.
[02:19:07.387 --> 02:19:12.090]  And right now, we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it.
[02:19:12.090 --> 02:19:17.594]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[02:19:17.594 --> 02:19:19.835]  Like I dream of Jeannie in this purple gas.
[02:19:19.835 --> 02:19:23.077]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:19:23.077 --> 02:19:25.059]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[02:19:26.099 --> 02:19:30.161]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago.
[02:19:30.161 --> 02:19:32.862]  So I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:19:32.862 --> 02:19:34.083]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:19:34.083 --> 02:19:36.003]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:19:36.003 --> 02:19:38.344]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:19:38.344 --> 02:19:42.086]  In fact, right now, it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[02:19:42.086 --> 02:19:43.607]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[02:19:43.607 --> 02:19:45.227]  It'll be gone in a couple of months.
[02:19:45.227 --> 02:19:48.149]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarshore.com.
[02:19:48.149 --> 02:19:49.950]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:51.370]  I suggest you stock up on it.
[02:19:51.370 --> 02:19:53.031]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[02:19:53.031 --> 02:19:54.071]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:19:54.071 --> 02:19:55.472]  It's 25% off right now.
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:07.352]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:07.352 --> 02:20:12.399]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:20:14.636 --> 02:20:20.425]  I want you to really talk about President Trump and just who he is and who this amazing success is.
[02:20:20.425 --> 02:20:27.335]  He is everything the left doesn't believe he should be or could be and he's driving them crazy.
[02:20:27.335 --> 02:20:30.260]  They're going absolutely crazy about trying to figure out
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:31.821]  Why he's succeeding?
[02:20:31.821 --> 02:20:40.625]  He's succeeding because he's doing everything that he said he was going to do and everything that, frankly, the Republicans or the Conservatives said they were going to do but never have done.
[02:20:40.625 --> 02:20:50.130]  Lowered taxes, brought regulations down, cutting and slashing regulations, and that's really unleashing a powerful business atmosphere environment in America.
[02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:51.291]  People are doing business here.
[02:20:51.291 --> 02:20:55.453]  And I love the idea that he's got other world leaders on their heels going, what's he going to do next?
[02:20:56.073 --> 02:20:57.614]  Is he crazy enough to drop a bomb?
[02:20:57.614 --> 02:20:58.554]  Maybe he is.
[02:20:58.554 --> 02:20:59.475]  Maybe he's not.
[02:20:59.475 --> 02:21:00.155]  They're all worried.
[02:21:00.155 --> 02:21:01.916]  So I get calls from the BBC.
[02:21:01.916 --> 02:21:03.757]  I get calls from Canadian television.
[02:21:03.757 --> 02:21:05.538]  I get calls from Norwegian television.
[02:21:05.538 --> 02:21:08.139]  I get calls from countries all over the world saying, is he stable?
[02:21:08.139 --> 02:21:08.679]  Is he okay?
[02:21:08.679 --> 02:21:09.940]  I'm like, yeah, he's doing great.
[02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:14.562]  And the fact that you're calling me, it means it's even better because you don't know what he's up to.
[02:21:14.562 --> 02:21:15.683]  That's fantastic.
[02:21:15.683 --> 02:21:17.444]  And look, by the way, he's doing it to the left too.
[02:21:17.884 --> 02:21:18.785]  They don't know what to do with him.
[02:21:18.785 --> 02:21:19.746]  They don't know how to compete with him.
[02:21:19.746 --> 02:21:25.050]  Meanwhile, they can't compete with him because all they have, the whole left's platform is, we hate Trump, you should too.
[02:21:25.050 --> 02:21:27.973]  And that's, you're never going to get elected on that platform.
[02:21:27.973 --> 02:21:28.613]  Well, meanwhile...
[02:21:29.611 --> 02:21:30.952]  North Korea is making deals.
[02:21:30.952 --> 02:21:32.734]  They have stopped showing their missiles.
[02:21:32.734 --> 02:21:34.055]  They have destroyed sites.
[02:21:34.055 --> 02:21:35.977]  They're moving in the right direction towards the U.S.
[02:21:35.977 --> 02:21:37.439]  instead of China.
[02:21:37.439 --> 02:21:38.940]  That's a huge victory right there.
[02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:40.141]  Nobody else could get that done.
[02:21:40.141 --> 02:21:40.602]  Yeah, you did it.
[02:21:40.602 --> 02:21:41.242]  You got that done.
[02:21:41.242 --> 02:21:45.406]  But more importantly, who's the anonymous op-ed writer in the New York Times?
[02:21:45.406 --> 02:21:47.808]  I mean, why did the New York Times publish him?
[02:21:47.808 --> 02:21:48.669]  He or she?
[02:21:48.669 --> 02:21:49.510]  And who is it?
[02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:54.535]  If this person is so worried about the Republic, they're concerned Donald Trump isn't stable enough and they don't like what he's doing.
[02:21:54.795 --> 02:21:59.960]  Even though he's succeeding, that they went to the New York Times and said, don't worry, we have it from the inside.
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:01.522]  We're pulling it away from him.
[02:22:01.522 --> 02:22:03.784]  We're making sure he doesn't do other things.
[02:22:03.784 --> 02:22:04.745]  That's dangerous.
[02:22:04.745 --> 02:22:06.847]  You want to talk about conspiracy theories, Alex?
[02:22:06.847 --> 02:22:07.888]  Where does that guy come from?
[02:22:07.888 --> 02:22:09.570]  Well, that's mutiny.
[02:22:09.570 --> 02:22:11.332]  And the word is it's a consortium of treason.
[02:22:12.072 --> 02:22:13.353]  It is treason, yeah.
[02:22:13.353 --> 02:22:14.374]  Punishable by?
[02:22:14.374 --> 02:22:14.714]  Death.
[02:22:14.714 --> 02:22:15.434]  Death.
[02:22:15.434 --> 02:22:16.315]  Well, that's what's crazy.
[02:22:16.315 --> 02:22:22.919]  It's not like he's, the country's getting better, and then they're saying, oh, he didn't have success, we blocked him is why we got success.
[02:22:22.919 --> 02:22:27.322]  Okay, so you love Obama, and you love the Clintons, why didn't you give us the success?
[02:22:27.322 --> 02:22:28.302]  It's not true.
[02:22:28.302 --> 02:22:29.643]  It's a different economic theory.
[02:22:29.643 --> 02:22:35.887]  Their theory was, you know, let's spread it around, let government take care of you, government will decide the winners and the losers.
[02:22:36.247 --> 02:22:39.448]  And then, on the global stage, let's not get too much.
[02:22:39.448 --> 02:22:40.808]  Let's not get too greedy.
[02:22:40.808 --> 02:22:42.469]  Let's let other people play in the game, too.
[02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:44.009]  Well, that's not good business.
[02:22:44.009 --> 02:22:48.990]  Business says, I'm going to take you out, I'm going to take you out, because we need to win.
[02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:55.372]  In business, you're beholden to the shareholders, not to be a nice company or nice guy, to make money, to be successful.
[02:22:56.332 --> 02:23:00.636]  Trump brought that mentality to the White House and said, we don't care about Mexico.
[02:23:00.636 --> 02:23:02.177]  We don't care about Canada.
[02:23:02.177 --> 02:23:03.158]  We care about America.
[02:23:03.158 --> 02:23:04.619]  We don't care about Germany.
[02:23:04.619 --> 02:23:05.680]  Screw you guys!
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:09.222]  We're going to cut the best deals for America, and frankly, the world's never seen it before.
[02:23:09.222 --> 02:23:11.004]  No, I agree, but I've looked at the deals.
[02:23:11.004 --> 02:23:19.911]  After we had like half the world's wealth, 4% of the population after World War II, by the 60s, the egalitarian liberals said, we're going to parlay America's power into this whole global thing.
[02:23:19.911 --> 02:23:22.433]  So Trump, I wouldn't even say he's being hard-nosed.
[02:23:22.853 --> 02:23:25.335]  He's like, you've got a 280% tariff.
[02:23:25.335 --> 02:23:27.817]  Cut it in half or we're going to totally shut you down.
[02:23:27.817 --> 02:23:29.318]  And then Canada won't do it.
[02:23:29.318 --> 02:23:36.403]  So I think all he's asking for is like, OK, Apple, you've got 200 factories in China built in here.
[02:23:36.403 --> 02:23:38.084]  I mean, I don't even think he's being hardball.
[02:23:38.084 --> 02:23:40.106]  He's like, God, do something.
[02:23:40.106 --> 02:23:41.207]  He's one step better.
[02:23:41.827 --> 02:23:44.448]  Apple, we're not, I'm not going to talk you into Trump.
[02:23:44.448 --> 02:23:46.609]  I'm not going to talk you into bringing a factory here.
[02:23:46.609 --> 02:23:48.270]  I'll make it worth your while.
[02:23:48.270 --> 02:23:53.093]  I'm lowering the import, the repatriation fees to bring money back into the United States.
[02:23:53.093 --> 02:23:58.275]  So that Apple, you do bring the money back here and build plants here because clearly they'd rather do it here.
[02:23:58.275 --> 02:23:58.756]  No, not really.
[02:23:58.756 --> 02:23:59.276]  Here's the problem.
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:01.882]  We had a 40% corporate tax.
[02:24:01.882 --> 02:24:03.083]  It goes to $15.
[02:24:03.083 --> 02:24:04.364]  China's is $15.
[02:24:04.364 --> 02:24:07.226]  They go to $0 if you become state-run.
[02:24:07.226 --> 02:24:11.249]  So you know Apple and Google are moving to China to get the 0% tax.
[02:24:11.249 --> 02:24:19.696]  Then the left attacks Trump and says he's a traitor, lowering it to $15, cheating people, when in truth all that does is take the money out of the country.
[02:24:19.696 --> 02:24:20.597]  Trump's trying to bring it back.
[02:24:20.597 --> 02:24:24.640]  So how do you educate people about what these leftist companies are doing?
[02:24:26.703 --> 02:24:28.325]  Trump's agenda is America first.
[02:24:28.325 --> 02:24:31.288]  They've never been, they've never ascribed to America first.
[02:24:31.288 --> 02:24:35.713]  They've ascribed to America as part of the global leader in humanitarianism.
[02:24:35.713 --> 02:24:37.976]  That's not the way you become successful.
[02:24:37.976 --> 02:24:41.600]  And frankly, when China, when China's economy is starting to slow,
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:43.381]  And we're rising?
[02:24:43.381 --> 02:24:48.405]  That's the time to put your foot on the neck of the Chinese economy so that we get that money back.
[02:24:48.405 --> 02:24:49.186]  And they're doing it.
[02:24:49.186 --> 02:24:50.166]  And I was looking at it.
[02:24:50.166 --> 02:24:51.207]  So how far should he push?
[02:24:51.207 --> 02:24:53.089]  He's already got some concessions.
[02:24:53.089 --> 02:24:54.170]  How far should he push?
[02:24:54.170 --> 02:24:54.790]  Keep going.
[02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:55.210]  Keep going.
[02:24:55.210 --> 02:24:56.952]  Get them to zero on import fees.
[02:24:56.952 --> 02:24:57.792]  We'll go to zero with them.
[02:24:58.633 --> 02:25:01.574]  Bring them up to where they are, and China was here, we were here.
[02:25:01.574 --> 02:25:03.855]  Bring it up, they go, oh my god, you're horrible.
[02:25:03.855 --> 02:25:04.356]  Guess what?
[02:25:04.356 --> 02:25:06.537]  We're horrible, they lower your tariffs, they lower it, we lower it.
[02:25:06.537 --> 02:25:07.577]  But who can disagree with that?
[02:25:07.577 --> 02:25:08.438]  It's level.
[02:25:08.438 --> 02:25:09.678]  Like, we don't play football like this.
[02:25:09.678 --> 02:25:11.179]  You know what the least free
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:19.123]  The least free trade entity is a free trade agreement.
[02:25:19.123 --> 02:25:22.806]  They are premeditated trade.
[02:25:22.806 --> 02:25:24.767]  NAFTA, North American Free Trade Agreement.
[02:25:24.767 --> 02:25:27.609]  Canada, America, Mexico.
[02:25:27.609 --> 02:25:32.012]  When a company from Germany comes over and says, we want to build XYZ widgets.
[02:25:32.532 --> 02:25:37.236]  With you, America, under NAFTA, you have to say, yeah, that's great, we'll take that, but guess what?
[02:25:37.236 --> 02:25:42.860]  We have to farm out some of it to Mexico under NAFTA, and we also have to give some to Canada under NAFTA.
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:49.005]  Blow those deals out of the water, get rid of Mexico and Canada, and go to Germany and say, we want your business, we'll do business with you.
[02:25:49.005 --> 02:25:50.266]  Oh, Canada, you want to play?
[02:25:50.266 --> 02:25:51.607]  Fine, we'll do business with you.
[02:25:51.607 --> 02:25:52.528]  Mexico, you too?
[02:25:52.528 --> 02:25:54.049]  Great, we'll do business with you.
[02:25:54.049 --> 02:25:58.613]  We had all the cards, and then we dealt, gave them away, and in the last minute, Trump was back.
[02:25:58.613 --> 02:25:59.233]  In closing, though,
[02:26:00.074 --> 02:26:04.258]  Because I know Trump's a private guy, you're a private guy, but he does love you, he talks about it.
[02:26:04.258 --> 02:26:05.799]  The person- He calls me.
[02:26:05.799 --> 02:26:07.760]  Regular phone calls from the President.
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:09.262]  It's amazing.
[02:26:09.262 --> 02:26:13.185]  So people need to know, because they're saying he's retarded, he's an idiot, none of it's true, we know that.
[02:26:13.185 --> 02:26:14.726]  Because again- He's not.
[02:26:14.726 --> 02:26:16.367]  This idiot turned it all around?
[02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:17.068]  No.
[02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:17.989]  So who is he?
[02:26:17.989 --> 02:26:18.950]  What's his goal?
[02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:24.034]  I'm going to get off the thing, I'm going to zoom in on you, spend a few minutes on Trump, the person- I think he is.
[02:26:24.034 --> 02:26:25.395]  He's a brand and marketing
[02:26:26.315 --> 02:26:27.756]  Guru.
[02:26:27.756 --> 02:26:35.598]  Quick story, in 2016, when he announced he was running for president, it was right before the big debate with Megyn Kelly.
[02:26:35.598 --> 02:26:42.141]  I had him on the show, and he says something in the middle of a show, and it's a one-on-one interview, and he says, you know, Jeb Bush, low energy Jeb.
[02:26:43.021 --> 02:26:45.923]  And I was like, what's Low Energy Jeb?
[02:26:45.923 --> 02:26:46.683]  This is on air.
[02:26:46.683 --> 02:26:48.164]  I didn't see any of this coming.
[02:26:48.164 --> 02:26:49.965]  He said, yeah, yeah, Low Energy Jeb.
[02:26:49.965 --> 02:26:54.188]  That was the first time he ever announced any of his branding.
[02:26:54.188 --> 02:26:57.910]  Low Energy Jeb, Lion Ted, Crooked Hillary.
[02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:59.471]  Here's what Trump is.
[02:26:59.471 --> 02:27:00.531]  He's a marketer.
[02:27:00.531 --> 02:27:02.533]  He's a brand master.
[02:27:02.533 --> 02:27:11.318]  And he also knows peoples and countries and companies, Achilles, and he exploits them for the good of the country and the good of America and the good of the American people.
[02:27:12.038 --> 02:27:15.980]  And what happens is the left goes crazy because they can't compete with them.
[02:27:15.980 --> 02:27:18.381]  They don't understand them enough to fight.
[02:27:18.381 --> 02:27:21.803]  If you don't know your enemy, you're not going to be able to succeed against your enemy.
[02:27:21.803 --> 02:27:25.505]  And frankly, the left is at war with the right and with Trump.
[02:27:25.505 --> 02:27:27.826]  So he's so good at keeping them on their heels.
[02:27:27.826 --> 02:27:30.067]  All they can do is be anti-Trump.
[02:27:30.067 --> 02:27:31.107]  They can't be for something.
[02:27:31.107 --> 02:27:32.368]  They have to be against something.
[02:27:32.368 --> 02:27:34.369]  And they'll never win being against something.
[02:27:34.369 --> 02:27:36.430]  They can only win being for something.
[02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:37.290]  Trump is for something.
[02:27:37.290 --> 02:27:39.111]  He's for growing the economy.
[02:27:39.111 --> 02:27:40.352]  I'll tell you what motivates Trump.
[02:27:41.212 --> 02:27:47.958]  He's going to go down as the most successful United States president in modern history, and that matters to him.
[02:27:47.958 --> 02:27:50.340]  Well, look, I think he's motivated by success.
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:54.764]  He wants to take credit for being the most successful president in modern history, and I think he will.
[02:27:54.764 --> 02:27:57.126]  And that motivates him like it would motivate anybody.
[02:27:57.126 --> 02:28:02.530]  But if his policies weren't working, he couldn't take that victory lap that he likes to take.
[02:28:02.530 --> 02:28:04.091]  I'll give you a quick story.
[02:28:04.091 --> 02:28:09.356]  It was about three weeks ago, I was on Morning Joe for two days in a row, and I had a real
[02:28:09.756 --> 02:28:13.738]  Robust debate with Charlie Sykes, who's an anti-Trump Republican.
[02:28:13.738 --> 02:28:15.258]  And we were going back and forth.
[02:28:15.258 --> 02:28:17.459]  We got off the second day of the debate.
[02:28:17.459 --> 02:28:18.879]  It was a two-day debate.
[02:28:18.879 --> 02:28:19.720]  And my phone rings.
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:21.460]  I'm in a hotel in D.C.
[02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:23.061]  My phone rings, and it's Trump.
[02:28:23.061 --> 02:28:24.802]  And he says, look, you did great on that.
[02:28:24.802 --> 02:28:25.442]  That was great.
[02:28:25.442 --> 02:28:29.443]  Everything you said was right along what we're looking at, what we're trying to do.
[02:28:29.443 --> 02:28:32.745]  And we talked, and it was really cool that he watched it and he knew what was going on.
[02:28:32.745 --> 02:28:33.485]  But then he said, you know,
[02:28:34.125 --> 02:28:37.409]  This Mueller investigation, it really is driving me crazy.
[02:28:37.409 --> 02:28:38.791]  They don't have anything.
[02:28:38.791 --> 02:28:39.431]  There's nothing.
[02:28:39.431 --> 02:28:42.034]  There's no shred of evidence in a year and a half.
[02:28:42.034 --> 02:28:48.382]  But it annoys me because I've got to think about this instead of getting back to what really matters, making the economy better, making America the first.

[02:32:52.559 --> 02:32:53.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:12.202 --> 02:33:22.255]  Embrace wild conspiracy theories by those surrounding Benghazi or my birth certificate.
[02:33:24.818 --> 02:33:31.980]  The response was, hey, if Benghazi is a conspiracy theory, let's do this then, and tell me if it's conspiracy theory after this, or conspiracy.
[02:33:31.980 --> 02:33:42.103]  Let's put you on the roof, and I said, let's put your ass, cowardly ass, on the roof, and shoot AK-47s and RPGs and lob mortars at you for 13 hours while you left, while you didn't send in your support.
[02:33:42.723 --> 02:33:45.145]  Basically, I just said, what happened that night?
[02:33:45.145 --> 02:33:46.867]  It's a disgrace.
[02:33:46.867 --> 02:33:47.828]  But he's a narcissist.
[02:33:47.828 --> 02:33:48.909]  He's a sociopath.
[02:33:48.909 --> 02:33:49.749]  What else do you expect?
[02:33:49.749 --> 02:33:52.532]  And people are, I hope now, are starting to see that.
[02:33:52.532 --> 02:33:54.614]  I think more people are that are middle of the road.
[02:33:54.614 --> 02:33:56.495]  Starting to see how narcissistic he is.
[02:33:56.495 --> 02:33:57.937]  And he's going to try to rewrite history.
[02:33:57.937 --> 02:33:58.597]  But it's not going to happen.
[02:33:58.597 --> 02:33:59.618]  I'm not going to let him do it.
[02:33:59.618 --> 02:34:00.679]  Especially not in Benghazi.
[02:34:00.679 --> 02:34:02.461]  Because I did lose friends that night.
[02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:04.282]  We did try to sacrifice ourselves.
[02:34:04.282 --> 02:34:04.603]  We did.
[02:34:05.483 --> 02:34:06.764]  To make sure others came home.
[02:34:06.764 --> 02:34:07.724]  And Ronan did.
[02:34:07.724 --> 02:34:09.285]  Ronan Bubb did sacrifice himself.
[02:34:09.285 --> 02:34:10.586]  They gave the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:34:10.586 --> 02:34:13.307]  And you don't, you don't, you don't denigrate that.
[02:34:13.307 --> 02:34:17.269]  You don't treat that as a negative, Barack Hussein Obama, and say it didn't happen.
[02:34:17.269 --> 02:34:20.811]  When guys gave of their lives because you didn't, you didn't feel like doing anything.
[02:34:27.367 --> 02:34:38.751]  Well, we just saw the 17th anniversary of 9-11 earlier this week, but it was also another anniversary of the 6th anniversary of Benghazi, of my, I don't have a teleprompter here, show.
[02:34:38.751 --> 02:34:50.616]  We've got Chris Tonto Baranto, one of the main heroes of the Patriots that survived the tragic event there at the US Special Mission annex in Benghazi, Libya, when Hillary stood down and Obama stood down.
[02:34:50.616 --> 02:34:55.638]  We'll play the clip next segment, where Obama got in a lot of trouble this weekend, last weekend, saying that
[02:34:57.179 --> 02:34:59.981]  Benghazi didn't even have a conspiracy theory.
[02:34:59.981 --> 02:35:01.922]  That's my bad Obama imitation.
[02:35:01.922 --> 02:35:04.664]  Even a lot of liberals said that is next level.
[02:35:04.664 --> 02:35:08.186]  So we'll be talking about all of that with Chris, but you're there in Alabama.
[02:35:08.186 --> 02:35:11.468]  I guess that big old hurricane's a little bit north of you.
[02:35:11.468 --> 02:35:14.831]  Yeah, no, it's a little ways on the Atlantic coast.
[02:35:14.831 --> 02:35:16.191]  We're closer to the Gulf.
[02:35:16.191 --> 02:35:18.493]  It didn't come this way, so I think we're OK.
[02:35:18.493 --> 02:35:20.774]  In fact, I wish we had a little bit of cloud cover.
[02:35:20.774 --> 02:35:22.235]  It's 100 degrees out here and 100% humidity.
[02:35:22.235 --> 02:35:22.476]  It's hot.
[02:35:22.476 --> 02:35:22.816]  It's hot.
[02:35:26.516 --> 02:35:29.477]  And you're out there doing some firearms training with citizens.
[02:35:29.477 --> 02:35:30.797]  Yeah, actually, of course.
[02:35:30.797 --> 02:35:32.397]  I have a company called Battle Line Tactical.
[02:35:32.397 --> 02:35:39.739]  Myself and Dave Boone Benton, Ben Morgan from Morgan Timing System, Larry Stevenson, Larry the Black Bearded Cowboy, he's one of my instructors, Benny Colossus.
[02:35:39.739 --> 02:35:45.340]  We teach people how to shoot and teach people how to defend themselves and be more confident.
[02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:48.201]  It's a great day to be out here shooting.
[02:35:48.741 --> 02:36:00.447]  Well, speaking of censorship, we'll get into the main meat of the interview here at the start of the next segment, but speaking of all the censorship, you've got ChrisTontoPiranto.com, at Chris Piranto on Twitter.
[02:36:00.447 --> 02:36:05.209]  Where are other places for people to get to you if you do get totally banned on Twitter because you just got suspended this week?
[02:36:05.931 --> 02:36:06.532]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:36:06.532 --> 02:36:09.475]  Facebook, I have a public page and a private page.
[02:36:09.475 --> 02:36:11.437]  The public page is just Chris Parano.
[02:36:11.437 --> 02:36:14.461]  You can look for Battleline Tactical, that's my Facebook page.
[02:36:14.461 --> 02:36:16.663]  14th Hour Foundation, that's my Facebook page.
[02:36:16.663 --> 02:36:18.065]  I have a foundation as well.
[02:36:18.065 --> 02:36:20.748]  And then Instagram, I'm pretty regular on.
[02:36:20.748 --> 02:36:23.892]  And it's just Chris underscore Paranto underscore Tano.
[02:36:24.412 --> 02:36:27.394]  I still can't get verified by any of them except Facebook.
[02:36:27.394 --> 02:36:28.155]  Go figure.
[02:36:28.155 --> 02:36:29.716]  So you won't see a blue checkmark.
[02:36:29.716 --> 02:36:33.878]  I'm trying, though, but I guess I'm not important enough.
[02:36:33.878 --> 02:36:34.819]  So what?
[02:36:34.819 --> 02:36:35.379]  In their eyes.
[02:36:35.379 --> 02:36:41.583]  So if you don't see a blue checkmark, just go Chris underscore Toronto underscore Tonto, and that's me.
[02:36:41.583 --> 02:36:42.103]  That's right.
[02:36:42.103 --> 02:36:43.464]  Fake accounts are a big problem.
[02:36:43.464 --> 02:36:50.429]  And now that I've been taken off Twitter and everywhere else, they've got all these fake accounts saying I'm Alex Jones and saying horrible KKK stuff, you name it.
[02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:53.611]  It's very clear that once they silence you, then they can really lie about you.
[02:36:54.485 --> 02:37:00.009]  Yeah, then they can spin and paint the general public any picture they want about you.
[02:37:00.009 --> 02:37:07.534]  Luckily for me, though, and Alex and we all will talk about it, this has been honestly a blessing because people are starting to say, holy crap, what was Benghazi?
[02:37:07.534 --> 02:37:09.195]  A lot of people didn't know what Benghazi was.
[02:37:09.195 --> 02:37:11.356]  And now they're like, oh my gosh, what was Benghazi?
[02:37:11.356 --> 02:37:12.257]  This actually happened.
[02:37:12.257 --> 02:37:13.698]  And here's a guy that was part of it.
[02:37:13.698 --> 02:37:17.260]  And then they go see Tig, or they find Oz, and they see there are other guys out there.
[02:37:17.260 --> 02:37:20.863]  So it's not just me trying to vouch for a story or what happened.
[02:37:20.863 --> 02:37:23.024]  There was a whole team that was left behind by...
[02:37:24.165 --> 02:37:29.130]  This is like Holocaust denial, because they say that I'm denying Sandy Hook, which I'm not.
[02:37:29.130 --> 02:37:31.933]  They just edit tapes together and take it out of context.
[02:37:31.933 --> 02:37:34.195]  But then he's literally saying it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:37:34.195 --> 02:37:36.157]  It's crazy.
[02:37:36.157 --> 02:37:46.006]  And again, as long as there's people like myself, like yourself, out there standing up and saying and calling him on it, calling him on their BS, whether I get banned or not, I'm still going to keep calling him on it.
[02:37:46.613 --> 02:37:49.815]  Good people, because this country still has fantastic American spirit.
[02:37:49.815 --> 02:37:52.777]  Good people are still going to see the truth, and they're going to come forward.
[02:37:52.777 --> 02:37:55.920]  But like you said, brother, and I've been to this before, it's a marathon.
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:37:59.062]  We just got to keep pushing and pushing and overcoming obstacles like we do.
[02:37:59.062 --> 02:38:00.403]  That's what we do as Americans.
[02:38:01.277 --> 02:38:03.018]  When we come back, we've got one more segment with you.
[02:38:03.018 --> 02:38:04.559]  And I know you're busy today training.
[02:38:04.559 --> 02:38:07.521]  You're working seven days a week and public speaking and firearms training.
[02:38:07.521 --> 02:38:08.101]  Very exciting.
[02:38:08.101 --> 02:38:14.244]  I want to get right into Benghazi and what really did happen and play the clip from Obama and so much more.
[02:38:14.244 --> 02:38:19.567]  But just briefly, the 30 seconds we have, what do you make of the big tech giants, Google and Apple, moving to China?
[02:38:19.567 --> 02:38:21.569]  I think it's a national security threat.
[02:38:21.569 --> 02:38:22.869]  And they want to work with our military.
[02:38:22.869 --> 02:38:25.531]  Google, they're helping the Chinese military with AI.
[02:38:25.531 --> 02:38:26.832]  I think these are treasonous companies.
[02:38:28.092 --> 02:38:31.854]  And I haven't seen anything to think otherwise, to be honest with you.
[02:38:31.854 --> 02:38:34.114]  If it's about money, maybe.
[02:38:34.114 --> 02:38:36.155]  Are they taking American jobs away?
[02:38:36.155 --> 02:38:38.056]  Well, it looks like it.
[02:38:38.056 --> 02:38:40.577]  So, just in that respect, I think it's treasonous.
[02:38:40.577 --> 02:38:45.238]  But it's a definite eye-opener for the administration, the Trump administration.
[02:38:45.238 --> 02:38:46.279]  And you keep an eye on it.
[02:38:46.279 --> 02:38:52.261]  I'm not a big person, I don't like big government, but we have companies, private companies that may be- Well, they're involved in espionage.
[02:38:52.261 --> 02:38:53.261]  We'll be right back.
[02:38:53.261 --> 02:38:55.362]  Embraced wild conspiracy theories.
[02:38:57.523 --> 02:39:02.247]  Like those surrounding Benghazi.
[02:39:02.247 --> 02:39:06.350]  Or my birth certificate.
[02:39:06.350 --> 02:39:09.193]  Rejected science.
[02:39:09.193 --> 02:39:15.037]  Rejected facts on things like climate change.
[02:39:15.037 --> 02:39:26.287]  Embraced a rising absolutism from a willingness to default on America's debt by not paying our bills to a refusal to even meet
[02:39:27.694 --> 02:39:34.856]  Much less consider a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court because he happened to be nominated by a Democratic president.
[02:39:34.856 --> 02:39:36.736]  I mean, all of that is a lie.
[02:39:36.736 --> 02:39:40.437]  Benghazi happened, the stand-down happened, a bunch of people got killed.
[02:39:40.437 --> 02:39:44.938]  They used a security force that Hillary was already in control of to come attack the base.
[02:39:44.938 --> 02:39:47.879]  We have Chris Tonto-Piranto on.
[02:39:47.879 --> 02:39:53.560]  Earlier this week, he got suspended on Twitter for countering that clip and saying, no, it happened.
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:55.281]  My buddies were there.
[02:39:55.281 --> 02:39:56.261]  I lost friends.
[02:39:56.261 --> 02:39:57.702]  Everybody knows what happened.
[02:39:57.702 --> 02:40:03.266]  It's come out now thanks to his and the rest of his team's courage and survivors and those that died's courage.
[02:40:03.266 --> 02:40:10.630]  So Chris, you got a chance to respond to the president, the former president, the fact that he just mixed you in with a bunch of other stuff.
[02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:11.551]  I mean, it sounds like
[02:40:12.071 --> 02:40:18.153]  Denying Hitler killed Jews, or it sounds like when they say I'm denying that Sandy Hook happened out of context, I think Sandy Hook happened.
[02:40:18.153 --> 02:40:24.176]  But how dare him say, imply Benghazi, like it's a conspiracy theory, just hoping we're stupid.
[02:40:24.176 --> 02:40:27.257]  What do you think is going on here and how did you respond on Twitter that got censored?
[02:40:28.101 --> 02:40:35.824]  Well, the response was, hey, if Benghazi is a conspiracy theory, let's do this then and tell me if it's conspiracy theory after this or conspiracy.
[02:40:35.824 --> 02:40:36.884]  Let's put you on the roof.
[02:40:36.884 --> 02:40:45.968]  And I said, let's put your ass, cowardly ass on the roof and shoot AK-47s and RPGs and lob mortars at you for 13 hours while you left, while you didn't send in your support.
[02:40:46.588 --> 02:40:49.009]  Basically, I just said what happened that night.
[02:40:49.009 --> 02:40:50.729]  It's a disgrace.
[02:40:50.729 --> 02:40:51.669]  But he's a narcissist.
[02:40:51.669 --> 02:40:52.770]  He's a sociopath.
[02:40:52.770 --> 02:40:53.610]  What else do you expect?
[02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:56.391]  And people are, I hope now, are starting to see that.
[02:40:56.391 --> 02:40:58.171]  I think more people are that are marrow of the road.
[02:40:58.171 --> 02:41:00.332]  Starting to see how narcissistic he is.
[02:41:00.332 --> 02:41:01.772]  And he's going to try to rewrite history.
[02:41:01.772 --> 02:41:02.452]  But it's not going to happen.
[02:41:02.452 --> 02:41:03.473]  I'm not going to let him do it.
[02:41:03.473 --> 02:41:04.513]  Especially not in Benghazi.
[02:41:04.513 --> 02:41:06.273]  Because I did lose friends that night.
[02:41:06.273 --> 02:41:08.134]  We did try to sacrifice ourselves.
[02:41:08.134 --> 02:41:08.434]  We did.
[02:41:09.322 --> 02:41:10.623]  To make sure others came home.
[02:41:10.623 --> 02:41:11.583]  And Ronan did.
[02:41:11.583 --> 02:41:13.123]  Ronan Buck did sacrifice himself.
[02:41:13.123 --> 02:41:14.444]  They gave the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:41:14.444 --> 02:41:17.165]  And you don't, you don't, you don't denigrate that.
[02:41:17.165 --> 02:41:21.126]  You don't treat that as a negative, Barack Hussein Obama, and say it didn't happen.
[02:41:21.126 --> 02:41:24.747]  When guys gave of their lives because you didn't, you didn't feel like doing anything.
[02:41:25.728 --> 02:41:27.309]  But there's so many levels to this.
[02:41:27.309 --> 02:41:31.950]  He is the jerk with Hillary that left you there for 13 hours.
[02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:35.631]  And I've talked to a lot of folks like Colonel Schaefer and others, evidence that they knew what was going on.
[02:41:35.631 --> 02:41:39.453]  We're trying to get the weapons to Al Qaeda and ISIS, which has now been basically confirmed.
[02:41:39.453 --> 02:41:40.773]  So let's just say it.
[02:41:41.013 --> 02:41:42.414]  Everybody else stood down, ran off.
[02:41:42.414 --> 02:41:44.995]  You guys didn't get the word, refused to stand down.
[02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:47.096]  They sent people there to kill everybody.
[02:41:47.096 --> 02:41:55.641]  It didn't work, so here's the guy that bare minimum through negligence almost got you guys killed, got some of your buddies killed, and then he's gonna rub it in and tell you it didn't happen.
[02:41:56.525 --> 02:42:01.308]  It didn't because they easily manipulated are going to try to believe they're going to believe him.
[02:42:01.308 --> 02:42:06.892]  If you don't have any sort of common sense, you're going to believe what your Messiah says.
[02:42:06.892 --> 02:42:10.134]  And a lot of people still hold him in that regard.
[02:42:10.134 --> 02:42:11.255]  I love Donald Trump Jr.
[02:42:11.255 --> 02:42:12.055]  when he said he helped.
[02:42:12.055 --> 02:42:12.916]  He did support me on it.
[02:42:12.916 --> 02:42:15.617]  He said, yeah, Barack Obama's negligent homicide.
[02:42:15.617 --> 02:42:16.258]  Well, it was.
[02:42:18.019 --> 02:42:22.684]  You know that this is a blessing with us getting banned because now it's waking people up to what's actually going on.
[02:42:22.684 --> 02:42:25.266]  And we just got to keep fighting, fighting the good fight, brother.
[02:42:25.266 --> 02:42:26.067]  That's all we can do.
[02:42:26.067 --> 02:42:32.654]  And if he says something like that again, I'll come out and say it and I'll report in kind again and put him in his place.
[02:42:32.654 --> 02:42:33.454]  That's what needs to be done.
[02:42:34.275 --> 02:42:39.117]  Well, they started telling us, you better, you know, not get involved in the campaign or support Republicans.
[02:42:39.117 --> 02:42:39.697]  We're going to ban you.
[02:42:39.697 --> 02:42:41.038]  I mean, we got the messages.
[02:42:41.038 --> 02:42:41.838]  We didn't back down.
[02:42:41.838 --> 02:42:42.638]  They banned us.
[02:42:42.638 --> 02:42:45.039]  It's totally blown up in their face.
[02:42:45.039 --> 02:42:46.760]  And now Google's under investigation.
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:47.740]  Facebook is.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:50.922]  Apple, again, has moved to China.
[02:42:50.922 --> 02:42:54.123]  Both those companies won't work with the Pentagon on AI.
[02:42:54.123 --> 02:42:55.243]  They're giving the Chinese... X2.
[02:42:56.684 --> 02:43:01.428]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and that was what we were buying.
[02:43:01.428 --> 02:43:04.510]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[02:43:04.510 --> 02:43:06.532]  And so I've broken my contract.
[02:43:06.532 --> 02:43:11.235]  And right now, we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it.
[02:43:11.235 --> 02:43:16.740]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peeker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[02:43:16.740 --> 02:43:18.061]  Like I dream of Jeannie in this.
[02:43:18.061 --> 02:43:18.881]  It's purple gas.
[02:43:18.881 --> 02:43:22.244]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:43:22.244 --> 02:43:24.406]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[02:43:25.246 --> 02:43:27.628]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[02:43:27.628 --> 02:43:29.309]  Ordered it six months ago.
[02:43:29.309 --> 02:43:30.290]  So I get the price down.
[02:43:30.290 --> 02:43:32.011]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:43:32.011 --> 02:43:33.232]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:43:33.232 --> 02:43:35.153]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[02:43:35.153 --> 02:43:37.494]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[02:43:37.494 --> 02:43:41.237]  In fact, right now, it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[02:43:41.237 --> 02:43:42.678]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[02:43:42.678 --> 02:43:44.619]  It'll be gone a couple months.
[02:43:44.619 --> 02:43:47.301]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.
[02:43:47.301 --> 02:43:49.102]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.

[02:45:55.580 --> 02:46:03.299]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:46:03.299 --> 02:46:03.760]  It's you!
[02:46:04.864 --> 02:46:07.047]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.047 --> 02:46:15.797]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:15.797 --> 02:46:20.362]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:20.362 --> 02:46:21.823]  You are the info war.
[02:46:21.823 --> 02:46:25.347]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.008 --> 02:46:37.391]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:37.391 --> 02:46:45.373]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:45.373 --> 02:46:52.415]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.415 --> 02:46:55.156]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.823]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:26.848 --> 02:47:30.950]  They started telling us, you better, you know, not get involved in the campaign or support Republicans.
[02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:31.530]  We're going to ban you.
[02:47:31.530 --> 02:47:32.870]  I mean, we got the messages.
[02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:33.671]  We didn't back down.
[02:47:33.671 --> 02:47:34.471]  They banned us.
[02:47:34.471 --> 02:47:36.872]  It's totally blown up in their face.
[02:47:36.872 --> 02:47:38.593]  And now Google's under investigation.
[02:47:38.593 --> 02:47:39.573]  Facebook is.
[02:47:39.573 --> 02:47:41.213]  Apple, again, has moved to China.
[02:47:43.695 --> 02:47:50.660]  Both those companies won't work with the Pentagon on AI, but they're giving the Chinese military our AI, who when we all know DARPA set up Google.
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:52.742]  I'm a free market guy, when you're free market.
[02:47:52.742 --> 02:48:00.648]  But these companies are operating, a lot of them are bigger than major nations, their GDP, like a foreign army allied with foreign enemies that are authoritarians.
[02:48:00.648 --> 02:48:04.250]  And I just think we need to have serious move on these folks.
[02:48:04.250 --> 02:48:08.474]  I can tell people the White House and patriots of this government are looking at it.
[02:48:08.474 --> 02:48:11.336]  I was in Congress last week and saw Senator Cotton talk about
[02:48:11.696 --> 02:48:13.877]  You know, does Google need to get SWAT teamed?
[02:48:13.877 --> 02:48:21.082]  Because, I mean, the stuff they're doing is not just the censorship, but just the rampant working with dictators and then moving to China.
[02:48:21.082 --> 02:48:22.023]  It really gets me concerned.
[02:48:22.978 --> 02:48:34.689]  Well, this is again where the administration and Mr. Cotton, of course, Senator Congressman Cotton, Senator Cotton, gentlemen like that need to stay on the ball like they are.
[02:48:34.689 --> 02:48:39.774]  As far as utilizing force with these companies, that's a, hey, that's higher levels than me.
[02:48:39.774 --> 02:48:40.735]  I used to do that.
[02:48:40.735 --> 02:48:41.616]  I don't do that anymore.
[02:48:43.156 --> 02:48:44.117]  I'm not calling for that.
[02:48:44.117 --> 02:48:53.141]  I'm saying, what will we do in 1939 if we found out Hitler had taken control of all our major companies and was censoring Americans and telling us, how Hitler?
[02:48:53.141 --> 02:48:56.582]  We would go to those companies and tell those executives, knock it off right now.
[02:48:56.582 --> 02:49:02.045]  Instead, have you seen where Google, this year, told the Pentagon, we're not helping you with anything, okay?
[02:49:02.045 --> 02:49:04.726]  And then they ran over and are working with the Chinese government.
[02:49:05.842 --> 02:49:08.864]  If we can get, and we got a good president that can handle this.
[02:49:08.864 --> 02:49:10.065]  I really believe he can.
[02:49:10.065 --> 02:49:13.107]  It's just we need to get, Jeff Sessions needs to go, brother.
[02:49:13.107 --> 02:49:21.192]  If we can get somebody within the Justice Department that has a set of balls that will do something, then we can start to move forward.
[02:49:21.192 --> 02:49:25.995]  But by you seeing it, by me seeing it, by the general populace seeing it, don't think Donald Trump doesn't see it.
[02:49:25.995 --> 02:49:26.896]  President Trump doesn't see it.
[02:49:27.336 --> 02:49:28.697]  We're moving forward in that direction.
[02:49:28.697 --> 02:49:32.100]  And by you continually talking about it, we continue to take the fight to them.
[02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:33.020]  And that's all we can do.
[02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:35.982]  We can only do that until the President says, you know what?
[02:49:35.982 --> 02:49:36.883]  This is what I have.
[02:49:36.883 --> 02:49:38.104]  This is black and white.
[02:49:38.104 --> 02:49:39.145]  It's not subjective.
[02:49:39.145 --> 02:49:40.386]  This is objective of what they're doing.
[02:49:40.386 --> 02:49:42.627]  They're being treated as if they're writing espionage.
[02:49:42.627 --> 02:49:49.072]  We're going to go ahead and deal with them accordingly based off our justice system, based off the Constitution and what they shouldn't be doing.
[02:49:49.172 --> 02:49:53.695]  By the way, I was told this by high-level sources at the Pentagon and in the White House last week.
[02:49:53.695 --> 02:49:55.297]  And I said it last week, people now see it.
[02:49:55.297 --> 02:49:57.098]  It's not five top engineers.
[02:49:57.098 --> 02:49:59.900]  Hundreds have left over this.
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:07.926]  And it's in mainstream news today that their top engineer quit, a Bolson, and said, you are aiding and abetting an authoritarian regime rounding up and killing their people.
[02:50:07.926 --> 02:50:10.368]  He said, this is treason.
[02:50:10.368 --> 02:50:11.409]  And so more and more.
[02:50:11.409 --> 02:50:16.573]  And then you've got John Kerry secretly meeting with the Iranians to undermine our
[02:50:17.353 --> 02:50:19.195]  Our government, that's illegal!
[02:50:19.195 --> 02:50:24.659]  If I went to Iran and tried to negate US policy, I can do that here as a citizen?
[02:50:24.659 --> 02:50:27.942]  I can't go to Iran, I go under the prison!
[02:50:27.942 --> 02:50:36.849]  Yeah, if these guys, these politicians, they all feel like they're above the law because of the last 8 years, maybe even the last 16 years.
[02:50:36.849 --> 02:50:38.290]  If they would be held accountable.
[02:50:39.147 --> 02:50:40.068]  This would stop.
[02:50:40.068 --> 02:50:40.628]  One of them.
[02:50:40.628 --> 02:50:41.409]  Be held accountable.
[02:50:41.409 --> 02:50:43.970]  This would stop.
[02:50:43.970 --> 02:50:46.832]  That's where, again, where I talk about Jeff Sessions needs to go.
[02:50:46.832 --> 02:50:52.436]  We've got to get somebody in the Justice Department that has some balls, has some teeth, that's willing to take it to these people.
[02:50:52.436 --> 02:50:58.120]  Until then, you're still going to see a lot of these politicians, these liberal politicians, undermine the United States of America.
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:50:58.920]  And we're seeing it.
[02:50:58.920 --> 02:50:59.781]  You're pointing it out.
[02:50:59.781 --> 02:51:02.903]  But if I ask you to continue pointing it out, we're still taking the fight to them.
[02:51:02.903 --> 02:51:05.444]  And that's what we have to do to stay positive to keep doing it.
[02:51:05.444 --> 02:51:06.145]  It's necessary.
[02:51:06.385 --> 02:51:07.246]  Well, Chris, I agree.
[02:51:07.246 --> 02:51:11.668]  And I think because of the lawlessness and above-the-law arrogance, these companies are crazy.
[02:51:11.668 --> 02:51:13.890]  I mean, I read the stuff they're doing that's admitted.
[02:51:13.890 --> 02:51:16.071]  I can't even believe it.
[02:51:16.071 --> 02:51:20.174]  And I didn't even know they were having hearings specifically admitting that China's taking over.
[02:51:20.174 --> 02:51:23.016]  I was actually pleased to hear some of the committee talking about that.
[02:51:23.016 --> 02:51:24.237]  And we only have a few minutes left.
[02:51:24.237 --> 02:51:25.738]  Please come back for a full 30 minutes to an hour.
[02:51:25.738 --> 02:51:27.479]  Soon you're going to finish teaching your class.
[02:51:27.479 --> 02:51:32.302]  But other points you'd like to add to the listeners, the viewers, just about
[02:51:33.022 --> 02:51:38.225]  The other survivors of Benghazi, what they thought of Obama saying, nothing happened to you, you don't exist.
[02:51:38.225 --> 02:51:42.047]  Well, of course, take one on Fox and he retorted as well.
[02:51:42.047 --> 02:51:43.108]  We all are pissed.
[02:51:43.108 --> 02:51:44.509]  We all get angry.
[02:51:44.509 --> 02:51:48.471]  And I don't want, because I don't know if Baha is out there teaching right now.
[02:51:48.471 --> 02:51:51.993]  Every one of us, you know, every one of us gets pissed off about it.
[02:51:51.993 --> 02:51:54.635]  Every one of us wants to tell it to his face.
[02:51:54.635 --> 02:51:56.556]  Hey, you know what?
[02:51:56.556 --> 02:51:57.056]  Stop.
[02:51:57.056 --> 02:51:58.477]  Just shut your mouth, Obama.
[02:51:58.477 --> 02:51:59.417]  Stop talking about it.
[02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:27.481]  So, we gotta stay positive, gotta keep fighting, gotta keep moving forward, and I know I've said it a million times, because the only way we can win this fight is by continually pointing out the corruption, and the liberal hypocrisy, and the left lies, and the corporations that are under their umbrella that are lying for them, like Twitter, like Google, like Apple, and hopefully, which I'm seeing, I think I'm seeing it, the American public will voice their displeasure with it, and
[02:52:28.121 --> 02:52:33.066]  The president will take it upon his back to correct these groups and bring them to justice.
[02:52:33.066 --> 02:52:34.767]  Bring these diplomats.
[02:52:34.767 --> 02:52:37.169]  Gotta start bringing diplomats in.
[02:52:37.169 --> 02:52:43.115]  These ex-politicians like John Kerry that are doing things illegally and violating national security.
[02:52:43.115 --> 02:52:46.618]  And like Hillary Clinton who violated national security and holding him accountable.
[02:52:46.618 --> 02:52:48.200]  Make an example out of him and it will stop.
[02:52:49.821 --> 02:52:50.722]  Globalism is treason.
[02:53:14.824 --> 02:53:18.786]  Globalism is espionage, not being a world citizen.
[02:53:18.786 --> 02:53:19.366]  I'm all for that.
[02:53:19.366 --> 02:53:21.827]  I'm all for internationalism, people working together.
[02:53:21.827 --> 02:53:29.450]  Globalism is a world system of control, taking nation-state power away and transferring it to a, quote, global technocracy.
[02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:31.171]  That's in the words of the Davos group themselves.
[02:53:31.171 --> 02:53:38.014]  They had a vote five years ago and said, we are a technocracy, and we believe in the abolishment of elected leaders.
[02:53:38.014 --> 02:53:39.355]  We want technocrats in place.
[02:53:40.455 --> 02:53:43.097]  So I'm saying, I'm all for not having government regulation.
[02:53:43.097 --> 02:53:43.697]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:53:43.697 --> 02:53:51.763]  But when you have big corporations working with dictatorships like China to destroy our free speech, to sell us out, this is about survival.
[02:53:51.763 --> 02:53:53.324]  I don't want to take Google over and have it be state run.
[02:53:53.324 --> 02:53:58.687]  I want to have it taken over and then be transparent and not be working with dictatorships.
[02:53:58.687 --> 02:54:00.068]  Just don't.
[02:54:00.068 --> 02:54:02.210]  Again, it's one thing to move there and work with dictatorships.
[02:54:02.210 --> 02:54:02.790]  That's bad enough.
[02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:07.393]  Once you start trying to make America a dictatorship, as their own engineers say, that's when you jump the shark.
[02:54:07.393 --> 02:54:09.034]  He said his teams just went to lunch.
[02:54:09.034 --> 02:54:09.955]  He didn't know they were going to go early.
[02:54:10.895 --> 02:54:12.957]  Well, the Liberals, they really bid on that.
[02:54:12.957 --> 02:54:16.199]  I was asked on Fox, how do you feel when he said Benghazi was a conspiracy?
[02:54:40.174 --> 02:54:41.315]  How do you think I felt?
[02:54:41.315 --> 02:54:44.457]  I was left behind by Barack Obama.
[02:54:44.457 --> 02:54:45.598]  The team was left behind.
[02:54:45.598 --> 02:54:47.158]  13 hours, 4 on.
[02:54:47.158 --> 02:54:47.959]  We lost people.
[02:54:47.959 --> 02:54:48.439]  They died.
[02:54:48.439 --> 02:54:49.460]  We continued to fight.
[02:54:49.460 --> 02:54:50.621]  We tried to save people.
[02:54:50.621 --> 02:54:55.504]  We saved over, including mine, if you count my life and the team's lives, we saved over 30 people's lives.
[02:54:56.124 --> 02:54:59.166]  Um, and then we come home, and then we're called liars.
[02:54:59.166 --> 02:55:00.887]  And the story's spun out of control.
[02:55:00.887 --> 02:55:05.310]  And you know, and people are like, what I did after that, you all, you had one write a book, you want to write a movie?
[02:55:05.310 --> 02:55:06.091]  No!
[02:55:06.091 --> 02:55:06.851]  I went to Yemen.
[02:55:06.851 --> 02:55:08.172]  I continue to serve my country.
[02:55:08.172 --> 02:55:10.714]  Because I love the United States of America.
[02:55:10.714 --> 02:55:15.297]  It was after eight months of being called a liar, and seeing him spin it, that finally it's out of control.
[02:55:15.297 --> 02:55:18.019]  So how do you think I'm gonna feel when you say, how do you, how do you feel right now?
[02:55:18.019 --> 02:55:19.800]  Well, I want to reach through the screen and choke him.
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:21.721]  Does that mean I want to kill the former president?
[02:55:21.721 --> 02:55:21.961]  No!
[02:55:21.961 --> 02:55:24.103]  I, I, I don't have time for that.
[02:55:24.103 --> 02:55:25.764]  I've much, people have taken lives,
[02:55:26.384 --> 02:55:31.325]  It's a metaphor that he literally got your friends killed and lied about it with Hillary and now he says you don't exist.
[02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:47.511]  How do you think that's going to make me feel?
[02:55:47.511 --> 02:55:52.056]  Of course it makes my blood boil because it's just disgusting.
[02:55:52.056 --> 02:55:53.617]  And it means that he doesn't care.
[02:55:53.617 --> 02:55:55.279]  He doesn't care anything about it.
[02:55:55.279 --> 02:55:58.203]  Why can't he embrace you guys and say, sorry, things broke down?
[02:55:58.203 --> 02:56:00.165]  Because they know they ordered the stand down.
[02:56:00.165 --> 02:56:01.006]  You don't stand down 13 hours.
[02:56:02.782 --> 02:56:06.865]  That is what, Alex, that is what I said to him when I came back from Yemen.
[02:56:06.865 --> 02:56:16.131]  I said, if you guys behind closed doors talking to my CIA personnel, my leadership of the CIA, if you can just tell me you're sorry, you don't even need to make it public.
[02:56:16.131 --> 02:56:19.193]  Just tell me you're sorry and I will go away and I'll go back to work.
[02:56:19.193 --> 02:56:20.614]  They couldn't even do that.
[02:56:20.614 --> 02:56:21.914]  That's narcissism, brother.
[02:56:21.914 --> 02:56:23.195]  That's pride talking.
[02:56:23.195 --> 02:56:24.496]  And that's evil.
[02:56:24.496 --> 02:56:25.677]  That's the devil.
[02:56:25.677 --> 02:56:27.038]  That's what we're up against.
[02:56:27.038 --> 02:56:30.320]  And they want to quote me on that or use that as a talking point, fine.
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:31.721]  But as people are seeing now,
[02:56:32.461 --> 02:56:34.524]  Essentially, that is what we're up against right now.
[02:56:34.524 --> 02:56:35.606]  It's just pure evil.
[02:56:35.606 --> 02:56:37.949]  Pure evil.
[02:56:37.949 --> 02:56:38.991]  What do you make of...
[02:56:40.239 --> 02:56:44.081]  The way they call the President a Nazi and they say, remove him, 25th Amendment.
[02:56:44.081 --> 02:56:48.182]  And he says, lying fake news is the enemy of the people.
[02:56:48.182 --> 02:56:51.143]  And then they lie and go, he says the First Amendment's the enemy of the people.
[02:56:51.143 --> 02:56:52.624]  He's not censoring media.
[02:56:52.624 --> 02:56:58.606]  They're the ones censoring all of us and calling him, for him to be removed and calling for his kids to be kidnapped and raped.
[02:56:58.606 --> 02:57:00.507]  And then he says, stop lying about me.
[02:57:00.507 --> 02:57:01.427]  You're the enemy of the people.
[02:57:01.427 --> 02:57:04.869]  When you lie, then they lie again and say that he's against the First Amendment.
[02:57:04.869 --> 02:57:06.750]  These people are incredible how much they lie.
[02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:07.430]  It's just crazy.
[02:57:08.791 --> 02:57:13.793]  It's all they got and some people out there are still believing what they're selling.
[02:57:13.793 --> 02:57:18.856]  They're still believing all that poop they're selling to them out there.
[02:57:18.856 --> 02:57:22.738]  But as you said and I said earlier, this is a win.
[02:57:23.436 --> 02:57:31.723]  With them, what they did to me by suspending me, fine, suspend me from Twitter, take me off Twitter, I'll live, see you tomorrow, I'll go fishing, no big deal.
[02:57:31.723 --> 02:57:36.247]  But what it did is it showed people of America that Twitter is hypocritical.
[02:57:36.247 --> 02:57:43.013]  Even though Jack goes on front of Congress and says, no, we're not left-leaning, we're not partisan, we're completely fair.
[02:57:45.168 --> 02:57:55.757]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:57:55.757 --> 02:57:57.819]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:57:57.819 --> 02:58:00.681]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:58:00.681 --> 02:58:01.882]  It's made in the USA.
[02:58:02.483 --> 02:58:02.743]  I think?
[02:58:25.865 --> 02:58:37.600]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:40.904]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:58:40.904 --> 02:58:44.048]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:46.257 --> 02:58:48.618]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:58:48.618 --> 02:58:55.181]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:58:55.181 --> 02:59:02.584]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to support your child's development.

[02:59:20.806 --> 02:59:24.649]  Which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[02:59:24.649 --> 02:59:34.475]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[02:59:34.475 --> 02:59:38.818]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.

[02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:58.355]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.355 --> 03:00:00.616]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.616 --> 03:00:03.997]  Just a good old boy.
[03:00:03.997 --> 03:00:05.298]  Never meaning no harm.
[03:00:07.785 --> 03:00:09.865]  Hey folks, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.865 --> 03:00:13.406]  I am guest hosting for Mr. Jones.
[03:00:13.406 --> 03:00:14.806]  My name is Gavin McInnes.
[03:00:14.806 --> 03:00:18.767]  I host a show on CRTV.com called Get Off My Lawn.
[03:00:18.767 --> 03:00:24.248]  I also host a show there called CRTV Tonight that goes up every fortnight.
[03:00:24.248 --> 03:00:27.349]  I don't mean the video game, I mean the two-week time span.
[03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:29.749]  That's a talk show, CRTV Tonight is.
[03:00:29.749 --> 03:00:34.130]  But the Get Off My Lawn is every night around 8.30.
[03:00:35.439 --> 03:00:42.443]  And it's 40 minutes of me doing basically what Alex Jones does.
[03:00:42.443 --> 03:00:43.844]  I'm trying to join a country club.
[03:00:43.844 --> 03:00:47.846]  I moved out to the suburbs and it's in Greenwich, Connecticut.
[03:00:47.846 --> 03:00:49.347]  And I played golf with the president.
[03:00:49.347 --> 03:00:50.427]  I was like, you know what?
[03:00:50.427 --> 03:00:51.668]  I want my kids to socialize.
[03:00:51.668 --> 03:00:57.511]  And it seems like these country clubs, I just moved from the city after 25 years, are the only place your kids can fraternize.
[03:00:57.511 --> 03:01:00.673]  I could drink anywhere under a bridge with a bum.
[03:01:00.673 --> 03:01:02.454]  But if it's good for the kids, we'll join the club.
[03:01:03.112 --> 03:01:13.399]  And I just heard, through the grapevine, that someone had found out I wanted to join the club and they go, so you got Alex Jones coming over to your club now?
[03:01:13.399 --> 03:01:15.500]  I'm Alex Jones, you see.
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:18.362]  And that's used as a metaphor to mean crazy people.
[03:01:18.362 --> 03:01:22.705]  Take that stupid hat off your head, you imbecile.
[03:01:22.705 --> 03:01:25.687]  Jesus, what is with these millennials?
[03:01:25.687 --> 03:01:26.848]  Goddamn, that's annoying!
[03:01:27.529 --> 03:01:28.411]  Why would you do that?
[03:01:28.411 --> 03:01:31.816]  That's the worst thing about millennials, is wearing a wool hat.
[03:01:31.816 --> 03:01:37.946]  It's in a hot studio here, it's about 85 degrees, and the first thing he does is go, I better put on a winter hat!
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:40.541]  Because it's so hot in here.
[03:01:40.541 --> 03:01:42.221]  Nice logic, millennials.
[03:01:42.221 --> 03:01:43.361]  You're so vain.
[03:01:43.361 --> 03:01:53.804]  And when I say you, I mean your entire generation is so vain that you want to cook yourself just to give your hair sort of that oomphy, slightly straighter bedhead.
[03:01:53.804 --> 03:02:00.106]  It's almost kind of anti-Semitic, by the way, because you hate curly hair and you want your hair to be straight and Anglo-Saxon.
[03:02:00.106 --> 03:02:03.327]  I want to look professional because it looks... Oh, it looks so professional.
[03:02:03.327 --> 03:02:05.087]  Put on a Make America Great Again hat.
[03:02:05.087 --> 03:02:05.928]  That's professional.
[03:02:08.868 --> 03:02:12.715]  They got their ass hanging out of their pants, they wear these damn shower shoes.
[03:02:12.715 --> 03:02:15.780]  I've seen kids swim in shower shoes.
[03:02:15.780 --> 03:02:17.643]  What the hell is going on there?
[03:02:17.643 --> 03:02:19.727]  Ankle socks and shower shoes.
[03:02:19.727 --> 03:02:21.270]  Are you a rich person in jail?
[03:02:21.997 --> 03:02:24.940]  They play basketball in these stupid shoes.
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:26.902]  It's infuriating!
[03:02:26.902 --> 03:02:28.924]  And they wear a sort of Gucci and Prada.
[03:02:28.924 --> 03:02:30.325]  They want all the hottest brands.
[03:02:30.325 --> 03:02:36.071]  They basically live like, uh, Rob Kardashian's ex-stripper wife there.
[03:02:36.071 --> 03:02:36.912]  Whatever her name is.
[03:02:36.912 --> 03:02:38.033]  Blac Chyna.
[03:02:38.033 --> 03:02:40.716]  Your whole generation is Blac Chyna.
[03:02:40.716 --> 03:02:43.759]  I hope you're proud of yourself.
[03:02:43.759 --> 03:02:45.400]  Anyway, sorry we got off track there.
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:45.761]  But, um...
[03:02:46.693 --> 03:02:56.311]  I just, I know that's a silly little anecdotal story about my life and I sound like a douche talking about the country club, but the fact that that guy said, so you got Alex Jones joining your club now?
[03:02:57.873 --> 03:02:59.354]  And I, the president told me this.
[03:02:59.354 --> 03:03:04.177]  And I found out later that, uh, the guy who said that doesn't even go to that particular club.
[03:03:04.177 --> 03:03:05.678]  I'm, I'm a city guy.
[03:03:05.678 --> 03:03:07.099]  I've moved out in 1988.
[03:03:07.099 --> 03:03:09.400]  I haven't lived in the Burbs since 1988.
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:12.802]  So I'm new to all this, but apparently there's rivalries with clubs.
[03:03:12.802 --> 03:03:14.103]  Like this one is more WASP-y.
[03:03:14.103 --> 03:03:15.544]  This one is more Jewish.
[03:03:15.544 --> 03:03:18.626]  This one is more Italian, Catholic, Protestant.
[03:03:18.626 --> 03:03:20.567]  They all have their little silly rivalries.
[03:03:20.567 --> 03:03:22.808]  It's embarrassing, really.
[03:03:22.808 --> 03:03:27.491]  Um, and this guy was trying to sabotage my application because I'm an InfoWars guy.
[03:03:28.491 --> 03:03:31.813]  And to that I say, A, what's the matter with Alex Jones?
[03:03:31.813 --> 03:03:35.915]  I know it's weird to be on the Alex Jones Show talking about Alex Jones, but it came up.
[03:03:35.915 --> 03:03:40.578]  And B, why are you trying to sabotage someone else's social life?
[03:03:40.578 --> 03:03:45.400]  There is this intense pariah status going around with anyone who might be right-wing now.
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:47.462]  I was just booted off Twitter.
[03:03:47.462 --> 03:03:51.384]  And it is, it's like McCarthyism, although McCarthyism was justified.
[03:03:51.384 --> 03:03:55.346]  It's more like the Salem witch hunts, where the witches they're looking for aren't witches.
[03:03:56.531 --> 03:04:06.626]  And the amount of hubris and intervention that these people are utilizing to sabotage someone else's life, and not just someone else's life, my kids!
[03:04:07.367 --> 03:04:09.068]  It's their social life that'll be affected.
[03:04:09.068 --> 03:04:11.209]  Us old guys don't care about social lives.
[03:04:11.209 --> 03:04:12.910]  We know who our best friend is.
[03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:14.811]  Whoever's sitting there at the bar.
[03:04:14.811 --> 03:04:16.752]  Hey, how about the Mets last night?
[03:04:16.752 --> 03:04:17.573]  I hate the Mets.
[03:04:17.573 --> 03:04:17.913]  Oh, okay.
[03:04:17.913 --> 03:04:18.814]  Well, I like the Mets.
[03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:20.054]  We're still friends, by the way.
[03:04:20.054 --> 03:04:21.975]  I'll still talk to that guy for 10 minutes.
[03:04:21.975 --> 03:04:22.656]  He's a Yankees guy.
[03:04:22.656 --> 03:04:23.436]  I'm a Mets guy.
[03:04:23.436 --> 03:04:24.697]  He can crap on the Mets the whole time.
[03:04:24.697 --> 03:04:26.538]  I just had my friendship for the week.
[03:04:26.538 --> 03:04:27.338]  I'm good.
[03:04:27.338 --> 03:04:28.159]  Full up to the brim.
[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:32.083]  But little kids, they need friends.
[03:04:32.083 --> 03:04:35.105]  And I'm becoming a pariah in the burbs.
[03:04:35.105 --> 03:04:38.889]  And it just, it disturbs me that anyone cares.
[03:04:38.889 --> 03:04:49.600]  Why does the left care so much about right-wingers' personal lives, about their friendships and their romances and their country clubs?
[03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:50.741]  It's insane.
[03:04:50.741 --> 03:04:53.023]  When we come back, we'll be discussing this much more.
[03:04:54.124 --> 03:04:55.464]  We knew it was coming.
[03:04:55.464 --> 03:04:56.905]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:04:56.905 --> 03:05:10.889]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then voila!
[03:05:11.169 --> 03:05:21.212]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:05:21.212 --> 03:05:24.212]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:05:24.212 --> 03:05:26.073]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[03:05:26.073 --> 03:05:27.133]  Just click on the link.
[03:05:27.133 --> 03:05:30.094]  Whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:05:30.774 --> 03:05:40.223]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.
[03:05:40.223 --> 03:05:52.354]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show how they can download the free Android and iPhone apps, how they can then reach out to others with the information and point out this is the verboten info.
[03:05:52.354 --> 03:05:53.715]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:05:53.715 --> 03:05:56.878]  You've got to keep them separated.
[03:06:09.933 --> 03:06:22.106]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:06:22.106 --> 03:06:24.869]  By the way, there's going to be a lot of errors over the next hour.
[03:06:24.869 --> 03:06:25.529]  I'm new.
[03:06:25.529 --> 03:06:26.070]  I'm trying.
[03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:31.495]  Remember those horribly sadistic pins that they make people in the service industry wear?
[03:06:31.495 --> 03:06:32.877]  I'm new, but I'm trying.
[03:06:34.133 --> 03:06:40.080]  I just want to bitch about the suburbs a little bit more because we live out here and we pay very little money.
[03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:48.168]  I'm not in the burbs now, I'm in the city at my studio, but I live out in the burbs, pay tons of money in taxes and it's mostly to get away from urban life.
[03:06:48.168 --> 03:06:50.251]  And Obama on the left sees that as racist.
[03:06:50.251 --> 03:06:52.313]  Oh, you want to get away from black people?
[03:06:52.313 --> 03:06:54.095]  There's a lot of black people in Connecticut.
[03:06:54.838 --> 03:06:56.820]  And they want to get away from the hood, too.
[03:06:56.820 --> 03:06:58.301]  They want the better education.
[03:06:58.301 --> 03:07:06.810]  So when Obama enforces these diversity quotas and subsidized housing, middle class black people are going, what are you doing?
[03:07:06.810 --> 03:07:08.932]  I busted my ass to get out of there.
[03:07:08.932 --> 03:07:11.594]  I started my own construction company to get out of there.
[03:07:11.594 --> 03:07:13.476]  And now you're making these schools worse?
[03:07:13.476 --> 03:07:16.139]  But I find that the less diverse
[03:07:17.394 --> 03:07:34.101]  A neighborhood is the more they cherish the diversity and in Connecticut they have like the local bar lets the old black guy drink for free and everyone is so trepidatious about anyone who might be conservative because that might be racist and you think Racism isn't a thing.
[03:07:34.101 --> 03:07:35.802]  So why are you so obsessed with it?
[03:07:35.802 --> 03:07:44.826]  There's so many other pariahs out there like think of that guy from Seinfeld careers over because he swore he said the n-word a bunch of times and that is a bad word.
[03:07:44.826 --> 03:07:45.486]  Don't get me wrong.
[03:07:46.648 --> 03:07:50.691]  It's up there with the C word as one of the top bad words there is.
[03:07:50.691 --> 03:07:52.833]  But your career's over because you swore?
[03:07:52.833 --> 03:07:54.455]  I don't understand it.
[03:07:54.455 --> 03:08:00.159]  How about we recalibrate the pariah machine?
[03:08:00.159 --> 03:08:02.041]  It's aimed at the wrong person.
[03:08:02.041 --> 03:08:05.303]  How about we found out some guy works at Purdue Pharmaceuticals?
[03:08:06.567 --> 03:08:08.128]  We all know the Slacker family, right?
[03:08:08.128 --> 03:08:08.689]  Richard?
[03:08:08.689 --> 03:08:09.790]  No, Sackler.
[03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:12.732]  Richard Sackler is the patriarch of the Sackler family.
[03:08:12.732 --> 03:08:21.539]  And basically this entire opioid epidemic can be traced back to this one man and his incredibly rich billionaire family.
[03:08:21.539 --> 03:08:23.861]  Purdue Pharmaceuticals makes Oxycontin.
[03:08:23.861 --> 03:08:29.546]  And they had all kinds of incentives there for doctors to push it on their patients.
[03:08:29.546 --> 03:08:30.767]  Oh, you stubbed your toe?
[03:08:30.767 --> 03:08:31.648]  Here's some heroin!
[03:08:31.648 --> 03:08:34.570]  Uh, I feel a lot better, dude.
[03:08:36.714 --> 03:08:41.235]  And we've all seen the cashiers nodding out as they're giving out change.
[03:08:41.235 --> 03:08:43.636]  They're not punk rockers from the 70s.
[03:08:43.636 --> 03:08:45.657]  This isn't a Sid Vicious problem anymore.
[03:08:45.657 --> 03:08:47.678]  This isn't Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers.
[03:08:47.678 --> 03:08:50.679]  This isn't Lou Reed taking a walk on the wild side.
[03:08:50.679 --> 03:08:52.860]  This is your dad.
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:55.801]  And, more importantly, this is your son.
[03:08:56.528 --> 03:09:02.572]  Your son is going to die because of this opioid epidemic, and it is pure corruption.
[03:09:02.572 --> 03:09:19.444]  Big Pharma is incentivizing this, and naive, corrupt, incompetent, evil doctors, and this is not true of all doctors, but there seems to be a lot of them, a hell of a lot of them that are willing to, that are hypocritical, but the Hippocratic Oath has become the hypocritical oath now.
[03:09:20.519 --> 03:09:22.380]  And they're pushing this on these people.
[03:09:22.380 --> 03:09:23.600]  These normal Americans.
[03:09:23.600 --> 03:09:24.781]  These Ohio farmers.
[03:09:24.781 --> 03:09:27.402]  These little rich kids.
[03:09:27.402 --> 03:09:30.043]  Rich kids and poor kids are all dying in equal numbers now.
[03:09:30.043 --> 03:09:33.144]  It's the one great unifier we have in this country now.
[03:09:33.144 --> 03:09:37.166]  It's the Sackler's War on Americans.
[03:09:37.166 --> 03:09:38.546]  And so the guy does Oxy, right?
[03:09:38.546 --> 03:09:39.047]  You know the story.
[03:09:39.047 --> 03:09:39.747]  He has a sore back.
[03:09:39.747 --> 03:09:41.388]  He gets addicted to the painkillers.
[03:09:41.388 --> 03:09:45.369]  And then they become too expensive to buy illegally after his prescription runs out.
[03:09:45.369 --> 03:09:48.190]  So he hears of this thing called heroin.
[03:09:50.106 --> 03:09:51.269]  You mean a female hero?
[03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:53.014]  Yeah, it's the same word.
[03:09:53.014 --> 03:09:54.217]  It's spelled different.
[03:09:54.217 --> 03:09:54.959]  Oh, how much is it?
[03:09:54.959 --> 03:09:56.463]  It's about a hundred bucks for a bundle.
[03:09:56.463 --> 03:09:58.107]  A bundle lasts you a month.
[03:09:58.107 --> 03:09:58.549]  Yes, please.
[03:09:59.286 --> 03:10:02.867]  So now we have suburban junkies, rural junkies.
[03:10:02.867 --> 03:10:04.247]  And who supplies them the heroin?
[03:10:04.247 --> 03:10:07.348]  Well, there's another convenient thing the globalists have set up for us.
[03:10:07.348 --> 03:10:08.609]  Open borders!
[03:10:08.609 --> 03:10:12.890]  So now we have heroin pouring over the border and MS-13 happy to dole it out.
[03:10:12.890 --> 03:10:19.852]  Over in Long Island, just up the road from me, it's a slightly less affluent suburb, they have murders all the time.
[03:10:19.852 --> 03:10:20.832]  Gang murders.
[03:10:21.508 --> 03:10:25.671]  Because MS-13 is vying for different territories.
[03:10:25.671 --> 03:10:26.352]  You know what's crazy?
[03:10:26.352 --> 03:10:27.573]  I just remembered this right now.
[03:10:27.573 --> 03:10:32.636]  Remember that black woman who was there for Trump's inauguration?
[03:10:32.636 --> 03:10:37.620]  And he brought her up and he said, this woman just had her daughter murdered by MS-13.
[03:10:37.620 --> 03:10:39.582]  And everyone cried and we saw the couple.
[03:10:39.582 --> 03:10:42.123]  I just read the other day that she was killed.
[03:10:42.123 --> 03:10:44.365]  You know how she was killed?
[03:10:44.365 --> 03:10:50.750]  The woman who, they had a shrine to this poor woman's daughter, and the woman who owns the property there,
[03:10:51.474 --> 03:10:53.656]  Decided that that was hurting her sales.
[03:10:53.656 --> 03:10:57.618]  She couldn't sell her home because too many people were bawling their eyes out at her doorstep.
[03:10:57.618 --> 03:11:00.761]  So she picked it all up and threw it in her SUV.
[03:11:00.761 --> 03:11:05.344]  And then the mother of the victim goes, Hey, can you not pick up all these candles and pictures of my daughter?
[03:11:05.344 --> 03:11:08.486]  So the woman ran her over and killed her.
[03:11:08.486 --> 03:11:10.828]  This is the America we're living in now.
[03:11:10.828 --> 03:11:19.154]  Mourning mothers being run over by another angry... I don't know what her background was, but I'm assuming it's bad.
[03:11:19.154 --> 03:11:20.355]  So anyway, I bring up all of this.
[03:11:21.041 --> 03:11:31.304]  To say, how about you find out someone at Purdue Pharmaceuticals lives down the street, and how about there's some whispering about him?
[03:11:31.304 --> 03:11:34.365]  I see it in my neighborhood, I see whispers all the time.
[03:11:34.365 --> 03:11:38.946]  Sometimes I'll be walking down the street and I'll see a housewife just go, like she's finally seen
[03:11:39.827 --> 03:11:42.729]  Hannibal Lecter walk by just, oh my God.
[03:11:42.729 --> 03:11:44.270]  And what is the horror?
[03:11:44.270 --> 03:11:46.412]  The horror is that I like Trump.
[03:11:46.412 --> 03:11:48.293]  And if I like Trump, I might be conservative.
[03:11:48.293 --> 03:11:54.217]  And I'm being linked to Charlottesville, which I disavowed like a maniac.
[03:11:54.217 --> 03:11:57.139]  But the owner, the guy who ran it, had been stalking me.
[03:11:57.139 --> 03:11:58.600]  So we must be friends.
[03:11:58.600 --> 03:11:59.921]  And I must have organized it.
[03:11:59.921 --> 03:12:02.503]  Just the fact that I disavowed it would be damned.
[03:12:02.503 --> 03:12:06.826]  And it got me thinking, I'm sorry to talk about myself so much, but you'll be in the same boat one day.
[03:12:06.826 --> 03:12:07.586]  First, they came for me.
[03:12:07.586 --> 03:12:08.407]  They're going for you next.
[03:12:09.309 --> 03:12:11.310]  I blame Soros for all of this.
[03:12:11.310 --> 03:12:16.732]  Soros is terrorizing me and trying to shut down my fraternal club, the Proud Boys.
[03:12:16.732 --> 03:12:21.314]  And he's paying people to mess with my life and spread these lies about me, spread fake news.
[03:12:21.314 --> 03:12:22.755]  Now that sounds paranoid.
[03:12:22.755 --> 03:12:25.556]  And you go, Gavin, that's mental patient o'clock.
[03:12:25.556 --> 03:12:27.657]  What are you talking about?
[03:12:27.657 --> 03:12:30.498]  He's sitting there with his little checkbook going out and paying people?
[03:12:30.498 --> 03:12:31.938]  No, it's not that covert.
[03:12:31.938 --> 03:12:37.661]  In fact, I think these murders linked to Hillary are not as simple as her saying, go and kill
[03:12:38.557 --> 03:12:40.738]  Uh, what's his name, Rich?
[03:12:40.738 --> 03:12:41.418]  What's his name again?
[03:12:41.418 --> 03:12:41.939]  I forgot.
[03:12:41.939 --> 03:12:42.619]  Seth Rich.
[03:12:42.619 --> 03:12:43.919]  Go and kill Seth Rich.
[03:12:43.919 --> 03:12:44.320]  No, no, no.
[03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:47.181]  She might not have even known about the murder of Seth Rich.
[03:12:47.181 --> 03:12:57.805]  I think there's a sort of a machine that started in 92 with the Clintons getting rid of people who got in the way and it sort of spiraled out of control and she's just like, oh, they killed Seth Rich.
[03:12:57.805 --> 03:12:58.405]  Oh, great.
[03:12:58.405 --> 03:12:59.346]  Oh, great.
[03:12:59.346 --> 03:12:59.826]  Here we go.
[03:12:59.826 --> 03:13:02.047]  I just wanted Vince Foster's stuff messed with.
[03:13:02.634 --> 03:13:04.335]  This is totally out of control, you guys!
[03:13:04.335 --> 03:13:08.896]  And they're like, this is Clinton, you're putting us in a very difficult situation.
[03:13:08.896 --> 03:13:11.037]  Maybe you should just keep your mouth shut.
[03:13:11.037 --> 03:13:13.478]  And I don't think George Soros is going, oh, we killed someone else.
[03:13:13.478 --> 03:13:15.258]  I think this is what happened with Soros.
[03:13:15.258 --> 03:13:16.739]  He's a billionaire, right?
[03:13:16.739 --> 03:13:19.860]  And he hates the fact that he spilled the beans in his own books.
[03:13:20.467 --> 03:13:21.608]  About working with the Nazis.
[03:13:21.608 --> 03:13:30.354]  And in his own books, he basically said, I was a paper boy who would go door to door and say, this house has Jews, this house has Jews, hey Jews, you should leave or you're going to get killed.
[03:13:30.354 --> 03:13:31.875]  Hey Jews, get out of here.
[03:13:31.875 --> 03:13:32.476]  That was his thing.
[03:13:32.476 --> 03:13:33.817]  He'd put the notice on your door.
[03:13:33.817 --> 03:13:37.940]  But instead of saying, we're having a sale at pennies, it said, we're going to kill you.
[03:13:37.940 --> 03:13:42.783]  And when he talked about it on 60 Minutes, he said, it was the greatest time of my life.
[03:13:42.783 --> 03:13:43.243]  I don't regret it.
[03:13:43.243 --> 03:13:44.344]  It was fun.
[03:13:44.344 --> 03:13:46.546]  And then he went, that was probably not great PR.
[03:13:48.175 --> 03:13:54.598]  So now he's changed it to, I was hiding, I was alone, and my father... His father, by the way, was a total globalist.
[03:13:54.598 --> 03:13:55.438]  Atheist.
[03:13:55.438 --> 03:13:58.260]  Didn't just hate religious people, but he was an anti-Semite.
[03:13:58.260 --> 03:13:59.720]  He was a Jewish anti-Semite.
[03:13:59.720 --> 03:14:01.901]  And he was not a fan of any religious people at all.
[03:14:01.901 --> 03:14:07.804]  In fact, he wants Azal to be atheist, and he wants the whole globe... He wanted, he's dead.
[03:14:07.804 --> 03:14:10.986]  He wanted the whole globe to speak that Esperanto language.
[03:14:10.986 --> 03:14:12.346]  Tower of Babel stuff.
[03:14:12.346 --> 03:14:15.628]  Anyway, so he sits down with his PR people, and he goes,
[03:14:16.667 --> 03:14:18.188]  I gotta kill this Hitler thing!
[03:14:18.188 --> 03:14:21.629]  It's looking real- I don't know if you know this, but Nazis have a bad rep!
[03:14:21.629 --> 03:14:22.790]  What should I do?
[03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:24.671]  And his people said, alright, here's what we do.
[03:14:24.671 --> 03:14:38.297]  We change the story to you're a Holocaust survivor, and you had to go to these places, or they would have killed you, and you were in disguise, and you were a little kid, you had no idea what you were doing, you were only 14, and you were crying the whole time, and you were just sort of like a deer in the headlights the whole time.
[03:14:38.297 --> 03:14:39.578]  And he goes, love it.
[03:14:39.578 --> 03:14:40.218]  Okay?
[03:14:40.218 --> 03:14:41.239]  What about the truth, though?
[03:14:41.719 --> 03:14:53.082]  And they go, oh, we'll just use lawfare and fake news and we'll terrorize anyone who brings up the truth of what really happened and hurts this whole Holocaust survivor narrative that we have going for you.
[03:14:53.082 --> 03:14:56.623]  And he goes, thanks, sounds good, sign off on it, bye.
[03:14:56.623 --> 03:14:58.283]  That, I think, is the end for Soros.
[03:14:58.283 --> 03:15:01.464]  And now the bots, the staff, they're out there.
[03:15:01.464 --> 03:15:06.225]  Like, Ezra Levant wrote an article about George Soros where he brought all this up.
[03:15:07.140 --> 03:15:22.850]  And, curiously enough, shortly after that, Ezra Levin has been battling ridiculous lawsuit after ridiculous lawsuit from people who would normally have no money, like teachers, suing him because he said this that is tangentially related to their profession.
[03:15:22.850 --> 03:15:24.251]  And I'm looking at these court cases and I go,
[03:15:25.507 --> 03:15:26.687]  This is lawfare!
[03:15:26.687 --> 03:15:27.808]  Someone is behind this!
[03:15:27.808 --> 03:15:33.669]  And I honestly believe it was the thing that started a long time ago with that article, which has since been taken down, by the way.
[03:15:33.669 --> 03:15:35.270]  That 600-word article.
[03:15:35.270 --> 03:15:37.270]  And I think I'm going through the same thing.
[03:15:37.270 --> 03:15:44.872]  I think I'm part of this sort of computer virus that the source machine sort of sends out in the system to mess with your life.
[03:15:44.872 --> 03:15:46.193]  And mess with the kids' lives, of course.
[03:15:46.193 --> 03:15:50.334]  Alright, we're gonna be back after this with more me bitching about my life.
[03:15:53.146 --> 03:15:56.607]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.

[03:18:54.265 --> 03:19:03.507]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[03:19:03.507 --> 03:19:10.208]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[03:19:10.208 --> 03:19:17.930]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie and there's this purple gas.
[03:19:17.930 --> 03:19:21.210]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[03:19:21.210 --> 03:19:23.171]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[03:19:24.231 --> 03:19:29.294]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[03:19:29.294 --> 03:19:30.995]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[03:19:30.995 --> 03:19:32.216]  I'm breaking the contract.
[03:19:32.216 --> 03:19:34.137]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[03:19:34.137 --> 03:19:36.479]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[03:19:36.479 --> 03:19:40.221]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[03:19:40.221 --> 03:19:41.662]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[03:19:41.662 --> 03:19:43.363]  It'll be gone in a couple months.

[03:19:57.243 --> 03:20:10.208]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.208 --> 03:20:14.549]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[03:20:14.549 --> 03:20:16.430]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:18.887 --> 03:20:23.109]  And we're back!
[03:20:23.109 --> 03:20:28.751]  Back to Gavin McInnes, filling in for Alex Jones and treating you like my psychiatrist.
[03:20:28.751 --> 03:20:34.572]  I'm lying on the couch here, bitching about the sort of pariah status that has been imbued upon me.
[03:20:34.572 --> 03:20:39.714]  And the reason it's relevant to your life is I believe that this can be traced back to Soros.
[03:20:39.714 --> 03:20:43.655]  I'm obviously not saying that he sits there writing a check saying, care eyes Gavin.
[03:20:43.655 --> 03:20:45.216]  I wouldn't be surprised if he has no idea who I am.
[03:20:45.896 --> 03:20:52.798]  But I think in the cases of Hillary Clinton and George Soros, all these horrible things that happened, was started by a domino they pushed long ago.
[03:20:52.798 --> 03:21:00.800]  I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary Clinton's people murdered Seth Rich and she didn't know that it happened.
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:07.841]  I believe that she was complicit in murders in the early 90s with all of Clinton's various mistresses.
[03:21:07.841 --> 03:21:10.962]  There's so many murders of a woman like that.
[03:21:10.962 --> 03:21:15.363]  His translator, his death sign woman, he was definitely sleeping with.
[03:21:15.928 --> 03:21:16.989]  I shouldn't say definitely.
[03:21:16.989 --> 03:21:20.712]  I'm convinced he was sleeping with, and she was robbed when she worked at Starbucks after she quit.
[03:21:20.712 --> 03:21:22.694]  They shot her in the head and didn't take any money.
[03:21:22.694 --> 03:21:27.217]  Or her chef who drowned face down in a creek while camping.
[03:21:27.217 --> 03:21:29.159]  I mean, go look it up!
[03:21:29.159 --> 03:21:33.743]  And I was kind of cynical too about her, the things she did, but there's about 40.
[03:21:33.743 --> 03:21:38.646]  And I always say to liberals, I go, okay, I get that sounds crazy, right?
[03:21:38.646 --> 03:21:40.448]  Where's Obama's list?
[03:21:40.448 --> 03:21:42.630]  You know where Obama's chef is?
[03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:44.571]  He's making a BLT right now.
[03:21:44.571 --> 03:21:45.292]  He's alive.
[03:21:45.908 --> 03:21:49.711]  You know where this woman who was seen with Obama late at night is?
[03:21:49.711 --> 03:21:53.353]  She's picking her nose right now at the gym, waiting to use the treadmill.
[03:21:53.353 --> 03:21:54.434]  She's alive!
[03:21:54.434 --> 03:21:59.418]  All these people around the Obamas, you gotta use the Obamas too, because they can't handle any other kind of metaphor.
[03:21:59.418 --> 03:22:00.719]  They're all fine.
[03:22:00.719 --> 03:22:02.280]  George W. Bush's chef is fine.
[03:22:02.280 --> 03:22:07.804]  It's just this one person that has this long list of curious deaths.
[03:22:10.393 --> 03:22:12.494]  And so that, I think it's the same with Soros.
[03:22:12.494 --> 03:22:16.897]  I think he had a meeting a long time ago and said, terrorize anyone who brings up that Nazi thing, make their lives hell.
[03:22:16.897 --> 03:22:19.739]  Make sure they can't work at a country club.
[03:22:19.739 --> 03:22:23.801]  Make sure that they're known as Alex Jones and make sure Alex Jones has stigma too.
[03:22:23.801 --> 03:22:25.342]  He talks about me all the time.
[03:22:25.342 --> 03:22:27.704]  I want his children to have trouble in school.
[03:22:27.704 --> 03:22:33.587]  I want his daughter's tutor, like my daughter's tutor recently quit because of my politics.
[03:22:33.587 --> 03:22:34.968]  And the thing I was saying earlier is,
[03:22:35.755 --> 03:22:39.038]  I wish it could be for something that I actually believe.
[03:22:39.038 --> 03:22:40.959]  Or, I wish I could be an actual bad guy.
[03:22:40.959 --> 03:22:45.583]  Like, if you work at Purdue Pharmaceuticals, you should be a pariah.
[03:22:45.583 --> 03:22:51.608]  Your children, I don't know, I shouldn't say your children should suffer, that's insane, but if anyone's going to be a pariah, it should be someone involved in big pharma.
[03:22:51.608 --> 03:22:56.071]  Someone whose job actually does lead to death.
[03:22:56.071 --> 03:23:03.477]  And these bad guys that they have, these so-called racists and Nazis, whatever, like Richard Spencer, he's not me, okay, obviously.
[03:23:03.477 --> 03:23:04.018]  But even him.
[03:23:04.659 --> 03:23:08.162]  His beliefs don't lead to deaths.
[03:23:08.162 --> 03:23:11.184]  I mean, can't you be mad at actual bad guys?
[03:23:11.184 --> 03:23:12.745]  Can't you tear eyes actual bad guys?
[03:23:12.745 --> 03:23:14.507]  So sorry, I've got too many threads running at once here.
[03:23:14.507 --> 03:23:24.815]  But the Soros thing, I think, so he, his little bots, and I picture them as kind of females, I picture them as lesbians, they're in law.
[03:23:24.815 --> 03:23:28.397]  And I think they're the ones who dole out like the money for this BLM stuff and all that.
[03:23:28.397 --> 03:23:30.399]  And he's just like, go ahead, handle it.
[03:23:30.399 --> 03:23:31.279]  I don't want to hear about it.
[03:23:31.279 --> 03:23:32.440]  I'm busy in my jacuzzi.
[03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:37.382]  I think Charlottesville has been pinned to me quite a bit.
[03:23:37.382 --> 03:23:39.703]  And I was very adamant from the beginning, I don't want anything to do with this.
[03:23:39.703 --> 03:23:42.826]  Now, Jason Kessler, he's the guy who organized it.
[03:23:42.826 --> 03:23:45.367]  Jason Kessler kept trying to join my group, the Proud Boys.
[03:23:45.367 --> 03:23:47.129]  He went to two different things.
[03:23:47.129 --> 03:23:48.830]  Showed up, he seemed nice, hey, blah, blah, blah.
[03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:53.774]  We did our little ritual, and then, I mean, both times we started to smell a rat, kicked him out.
[03:23:53.774 --> 03:23:58.297]  He called me regularly, he was very friendly, and said, I'm just a guy who likes statues.
[03:23:58.297 --> 03:23:59.698]  And me too.
[03:23:59.698 --> 03:24:01.479]  I also think statues shouldn't be torn down.
[03:24:01.479 --> 03:24:02.720]  So we bonded on that.
[03:24:02.720 --> 03:24:03.521]  I said, are you alt-right?
[03:24:03.521 --> 03:24:03.941]  He said, no.
[03:24:04.898 --> 03:24:05.338]  Absolutely not.
[03:24:05.338 --> 03:24:06.199]  Lied about it.
[03:24:06.199 --> 03:24:07.840]  Right?
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:12.142]  And the Charlottesville thing was pushed as a let's stop taking statues down thing.
[03:24:12.142 --> 03:24:13.943]  And the statues thing is getting ridiculous.
[03:24:13.943 --> 03:24:17.905]  In my home country of Canada, they just took down a Sir John A. Macdonald statue.
[03:24:17.905 --> 03:24:18.865]  What?
[03:24:18.865 --> 03:24:21.087]  Because of the way he treated the Indians.
[03:24:21.087 --> 03:24:22.107]  We tried hugging them.
[03:24:22.107 --> 03:24:23.468]  They killed us.
[03:24:23.468 --> 03:24:27.130]  You got to play rough, I'm afraid, if you want to stay alive 300 years ago.
[03:24:27.130 --> 03:24:27.310]  Anyway.
[03:24:30.849 --> 03:24:32.291]  Uh, I spelled it right anyway.
[03:24:32.291 --> 03:24:33.452]  And I said, you know what, Jason?
[03:24:33.452 --> 03:24:34.774]  I don't trust you.
[03:24:34.774 --> 03:24:35.555]  You're out of the Proud Boys.
[03:24:35.555 --> 03:24:36.736]  You've got nothing to do with us.
[03:24:36.736 --> 03:24:38.678]  And this is like two months before.
[03:24:38.678 --> 03:24:39.679]  I said, we're not going.
[03:24:39.679 --> 03:24:40.941]  Anyone who goes is evil.
[03:24:40.941 --> 03:24:42.723]  I disavow, disavow, disavow.
[03:24:42.723 --> 03:24:43.484]  And then he called me.
[03:24:43.484 --> 03:24:44.625]  I remember it was on the beach.
[03:24:44.625 --> 03:24:45.286]  It was during the summer.
[03:24:45.991 --> 03:24:49.692]  And he was panicking, saying, you gotta come, we'll pay for your flight.
[03:24:49.692 --> 03:24:53.153]  Look, this is just about statues, we need to unite, blah blah blah blah blah.
[03:24:53.153 --> 03:24:56.354]  And portrayed it as a wonderful thing, and I said to him, I remember this vividly.
[03:24:56.354 --> 03:24:58.294]  I got mad, because he was so adamant about it.
[03:24:58.294 --> 03:24:59.715]  You know, he just wouldn't take no for an answer.
[03:24:59.715 --> 03:25:02.496]  I said, look dude, I fought Nazis in the 80s.
[03:25:02.496 --> 03:25:04.556]  We had our Rock Against Racism concerts.
[03:25:04.556 --> 03:25:10.178]  I had my events, where I was out there busting my ass and on the phone making sure this guy's gonna come, that guy's gonna come.
[03:25:10.178 --> 03:25:10.818]  I've done all that.
[03:25:11.494 --> 03:25:13.475]  Now I'm with my family in the summer.
[03:25:13.475 --> 03:25:14.636]  I don't want to hear about your event.
[03:25:14.636 --> 03:25:15.737]  You go have your event.
[03:25:15.737 --> 03:25:17.618]  It's none of my beeswax.
[03:25:17.618 --> 03:25:19.439]  And he seemed panicked by that.
[03:25:19.439 --> 03:25:21.941]  Whereas anyone else is organizing a thing goes, Oh, you can't go.
[03:25:21.941 --> 03:25:22.541]  Okay.
[03:25:22.541 --> 03:25:26.163]  Next on the list of, of who can do it.
[03:25:26.163 --> 03:25:30.866]  And I'm convinced in retrospect that Charlottesville is a fake thing.
[03:25:30.866 --> 03:25:34.529]  It was set up by Soros lackeys to
[03:25:35.754 --> 03:25:48.803]  Discredit the right to get rid of people that were near the edge, like Milo, Yiannopoulos, and Lauren Southern, to get us in there and mix us with the Nazis, who hate us by the way, and then discredit us all and we'll be done.
[03:25:48.803 --> 03:25:54.127]  And I do believe a lot of those guys with tiki torches were real guys, when they were saying blood and so on, all that Nazi stuff.
[03:25:54.127 --> 03:25:55.668]  I believe they believed that.
[03:25:55.668 --> 03:25:57.109]  I think a lot of them are autistic weirdos.
[03:25:58.178 --> 03:25:59.939]  And I think it backfired.
[03:25:59.939 --> 03:26:11.281]  I think whoever was in charge, whatever globalist lefty group was in charge of setting up Charlottesville, and Jason Kessler, by the way, was an Occupy Wall Street Democrat.
[03:26:11.281 --> 03:26:14.402]  I think whoever set that up got fired.
[03:26:14.402 --> 03:26:15.182]  It didn't turn out.
[03:26:15.182 --> 03:26:17.003]  We only got one death.
[03:26:17.003 --> 03:26:17.923]  Shit.
[03:26:17.923 --> 03:26:18.843]  We didn't want that.
[03:26:18.843 --> 03:26:21.184]  We wanted total and utter chaos.
[03:26:21.184 --> 03:26:22.084]  Much more racism.
[03:26:22.084 --> 03:26:22.864]  It didn't go on.
[03:26:22.864 --> 03:26:25.745]  But they still cling to that one Heather Heyer death.
[03:26:26.482 --> 03:26:28.344]  Which, even that is starting to sound dubious.
[03:26:28.344 --> 03:26:29.465]  I obviously think she was killed.
[03:26:29.465 --> 03:26:30.245]  That's horrible.
[03:26:30.245 --> 03:26:31.186]  Horrific.
[03:26:31.186 --> 03:26:32.107]  Terrible.
[03:26:32.107 --> 03:26:34.329]  But some things that no one talks about with that death.
[03:26:34.329 --> 03:26:42.716]  One, why is a girl in flip-flops going to what she sees as, and what turned out to be, a gigantic Nazi rally?
[03:26:42.716 --> 03:26:45.058]  Like, I think MS-13 is a scourge.
[03:26:45.058 --> 03:26:47.681]  If they were having a gathering, I'm a pretty good fighter.
[03:26:47.681 --> 03:26:48.942]  I box three days a week.
[03:26:48.942 --> 03:26:51.164]  The idea that I would just march in and go, Hey!
[03:26:51.164 --> 03:26:52.345]  Not on my watch, MS-13!
[03:26:54.082 --> 03:26:56.103]  You're out of here, buster!
[03:26:56.103 --> 03:26:57.804]  I'm scared of MS-13.
[03:26:57.804 --> 03:26:59.245]  I'm scared of gangs.
[03:26:59.245 --> 03:27:06.890]  I don't go up to the Mongols, and I'm not going to say anything bad about them, even as a metaphor, because I'd hate that to be taken out of context, because they're dangerous dudes.
[03:27:06.890 --> 03:27:09.091]  So, why is your daughter going there?
[03:27:09.091 --> 03:27:19.638]  That's A. B, we've had this professor bragging about how he chased the guy who ran her over, whatever his name was, James Denlevy or something, I forget his name,
[03:27:20.434 --> 03:27:23.177]  Uh, terrorized him, scared him, with a shotgun.
[03:27:23.177 --> 03:27:24.539]  So he got in his car.
[03:27:24.539 --> 03:27:27.922]  And we've also seen footage of them bashing at his car, smashing windows.
[03:27:27.922 --> 03:27:30.445]  Freaking him out.
[03:27:30.445 --> 03:27:33.247]  So this whole thing was a complete mess.
[03:27:33.247 --> 03:27:37.952]  And I think it's something much more sinister than it's made out to be.
[03:27:37.952 --> 03:27:40.355]  And by the way, also, for the record,
[03:27:41.111 --> 03:27:43.373]  Uh, this was the worst they got, right?
[03:27:43.373 --> 03:27:51.058]  It took all this maniacal planning, and lies, and deception, and pretendings about statues, and they managed to scrounge up what?
[03:27:51.058 --> 03:27:53.099]  200 guys?
[03:27:53.099 --> 03:27:54.420]  What is the population of America?
[03:27:54.420 --> 03:27:57.302]  What do we have, like 360 million?
[03:27:57.302 --> 03:28:02.806]  You basically are showing us a threat that is not even close to as dangerous as elevators.
[03:28:03.807 --> 03:28:07.370]  Wait, we lose 6 Americans a year to spider bites.
[03:28:07.370 --> 03:28:20.361]  Your enemy, even in your worst case scenario, even if we ignore my theory that it was a fake rally, even all that, you're still in the elevator, measles, spiders kind of an area of danger.
[03:28:20.361 --> 03:28:22.022]  Whereas, Big Pharma, 40,000 a year!
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:27.261]  36,000 a year, to be specific.
[03:28:27.261 --> 03:28:37.124]  That's 115 people a day dying from opioids, from that one that killed Prince, and Noxy, and heroin, all of those combined.
[03:28:37.124 --> 03:28:37.724]  115 a day.
[03:28:37.724 --> 03:28:39.224]  Yet those guys aren't pariahs.
[03:28:39.224 --> 03:28:42.285]  No, the mythical Nazi, that's the pariah.
[03:28:42.285 --> 03:28:48.567]  If you are obsessed with chasing Nazis and white supremacists, you are essentially a Bigfoot chaser.
[03:28:48.567 --> 03:28:50.108]  Bigfoot is not a thing.
[03:28:50.868 --> 03:28:53.209]  We give you a lot more things to be concerned about.
[03:28:53.209 --> 03:28:56.691]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.

[03:32:56.719 --> 03:32:59.361]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.810 --> 03:33:20.021]  Why do I bring all this up?
[03:33:20.021 --> 03:33:24.104]  Because we have to understand that the left is not playing fair.
[03:33:24.104 --> 03:33:25.485]  They are playing to win.
[03:33:25.485 --> 03:33:28.688]  They have no interest in truth, no interest in justice.
[03:33:28.688 --> 03:33:31.490]  This is just... Trump has to go!
[03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:32.951]  If they could honestly believe
[03:33:33.624 --> 03:33:46.690]  I would say 40% of the DNC of Democrats, if they could push a button where Trump would suffer a debilitating, horrible way to die, flesh-eating disease, and they could watch it, I bet they would push that button.
[03:33:46.690 --> 03:33:49.912]  We're up against basically Gargamel from the Smurfs.
[03:33:49.912 --> 03:33:52.173]  We're up against a bad guy.
[03:33:52.173 --> 03:33:59.216]  And I was thinking the other day, say Hillary won, and it was discovered that Canada had meddled in the elections.
[03:33:59.216 --> 03:34:01.157]  What do you think the left would be doing today?
[03:34:01.727 --> 03:34:06.251]  They'd be saying, haha, suckers, oh sore losers, what's the matter?
[03:34:06.251 --> 03:34:11.595]  The last thing they would do would be even considering impeachment, they'd be laughing in our faces.
[03:34:11.595 --> 03:34:13.497]  And that's one thing that bugs me about the right.
[03:34:13.497 --> 03:34:16.299]  We're so determined to play fair and be nice.
[03:34:16.299 --> 03:34:17.640]  And no, here's the proof.
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:19.922]  Look, here's the document.
[03:34:19.922 --> 03:34:21.363]  Here's my evidence.
[03:34:21.363 --> 03:34:22.444]  They don't do evidence.
[03:34:22.444 --> 03:34:23.124]  They lie.
[03:34:23.124 --> 03:34:24.946]  This whole Kavanaugh thing.
[03:34:25.387 --> 03:34:28.089]  With this girl who claims it was attempted rape.
[03:34:28.089 --> 03:34:39.176]  And then we find out that she wore a brain-shaped pussy hat for a march and signed a petition trying to get Trump to change his views on immigration or something like that.
[03:34:39.176 --> 03:34:41.658]  She's a very politically active liberal.
[03:34:41.658 --> 03:34:48.242]  And coincidentally, she's just decided right now to accuse Kavanaugh of some high school sexual encounter.
[03:34:48.242 --> 03:34:50.563]  Now, there's one thing the left is going to do here.
[03:34:50.563 --> 03:34:51.364]  They're watching us.
[03:34:52.105 --> 03:34:56.408]  With bated breath, dying for us to say something like I just said, but much worse.
[03:34:56.408 --> 03:34:59.490]  They want Trump to go, ah forget it, she's a liar!
[03:34:59.490 --> 03:35:05.614]  Then they can go on the whole, these guys don't care about rape victims thing, and it does well with the female voters.
[03:35:05.614 --> 03:35:07.876]  You say, there's little kids!
[03:35:07.876 --> 03:35:10.597]  There's a baby that crossed the border and he's so hungry!
[03:35:10.597 --> 03:35:14.420]  No one goes, why did a woman bring a baby across the border?
[03:35:14.420 --> 03:35:17.382]  You couldn't have waited until he was a little healthier, a little older, a little tougher?
[03:35:18.058 --> 03:35:20.882]  Why are you bringing kids on a crime spree?
[03:35:20.882 --> 03:35:29.875]  Which, by the way, that trip, that distance, that whole route is basically a Tough Mudder relay race.
[03:35:29.875 --> 03:35:31.096]  It's brutal!
[03:35:31.096 --> 03:35:32.678]  You brought a little kid along with you?
[03:35:32.678 --> 03:35:33.419]  Why did you do that?
[03:35:33.419 --> 03:35:33.640]  Anyway...
[03:35:34.864 --> 03:35:41.788]  They are dying for the right, especially a Supreme Court judge, to be rash and dismissive with her.
[03:35:41.788 --> 03:35:48.211]  So that is why you'll notice Kellyanne Conway and everyone on the news is going, we want to be clear here.
[03:35:48.211 --> 03:35:50.132]  We are going to go take this to trial.
[03:35:50.132 --> 03:35:52.074]  Make sure we look at all the evidence.
[03:35:52.074 --> 03:35:52.994]  She needs to be heard.
[03:35:52.994 --> 03:35:56.676]  Because they can tell it's a setup to try to make you be dismissive.
[03:35:56.676 --> 03:36:00.218]  But civilians like me can go, meh, I'm not buying it.
[03:36:00.218 --> 03:36:00.598]  It stinks.
[03:36:03.314 --> 03:36:04.835]  So they're always playing games.
[03:36:04.835 --> 03:36:07.658]  I think that the lawfare with Soros is a game.
[03:36:07.658 --> 03:36:10.940]  I think the strange deaths around Hillary are a game.
[03:36:10.940 --> 03:36:19.307]  I think that this whole pretending that you're concerned about Russia meddling is all just propaganda, tricks and lies.
[03:36:19.307 --> 03:36:27.794]  And I think Alex Jones and I getting kicked off of Twitter and getting booted off social media is them saying the game isn't working.
[03:36:27.794 --> 03:36:32.057]  Charlottesville, I believe, was designed to take down people like me, Milo and Lauren.
[03:36:33.166 --> 03:36:38.348]  Links to me somehow, even though I clearly said I don't want nothing to do with it.
[03:36:38.348 --> 03:36:44.911]  And the tweet where I said I want nothing to do with the second one either, conveniently has disappeared because I'm off Twitter.
[03:36:44.911 --> 03:36:52.414]  And the local media would say, McInnes, Proud Boys founder, booted from Twitter shortly before Unite the Right.
[03:36:53.404 --> 03:36:59.986]  Well, technically, chronologically, yes, I guess it was, but the implication there is that, so I couldn't sit there and organize Unite the Right.
[03:36:59.986 --> 03:37:06.768]  So whatever money, whatever globalist money went into this myth, is still perpetuating, even though the lie failed.
[03:37:06.768 --> 03:37:08.128]  Or did it?
[03:37:08.128 --> 03:37:18.711]  And I also think it's interesting, the timing of when Alex and I were persecuted for, well, my thing I'm hearing now from my lawyers is promoting violence.
[03:37:19.810 --> 03:37:21.071]  Violence is out there, okay?
[03:37:21.071 --> 03:37:22.132]  It's like guns.
[03:37:22.132 --> 03:37:23.352]  Guns exist.
[03:37:23.352 --> 03:37:25.094]  We want good guys to have guns.
[03:37:25.094 --> 03:37:26.034]  Violence exists.
[03:37:26.034 --> 03:37:39.223]  Antifa, the socio-fascists, are the paramilitary wing of the Democratic Party, and they go to rallies, and they beat us, and they stab us with hammers, with knives, with gas, with M80s.
[03:37:39.223 --> 03:37:41.024]  They throw rocks at our heads.
[03:37:41.024 --> 03:37:43.666]  They split open our skulls with bike locks.
[03:37:43.666 --> 03:37:49.190]  My group has said, hey, we're going to defend ourselves, and God forbid we should enjoy that.
[03:37:50.430 --> 03:37:52.451]  That became promoting violence.
[03:37:52.451 --> 03:37:58.332]  So the left is so fascist that if you don't lie down and take it, you're violent.
[03:37:58.332 --> 03:37:58.832]  What is this?
[03:37:58.832 --> 03:37:59.852]  This is like Stalin.
[03:37:59.852 --> 03:38:00.912]  This is Mao.
[03:38:00.912 --> 03:38:02.673]  This is dictatorship stuff.
[03:38:02.673 --> 03:38:06.314]  Not benevolent dictators, tyrannical dictators.
[03:38:06.314 --> 03:38:09.214]  And so Rufio, our buddy Rufio is a proud boy.
[03:38:09.214 --> 03:38:11.855]  He had a beautiful punch.
[03:38:11.855 --> 03:38:16.416]  Knocked out an antifa so hard the guy was just unconscious and his body was erect.
[03:38:17.925 --> 03:38:20.309]  And it was that we called the punch heard around the world.
[03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:22.532]  I featured him on my show to talk about the punch.
[03:38:22.532 --> 03:38:25.336]  Alex featured him on his show to talk about the punch.
[03:38:25.336 --> 03:38:31.766]  I was banned shortly after Alex was banned shortly after and all Proud Boys accounts were immediately banned right after that.
[03:38:32.583 --> 03:38:33.744]  Why was that?
[03:38:33.744 --> 03:38:35.265]  Because we're glorifying violence?
[03:38:35.265 --> 03:38:36.065]  No.
[03:38:36.065 --> 03:38:38.467]  Because we are a threat to their paramilitary wing.
[03:38:38.467 --> 03:38:41.169]  Because their violence isn't working.
[03:38:41.169 --> 03:38:43.431]  You notice Antifa's still up on Twitter.
[03:38:43.431 --> 03:38:45.212]  They don't mind alt-left violence.
[03:38:45.212 --> 03:38:46.913]  They don't mind the sociofascists.
[03:38:46.913 --> 03:38:48.994]  They just mind when we defend ourselves.
[03:38:48.994 --> 03:38:52.497]  And they tried to do it through propaganda and lies to make us look bad and it's not working.
[03:38:52.497 --> 03:38:55.979]  There was just a rally in Denver for free speech.
[03:38:55.979 --> 03:39:01.183]  These proud boys grabbed, I'm told, first-hand accounts, that Antifa jumped on a cop
[03:39:02.103 --> 03:39:04.986]  And these Proud Boys grabbed the Antifa, ripped them off the cop.
[03:39:04.986 --> 03:39:08.389]  And cops love Proud Boys because Proud Boys love cops.
[03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:16.616]  And he's looking at suspension now because he said to them earlier, he said there was a video going around where he said, I know some of you came here to fight.
[03:39:16.616 --> 03:39:17.917]  I can tell that by what you're wearing.
[03:39:17.917 --> 03:39:19.399]  That's not happening today.
[03:39:20.037 --> 03:39:21.818]  And then he said, if you want to fight, stick around.
[03:39:21.818 --> 03:39:24.178]  I got a couple guys they also want to fight.
[03:39:24.178 --> 03:39:25.219]  Now that could mean anything.
[03:39:25.219 --> 03:39:30.000]  That could mean him and some cops want to have like a fun little spar session.
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:34.241]  Or it could mean I got some Antifa guys that want to fight and we'll let you fight them.
[03:39:34.241 --> 03:39:35.462]  No one knows what that means.
[03:39:35.462 --> 03:39:41.904]  And he also added later, I'm kidding of course, but this is what's going on in this country.
[03:39:41.904 --> 03:39:43.304]  There is this intense
[03:39:43.916 --> 03:39:52.198]  This scrutiny, this fine-toothed comb where they go through every facet of a, I don't even want to say conservative, of a non-liberal's life.
[03:39:52.813 --> 03:39:58.635]  Where you had slightly rough sex in high school, so you can't be a Supreme Court judge.
[03:39:58.635 --> 03:40:02.036]  You knew the guy who organized Charlottesville.
[03:40:02.036 --> 03:40:05.017]  Ergo, you killed Heather Heyer, so you have to be terrorized.
[03:40:05.017 --> 03:40:07.838]  Your family's social life has to be affected.
[03:40:07.838 --> 03:40:11.819]  If you know Alex Jones, and you... Ooh, conspiracy theories!
[03:40:11.819 --> 03:40:21.422]  If you are even open to the idea that the Deep State exists, even though James O'Keefe is about to prove that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, if you're open to any of this, if you're not 100% with the liberal cause,
[03:40:23.280 --> 03:40:45.505]  Even as the liberal cause drifts off into satellite town and has things like infinite gender and children are sexual beings and we need to have drag queens read books to kids and children should have hormone blockers so they don't suffer puberty and slavery is worse today in America than ever before and the president is a white supremacist Nazi.
[03:40:45.505 --> 03:40:48.846]  Even as they start saying that crazy radical stuff.
[03:40:48.846 --> 03:40:50.566]  If you're not with this crazy satellite,
[03:40:51.491 --> 03:40:54.879]  Then you're a Nazi who's going to start World War III, and we have to terrorize you.
[03:40:57.532 --> 03:41:04.817]  It's a strange thing to set up because what you're doing is you're setting up this scrutiny machine where everyone has a fine-tooth comb.
[03:41:04.817 --> 03:41:13.582]  And I think what's happening now with the right is we're going, okay, let me just pick up this giant fine-tooth comb and go through Hollywood.
[03:41:13.582 --> 03:41:14.543]  Oh, wow.
[03:41:14.543 --> 03:41:16.644]  It's rape central over there.
[03:41:16.644 --> 03:41:19.486]  You guys are disgusting animals.
[03:41:19.486 --> 03:41:22.668]  Looks like you're not so sanctimonious after all.
[03:41:22.668 --> 03:41:23.008]  Are you?
[03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:28.112]  They are cannibalizing each other now because they set up this crazy world.
[03:41:28.112 --> 03:41:30.274]  They ruined comedy with all their rules.
[03:41:30.274 --> 03:41:31.695]  They ruined movies.
[03:41:31.695 --> 03:41:39.180]  You can't watch an action movie now without some guy who looks like my baby... some chick who looks like my baby sister beating the crap out of ten Green Berets.
[03:41:39.180 --> 03:41:42.022]  They ruined everything with this social justice warrior dogma.
[03:41:42.022 --> 03:41:47.246]  We're over here on our own platforms, untouchable, making more money every time they ban us.
[03:41:47.246 --> 03:41:50.849]  The InfoWars became the number one app ever after they decided no one can hear it.
[03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:55.871]  And they are left to their own devices, which is a communist disgusting hellhole.
[03:41:55.871 --> 03:42:00.773]  Folks will be back to discuss some funner stuff now that I got that off my chest.
[03:42:00.773 --> 03:42:02.514]  And that's gonna be in a minute.
[03:42:03.963 --> 03:42:09.625]  So I'm preparing you to say goodbye, because I know you get separation anxiety when I just cut out like nothing.
[03:42:09.625 --> 03:42:19.089]  So I want to slowly ease you in to some words from our sponsors so you don't get all triggered and start shaking and convulsing and saying, you left me too fast!
[03:42:19.089 --> 03:42:22.030]  Actually, that is a good metaphor for the left today.
[03:42:22.030 --> 03:42:24.791]  They're not just crazy, they're crazy ex-girlfriends.
[03:42:24.791 --> 03:42:27.152]  You know the one that stalked you?
[03:42:27.152 --> 03:42:28.172]  They're like that.
[03:42:28.172 --> 03:42:29.413]  You know they can't beat you up.
[03:42:29.893 --> 03:42:36.480]  But they will smash your front window and scream and start bleeding on your desk until your boss goes, dude, I gotta let you go.
[03:42:36.480 --> 03:42:42.606]  This crazy lunatic woman, I don't know what you did to her, but she's terrorizing the whole office.
[03:42:42.606 --> 03:42:45.950]  Anyway, I'll be back to tell you how to deal with the crazy ex-girlfriend that is the left.

[03:44:54.034 --> 03:45:03.341]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[03:45:03.341 --> 03:45:09.445]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[03:45:09.445 --> 03:45:17.751]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I Dream of Jeannie and there's this purple gas.
[03:45:17.751 --> 03:45:21.053]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[03:45:21.053 --> 03:45:23.215]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[03:45:24.055 --> 03:45:29.116]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[03:45:29.116 --> 03:45:30.816]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[03:45:30.816 --> 03:45:32.036]  I'm breaking the contract.
[03:45:32.036 --> 03:45:33.957]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[03:45:33.957 --> 03:45:36.297]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[03:45:36.297 --> 03:45:40.038]  In fact, right now, it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:40.038 --> 03:45:43.438]  And we've got a good supply of it, but it'll be gone in a couple months.
[03:45:43.438 --> 03:45:46.099]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.
[03:45:46.099 --> 03:45:49.319]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is, I suggest you stock up on it.

[03:46:57.704 --> 03:47:00.345]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.160 --> 03:47:19.251]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:47:19.251 --> 03:47:21.096]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:24.724 --> 03:47:26.565]  Hammer back, folks!
[03:47:26.565 --> 03:47:35.387]  You know what people don't know about the new romantics?
[03:47:35.387 --> 03:47:43.209]  That scene in Britain where you had Human League and Flock of Seagulls and Simple Minds and all those.
[03:47:43.209 --> 03:47:47.630]  You'd see them in these white suits with their hair like that and you'd go, what a bunch of wimps.
[03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:49.371]  What a bunch of girly men.
[03:47:49.371 --> 03:47:49.951]  No, no, no, no.
[03:47:50.814 --> 03:47:55.577]  You see, that's back when the economy was booming in Britain, thanks to Thatcher's privatization.
[03:47:55.577 --> 03:47:59.959]  Blue-collar guys were busting their asses in factories all week.
[03:47:59.959 --> 03:48:00.940]  Tough guys.
[03:48:00.940 --> 03:48:02.120]  British men.
[03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:06.723]  And so when they partied on a Friday night, they were like, I'm going all out, mate!
[03:48:06.723 --> 03:48:15.207]  So with the glam, they'd have like orange suspenders, like Elton John-looking guys with big sunglasses and a funny hat and like big giant boots with big gold stars on the side.
[03:48:15.207 --> 03:48:18.509]  Or they'd dress up like a woman and be like, Hi, I'm a leaguey!
[03:48:18.509 --> 03:48:19.510]  Look at me, guys!
[03:48:20.376 --> 03:48:25.499]  And they would beat the tar out of you if you had a problem with their pink suit.
[03:48:25.499 --> 03:48:33.184]  So, back in 1980, if you saw a guy walking down the street who looked like he was in Human League, you'd just go, oh well mate, take it easy, don't worry.
[03:48:33.184 --> 03:48:35.485]  He'd be drunk out of his mind because they would party.
[03:48:35.485 --> 03:48:37.587]  I mean, they worked hard and they played hard.
[03:48:37.587 --> 03:48:40.728]  But don't sleep on flock of seagulls.
[03:48:40.728 --> 03:48:42.069]  They were tough, believe it or not.
[03:48:44.312 --> 03:48:56.924]  So I want to wrap this up with some optimism, but I want to go over my whole sort of hypothesis here, which is, and I think this is relevant to mention the Alex Jones Show, because from a far long, long time ago, I was like, oh, that's that crazy guy with those nutty theories.
[03:48:56.924 --> 03:48:58.545]  And then you start looking into it.
[03:48:58.545 --> 03:49:04.391]  I wrote an article on tackymag.com actually about the Hillary murders and how curious they are.
[03:49:04.391 --> 03:49:06.993]  And I only focused on the ones that had a ton of evidence.
[03:49:06.993 --> 03:49:09.055]  But as you start looking into this stuff, you go,
[03:49:10.057 --> 03:49:18.740]  I was listening to the left's narrative, where George Soros has a big bucket of money, and anyone who punches a conservative gets a hundred dollars.
[03:49:18.740 --> 03:49:22.062]  Although, something that crazy does happen.
[03:49:22.062 --> 03:49:29.164]  You looked at the Kavanaugh hearings, where we saw a woman getting paid from an envelope.
[03:49:29.164 --> 03:49:30.045]  A protester.
[03:49:30.045 --> 03:49:31.605]  Here's your money, lady.
[03:49:31.605 --> 03:49:34.266]  Good job screaming and screwing up this hearing.
[03:49:34.266 --> 03:49:36.427]  Great job.
[03:49:36.427 --> 03:49:38.188]  But there's a gray area in between.
[03:49:39.269 --> 03:49:40.181]  And Soros!
[03:49:40.606 --> 03:50:09.572]  We can be funding lawfare and terrorizing people based on a decision made years and years ago that says, oh yes, I don't know how to do George Soros' accent, oh yes, one thing, the Nazi thing I don't like, so have anyone who mentioned that catch them up and stuff, give them parking tickets, not parking tickets, I guess you can't do that, but pay Media Matters to look into it and really bug them all the time and get some stuff, maybe even have a rally where they look bad.
[03:50:10.052 --> 03:50:13.455]  That's gonna be my new George Soros, no matter what he actually sounds like from now on.
[03:50:13.455 --> 03:50:14.255]  Hey, I'm George Soros!
[03:50:14.255 --> 03:50:15.717]  What are you guys doing?
[03:50:15.717 --> 03:50:19.780]  Eh... For example, here's another thing that I know something fishy is going on.
[03:50:19.780 --> 03:50:27.406]  Someone will put together a compilation of every time I've said something untowards and just, like, take the joke part out so it sounds like a racist thing.
[03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:31.843]  And that requires watching 700 hours of video.
[03:50:31.843 --> 03:50:33.284]  Now, we all have enemies.
[03:50:33.284 --> 03:50:35.506]  But who watches 700 hours of a show?
[03:50:35.506 --> 03:50:39.189]  I wouldn't watch 700 hours of Alex Jones in a row.
[03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:40.030]  I mean, I love the guy.
[03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.810]  I love this show.
[03:50:40.810 --> 03:50:43.773]  I don't have time for that kind of attention.
[03:50:44.714 --> 03:50:49.137]  And Media Matters and Right Wing Watch, they'll parse every minute of my show.
[03:50:49.137 --> 03:50:49.878]  Who's doing that?
[03:50:49.878 --> 03:50:50.999]  I think they're getting a check.
[03:50:50.999 --> 03:50:56.943]  Now, it's not originally from Soros, but it'll be from something like the Center for Democratic Progress or some other name.
[03:50:56.943 --> 03:51:01.867]  And that group will get a check from a company called Helping Americans Love Again.
[03:51:01.867 --> 03:51:06.870]  And then that company, the company that gives them money will be called Free Hugs for Everyone.
[03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:10.333]  Eventually, it's completely untraceable back to Soros.
[03:51:10.333 --> 03:51:11.754]  But he starts this first domino.
[03:51:12.267 --> 03:51:17.111]  That doesn't sound like a conspiracy theory to me, and a lot of this stuff you can see he admits.
[03:51:17.111 --> 03:51:20.994]  He reads Soros' books and he's very open about his Nazi past, unfortunately for him.
[03:51:20.994 --> 03:51:30.803]  And he's also very open about the billions of dollars he's poured in over the years to various leftist causes, and that includes BLM and Antifa.
[03:51:30.803 --> 03:51:33.745]  Now Antifa goes, oh yeah, where's my check?
[03:51:33.745 --> 03:51:35.466]  Sorry dude, it's like an Indian reservation.
[03:51:35.466 --> 03:51:38.109]  It doesn't actually make it down to the actual people.
[03:51:38.109 --> 03:51:39.450]  The top brass keeps it all.
[03:51:39.855 --> 03:51:41.476]  It's just like big government.
[03:51:41.476 --> 03:51:43.358]  The administrators, they keep the money.
[03:51:43.358 --> 03:51:47.721]  They make the nice signs that were made at Kinko's for you to carry around.
[03:51:47.721 --> 03:51:49.882]  You don't get, you might get a hundred bucks.
[03:51:49.882 --> 03:51:53.625]  Some of these protesters get a hundred bucks, but they don't get real money.
[03:51:53.625 --> 03:51:55.547]  So what do you do about all this?
[03:51:55.547 --> 03:51:57.888]  What do you do about getting fired?
[03:51:57.888 --> 03:52:04.853]  I can't, I, sorry, I get so many people that say to me, Gavin, I want to be honest and talk about free speech, not be racist, not be antisemitic.
[03:52:04.853 --> 03:52:07.715]  Just talk the way my dad talks in bars, like a normal person.
[03:52:07.715 --> 03:52:08.196]  You know what I mean?
[03:52:08.869 --> 03:52:14.595]  And not think that four-year-olds should be wearing a dress?
[03:52:14.595 --> 03:52:16.617]  What the hell is that dog doing?
[03:52:16.617 --> 03:52:19.880]  Why did you bring a dog to the studio today?
[03:52:19.880 --> 03:52:23.744]  Anyway, I want to do that, but I might get fired.
[03:52:23.744 --> 03:52:26.686]  Here's my solution to your problem, sir.
[03:52:26.686 --> 03:52:27.207]  Get fired.
[03:52:28.160 --> 03:52:29.921]  I've been fired a million times.
[03:52:29.921 --> 03:52:31.763]  I've lost entire careers.
[03:52:31.763 --> 03:52:34.004]  And I'm still making money because this is America.
[03:52:34.004 --> 03:52:36.326]  When you put your nose to the grindstone, you make money.
[03:52:36.326 --> 03:52:39.948]  I'm making more money this year than I've ever made in my life.
[03:52:39.948 --> 03:52:46.793]  And that's because I'm just honest, and I bust my ass, and America rewards those who bust their ass.
[03:52:46.793 --> 03:52:48.914]  America punishes those who live in fear.
[03:52:48.914 --> 03:52:52.417]  And the more you capitulate, and the more you apologize, the more you will suffer.
[03:52:52.417 --> 03:52:54.138]  And that includes monetarily.
[03:52:54.867 --> 03:52:59.112]  What about that Kramer guy you were talking about who yelled the N-word and his career's over?
[03:52:59.112 --> 03:53:00.614]  Yes, because he capitulated.
[03:53:00.614 --> 03:53:01.315]  He apologized.
[03:53:01.315 --> 03:53:04.198]  He should have been doing stand-up the next night.
[03:53:04.198 --> 03:53:08.924]  With the World Trade Center, we should have been rebuilding the towers on September 12th.
[03:53:08.924 --> 03:53:11.507]  We should have had the blueprints out from the old towers.
[03:53:12.256 --> 03:53:14.837]  Dusted them off and recreated the same towers.
[03:53:14.837 --> 03:53:16.937]  You dust yourself off, you get back on top.
[03:53:16.937 --> 03:53:26.820]  I heard Ben Shapiro, whom I admire, say that, you know, colleges are Marxist hellholes, what should I do if I don't toe the line, the liberal narrative, I won't graduate.
[03:53:26.820 --> 03:53:37.022]  And he said, well, you can't fail, you can't get booted out of college, so just toe the line and then make tons of money and say, ha ha, at the end, I'm rich, I was lying.
[03:53:37.748 --> 03:53:39.129]  I disagree with Ben on that.
[03:53:39.129 --> 03:53:52.354]  I say write the truth, talk about your various conspiracy theories, back them up, admit that you don't know this but you think this, this there's hard evidence for, this there isn't, just my gut, and then get an F!
[03:53:52.354 --> 03:53:55.736]  Get booted out of college for telling the truth!
[03:53:55.736 --> 03:53:56.356]  Get in trouble!
[03:53:57.188 --> 03:53:59.010]  You know, you don't want your marriage to fall apart.
[03:53:59.010 --> 03:54:05.536]  I'm not saying that you sit there screaming at dinner parties until no one wants to have you and your wife over for dinner.
[03:54:05.536 --> 03:54:08.378]  I'm not saying be a dogmatic bore.
[03:54:08.378 --> 03:54:14.023]  But when the time comes to be honest, to be yourself, to stand up, stand up.
[03:54:14.023 --> 03:54:15.585]  Look at Tommy Robinson.
[03:54:15.585 --> 03:54:19.608]  He recognizes there's an Islamic scourge in America.
[03:54:19.608 --> 03:54:21.550]  And this is something I'm glad I still have time to get to.
[03:54:23.689 --> 03:54:37.255]  I was saying earlier that if we're going to aim our pariah machine at someone, how about someone who works at Big Pharma, like Purdue Pharmaceuticals, who also, by the way, own the patent to the generic heroin, and also are working on a patent for the cure!
[03:54:37.255 --> 03:54:39.996]  Not the band, the cure to heroin!
[03:54:39.996 --> 03:54:45.778]  So, it's right out of a Superman movie, where they give you a disease and then they make money off the cure.
[03:54:45.778 --> 03:54:49.400]  That's one group that deserves the kind of status these non-racists keep getting.
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:52.261]  And when I say non-racists, I mean people who are accused of being Nazis.
[03:54:53.069 --> 03:54:55.811]  But another group would be Islam.
[03:54:55.811 --> 03:54:58.693]  All the things you say about Mike Pence being homophobic.
[03:54:58.693 --> 03:55:01.315]  Mike Pence doesn't throw gays off buildings.
[03:55:01.315 --> 03:55:04.537]  All the things you say about Trump and his pussy joke being sexist.
[03:55:04.537 --> 03:55:10.662]  Trump isn't pushing for Sharia law, where a woman can be beaten if she doesn't have sex with her husband.
[03:55:10.662 --> 03:55:14.825]  Where a woman's testimony in court is worth half that of a man's.
[03:55:14.825 --> 03:55:19.908]  You talk about racism all the time because you think that guy knew a guy who knew a guy who was in Charlottesville.
[03:55:19.908 --> 03:55:22.130]  Islam is steeped in racism.
[03:55:22.523 --> 03:55:24.964]  Radical Islam and Moderate Islam.
[03:55:24.964 --> 03:55:29.406]  You know, they're still practicing slavery today in North Africa.
[03:55:29.406 --> 03:55:30.887]  You want to buy a black guy?
[03:55:30.887 --> 03:55:33.288]  They're 400 bucks in Libya.
[03:55:33.288 --> 03:55:36.509]  Shouldn't that bother you just a little bit?
[03:55:36.509 --> 03:55:47.174]  So every trope that they heap on innocent men like me and Alex and you and Milo and Lauren and Stefan Molyneux and Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson and even Joe Rogan.
[03:55:47.174 --> 03:55:51.456]  All of those tropes they heap on those guys are, which don't exist, are
[03:55:51.698 --> 03:55:54.999]  It's blindingly obvious when you look at radical Islam.
[03:55:54.999 --> 03:55:56.839]  And no, this is not a racist thing.
[03:55:56.839 --> 03:55:58.680]  I love me some Indians.
[03:55:58.680 --> 03:55:59.400]  Sikhs.
[03:55:59.400 --> 03:56:08.842]  There are so many cultures, even Mexicans, even Hispanics, the Catholic Hispanics, do assimilate when they come in in normal numbers.
[03:56:08.842 --> 03:56:13.743]  It's the 13 million being heaped on in one big plop that makes it difficult to assimilate.
[03:56:13.743 --> 03:56:17.724]  You almost can't assimilate when you come in a group that large.
[03:56:17.724 --> 03:56:18.944]  It's almost unnatural.
[03:56:20.575 --> 03:56:26.938]  But there's something about Islam that seems incongruous with the West and the left doesn't want to talk about it because it sounds racist.
[03:56:26.938 --> 03:56:30.780]  So they'd rather just invent racist and go, uh, you, you look like my dad.
[03:56:30.780 --> 03:56:32.601]  I'm making you the bad guy.
[03:56:32.601 --> 03:56:34.362]  I'm going to try and ruin your life.
[03:56:34.362 --> 03:56:48.689]  And what I say to those people whose lives are being ruined is stand up for yourself, fight, fight back, laugh in their face, try to see the humor in it all, and know that the truth runs marathons and lies run in small sprints.
[03:56:48.689 --> 03:56:50.070]  These people aren't going to breed.
[03:56:50.782 --> 03:56:51.662]  They aren't going to last.
[03:56:51.662 --> 03:56:53.103]  They aren't going to be employed.
[03:56:53.103 --> 03:56:55.223]  They don't thrive, these social justice warriors.
[03:56:55.223 --> 03:56:57.263]  They don't become ministers of industry.
[03:56:57.263 --> 03:56:58.784]  They have no work ethic.
[03:56:58.784 --> 03:57:06.685]  These socialists, when they finally move out of their mommy's basement, get punched in the face by the reality of economics, and they fail.
[03:57:06.685 --> 03:57:18.548]  So I know this is a crazy time, and I know it's incredibly discouraging, but I want to tell, especially the wives of conservatives, the wives of pundits, the children of these pundits, that this will pass.
[03:57:19.409 --> 03:57:23.410]  And we will look back the same way we looked at the Salem witch trial.
[03:57:23.410 --> 03:57:34.734]  What in the Sam hell was going on in 2013 to 2020, right before Trump won for the second time?
[03:57:34.734 --> 03:57:37.195]  What an insane time we lived in.
[03:57:37.195 --> 03:57:38.076]  Thanks for having me, folks.
[03:57:38.076 --> 03:57:44.318]  Please go to CRTV.com for more of this incredibly valuable information and my remarkably charismatic personality.
