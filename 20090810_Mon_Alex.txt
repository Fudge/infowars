[00:31.560 --> 00:41.960]  so many bad things are happening I am just completely blown away by the
[00:41.960 --> 00:47.200]  fact we're actually living in but the old-timers talked about for so long when
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.520]  the world government openly comes out in full view of everybody and tries to set
[00:52.520 --> 00:56.480]  up their planetary government under an environmental dictatorship under the
[00:56.480 --> 01:07.640]  guise of saving the earth it is really happening now my friends and the
[01:07.640 --> 01:12.400]  information I have is so important the news items we have are just so important
[01:12.400 --> 01:17.480]  I want to try to calmly go over all of this information today here on the
[01:17.480 --> 01:25.720]  radio and I want to the first couple hours maybe the whole four hours open
[01:25.720 --> 01:35.040]  the phones up for listeners on any issue any news article any question any
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.480]  comment if you agree with me if you disagree with me you want to laud what

[01:50.760 --> 01:59.960]  one the country is on the edge of revolution the question is what type of
[01:59.960 --> 02:05.280]  revolution is that going to be the establishment is desperate to make it a
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.800]  polarized political issue of left versus right right versus left black versus
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.760]  white so that they can divide and conquer and play all of the political
[02:15.760 --> 02:23.240]  anger play it off against the public instead of the public getting together
[02:23.240 --> 02:28.000]  and bringing justice to the offshore corporations engage in a criminal
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.400]  corporate takeover of the United States I'm also seeing just such amazing
[02:35.400 --> 02:41.440]  attacks on free speech here in the United States just vicious at every
[02:41.440 --> 02:48.240]  level legislatively on the internet on the streets of the United States and
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.680]  we're seeing such ball-faced lies from the party in power who's busy carrying
[02:53.680 --> 02:58.480]  the ball right now for the globalist being the Democrats and the Republicans
[02:58.480 --> 03:01.200]  were in power they'd be carrying the ball just as viciously against the
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.600]  Republic but right now they can try to build their political power base again
[03:05.600 --> 03:09.320]  by posing as if they're against the New World Order now there are some
[03:09.320 --> 03:14.440]  Republicans and some Democrats that are genuine and a few independence that are
[03:14.440 --> 03:18.520]  genuine doesn't mean I completely agree with all their policies but they do
[03:18.520 --> 03:22.160]  actually represent the people their constituents and they actually are not
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.200]  controlled by big corporate global interest Ron Paul Dennis Kucinich

[09:56.160 --> 10:00.640]  something you've witnessed in your community that you think is important I
[10:00.640 --> 10:06.240]  would like to hear on the Alex Jones Journal today we do this occasionally
[10:06.240 --> 10:09.640]  specifically throw out a few topics though that I would like to hear from
[10:09.640 --> 10:13.960]  you on but you can bring up any subject you'd like we're getting confirmed
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.920]  reports that FedEx Kinkos at multiple locations we're getting this from
[10:19.920 --> 10:26.800]  multiple individuals will not copy the Obama Joker saying it is a hate crime
[10:26.800 --> 10:32.240]  hate speech and that they will not do anything political and notice 501c3
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.200]  with churches the first amendment says Congress shall make no law respecting
[10:36.200 --> 10:42.440]  establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and
[10:42.440 --> 10:45.400]  then they came to him in the 50s and said oh just sign a form for your tax
[10:45.400 --> 10:48.320]  exemption not knowing that was a corporate trick to sign them into a
[10:48.320 --> 10:54.280]  contract agreeing to be a charity not a church now they were outside of the
[10:54.280 --> 10:58.520]  first amendment and had gone into a charity and had gone into corporate
[10:58.520 --> 11:02.560]  rules created by the Congress it's the same thing here so so now they're
[11:02.560 --> 11:07.520]  telling businesses oh you've got to read what people want copied and be
[11:07.520 --> 11:11.440]  political police be tattletales and we have confirmed it's all over the
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.200]  Washington Times at New York Times Washington Post and some national media
[11:16.200 --> 11:22.440]  is saying it's good they're defending it we of course broke this last Sunday
[11:22.440 --> 11:27.000]  Aaron Dykes a listener broke it sent us an email saying have you noticed on the
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.800]  White House website that it says that report anybody criticizing the
[11:33.800 --> 11:37.760]  president cap and trade health care report name and number where they live
[11:37.760 --> 11:43.400]  report your neighbors for anything fishy about the president implying talking
[11:43.400 --> 11:48.000]  about him is illegal and now we have videos of people coming up and ripping
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.520]  down Obama posters going after our listeners in the contest all over the
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.360]  country from San Antonio to New York we've got the videos they believe even
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.640]  on poster boards outside businesses where they want people to hang posters
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.160]  they run up instantly and rip them down they're literally under equivalent of
[12:07.160 --> 12:13.640]  Soviet or Nazi mind control believing it's illegal and they'll say you're not
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.600]  allowed to criticize the president so so they've got people so dumb down in
[12:18.600 --> 12:22.600]  America they believe the first amendment not only doesn't exist but is bad
[12:22.600 --> 12:31.400]  and so you walk into a FedEx kinkos and they say no no and then they give you a
[12:31.400 --> 12:36.120]  form saying this is political information we don't allow that now I mean
[12:36.120 --> 12:40.600]  ladies and gentlemen I told you about Raymond Tegh went to his Baptist Church
[12:40.600 --> 12:44.280]  big one in Dripping Springs and they handed out to everybody he gave me a
[12:44.280 --> 12:49.680]  copy of it saying no one is to even talk about politics when you're at a church
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.760]  picnic or if you go to after church with friends from the church to a
[12:54.760 --> 12:59.920]  cafeteria or something you do not talk about politics I mean this country is
[12:59.920 --> 13:04.040]  just so fried and then I read the comments on the YouTube videos as they
[13:04.040 --> 13:07.440]  pull down our video our videos because they go file fake complaints saying it's
[13:07.440 --> 13:14.600]  calling for murder and calling for hate crimes and they laugh and giggle and say
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.960]  criticizing the president he's black it's racist and you think it's a joke but
[13:18.960 --> 13:24.280]  you click on their their handles and you go and it's pro-Obama pages that have
[13:24.280 --> 13:28.760]  actually produced pro-Obama videos it's not a spoof it's not a joke we list some
[13:28.760 --> 13:33.240]  of their names you can go read them for yourself they say you're just hot Alex
[13:33.240 --> 13:39.120]  is hired by the health care companies and big oil he's evil let's ban him and
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.880]  they're doing it successfully and then celebrating stabbing America and the
[13:43.880 --> 13:47.040]  first amendment directly in the heart I mean these people are to complete nuts
[13:47.040 --> 13:50.680]  don't you fools understand your whole future is being destroyed the bankers
[13:50.680 --> 13:54.840]  are raping you know they really believe Obama's gonna pay for their house and
[13:54.840 --> 13:57.880]  give them a job and pay for their car you've seen them at all the town halls
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.440]  going oh thank you president I don't have to worry about my house payment or my
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.640]  car anymore meanwhile they're losing everything they got Obama works for the
[14:05.640 --> 14:09.720]  new world order you people and it doesn't matter commenters will say hey
[14:09.720 --> 14:14.240]  Alex Jones confronted Bush Alex Jones exposed Bush and then they'll put
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.440]  comments up and then links to the videos in the YouTube comments and they'll
[14:18.440 --> 14:23.360]  scream back on the next comment shut up liar it's not true he's a Klansman and
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.280]  they'll put a link up here's Alex bullhorning the clan shut up racist white

[14:31.640 --> 14:36.880]  person and folks it's real I've run into Obama supporters people that I've known
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.680]  for over a decade who suddenly don't like me and and suddenly actually get
[14:42.680 --> 14:49.880]  wild looks in their eyes and get angry at me I went to my mother's 60th birthday
[14:49.880 --> 14:56.080]  yesterday some of her friends were there and I mean it wasn't as bad as some of
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.400]  the other cases but one one guy I've known for many years he actually started
[15:00.400 --> 15:04.200]  getting mad when I'm known this guy probably I don't know more than 10
[15:04.200 --> 15:14.120]  years I don't know probably probably probably 14 years yeah and I mean he
[15:14.120 --> 15:19.840]  just was like because see they invest in the idea that they beat Bush Bush was
[15:19.840 --> 15:24.440]  corrupt and bad they repudiated evil America still good everything's fine
[15:24.440 --> 15:32.360]  he's gonna fix it and they don't want to hear they were conned they're invested
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.200]  this happens over and over again with people that are in Ponzi schemes you
[15:36.200 --> 15:39.960]  you hear about him every week usually it's a country club some middle-class
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.520]  nouveau riche area where people think they're wealthy and powerful because you
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.760]  know they got a million dollar house and a con artist will come into the club and
[15:47.760 --> 15:51.880]  he'll he'll say is a Rockefeller or Rothschild that's usually the MO you've
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.520]  all seen these national cases and he'll get a few old ladies to invest in they'll
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.640]  make you know 50% return in a year and they gotta run the scam over a couple
[16:01.640 --> 16:05.840]  years and by the time he then drops the hammer he gets everybody to go from
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.040]  investing a few thousand to a million and you know they he might take 30 40 50
[16:12.040 --> 16:15.400]  people in the area he might take them for 50 million take everything they've
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.960]  gotten he skips town and they still believe when they go to court about it
[16:20.960 --> 16:25.080]  they still think it was a real investment even as the FBI explains it was a
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.200]  fraud they just think he stole the investment money you understand what
[16:30.200 --> 16:34.800]  I'm saying they really think the guy posing as Rockefeller Rothschild or
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.040]  Astor I mean when I was going to college there was a guy doing this to people and
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.760]  I was telling people in college no it's a scam don't let him borrow your car don't
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.120]  give him money and then they'd always laugh you're just jealous I know an
[16:47.120 --> 16:53.600]  Astor you know I had a girl friend who had a friend who I knew real well who
[16:53.600 --> 16:58.640]  this guy was you know going out whether he was having sex whether he was getting
[16:58.640 --> 17:02.600]  money from her you know she was a little wealthy you know college girl and I
[17:02.600 --> 17:06.880]  said it's a scam he's not really an Astor you know she thought she that's
[17:06.880 --> 17:12.760]  how the con game works she thought she'd found the meal ticket because you
[17:12.760 --> 17:15.880]  know that's what they send these you know young rich girls to find somebody else
[17:15.880 --> 17:20.360]  another rich family like for like and oh my gosh she found an Astor and when
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.240]  they were all said and done the guy was able to even con the family and I
[17:25.240 --> 17:28.480]  forget it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars over the next year that
[17:28.480 --> 17:31.760]  this guy sucked out of her and he was sucking off a couple other little rich
[17:31.760 --> 17:36.880]  girls because they're always down and out and they need a little help because
[17:36.880 --> 17:39.680]  they're you know because their parents are being mean to them and you know won't
[17:39.680 --> 17:46.720]  give them their 200 million inheritance they're supposed to get and it's all a
[17:46.720 --> 17:52.520]  scam the guy's name is Bob Smith you know but it doesn't matter even after they
[17:52.520 --> 17:57.040]  get scammed they will get mad at you I remember I remember I mean I was in
[17:57.040 --> 18:02.160]  college but I wasn't a fool I knew the classic con game I guess because I read
[18:02.160 --> 18:07.280]  the newspaper and I'd heard about it or hell they even have TV shows and dramas
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.880]  where they show what con artists do I think I learned about it from TV from
[18:10.880 --> 18:15.800]  you know from but no they they didn't want to believe they were being conned
[18:15.800 --> 18:21.480]  and it's the same thing with Obama and so even after they get taken for all this
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.440]  money they still believe oh no I really invested with an heir to the Rockefeller
[18:25.440 --> 18:29.240]  fortune he just skipped town with all the investment money he'd made no he
[18:29.240 --> 18:34.120]  never invested the money he used the scam money he had from other Ponzi
[18:34.120 --> 18:38.240]  schemes he'd run to drive a nice car to live in a house in the neighborhood that
[18:38.240 --> 18:43.400]  he was renting and to scam you and there's a sucker born every minute they
[18:43.400 --> 18:48.400]  like it they like being scammed as long as the person's wearing a suit and a
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.040]  polo shirt they want to be defrauded it's the same thing Obama's a slick
[18:54.040 --> 19:02.840]  mac daddy con artist smooth talking you know slow walking smooth talking scam

[21:55.240 --> 22:06.120]  in the New World Order's war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the
[22:06.120 --> 22:11.440]  spear we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[22:11.440 --> 22:15.840]  think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[22:15.840 --> 22:19.560]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[22:19.560 --> 22:27.620]  while Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[22:27.620 --> 22:33.240]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[22:33.240 --> 22:39.840]  oligarchs that's fascist. It's not about left or right it's about a one-world
[22:39.840 --> 22:46.040]  government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his
[22:46.040 --> 22:52.280]  real agenda get your copy of the Obama deception today at info wars.com or

[23:03.400 --> 23:06.960]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[23:06.960 --> 23:10.640]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become
[23:10.640 --> 23:14.280]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold
[23:14.280 --> 23:17.400]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[23:17.400 --> 23:21.480]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[23:21.480 --> 23:26.920]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[23:30.960 --> 23:34.880]  best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you

[24:37.000 --> 24:41.400]  working for peaceful the establishment is provocaturing and wants it to be
[24:41.400 --> 24:47.960]  violent so we need to remain calm and not give in and catch them setting people
[24:47.960 --> 24:53.240]  up as we've been doing and then further discredit the enemy foreign banks that's
[24:53.240 --> 24:57.160]  all this is corrupt corporate banking takeover they want Republicans and
[24:57.160 --> 25:00.880]  Democrats fighting with each other Obama was the bait the whole time
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.600]  Tarpley was absolutely right about how they were gonna have youth brigades and
[25:04.600 --> 25:08.080]  thugs beating people up and how they wanted to create racial division and
[25:08.080 --> 25:12.680]  play the race card he was absolutely right every day I just get more respect
[25:12.680 --> 25:16.680]  for Tarpley it's stunning the two books he wrote about Obama before the election

[27:04.680 --> 27:11.160]  they're having this move because the L3 communications in Lockheed Martin are I
[27:11.160 --> 27:14.680]  don't know tripling a hundred percent expanding they're hiring eight to ten
[27:14.680 --> 27:20.160]  thousand people and they're coming in here to improve our nationals that the
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.800]  new national security plan that they have for us so yeah we have to move it
[27:24.800 --> 27:28.860]  the end of the month now let me ask you they are confirming then that all these
[27:28.860 --> 27:34.160]  Humvees with police equipment are for domestic operations and now that we
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.480]  have no confirmation that I do have a two in five people one that actually does
[27:38.480 --> 27:44.000]  work for Lockheed Martin and he is he he works for the nuclear division the
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.160]  gas fusions plant in Paducah, Kentucky and the other one actually works for L3
[27:49.160 --> 27:54.200]  but was just fired the other day and I don't know what reason he was fired for
[27:54.200 --> 28:00.040]  having to make any kind of contact with him since then but I've tried to get
[28:00.040 --> 28:03.920]  him to release some kind of information to me to get confirmation of what's
[28:03.920 --> 28:09.600]  going on I've even got more video footage of bluegrass station of all the
[28:09.600 --> 28:13.400]  others they've had these large mysterious containers come in they've
[28:13.400 --> 28:18.560]  been paving all the graph like the grass median they're paving all them for
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.800]  parking lot it's there's a lot of construction going on we're in a 44
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.400]  thousand square foot warehouse we're having to condense out of here by the
[28:26.400 --> 28:31.640]  end of month because of all the military personnel coming in the civilians
[28:31.640 --> 28:34.960]  that are going to be hired by the government yeah I mean obviously the
[28:34.960 --> 28:38.640]  government's just you know getting bigger and bigger when we were told it's
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.960]  going to get smaller smaller but absolutely the real economy is being
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.560]  destroyed by design everything's being folded into the government so that the
[28:48.560 --> 28:53.600]  profits of the government slash private industry agreements can be conduit to
[28:53.600 --> 28:58.800]  smaller and smaller hands and it's just government is exploding in size it's
[28:58.800 --> 29:04.080]  all being done by design and God help this country well listen I'm going to

[33:30.200 --> 33:35.000]  in America searching US citizens and the John War Defense Authorization Act and
[33:35.000 --> 33:39.440]  the Army Times and Northcom have all announced that they plan to quote take

[33:43.120 --> 33:50.360]  forcibly inoculate us that's all ABC news Fox seeing in and so when you hear

[33:55.320 --> 34:03.520]  police equipment that's probably for the United States but we don't know
[34:03.520 --> 34:07.560]  regardless we do know them that they're out conditioning the public to accept
[34:07.560 --> 34:15.120]  this and it's just absolutely out of control and we do know that the media is
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.480]  trying to say it's bad that citizens are going to town halls and voicing their
[34:19.480 --> 34:22.640]  displeasure with the government that's what town halls are for so they can
[34:22.640 --> 34:27.800]  quote hear what you want but no they've actually been little patty cake meetings
[34:27.800 --> 34:32.960]  where they try to co-op the public into submitting but as the public loses all
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.280]  their liberties and freedoms and their bank accounts and their houses and then
[34:37.280 --> 34:41.600]  their kids get drafted into compulsory domestic and foreign military service
[34:41.600 --> 34:45.760]  and his CIA takes over the local communities publicly you hear all the
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.040]  radio and TV ads there I mean this is this is it we're going like China
[34:50.040 --> 34:55.680]  during Mao or Germany during Hitler it's really happening and so as we
[34:55.680 --> 34:59.080]  convert to this system they're just going to cancel town halls and it's now
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.040]  being announced in USA today and the st. Louis post dispatch and other papers
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.120]  that they're canceling most the town halls and meetings so and they're going
[35:08.120 --> 35:11.000]  to go ahead and close down the Capitol that's why they've already built a
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.280]  visitor center you get to visit now they're getting ready to shut down
[35:14.280 --> 35:20.400]  visiting the Capitol for the slaves if you jump through 500 hoops you might be
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.960]  able to see it and they're going to lock down all the counties and cities and
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.960]  we're going to be a giant third world cesspit with police that will pull you
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.760]  over and blow your head off on the side of the road I mean this is what we are
[35:32.760 --> 35:36.960]  now we we're owned by offshore criminal banks that stole the country and the
[35:36.960 --> 35:39.960]  police are here to make sure the ownership continues fraudulently of
[35:39.960 --> 35:45.600]  course the cops don't know that I was talking to a former Austin cop who
[35:45.600 --> 35:50.880]  quit this weekend and he had been in there two years and he just quit because
[35:50.880 --> 35:54.520]  he said yeah they just tell us to beat up people on 6th Street beat up young
[35:54.520 --> 35:58.640]  women and we're told to just absolutely put the fear of God into people we're
[35:58.640 --> 36:05.160]  told to be brutal we're told to be abusive we're told to do this and you're
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.800]  promoted if you do and this is what's happened to America we're now controlled
[36:09.800 --> 36:15.000]  by criminals and it's also foreign banks can fully have their way with us these
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.560]  foreign banks launder the drug money they ship the heroin and cocaine in they
[36:18.560 --> 36:22.800]  own the big drug companies that push all the psychotropic on the public we're
[36:22.800 --> 36:28.760]  run by criminally insane criminals and I you know I'm not anybody's enemy the
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.080]  police the military anybody I know most of you are just manipulated and brain
[36:33.080 --> 36:36.520]  washed like everybody else or if you are awake you're scared and don't know
[36:36.520 --> 36:40.640]  what to do and you try to just do a good job keep your head down so you never get
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.080]  promoted and you see scum getting promoted I understand and I you know
[36:47.080 --> 36:52.600]  I'm not in a as they say a pissing contest it's the only way to describe it
[36:52.600 --> 36:57.760]  with people I wish it wasn't like this but we got a bunch of macho hardcore
[36:57.760 --> 37:02.400]  criminals who all one up each other in fact later in the third hour I'm gonna
[37:02.400 --> 37:09.480]  read from these court transcripts about blackwater the raping little girls in
[37:09.480 --> 37:16.400]  big gang rape parties the swapping each other's wives and a lot of people I
[37:16.400 --> 37:19.520]  noticed in the media are commenting going sounds like fun you know in these
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.240]  mainstream news articles that are posted you know how it destroys because the
[37:24.240 --> 37:29.280]  you know the Iraqi children they're abusing their subhuman to the public so
[37:29.280 --> 37:32.520]  the sub so the public doesn't care you know they've made them subhuman so it's
[37:32.520 --> 37:37.840]  funny but then they get back reportedly in these federal cases to blackwater
[37:37.840 --> 37:45.200]  headquarters and it talks about how they wife swap in these big orgies and
[37:45.200 --> 37:50.520]  people think that's cute and funny see once you become evil you can't even
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.920]  recognize evil anymore I can't think of anything
[37:53.920 --> 38:00.800]  grosser than swinging I mean you're supposed to love this woman you're
[38:00.800 --> 38:06.800]  supposed to it's just very animalistic very primitive it ruins marriages you
[38:06.800 --> 38:11.680]  imagine these how evil it is in these families that have kids and a lot of
[38:11.680 --> 38:15.040]  people right now think I'm a wimp you know to them it's a macho tough thing to
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.800]  sit there and watch a bunch of men have sex with your wife no it'd be easy to go
[38:19.800 --> 38:27.240]  do that it's beyond caveman level it'd be easy to be an animal it'd be easy to go
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.760]  out and rob banks and kill people and rape women and you know get into all
[38:30.760 --> 38:36.800]  that stuff it'd be easy to turn over to the dark side but it destroys societies
[38:36.800 --> 38:42.960]  everything then falls apart and so it's all coming home to roost the dying
[38:42.960 --> 38:46.600]  court child kidnapping rings all of it the kidnappings exploding all over the
[38:46.600 --> 38:52.040]  U.S. now the country's gone now the only way we can get it back is to wake up to
[38:52.040 --> 38:59.000]  this evil and break the spell we're under break the transfer under I mean I
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.960]  read the army reports about how they rape children with battery acid objects
[39:02.960 --> 39:08.080]  in front of their parents this is this is confirmed and then oh Obama's gonna
[39:08.080 --> 39:14.520]  investigate camp x-ray camp x-ray in Guantanamo is the diversion camp it's
[39:14.520 --> 39:18.760]  the decoy camp the real camps are at black sites all over Europe and Central
[39:18.760 --> 39:31.120]  Asia and inside Iraq and they do have a real black site inside the inside the
[39:31.120 --> 39:36.080]  camp x-ray facility at Guantanamo as well where that stuff goes on see it's
[39:36.080 --> 39:39.640]  all part of theater they you know they'll give you their little event over
[39:39.640 --> 39:44.480]  here meanwhile they just like doing this so and not only do they like stealing
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.160]  the trillions they like having giant rape dungeons where they get to Jeffrey
[39:48.160 --> 39:52.840]  Dahmer little kids and then they make your hero Jack Bauer who tortures
[39:52.840 --> 39:56.280]  people's kids in front of their parents and then we all become psycho devils
[39:56.280 --> 39:59.920]  all right I said I'm taking calls and I'm out of control but see my brain is
[39:59.920 --> 40:07.040]  just storming with thousands of pieces of info like this Steve in Chicago Steve
[40:07.040 --> 40:13.680]  go ahead yes Alex you've got a lot of nerve you cut people off to talk about
[40:13.680 --> 40:18.280]  how to cut you off right now you know I'm cutting you off Steve I don't censor

[40:23.600 --> 40:27.360]  basically I'm covering up for racist Obama and you put out your little white
[40:27.360 --> 40:30.920]  pride signals and all that and I just don't have time for you I want to get
[40:30.920 --> 40:36.000]  to some new callers and so fine you call every day or the first person to call
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  call once a week you get one call a week Steve Lenny in New York go ahead Lenny
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.400]  Hey Alex what's up I heard on your show that someone wrote about a nine-month
[40:44.400 --> 40:48.160]  rule that an incoming president has nine months to stage a crisis to rally the
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.520]  people around him I don't know who wrote that was Milton Friedman was that
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.560]  did Clinton use that when he tried to bomb the World Trade Center the first
[40:57.560 --> 41:01.800]  time yes that was the first nine months well between that nine-month rule
[41:01.800 --> 41:05.800]  John Napolitano saying that the foreign clue is gonna hit hard in the fall and
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.520]  Henry Kissinger saying the guns are gonna be grabbed by September I think
[41:09.520 --> 41:12.760]  they're gonna move in the next few months so we'll be on red alert you know
[41:12.760 --> 41:18.880]  as great papers well that's the big news in the next hour yes everything's
[41:18.880 --> 41:23.200]  coming together they've got a stage of terror attack or a new war some something
[41:23.200 --> 41:27.480]  big probably gonna be the flu but they got a lot of different agendas going a
[41:27.480 --> 41:31.280]  lot of different balls in the air it's kind of like a quarterback who's got
[41:31.280 --> 41:35.760]  four balls in his hand and he throws them to four different people you know
[41:35.760 --> 41:40.720]  they cheat they don't play by the rules is one of those four gonna make it to the
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.920]  touchdown I don't know but I know that they got four different cards maybe more
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.880]  they can play and everything's coming together Lenny I couldn't agree anymore
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.400]  God bless you sir yeah that's what it comes down to let's go ahead and talk
[41:55.400 --> 42:00.520]  to John and Tennessee John go ahead oh Alex I just like to say appreciate your
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.520]  show and I'll hold you in the high sustained you're right up there with
[42:03.520 --> 42:08.160]  Robert Welch and some of the other great Patriots I just wondered if I could a
[42:08.160 --> 42:13.000]  friend of mine wrote a book in the 70s called the Rapture Cult and I would
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.320]  just invite all the listeners to go to Google and just key in the Rapture
[42:17.320 --> 42:21.960]  Cult and take a look at this book which I think that's our biggest problem Alex
[42:21.960 --> 42:26.680]  if so many people think well yes I know the whole country's going to hell but
[42:26.680 --> 42:32.800]  you know Jesus is coming next Tuesday and I think this book exposes that the
[42:32.800 --> 42:38.760]  conspiracy invented this religion as a new religion less than 100 years old I'm
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.080]  talking about premillennialism exactly it only got big in the last 120 years the
[42:44.080 --> 42:48.520]  Rockefeller Brothers Foundation publicly this is mainline history funded
[42:48.520 --> 42:52.720]  the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches to teach this
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.120]  they funded all the big groups that promote it and the whole Bible is about
[42:58.120 --> 43:03.560]  standing up to evil saying no standing up to the king and then they take Romans
[43:03.560 --> 43:07.920]  13 and say no you've got to submit to government do whatever it says and
[43:07.920 --> 43:14.800]  that's why now FEMA runs over 26,000 preachers that we know of secretly but
[43:14.800 --> 43:20.440]  now it's been declassified telling their flock to submit to government do what
[43:20.440 --> 43:25.960]  they say take the inoculations go to the FEMA camp and so all these
[43:25.960 --> 43:28.840]  Christians are saying yeah it's the end of the world I don't have to warn my
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.200]  neighbor or I'm gonna go ahead and give my little kids shots even though it's
[43:32.200 --> 43:35.760]  gonna make them have convulsions or whatever because it's of the Lord I
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.560]  should just trust in God and that's the opposite of what the Bible actually
[43:39.560 --> 43:44.320]  teaches yes that's the devil telling them to do that and if I could I just like
[43:44.320 --> 43:48.520]  to mention a quote by Robert Welch some I know you know who Robert Welch was Alex
[43:48.520 --> 43:54.640]  but in the 1960s Mr. Welch who was a had a Baptist background but he said the
[43:54.640 --> 44:02.400]  Communist only need 3% of the of anything to control it and he said right
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.880]  now this was in 62 I believe the only place where they have 3% is the
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.000]  Protestant clergy so and then you can see up in the 70s how Lindsay's book and
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.960]  all this stuff and they'll look at us now you know we've we nearly lost our
[44:16.960 --> 44:23.240]  Republic and I believe because the the population believes this nonsense that
[44:23.240 --> 44:27.320]  Jesus is their handyman and he's gonna solve all their problems while they
[44:27.320 --> 44:35.800]  sit on their ass so no I agree with you God go ahead Google and just key in the
[44:35.800 --> 44:40.400]  rapture cult and read this book you know you may not like it but you may like it
[44:40.400 --> 44:43.920]  but I guarantee you there's a lot of people that listen to you Alex and they
[44:43.920 --> 44:48.520]  agree with you but they've been mind-controlled by this conspiracy that
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.800]  oh gee you know I may be going against God's will if I try to stop you know what
[44:53.800 --> 45:00.040]  this could this evil one is revelations then talk about the saints you know
[45:00.040 --> 45:04.520]  standing up against the Antichrist and in the massive conversions and the waking
[45:04.520 --> 45:09.720]  up that's going to happen I mean the rapture cult had already taken hold by
[45:09.720 --> 45:15.720]  the 1930s and 40s and people all over submitted in China the Christians laid
[45:15.720 --> 45:21.960]  down to mail they use the Romans 13 rapture cult and they I mean under Romans
[45:21.960 --> 45:26.200]  13 not just the rapture cult the founding fathers are bad and I've had
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.600]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds if I probably had a thousand I mean I literally
[45:29.600 --> 45:35.400]  I get it every day year after year so it isn't the thousands saying I'm of the
[45:35.400 --> 45:39.320]  devil and so are the founding fathers because they stood up against King
[45:39.320 --> 45:44.640]  George III these people are in members of a cult and I agree with you the biggest
[45:44.640 --> 45:49.840]  thing holding us back is fake Christians not doing their job going along with
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.000]  corruption going along with evil and copping out I appreciate your call
[45:54.000 --> 46:00.680]  good to hear from you who's up next year Mark and Georgia you're on the air God
[46:00.680 --> 46:06.760]  bless I I got a lot of things I'll try to be concise I was thinking that humor is
[46:06.760 --> 46:12.920]  and it can get a message through that kind of gets around people like a
[46:12.920 --> 46:15.760]  quick of the short joke that makes a point you know how I know the dark does
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.720]  the bush is a good foreign again Christian the quote scripts are almost as
[46:20.720 --> 46:27.800]  well as Satan and listen I was thinking you do you do news is about ready to
[46:27.800 --> 46:31.680]  come online so rather than cursing the darkness by saying what YouTube is done
[46:31.680 --> 46:37.840]  and I agree but YouTube may be costing themselves a lot of traffic so let's
[46:37.840 --> 46:42.560]  promote you do news and when I get that disabusement project where basically
[46:42.560 --> 46:46.720]  lies only have power when people believe them and the thing is I'm I've
[46:46.720 --> 46:50.720]  studied out the manipulation tactics and I'm trying to explain to people the
[46:50.720 --> 46:55.000]  objective facts don't matter to a mind that's obstructed and if you understand
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.720]  how these tricks work you have a fighting chance of you know basically
[46:59.720 --> 47:03.120]  bringing the truth to life speaking of which I agree with your your assessment
[47:03.120 --> 47:06.440]  of the institutional church did you know that Keith Green is buried there in
[47:06.440 --> 47:12.400]  Texas and he zealously spoke out against the apostasy of the church and I've
[47:12.400 --> 47:15.680]  heard I read something that suggested that maybe it may be his the plane
[47:15.680 --> 47:19.200]  crashed it took the whole life of him and two of his kids he's buried in the
[47:19.200 --> 47:25.960]  Garden Valley Baptist Church cemetery around Lindale, Texas and his music I
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.960]  would just suggest I just want to encourage season according to taste I
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.360]  trust you're working on being a bit more gracious about people who have
[47:33.360 --> 47:38.200]  feedback and perhaps concerns and corrections for you and I appreciate that
[47:38.200 --> 47:42.360]  you're you're you're working on maintaining your composure and you recognize that
[47:42.360 --> 47:50.840]  lit in your anger do not sin and basically you know it's written basically
[47:50.840 --> 47:54.880]  you know that you want to basically you want you don't want the anger to
[47:54.880 --> 47:58.840]  contaminate your message where people dismiss what you're saying you know I
[47:58.840 --> 48:03.720]  went to my parents Methodist Church this weekend and that was actually what the
[48:03.720 --> 48:10.960]  pastor sermon was about and I that was actually yesterday and I actually agree
[48:10.960 --> 48:16.520]  with you the anger reaches out and and and gets a lot of people to wake up and
[48:16.520 --> 48:20.440]  you know Jesus himself got angry at the money changers I think there's a time
[48:20.440 --> 48:26.440]  for anger but I do think it should be more sparing because I tend to spin out
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.560]  I tend to just get so frustrated by it all that I'll stop working in the fields
[48:32.560 --> 48:37.760]  to plant seeds and just start screaming and that does lead to some things that
[48:37.760 --> 48:42.640]  are bad I appreciate your call so yes I agree with you but you know what I'm not
[48:42.640 --> 48:51.160]  perfect and I've been the most effective person out there and waking people up and
[48:51.160 --> 48:59.080]  I think that you can't argue with success but at the same time I'm not happy
[48:59.080 --> 49:03.760]  being purely angry with the system and I feel I have more discernment and I'm
[49:03.760 --> 49:10.400]  stronger when I actually am just saddened by the elite and their minions and the
[49:10.400 --> 49:17.360]  things they do because they're very unhappy people but I also then get angry
[49:17.360 --> 49:21.080]  at the crimes they commit and at the innocent people they hurt I mean every
[49:21.080 --> 49:24.960]  time I look into the eyes of innocent children not just mine but others I just
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.440]  see everything good in the world and everything loving and sweet and decent
[49:29.440 --> 49:38.640]  and I don't like how my mind has been contaminated with even having to study
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.120]  the New World Order and having to know all the evil things they do because
[49:43.120 --> 49:46.680]  you've got all this good going on on one hand all this beauty and love and
[49:46.680 --> 49:51.440]  innocence and you've got all this wickedness on the other that I'm forced
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.000]  to focus on and cover because we do have to expose it but I want to run to the
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.720]  hills I want to you know buy some shack in West Virginia or the Ozarks in
[50:02.720 --> 50:09.720]  Arkansas or and literally just run to the hills and just hide my head in the

[50:38.520 --> 50:44.600]  spiritual level this is like a spiritually guided thing it's like a cruise

[50:48.120 --> 50:52.440]  from it so the best way to face it down is to go head up against it with

[55:54.800 --> 55:58.960]  that our listeners put up they would scream and yell and laugh and say
[55:58.960 --> 56:03.640]  childish things so if you want to just call me spider-man or whatever and make

[56:32.800 --> 56:38.160]  said coming into the fall yeah that I feel that they're gonna have to pull
[56:38.160 --> 56:42.720]  something big and I've said all sorts of false provocations I've said I don't
[56:42.720 --> 56:47.080]  know what type it's going to be but I said yes I believe I said last Friday or
[56:47.080 --> 56:50.920]  was it Sunday that I think they're gonna pull something maybe next week and the
[56:50.920 --> 56:56.200]  next few weeks absolutely and and now we're discovering what it is New York
[56:56.200 --> 57:00.400]  Times Washington Times and others confirming that they're telling Union
[57:00.400 --> 57:05.800]  thugs to go out and attack people and and then people parse that and say I'm
[57:05.800 --> 57:10.600]  saying I'm against unions no I'm saying thugs from certain unions thugs of
[57:10.600 --> 57:15.280]  unions see so you're gonna play some anical games we can play them here too
[57:15.280 --> 57:19.840]  but yes yes you finally got me pinned down on something because I'm on the
[57:19.840 --> 57:23.400]  radio people always act like what's set on the radio is some secret that just
[57:23.400 --> 57:28.240]  they found and yes I'm saying I think they're gonna stage events maybe they're
[57:28.240 --> 57:31.320]  gonna let somebody out of a mental institution who goes to one of these
[57:31.320 --> 57:36.600]  town halls and shoots people maybe they're going to have a the cops bus
[57:36.600 --> 57:40.600]  somebody with a with a pipe bomb in a parking lot they've done this stuff
[57:40.600 --> 57:45.000]  before in the mid 1990s the feds when the same thing was happening bombed
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.920]  Oklahoma City as a pretext we have DHS reports demonizing in the Fed
[57:49.920 --> 57:56.400]  protesters demonizing gun owners demonizing veterans and yes I think
[57:56.400 --> 58:00.680]  they're gonna try to demonize people who are shutting down these town halls and
[58:00.680 --> 58:04.640]  the reason they're getting shut down is the politicians run off the stage when
[58:04.640 --> 58:08.000]  everybody starts booing them it's the majority the vast majority booing them
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.760]  what is it you don't understand that I told people six months ago that coming
[58:12.760 --> 58:16.200]  up in the summer you were gonna see a mass awakening and that the people were
[58:16.200 --> 58:19.520]  gonna start taking over public events did you not see that prediction come
[58:19.520 --> 58:26.280]  through Jack I disagree with you about the timing not the fire itself look my

[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:42.600]  films are posted there in super high quality as well I'm continuing with open
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:49.960]  phones people disagree they agree from the line I'm saying that they're gonna
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:54.960]  have to stage something to shut down people demonstrating and protesting at
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:58.880]  these town hall meetings and what they're doing is they're having thugs come out
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.640]  and beat people up and then the national news says that it's the anti-Obama
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:08.240]  people that are doing it when in every case and we've got these all posted up
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:13.600]  on info wars.com and prismplanet.com it's the Obama people beating people up
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:18.600]  they're the ones creating acorn and city year and compulsory service
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.640]  brigades they're the ones with federal money out paying youth to do this and
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:28.040]  paying the unions to have people do this when Obama is selling out the union
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:33.480]  people but if you're a janitorial union I guess you're for Obama because that's
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:36.480]  about the only jobs will be left in America though there won't be many
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:43.520]  businesses for you to clean you know I see the comments up on the websites on
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:46.880]  info wars and prismplanet the comments on our YouTube videos about you don't
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:49.920]  like unions you work for big corporations you work for oil companies you
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:55.920]  work for this or that I don't own any stocks any bonds zero I work for Alex
[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:01.720]  Jones period I see these comments about there's not even a bill for you to
[1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:04.880]  critique on the health care there's not even a bill that's a talking point
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:08.920]  definitely I see that on the news I see that in the comments I see that on the
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:12.960]  street I heard that yesterday from people drinking the Kool-Aid yeah there's
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:17.000]  three different versions and all three have all the horrible sections in them I
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:23.920]  mean you people it's like Obama saying there's no anti-gun bills that's a lie
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:33.480]  we've read the bills on air I mean folks you're being suckered and I know Bush
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:38.720]  was bad but just because Bush was bad doesn't mean Obama's good I mean isn't
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:44.280]  that an elementary equation and this last guy I mean I get on air and I
[1:02:44.280 --> 1:02:48.280]  cover facts and information but when I get up on air and I say my gut tells me
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:51.640]  that politically they've got a stage something because Obama is dropping
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:58.800]  several approval points a day he is in free fall everybody who's got half a
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:01.800]  brain realizes this I don't know exactly what they're gonna do I just kept
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:06.360]  repeating it in the first hour they may use the flu they're certainly gearing up
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:09.280]  for that they're saying they're gonna forcibly inoculate and have troops
[1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:13.600]  locked down cities and then if they don't do that in the fall or in the
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:18.720]  winter I will be accused of saying that they were gonna lock down the cities and
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:25.240]  have forced inoculations I'm playing the CNN Fox ABC news pieces and you've all
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:28.680]  seen them we've played them but even if you don't listen to show regularly it's
[1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:32.400]  all over the news I catch it all the time and hardly watch TV so it must be
[1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:36.840]  everywhere saying they're gonna forcibly inoculate everybody and lock down the
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:41.240]  cities now if we're able to get the word out and get the public to
[1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:44.160]  understand they don't have to take the shot they probably won't get away with
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.520]  this time just like in 2002 they had model state health emergency powers act
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:54.800]  they ordered 14 million first responders to take it and the 14 first
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:59.640]  responders 14 million said no so it didn't happen and then people said Alex
[1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:04.720]  you said they were gonna make people take smallpox you're a liar no I said the
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:08.920]  government is saying right here in the news they are and we've got to warn
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:13.400]  people they don't have to so they fail well now they're back trying to force
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.920]  people to take the shots but then the straw man attackers come on and say
[1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:24.600]  Alex said they were gonna make us take flu shots and and and they didn't so he's
[1:04:24.600 --> 1:04:30.240]  a liar well okay if you want to be in delusional a la land that's fine they are
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:33.320]  telling public school kids going back to school in a week and a half that they
[1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.640]  got to take the shot that's just Google school children tell told they got to
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:42.320]  take flu shot you'll get hundreds of articles I mean what planet are you
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:45.680]  living on I understand people out there don't want to face what I'm saying and
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:49.760]  what I'm putting out I understand it's scary look I got family to I got
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:55.160]  children too but I'm covering the facts here you know Northcom is saying they're
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:59.600]  gonna put drips on the streets so we better get the word out and stop it
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:03.920]  hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this
[1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:07.520]  question do you really know what's in your tap water in a recent study
[1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:11.880]  conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:15.640]  chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:19.480]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:24.080]  system diseases now what are you going to do about it the Ecoloblu atmospheric

[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:07.240]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:13.760]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:22.720]  when I said last Friday that I have never had more concern for the country
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:32.680]  and the world I'm in it I am so concerned in my gut in my spirit in my
[1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:38.720]  intellect that I can hardly even be on the radio right now I mean my my
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:52.440]  instincts are just off the charts and the last time I had a disturbance in my
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:59.000]  psyche of this magnitude was two months before 9-11 and I went on air and I
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.800]  said they're probably gonna blow up the World Trade Center blaming on their
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:04.920]  asset is some have been lodging and they're gonna do it the next two months
[1:09:04.920 --> 1:09:10.920]  and it happened in two months and I did radio show after radio show I mean in
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:14.160]  the six months before that I did show after show saying they're gonna attack
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:18.600]  they're gonna stage terror because I saw the army in the news saying get ready
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:22.200]  terrorists are gonna attack we're gonna take your rights away when this happens
[1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:26.400]  for your own safety we're gonna set up north com we're gonna get ready your
[1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:33.040]  liberties for your safety and I saw conditioning on TV saying here's been
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:38.360]  laden he's gonna get you he's blowing up the Buddhist you know two thousand
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:46.600]  year-old temples in Afghanistan he's bad we you know I was like and I just had
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.800]  all these pieces of evidence and what happens is my intellect my brain your
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.400]  subconscious is hundreds of times conservatively and that's not just
[1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:59.640]  psychologist or psychiatrist that's that's neurologist from studies believe
[1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:04.880]  it's depending on the person hundreds of times stronger than your conscious
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:11.200]  intellect your con you know your your your your what people think of as your
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:16.120]  sixth sense or your hunch or your feeling or really good police detectives
[1:10:16.120 --> 1:10:20.800]  or FBI detectives in history people that can solve cases or nobody else can you
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:25.080]  know they look at the info they just go over it they kind of think about it for
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:31.480]  a few days a few weeks all that is is the very powerful subconscious mind
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.800]  collating data and researching and what happens is the more you study the more
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:41.120]  you get into a certain topic it's just like if you study baseball for 20 years
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:44.320]  you're going to know everything about baseball you're gonna remember all these
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:47.760]  facts and statistics you're gonna be able to really guess with a lot of
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:57.000]  proficiency who's gonna end up winning certain events that year a lot of these
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.080]  bookmakers you have in Las Vegas they should really be Pentagon strategist
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:05.640]  but they fell into a different line of work and what I do is I study the New
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:09.600]  World Order I study history I study their pathology I study how they work and
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:16.240]  then possible scenarios kind of pop out of the computer God gave me and right
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:20.000]  now I'm seeing so many horrible scenarios in front of me and I see evidence
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.920]  the enemies moving and I see evidence they're preconditioning and I see that
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:31.200]  they're in trouble right now and so I realize they don't have any option that
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:40.160]  I can see but staging terror attacks and then my gut is off the chart I mean I
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:43.880]  could barely be on the radio right now ladies and gentlemen I keep having to
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:49.800]  catch my breath and and it's it's it's it's not the kind of catch my breath
[1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:54.600]  like an anxiety attack it's more of a catch my breath like the moment of
[1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:59.440]  history we're at and them and the time we're entering is just got my heart
[1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:08.000]  going here I mean I got chills right now and I'm also amazed at how evil these
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.280]  people are I mean I can't believe they go through with the stuff they do and
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:17.480]  that they could be this intelligent and still do this level of evil I mean I
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:22.720]  have knowledge about humanity and knowledge about our species and knowledge
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:28.160]  about what we're really meant to do what we're designed for which anybody which
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:35.480]  any old villager in south in southern Mexico or in on the seacoast of Greece
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:44.480]  or in some old man in Tokyo Japan will has it's just the knowledge of humans
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:49.600]  and what we are and how we operate and I just sit there and marvel in love of
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:55.000]  the species and in love of innocence and goodness and then I look at the evil the
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.920]  evil ones they have all this knowledge and they have made the decision to hurt
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:05.440]  innocence and the decision to dumb down the mass of their fellow homo sapiens
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:10.520]  sapiens so they have an advantage over them and to make us evil like they are
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:16.240]  so that we're weak and to play us off against each other and hundreds of
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.120]  government textbooks no exaggeration I haven't counted them up I have two stacks
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:24.840]  at my house Aaron's got three stacks back there and a bunch he took home he
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:28.920]  leaves here at like two in the morning every night and reads to like 5 a.m. then
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:33.800]  comes in like a zombie at noon just hunt it's got to be hundreds of books total
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:36.920]  we've bought over the years but probably 50 the last few months all about how
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.320]  they're going to break up the family how they're going to sterilize us how
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:45.800]  they're going to create a new species how they're playing God and these people
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:14:00.800]  these people really know what they're doing they really understand what's
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:08.200]  happening and they are cold-bloodedly wrecking our species I mean they could
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:14.600]  have easily directed the society to have people clean-cut happy empowered into
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:20.960]  science into research into literature into art into Shakespeare and built the
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:28.520]  culture up classical music and they brag about this they have consciously
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:34.080]  dumbed everybody down made us be shield made us animalistic and stupid and then
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:40.120]  you go out and talk to humanity they are wrecked and then you talk to people
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:45.000]  who are well educated and somewhat well often have high IQs they're still
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:51.840]  scared of any information and have been operantly conditioned to not want to be
[1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:58.280]  involved or informed so they're under fear and it's just such a crime against
[1:14:58.280 --> 1:15:05.400]  the species against life forms against the universe to do what they've done and
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:12.000]  I'm a product of my environment to a great extent I'm not perfect I'm gonna
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:16.400]  tell you right now but I can at least look at what I could have become on the
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:28.960]  dark side and it didn't pretty but I made a decision to stand up for goodness and
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:32.080]  I think there's a passage somewhere in the Bible about the beginning of
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:38.800]  knowledge is sorrow like let's try to search that and see if we have it the
[1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:43.880]  beginning of knowledge is sorrow or with knowledge comes great sorrow but
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:52.480]  sorrow isn't even a bad thing it's almost as if pain and sorrow is the
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:58.240]  evidence of the fact that you are a human who is growing because I also have
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:05.040]  incredible energy and incredible love of life and light and goodness and I
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:10.200]  realize that that's the natural human condition that we always have the bad
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:14.800]  in us but we're always reaching for the good but instead the establishments
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:18.960]  figured out how to make us reach for the darkness and then people start going
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:22.760]  down the path of darkness and they think well if I just get into more darkness
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:28.400]  I'll be happy or if I just immerse myself into evil that somehow I'll become
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:34.040]  fulfilled and what happens is like a black hole they become more and more
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:40.920]  unhappy more and more angry more and more energized almost a gravitational pull
[1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:49.040]  of evil it's just it's just horrifying to watch it and the profile the signature
[1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:57.200]  the wavelength the signal that I see forming is going to make Stalin's
[1:16:57.200 --> 1:17:00.840]  bloodletting and Lenin's bloodletting and Hitler's bloodletting and Mao's
[1:17:00.840 --> 1:17:09.240]  bloodletting those guys all together killed over 250 million people whole
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:14.760]  pot governments as best I can tell have killed about 500 million the last 100
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:24.600]  years or so but just those I mentioned over 200 million well I mean they say
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:29.840]  they want to kill 75% of us in the White House science ours own government
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:33.760]  policy book I mean I've got stacks of them I can't even read them all I can't
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:42.200]  even go over all the evil clothes I can't even it just doesn't have to be
[1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:49.640]  this way we we don't have to have this happen and and and even if you believe
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:58.160]  that it can't be changed even if you believe it can't be changed you at least
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:03.400]  got to fight it or you've lost your humanity there's a quote forget who
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:11.680]  said it I actually voiced it for the film I want to say it was frost it was
[1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:20.360]  frost the guy that wrote the poem about the woods are lovely dark and deep but
[1:18:20.360 --> 1:18:27.880]  I have miles to go before I sleep about those that that don't resist evil
[1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:34.000]  and corruption command it to be done and so I I'm not even fighting evil
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:40.920]  because I'm moral and I'm good it's not a conscious thing I'm doing it because
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:47.640]  it's who I am I can't control myself I am pulled inexorably with more energy and
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:53.040]  more discernment and and just an overwhelming the word is a possession
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:59.960]  because that has bad connotations a a complete surrender to resisting the
[1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:07.200]  New World Order because all of my humanity my very fabric cries out
[1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:19.720]  against this tyranny you can't be on the right path and not resist evil if you
[1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:24.640]  don't have a burning compulsion like some people have a compulsion to use
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:29.720]  drugs or some people have a compulsion to have sex and I'm a healthy person I
[1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:33.440]  think women look great I love my wife but I don't even so much think about that
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:36.600]  anymore I don't know how to explain it it's like everything is being turned over
[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:44.120]  to resisting the tyranny it is a total driving dominating force and I don't know
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:52.080]  how people out there can claim your good and and not have a burning desire to
[1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:57.720]  stand up against thugs and bullies and scum all right we'll come back to

[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:05.880]  in the New World Order's war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:10.520]  the spear we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:16.520]  powerful just as strong just as well funded the Obama deception completely

[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:37.280]  that's the false flag is the media saying it's racist if you disagree with
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:41.120]  Obama then all these dumb down people really believe that people that don't
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:45.280]  want cap and trade and open borders and socialized government health care and
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:50.840]  gun controller racist and then it causes street fights and riots maybe that's the
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:55.560]  false flag I don't know and the globalists do inventive things but
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:59.040]  we're taking your calls right now let's talk to Andy in Florida Andy you're on
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:07.480]  the air hey Alex hi hey I just want to tell you I'm a new fan and new listener
[1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:11.880]  and love your show and website thank you sir good to have you on board what's on
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:17.520]  your mind well I feel like an enormous you know cloud has been lifted and I
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:21.360]  love you for what you've made me aware of and I hate you for what you've been
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:26.920]  made me aware of I know the feeling yeah just ask some of my friends that I
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:34.320]  keep emailing stories so a couple different things number one is the
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:42.240]  story that just recently came out and I'm surprised I sent an email to your
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:48.920]  website that suggests that Obama and Congress should not let the polls guide
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:55.320]  their decisions and this was a story written in Inside Politics Daily and I
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:02.640]  emailed it that basically is saying that you know the president and the
[1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:10.400]  government should not really listen to any polls or public opinion because the
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:14.600]  public opinion is fickle and contradictory now what's the headline on that
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:18.600]  article because what's the headline on that because I want to see it that that's
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:29.240]  a very sophisticated point and very hard for me to explain but in essence that is
[1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:34.560]  true George Washington did some things that were very unpopular and then it
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:40.640]  was born out later that it was the right thing to do not going against the
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:45.680]  British with the French during his first administration because the country was
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:53.600]  barely on its feet and it had promised to be neutral in its treaty but they were
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:57.880]  burning stuff out front the White House and they were going crazy and you know
[1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:00.560]  really trying to overthrow the government and French operatives were
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:05.960]  inside the US trying to overthrow things and he didn't then a lot of other
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:09.480]  people got mad at him because he wouldn't crack down on them he kind of
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:12.440]  took a thing of saying I'm doing the right thing I don't care if this is
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:18.680]  unpopular now what he was doing was constitutional though and it was
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:24.000]  following his pledge it's different with Obama because all he's done is lied
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.200]  about his pledges so now his approval rating is plunged because people are
[1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:37.280]  angry at him lying and betraying them and the people in on every issue just so
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:42.880]  happen to support what the Constitution and Bill of Rights show so the federal
[1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:48.880]  government on every issue of wars and NAFTA and cat and cap and trade and
[1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:54.040]  health care and gun control the government's going in the opposite
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:58.600]  direction of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the people are going
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:03.640]  with the Bill of Rights and Constitution so and it's generally like that in
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:08.600]  history because what's in the Bill of Rights the Constitution is good I mean
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:11.640]  people can say it's it's not perfect but it's better than anything else anybody
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:17.080]  ever created these men were geniuses top philosophers I mean blow away the Greek
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:20.400]  and Roman philosophers and I've read them all now maybe it's because it's in
[1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:23.320]  the English tongue and originally written in that I understand it better
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:29.520]  and not in the Latin but the issue is these were amazing people cut above the
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:34.200]  cut above the Krim dollar Krim the Krim dollar Krim of the Krim dollar Krim
[1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:40.160]  and they knew what they were doing and so but see that's a spin like Obama is
[1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:45.520]  moral Obama sticking to his guns doing what he knows is best see first he goes
[1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:51.600]  with the mob rule democracy idea of hey a 51% wanted tell the 49 get out of the
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:55.840]  way your astroturf we're gonna tread on you and if you come out with a don't
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:28:58.920]  tread on me we're gonna punch you in the nose and call you the n-word and
[1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:04.440]  they're all yay you know I mean that's basically what he's saying now that he
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:07.680]  realizes that it's clear that everybody's turning against him they're
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:12.120]  like well we're gonna stand and do what we know is best even if you all hate us
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:16.480]  so now he's trying to pull a fake George Washington which actually if you
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:19.400]  actually like a true leader and actually stuck with something people might
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:24.520]  actually like but only if he was doing something good he's doing something bad
[1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:26.480]  I mean is that what you're getting at here
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:32.120]  yeah no absolutely I think it's also propaganda that's being created now to
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:37.680]  discount the various protest and and town hall meetings that have been
[1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:41.960]  happening it's basically saying well yeah this is kind of serious but you know
[1:29:41.960 --> 1:29:46.840]  our leader shouldn't really you know listen anybody no great point various
[1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:51.440]  good point you've made appreciate the call to the back more calls we're on

[1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:48.080]  revolution of burning cities the globalists are gonna want to make a
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:52.400]  revolution of burning cities so they can demonize the revolution and not make
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:56.520]  it about ideas they're geared up they're ready for it it's what they want and
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:00.480]  they know that we're smart and not gonna give them what they want so they're
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:04.600]  gonna do it themselves and they've already been caught doing that you know
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:07.080]  we said they were gonna go out and beat people up at these events they've done
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:11.200]  it and it's not like my predictions are hard to make I mean we know how these
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:16.640]  people operate be like if I took you to Africa and said now watch the Nile River
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:22.560]  you know where these salt crocodiles are watch that baby gazelle walk over to
[1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:26.440]  the edge that saltwater crocodile is gonna launch out of the water and grab
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:30.920]  it and drag it in and then we sit there for five hours in the blind people
[1:34:30.920 --> 1:34:33.880]  actually go to Africa I know folks that have done this you know the wildlife
[1:34:33.880 --> 1:34:38.480]  watching you can see you know people stake out the waterholes because you're
[1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:42.760]  gonna see action all day long the animals gotta have water they go down to
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:47.720]  the waterhole and tie lions are hiding in the bushes and in the grass and
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:52.680]  crocodiles are hiding in the water and you'll see hippos run over and kill
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:57.280]  crocodiles and hippos the meanest thing out there you know a hippopotamus kills
[1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:01.480]  more people every year in Africa than cobras people all think they're nice and
[1:35:01.480 --> 1:35:04.960]  sweet at the zoo throwing food in their mouth San Antonio zoo you can feed them
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.280]  but you notice they're down below you they look real sweet those big giant
[1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:13.160]  spiked teeth you notice the zoo people think of a hippo as having pegged teeth
[1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:18.880]  because they chop them off they got giant fangs I mean elephants run from
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.480]  hippos man there's nothing just that's nothing meaner than the friendly
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:29.160]  hippopotamus but you know that's another example of images people are so scared
[1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:33.760]  of sharks but they might kill 10 people a year maybe maybe but people aren't
[1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:38.400]  scared of automobiles that kill millions worldwide every year people aren't scared
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:47.080]  of the White House science is armed the White House science are because he's a
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:51.160]  nice little quiet professor type who writes government policy books on how
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:54.720]  to drug the water supply and how to chem trail you and make your crops die and
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:58.600]  how to take your children at birth and how to have forced abortions how to
[1:35:58.600 --> 1:36:03.320]  grab women and kill their babies it's all public all been in the associated
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:08.240]  press not just me telling you about it all how to sterilize you all how to get
[1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:12.240]  rid of at least 75% of the world people say I thought it was 80 different
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:18.040]  government documents UN says 80 club of Rome says 90 Prince Philip says 90 Ted
[1:36:18.040 --> 1:36:23.920]  Turner says 90 Professor Pianca says 90 his graduate students say all kill all
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.480]  humans so but you know that he's lower he only says kill 75% so I mean I guess
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:32.640]  he is kind of a nice guy that isn't scary to people he's kind of like a
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:37.680]  hippopotamus the most deadly thing out there but nobody cares a little
[1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:42.520]  hippopotamus over here but then I go out and put some white clown makeup on
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:47.440]  I'm now the 20-foot cobra when I did the Joker last week that scared people I
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.480]  talked to one of my mom's friends and she saw it and she said it scared her and
[1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:57.400]  I'm gonna talk about that later in the next hour when I walked up to Austin
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:02.440]  cops as a stunt to get people to do the contest to put up the Obama posters
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:09.320]  to test flash mob a peaceful flash mob viral marketing of the info war I'll
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:14.560]  explain why I did it it's really elementary and the cops look like eight
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:19.640]  year-old boys that are scared of the thunder it looked like my six-year-old
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:23.400]  someone something scares him they went look just like little boys they went and
[1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:27.640]  started in a little bit of its on tape cuz Rob do got the I jumped out in the
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:32.800]  camera wheel around and they saw the Joker going hello officers and they
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:36.680]  because they'd seen Hollywood movies the Joker isn't real but in their
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:41.000]  subconscious it was because they saw it and they start stepping back and getting
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:46.400]  and but but but it wasn't like a scared like you know going it was like little
[1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:54.640]  kids kind of like like like childlike fear and then one I'm recognized me and
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:58.560]  smiled on them but the other two were still didn't know I was and he was like
[1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:04.080]  it's alright I think I'm kind of lucky that the guy with the highest rank knew
[1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.560]  who I was even in clown makeup people later so that was so dangerous or I'm
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:11.800]  lucky I didn't get tased I mean what I just got out in a clown outfit and said
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:16.160]  hello officers in a parking lot 50 feet away and walked over with my hands like
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:23.440]  this hi but they were scared until one I'm went and said oh it's alright I said
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:28.080]  something and then you know because he was smiling at me knew who I was but see
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:32.280]  it you can have a nice little beard and be friendly grab me one of those clown
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:36.480]  noses off the table out there and we're going to archangel thanks you know it's
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:40.520]  like I'll put sunglasses on suddenly everybody would say oh Alex thinks he's
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:45.640]  cool and people would stop on YouTube and watch this video more than they would
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:50.760]  regularly just because I'm wearing sunglasses and they'll comment he looks
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:56.480]  like a cop or he looks like CIA or he thinks he's tough or he thinks he's
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:01.960]  cool see it's all about coloration it's all about camouflage and so these
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:06.840]  hardcore criminals wear suits and ties and are trained to talk slow and calm
[1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:12.000]  and soothing and they go to corporate seminars on how to do it and so it soothes
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:19.720]  the whole public but then I put on some clown makeup and it scares the daylights
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:23.400]  out of people and I said that in a piece but I didn't realize how much it would
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:28.480]  scare people but then if I do this the image is I'm a clown now everything I'm
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:36.280]  saying doesn't make any sense it's stupid it's silly and sometimes government
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:39.160]  does that when you really catch him doing something bad then they'll act
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:49.560]  clowny or they'll put out a fake oh what's it called controversy a fake
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:53.240]  controversy about oh they're mistress or something you know I mean they get caught
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:58.080]  stealing a million bucks from the Treasury or all that's been paid trips or
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:02.080]  something suddenly you'll see some other story about somebody having sex with
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:10.360]  their assistants or whatever that's done to divert you off the big issue so that's
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:17.200]  the kind of stuff they do instead of how I look or what type of shirt I'm wearing
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:23.120]  or what type of clown knows I have or do I have sunglasses this is all just
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:26.920]  cosmetic I'm gonna explain this more next hour and I knew we get a lot of
[1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:32.120]  attention because the Joker's this archetypal image but number one video on
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:38.680]  YouTube it got a hundred thousand views in an hour Saturday and then they
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:44.200]  removed it off the front page and banned a bunch of the other videos a hundred
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:49.840]  thousand views an hour it was like 50,000 views and then it was it was it was
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:53.120]  about 45,000 views and then it was a hundred and forty thousand views an
[1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:56.720]  hour later you go to the Alex Jones channel and see it's like a hundred and
[1:40:56.720 --> 1:41:02.600]  fifty something thousand views right now that you know they clearly froze it or
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:06.240]  removed it off all the lists so people wouldn't see it but then they erased a
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:11.680]  bunch of our other videos where I was calm cool and collected talking about
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:15.680]  how Republicans are being moved off the stage and so are Democrats and how it's
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:19.240]  nonpartisan and how they want to make Republicans and Democrats fight with
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:23.920]  each other instead of coming together to audit the Fed abolish the Fed in the
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:29.040]  New World Order and those two videos were also on the front page with tens of
[1:41:29.040 --> 1:41:33.360]  thousands of hits just that day I didn't screenshot it before they were
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:36.960]  taken down but I think one had fifty something thousand views and one thirty
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:40.480]  something thousand views and they were climbing quickly you know they just got
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:44.200]  noticed and gone viral and YouTube has algorithms they admit where they can see
[1:41:44.200 --> 1:41:47.680]  that and they just said kill them you know you can't stop that boom kill them
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:50.920]  and they just killed those videos where I was sitting there real nice going
[1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:57.720]  listen everybody Republicans are being protested to and we can all go out and
[1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:05.160]  put up signs that say Obama fascism Obama info wars dot com and they're
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:08.880]  really scared of this art type of image of Obama as the Joker because it helps
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:12.600]  people see him in a different light and realize it's all just a Hollywood image
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:18.480]  this hits something in the subconscious and so now from Ireland to England to
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:26.560]  Germany to Russia San Antonio Los Angeles Arkansas I mean last night I
[1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:31.320]  spent like 20 minutes going through YouTube under Alex Joker contest or
[1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:37.200]  Alex Jones Joker and I saw scores of videos of people doing the contest
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:42.600]  they're putting them up everywhere and you know we tell folks do it in legal
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:45.240]  areas where they allow you to put those signs up a lot of times most towns do
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:48.200]  most cities do and they have areas where people flyer and then that's where you
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:57.880]  should do it and I've gotten two reports I saw one comment that I was emailed and
[1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:01.520]  then archangel who gives us a lot of really great tips that have proven to be
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:08.160]  bona fide bona fide in the past said that he went to FedEx Kinko store 0525 I
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.380]  want curtain him on a blurb on this or one of the Watson's in Greenville
[1:43:12.380 --> 1:43:19.040]  Pennsylvania just refused to make this into a poster on vinyl yard sign for me
[1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:23.760]  Sean told me that his higher-ups stated they refused to print so-called slanderous
[1:43:23.760 --> 1:43:28.640]  signs for either side so see that's how it works now just saying somebody's a
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:32.440]  joker you're not allowed to do that what again you can't talk about about
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:36.240]  public figures the corporations are enforcing this chilling effect what a
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:43.000]  bunch of baloney so much for freedom of speech in America with a K please call
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:47.040]  me for more info I'm going to call all over Pittsburgh to see if anyone will
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.040]  print this for me I'm angry I talked to Judy who said that to email the image
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:57.680]  for pricing I just called him and they refused so multiple places now and then
[1:43:57.680 --> 1:44:06.240]  I got another one here saying the same thing so well I mean I've seen these
[1:44:06.240 --> 1:44:12.760]  other reports where people go in to staples and they refuse to print up
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:16.120]  info wars in fact that was a story about two years ago I remember covering it
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:20.160]  because the guy sent us the you know they even gave it to him in writing saying
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:25.920]  no we don't promote terrorism we don't promote hate info wars calm couldn't and
[1:44:25.920 --> 1:44:31.440]  then now people are on YouTube because I did some videos that have also gone
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:37.800]  viral two of them saying look my videos are being removed for racism the videos
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:41.440]  that were moved weren't even about race but then I said even if I would have been
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:47.160]  talking about racial issues that's your free speech and then I have the articles
[1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:51.000]  in fact pull up the one about Obama speech police shut down top YouTube
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:56.120]  videos we have a screenshot in there of what he of what what YouTube emailed us
[1:44:56.120 --> 1:44:59.520]  or actually on their account interface for the Alex Jones channel we now run
[1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:03.080]  that channel with Dave used to be a fan site it's run by the fan that started it
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:06.840]  but I got into the interface with Aaron up here late Saturday night we're up
[1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:10.800]  here working so we could get on this quickly and we pulled it up and it said
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:17.520]  yeah this community violation racism and YouTube explained to us that in their
[1:45:17.520 --> 1:45:21.680]  rules that you have people just say something's racist I mean I eat it could
[1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:28.880]  be a bucket of junior rail bottles floating around and somebody could reach
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:37.160]  in and go ice cold banned racist I can put a clown nose on racist I can walk out
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:45.240]  and say it's a pretty day racist they explained that you could show video of a
[1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:49.720]  guy catching a fish a white guy racist black guy catching a fish racist you
[1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:54.720]  could show birds in a in a nest racist you could show the Capitol building
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:46:02.040]  racist this is the new democracy where if 51% of course this isn't really a
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:07.440]  democracy anybody complains you're gone now of course it's all selectively
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:12.360]  enforced you go file false complaints people say they're doing this on Barack
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:16.240]  Obama's presidential channel saying it's racist and his attorney general
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:19.560]  actually has tried to create race and they are invoking in the White House is
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:24.840]  saying it's racism and the Tea Party's a racism that is race baiting they're
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:29.120]  injecting race where it's not there you're the president all presidents get
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:33.040]  attacked that's why they wanted him I told people they didn't want him for
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:38.440]  racial reconciliation it was about you are against him you're a racist I wish
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:42.520]  we had a black president that would revoke all the gun laws and abolish the
[1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:46.400]  Federal Reserve and he could do that with his leadership with the Congress man
[1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:51.200]  I would just kiss a black president's feet but a black president did that would
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:55.960]  get assassinated so what a white president but again they know people are
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:47:01.080]  sick of color but they inject it that's why you always hear the NAACP saying we
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:05.720]  want to talk about race we want to more discussions on race so we just can't
[1:47:05.720 --> 1:47:10.920]  live together and be that we're all the same folks but they want to make us look
[1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:16.040]  at the differences and so I refuse to give it to the religion of racism that
[1:47:16.040 --> 1:47:20.400]  you know all last week they said these posters are racist and the White House
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:24.140]  said it and all these I mean I've got all these clips from national TV we
[1:47:24.140 --> 1:47:28.440]  posted them where they go this Obama sign is racist period they had a
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:31.600]  Washington Post writer on there going he gave no evidence he just said they're
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:36.520]  racist and the lady said but the Village Voice had the cover of Bush as a
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:40.760]  vampire and this magazine had Bush as a joker well he's clearly not racist he's
[1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:45.920]  white the guy actually it's total mind control he actually says that it's
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:50.800]  impossible for it to be racist if you're white racism's only for black people and
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:58.920]  that Obama's black and so you can't criticize him I mean next if Tiger Woods
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:04.120]  misses a putt are and somebody says oh bad shot for Tiger are they gonna go up
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:09.000]  that's a racist I mean of a black quarterback drops the ball and they
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:13.360]  say oh yeah he lost all racist I guess actually that's what Limbaugh got in
[1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:17.160]  trouble for was actually saying that I mean I don't understand this it's like
[1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:24.040]  a religion it's like you can't say but again meanwhile the government's arrest
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:27.780]  in the black people in many cases for no reason put them in prison put an extra
[1:48:27.780 --> 1:48:31.000]  fluoride their water that's been proven in studies about the EPA on admitting it
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.880]  we don't know why the fluorides five times higher in minority areas because
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:37.400]  they added in certain junction pipes at a higher level
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:43.080]  eugenics folks but again the real races act like liberals and so they play
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:47.440]  everybody off against each other while they're carrying out their ops against
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:53.880]  the people of color and everybody else for that matter so they want to get
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:56.560]  everybody fighting with each other and make this a racial issue let's bring up
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:01.520]  Archangel Archangel have you finally found somebody in Pennsylvania they'll
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:09.920]  copy a Obama Joker poster or is it just they're so mind-controlled America that
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:12.080]  you can't make a poster of him as the Joker
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:16.880]  no sir good afternoon I did find a Kinkos a FedEx Kinkos a matter of fact
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:22.960]  downtown Pittsburgh with the manager Doug Forte who I spoke to about my problem
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:27.040]  with the green tree store it's not Greenville excuse me it's green tree and
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:31.360]  uh mentioned it to him and he said I'll be more than happy to print them and make
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:35.440]  them for me he's printed them and doing it right now he said he would mention to
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.720]  his manager to talk to the other store manager about what they had told me and
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:45.960]  he said that they've printed much more remember when when which is actually
[1:49:45.960 --> 1:49:49.160]  British owned the Queen actually owns part of the stock Burger King no joke
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:54.720]  told Burger King owners they'd be sued if they put anti-global warming messages
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:59.000]  so all the Burger Kings I mean a large portion of them who were privately owned
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:02.880]  it turned out were mainly intelligent people that knew it was a fraud because
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:07.200]  they run a business you know they're not stupid and so hundreds and hundreds of
[1:50:07.200 --> 1:50:11.560]  stores then put it up nationwide well more than hundreds one owner owned over
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:15.160]  a hundred I remember the first one in Tennessee only owned a few they threatened
[1:50:15.160 --> 1:50:18.720]  him so a whole bunch of other Burger Kings did it the issue is they're trying
[1:50:18.720 --> 1:50:23.200]  to bully free speech in America I mean if you own a gas station you can put
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:28.560]  whatever message you want up there right I mean you can't I mean you would think
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:31.960]  that King goes effects are big company you would think that person could walk
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:35.760]  in and within reasons like you know will you print this for me but for them to
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:40.360]  try to censor you know my freedom of speech or to say we will not print that
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:44.600]  because we find it offensive now he said basically I originally called Judy on

[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.260]  it's like it actually increases a predator's enjoyment if the person's

[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:11.760]  back to archangel finishing up archangel so you're so you're talking to the
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:18.480]  kinko's people and you list the store kinko store 0 5 2 5 and what they just
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:21.960]  said you don't show the president the bad light not in America so they wouldn't
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:25.560]  take your money well they refused to print it and I asked I originally talked
[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:30.320]  to Judy email them the stuff from your website and waited to respond and then
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:34.560]  called back and spoke to Sean and Sean said well you know we can't do that and
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:38.800]  I said why I said well we don't do anything political from either side left
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:43.720]  to right and basically went to a short spiel and I said but that's wrong you
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:47.920]  can't do that you're in business the message is political activity of any
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:54.120]  type is evil right why I figured the store up there maybe they're full of
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:58.840]  bots I don't know but I was like well this this this won't work this won't
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.040]  stand I'm gonna call your corporate office and then I figure well wait a
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:06.400]  minute I'll try a few other stores so the next store I called which was 0 5 1
[1:57:06.400 --> 1:57:11.120]  6 which is downtown Pittsburgh on Grand Street and I got this dog guy I said
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:14.840]  Doug I just had a problem with these people in green tree it's really you
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:17.920]  know sort of make me angry there they refused to print it he said what are you

[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:25.800]  a problem with this I'll make it whatever you want as big as you want as
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:31.400]  many as you want so I said great so I I sent him you know all the information
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:35.000]  what I wanted they're working on it right now he said he would talk to his
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:39.080]  manager to speak to the manager up at the green tree store however I'm still
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:42.920]  waiting to get a contact well I would imagine these are Obama bots but we've
[1:57:42.920 --> 1:57:48.200]  also seen staples and a few other places refused to print info wars.com
[1:57:48.200 --> 1:57:52.560]  like that's some kind of terror word but more and more have you seen the
[1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:59.680]  White House saying Limbaugh's on thin ice and better watch it I mean I don't
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:02.600]  like Rush Limbaugh I mean let's get that straight I think he's a fake
[1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:06.240]  conservative but I'm now gonna defend Rush Limbaugh just like I defend Michael
[1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:09.920]  Savage when they tried to ban him flying to England I mean these people mean
[1:58:09.920 --> 1:58:15.160]  business folks they're banning my videos as racist and there's nothing about race
[1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:20.320]  in them. Now this is a horrible situation it's only getting worse they've ramped
[1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:25.000]  this up exponentially. Yeah well let's talk about more on the other side I'll
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:28.600]  take some more calls and get into this country on the edge of revolution they're
[1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:34.560]  saying now the definition of racism is not agreeing with Obama they're saying
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:38.840]  that I mean now you see political correctness they really want this country
[1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:44.280]  to be like the Soviet Union. America's number one stories for independent

[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:27.600]  All right more your calls coming up and in the shower having a breakdown my
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:32.160]  analysis of why we're going into a real revolution I can confirm to you this is
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:38.720]  it we hold destiny in our hands a bunch of other news I've gotten to taking your
[2:00:38.720 --> 2:00:42.480]  calls seeing what directions those take us in real fast finishing up archangel
[2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:46.320]  listener in Pennsylvania sent us a lot of good tips over the years he's taking
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:51.160]  part in the Obama Joker poster contest and the reason I chose the Obama Joker
[2:00:51.160 --> 2:00:55.400]  to do a contest with is the media said it was racist and bad and that we
[2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:58.600]  shouldn't be doing it when there's nothing to do with race it's saying
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:04.360]  he's an arch criminal people did this with George Bush and so that's why I
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:07.040]  chose it was because they were trying to restrict it
[2:01:07.040 --> 2:01:11.640]  restrict its first amendment and so I said oh you don't like this well we're
[2:01:11.640 --> 2:01:17.120]  gonna do it more okay it's not that we have something with the Joker it's that
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:21.440]  this was a big national issue and so we're now showing you where the first
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.080]  amendment's gone where I'm being attacked for doing this contest my videos are
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:30.080]  being erased this guy can't get him made at Kinko's this is the type of stuff
[2:01:30.080 --> 2:01:34.240]  we're talking about no bombers on TV saying report people that criticize me
[2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:39.040]  to the White House citizen spy groups and the press secretary saying limbaugh
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:43.400]  might get in trouble he's on thin ice he better watch it and they got the
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:48.200]  fairness doctrine introduced in three bills go ahead archangel let your handle
[2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:53.560]  out there on the web great handle by the way you made the great point I mean
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:58.280]  they are on afterburners right now trying to say it's wrong to criticize
[2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:03.080]  their agenda that isn't gonna work so I see more people in the streets it
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:06.520]  didn't go in a way this is only the beginning I see this getting really
[2:02:06.520 --> 2:02:10.360]  nasty because they're gonna make it nasty they don't have a choice but to
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:14.480]  make it nasty archangel and we don't have a choice but to try to take the high
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:18.520]  road and expose them for what they're doing with the internet while we've
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:24.760]  still got it well I agree wholeheartedly but the thing is with with the things
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:29.240]  that they've done and they continue to do they're escalating this to where at
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:33.760]  some point it's gonna hit a flashpoint and then I can't guarantee that all
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:38.800]  bets won't be off but what worries me the most is a lot of Americans don't
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:42.440]  know some are waking up some are not where either my whole community is
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:47.960]  mostly either mind-numb zombies or robots and I'm like the only but the
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:51.520]  freak show here on the quarter my house looks like the United Nations I have
[2:02:51.520 --> 2:02:55.720]  like 30 flags hanging from the Katzden flag and Liberty and all all the
[2:02:55.720 --> 2:02:59.680]  patriotic flags I had the news media up here while you finally flags because
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:04.160]  it's my right and all Americans start you start doing that because we're the
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:08.320]  majority I don't care what color you are how old you are even what your
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:11.920]  politics are you better stand up for free speech and against the new world
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:15.680]  order and look they knew this all along they knew Obama was gonna come in
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:19.760]  lie about everything he said he was gonna do everybody was gonna get angry
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:23.600]  with him a certain percentage of diehard people will drink the Kool-Aid and
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:27.440]  won't care and they plan on making us all fight with each other while the
[2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:32.720]  bankers steal everything Obama is the false flag that just came to me last
[2:03:32.720 --> 2:03:37.280]  night he is the false flag you know we talked about how he wanted to divide and
[2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:42.680]  how he was gonna be used for that but he is the false flag he is meant to be
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:49.520]  destroyed in the polls he is meant to to become a diversion himself and even if
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:53.480]  I sit here and try to say don't make it about Obama he's gonna make it about him
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:59.600]  that's his job well they're coming after us this is not a drill at this point I
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:06.760]  think that when pigs fly and NWO flew and all this martial law talk all the
[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:11.400]  stuff they are getting ready for the big move against us I believe in every way
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:15.680]  shape and form collapse the market close the banks martial law oh swine
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:19.880]  flu is gonna get it take these poison killer shots the list is endless and
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:23.480]  they're coming after us now and when they open the door and let all the stuff
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:26.960]  out of Pandora's box I don't know what we're gonna do we have a right to live
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:30.600]  we have a right to be left alone that's all we want we want to live in peace and

[2:08:24.200 --> 2:08:28.320]  forgot to get to it swine flu's worst-case scenario paranoia or
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:35.640]  preparedness and Fox News quotes us like we're credible so that's what I mean
[2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:39.800]  this is starting to get twilight zone level in addition to planning mass
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:43.480]  graves and crematoriums operating around the clock governments are planning to
[2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:47.240]  implement martial law in response to a pandemic Curtin M. O. wrote for info
[2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:51.000]  wars dot com which has been tracking disturbing developments and swine flu
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:55.280]  preparedness Nemo appointed to report in the daily telegraph that referred to the
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:08:59.840]  British government's emergency plans for mass graves inflatable mortuaries 24
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:09.880]  hour cremations and express funerals yeah his stories point to the they also
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:14.280]  point to the Rocky Mountain news to the actual documents we got from the state
[2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:18.160]  of New York I mean we don't just come in here I mean Fox News itself is saying
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:21.320]  the troops are getting ready with Northcom to lock down US cities and
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:26.760]  forcibly inoculate Helga who I've known for about 10 years who lived in Austin
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:32.120]  she's German move back to Germany she called the office this morning and said
[2:09:32.120 --> 2:09:37.560]  that it was on mainline national German news radio that they're growing the
[2:09:37.560 --> 2:09:42.960]  swine flu in cancer viruses and I've seen some of that in reports of one
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:47.040]  company developing it over there ladies and gentlemen I mean you just you just
[2:09:47.040 --> 2:09:51.920]  get just it's just it's insane now again if we expose this that there's no law
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:55.000]  you got to take the shot that it's a fraud and if they can't get their own
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  first responders to take it they're not gonna get away with us in the fall and
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:04.640]  then I'm gonna be blamed for making up that the army was gonna be on the
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:09.440]  streets and making up they were gonna inoculate us I'm reporting what's on the
[2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:15.880]  news but that's how the common tell pro operates you know I report ABC news goes
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:20.280]  on and says a missile's been fired at the US from Russia I go on and say ABC
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:23.840]  news reported this I don't know if it's true come back in 10 minutes later and
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:28.960]  say okay ABC news said it was a scud on a trajectory but nowhere near the US and
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:34.640]  then it becomes I made up a missile everybody knows on record that they're
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:40.360]  announcing all over TV I've played here and we could play here clip after clip
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:47.520]  played one last week Fox CNN ABC all over the news in fact just Google it army
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:56.120]  army to aid during swine flu or army to quarantine cities you know I saw this
[2:10:56.120 --> 2:11:01.640]  big attack piece on me saying Jones lies and says foreign troops involved in
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:07.480]  NLEO 9 and then it shows no proof that I lied the FEMA press release said
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:13.520]  foreign troops were involved in the drill we covered it and said it's regular
[2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:19.960]  operating procedure I've shot video of foreign troops in drills see this the
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:25.240]  the the ad hominem or straw men attacks against me are all counting on you being
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:32.360]  ignorant they're all counting on you not checking the facts I've laid out I mean
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:35.320]  look he just went to Mexico and they said they're gonna bring in their North
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:41.640]  American Union through crises like the flu that was in the 1997 Banff Canada
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:46.000]  meeting that we cover in my film in game that they would use flu here it is
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:52.040]  North American Union for flu reasons I mean it never ends the covers they use
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:56.200]  so my point is you know they did try to order 14 million first responders to
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:12:00.760]  take smallpox shots and remember bunch of them started dying so they said no and
[2:12:00.760 --> 2:12:04.800]  then Tommy Thompson wouldn't take it they had a health and human services we
[2:12:04.800 --> 2:12:10.000]  can say no but when we have a victory the enemy then says oh where's the
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:16.320]  martial law see this is how they operate meanwhile look at the tyranny look at
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:19.360]  the loss of freedom look at all the announcements of North com to be on the
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:23.720]  streets of America and real military checkpoints looks at you're making some
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:27.400]  great points I'm gonna go to John Matthew Sean Ronnie and Cody quickly but
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:31.600]  archangel caller from Pennsylvania who couldn't get the Obama contest posters
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:35.680]  printed he had to shop around you were finishing up a point you're right the
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:43.360]  enemy is gonna press and push and drill and hammer until they do get people to
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:46.800]  actually fight back that's why they're having homeland security drills with the
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:51.120]  army in Tennessee and Missouri and Texas notice the heartland they're really
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:56.880]  worried about us where malicious attack the army who were quote running flu
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:13:01.480]  checkpoints so see they know there's gonna be families that when the
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:04.360]  government tries to take their kids are just gonna flip out and shoot the troops
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:09.000]  it's guaranteed gonna happen I'm not saying it's a good thing it's a bad thing
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.120]  people try to not do that or avoid that but what are you gonna do when they're
[2:13:14.120 --> 2:13:17.680]  grabbing your kids I mean I broke the clergy response teams a year and a half
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:21.240]  before it got declassified and what were they doing training you to take your
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:25.360]  kids break up your families I mean they really plan on this and see New
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:29.520]  Orleans was a beta test now they want to do bigger beta test and then a bigger
[2:13:29.520 --> 2:13:35.800]  operation comes after that but but they are planning to get people into
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:40.160]  firefights with police and military and I just tell the police military they're
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:43.680]  releasing the flu they're staging this there's no doubt we've had a bunch of
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:47.200]  neurologists and epidemiologists on all of them but one say it's clearly
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:52.920]  manufactured and Nyman says oh no it's you know I'm like well what about this
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:56.400]  what about that he never has answers for it you know he's saying it's this big
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:00.320]  doom huge thing and they're having their flu season in the other hemisphere and
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:04.320]  less than 2,000 people died when normally it's hundreds of thousands I
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:08.560]  mean look I'm hoping it's all just hype to get you to take vaccines and then God
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:14.400]  knows what's in those what's your take on all this Archangel I believe that part
[2:14:14.400 --> 2:14:19.560]  of it is a false flag and part of it is just to force people to take the shots
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:24.220]  we definitely know that the shot exactly to set the precedent to set the
[2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:28.640]  precedent to get people to take the shots go ahead now they're also I mean
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:32.500]  look they're taking our rights and freedoms every day so they're hitting
[2:14:32.500 --> 2:14:38.040]  us on all fronts okay they're gonna do this all at one time like they're
[2:14:38.040 --> 2:14:43.920]  ramping it up I'd say August September the the beginning of October at the
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:50.280]  first all this is going to come to pass what they want to do to us and look we
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:53.920]  have to put aside our partisan differences as you say as Americans of
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:58.120]  all races agree the color we must make this stand together now we're fighting
[2:14:58.120 --> 2:15:01.720]  for our lives we're fighting for our children we're fighting for our country
[2:15:01.720 --> 2:15:07.080]  we're fighting for our very immortal souls against evil men and women in power
[2:15:07.080 --> 2:15:12.880]  in government and the corporate you know structures in in Baxter pharmaceuticals
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:17.960]  and in all these places we have to make this in now we have to make it united we
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:22.080]  all can't be Alex Jones we all can't be Archangel but what we can be is the
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:27.240]  best men and women we can be and do our part in this fight to save ourselves and
[2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:32.080]  our country we must do it now this is I keep telling people this is not a drill
[2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:37.920]  if we wait what will what will happen if we wait they will take everything we
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:41.560]  have are you gonna wait till they knock at your door we want your guns are you
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:46.000]  gonna wait till they knock at the door take this shot no we must tell them no
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.680]  we must be immediately oppose them I agree in fact I think I should make a
[2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:55.480]  one sheet with like 10 bullet points in big black ink but then people won't
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:15:59.200]  really pay attention to it maybe it goes with a bigger poster of one image
[2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:03.240]  saying read this with an arrow below it pointing to the next piece of paper you
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:09.040]  put under it that gives like 10 bullet points about the swine flu vaccine and
[2:16:09.040 --> 2:16:13.360]  we should have a campaign to get people to not take the shot Archangel keep up
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:17.160]  the great work and God bless you sir thank you sir you bet we appreciate you
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:20.840]  now I'm gonna go to your calls but I wanted to play this clip from C-Span
[2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:27.440]  yesterday and Paul Watson has this from the Sunday edition of the Washington
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:32.800]  Journal and they have the Politico writer on and the ladies go and look I'm
[2:16:32.800 --> 2:16:38.760]  not partisan and she lays out exactly what all these people are saying now
[2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:41.640]  again it'd be fine if it was partisan people out not wanting this that's
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:45.480]  they're right but it's not it's both Republicans and Democrats being moved
[2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:49.040]  off the stage and I've now discovered it's not just my videos that are
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:52.960]  exposing that this is nonpartisan it's other videos exposing that it's
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:56.560]  nonpartisan that are being taken down all over the web because the
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:01.240]  establishment is scared folks if the American people get together and stop
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:04.000]  fighting over race and religion all this and start fighting against the
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:08.720]  Federal Reserve and the corrupt bankers and figure out how we're being robbed
[2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:13.200]  and raped financially it's over folks it's a very small criminal group that
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:17.320]  owns both parties the two parties are sick of their bosses and their masters
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:21.480]  blackmailing them and all this they want to shake them off too if we ever start
[2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:26.240]  thinking about the bankers this is what Gandhi said to the Indians it was
[2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:30.760]  something like 300 million Indians during his time over a billion now and he
[2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:34.400]  was like I forget the exact ratio it was something in some areas like one
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:38.920]  brit for every thousand Indians but in some areas for every couple hundred and
[2:17:38.920 --> 2:17:43.160]  he's like look at you they play you off against each other that's why we can't
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:47.200]  get rid of them so he traveled the country for 20 years saying believe in
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:50.780]  yourself don't fight with your neighbors you know Hindu and Muslim stop
[2:17:50.780 --> 2:17:55.200]  killing each other stop letting them manipulate you stop they're playing you
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:18:00.320]  off against each other that's how the United States took over the
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:05.360]  Native Americans the natives would come and say help me kill my neighbors give
[2:18:05.360 --> 2:18:09.320]  me part of their land you get the other half and then five years later the
[2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:15.360]  unified Anglos it's all tribal they would then knock off the tribe that they'd
[2:18:15.360 --> 2:18:20.040]  help knock off the other tribe we've got to get sophisticated enough to
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:25.440]  understand this let's go ahead and start the club here she is our last call comes
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:29.640]  from Leah in Manchester New Hampshire on our line for independence go ahead
[2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:34.480]  hi yeah I just wanted to clarify a few things about these manufactured
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:39.760]  angered crowds I've never been politically active in my life I've
[2:18:39.760 --> 2:18:45.320]  never done anything like go to a protest ever I started going to protest these
[2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:49.720]  tea parties back on the 4th of July and the reason that you're seeing the
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:54.280]  numbers grow and swell and become bigger and bigger it's not only because of the
[2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:58.920]  health care legislation but like you said earlier all these massive bills
[2:18:58.920 --> 2:19:03.920]  thousands of pages long that are passed with almost no debate no time for us to
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:08.120]  see what's in it in direct contraversion of what was promised about
[2:19:08.120 --> 2:19:12.240]  transparency and a new era of we're going to know what we're doing in advance I
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:18.160]  see I see politicians admit on TV that they can't read it and they can't
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:22.200]  understand it because of its complexity lawyers who are writing these bills say
[2:19:22.200 --> 2:19:26.240]  they need lawyers to tell them what's in the bill now when I watch the news
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:31.880]  people stand here and tell me that I am a member of a hired mob and that I've
[2:19:31.880 --> 2:19:36.600]  been called up by the Republican Party they only wish they could have done
[2:19:36.600 --> 2:19:42.240]  something like this I've never been contacted by any organized group this
[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:48.240]  is an organic movement and when people stand there and lie to me about what I
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:53.640]  know is going on how can I trust them when they tell me it's gonna save money
[2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:57.720]  when the Congressional Budget Office says it isn't we'll be right back we'll
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:02.400]  be right back your calls coming up tons of news studies have shown that many
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:06.040]  people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good
[2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:10.240]  health with so many places to choose from deciding where and what to buy can be a

[2:24:00.880 --> 2:24:16.760]  all right let's finish up of this lady calling in c-span saying it perfectly
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:22.080]  we've got it posted an article that Paul Watson wrote detailing the fact that
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:26.360]  these are organic and the media is now having to start to admit that and they're
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:29.280]  having to start to admit because it's backfiring on them they don't want to
[2:24:29.280 --> 2:24:33.160]  tell the truth they've been trying to imply it's Republicans beating people up
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:37.080]  and the problem is it's the people getting arrested are the ones attacking
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:43.680]  the quote tea party people and the tea party were kind of a nucleus and Glenn
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:48.000]  Beck and others tried to hijack those but I've been to these events the
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:54.160]  Republicans get booed off the stage to and that's the message I've been putting
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:25:01.280]  out that's getting removed off YouTube they do not like it they are not happy
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:06.880]  because they need to play Republican and Democrat off against each other so we
[2:25:06.880 --> 2:25:13.960]  don't look at the elite and go after them go ahead and finish her up
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:28.600]  in party they only wish they could have done something like this I've never been
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:33.800]  going on how can I trust them when they tell me it's going to save money when
[2:25:33.800 --> 2:25:37.200]  the congressional budget office says it isn't that it's going to cover everybody
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:40.280]  when the congressional budget office says it isn't that it's going to let me
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:45.160]  keep my my health care when common sense tells you that that's not what's going
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:49.000]  to be the end result of this when the government ends up providing all the
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:53.280]  health care which the man who wrote the bill in the beginning says
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:59.120]  watch it Jacob hacker who wrote this says that in time and president Obama said
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:04.360]  it we will all be swallowed up in this government plan when people lie to us we
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:07.240]  don't trust them when they give us platitudes about what's in the bill
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:12.040]  Leah are you planning to are there any town halls planned in your area and your
[2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:16.760]  neck of the woods my my my congressmen are afraid now they won't even come out
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:20.680]  and meet us face to face they want to do some phony telephone thing so that we
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:24.720]  can't judge their facial expressions we can't say with a follow-up question I'm
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:28.880]  sorry that didn't answer my question could you please and you know yes people
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:33.560]  are getting angry that doesn't mean it's fake it means it's real and by the way
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:37.600]  about the caller who says this is all racial the only person I've seen that's
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:42.440]  been attacked physically attacked as a black man who was attacked by fdi you
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:46.520]  and he says they were black so I'm getting tired of the race card I'm
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:49.960]  getting tired of the live I'm getting tired of the media not telling us what's
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:53.760]  in these bills but giving us a bunch of Republicans say this and Democrats say
[2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:59.200]  that I don't care we'll leave it there thanks for your call yeah definitely make
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:04.000]  that woman a congressperson seat but that can't happen we've got to only make
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:09.800]  government criminals and people on the payroll part of it and they're scared to
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:13.480]  death of us getting together they are scared to death of these facts coming
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:18.640]  out they are scared to death and this is unbelievable I told you a few weeks ago
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:22.800]  I said watch they're gonna cancel these meetings and now scores of articles
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:27.080]  about how they're canceling for security and why cuz your thugs then beat
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:30.920]  people up in that backfire and see first the White House put out memos in the
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:34.760]  New York Times and Washington Times saying go out and get in their face and
[2:27:34.760 --> 2:27:38.880]  provide cover for our Congress people and if they hit you hit them twice as hard
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:45.600]  but nobody was hitting them so they went out and beat people up and now then and
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:48.320]  not just the black guy they're beating up women you name it the videos are all
[2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:53.040]  out there it's a cool place I'm coming up and so that's backfire so they just
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:56.240]  said that's it we cancel the meetings and they're canceling from New York New
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:02.840]  Jersey Florida Missouri Indiana Texas California the articles are pouring in

[2:33:01.600 --> 2:33:20.520]  coming up
[2:33:20.520 --> 2:33:26.520]  I'm going to play the video of the police brutally attacking all scientists
[2:33:26.520 --> 2:33:31.200]  patient and I see these reports every few days where an autistic person or
[2:33:31.200 --> 2:33:36.880]  retarded person is beaten or killed by police they've had it a couple times in
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:41.840]  Austin where mentally retarded men are out the police pull up and say come here
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:45.560]  and they go you know I mean I've actually seen on the news some of the
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:49.960]  footage they'll go oh and then start walking away and the cop just draws
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:54.120]  down and shoots them right in the back and then remember Chicago police two
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:58.480]  weeks ago said yeah if you run from us we're gonna shoot you in the back that
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:03.640]  was CBS news and they said yeah that's our policy I mean there's it isn't all
[2:34:03.640 --> 2:34:07.320]  about you being an authority the only person you should be shooting the back
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:13.040]  is if somebody's got a hostage or if somebody's got a weapon or if somebody's
[2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:17.240]  been I think if somebody starts driving recklessly ramming into other cars and
[2:34:17.240 --> 2:34:20.520]  these car chases I think the police ought to open up on them because that's a
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:25.720]  deadly weapon but you get some retarded guy going no starts running from the
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:31.200]  cops and they just get down on one knee and you know it's just it's oh I mean
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:38.960]  that is crazy that is cold-blooded killing just out of control but I mean
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:43.840]  just the wanting to use force and I could see wanting to use some force on
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:48.520]  some big guy with tattoos all over I'm going come on cop let's go then that's
[2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:51.880]  when you're supposed to get your warrior instinct up and and and want to fight
[2:34:51.880 --> 2:34:55.680]  somebody you're not supposed to want to fight a retarded you know 20 year old
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:34:58.320]  you're not supposed to want to fight an autistic person you're not supposed to
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.840]  want to fight an 87 year old your instinct as a man or as a woman is to
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:06.680]  want to fight people that are actually a threat to you I don't know how to I
[2:35:06.680 --> 2:35:11.240]  don't understand it I mean I can't even get aggressive with somebody who isn't
[2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:17.160]  powerful I mean I'm not even wired that way I mean I don't understand this
[2:35:17.160 --> 2:35:22.240]  system I don't understand these people because the cops I see tend to enjoy like
[2:35:22.240 --> 2:35:25.560]  all these pro-lifers I've got videos of them if they're sitting down on the
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:29.360]  sidewalk the cops legally in federal court torture them worse than Abu
[2:35:29.360 --> 2:35:33.760]  Ghraib or or Camp X-ray they take num chucks and twist their arms till they
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:37.640]  break with the bones sticking out we've shown the video YouTube bans that by the
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:42.600]  way oh you can show the heading video because that's what they want to show
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:47.200]  what you show the and again how do they get whole police departments in LA and
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:52.920]  it's couple other states but to break men and women's arms and laugh about it
[2:35:52.920 --> 2:35:55.600]  and then the cops get excited after they're beating them and pull out their
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:01.440]  billy clubs after they see blood I don't know you're a different type of
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:06.000]  animals I mean what makes me tick is different from what makes you tick and I
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:09.360]  know there are a lot of police that have you know good instincts and and and do
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:13.640]  actually want to go after bad guys I just I don't understand it I mean I've
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:18.120]  seen I don't go to 6th Street anymore cuz 10 11 years ago I would go down there
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:21.920]  just to film Halloween videos you know of what people thought politically asking
[2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:26.560]  questions and I'd see cops just beat people up for no reason and slam women's
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:30.640]  heads in the ground and and and I started seeing shaved head cops black gloves
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:35.560]  looking for a fight and going you got a problem punk and I was just like I gotta
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:39.600]  get out of here so and I and I really went down there to begin with but the
[2:36:39.600 --> 2:36:43.440]  only time I go to 6th Street now is when I get invited by TV station or radio
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:48.160]  station PBS of all people wanted me on locally for Austin TV about South by
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:51.880]  Southwest this year some radio stations wanted me down there and I went down
[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:58.880]  there but I you know I keep my eyes down and just keep going because the cops are
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:02.880]  looking for trouble I mean I was actually looking around for a bar I was
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:06.120]  supposed to go in for an interview and a nice cop walks over and goes you looking
[2:37:06.120 --> 2:37:10.200]  for something yes it's right over there just about about six six down that way
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:14.200]  well I said thank you officer you know you bet have a great day that was a
[2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:18.400]  person who wants honor on the badge that's a person who wants to build up
[2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:23.760]  his position as a peace officer and work with the community not the guys that
[2:37:23.760 --> 2:37:28.480]  are just like bouncers who decided to become cops who got an attitude I'll
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:32.000]  tell you another reason I don't go down to the bar district of Austin is there
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:36.360]  are some good restaurants down there is it was bouncers too I remember in
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:40.040]  college taking dates down there and you'd be walking through and just showing
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:44.720]  your ID and the and a big guy would go feeling tough tonight huh punk how about
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:48.400]  you make a move and I'd see him do it to me and other people and I wouldn't even
[2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:54.920]  get mad I would like is this a joke you know but these are guys on steroids who
[2:37:54.920 --> 2:38:00.400]  can't get women or even if they can they can't perform and and they've got
[2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:05.720]  attitudes and and and they're in a position where legally they can beat
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:09.500]  you up and get away with it so they're looking for a fight meanwhile the
[2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:13.720]  bankers are ripping him off the system scamming him all the nerds see this is
[2:38:13.720 --> 2:38:18.440]  the nerds rule the globalists are nerds into science and facts and studying how
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:21.960]  humans operate and how to manipulate us and they're all oh you're a big
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:27.920]  bouncer oh I control whole mercenary armies see that's their attitude to you
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:32.160]  the big bouncer and you work for them you're just the thug they use they laugh
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:36.000]  at you I mean these guys like the White House
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:40.880]  science are I I know their mindset I've read their writings when they see the
[2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:45.520]  thugs that protect them they think hello good morning oh you you're drinking
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:49.520]  your fluoride and taking your shots in her brain damage and and and they look
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:53.000]  at you like they're examining you and it's a little it's a dominant power
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:57.480]  trip see the bouncer likes to act tough at the bar not all bouncers I'm seeing
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:02.120]  you know these thug ones just like a thug cop wants to act that way not all
[2:39:02.120 --> 2:39:08.480]  cops but the bad ones people always do strawman attacks and say I hate all
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:13.040]  unions I hate all cops I hate all bouncers no I don't hate all jail guards
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:16.640]  I'm talking about the sado masochistic ones that are into being thugs and
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:27.920]  pressing on the nerve of raw power and the point I wanted to make is the
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:34.480]  scientific dictators they're into acting very homely and very weak and you know
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:40.560]  very imper palpatine oh I just want to help and that's what they're doing and
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:45.520]  and and they just enjoy though I look at they love going into crowds of people
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:49.560]  and seeing everyone they're drugging everyone they're diseases everyone they're
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:53.080]  in planning with cancer viruses everyone they're sterilizing it's just a
[2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:58.000]  quiet sort of enjoyment and they even write about this about the satisfaction
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:03.280]  helping the earth hmm so all you tough guys need to get tough and actually
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:07.640]  instead acting tough at bars you know and tough at the club or tough at work
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:12.160]  why don't you get tough for your family and humanity and become real men why
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:16.960]  don't you cops that like beating people up become real men see because the system
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:23.920]  you love that's giving you this petty power is is is is punking you and this
[2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:28.240]  show is about not being pumped you understand it's about really being a
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:31.560]  human being really being straight and strong does that mean we have all the
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:36.000]  answers no but we got guts and guts is enough and we're taking action and

[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:09.760]  knowledgeable is wimpy well you don't know about history and real warriors do
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:15.120]  you you are in a sick arrested development culture get out of it alright I

[2:41:40.400 --> 2:41:43.720]  just want to tell you about uh I ran into a freemason he told me to read some
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:47.960]  books and he said like to become a freeman not that I wanted to become a
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:51.520]  freemason or anything he said read uh William Cooper's to Behold the Pell
[2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:57.880]  Horse I think it was Defroding America by Ralph Emerson and I just want to let
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:05.480]  you know you know Ralph Rush Limbaugh he told America that William Cooper was
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:09.960]  dangerous and he was one of the dangerous radio hosts I just want you to be
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:16.000]  careful man love you all right buddy thank you look I'm not the business of
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:24.080]  getting in fights we William Cooper but people tried to set him up against me
[2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:27.240]  because he did some jealousy broadcast and most people that attacked me aren't
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:32.400]  urban agents they're mad and he started seeing that I was more popular than him
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:38.520]  I never heard his radio show never heard it and you go back to my early TV shows
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:43.040]  you know I was citing G. Edward Griffin Ron Paul those were the people if you see
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:47.440]  those first shows I was pretty close to a mainline Republican kind of like
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:53.080]  Republicans today that are starting to get into Ron Paul that was about the
[2:42:53.080 --> 2:42:56.400]  level I was at I mean I knew about the Federal Reserve I knew about global
[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:00.280]  banks I knew about monopoly capitalism I knew socialism and fascism were
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:05.280]  controlled by the banks I'd read Gary Allen's you know who woke me up it's
[2:43:05.280 --> 2:43:10.880]  Gary Allen it's Bob Chapman Bob Chapman you'll publish that book he paid for it
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:17.280]  that's who woke me up and so I wasn't into UFOs I've never covered UFOs that's
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:23.000]  not me he was a UFO oligist that's what he did and he was on WBCQ that no one
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:27.840]  can hear in Texas and by the time after I'd interviewed him trying to help him
[2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:31.160]  out when I heard the IRS was after him the age of the Internet had begun people
[2:43:31.160 --> 2:43:34.760]  said hey you better know who this guy is here are audio recordings of him
[2:43:34.760 --> 2:43:39.960]  attacking you so I was sent cassette tapes that were recorded off short way
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:43.280]  that I could barely understand so I didn't I didn't really listen to much of
[2:43:43.280 --> 2:43:50.280]  it I popped one in and he said that I'm a transvestite that wears a ruby
[2:43:50.280 --> 2:43:56.280]  nipple rings and I thought it was a joke and then I finally read about the
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:44:00.360]  behold a pale horse I've been mailed I've been mailed a lot of them and it was
[2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:05.880]  it said that Jesus was sacrificed by aliens and there were holograms and
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:13.880]  flying saucer submarines and I mean I couldn't get through it and so I'm
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:18.720]  forced to just explain to people that William Cooper could attack me all he
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:25.080]  wanted to and that's fine it was all just because Genesis put my show on at
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:28.480]  night he flipped out is now since then I've heard a lot of it and thought I was
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:32.960]  going up against him I had never heard him I don't have time to listen to
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:36.560]  cassette tapes people send me one time driving up to Waco to build the Memorial
[2:44:36.560 --> 2:44:41.080]  Church for those that died I popped it in the cassette in my Tahoe and was just
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:48.520]  like you know I mean those recordings are out there you know he said I was at
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:53.400]  a public event being given an award dressed as a transvestite and Jesus is
[2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:59.280]  an alien I mean this was just Jesus was being filmed with aliens holograms I
[2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:06.080]  mean just lunatic crazy I mean just lunatic nuts I had no idea and I was
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:08.440]  talking to Jason Burmese about this the other night he goes yeah he went and
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:14.200]  printed it up actually that get Jason's here and I cleaned off the desk get him
[2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:18.160]  to print the passages where aliens filmed Jesus being crucified by the other
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:28.000]  aliens I mean folks you know if that it's just so crazy to me that that's
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:34.360]  what Cointel Pro used to try to discredit me is that guy who everybody I
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:41.840]  talked to said that you would call him up and he would just start screaming and
[2:45:41.840 --> 2:45:49.360]  cussing at you and he was well known for that and just so out of his mind that I
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:57.320]  don't think he was an agent though I think he was a complete lunatic and you
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:46:03.400]  know I cover real issues things I can prove documented facts I can cover and
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:10.760]  I don't like speaking ill of the dead but from the grave that guy attacks me and
[2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:15.520]  I mean have people really looked I mean it's like that there's some what's his
[2:46:15.520 --> 2:46:19.280]  name I say I haven't seen much of it but I've got YouTube hooked up to a TV set
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:22.760]  in my garage and for about a week or two I was addicted to watching videos
[2:46:22.760 --> 2:46:29.480]  attacking me so I could run and and watch him and laugh but there's a guy
[2:46:29.480 --> 2:46:36.560]  man I forget his name he writes books about the Vatican running everything and
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:40.360]  I've exposed the Vatican about other for a world government and New World Order and
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:44.560]  all this but no he says I'm a Vatican assassin agent it'll pop my head in a
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:48.760]  minute and I'm this super evil guy and all this stuff with no evidence no proof
[2:46:48.760 --> 2:46:58.880]  and then I actually went and watched him and he said that Catholic priests doing
[2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:08.080]  black magic fire atom bombs and that they drop them out of flying saucers on
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:13.320]  Hiroshima and Nagasaki I mean this is the most howling at the moon lunatic
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:17.560]  stuff and then I get emails the few times I've mentioned that saying yes it's
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:23.040]  true and you're an evil devil and you know how to create a bombs I mean these
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:31.200]  people are and they made it folks I know how to go and I mean you know it's
[2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:37.560]  crazy anyways I said I take your calls it's just we're going on down side
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:44.280]  issues now I just get sad for people that spend the majority of their time
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:53.480]  believing these people and look either than against Jewish people I even have
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:57.120]  Jewish friends were really nice great people went to college Jewish friends I
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:48:00.760]  had an Iraqi friend in high school in college to you know Iraqis are nice
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:08.040]  people had black friends have black friends but they photo shop my head and
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:17.640]  say it's real on somebody's body and then put me next to a Jewish lady and put
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:23.560]  me in a photo with rabbis and say it's real and people say respond to this this
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:29.200]  is your Jewish wedding it's not true I mean you know I can't spend all day
[2:48:29.200 --> 2:48:34.240]  responding to this look I'm not in to holograms of Jesus being crucified I'm
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:39.040]  not into flying submarines I'm not into Chuba Converse and I'm not bashing
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:45.880]  people that aren't they can be into that all day but I am who I am I am when I
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:53.520]  say I am and I'm faithful to everybody 110% I'm the real deal just like you're
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:58.360]  the real deal and you're meant to get confused and spend all your time and
[2:48:58.360 --> 2:49:07.040]  energy wondering if I'm real or not so that you wonder if you're real instead
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:12.080]  of going out and taking action warning people getting involved going to these
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:15.120]  county commissioner meetings city council meetings when your congressman
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:19.000]  comes to town everything I've been saying to show that we the majority don't
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:25.960]  agree with the issues I try to cover actual issues and trends instead half of
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:30.560]  our movement spends their time talking about me and whether I'm real or not
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:35.240]  and that's great if I was just a Hollywood star and it was whether I was on
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:42.360]  the tabloids or not but it's bad so it's good for me overall because any
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:47.720]  publicity is good publicity but it's bad for the overall awakening that you're
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:53.000]  not out there doing positive meaningful real work that you're caught up in

[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:11.520]  I mean it's just the truth he wrote this stuff and I influenced him clearly to
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:15.440]  get more credible now that I've researched it because as UFO stuff wasn't
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:19.680]  working and always changing his stories about the aliens and stuff in the
[2:50:19.680 --> 2:50:24.640]  meetings and wild stuff and then he changed all the story down the road and
[2:50:24.640 --> 2:50:28.240]  became the big Patriot leader and he's gonna fight the New World Order and he's
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:32.760]  the only leader and everybody else is full of baloney and nobody's good but
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:39.040]  him remember that because again and I think he went crazy but I've seen local
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:42.520]  talk show hosts that have 10,000 listeners go crazy they can't handle the
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:52.200]  power me I become more humble as we gain momentum and so I trust in God we'll take

[2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:31.760]  people just see this as turf and try to tear down others and so I'm the biggest
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:35.440]  thing in the anti-new water movement there is in the world now there's no
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:39.280]  debating that and I'm not it's been that case about five six years and we
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:44.360]  haven't liked to say it but it's really undisputed now and so we're going to get
[2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:48.240]  attacked and so people need to know that so I just say don't even defend us out
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:52.400]  there on the web don't waste your time wake up new people warn them about the
[2:54:52.400 --> 2:54:56.320]  vaccines warn about the new world order warn about the fluoride the chem

[2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:14.240]  blocking them dissipating them knocked them all out but killed them and so we're
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:18.720]  on a record drought and the White House admits it head of eco science John
[2:55:18.720 --> 2:55:22.080]  Holdren says they're doing it to save you but when you actually read his
[2:55:22.080 --> 2:55:25.360]  State Department of Random 200 and other publications that he and Henry
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:29.680]  Kissinger wrote they say they'll use weather weapons to make people starve and
[2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:33.160]  food is a weapon and war and famine they're doing it I wanted to get into

[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:23.000]  of the show right now I want to go over the news and break down a couple key
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:29.280]  points of where this police state is going
[3:00:33.600 --> 3:00:41.400]  in this revolution it is important that we keep our heads about us it is
[3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:47.520]  important that we not get sucked into violence because the establishment wants
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:54.720]  that and it is essential in what they're doing that they divide the left and right
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:01:01.800]  black and white and down so many other lines man from woman liberal from
[3:01:01.800 --> 3:01:06.720]  conservative libertarian from socialist and we can all agree to disagree the
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:10.840]  issue is we're being looted and robbed by offshore banks big government is their
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:14.280]  tool to extract our wealth and to use regulations to shut down their
[3:01:14.280 --> 3:01:21.160]  competition and to empower their select corporations and the democratic
[3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:28.080]  leadership is running around all over television and the media saying that
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:32.920]  anyone that protest health care is a racist and is a criminal and is a
[3:01:32.920 --> 3:01:39.520]  terrorist and they're now canceling their town halls saying it's too dangerous
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:47.520]  so the message is we're terrorist and that's all over the news AP reports
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:54.400]  health care outburst for shadow a hot august loud outburst hot tempers and
[3:01:54.400 --> 3:01:58.480]  pleas for civility at town hall meetings around the country Saturday for
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:01.960]  shadowed a long hot august for democratic lawmakers returning home face
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:06.240]  resistance to proposals to perform the nation's costly health care system this
[3:02:06.240 --> 3:02:12.360]  is another hoax by the AP ladies and gentlemen I don't know I've probably
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:15.880]  seen 20 videos the last two weeks and I'm not even looking for him I mean it's
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:20.120]  more than that I saw four or five last night my inbox I sent them to Kurt
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:23.240]  Nemo and Paul Watson and Steve but they're so busy I don't even know they
[3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:28.400]  posted them all it's everywhere of republicans being booed off the
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:33.120]  staged I've seen three videos of corn and being booed I've seen videos of
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:36.800]  hey belly Hutchinson being booed I've seen videos of governor Perry being
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:42.640]  booed that's just where I live in Austin Texas now Democrats go out Lloyd
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:46.320]  dogged goes out and gets booed email letters to his constituents that's who
[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:51.680]  was there the whole crowd you can see the crowd in the video maybe nine out of
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:55.240]  ten or booing him and yelling at him there is like ten percent looking
[3:02:55.240 --> 3:02:58.400]  puffy going stop it and they turn around and face the crowd with dogged
[3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:04.240]  stop it stop it or it may be his staffers but the point is the people are
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:08.680]  mad everybody knows that you're mad I'm mad this claim that none of us are mad
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:15.000]  and it's all staged that's targeting sheeple because sheeple only go off what
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:19.200]  the rest of the herd the rest the lemmings are doing and so when they see
[3:03:19.200 --> 3:03:22.040]  people waking up and getting angry and talking about ending the Fed and fight
[3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:26.520]  in the new world order which is now the big buzz they can't set the agenda
[3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:31.720]  anymore they can't just make it about whatever they want they can't just make
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:39.840]  it about you know it's racist to talk about Obama or it's racist to not be
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:43.360]  for the gun control bills I mean for six seven months they've been saying the
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:46.840]  bills don't exist and then people found all the bills and found that it was
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:50.800]  true vicious anti-second amendment so that blew up in their face what's
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:54.640]  happened is this administration came in with a bunch of former Clinton and Bush
[3:03:54.640 --> 3:03:59.400]  people lied more than Bush or Clinton ever did it's hard to believe Obama's
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:03.960]  even worse than both those jokers I mean this guy really is a con artist he
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:08.800]  really is punking everybody but he's a puppet himself so the approval ratings
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:12.680]  gone from the mid 80s to the mid 40s now it's dropping like a rock just boom
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:18.880]  every week and they're panicking and people are mad I mean all these bills
[3:04:18.880 --> 3:04:22.120]  cap and trade socialist health care they tried to pass it in the House without a
[3:04:22.120 --> 3:04:27.560]  vote but then the session ended and the new talking point is oh there's no
[3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:31.360]  there's not even a health care bill to debate yeah because it's gone back to
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:36.520]  conference but we have what the bill said we've gone over it so well the big
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:42.100]  issue is how are they gonna hit and attack those of us that want liberty and
[3:04:42.100 --> 3:04:45.360]  freedom and are exposing them and how should we respond to that and deal with
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:49.320]  that and what what should we expect to see in the next few months because the

[3:05:25.640 --> 3:05:29.280]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane
[3:05:29.280 --> 3:05:32.600]  and dangerous summer storm season is here again every year thousands of

[3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:10.960]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:13.800 --> 3:08:18.200]  okay I'm breaking down the fact that we're now in the beginning stages of
[3:08:18.200 --> 3:08:23.600]  revolution we're now in it it's now here there's no doubt all the indicators all
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:27.920]  the points of data are there the establishment knew oh this is so
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:31.320]  essential the establishment knew all of this was coming has been
[3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:37.160]  prepositioning preparing building what is at least a trillion-plus dollar
[3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:42.120]  infrastructure the entire Homeland Security the entire it's more than a
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:46.520]  trillion actually the defense budget's over a trillion a year but they're
[3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:51.920]  focusing much of the Homeland Security Department of Defense infrastructure
[3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:58.160]  into suppressing the United States in fact I saw a cartoon this weekend meant
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.560]  to send it to you guys and forget where I saw it and it showed a map of the
[3:09:02.560 --> 3:09:06.680]  United States with Canada and Mexico to the north and south with giant
[3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:12.400]  artillery cannons swung around on the borders all aiming into the country
[3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:17.760]  fortress America I believe was the headline it was a big cartoon for a
[3:09:17.760 --> 3:09:23.720]  newspaper so I just see so much great stuff but the point is is that it shows
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:28.320]  all the cannons none of them swung out they're all swung in but see that's what
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:33.920]  Homeland Security and this new Pentagon system is worldwide they're not just
[3:09:33.920 --> 3:09:37.600]  exporting weapons and systems now they're exporting how governments
[3:09:37.600 --> 3:09:42.160]  suppress their people and how to build the biometric national ID card grids how
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:47.280]  to federalize local police how to put in this MIT designed face-scanning camera
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:52.320]  license plate scanning system like like eagle eye that movie people kept saying
[3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:57.240]  watch eagle eye watch eagle eye I bought it watched it when I jog this weekend on
[3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:03.160]  the treadmill in two parts and that is exactly the surveillance isn't that
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:11.000]  level yet but it's probably 60% of that and they're trying to wire everything in
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:15.720]  to these new grids so that it can be that bad but it's not gonna be some
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:22.840]  computer like the hell nine thousand going after people it's gonna be humans
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:28.320]  in control of those AI systems we're just a few people a very small group
[3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:32.440]  because they they write about this and talk about this can implement giant
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:38.200]  operations whole wars operation guillotine I told you this long before I
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:43.960]  saw the movie of eagle eye operation guillotine is a real operation that's
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:50.280]  what's so crazy about this movie but it's a pentagon plan to to decapitate
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:58.200]  governments worldwide in a matter of minutes when I've seen in congressional
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:06.160]  documents it's called they reference pentagon plans to decapitate multiple
[3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:13.720]  world leaders simultaneously and decapitate is guillotine so and that's
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:19.280]  what homeland security is is it is a it puts America in a decapitated it puts
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:23.560]  all the governors the senators the house members the legislative key members I
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:27.160]  mean this is admitted in the John Warner defense authorization act they
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:33.960]  publicly have put the government in a guillotine and they're transferring the
[3:11:33.960 --> 3:11:39.480]  power to corporate entities and mercenary entities remind me to cover the
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:43.200]  blackwater it's so horrible I kind of mentally blocked it out for a week now
[3:11:43.200 --> 3:11:46.160]  and haven't really covered it properly because I've just been researching it
[3:11:46.160 --> 3:11:52.080]  and it's just go they're operating all around us I mean these people are
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:56.600]  literally out of the bowels of hell and it's a macho culture where they're into
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:02.280]  one upping each other on how evil they are man look out it's easy to be evil
[3:12:02.280 --> 3:12:11.920]  fools it's hard to be good I just this guy man there you read about what they
[3:12:11.920 --> 3:12:18.120]  did to those Iraqi children what they do back home with their wives or Mr.
[3:12:18.120 --> 3:12:27.640]  Prince's wife died young didn't she but hey Henry the 8th what do you do I just
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:33.360]  I just you see it's a synthesis the most evil people are competing with each
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:37.520]  other for the power so you get the most horrible mutation of evil in power
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:43.000]  you understand that folks that's what's bad about corruption it isn't cute yeah
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:46.960]  more and more I realize any form of corruption is bad any form of evil is
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:51.640]  bad and I'm not on some high horse I'm not perfect but now I understand you know
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:55.560]  they bring you up to think that evil and corruptions like cute and funny and the
[3:12:55.560 --> 3:13:00.080]  devil's fun he's got good-looking girls with him that in the case folks the
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:04.080]  devil won't show but dead dead in the hammer you have your believe in the
[3:13:04.080 --> 3:13:08.600]  devil it's a spirit it's an idea it's manifesting through human beings the
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:12.880]  devil likes burning cities and dead babies the devil likes the stench of
[3:13:12.880 --> 3:13:19.200]  rotten flesh the devil likes terror in innocence and we have conjured it ladies
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:22.680]  and gentlemen that's what all these TV shows fantasizing about torturing
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:28.040]  people's kids millions of Americans and Europeans watching it fantasizing going
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:31.720]  into the role playing mentally your subconscious is taking that on is real
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:37.320]  when you watch movies like hostile and you watch movies like the saw and all of
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:42.080]  this and the good guy tortures people to show them that they deserve it you see
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:50.760]  this is psych warfare programming and you have now become a monster so we're
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:54.520]  now seeing that they tried to poison us intellectually and spiritually so we'd
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:13:59.640]  be weak I love the parable of if you can't understand it for some of you out
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:04.400]  there on fluoride and Prozac and who watch five hours of TV a day and can
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:10.320]  even understand me go rent the movie Pinocchio it's a Walt Disney special the
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:13.000]  New York Times will quote me as saying Pinocchio is real that's not what I'm
[3:14:13.000 --> 3:14:16.760]  saying it's an analogy they'll build a straw man but that's that's fine it's
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:22.880]  what my enemies did Pinocchio they bring you in they give you some beer they
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:27.120]  give you a pool table they tell you yeah knock some windows out have some fun
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:34.680]  and then you turn into jackasses into donkeys to then be loaded on a ship
[3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:39.480]  taken to a slave island and then Monstro comes along and the rest is
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:49.640]  history the whale almost symbolizing judgment see it was actually the judgment
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:54.320]  that actually of the destruction that actually allowed them to get out of the
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:59.080]  slave ship very very deep I mean you know I mean big messages in that film
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:02.840]  and after that most the messages are really destructive and bad but you got
[3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:06.640]  the young kid and you know Pinocchio he's out for his first time and the scam
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:11.680]  artists come over and go hello come with me my friend you'll see the world and
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:18.680]  the and and the weasel and the fox take him over to the you know corrupt scam
[3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:25.680]  artists your gypsy guy at the carnival and they use him see rebelling against
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:31.120]  his dad he thought oh dad just didn't want me to have fun he went from one
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:38.160]  bondage to bondage again and and and that's how this really works because
[3:15:38.160 --> 3:15:43.720]  once you give in to the spirit of pettiness and mindlessness and corruption
[3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:48.000]  and believe me we all struggle against it every day it now blinds you it makes
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:53.520]  you weak it sucks you in to a very destructive culture and you become a
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:16:00.560]  slave myself included you know I end up here at the office making bad jokes not
[3:16:00.560 --> 3:16:05.720]  really dirty jokes but you know you know jokes about people and and and and and
[3:16:05.720 --> 3:16:12.240]  I'm even trying to stop that I'm really trying to focus my mind on what I'm
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:16.600]  doing and how I'm behaving and it's helping me become a better person and
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:20.320]  opening up my mind and I said I was talking about revolution here revolution
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:25.600]  is an individual action it happens inside and you want to bring down the new
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:29.040]  order stop fighting with your wife even if they're wrong and in your face it'll
[3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:33.880]  stop when you're not giving into them not not going along not being counter
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:39.480]  dominated but when you stop even playing along with it and lovingly stop it same
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:46.240]  thing with your husband same thing in this whole culture and the establishment
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:50.560]  wants us fighting with each other they want to eradicate the family in hundreds
[3:16:50.560 --> 3:16:54.080]  of government textbooks we have that we've listed and covered and and posted
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:59.400]  in articles at info wars.com like eco science I got the New York Times saying
[3:16:59.400 --> 3:17:06.440]  children are bad for the earth and thus families are bad New York Times Friday
[3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:09.840]  I mean this message is there you're seeing it you watch TV and read the
[3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:15.040]  newspaper everything that's good and decent is competition to them because
[3:17:15.040 --> 3:17:19.600]  the good will stand up against them so they know to have total consolidation of
[3:17:19.600 --> 3:17:25.720]  power for power sake they've got to make you evil they've got to put that there
[3:17:25.720 --> 3:17:30.240]  that their virus of evil into you so that you break down and so they can
[3:17:30.240 --> 3:17:35.920]  control you I mean this is even if you're not a spiritual person even if you
[3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:38.600]  don't believe in a creator or believe in these laws of the universe that they're
[3:17:38.600 --> 3:17:43.920]  real folks they're real I mean this is this is going on they they traffic in
[3:17:43.920 --> 3:17:52.000]  men's souls they know what they're doing and so they know we're on the edge of
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:56.160]  revolution going into revolution with people everywhere angry city councils
[3:17:56.160 --> 3:18:00.240]  county commissioners water district school boards they're all being screamed
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:03.960]  down people are mad period they know criminals are running things they're
[3:18:03.960 --> 3:18:07.720]  angry they know no matter who they vote in and only gets worse gets worse under
[3:18:07.720 --> 3:18:12.360]  Clinton worse under Bush worse under Obama on and on and on and on they know
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:16.440]  it's a scam they're just now starting to figure out more details they're starting
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:19.880]  to get informed they're finding out a private bank owns the money supply and
[3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:23.360]  runs the country they're getting angry look at how they tried to demonize
[3:18:23.360 --> 3:18:26.800]  Ron Paul a year and a half ago and said he's a terrorist his supporters are
[3:18:26.800 --> 3:18:33.080]  terrorists he's dangerous he's a racist but notice that failed and so now they
[3:18:33.080 --> 3:18:37.960]  try to embracing but still demonizing the movement they're gonna fail
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:42.120]  demonizing the movement against the New World Order now and try to embrace it
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:50.760]  just enough to camouflage themselves and they're doing that now they're doing
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:18:54.480]  that now but they also have people in their own system that actually are on
[3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:58.800]  our side that are trying anyway they can to rebel so something wonderful is
[3:18:58.800 --> 3:19:02.000]  happening something beautiful is happening something very very serious is
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:07.080]  happening something massively historical is happening and so I have no doubt
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:09.840]  these are the top of things are going to do they're going to have some shootings
[3:19:09.840 --> 3:19:15.560]  at these demonstrations in an Italy it'll end up being a mental patient who'd
[3:19:15.560 --> 3:19:19.560]  been in the army who they released guaranteed will be a hypnosis setup I
[3:19:19.560 --> 3:19:23.160]  think that's in the cars I'm not saying it's gonna happen but that's the kind
[3:19:23.160 --> 3:19:27.480]  of thing I've looked for they're gonna have more thugs beating people up they
[3:19:27.480 --> 3:19:30.920]  may even hire they got a lot of convicted felons who will go beat people up
[3:19:30.920 --> 3:19:35.600]  get put in jail and even take the rat for 50 grand under the table because they
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:41.760]  know they'll just get a few months in in county they are well I'm gonna continue
[3:19:41.760 --> 3:19:46.080]  breaking down how they're gonna counter us and then how we need to be ready to
[3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:49.320]  counter them when we get back on the other side then your phone calls coming
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:54.840]  up and I'm gonna play this video of them beating up an 87 year old woman and a

[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:07.160]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit
[3:20:07.160 --> 3:20:10.960]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that

[3:20:37.200 --> 3:20:40.680]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve the strength and

[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:21.400]  fall off probably gonna skin your knee but four or five 10 15 20 tries maybe you
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:25.680]  know it took me 15 20 tries of falling off the bicycle took a couple weeks to
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:30.880]  get off the training wheels but the issue is if you never got on the bike I
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:34.400]  mean I know this is simple beating the new old orders like going out to a
[3:28:34.400 --> 3:28:38.360]  bicycle you never got on and we're like a nation of adults that never got on a
[3:28:38.360 --> 3:28:41.860]  bicycle and the media saying it's radical it's terrorist to get on a
[3:28:41.860 --> 3:28:47.480]  bicycle it's it's dangerous to go to a town hall it's bad see they're also
[3:28:47.480 --> 3:28:51.200]  saying the town halls are dangerous and bad and there we now discovered are

[3:29:20.640 --> 3:29:26.200]  creating the droughts that's a lot more scary than going to some town hall where

[3:36:36.600 --> 3:36:40.720]  they're erasing they're very afraid of this Obama Joker image and they say it's
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:44.400]  racist they're taking it down that's why I decided to have the contest because
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:48.600]  they say it's racist and if I mean if we let them start saying hey that Gadsden
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:52.400]  hats racist or oh you don't want to turn your guns in that's racist that's what
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:56.360]  they're doing now or oh you don't like bologna sandwich that's racist what I
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:37:03.400]  you don't like Italians I mean it's becoming this crazy thing now where you

[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:18.800]  say or do anything actually getting hungry thinking about Mexican food and
[3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:25.800]  German food now they only have a German Mexican fusion that be the most baller
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:33.080]  restaurant ever make you imagine that anyways it's a good idea somebody's gonna
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:40.240]  open one now but imagine some sauerkraut on some beef and cheese enchiladas all
[3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:46.080]  right side issue Cuban food's almost like a cross between German and Spanish

[3:38:04.480 --> 3:38:08.440]  banks that came in and took over our nation so we're a counter revolution
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:14.720]  really but the establishment sees us as a revolution so that's really it be active
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:17.640]  every day tell your email list your friends your family about good radio
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:24.160]  shows like this one spread the word get involved call Congress you just and let
[3:38:24.160 --> 3:38:28.360]  them know hey we're not taking your flu shot by the way I got to say this Dr.
[3:38:28.360 --> 3:38:32.560]  Dean Adele who I've had on before we're getting back on if you'll do it I heard
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:35.240]  him yesterday driving into the office because he's on the same station as me
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:42.320]  here locally he is just going absolutely all out now with propaganda he was
[3:38:42.320 --> 3:38:46.880]  saying if you don't take the MMR if you don't take the whooping cough shot your
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:50.880]  child is going to gas for air and horribly brutally die and you want to
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:54.680]  watch the videos online of children dying of whooping cough gasping and if
[3:38:54.680 --> 3:38:57.920]  you don't take the flu shot they're going to die and you need to ask the
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:02.080]  school what percentage of the parents are kids are vaccinated and if the kids
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:05.040]  aren't vaccinated at that school you need to sue those parents that don't
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:10.120]  vaccinate and we need to arrest these parents and it needs to be illegal oh
[3:39:10.120 --> 3:39:15.520]  the hoax isn't working that it was the law to take the vaccines there's all
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:19.880]  these articles where they're saying oh it's terrible the New York Times there
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:24.720]  are some counties in northern California highly educated highly informed the
[3:39:24.720 --> 3:39:31.360]  liberals finally woke up look out where 70 plus percent he was reading the
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:35.160]  statistics I saw the article on info or friday we had a link to it they can see
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:40.480]  76% a whole group of counties where they don't take the vaccine and then he was
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:44.040]  going they need to arrest those parents they need to arrest them they need to
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:48.440]  sue them why your kids are gonna get sick because theirs aren't vaccinated hey
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:53.560]  dr. Dean if the kids have had the MMR and the anthrax and the smallpox and the
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:59.040]  hepatitis a b and c and the Gardasil and the and the 70 plus people correct me
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:03.040]  it's not 60 plus they now try to force it 70 and they're saying within two years
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:07.120]  will be over a hundred we're talking almost every day a new shot oh school
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:11.320]  time here's your show that's totally normal and all the times vaccines have
[3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:15.680]  killed people look I'm sure they can make a clean good vaccine that wouldn't
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:19.680]  kill people that are the hammer and I believe in immunization if it was run
[3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:25.520]  by angels but studies show it's causing autoimmune problems we're not designed to
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:29.640]  have this stuff injected into us it's kind of like antibiotics work but now
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:33.200]  it's made all these super flesh-eating bacterias and and and is making it ten
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:37.600]  times worse you should use it very sparingly but the vaccine makers make
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:41.560]  new ones all the time they need to give it to somebody to make money they come
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:46.400]  in lobby to do it I mean what can I stop at a hundred shots a year oh no I'm
[3:40:46.400 --> 3:40:52.600]  sorry 200 oh then 300 then 365 how about five thousand shots you know instead
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:56.960]  oh it's that's what brave new worlds like that the actual eugenesis that books
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:00.560]  based on reality that's what Aldous Huxley wrote well you can actually read
[3:41:00.560 --> 3:41:05.320]  the brave new world written by the White House science are eco science in fact
[3:41:05.320 --> 3:41:08.560]  have Aaron bring a few stacks of the books in here because people need to see
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:12.000]  this ought to do a YouTube video you ought to see my house just what's come in
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.200]  the last two weeks as giant stacks of evil books because we're getting the
[3:41:15.200 --> 3:41:18.640]  actual quotes out of them but I don't have time to pull all these quotes video
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:21.400]  at all and put it in the film because I'm busy doing the radio I'm not
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:25.960]  complaining either it's just I've got too much evidence it's too much evil you
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:29.240]  know Tarpley finally scan the whole book he's a speed reader it was worse than
[3:41:29.240 --> 3:41:36.920]  we even thought we got him coming back on tomorrow for part two about this the
[3:41:36.920 --> 3:41:41.200]  point is they're trying to terrorize people now and absolutely if your kids
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:45.360]  using intervening as drugs or you know sharing needles or having a bunch of
[3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:49.720]  sexual partners they can get hepatitis why are they giving babies that they're
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:55.000]  not going to be on heroin or having sexual partners what's the biggest one
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:42:00.760]  time exposure ever school lunch program 1996 over 9,000 children contracted
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:05.800]  hepatitis from the school lunch program from berries grown in Mexico sprayed
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:12.200]  with fresh human feces oh honeypots work just fine as they're called in Germany
[3:42:12.200 --> 3:42:18.720]  if you let it brew for months but you don't put live fresh human feces on
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:24.840]  food it'll kill you it'll give you diseases it'll give you salmonella it'll
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:29.240]  give you hepatitis it'll give you all sorts of stuff I know that's radical but
[3:42:29.240 --> 3:42:33.640]  eating fresh crap is not good for you it's gonna be honest it's a fine
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:39.000]  fertilizer done people for thousands of years but you got to let it rot and it's
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:42.960]  got to be mixed in with other stuff there is a way to do it side issue the
[3:42:42.960 --> 3:42:52.200]  point is is that Mexico sprays live crap fresh crap hours after it goes down
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:55.960]  then we have toilets in most places that right after it goes in the stream look
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:43:00.240]  at these books partly has even more come on in here I mean this is just the
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:03.440]  stuff that came in last week well there's brave new world the Cassandra
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:08.200]  conference we've got this one here a strategic defense in the future of the
[3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:13.480]  arms race and we got another one here global ecology this is holdren earlick
[3:43:13.480 --> 3:43:18.640]  man in the ecosphere I mean we just got stacks of these I know you've got stacks
[3:43:18.640 --> 3:43:25.200]  at home I mean they just go on and on Aaron just a quick question we're
[3:43:25.200 --> 3:43:28.840]  going to calls have I even scratched the surface of what's in eco science not at
[3:43:28.840 --> 3:43:32.760]  all and holdren's tried to distance himself from these writings but it's
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:38.160]  decade after we have c-span of him saying it 96 oh I'm sorry you best
[3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:42.600]  heard we have you he has dozens of books and the ones he's he's worked on other
[3:43:42.600 --> 3:43:48.360]  books to I mean it's a whole career it's it's absurd this guy is like this guy is
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:53.040]  like I don't know thinking somebody that writes you know was football books
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:57.400]  he's written 30 football books it's what he does he talks about how to poison you
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:01.960]  and take your kids I mean you know he's a psychopathic demon he's worse than the
[3:44:01.960 --> 3:44:06.080]  worst James Bond villain he's he is the James Bond villain from Moonraker let's
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:08.800]  pull up the James Bond villain for Moonraker let's Google that you know the
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:13.800]  mad scientist industrialist who wants to kill the majority of the planet yeah
[3:44:13.800 --> 3:44:19.880]  those movies are based on real people folks he is the Moonraker villain and
[3:44:19.880 --> 3:44:24.320]  you find out they all have this view this is the majority view Aaron yeah I
[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:28.240]  mean it's the dominant view going back to the 1900s eugenics it's you had more
[3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:32.520]  than this I just last week I saw like four stacks of books those are just the
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:36.200]  Holdren's right there oh no no I wanted all the eugenics books oh I mean but I
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:39.600]  mean tell folks how many tarply books you've got well tarply had another four
[3:44:39.600 --> 3:44:42.880]  or five when we went to interview him and I know I've seen the list there's
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:47.400]  just like probably dozens of dozens of books yeah no I had my wife order I
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:52.120]  didn't count by 30 yeah 30 came in and I'm just flipping to the index and it's
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:55.240]  just it's just everywhere sterilization everything and we know he's proud of
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:58.760]  eco science because it's on that bookshelf and that all the big interviews
[3:44:58.760 --> 3:45:02.320]  he does is eco science right behind him oh I I'm not for this book it's just
[3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:10.880]  right here oh my god I love it hold it's like oh I'm doing a TV interview yes
[3:45:10.880 --> 3:45:15.440]  oh here let me oh yeah there's the villain that there's Holdren even looks
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:23.080]  like Holdren oh my god put it right next to Holdren I think we're on to
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:29.040]  something here could be I'll see you commander thanks well Ian Fleming that
[3:45:29.040 --> 3:45:33.400]  wrote the James Bond books was MI6 for that he was OSS and he said oh take your
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:39.960]  books yeah these are just the ones by Holdren here take your books Aaron
[3:45:39.960 --> 3:45:44.440]  here you go call him Aaron that's how Paul announces his name I like Aaron
[3:45:44.440 --> 3:45:49.520]  better Aaron good job commander back into the nest alright let's take a few
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:54.040]  calls here Sean in Minnesota thank you for holding
[3:45:54.040 --> 3:46:03.160]  Alex I have an idea for how folks could do could send a frightening message to
[3:46:03.160 --> 3:46:09.520]  the bankers and what that is is every year when April 15th comes around don't
[3:46:09.520 --> 3:46:15.880]  send one stinking penny to the IRS and the reason I'm suggesting that Alice
[3:46:15.880 --> 3:46:21.280]  Alex is because if you think of it in terms of those collection agencies who
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:25.640]  will call you and hound you if you fall delinquent on an account well that's
[3:46:25.640 --> 3:46:30.480]  essentially what the IRS is the IRS have you noticed that you fill out your
[3:46:30.480 --> 3:46:35.000]  income tax check to the Federal Reserve it goes right into Geithner's hand he
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:40.240]  goes thank you I'm the moon raker villain I'm going to kill you I mean it
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:44.640]  who could make that up how freakish is it that today it's not enough that they
[3:46:44.640 --> 3:46:49.400]  steal all our labor that they want to kill us because you know the elite are
[3:46:49.400 --> 3:46:53.240]  tired of crowds and people and I've been there when some of the local
[3:46:53.240 --> 3:46:56.240]  environmentalists show up at Hamilton pool and I'm swimming they're like what
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:47:00.200]  are they doing here this should be all the limits the human they're just
[3:47:00.200 --> 3:47:06.800]  control freaks I'm sorry go ahead yeah and that's the thing see none of the
[3:47:06.800 --> 3:47:11.400]  money that the IRS collects from citizens goes to the government the
[3:47:11.400 --> 3:47:16.840]  government does not cast any of your yes not one as Reagan's Commission showed
[3:47:16.840 --> 3:47:19.800]  in 81 goes to run the government because we didn't have the income tax till
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:24.560]  1913 didn't become popular to the mid 50s all the other government taxes fund
[3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:27.760]  the government it all goes to the private banks that's why they've got to
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:31.640]  create a huge debt because it only goes to the interest and they always make our
[3:47:31.640 --> 3:47:36.760]  debt bigger just like a pimp controls his prostitutes we are the whores of the
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:44.720]  earth yes so so what I'm thinking is if we could get I don't think you would
[3:47:44.720 --> 3:47:51.040]  even take all of the citizenry I think if we could get at least half or somewhere
[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:58.080]  there about of people not sending nothing to the IRS on April 15th I can't
[3:47:58.080 --> 3:48:02.640]  say that it would do well that's already happened I mean there's now over 50
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:05.840]  million non-filers the system's panicking good to hear from you by the way
[3:48:05.840 --> 3:48:09.680]  having really plugged this all day we're under massive censorship and I've
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:14.040]  really dropped the ball I'm gonna start the show tomorrow with a report on this
