[00:00.000 --> 00:18.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.960 --> 00:29.280]  so does he live from the info wars comm studios it's Alex Jones welcome to the
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.520]  Alex Jones show on this Friday December 2nd 2016 I'm David Knight your host in
[00:34.520 --> 00:37.560]  the next segment we're gonna have a special report from Alex talking about
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.240]  Trump's victory tour and yet the Democrats still don't get it later in the
[00:42.240 --> 00:45.440]  hour we're going to have a report about how they're still trying to steal the
[00:45.440 --> 00:48.320]  election we've had the very first returns come in from Wisconsin and guess
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.520]  what Hillary Clinton picked up a net of one Donald Trump lost two votes in the
[00:53.520 --> 00:58.680]  recount in the first local area where they brought in the results Donald Trump
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.000]  lost one and Hillary two rather and Hillary Clinton lost one so she gained
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.320]  one vote on him so now she's nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine votes
[01:07.320 --> 01:13.320]  behind this is incredibly stupid and it comes at the time that we see Democrat
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.000]  donors telling the party hey we're done with this don't call me anymore about
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.160]  money you're simply wasting this they're also moving to try to put in Keith
[01:23.160 --> 01:28.520]  Ellison as in a leadership position of the DNC because they're still on
[01:28.520 --> 01:34.960]  this identity politics kick they don't understand the last election they can't
[01:34.960 --> 01:38.560]  accept and won't accept the results we're also going to take a look at more
[01:38.560 --> 01:41.560]  information about the Trump carrier deal you know the more I look at this the
[01:41.560 --> 01:46.440]  more I like it I don't like government handing out special favors to large
[01:46.440 --> 01:51.000]  companies I want the government there to create a level playing field that is
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.640]  conducive to business that means you get rid of regulation you get rid of
[01:54.640 --> 01:57.800]  taxation that is not necessary but especially these regulations that are
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.600]  incredible burden as we pointed out last night we've got a president-elect
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.480]  Trump who is saving jobs doing things that Obama never would that Obama said
[02:08.480 --> 02:11.480]  hey I'd need a magic wand not just my pen and my phone to do this I'd need a
[02:11.480 --> 02:15.280]  magic wand to do it and yet a president-elect who is not going to take
[02:15.280 --> 02:19.160]  office for you another 49 days but it was about 50 days out when he did this
[02:19.160 --> 02:27.560]  saved these jobs from moving and what is Obama doing he's enacting scores of
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.040]  regulations he already I guess it was it was well before Thanksgiving I think we
[02:31.040 --> 02:34.480]  had the story about had hit a record number of regulations this year but
[02:34.480 --> 02:37.760]  then they said hey you still got a couple of months left and he is pushing
[02:37.760 --> 02:43.280]  really hard just 100 of the scores of us not scores it's probably thousands of
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.200]  regulations that they're trying to push through but the 100 top ones would add
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.240]  about two billion dollars of crushing debt to us we got a story here about how
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.840]  new EPA rules will push their costs past one trillion dollars for American
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.880]  persons okay that's $3,000 charge one-time charge per person in America
[03:01.880 --> 03:06.440]  every man woman and child that's the legacy of Obama and as I look at this
[03:06.440 --> 03:10.840]  carrier situation it's interesting to go back and look at the beginning of this
[03:10.840 --> 03:14.960]  year when carrier first announced that they were going to move not only did
[03:14.960 --> 03:19.680]  Obama mock Trump but it was also an amazing failure we didn't talk about
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.120]  this yesterday amazing failure of the kind of stimulus packages that Obama
[03:24.120 --> 03:29.720]  put out there he had actually given massive stimulus to this very company
[03:29.720 --> 03:34.560]  to create green jobs so there's a difference in the priorities he wants
[03:34.560 --> 03:40.440]  to prioritize his green jobs when what we really need are American jobs they
[03:40.440 --> 03:46.320]  don't have most as Trump pointed out he heaped scorn on the idea that we're
[03:46.320 --> 03:49.600]  going to give tax breaks and special incentives to companies which I think is
[03:49.600 --> 03:53.880]  a very healthy thing I don't think Donald Trump gave any direct subsidies to
[03:53.880 --> 03:58.880]  carrier yes Indiana did and it wasn't much it was seven million dollars for to
[03:58.880 --> 04:03.320]  save a thousand jobs over 10-year period that's $700 per employee per year
[04:03.320 --> 04:06.320]  they're going to pay more than that just an income taxes and then carrier is
[04:06.320 --> 04:10.680]  going to invest 16 million so that's two and a half times that subsidy invested
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.320]  in there and that doesn't count all the money that is still going to flow into
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.280]  that economy and go to all the people that are interacting and serving these
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.480]  people that these people are going to be buying goods and services from I see so
[04:23.480 --> 04:27.480]  many different ways that they're trying to soft sell this and say well you know
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.520]  we really can't really it's not really a thousand jobs because it's early only
[04:31.520 --> 04:35.440]  800 union jobs because the rest of these are like engineering and clerical
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.720]  stuff it's like white collar jobs count too that's the bottom line he saved a
[04:39.720 --> 04:44.040]  thousand jobs he says we're going to do it by lowering regulations and lowering
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.600]  taxes that's a great bit of news there stay with us when we come back Alex is
[04:48.600 --> 04:53.520]  going to talk about Donald Trump's victory tour and his quote that we don't have a
[04:53.520 --> 04:59.320]  global flag a global currency and no global citizenship where Americans
[04:59.320 --> 05:05.640]  well Barack Obama is looking pretty stupid right now as a video has surfaced
[05:05.640 --> 05:11.760]  where he is seen making fun of Donald Trump for promising to stop jobs leaving
[05:11.760 --> 05:15.440]  the country he's going to bring all these jobs back well how exactly are you
[05:15.440 --> 05:19.280]  going to do that what are you going to do there's no answer to he just says
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.440]  well I'm gonna I'm gonna negotiate a better deal well how what how exactly
[05:23.440 --> 05:27.800]  are you going to negotiate that what magic wand do you have and usually the
[05:27.800 --> 05:33.040]  answer is you don't have an answer well Obama President-elect Trump has yet to
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.200]  begin his presidency and he is already saving jobs in America and he has
[05:38.200 --> 05:43.160]  successfully negotiated a deal with air conditioner company carrier to keep
[05:43.160 --> 05:50.240]  1,000 jobs in the US no magic wand just good negotiating skills and a passion
[05:50.240 --> 05:55.600]  to put America first and save the working-class hero I'm Darren McBreen and

[08:18.480 --> 08:30.400]  Jones something truly remarkable is happening on president-elect Donald
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.640]  J. Trump's victory tour around the United States he is fulfilling his
[08:34.640 --> 08:40.960]  promise to continue to use the bully pulpit to promote the idea that is
[08:40.960 --> 08:46.080]  coffin nails to the unelected tyrannical system of globalism and global
[08:46.080 --> 08:51.040]  government he is talking about Americanism versus globalism and it's
[08:51.040 --> 08:57.480]  continuing to define it as a competing system to the unelected global system
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.520]  and he breaks down how it makes us totally alone with no culture with no
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.800]  flag with no shared values how it attacks family how it attacks individualism
[09:06.800 --> 09:11.920]  how it takes our identity away and that's why globalism cannot allow the
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.640]  nation-state or the family or even religious freedom to operate because
[09:16.640 --> 09:21.560]  free open societies compete with it in a way that it cannot survive
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.640]  Trump is simplifying this he's not dumbing it down because he's bringing
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.200]  something back to a culture and back to a world that for 50 years has seen
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.840]  eradicated but this is truly sunshine being brought back to the world he also
[09:36.840 --> 09:42.360]  talks about how this is the one area he's wrong that Obama and our leaders
[09:42.360 --> 09:46.840]  don't know what they're doing with these political systems they've set up but
[09:46.840 --> 09:49.760]  then he goes on to admit that they've sold us out of special interest and he
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.680]  tells the truth there they have parlayed our entire industrial and cultural and
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.620]  scientific base that the military industrial complex took over in the
[09:58.620 --> 10:02.320]  fifties and sixties once they took control of it the globalist exported
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.680]  overseas as contingent for global corporations to take control of
[10:06.680 --> 10:13.120]  India China and Mexico and 160 plus other nations but once this global plan is
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.640]  public as I keep hammering it's over and the enemy has thought that we were so
[10:17.640 --> 10:24.120]  stupid so dumb down that they wrote it in constant publications over the last
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.960]  60 years tell the New York Times back in the fifties would have big huge
[10:28.960 --> 10:35.240]  cover stories promoting 10 regions of the US 10 regions of the world and three
[10:35.240 --> 10:41.760]  super regions and pitching a FEMA control arm and COG for every nation state to be
[10:41.760 --> 10:48.040]  controlled by the central technocracy the technocracy movement of the 20s so
[10:48.040 --> 10:52.520]  what we're facing is a Goldman Sachs technocracy movement launched in the
[10:52.520 --> 10:56.920]  20s Rob Jacobson has done to tell reports on this so of our other reporters
[10:56.920 --> 11:01.560]  but in future reports I'm going to lay out from their own writings exactly what
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.280]  globalism is and how it's being established but the scientific
[11:06.280 --> 11:11.520]  implementation of the British Empire model corporately on the world now to
[11:11.520 --> 11:15.040]  be clear it's not the British that are doing it that you see the British
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.560]  pulling out of it it is a model that corporations have combined forces to
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.040]  create so this is an amazing time to be alive Americanism not globalism and
[11:26.040 --> 11:30.200]  Trump goes on to say we're not going to penalize other countries we're going to
[11:30.200 --> 11:37.000]  create a two-way street a win-win not a one-way street and again globalism is
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.160]  about breaking the West not letting us be dominant so the globalist can be
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.840]  dominant they're not lowering us in some mass political correctness like they
[11:46.840 --> 11:50.560]  push on the surface to unify the world they're not trying to raise the third
[11:50.560 --> 11:55.400]  world they're trying to lower us to that level they're trying to install a
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.760]  authoritarianism in I was just reading in The Economist yesterday and a bunch of
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.280]  other big publications they were pushing China's authoritarianism and saying
[12:04.280 --> 12:09.960]  look at how messy American quote democracy is how dangerous it is that
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.720]  we have Trump because now the whole global system is in this array now
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.760]  before I go to this powerful excerpt of Trump's speech yesterday it's posted in
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.920]  full on info wars.com I want to warn everyone we're winning the war right
[12:23.920 --> 12:28.880]  now that we've not won the overall complete war we're winning battles they're
[12:28.880 --> 12:32.120]  going to strike back we were already on the verge of a global collapse next year
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.360]  if they plan to use to bring in total control of their own words will they
[12:35.360 --> 12:38.960]  still launch it knowing the Trump will expose they're the ones behind it do
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.320]  they think we're stupid enough to actually buy that the collapse is our
[12:42.320 --> 12:49.840]  fault if they still pull it these are the big questions but my friends we have
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.240]  seen the technocrats sell out our country and sell out our world they have
[12:54.240 --> 12:59.400]  seen the people have seen and witnessed the incredible unprecedented
[12:59.400 --> 13:04.200]  corruption and so again now that we're ideologically actually have a culture
[13:04.200 --> 13:07.520]  that is that that is the Renaissance culture and the fact that that's being
[13:07.520 --> 13:11.280]  rediscovered on a planetary scale will be the end of these people if we
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.240]  continue to promote it that's why MSM dinosaur control media continues to
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.000]  act like there's no such thing as globalism no such thing as
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  technocracy no such thing as EU bureaucrats or the Davos forum or the
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.560]  Bilderberg group because if they ever admit it exists and they ever admit
[13:30.560 --> 13:34.000]  it's ongoing and if we ever read their white papers which they think the
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.640]  general public are too dumb to actually look into it's game over so now is the
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.080]  education period to re-put out films on Bilderberg to put out fact sheets with
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.280]  links to globalist statements and white papers admitting planetary unelected
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.960]  tyrannical government now is the time to reach out to people because Trump and
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.000]  Nigel Farage and Putin and others are making it safe again to tell the truth
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.120]  and expose the real paradigm the bullying of anyone trying to expose the
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.840]  new order like myself or Ron Paul or Barry Goldwater or Anthony Sutton or
[14:05.840 --> 14:10.560]  Ronald Reagan early on or Matt Drudge or or Joseph Farah or any of the
[14:10.560 --> 14:15.800]  trailblazers that bullying failed thanks to your courage the listeners of this
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.720]  broadcast and know this info wars hits the main ground troop hard charging
[14:20.720 --> 14:25.440]  organization that actually has the fire-breathing patriots that will not
[14:25.440 --> 14:29.320]  back down you are the shock troops you are the special forces of the fight
[14:29.320 --> 14:32.640]  against the new old order and I salute you all as well as the amazing crew
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.240]  I'll say this in closing and then go to this excerpt of Trump's historic speech
[14:36.240 --> 14:40.200]  he talks about world leaders that he talked to and one in particular that
[14:40.200 --> 14:45.640]  finally said he respects America again because of what the American people
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.280]  did because it was honorable it was what made us great I don't know that it was
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.760]  Putin but I know Putin's made similar statements to his press so I bet you my
[14:54.760 --> 14:59.040]  bottom dollar it was Vladimir Putin that said that America can take the moral
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.880]  high ground again and folks are some of our second-guessing trouble some of his
[15:03.880 --> 15:07.840]  appointments I'm gonna trust him until he actually gets into power till we see
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.000]  what he actually starts doing because so far he's been delivering before he's
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.280]  even president you know in office only president-elect and he's delivering the
[15:15.280 --> 15:20.240]  info war causing a revocable damage to the globalist system by pointing out
[15:20.240 --> 15:25.600]  what a giant oppressive unelected disgusting fraud it is here is Donald
[15:25.600 --> 15:30.720]  Trump yesterday in one of his victory speeches Americanism not globalism
[15:30.720 --> 15:37.840]  delivered for too long Washington has tried to put us in boxes they separate
[15:37.840 --> 15:45.160]  us by race by age by income by geography by place of birth we spent
[15:45.160 --> 15:51.840]  too much time focusing on what divides us now is the time to embrace the one
[15:51.840 --> 16:03.680]  thing that truly unites us you know what that is America America because what
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.960]  America is unified nothing is beyond our reach I mean that you're gonna see you're
[16:08.960 --> 16:14.560]  gonna see we're gonna have a country that was never so great you watch in so
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.960]  many different ways you hear a lot of talk about how we're becoming a
[16:19.960 --> 16:28.480]  globalized world but the relationships people value in this country are local
[16:28.480 --> 16:36.480]  family city-state country they're local we'll compete in the world we want to
[16:36.480 --> 16:41.320]  compete in the world but we're gonna compete in the world where it's a two-way
[16:41.320 --> 16:48.840]  road not a one-way road the advantages are going to come back to our country
[16:48.840 --> 16:58.120]  and they haven't for many many years there is no global anthem no global
[16:58.120 --> 17:05.840]  currency no certificate of global citizenship we pledge allegiance to one
[17:05.840 --> 17:11.800]  flag and that flag is the American flag
[17:11.800 --> 17:41.080]  from now on it's going to be America first okay America first we're gonna put
[17:41.080 --> 17:48.000]  ourselves first we seek peace and harmony with the nations of the world
[17:48.000 --> 17:55.160]  but that means recognizing the right of every country including our own to look
[17:55.160 --> 18:01.680]  after its citizens we would put other countries first we had people running our
[18:01.680 --> 18:12.000]  country that truly didn't know what the hell they were doing we're going to
[18:12.000 --> 18:19.640]  defend the American worker look what's happened right here they forgot about the
[18:19.640 --> 18:24.680]  American worker they forgot that it was the American worker who truly built our
[18:24.680 --> 18:31.800]  country we are not going to forget believe me one of the reasons we're so
[18:31.800 --> 18:38.400]  divided today is because our government has failed to protect the interests of
[18:38.400 --> 18:43.480]  the American workers and their families making it too easy for us to see
[18:43.480 --> 18:50.960]  ourselves as distinct groups and not unified as a whole we're not unified
[18:50.960 --> 18:56.800]  we're going to be Washington's politicians have spent so long appealing
[18:56.800 --> 19:01.040]  to competing interests they've forgotten how to appeal to the national
[19:01.040 --> 19:07.640]  interest come seeing the skills and talents of our people in a common cause
[19:07.640 --> 19:15.080]  and we have unbelievable talent but that is all about to change our goal is to
[19:15.080 --> 19:20.120]  strengthen the bonds of trust between citizens to restore our sense of
[19:20.120 --> 19:26.560]  membership in a shared national community global is wonderful but right now we
[19:26.560 --> 19:32.840]  want to focus on our national community never again will anyone's interest come
[19:32.840 --> 19:43.720]  before the interests of the American people is not going to happen again and
[19:43.720 --> 19:48.400]  over the last two weeks since our victory I've spoken to many foreign
[19:48.400 --> 19:57.160]  leaders and I will tell you they have such respect for us they all tell me how
[19:57.160 --> 20:03.720]  this was amazing they all tell me how they sat in their magnificent rooms in
[20:03.720 --> 20:07.120]  different countries throughout the world these are the leaders the prime
[20:07.120 --> 20:13.120]  ministers the presidents all of them how they sat in their magnificent rooms
[20:13.120 --> 20:19.120]  watching in wonderment and hearing how people came to vote that didn't vote in
[20:19.120 --> 20:24.720]  20 years people came to vote that haven't voted before and they had Trump
[20:24.720 --> 20:29.600]  shirts on and they had make America great hats on and they had buttons pouring
[20:29.600 --> 20:39.320]  off and they thought it was amazing and honestly one of them told me I truly
[20:39.320 --> 20:47.320]  respect the United States again because of what happened the president elect of
[20:47.320 --> 20:58.400]  the United States of America Donald Trump we have a lot to be thankful for
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.480]  with Mr. Trump a lot to celebrate the fact that globalism and political
[21:03.480 --> 21:07.720]  correctness is being exposed the fact that he isn't in an office yet an out
[21:07.720 --> 21:12.040]  carrier staying in Indiana for to stay in Kentucky and even apples talking about
[21:12.040 --> 21:16.200]  moving some of their factories back to the United States for the facilities
[21:16.200 --> 21:20.760]  they run in nightmare conditions in China yes I'm thankful for Trump and the
[21:20.760 --> 21:27.520]  march of nationalism from Le Pen in France to of course great leaders like
[21:27.520 --> 21:32.320]  Nigel Farage in the UK and Vladimir Putin in Russia human destiny is
[21:32.320 --> 21:37.680]  awakening I'm not just thankful for Trump I'm also thankful to God that we
[21:37.680 --> 21:43.280]  dodged the bullet that is Hillary Ronan Clinton
[21:43.280 --> 22:01.240]  so
[22:01.240 --> 22:03.240]  He died
[22:03.240 --> 22:27.240]  We came, we saw, we died
[22:33.240 --> 22:45.240]  It's not a laughing matter, I take it really seriously
[23:33.240 --> 23:52.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight here in the studio on this Friday, December 2nd, 2016. In the next segment, the bottom of the hour, we're going to have another report from Alex Jones talking about what's going on with this phony recount.
[23:52.240 --> 24:07.240]  We've seen now the very first results of this. As I point out, the top of the hour, Hillary Clinton has picked up one vote. She was 22,000 votes behind Donald Trump. Now she is 21,199 votes behind Donald Trump.
[24:07.240 --> 24:23.240]  It is such a massive waste and misallocation of resources as the entire Hillary Clinton campaign was that we see these articles from Democrat donors telling Losing Party that they're not giving anymore after it burned through their millions with nothing to show for it.
[24:23.240 --> 24:35.240]  And they're still burning through millions. And now we got Jill Stein joining in this vanity project that she has going on and also raising money for her own process there.
[24:35.240 --> 24:50.240]  This is absolutely amazing. And so Alex is going to break this down. Later on in the show, we're going to be talking to a European journalist, which I find very interesting because I didn't realize this connection yesterday when I talked about what happened on Wednesday.
[24:50.240 --> 25:09.240]  We had this report yesterday when I talked about it. They're saying that Russia weaponized social media. This is a narrative that's been put out by a cyber company that's not doing too well, actually a fire eye. But it was put out by Bloomberg and picked up by a lot of the news services that social media was weaponized by Russia.
[25:09.240 --> 25:25.240]  So if you retweeted that information that came out from WikiLeaks showing the criminal conspiracies within the DNC, within the Hillary Clinton campaign, the collusion between the media, the criminal actions of the Clinton Foundation.
[25:25.240 --> 25:32.240]  If you put that out there, it wasn't you passing along information about corruption. No, that was Russia weaponizing social media.
[25:32.240 --> 25:48.240]  And so in response to that on Wednesday, as we see this fake news narrative building, we had the American House pass overwhelmingly, it was 330 some odd votes to 30, only 30 against it, saying they're going to organize against fake news.
[25:48.240 --> 26:03.240]  The same thing happened exactly one week before in the European Union. You understand that the independent media is what is taking down. It's educating people. People are able to share this information back and forth on social media.
[26:03.240 --> 26:14.240]  We have independent journalists across the world that are exposing what's happening here. And as people wake up and see what the globalists are doing to them, they're revolting across the globe.
[26:14.240 --> 26:21.240]  And this is we had Gerald Salenti yesterday saying there's an election coming up in Italy. I mean, it's happening all through these European countries as well.
[26:21.240 --> 26:28.240]  And so what did they do? They pushed back and they say it's going to be Russia. The Germans have already said Russia is going to hack our elections. The same stuff we heard here.
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.240]  There's no evidence of that. Jill Stein says there's no evidence of anything happening. But I think we ought to look anyway.
[26:33.240 --> 26:41.240]  But she was never there when it came to voter fraud, when it came to electronic voting machine fraud. She never had anything to say.
[26:41.240 --> 26:48.240]  That's not what this is about. I welcome any efforts to try to correct that. What she is doing is not trying to correct it.
[26:48.240 --> 26:59.240]  She's just trying to interfere with this election. But understand that as the U.S. House passed this on Wednesday to come along with this fake news narrative and say we're going to do something about it.
[26:59.240 --> 27:03.240]  It's going to still go before the Senate. One week before, the European Parliament did the same thing.
[27:03.240 --> 27:11.240]  So we're going to talk to a journalist coming up in the second hour, Philippe LaRouth. He's from the International Federation of Journalists.
[27:11.240 --> 27:20.240]  And of course, RT interviewed him because they're in the crosshairs. They're being accused of being a propaganda organization. How do you define propaganda?
[27:20.240 --> 27:33.240]  Should we have a free marketplace of ideas? But you understand that it's no coincidence that this legislation was introduced in the European Parliament. And then one week later, the U.S. House put it in there.
[27:33.240 --> 27:39.240]  Because this is coming from the globalists. This is their pushback, their fake news pushback that they're coming against us.
[27:39.240 --> 27:46.240]  And as we look at what's happening with Breitbart, and this is something we need to really pay close attention to, we pointed it out yesterday.
[27:46.240 --> 27:57.240]  Kellogg said, we're going to blackball Breitbart. Sorry, saying that we're not going to have ads on their site.
[27:57.240 --> 28:09.240]  And so Breitbart came back and said, well, let's take a look at what their values are. Their values are, they are involved in child labor so they can get palm oil to stick in your sugar cereal.
[28:09.240 --> 28:20.240]  But it's even worse than that. On Infowars today, we see a story that Kellogg Foundation shares values with BLM, Black Lives Matter.
[28:20.240 --> 28:29.240]  It's a radical organization that they gave a million dollars to. So their values are not Breitbart, but their values are Black Lives Matter.
[28:29.240 --> 28:36.240]  So they're not even going to allow their ads to appear on Breitbart's site, but they will give a million dollars to Black Lives Matter.
[28:36.240 --> 28:47.240]  And then we look at this story here from WorldNet Daily. 47 U.S. companies are being pushed to join this Breitbart blacklist and push back against Trump.
[28:47.240 --> 28:56.240]  See this picture here? Does that look familiar? Okay, Black Lives Matter, the black fist, but of course we've also seen that in a white color for white power.
[28:56.240 --> 29:03.240]  We've also seen it in a red color for the communists. And the guy who's doing this has a Twitter account. He's an anonymous user.
[29:03.240 --> 29:14.240]  We don't know who this guy exactly is. He calls it Sleeping Giants. And he is attempting to take it down by taking screenshots of various companies that have advertised on Breitbart,
[29:14.240 --> 29:22.240]  put it on Twitter, and try to organize pressure against individual companies to blacklist Breitbart.
[29:22.240 --> 29:31.240]  This is a very organized campaign, folks. They're coming at us economically. They're coming at us legislatively. It is not just America, but it is Europe.
[29:31.240 --> 29:39.240]  We're going to talk to him, and also in the second hour, we're going to be talking to someone about a move against medical freedom in Texas, of all places.
[29:39.240 --> 29:46.240]  And it may be coming to your state as well. We're going to take a look at how that's being played out here in Texas. She'll be here with us in the studio.
[29:46.240 --> 30:02.240]  So stay with us. We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[30:16.240 --> 30:30.240]  We're coming to be the OSU attacker. Authorities are investigating an anti-U.S. rant posted on Facebook just minutes before the Ohio State University attack yesterday that is believed to be linked to a suspect named Abdul Razik Ali Artan.
[30:30.240 --> 30:38.240]  The post reads, I can't take it anymore, America. Stop interfering with our other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah. We are not weak. Remember that.
[30:38.240 --> 30:48.240]  He goes to show us how not-weak he is by driving a car into a crowd of innocent people where he steps out with a butcher's knife and starts hacking people up.
[30:48.240 --> 30:57.240]  That's right. You're not weak. You're a coward. And now you're dead. You brought a knife to a gunfight. You went to a gun-free zone and got shot down by one hero cop.

[32:18.240 --> 32:30.240]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[32:30.240 --> 32:33.240]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[32:33.240 --> 32:37.240]  We're the solution. Americans. Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[32:37.240 --> 32:49.240]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin. The ethical screenings on demand. DVDs now available.
[32:49.240 --> 33:11.240]  Blue, Revelation, the movie.info. Americans need to see this film. Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[33:11.240 --> 33:28.240]  I know you can see me now. Here's a surprise. I know that you have cause there's magic in my eyes. I can see for miles and miles.
[33:28.240 --> 33:48.240]  Alex Jones here reporting for infowars.com on the ongoing attempt by the Democratic Party that's controlled by an offshore consortium of large central banks and corporations to overthrow the will of the American people and steal the election for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[33:48.240 --> 33:58.240]  Now a lot of people think this is impossible. I've been warning for three weeks since Trump won the election that they would try something like this because they never give up.
[33:58.240 --> 34:05.240]  They were blindsided election night because they were attempting to steal the election and clearly stole five states from Trump.
[34:05.240 --> 34:19.240]  And all the election fraud that was going on, according to Bevera's, pointed towards fraud against Trump and the populist movement. So they were so stunned that they knew they couldn't contest it that night so they plan to try to contest it later
[34:19.240 --> 34:38.240]  or basically assassinate Trump or claim that he's involved in some sort of corruption. And they see this as a win-win. Even if they're unable to overturn Trump's election, which I still think is 90% improbable, they still believe they're winning
[34:38.240 --> 34:51.240]  because they're able to quote, delegitimize Trump and make it look like that he basically shouldn't be president ahead of a move to then try to impeach him or remove him down the road.
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.240]  So this is just all part of their war against nationalism and war against the people's will.
[34:56.240 --> 35:09.240]  Now that said, in FullWars.com, I'm very proud of it, and our reporters have been on the very cutting edge of exposing the fact that Jill Stein was only going after states that Donald Trump won, the fact that it was Democratic Party donors that were giving the money,
[35:09.240 --> 35:20.240]  the fact that internally they planned to discredit the election, the fact that they were planning to get 15 electors. We reported on this two weeks ago, 15 electors to not go for Trump.
[35:20.240 --> 35:34.240]  But they'll then use scandals that they're going to announce right around the 19th and the 20th to say the reason they're not going for Trump is because the recounts show anomalies and because Trump's racist and all the regular garbage.
[35:34.240 --> 35:52.240]  So they're just pre-preparing all of this for the public to at least try to dissuade the American people from continuing to push for Americanism, non-globalism and the restoration of our sovereignty and also further scramble and destabilize the
[35:52.240 --> 36:07.240]  inauguration that should be a celebration of the return of our national sovereignty coming up January 20th. So we've got all of that unfolding, all of that happening, and now Tucker Carlson, who I've really got to give credit to and I want to be clear.
[36:07.240 --> 36:22.240]  I mean, I think that Megan Kelly looks like a man in drag now. She's so unfeminine. She's quite frankly, so pretentious, so angry, so established, but so sycophantic. I can't watch her now. She's like Hillary Clinton.
[36:22.240 --> 36:31.240]  I have been basically conditioned to become nauseous when I see her face. And the reason I raise that point is most of the hosts on Fox make me sick. Bill O'Reilly, you name it.
[36:31.240 --> 36:43.240]  The only good shows are Fox and Friends and Tucker Carlson. And I don't say that about Tucker Carlson because, you know, he's a friend of the show and has come on the broadcast and we've had dinner before and he's a fellow patriot.
[36:43.240 --> 36:58.240]  I say it because he's the best thing on Fox now other than Lou Dobbs. And he's had the courage to really go where other people won't go on Fox now. And so other than Donald Trump coming on as a guest, Tucker Carlson is the best thing on Fox.
[36:58.240 --> 37:08.240]  And I think it's a very good sign that Fox realizes their coup against the Patriots via the election and via that made up stuff by Roger Ailes failed.
[37:08.240 --> 37:17.240]  And because that now failed, they're being forced because of ratings dropping to go back to more of an Americana based format.
[37:17.240 --> 37:31.240]  And I think Tucker Carlson being given a prime time slot now on Fox at seven o'clock Eastern is an extremely, extremely positive thing because look, Tucker Carlson six, seven, eight years ago wasn't perfect.
[37:31.240 --> 37:46.240]  Nobody is. But he just gets better and better. He's so articulate. He's so hardcore. And the reason I wanted to take some time out to single him out is the best thing on Fox is because we need to promote immediate period Patriots and give them support when they do tell the truth.
[37:46.240 --> 37:57.240]  And I think Lou Dobbs should be brought to main Fox. I mean, he's just incredibly smart, incredibly talented, incredibly patriotic, incredibly dedicated to this restoration of our Republic.
[37:57.240 --> 38:11.240]  But that said, the reason I raise him is I notice every day two or three times we have stories that we put out on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com where Tucker Carlson is just blowing it out of the water.
[38:11.240 --> 38:29.240]  I mean, he is knocking it out of the park with hardcore interviews that expose what's happening and it's good to see an hour basically of info wars style media on Fox every day because I'm not in competition against the bad drugs or Tucker Carlson or Lou Dobbs.
[38:29.240 --> 38:37.240]  I hope they become bigger than I am. I want to defeat the new world order. This is about restoring the Republic for my children and your children.
[38:37.240 --> 38:46.240]  Now that said, let's get to the latest piece of news. It's on info wars dot com from Tucker Carlson. The dovetails with Paul Watson's deep research.
[38:46.240 --> 38:56.240]  He had Sean Duffy Republican from Wisconsin on yesterday who has been inside the recounts happening in that state and others.
[38:56.240 --> 39:10.240]  And they have confirmed that it is the Democrats that are basically slowing down the recount on purpose. This is key slowing down the recount on purpose.
[39:10.240 --> 39:20.240]  So that they will be able to then say it isn't finished coming up on December 13 and then they won't be ready on the 19th to have the electors meet.
[39:20.240 --> 39:35.240]  The deadline is the 13th for that recount to be done. If it's not done, they can then just say that those electors do not go to Trump putting his election into question to put the country into turmoil and further destabilization
[39:35.240 --> 39:48.240]  within the Ford Foundation. And of course, people like George Soros have been pushing. So here's the article. Congressman Dim's stalling recount of Wisconsin to steal electoral votes from Trump.
[39:48.240 --> 39:59.240]  They want to use politics to undermine the will of the voter. Congressman Sean Duffy told Fox News, Tucker Carlson, the Democrats are trying to stall the vote recount in Wisconsin
[39:59.240 --> 40:08.240]  so that it not be completed before December 13 deadline, robbing down from the electoral votes of that state. And it's the model on other states as well.
[40:08.240 --> 40:16.240]  They're doing this. All of those in Wisconsin have to be certified by December 13 before electors meet on December 19 to formally cast their votes.
[40:16.240 --> 40:23.240]  Now, the reason this is so important is Jill Stein knows full well that she got Democratic Party donor money to do this.
[40:23.240 --> 40:32.240]  And she knows full well that she only picked five states that Trump won and that they thought was narrow victories, even though some states were 70,000 like Pennsylvania.
[40:32.240 --> 40:44.240]  They know full well what they're pulling is meant to overthrow this election. They know full well it's very nasty and very, very dastardly what they're up to.
[40:44.240 --> 40:50.240]  And when they sit there and claim that they're not trying to overturn the people's will, it's a fraud.
[40:50.240 --> 40:56.240]  They're lying all over TV, all over radio, all over the place saying this isn't the case when it clearly is the case.
[40:56.240 --> 41:06.240]  And this is the same Democratic Party that she's basically working for now that stole the election from Bernie Sanders in the primary.
[41:06.240 --> 41:12.240]  So more election fraud in front of us by these criminals. They're brazen. They're naked. They mean business.
[41:12.240 --> 41:21.240]  Here is a clip of that report from Fox News. And then we'll go back to David Knight from the Central Texas News Center in FullWars.com.
[41:21.240 --> 41:34.240]  Thank you all for your supporting prayers.
[41:34.240 --> 41:48.240]  All right, we're having a little bit of audio problem with that. So I wanted to follow up on what Alex Jones was saying. We've taken a lot of heat and of course they tried to attack Donald Trump by attacking Alex saying that we think that there was voter fraud here.
[41:48.240 --> 41:56.240]  We don't think. We know. We've had reports from multiple states about this, false voters. And we've also talked about voting machine fraud.
[41:56.240 --> 42:08.240]  We've had Bev Harris and others who have spent their entire career, not just one political party. We've had Democrats and Republicans who look at the integrity of the voting system talking about all these issues.
[42:08.240 --> 42:18.240]  And we were slammed as conspiracy theorists. Ten foil hat, all of this stuff before the election. And yet now they are using the same narrative as well.
[42:18.240 --> 42:26.240]  But I want to look at this story here from the Daily Mail. For example, they say Trump is right that illegal voting hit the presidential elections, say experts.
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.240]  And then they say, even if it wasn't in the millions, his critics have not proven that he was wrong.
[42:30.240 --> 42:44.240]  Now, what they say is that, you know, he's vilified, of course, and continues to have special reports put out attacking him by CNN for saying that he thinks that he won the popular vote because they've been padding the vote.
[42:44.240 --> 42:53.240]  We saw the vote totals continue to go up for like three weeks after the election was over from certain suspect areas, cities and states.
[42:53.240 --> 43:06.240]  But they pointed out that as CNN called it bogus, Washington Post said that pants on fire by Politico. But they said experts warned that the rapid media condemnation of the president-elect is itself flawed.
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.240]  And he was right at least partially. Well, let's take a look at what they say.
[43:11.240 --> 43:17.240]  And we'll go back to this clip. We've got that clip ready in just a moment. Let me just finish this report here.
[43:17.240 --> 43:24.240]  The 2013 study was conducted by a man named Jesse Richmond, a professor in Virginia, the Old Dominion University.
[43:24.240 --> 43:29.240]  It was based on surveys by the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies in 2008 and 10.
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.240]  They asked respondents for their citizen status, and then they just asked him if he voted.
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.240]  So these people say, yeah, I'm not a citizen, but yeah, I did vote.
[43:37.240 --> 43:44.240]  Okay, in 2008 and 2010, they just admitted it. Okay, how many people would be smart enough to not answer that question?
[43:44.240 --> 43:47.240]  Truthfully, you might ask yourself. And that's one of the key things.
[43:47.240 --> 43:53.240]  We talk about undocumented immigrants or the term even illegal aliens.
[43:53.240 --> 43:55.240]  Neither one of those terms really do it justice.
[43:55.240 --> 44:00.240]  Let's just say that they are citizens of a foreign country who were here illegally in defiance of our laws.
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.240]  And these citizens of foreign countries are voting in our elections.
[44:04.240 --> 44:11.240]  They say, based on that data that they took of that survey done by the Cooperative Congressional Election Studies of 2008 and 10,
[44:11.240 --> 44:16.240]  they saw about 6.4% of noncitizens voted in the 2008 election.
[44:16.240 --> 44:24.240]  So they said, well, that would probably get about a million or so of the votes that Hillary says she has, a 2.2 million.
[44:24.240 --> 44:33.240]  I say they don't know, because he's just estimating that 80% of those people would have voted for Obama against John McCain.
[44:33.240 --> 44:38.240]  So what is the estimate you think of these foreign citizens coming here voting against Donald Trump?
[44:38.240 --> 44:40.240]  And of course, there's more of them there.
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.240]  So that's the bottom line. This is not something that we can go through and say, this person, this person, this person.
[44:45.240 --> 44:53.240]  But when we go through and we see situations where false voter rolls are turned in with dead officials recognized in a Virginia County,
[44:53.240 --> 45:01.240]  a dead official there, we see the governor of Virginia robo-signing pardons for prisoners so that he can get 60,000 of them to vote.
[45:01.240 --> 45:05.240]  And guess what? She won by 60,000 in Virginia. What do you think? Isn't that interesting?
[45:05.240 --> 45:08.240]  Let's go to that clip of Tucker Carlson. We got that ready now.
[45:08.240 --> 45:09.240]  While the angry.
[45:09.240 --> 45:16.240]  I think everybody is in favor of recounts if there's a suggestion that the election was predicted, of course, and you should be.
[45:16.240 --> 45:22.240]  But if there's no evidence or even a suggestion of evidence that there was anything wrong with the election at all in the state of Wisconsin,
[45:22.240 --> 45:26.240]  how can there be a recount on what basis and who made that decision?
[45:26.240 --> 45:34.240]  Well, our law allows that even though Jill Stein got 1% of the vote in Wisconsin, if she raises the money and pays for the recount,
[45:34.240 --> 45:37.240]  she's obliged to get a recount from the state.
[45:37.240 --> 45:43.240]  Now, the counties have the option, do they actually use their voting count machines or do they do a hand count?
[45:43.240 --> 45:44.240]  Right.
[45:44.240 --> 45:46.240]  Well, virtually everyone said, we're going to use the voting machines.
[45:46.240 --> 45:52.240]  Dane County, the progressives that love Jill Stein and the Communist Party, they're the ones who said, no, we're going to slow-walk this
[45:52.240 --> 45:58.240]  and we are going to count by hand. And the projections that we have on the ground right now is that it'll take more than 20 days, Tucker.
[45:58.240 --> 46:04.240]  It'll put us past December 20th, which is the date these votes have to come in for the electors, which is the 19th.
[46:04.240 --> 46:09.240]  We won't have a certification in Wisconsin, which is their intent.
[46:09.240 --> 46:11.240]  We might have to use the courts.
[46:11.240 --> 46:13.240]  Interesting.
[46:13.240 --> 46:17.240]  Yeah, that's their intent to mess with the electoral college.
[46:17.240 --> 46:22.240]  See, this is, I think this is really tortuous interference.
[46:22.240 --> 46:25.240]  We got Lionel coming on in the third hour, so maybe we should ask him.
[46:25.240 --> 46:27.240]  He's a former lawyer and prosecutor.
[46:27.240 --> 46:29.240]  Is this qualified for tortuous?
[46:29.240 --> 46:34.240]  But it certainly is tortuous interference if it's not tortuous interference.
[46:34.240 --> 46:44.240]  I think that when you have a candidate who has less than 1% of the vote, she should not be allowed to be a stalking horse or a shill for another candidate
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.240]  who doesn't have the courage and the backbone to come out and show herself as a sore loser.
[46:49.240 --> 46:53.240]  And we know that Hillary certainly was sore on election night.
[46:53.240 --> 47:00.240]  And since then, we've had reports that she's been trying to drown her sorrows from an insider, but we don't know that for sure.
[47:00.240 --> 47:03.240]  But I wouldn't be surprised if that were true.
[47:03.240 --> 47:13.240]  But, you know, when we look at the debates and we look at third parties, and I think Jill Stein and I would say Gary Johnson have done a great disservice to the cause of multi-party elections that I support.
[47:13.240 --> 47:20.240]  In this particular election, the way the two of them have behaved, the way they have come across, but especially Jill Stein now.
[47:20.240 --> 47:28.240]  I think this has been even worse than Gary Johnson and his just not even being informed about basic issues.
[47:28.240 --> 47:30.240]  Looking totally stupid and irrelevant.
[47:30.240 --> 47:32.240]  We should talk about totally irrelevant.
[47:32.240 --> 47:33.240]  It's Jill Stein.
[47:33.240 --> 47:36.240]  Here's a person who has gotten less than 1% of the vote.
[47:36.240 --> 47:40.240]  She has absolutely no standing to do this, quite frankly.
[47:40.240 --> 47:48.240]  And I think that we ought to include people into the debates if they get on enough ballots, because it's very difficult to get on the ballots.
[47:48.240 --> 47:51.240]  That's, I think, a problem with our electoral system.
[47:51.240 --> 47:53.240]  It's very difficult to get on the ballots.
[47:53.240 --> 48:01.240]  But if you've got enough broad spread support to get on the ballot in enough states to win the election, or unless they set the bar pretty high.
[48:01.240 --> 48:05.240]  So if you're on the ballot in all 50 states, you should be allowed to participate in the debates.
[48:05.240 --> 48:14.240]  But I would say that we ought to have some kind of a rule to say that you're not going to do these kind of frivolous recounts just to interfere with the election.
[48:14.240 --> 48:17.240]  If you don't really have standing, if you don't really have a chance to win.
[48:17.240 --> 48:27.240]  Interesting that in North Carolina where there really is a very tight race and there really is evidence of voter fraud on the Democrat side and the gubernatorial race.
[48:27.240 --> 48:35.240]  You had the heavily Democrat County, Durham County, as I've mentioned before, extended their election for an hour and a half, and then at midnight they came in with 100,000 votes.
[48:35.240 --> 48:44.240]  And guess what? They completely flipped everything over from the incumbent Republican being ahead to the challenging Democrat.
[48:44.240 --> 48:46.240]  And there's less than 5,000 votes.
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.240]  Last time I looked at between these two and they're trying to do a recount in Durham.
[48:50.240 --> 48:58.240]  Meanwhile, these same lawyers, these same Democrat lawyers are saying, well, we need to shut down this recount in North Carolina. No, that's where it really needs to be looked at carefully.
[48:58.240 --> 49:06.240]  And they need to look at carefully at that one County heavily skewed, like four and a half times the number of Democrat votes to Republican votes there.
[49:06.240 --> 49:13.240]  The most you'll see anywhere else skewed to one party was two and a half times or 2.6 or something as I looked at the different counties.
[49:13.240 --> 49:18.240]  But in Durham County, heavily Democrat, they extend their hours, they mess with the election.
[49:18.240 --> 49:21.240]  And then when we try to do a recount, they say, no, we're not going to take a look at that.
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.240]  I want to move on from the election news to take a look again at this Trump carrier deal.
[49:25.240 --> 49:30.240]  Because as I pointed out yesterday, the devil is in the details. How did they do this?
[49:30.240 --> 49:36.240]  Okay, we've got the Mexican official really upset in the city where this plant was going.
[49:36.240 --> 49:39.240]  He says, this is a banana republic. This is a deal worthy of a banana republic.
[49:39.240 --> 49:47.240]  And I thought it was interesting, not that he said that, but I thought it was interesting that Yahoo News would put in here to try to say,
[49:47.240 --> 49:54.240]  look, Mexico's really not benefiting disproportionately from NAFTA against the U.S.
[49:54.240 --> 50:02.240]  Listen to this paragraph here. They say, Mexican economic growth averaged 2.6% in the 22 years since NAFTA took effect in 1994,
[50:02.240 --> 50:08.240]  compared with two and a half percent for the far wealthier United States, according to the World Bank.
[50:08.240 --> 50:13.240]  That has nothing to do with it. The size of our economies and how our economies have grown have nothing to do with it.
[50:13.240 --> 50:21.240]  It's really about the trade deficit. We had a rough parody. Some years, we would be ahead. Some years, Mexico would be ahead before NAFTA.
[50:21.240 --> 50:28.240]  So it was essentially a wash. We would see deficits of like, you know, plus or minus two to five billion dollars a year.
[50:28.240 --> 50:35.240]  As soon as NAFTA was passed, that trade deficit soared to 15 billion dollars, never went down less than 15 billion dollars,
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.240]  went up to 75 billion dollars per year in some years. That's the issue.
[50:39.240 --> 50:48.240]  Now, when we come back, I want to compare what the job stealer and chief Obama is still trying to do in his last 50 days.
[50:48.240 --> 50:55.240]  He's still trying to put chains on the American economy as we've got Trump, who's not even president yet, saving jobs.
[50:55.240 --> 51:10.240]  We're going to talk about that in detail when we come back.

[51:56.240 --> 52:04.240]  I want to tell you about a brand new Off the Grid product. It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[52:04.240 --> 52:10.240]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house,
[52:10.240 --> 52:15.240]  like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling. The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[52:15.240 --> 52:21.240]  It's mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[52:21.240 --> 52:25.240]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of Off the Grid electricity,
[52:25.240 --> 52:28.240]  basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[52:28.240 --> 52:31.240]  A true innovation. I have never seen anything like this.
[52:31.240 --> 52:35.240]  You're going to want to load up on these. One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[52:35.240 --> 52:39.240]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[54:02.240 --> 54:13.240]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host.
[54:13.240 --> 54:23.240]  As I pointed out earlier, we're going to have the former president of the International Federation of Journalists.
[54:23.240 --> 54:30.240]  He's been the former vice president of the European Federation of Journalists from 2004 to 2013, almost 10 years.
[54:30.240 --> 54:36.240]  Before that, he was president of the Belgian Association of Professional Journalists from 1995 to 2005.
[54:36.240 --> 54:45.240]  He's going to be talking to us about the developing censorship using this narrative of fake news and propaganda that is happening in Europe.
[54:45.240 --> 54:55.240]  It's not just here in America. And of course, one week after the European Parliament passed a bill saying we're going to push back and come after Russia because of their propaganda,
[54:55.240 --> 55:00.240]  we have seen the same thing get pushed through the US Congress on the House side.
[55:00.240 --> 55:08.240]  It still hasn't gone through the Senate. And as the Washington Post reports, it sounds just like it was a story written in Europe,
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.240]  effort to combat foreign propaganda advances in Congress. We're going to talk about how dangerous that is.
[55:13.240 --> 55:18.240]  This is a guy who's been a journalist for 61 years in Europe.
[55:18.240 --> 55:25.240]  And he's been president and vice president of the three major organizations there, currently president of the International Federation of Journalists.
[55:25.240 --> 55:33.240]  He's going to be talking to us in the next hour about this very dangerous situation as there's a globalist push against freedom of the press.
[55:33.240 --> 55:41.240]  Now, real quickly, as we're talking about freedom of the press, and we've talked about the Breitbart blacklisting that is being done by an anonymous Twitter user
[55:41.240 --> 55:45.240]  who's trying to create these blacklists, and he got Kellogg to sign on to it.
[55:45.240 --> 55:54.240]  Kellogg, who gave a million dollars to Black Lives Matter, but they're still pushing this and trying to get other companies to do this.
[55:54.240 --> 55:58.240]  We support our operation here with the products that we sell.
[55:58.240 --> 56:05.240]  And as I said yesterday, we try to offer you healthy things, things that will help you to recover, even if you eat Kellogg's cereal.
[56:05.240 --> 56:09.240]  You can recover with some of these nutrients and supplements.
[56:09.240 --> 56:18.240]  And I'm going to be talking also to somebody in the next hour with a statewide organization here in Texas talking about the pressure that is being put
[56:18.240 --> 56:26.240]  on tire practice, nature pass, and even people selling natural supplements here in Texas, going even beyond what the FDA does.
[56:26.240 --> 56:29.240]  So we have to fight for our freedom in multiple ways.
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.240]  One of the ways that we do that here at InfoWars is try to offer you the best products.
[56:34.240 --> 56:38.240]  A good example of this, I think, is DNA Force, which you'll find at infowarslife.com.
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.240]  DNA Force is a unique supplement.
[56:42.240 --> 56:51.240]  It's a compound backed by 175 clinical studies, very hard to secure, very expensive to acquire and to produce.
[56:51.240 --> 56:53.240]  But that's not all that's in it, okay?
[56:53.240 --> 56:55.240]  That's just one of nine powerful ingredients.
[56:55.240 --> 57:02.240]  It's got other things like CoQ10, digestive enzymes, transresveratrol, and many other things.
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.240]  But just one of these ingredients, BioPQQ, cost $30,000 per batch.
[57:07.240 --> 57:12.240]  This is something that if you read these studies, take a look at the information we have there at infowarslife.com.
[57:12.240 --> 57:16.240]  Take a look at the reviews, but especially the clinical studies.
[57:16.240 --> 57:18.240]  We back this stuff up.
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.240]  You can understand how important this can be for your nutritional health.
[57:23.240 --> 57:32.240]  And it is vitally important to keep us free and independent from corporate sponsors as we fight this move against freedom of the press.
[57:32.240 --> 57:34.240]  So thank you for supporting us.
[57:34.240 --> 57:39.240]  In the time I've got left in this hour, I want to talk real quickly about this carrier deal and what this shows us.
[57:39.240 --> 57:44.240]  Now, we see as the details emerged, we saw that, yes, there was some money given to carrier.
[57:44.240 --> 57:48.240]  $7 million by the state of Indiana, not by the federal government, not by the U.S. taxpayers.
[57:48.240 --> 57:50.240]  President Trump is not president yet.
[57:50.240 --> 57:52.240]  He's president-elect right now.
[57:52.240 --> 57:55.240]  So if you look at that, though, that's over a 10-year period for 1,000 workers.
[57:55.240 --> 57:57.240]  That works out to $700 a worker.
[57:57.240 --> 58:03.240]  That's going to be less than they're going to pay in taxes, not to mention the effect that it has throughout their community.
[58:03.240 --> 58:10.240]  But the interesting thing I think is when Donald Trump talked about this deal last night,
[58:10.240 --> 58:16.240]  he mocked politicians who offer low interest loans and tax abatements to keep factories in the United States.
[58:16.240 --> 58:19.240]  He said these companies don't even need the money most of them.
[58:19.240 --> 58:26.240]  And he said they take the money, there were a couple of instances where geniuses with great lawyers gave them money and then they moved away.
[58:26.240 --> 58:30.240]  You know what? One of those instances was carrier itself.
[58:30.240 --> 58:34.240]  Obama gave them green subsidies and they weren't going to close their factory
[58:34.240 --> 58:39.240]  because they didn't care about blue-collar jobs, only their green idols.
[58:39.240 --> 58:42.240]  Stay with us. We'll talk more about this on the other side of the break.
[58:42.240 --> 58:49.240]  For listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.

[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.240]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:19.240]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:32.240]  We're going to be talking to Philippe LaRouth, the current president of the International Federation of Journalists.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:41.240]  He has 61 years experience as a European journalist and he's going to be joining us to talk about this massive move against freedom of the press.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:47.240]  Labeling anybody that opposes a globalist agenda, calling them propagandists for Russia.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.240]  Same thing is happening in Europe that is happening here.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:59.240]  So we need to be aware that this is a global response to a global movement pushing back against globalism.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.240]  This is what Trump is about. It's what Brexit was about and we've got elections coming up this weekend.
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.240]  So he's going to be joining us in the next segment.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.240]  Real quickly, I want to go back to what I was talking about about this carrier deal.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.240]  I think it's very telling.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:16.240]  This Washington Post story that I was just talking about and I misquoted when I said, I read the quote from Donald Trump.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.240]  It was not what he said last night, but it's what he said in Pennsylvania back in October.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:26.240]  Talking about companies that don't need the money, most of them, he said they take the money, they got great lawyers, but they move anyway.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:28.240]  You're not keeping jobs in this country.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.240]  And so I don't think he took that approach and I'm going to kind of read between the lines here.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.240]  Like I said, he's not president yet.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.240]  I don't think he has the power to do that even if that's what he wants to do and I hope he doesn't want to do it.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.240]  But here's some hopeful quotes from him and some analysis even from the Washington Post.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.240]  I don't think he's going to attack it that way.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.240]  Let's say Trump threatens consequences for U.S. firms that relocate offshore.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:58.240]  Now they point out the president, like I said, more companies will decide to stay in the United States because his administration will lower corporate taxes and reduce regulations.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.240]  See, that's something that they're doing across the board for everyone.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:09.240]  So that means if you want to start a business, you get to have the same level playing field that all these other people are.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.240]  I don't like to see presidents who are picking the winners and losers like Obama has tried to do so much.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.240]  Because a loser like Obama is going to pick losers like he did with Solyndra.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:28.240]  But even though you got Donald Trump, who would do a better job of picking which companies are going to, we're going to back to say here, that's not the job of president.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.240]  The job of president is to get the chains off of us.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.240]  And we're going to show you how Obama, in his last few days as president, is trying to put even more chains on us.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  But that looks like that is what Trump is going for.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:48.240]  And as one of the people that they talked to at the carrier place said, we knew that Trump was on it, said the woman.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.240]  She said, he's not even in office yet and he's saving jobs.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.240]  Now they say, of course, this is Washington Post, so consider the source.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:01.240]  In fact, by Trump's own telling on Thursday, he has no plans to intervene in the carrier case until he watched an even news segment.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.240]  Featuring a worker who expressed confidence that the president-elect would save the Indianapolis plant.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.240]  Now, he did have intentions to do that.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]  He had announced that.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.240]  He was mocked by President Obama saying, what, you got a magic wand or whatever.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.240]  I don't think he had any plans to intervene until he became president, perhaps.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.240]  But when he saw that, I think it moved him on a personal level.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.240]  I've seen a lot of reports and I don't know Donald Trump personally.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:29.240]  I've seen a lot of reports surface after all these negative things they put out about Donald Trump.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.240]  About all the charitable things that he did to help people.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.240]  I think the guy really does have a heart.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240]  Look at the people who worked for him.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.240]  Look at his butler who worked for him for decades and how loyal that guy is.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.240]  So I think he really was moved by the plight of these people.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:48.240]  And I think as he's watching this, I think he got onto it and tweeted out on Thanksgiving, hey, I'm on it.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.240]  I'm working even on Thanksgiving to keep this here.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.240]  Now let's take a look in contrast to the way that Obama did this.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:03.240]  At this same plant, the same carrier plant, Obama gave them federal money from all of you who are listening.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.240]  All you Americans who are listening.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240]  You have a global audience.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:14.240]  But the Americans who are listening, $5.1 million in 2013 was given to the same company, to Carrier, to United Technologies.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240]  What was the purpose?
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.240]  The purpose was to create and maintain green jobs.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:23.240]  See, they didn't want to necessarily keep these jobs in the U.S.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:30.240]  And this is part of a $2.3 billion advanced manufacturing tax credit program known as the 48C program.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.240]  It gets a 30% tax credit.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:41.240]  See, the problem is Obama's focus was on promoting a globalist climate agenda, not on keeping American jobs.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240]  Okay?
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.240]  He wanted to sacrifice this money and he did to his green idols.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:55.240]  But at the same time, as he's ready to leave office, he's going to put a new EPA rule on us that will cost $1 trillion.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.240]  $3,000 is one time fee.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.240]  Or if you want to look at it the other way, $500 per person per year.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.240]  Last night, Donald J. Trump announced his pick for Secretary of Defense.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.240]  General Matt Dogg Mattis, U.S. Marine Corps.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.240]  Hoorah, devil dog.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:16.240]  Now we have a man who single-handedly went in and unf**ked Jifcom, which is Joint Forces Command.
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.240]  The idea that for a long time was very screwed up.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:26.240]  This guy walked in in the first day and wrote an email in all capital letters saying the holiday is over.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.240]  Well, guess what?
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.240]  Our military leaders have been on holiday.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.240]  Our commander-in-chief has been on holiday.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.240]  He's always playing golf.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240]  He's always going somewhere.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]  Well, guess what?
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.240]  General Matt Dogg Mattis is now in charge.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.240]  And guess what?
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.240]  The holiday is over.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:48.240]  He is going to get rid of all the people who are not part of the solution but part of the problem
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:53.240]  and restore our military to the superpower it once was.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.240]  This is a great day in America.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:06:21.240]  This has been Joe Bays with infowars.com.

[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:06.240]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:11.240]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:16.240]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride,
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.240]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.240]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.240]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.240]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:36.240]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.240]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.240]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:50.240]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:31.240]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:37.240]  Joining us in this segment is Philippe LaRouth. He is a journalist with 61 years experience.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.240]  He's currently the president of the International Federation of Journalists.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.240]  Before that, for nine years, he was vice president of the European Federation of Journalists from 2004 to 2013.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:55.240]  And for ten years, he was president of the Belgian Association of Professional Journalists from 1995 to 2005.
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:09:03.240]  The reason we're talking to him is because there is a worldwide push against freedom of the press going on right now.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:09.240]  Full court press. We've had the European Parliament come out, pass legislation one week ago, Wednesday.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:16.240]  The Wednesday before Thanksgiving Day, they passed legislation to combat propaganda that they said was coming from Russia.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:24.240]  Then, in the last, this week, we saw one week later on Wednesday, we saw, as the Washington Post put it,
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.240]  an effort to combat foreign propaganda advances in Congress. Isn't that interesting?
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.240]  And they used the National Defense Authorization Act that they're going to put this in,
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.240]  calling on the State Department to lead government-wide efforts to identify propaganda.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:45.240]  So they're going to tell us what propaganda is. We're not going to be allowed to decide that for ourselves.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:52.240]  They're going to tell us, Facebook and others, are going to tell us what real news is and what fake news is.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:10:00.240]  And that is a very, very dangerous situation for them to define what is real information and what is not real information.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.240]  But notice that this is being done now legislatively.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:09.240]  And at the same time, we saw a Bloomberg article come out this week saying that Russia weaponized social media.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:17.240]  So you didn't know that you were working for Russia when you started talking about Hillary Clinton's crimes as they were being exposed by WikiLeaks.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.240]  So I think we have him on the line. Do we have Mr. LaRuth on the line?
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.240]  Okay, we have Mr. LaRuth on the line.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  Philippe LaRuth of the International Federation of Journalists.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240]  President, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240]  No problem. Thank you. Good morning.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:41.240]  Good morning. Now, tell us what is going on on the European side because they are pushing against freedom of the press there.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.240]  This is something we've seen the London Guardian saying they think it's a very dangerous president.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.240]  We've seen Glenn Greenwald with the Intercept.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.240]  And of course, he was involved with Ed Snowden's leaks.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.240]  He said this is nothing but a new form of McCarthyism.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.240]  Tell us what is going on in Europe because this is a worldwide push.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.240]  Yes, you know there are tensions between European Union and Russia.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:13.240]  And the European Parliament passed a resolution but with a very controversial, you know, only 44% of the MPs voted in favor.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:21.240]  There was a high number of tensions fighting propaganda by Russia and Al Qaeda.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:30.240]  First reason to be surprised, associating a state with Al Qaeda, it doesn't seem fitting to us.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:36.240]  But naming Russian media by name, accusing them of propaganda.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:43.240]  And we found that it was not right to accuse them and not giving them a chance to defend themselves.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.240]  That was one point.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:52.240]  We consider you shouldn't find propaganda with propaganda but with ethical and responsible journalists.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.240]  Exactly. That's the thing that concerns everybody is how you define it.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.240]  We're going to have these gatekeepers who are going to tell us what real news is and what fake news is.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.240]  What real news is and what propaganda is.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.240]  How can we trust these people?
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:07.240]  In most cases, they work for the government itself.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.240]  They're going to be the ones telling us that things are propaganda or fake.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.240]  We know that they're going to label the things that are critical of them from experience.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.240]  We know that's going to be labeled as fake. It's going to be labeled as propaganda.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:27.240]  You know, we used to say, where do you find fake information on social media?
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:38.240]  And our fight is to distinguish between fake and honest information made of one thought, one other thought.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:44.240]  And you know, we have a sacred principle in journalism.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.240]  The fact is sacred, the comment is free.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.240]  You may not like the comment, but comment is free.
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.240]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.240]  And I think that's a very important thing.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.240]  I mean, the history of our country as it was being founded, we had a very high literacy rate.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.240]  It was much higher than it is now.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:06.240]  We had papers that were highly partisan, highly opinionated, and they did battle in the public space.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240]  Always in the past, I have always believed that everybody has a bias.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.240]  Just what you choose to report shows some of your bias.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:22.240]  So I have always preferred to find highly opinionated journals on multiple sides of the same issue and form my own opinion.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:29.240]  I think that's what a lot of people are doing with social media now, but they don't like to see this kind of open discussion today.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:39.240]  Now, on the social media, you have not the same kind of debate, but debate is, I express my opinion that yours is different and we debate.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:48.240]  On the social media, what we witness is that mostly the people look for people thinking the same as they do.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.240]  So this is us against them.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:14:01.240]  If that is really what we are trying to avoid, then we are originally in favor of debating.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:11.240]  Well, not everyone has to think the same way, and it's very positive when you have an exchange of views.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.240]  Yes.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:19.240]  And so the issue is to have more open discussion of views and not to have a gatekeeper who's going to do it.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:27.240]  And look at this legislation that is being proposed in both Europe and the United States to combat foreign propaganda.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:35.240]  And again, they identify the Russians always as being behind this, even though they don't necessarily have any support for that.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.240]  What are the specifics that have come out?
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:50.240]  I see this article here from RT saying that the European Parliament voted pass a resolution to respond to information warfare by Russia in a report written by Polish MP Anna Fotiga.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:56.240]  Sputnik news agencies were singled out along with RT as being among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.240]  Do they have any specifics of how they're going to implement this?
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.240]  Are they going to create their own counter-propaganda news media?
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:10.240]  Or are they going to try to suppress this? How are they going to try to control this and push back against it?
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:16.240]  First of all, this resolution of the European Parliament is not mandatory, so it's a resolution.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:28.240]  But when they say Sputnik is a propaganda tool, we would ask them to show us when and what's Sputnik a propaganda tool.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:34.240]  What information that Sputnik gave was a propaganda lie.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:48.240]  And as long as they don't give us concrete examples, we suspect that they are describing the media without demonstrating, proving this is a propaganda tool.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:55.240]  We are not naive. We know that the big states have propaganda instruments.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:03.240]  That's not the point. But please, when you describe the media as a propaganda tool, explain why and show us examples.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:11.240]  I think that's the key thing. When you say that somebody is doing propaganda or they're doing fake news and they don't talk about a specific incident.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:18.240]  And so a lot of times we will have people single out our organization and say, we disagree with what you had to say and we'll have a back-and-forth talk about that.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:25.240]  But when they do a broad labeling saying this fake and propaganda and this outlet over here, they do nothing but fake news.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.240]  So they attack an RT or they attack info wars and they say, you're nothing but fake news.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.240]  Instead of saying specifics about that. Yeah, that's the key thing, isn't it?
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:43.240]  How can you defend yourself when you have no concrete real facts to expose?
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:51.240]  If you're telling me the international federation of journalists is a liar federation, how could I respond to them?
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:59.240]  If you tell me this press release you issued, I don't agree with them. I can argue about this and we can have an open discussion.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:07.240]  Exactly. And that's the key thing. Now, as we look at this in the United States, I don't know how you feel about this because this is a worldwide.
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:14.240]  I've got an article here from Sydney talking about the U.S. election characterizing it as malice and misinformation and fake news.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:20.240]  Again, no specifics, always the generalities. But when we look at what's happening here in the U.S.,
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:29.240]  I'm very troubled by the fact they're putting this into the NDAA where we've already seen them insert things like indefinite detention by the military without trial or accusation.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:38.240]  That seems to be where they kind of put authoritarian movements or legislation in the United States and they're funding this and I don't know what they're going to spend money on,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:47.240]  but they're going to spend $160 million over two years, so $80 million a year to combat some generalized fake news.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:18:03.240]  Yes, and the problem is they have a financial means the media don't have in general. It's really worrying because, wow, we were told what to make the decision in the American election,
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:17.240]  that there were the social media. Second thing we heard, you know, in Europe, for instance, America is the West Coast and the East Coast, but the real Americans are between the coast.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:33.240]  It seems the media have not the means anymore to send people and to go in the little towns listening to what the people have to do to tell, and it is real journalism.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:50.240]  This is less and less the case and you have to react on the spot on news or fake news on Facebook or Instagram and so on, and we think ethical journalism is more needed than ever.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:59.240]  Yes, yes, and I think what is interesting, I think the two things that people need to take away from this is, number one, the charges of fake and propaganda news are very generalized.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:09.240]  They get specific about facts or about articles in most cases. So we see a broad based attack, but then they get very specific about individual news organizations.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:17.240]  So they attack Breitbart or they attack Infowars or they attack RT in various places, and we're seeing that here in America.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:32.240]  I want to take a quick break and when we come back, I want to ask you about your comments as we see a advertiser boycott being organized against Breitbart News, which was part of the anti-globalist movement here in the United States.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:43.240]  And of course, the former head of Breitbart is now the chief strategist for Donald Trump and the Donald Trump administration, so there's been a lot of pushback against them specifically.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:51.240]  We're trying to take them on a blacklist. We'll be right back with Philippe LaRouth.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:57.240]  Oh, okay, we're going to skip the break. Okay, so Alex wanted to jump in, and do we have Alex on the line?
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.240]  Yes, you do.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.240]  Okay, good. Thank you, Alex. Go ahead.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:13.240]  Well, I'm off and in here. I know I took off to take care of some business and I appreciate you filling in with a great job. I wanted to interview this journalist because I appreciated himself and his organization, which is one of those procedures in Europe.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:30.240]  Exposing the fact that these blacklists are very, very dangerous, and this is what authoritarian regimes do, like Communist China, is they come out and they say, oh, we're arresting all these people or we're finding these people because we say this is fake news criticizing the Communist Party.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:45.240]  The CIA, in the 60s, was to classify the 70s, created the term conspiracy theory to just discredit somebody and not address their info. That doesn't work anymore, so now they call you fake news.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:56.240]  They call info wars right-barred in the Russians. That's the three grids. All we do is bring on original documents, common-sense information, and lay it all out.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:07.240]  And that's why they hate us. We're bigger than they are now. Info wars.com, according to Quantcast, and according to all the other major services, is better than the New York Times online.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:15.240]  Our licorice ship is 40 plus million a week now. It is a new bottom. The high is 85 million. Those are real numbers. Okay?
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:38.240]  So that's what's happening. Donald Trump has those numbers. He knows that. They were delivered to him last week. So this is what's unfolding. They are crapping their britches because real citizen media, independent media, and also foreign media are now challenging ruthless western corporate media that has become globalists is destroying our national sovereignty.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:50.240]  And my big issue for the guest is we need to organize, as you were just saying, like with By-Mart against this, to have Kellogg's funding, George Soros, Color Revolution, Black Lives Matter, destabilization here.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:58.240]  Why he's done it in Russia? Why he's done it in Ukraine? Why he's done it in Europe's spring? And now Kellogg's comes along and says, oh, you're online advertising.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:11.240]  By the way, they had to buy into the consortium through that ad agency. I know the ad agency. They bought the placement there to then be able to pull it and create this tsunami of getting hundreds of other companies to pull it.
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:22.240]  Good. Please pull yourselves. Give us a list of people to shop with. I haven't eaten Kellogg's crap in over 20 years. It's the worst GMO garbage, as you said yesterday, David, eating a box of stuff.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:32.240]  So good. They want to boycott. They want economic war. They want to censor us. This is Black Lives Matter. That makes McCarthy look like an angel. This is out of control garbage.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:39.240]  I'm sick and tired of it. And so I'm glad that major journalists of organizations, even Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stones, Dr. Swipes, that is very dangerous.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:48.240]  Solana Guardians that is very dangerous. This is the essence of tyranny. This is failing corporate media trying to shut down all of its competition with labeling.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:56.240]  And they say here in the U.S. they want to have Black Lives. They've already kicked us off Google areas. They've already kicked us off Google Chrome.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:05.240]  They're already kicking us and blackboard off apps. We're already under attack. The censorship's here and we're so nice. We're just calmly sitting here taking it.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:10.240]  And none of us are even getting mad like we should. I'm going to sign off. God bless you gentlemen.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:21.240]  Thank you, Alex. Yeah, that's a good point because as we pointed out many times, conspiracy theory was a weaponized term created by the CIA to shut down any discussion of the JFK assassination.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:32.240]  They've used it against anyone that they want to shut down who is questioning official stories from the government. Now that term has morphed to fake news because it's just not getting any traction.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:43.240]  And we're talking to Philippe LaRouth. He is president of the International Federation of Journalists. He's been, as I pointed out, he's had 61 years as a journalist.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:50.240]  And he has served 10 years with the European Federation of Journalists. 10 years as president of the Belgian Association of Journalists.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:24:02.240]  The website is ifj.org. Mr. LaRouth, when we look at what's happening here in the United States, I find this legislation that just got passed two days ago here to be very troubling.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:11.240]  This $160 million that's going to spend over two years is going to go to the State Department to lead a government-wide effort to identify propaganda and counter its effects.
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:28.240]  Your comments. Yes, you know, legislations and nowadays, I mean also security legislations have very dangerous aspects for press freedom because, you know, intelligence are watching what is happening.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:42.240]  And once again, they might quote some comments, describe them as anti-national or so, even though they express an opinion.
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:49.240]  You know, we are with nothing, for instance, in Turkey. You know, there was an attempt coup in Turkey last July.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:25:02.240]  And ever since more than 2,500 journalists were dismissed. Hundreds of journalists were indicted. And all are accused of taking part to a terrorist organization.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:23.240]  If you are a Kurd journalist and you defend the Kurdistan independence, you are considered not a journalist expressing an opinion, you are considered a terrorist. And I really mean such legislations are very, very dangerous for free journalists.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:32.240]  And it's the hallmark of tyranny, isn't it? Every tyrannical regime will first move against free speech. They will physically arrest journalists.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:39.240]  But even before that, and we talk about the term conspiracy theorist that was created by the CIA, we all need to go back and you guys can look this up on the Internet.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.240]  You can do your own research, look up Operation Mockingbird. It was created by the CIA. What was the purpose of that?
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:55.240]  It was to identify and to control the media, to identify individuals and news organizations that they could control. And of course, in the past, in America, they had very tight control over the flow of information.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:02.240]  They had just three major television stations. Yes, go ahead. I thought you were-
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.240]  You are punchy.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.240]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Mr. LaRuth. Did you want to comment on that?
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.240]  Yes.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:22.240]  No, no, no, no. You are quite right. And I would just add a comment. As a journalist, I also say I have the right to make errors.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:39.240]  And the provided I correct them are those. But the legislation is used indeed to prevent journalists inquiring about maybe facts which could be very disturbing for the state.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:54.240]  And not only in dictatorships, also unfortunately, in democratic states, you see more and more of those legislations. And what you described in the United States is indeed very, very fine.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:04.240]  Yes, I think we should all be very concerned when we see our government spending hundreds of millions of dollars to identify propaganda and to counter it.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:14.240]  That's very, very amazing to see that. In a country where we enshrined in the very first amendment to protect individual rights, we talked about freedom of the press.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:23.240]  Because it is essential. As you pointed out, in Turkey and other places, it's a hallmark of a dangerous, oppressive, authoritarian tyranny to take the press out first.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:33.240]  And so this is where it begins. And we have to stop it before it begins. And I think it's interesting, Mr. LaRuth, as you're talking about this, we see this resolution that was passed in the European Parliament.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:39.240]  But we see actual legislation and funding a week later in the United States for the same thing.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:48.240]  And of course, this is a worldwide response from governments trying to protect themselves who have sold themselves out to the multinational global corporations.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:57.240]  Because as the people realize, this isn't working out for them. And as we see press stories about that, they have to try to take over that dialogue, don't they?
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:08.240]  You're quite right. This is a global phenomenon. And that's the reason why we have to build solidarity between journalists around the world to oppose this.
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:15.240]  And for instance, I find it very positive that you have now those conglomerates of investigative journalism,
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:27.240]  should not be attributing facts on the world, which no single journalist or no journalist of one single country could inform about.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:32.240]  And it might be a good answer to those efforts to silence repress.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:39.240]  Yes, yes. This is something that is very dangerous. And we really need to understand the global aspect of it.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:44.240]  Because we really are in a situation where I think that, as we saw Trump say yesterday,
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:50.240]  he said most people's connections are at a local level and they want to mix with each other at a local level.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:55.240]  And I don't know if I'm getting feedback there on the audio if you're trying to say something.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.240]  But you see that people want to organize on a local level. That doesn't mean that we're going to go to war with each other,
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.240]  just because we want to have our own local cultures and that sort of thing.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:09.240]  But that's what they're pushing against because they see that as a threat to their global agenda.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.240]  And the tools that they are now putting in place, these are being put in place by the same people who believe that they have a right
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:20.240]  to eavesdrop on all of your communications and to try to profile you as to your political beliefs.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:26.240]  And now they're going to weaponize this saying they're going to push back against foreign influences and foreign propaganda.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.240]  They will be the ones who will be defining it.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.240]  Thank you so much, Mr. LaRouth, and we will be in contact with who I hope.
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:38.240]  Keep us informed as to what's going on in Europe and the fight for the freedom of the press.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.240]  Dr. Mitchell, thank you. Good morning.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.240]  Thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining us again.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.240]  That's Philippe LaRouth, President of the International Federation of Journalists.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.240]  That website is ifj.org. It's a worldwide fight.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:30:12.240]  Well, Barack Obama is looking pretty stupid right now as a video has surfaced where he is seeing making fun of Donald Trump for promising to stop jobs leaving the country.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.240]  He's going to bring all these jobs back. Well, how exactly are you going to do that? What are you going to do?
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:21.240]  There's no answer to it. He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:26.240]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:30.240]  And usually the answer is you don't have an answer.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:37.240]  Well, Obama, President-elect Trump has yet to begin his presidency and he is already saving jobs in America.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:46.240]  And he has successfully negotiated a deal with air conditioner company Carrier to keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:54.240]  No magic wand, just good negotiating skills and a passion to put America first and save the working class hero.

[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:27.240]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:32.240]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:38.240]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:43.240]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:50.240]  I'm taking it now every day. This is so key. Biotrue selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:55.240]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price, exclusively available at infowarsleif.com
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:33:21.240]  or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:03.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:09.240]  In the last segment, we were talking to Philippe LaRouth, who's the president of the International Federation of Journalists.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.240]  Of course, he's got 61 years experience as a journalist.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.240]  He's talking about how the government is saying in Europe, and now we see legislation here in the United States,
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.240]  where the government is going to decide what is true and what isn't.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:29.240]  Well, in another way, and as Sheila Hemphill and Coleman Hemphill, who just came in here from another group,
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.240]  Texas Right to Know, we're going to talk about health information.
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:37.240]  And as she pointed out, we're just talking about the government defining what is true and what isn't.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:43.240]  Well, the government wants to define what is medicine and what isn't, what is helpful to your health and what isn't.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:48.240]  They want to make those decisions for you. You're not going to be allowed to determine what information is true.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:54.240]  You're not going to be allowed to determine what you want to take for your own health if we don't keep these people in check.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:58.240]  And I think it's very interesting when we look at Benjamin Rush, who was one of the founders of this country,
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.240]  one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:06.240]  And he said, if we don't put this into the Constitution, we will have a medical tyranny.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.240]  Of course, that hasn't really stopped him from trying to stop the First Amendment, Freedom of the Press,
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.240]  the fact that it is in the Constitution.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.240]  But he had this to say, and I want to read this before we go to our guests.
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.240]  This is Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence.
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.240]  He said, unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution,
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:26.240]  the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:32.240]  to restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privilege to others.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.240]  This is a guy who understood what was going to happen.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.240]  He was a physician. He knew what human nature was.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:42.240]  See, that's the key thing. Human nature doesn't change.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.240]  People always want to exert this power over others. So we're going to talk about how this is looking specifically in Texas.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:54.240]  There is a rally coming up to push back, I guess, an overarching government agency here in Texas.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.240]  You probably have the same thing developing to one degree or the other in your state.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.240]  And of course, we are all under the watchful eye of the FDA.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:12.240]  When we talk about the government, we talk about how the corporations take control of these bureaucracies
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.240]  that are supposed to regulate them. We call that regulatory capture.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.240]  Of course, that is always the issue. That's what Benjamin Rush was talking about.
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.240]  Human nature does not change.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.240]  So joining us now in the studio is Sheila Hemphill,
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.240]  founding member of the Texas Right to Know and Coleman Hemphill.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:27.240]  So welcome. Thank you for joining us.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.240]  And thank you for bringing this up to our attention.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.240]  Your organization is Texas Right to Know.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:40.240]  Tell us what is going on here in Texas that concerns you and tell us why you are going to have this demonstration.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.240]  What's coming up December the...
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.240]  December 9th.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.240]  9th, yes.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:53.240]  Every 10 years, there is an agency known as the Sunset Commission that goes in and evaluates the performance of various different state agencies.
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.240]  To see if things should continue.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:59.240]  Exactly. And most people don't even have a clue how our legislation works.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:04.240]  So you have your representative that everyone has a representative and a senator that represents them.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.240]  I encourage everyone to find out who your representative is and be in contact with them.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.240]  They make the laws and then they task an agency to make rules.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:16.240]  So that's where we can get into a lot of problems.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.240]  It's not even so much the law, but the rules established by, in this instance for medicine, is the Texas Medical Board.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:28.240]  And it's always that way. With the federal bureaucracy, we see that they had 80,000 pages published last year.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.240]  And of course, they set a new record this year.
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.240]  Those are laws, they call them rules, but they're really laws.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:41.240]  And so we've gone from a situation where we had taxation without representation to a situation where we have legislation without representation.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:47.240]  The legislature creates these organizations and these organizations want to create empires of their own.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:52.240]  And so they go out there, they write their own laws, they assess their own fines.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:58.240]  And then in the federal level, they say, well, it's not necessarily an excessive fine because it's not criminal, it's civil.
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:02.240]  And the prohibitions against excessive fines just for criminal stuff.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:07.240]  So they call civil asset forfeiture or you got the EPA coming after somebody finding them $80,000 a day.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.240]  And they say, oh, that's fine.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.240]  And then they've got their own court system and their own law enforcement of the laws that they create.
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.240]  And so we see this happening at the state level.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.240]  Tell us what is happening specifically with the Texas Medical Board.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:33.240]  The Texas Medical Board is going to be having their sunset review on the hearings are the 8th and 9th of December next week with public testimony on Friday, December 9th, starting around 9 o'clock.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.240]  And we're in room E1.030 of the Capitol.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:45.240]  Just visit Texas Right to Know and you will see the details of what the hearings are and the rally that we're going to be having on the south steps of the Capitol.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.240]  We'll start assembling it too with a rally from 2.30 to 3.30.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:59.240]  And this is an excellent opportunity for people to come and learn how to get involved because what happens at that Capitol determines the laws that we have to live under.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:00.240]  That's right.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.240]  So this happens every 10 years as a sunset.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:05.240]  So this is a very pinnacle time that we've got to get in here.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.240]  We look at the big picture.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.240]  We look at what's going on in Washington, but you need to understand that a lot of this is happening to us at the local level.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240]  What are they specifically doing?
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:19.240]  I understand that they are coming after some non-licensed healthcare practitioners, people like chiropractors, naturopaths and everything.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:26.240]  But also tell us about what they're proposing to do that is more stringent than what the FDA does in terms of supplements, for example.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:32.240]  Well, what we're seeing is when a complaint is filed against a physician.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.240]  The physician doesn't have a right to know who even filed the complaint.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.240]  It's a little better than it used to be.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.240]  They accept anonymous ones that no one even knew who filed the complaint.
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:48.240]  But it triggered what is called an investigative review conference, which is very costly, informal, excuse me, informal review.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.240]  Well, it's anything but informal because everyone has to law your up.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:40:02.240]  So even if it's a trivial, one instance is in chapter 164 of physician advertising rules that they are not to have anything that says false, misleading or deceptive.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:10.240]  Well, given that we're in an environment where the standard of care dictates all practices of the general population of physicians.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.240]  In many instances, they don't even acknowledge the significance of nutrition in health.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.240]  Yeah, exactly. Of course they don't.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:19.240]  No.
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.240]  Don't think the significant is the pharmaceutical.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240]  Exactly.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:31.240]  And when people do put out advertisements saying that nutrition or immunology or detoxification may be beneficial to your health, they are fined by the Texas Medical Board.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:41.240]  So if we want access to nutrition and education about nutrition from physicians, we want to learn about chelation and heavy metals and the impact that has on the body.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.240]  Detoxification from our physicians.
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:53.240]  We have to go to the Capitol and defend them because when they speak out and they put out information to inform people how to get better, they're slapped down by these medical boards.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.240]  That's just amazing.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:58.240]  That is so unscientific to say that you're not going to have an open discussion of this.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.240]  But we are going to determine and we're going to tell you what is fake medical news and what isn't.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.240]  I mean, that's where we're coming from, right?
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:14.240]  It always comes back to the gatekeepers who want to tell us not only what we can do, but what we can read, what we can think about, even our discussion they want to.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.240]  But now we're talking about the health.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.240]  Yes.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.240]  There's nothing more that impacts an individual than the health of you or your loved one.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.240]  It impacts your finances, it impacts your job, it impacts your future, it impacts your children.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.240]  And they're operating outside the Constitution and outside of due process.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:40.240]  So when they file a complaint against a physician and they don't know who is filing that complaint, that's a blatant violation of their Sixth Amendment right.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:49.240]  Then they come into these offices without consent from the patient or the doctor in violation of HIPAA law in the Fourth Amendment to privacy, taking people's medical records.
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:42:01.240]  And the environment that's caused has put a chilling effect through the small community of integrative and complementary doctors suppressing their right of free speech and their First Amendment rights to speak the truth.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.240]  This is like when we're talking to Philippa Ruth in the previous segment.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.240]  He said, the problem is that we need more information, right?
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.240]  We need to combat bad information with more information.
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.240]  People need access to this.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:20.240]  They're concerned that too many people who are just going to get together in little clicks and they're going to share information that they are able to believe.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.240]  But the solution to all of this, there's no perfect world, the solution to everything.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:33.240]  Even if you've got somebody out there selling something that is quackery or fraud, the solution to that is to put out more information talking about attacking that specifically.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:39.240]  We're talking about a thought police environment, which I find unacceptable.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:46.240]  There's no more subtle tyranny that is so complete in taking away your civil liberties than our medical freedom.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.240]  I mean, medical freedom and freedom for our doctors is the answer, and you're exactly right.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.240]  More information on what's beneficial and what's not.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:43:03.240]  We have this ruling coming out of Fort Worth that says the U.S. judge easily determines patients have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their medical records.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:09.240]  A private conversation between a patient and a doctor may be a thing of the past, and I don't think most people realize that.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.240]  You go in there and you have this stack of disclosures of all this HIPAA.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:15.240]  The Texas Medical Board say they are exempt from HIPAA.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:22.240]  Now, in this case in Fort Worth, they are coming into practices presenting themselves as a Texas Medical Board.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:28.240]  We want to see some patient records with two other people that never identified themselves, but turn out to be DEA agents.
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:33.240]  So, they don't have the right to know who the complaint is from.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:41.240]  In many instances, the complaints come from the insurance companies, and we just got back from a Texas Medical Board meeting at about 10.30.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:46.240]  And in this were multiple testimonies of patients with Lyme disease.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:57.240]  There are certain diseases that are almost untouchables in Texas because of the standard of care that is established by these societies.
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:44:01.240]  Well, what Texas adheres to is from the Infectious Disease Society.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.240]  It says, Lyme's hard to catch, easy to cure, all you need is a few weeks of antibiotics.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.240]  Well, that's not true.
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:18.240]  So, when we are spending $2 billion dollars leaving Texas to go get treatment, this father's son got a tick bite at a Boy Scout camp.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:28.240]  They have spent over a quarter of a million dollars seeking treatment because when it was even got the diagnosis in a Texas hospital, the head of the department walked out.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:29.240]  Wow.
[01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:31.240]  And that's money leaving the state.
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:36.240]  So, George Bush, when he was governor in Texas, said that over $2 billion around that time.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:37.240]  That's a lot of money.
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:45.240]  $2 billion was leaving the state of Texas for people seeking care that they didn't have access to in the state.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:48.240]  Well, this connects to so many different things.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.240]  We had David Simpson, who is a Texas representative.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:51.240]  Yes.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:55.240]  He pushed to allow medical marijuana to be used for certain instances.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:04.240]  And he was successful in getting it there because he showed that it was the only treatment that was viable for people who had multiple uncontrollable seizures.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.240]  And we know from many...
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:07.240]  Infectible epilepsy.
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:08.240]  Exactly.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:11.240]  We know from a lot of those are caused in terms of reactions to vaccines.
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:21.240]  As we know from the vaccine court, quote unquote court, that quietly operates and gives people compensation for injuries to vaccines that supposedly nobody ever has an injury to vaccines.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.240]  But as he was pointing out, you're talking about money leaving the state.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.240]  He had a couple of families that he talked about.
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:28.240]  And he said, look, they tried all the pharmaceuticals.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.240]  They tried everything that the conventional medicine would allow.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:35.240]  And so they went to Colorado, one family, and it saved their kid.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.240]  The other family couldn't afford to just leave their home and their job and go live in California to do that.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:51.240]  So they brought this in illegally and they brought it in at risk to their own freedom going to jail so that they could help their child who had this life-threatening disease.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.240]  It could kill them, but it completely destroyed their quality of life.
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:57.240]  That law you're referring to is referred to as a compassionate youth bill.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.240]  And it has parameters that you have to have failed two pharmaceuticals and have two...
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:08.240]  Is that really the legislator's responsibility to dictate how medicine is done or just to make things legal and then...
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:11.240]  What's your responsibility to make sure the pharmaceutical companies are taken care of first?
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.240]  So that's why you try all the pharmaceutical drugs.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:19.240]  And if they don't kill you and if you don't die from the disease that you're supposed to treat, then you can try something else, perhaps.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:26.240]  What's disturbing is when we look at the statistics from 2007 to 2013, the number of complaints have actually gone down.
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:39.240]  But the number of informal sediment conferences where everyone has to lawyer up and go down there and have their discussion to look at why a clause on your website or a flyer was deemed false, misleading or deceptive.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:49.240]  And then when a representative intervened for this position asking, tell me, what is false, misleading or deceptive, the response was, we don't get that specific.
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:51.240]  So that's unacceptable.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.240]  We know what's false when we see it, but we can't define it.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.240]  We have to have some parameters in the rules.
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:05.240]  And we know that we need to have good relationships with the Texas Medical Ward, with our legislators, but they need to hear from us.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:13.240]  And we need to have people show up on December night, start showing it to, and we're going to have a rally from 2.30 to 3.30.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:19.240]  And I encourage people to visit our website, Texas Right to Know, and click on Medical Freedom.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:25.240]  And from that website, you can be watching the activity. We have a bus coming from Dallas and Fort Worth.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:29.240]  And if we get enough input from the Info Warrior audience, we'll get buses.
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.240]  And we would love to bus you in from north, southeast and west.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:38.240]  Well, that's a key thing. You know, people need to understand when they look at things like mandatory vaccines and all these other issues that are forced upon us.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240]  I mean, this is how all this stuff comes in.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:48.240]  And we talk about the fact that they won't get into the specifics for a particular doctor that they're coming after, but they're just, that's what we're seeing in the news media.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:53.240]  As Philippe LaRouth was saying, they won't talk about specifics of a story.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:56.240]  They will just come after a particular news organization.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:02.240]  So they don't talk about necessarily specifics of a treatment or this type of approach and supplement.
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:10.240]  They will come after people who have a different philosophy or people who are from a different industry that are in competition with the industries that control these regulators.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:15.240]  That's why this needs to have a sunset that needs to be, needs to go away, doesn't it?
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:21.240]  Well, and we want this to be a precedent for all the legislation that's coming up in this upcoming session.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:28.240]  Because they will have, I believe, last session they had 18 different bills related to vaccines just in the state of Texas.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.240]  Yeah.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:30.240]  And so what I mean-
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.240]  There was a massive push on that.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:37.240]  It was just a couple of years ago that the pharmaceutical company said, we're going to stop doing any antibiotic research.
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.240]  And we're just going to focus completely on vaccines.
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:41.240]  And boy, have they.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:42.240]  Yeah.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.240]  I mean, just upping the number that you have to do.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:48.240]  And when you look at what's happened in California, we do not want that to happen in Texas or other states.
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.240]  And the way you do that is to get involved at the state level.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.240]  Because they're going to try to take this to the federal level.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.240]  Believe me, they're going to try to do it there.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.240]  But we can fight this at the state level.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.240]  You know, Donald Trump talked about America not winning anymore.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.240]  We don't cure anymore.
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.240]  We're 49th in the world in medical outcomes and life expectancy.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:11.240]  So when people get a diagnosis, they're destined for a life of constantly being treated.
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.240]  We don't cure people anymore.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.240]  We have the 30th in the world for infant mortality rate.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:19.240]  One in two people now will have cancer in their lifetime.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:21.240]  One in four have diabetes.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.240]  And there's been an exponential increase in almost all of your neurological diseases really over the last 15 to 20 years.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.240]  So the environment and the standard of care has failed.
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:36.240]  And what do we do for all of those patients that aren't serviced by the standard of care?
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:43.240]  Here was a doctor who was treating chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia that I'm sure many of your audience know people who suffer
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.240]  from a very painful diagnosis of unknown origin in many times.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:49.240]  He got a complaint.
[01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:53.240]  The patient assumed he was distributing too many supplements or pills or something.
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:57.240]  They came in and won a problem with the supplements or the medication.
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.240]  But they found that he was giving a lidocaine drip that was non-narcotic
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.240]  and would enable people to have pain relief for four to six weeks.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.240]  Okay, here's a big problem.
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:18.240]  Is it these complementary and integrative doctors who are practicing under Title 22, Part 9, Chapter 200 of the Texas Administrative Code,
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.240]  which is Standards for Physicians Practicing Complimentary and Alternative Medicine.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:25.240]  We have the law.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:30.240]  When they came in, there wasn't a problem with the pills.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.240]  But when they found this lidocaine drip, a pulmonologist along doctors said,
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.240]  lidocaine, what do you mean you're doing the lidocaine drip?
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.240]  You can't do that.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.240]  And the doctor goes, well, okay, I'll stop.
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:45.240]  But I'm one of 15 networks around the nation that routinely give this for fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:47.240]  There needs to be more information.
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:50.240]  We need to have a marketplace and hopefully we're going to see something like that happen.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:57.240]  The standard of care he got cited for not following for chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia was graded exercise and psychiatric evaluation.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:58.240]  Wow.
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:50:59.240]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.240]  We're going to talk about health freedom.
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.240]  Tom.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:01.240]  Katie Armour raised the standard.

[01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:12.240]  Unique design, distribute weight, feeling lighter, increases mobility and lessens fatigue.
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:19.240]  Introducing the Combat Quad Bend CQB, a revolutionary plate forming process that caters to the end user.
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.240]  The CQB is an industry game changer, a must have for the ladies.

[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.240]  Come and take it.

[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:25.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and I'm here with Sheila Hemphill and Coleman Hemphill.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:33.240]  They are founding members of the Texas Right to Know as a coalition to give you information about your health.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:38.240]  You have a right to know about your health just as you have a right to know about politics.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.240]  That's what we've been talking about this entire hour.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:46.240]  We started out talking to Philippe LaRouth who is president of a European organization,
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:48.240]  International Federation of Journalists.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:51.240]  I think it's more than Europe, but he has worked for 61 years there.
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:55.240]  They're trying to shut down and define for us what we can say.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.240]  Labeling things as fake and the same thing as being done with your health information.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:06.240]  I was just looking at this article from the Daily Mail and they said Parkinson's could start in the gut, not in the brain.
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:14.240]  They've done a study here with mice and they saw that if they have gut health problems, how many times have we seen this?
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:19.240]  We've seen Dr. Group come on again and again saying, talking about the importance of gut health,
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:21.240]  and now we're finally seeing them do some studies.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:27.240]  They just completely ignore the issues of nutrition, the issues of probiotics for the longest time,
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:30.240]  and now they can't ignore that anymore.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:36.240]  So we've had nature paths that are doing that, but they're the types of people who are being targeted now in the state of Texas.
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.240]  And that's one of the reasons why we sell the products that we do.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:45.240]  I'll just do a quick plug here for biome defense because we're going to talk about probiotics that are going to get your gut healthy.
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:50.240]  Maybe you didn't realize that might even a healthy gut is going to make a difference in Parkinson's.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:58.240]  I say, of course, you do have genetic issues, but there's also these epigenetic issues that are there that are focused on your nutrition.
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:02.240]  Also, vitamin mineral fusion drink mix is back at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.240]  That's our affordable, great tasting vitamin mineral fusion drink mix.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:07.240]  It's back at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.240]  It gives you a full month supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:16.240]  So nutrition is a very important part of your health.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:22.240]  Do that before you resort to very dangerous, very expensive pharmaceutical drugs.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:29.240]  And it's the government that is working with the pharmaceutical industry to make sure that you don't do this and trying to shut this down.
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.240]  And that's exactly what we're talking to the hemp hills from the Texas Right to Know About.
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:37.240]  They want to get a sunset law on this organization here in Texas, the Texas Medical Board.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:44.240]  One of the things you were telling me during the break was the lack of qualifications that are required for people setting on the Texas Medical Board,
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:52.240]  as they set in judgment of other people's medical advice and shutting down the free flow of information about nutrition as well as the effects of drugs.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.240]  They don't have any integrative and complementary training.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:03.240]  They don't have any training or understanding of chiropractors that they're trying to take over that license ship.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:10.240]  So, just like the mainstream media, they constantly is going after, they paint a completely different narrative.
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:19.240]  They subscribe to their own schools of thought, they have no understanding, and so they prosecute very quickly many of these doctors.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:30.240]  And yet, in the rules, it specifically says that 200, rule 200.3 from the chapter 200,
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:37.240]  a license physician shall not be found guilty of unprofessional conduct or be found committing professional failure to practice medicine
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:44.240]  in an acceptable manner solely on the basis of employing a healthcare method of complementary alternative medicine.
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.240]  So, when they say it's not about the method, but it really is about the method as we see it being enforced.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:55.240]  Well, it is because they're being evaluated by the standard of care, not the standards outlined in chapter 200.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:59.240]  Now, everyone needs to really pay attention what's happening with the chiropractors.
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:09.240]  The Texas Medical Association, not the board, but a professional association, TMA, is suing, and it's in appeal right now,
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:13.240]  to prevent chiropractors the ability to do a diagnosis.
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:18.240]  So, if you can't do a diagnosis, you can't bill insurance because you have to have a diagnosis to be able to bill insurance.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:23.240]  That's amazing, that's amazing. And of course, I know chiropractic very well, my brother-in-law is a chiropractor.
[01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:31.240]  When he was in college in Iowa, he said, we love to have the people who come to us who have had all these things they've tried with medical issues
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:35.240]  and they failed and they come to us last and we fix it. So, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:53.240]  And again, that's the Texas Right to Know, you have a right to know.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:59:09.240]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America, he's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:23.240]  He never wondered what happened to America.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:29.240]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:51.240]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:51.240 --> 02:00:01.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:15.240]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:19.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host. We're going to be talking to Lionel.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:27.240]  Coming up in the next segment, it'll be interesting to get his take on these events that have been taking place since the election.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:35.240]  Last time we talked to Lionel, I think was the night of the election and he and I were talking about how interesting the Trump campaign was
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:40.240]  and how things just didn't work to attack him because everybody understood that he was authentic.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.240]  So, whether you agreed with him or not, whether he had rough edges or not, you realize that he was authentic on this.
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:51.240]  And I think it's going to be interesting. We certainly have seen him do his own thing even after becoming elected president.
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:57.240]  We've never seen a president go out and do a victory tour thanking the people that elected him because he went over the heads of the establishment,
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:05.240]  both press and political, and also to be proactive to go out and to save jobs.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:15.240]  I've pointed out for eight years, Obama hasn't saved a single factory. Instead, what he has done is misallocate taxpayer money in a kind of crony capitalism way.
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:25.240]  And as I pointed out earlier in the show, this issue with EPA rules and regulations and understand that even though he's already surpassed the record number of new regulations by a bureaucracy,
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:30.240]  that's legislation without representation, folks, even though he's already accomplished that.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.240]  He's already in the Guinness Book of Records as regulator in chief. He's not done yet.
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:42.240]  And he's pushing for a lot more regulations before the end of the year. Just the top 100 of those will be about $2 billion in additional regulation.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:50.240]  But look at this new EPA rule. It's going to push regulatory costs past $1 trillion over a 10-year period. Isn't that amazing?
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:56.240]  A trillion dollars of regulations change that he is putting on this economy.
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:03.240]  That's what Obama has done through his entire regime. They say a new implementation of EPA rules, this is from the Washington Examiner,
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:12.240]  on heavy trucks has boosted the 10-year regulatory burden on America past a trillion dollars, 75% of which have been imposed by the Obama administration.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:24.240]  If this can go through, this is a one-time charge of $3,000 per person, or if you take it at an annual rate, that's $540 per man, woman, and child.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:32.240]  Think about that when you look at some of the libertarian organizations criticizing what happened with the Indiana government.
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.240]  And of course, it's not the federal government. It didn't give any subsidies to Carrier.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:40.240]  They say, well, Indiana shouldn't have given $700 per person per job there.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.240]  Now, that is not $700 coming from each citizen of Indiana.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:53.240]  That is $700 that is going to Carrier for those people's positions, except that Carrier is coming in with two and a half times that amount to invest.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:03:00.240]  And those people whose jobs they're paying $700 per job to keep, those people are going to pay far more than that in tax.
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.240]  They're going to have a massive impact on the economy there.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:11.240]  And yet, we've got Obama, $500 per man, woman, and child across the United States just for this one EPA regulation.
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:13.240]  It's just absolutely amazing what they're doing.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:24.240]  And as we've talked in this last hour, we talked to Philippe LaRouth from the European journalist that is talking about the push in Europe to shut down what they call fake news or propaganda.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.240]  And of course, they're going to determine what is fake, what is propaganda.
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:30.240]  And they're saying, this is coming from the Russians. We've got to be careful.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.240]  They're going to ruin our elections in Germany, just like they did in America.
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.240]  No, there's no evidence of that. There's no evidence they were behind the hack at the DNC.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:44.240]  And they don't talk about the specifics. But let's talk about all this red baiting, all this red scare stuff.
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.240]  We've got an article here from The New York Times.
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:52.240]  A subdued Vladimir Putin calls for mutually beneficial ties with the U.S.
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.240]  They used to call that detente. They used to call that a good thing.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:59.240]  Until we had Obama and Hillary say, we're going to have a Russian reset.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:00.240]  And what they did was reset the Cold War.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:08.240]  He said that he wanted to normalize and begin to develop bilateral relations on an equal and mutually beneficial basis with the United States.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:16.240]  And The New York Times says that Putin's comments largely reprise the message he gave Mr. Trump in a telephone call soon after the election
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:24.240]  when both men agreed that something needed to be done to improve, quote, the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:27.240]  That had been created by Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.240]  Let's just put that footnote in there for The New York Times, since they won't tell you that.
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:38.240]  They say, in a departure from his speeches in recent years, Mr. Putin avoided sarcastic or downright angry comments about the United States.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:49.240]  But he also made it clear that Russia demanded to be treated with respect as a global power, not as a regional power that Mr. Obama described it in 2004, which infuriated Moscow.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.240]  See, even the rhetoric was inflammatory that they've done.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:57.240]  Now, stay with us. We're going to be right back. We're going to talk to Lionel.
[02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:32.240]  People that in this country are local, family, city, state, country, they're local.
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:41.240]  There is no global effort, no global currency, no certificate of global citizenship.
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:54.240]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:06:13.240]  And you can watch this speech in its entirety right now and at FullWars.com.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:28.240]  Basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:31.240]  A true innovation. I have never seen anything like this.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:33.240]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.240]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:40.240]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:05.240]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:08.240]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:14.240]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:20.240]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.240]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:25.240]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:29.240]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:32.240]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:34.240]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:37.240]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:40.240]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:41.240]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:44.240]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:45.240]  I take this.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:46.240]  This is the product that I take.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:51.240]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make, we fight the global, we fight the new world order.

[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:24.240]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:24.240 --> 02:08:27.240]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:37.240]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:39.240]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:43.240]  And joining us now is an Emmy Award-winning TV as he puts it,
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:46.240]  News Decoder and Legal Analyst, Lionel.
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:49.240]  He's a licensed trial lawyer and a former prosecutor.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:56.240]  You can find him on Lionelmedia.com as well as on Twitter at Lionelmedia is his Twitter handle.
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:01.240]  And I see him clapping there on the monitor to the music and enjoying the music there.
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:06.240]  I want to talk to Lionel about what's happened after the election.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:08.240]  Of course, we've got a lot of interesting things.
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:11.240]  In the last hour, I don't know if you heard the broadcast Lionel,
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:16.240]  but I was talking to the president of a European Journalist Association.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:18.240]  He's got 61 years of journalism there.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:22.240]  He's concerned about the global push against free speech.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:26.240]  We heard Donald Trump say yesterday that there's no global flag,
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:28.240]  no global currency, no global citizenship,
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:31.240]  but there is a global pushback against freedom of the press.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.240]  So I want to get your comments on that.
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:34.240]  Thank you for joining us, Lionel.
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:36.240]  Oh, gosh.
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:42.240]  I haven't spoken with you since the miracle.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:43.240]  That's right.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.240]  I mean, for lack of a better word.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:46.240]  Since the US changed.
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:48.240]  I want to tell you something.
[02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.240]  The music on this show is tremendous.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:52.240]  Gypsy Kings.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:55.240]  My theme song for yours is Nina Morena.
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:57.240]  So this is from Mosaik.
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.240]  So tell your crew you'll know why that particular song is my favorite.
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.240]  But look, you know, you know, David, I don't even know where to start with this.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:14.240]  And let's just, if I could, just start from something that makes me so thrilled.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:23.240]  Donald Trump has acted as the potentiator to a form of psychosis and insanity.
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:25.240]  That was always possible.
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:31.240]  But just like alcohol potentiates the effects of some drugs and heightens it.
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:37.240]  Donald Trump has made the world insane.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:43.240]  Every aspect and the mainstream media do not know what to do.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:45.240]  Let me just stop for one second.
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:57.240]  What you and Alex and Paul and Leanne and Joe Biggs, I mean, what everybody did was so monumental.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:59.240]  What Roger Stone did.
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:06.240]  What this is not even, you know, not that you're the guerrilla force behind it.
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:09.240]  You replaced the mainstream media.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:10.240]  You're now mainstream.
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:12.240]  They're fringe.
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:14.240]  And they don't know what to do.
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.240]  Oh, I think they do.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:20.240]  They're trying to push back and say, you guys are fake and we're going to find what is real and what isn't.
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.240]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:28.240]  They're going to spend $160 million over two years to have the State Department determine what is propaganda and what isn't.
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:32.240]  I mean, this is taking fake news to an amazing authoritarian level.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:37.240]  The attack against the people, as you point out, who worked with Donald Trump,
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:41.240]  who educated the public about what globalism was about and who are a part of this victory.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.240]  They want to shut that down.
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:45.240]  They want to shut down that information.
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:47.240]  Well, this is great.
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:50.240]  Now, first, I just, I don't even know where to start.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:51.240]  Fake news.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:52.240]  Okay.
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.240]  When they didn't like one particular story that was being advanced.
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.240]  When I say they, I think we know who they are.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:00.240]  They are either the ruling class or whoever.
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:02.240]  They called it a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.240]  That wore thin because those things kept turning out to be true.
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:12.240]  Those conspiracy theories never were fake conspiracy theories.
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:19.240]  They just said conspiracy theory without specifying false ones versus true ones.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:27.240]  So they said, you know, we need something new and some Orwellian dystopian, you know, vocabulary, some argument.
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:28.240]  You know, what can we use?
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:32.240]  Ah, fake news, rather base, but rather clear.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:39.240]  Now, if you look at one of the things which I found, and I don't want to go into this, but just to give you an idea.
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:43.240]  When pizza gate came up, and again, I don't want to go into that.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:53.240]  But I just want to give you an idea of how this, the BBC came up with a story that said, this is nonsense.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:54.240]  Okay.
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.240]  So I guess they give it the F for fake news.
[02:12:56.240 --> 02:12:57.240]  This is fake.
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:05.240]  Now, I wanted to respond with yes, but you were the one who covered up pedophilia from Jimmy Savile.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:07.240]  So I'm going to double back at you.
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:08.240]  So now you're fake.
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:09.240]  Okay.
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:10.240]  Let's stop that.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:12.240]  Let's use this one propaganda.
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:13.240]  Yeah.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:21.240]  The Vatican, the Pope, Pope Gregory, whatever, from propaganda, you know, the propagation of the truth.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:22.240]  Okay, fine.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:26.240]  Propaganda means something that is not true.
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:29.240]  Because if propaganda is the truth, we don't call it propaganda.
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.240]  We say, well, it's the truth.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.240]  Okay.
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:41.240]  Propaganda means kind of an unwarranted, unspecified, unvalidated form of hyper, you know, support of a particular idea or theory,
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:47.240]  which is nice, but we just went through an entire election of propaganda.
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:55.240]  So I don't want to be crude, but the size of these appendages that they have are elephantine.
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:56.240]  Okay.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:57.240]  Now, so they don't know what to do.
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:01.240]  So then they turn around and say, well, let's scrap that.
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:02.240]  Let's do this.
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:07.240]  Let's create a word, create a vector, and then jump on it.
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:08.240]  Whoever it is, raise your hand.
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:09.240]  Okay.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:10.240]  Washington Post.
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.240]  Start off.
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:12.240]  Trump is a racist.
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:13.240]  No, we can't do that.
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:14.240]  Why?
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.240]  Wow.
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:16.240]  We've been using that.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:17.240]  We've habituated people to that.
[02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:19.240]  Somebody else, New York Times, HuffPost.
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  How about white supremacists?
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.240]  Oh, I like that.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:24.240]  That's got some style to it.
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:25.240]  Anybody in particular?
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:26.240]  Steve Bannon.
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.240]  Oh, Bannon.
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.240]  And he's an anti-Semite.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:33.840]  Lionel, did you see what CNN did to Alex Jones, putting his face up on the screen and then
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:38.240]  putting underneath it, former KKK leader, and then underneath that, lower two-thirds.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:42.840]  But Alex Jones, and for worse, I mean, they labeled him, literally labeled him on the screen
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:45.240]  as a former KKK leader.
[02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:51.720]  Now, New York Times, again, Sullivan, not withstanding, and it will be tough.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.240]  And I know Alex, my God.
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:55.840]  I think this guy sued everybody.
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:00.840]  He would have a separate division of, he did a law firm, just to go after, but...
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.240]  You could go back into practice.
[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.240]  Yeah.
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:06.240]  Oh, well, I still practice now, but that's okay.
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:09.240]  I wouldn't need a factory to handle just the paperwork.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:10.240]  Yeah.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:15.040]  But do you understand the absolute, first of all, the genius of that, because Alex and
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:21.520]  Drudge and others, you know, just when people try to say, oh, these fringe platform people,
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:26.280]  they don't know what, they're conspiracy, they're crazy, you're exploding.
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:34.680]  So what happens is, you're seeing this recalculated, and what's happening is simply this.
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:41.600]  What Bannon and others know is that when you are at war, and you know the old expression
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.280]  if you can only tell you're over the target when you catch flag, but when your enemy
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:54.440]  is firing in the wrong direction and aiming at the wrong part, the wrong area, don't correct
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:55.440]  him.
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:56.440]  Let him use their ammo up.
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:01.240]  So if I were Bannon and Trump and everybody else in Kellyanne Conway and you name it,
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:08.120]  and Alex, let them keep these sorties, these fusillades up because it's going to habituate
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.120]  people to it.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:13.760]  It's going to waste their time while you proceed forward.
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:20.880]  And what this is, is there is a subdirectory of this, and that is the informational, the
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.800]  sense of what is reality.
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:25.680]  You know, in medical school, somebody said one time a friend of mine who was a doctor
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:30.280]  said the question they asked was, how do you know what you know?
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:31.280]  How do you know this?
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.280]  So my question...
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.280]  Sounds like Rumsfeld.
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.280]  Yes, right.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:40.960]  The knowns and unknowns and the democracies messy, and you go to war with the army you
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:44.680]  have and, oh, those beauts, we laughed at those, didn't we?
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:46.200]  We don't keep dying.
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:51.880]  So what we're having right now is, David, only a man of your robbing nagging and intellect
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:53.080]  can understand this.
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:58.840]  This is just incredible how complicated a plain old election was.
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:01.200]  That man hasn't even been sworn in.
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.400]  And what does he do?
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:06.000]  He has the carrier, but he's stay.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.000]  He...
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.080]  I mean, this is almost like a Logan Act violation.
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:11.640]  How does he even negotiate?
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:12.960]  He's a private citizen.
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:19.400]  Meanwhile, you've got Obama in these videos who, when Obama doesn't know what to do, two
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:20.400]  things happen.
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:27.400]  He stutters profusely, and as a stutterer, I myself, I can understand that, but also
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:28.640]  he becomes very southern.
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:31.440]  And he says, now what am I supposed to do?
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:32.440]  See?
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:33.440]  I mean, how am I?
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:35.560]  He becomes Jerry Clow or all of a sudden.
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:41.040]  Now, one of my... who in the hell can go and tell carrier or anybody else, I mean, who
[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:42.040]  about it?
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.960]  Well, he did this, and the man doesn't even have any jurisdiction.
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:51.280]  So we go back to, you know, media central, what do we do, guys?
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:52.280]  Call it a sellout.
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:53.280]  A sellout?
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:56.480]  Yeah, that Trump made concessions.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:03.120]  This private citizen made concessions, okay, fine, kept them here, saved 1,000 jobs, saved,
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:07.320]  I don't know, how much money and lost wages, unemployment.
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:15.680]  So somehow they're trying to spend that, and it took Ronald Reagan eight weeks to pick,
[02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:19.120]  I think, the person in charge of the transition.
[02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:22.520]  There's been nobody who has worked this fast.
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.520]  He hasn't even taken a vacation.
[02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.160]  Yeah, it's amazing, the energy that he has.
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:28.760]  And now he's doing tours again.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:29.760]  That's the amazing thing.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:31.560]  Yeah, they can't keep up with his energy.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:34.120]  And they're not going to give him a honeymoon.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:35.120]  That's for sure.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:36.120]  I had Gerald Salenty on yesterday.
[02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:41.320]  He said, look at all the glowing covers for Obama when he was president-elect, and then
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.280]  look at the immediate attacks on Donald Trump.
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.800]  It's absolutely amazing to look at the contrast between the two.
[02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:48.880]  A couple of things here.
[02:18:48.880 --> 02:18:55.160]  If you're a big Godfather fan, when he was at Jean Georges here at Columbus Circle with
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:59.120]  Mitt Romney and Ryan's Brevis, do you see old Mittens face, that look of...
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:03.560]  Yeah, that picture that's going around Twitter, yeah, the social media, that's really funny.
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:07.120]  Yeah, it was like Sillatzo and McCluskey when Michael came back from the men's room, you
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.640]  know, when they're, that moment of, oh no, oh no, I'm going to get into Louis Clamhouse
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:13.640]  here.
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:15.920]  So that was this amazing moment.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:21.600]  Then we even watched today, one of the best things, they have the elevator cam at Trump
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:22.600]  Tower.
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:24.600]  It's not funny.
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.400]  The day the naked cowboy showed up, and I've been tweeting, I've been tweeting that Trump
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:31.400]  picked him as the new fed chairman.
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.880]  Let's see if it picks up a new tractor.
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:34.880]  Look, it could happen.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:35.880]  Now how about this?
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:38.400]  How about Mad Dog Mattis?
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:40.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  We got a new patent.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.880]  That's an article that I think we've got up, but he does look like George Patton, doesn't
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:46.880]  he?
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:48.560]  And he's got some interesting quotes like George Patton.
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.920]  We're going to be right back.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:51.360]  We're going to take a quick commercial break.
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:53.240]  We're talking to Lionel.
[02:19:53.240 --> 02:19:55.120]  Lionel Media is his Twitter handle.
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.120]  We'll be right back with Lionel.

[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.680]  My name is Lee and I'm 41.
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:04.560]  I've been using One World Wave for two and a half years now.
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.320]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago and since that
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:13.880]  time I've been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting or just normal activities
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:16.920]  with my children without having severe back pain.
[02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:20.840]  Since I've started using One World Wave, I've been able to walk more, engage in activities
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:23.440]  with my children and have less lower back pain.
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:27.240]  One World Wave has helped me regain back my strength, confidence, and have a healthier
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:28.240]  life.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:32.560]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds, my A1C dropped two points, and I have more
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:33.680]  energy now.
[02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:36.320]  One World Wave has helped me regain back my life.

[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:14.200]  We're talking to Lionel.
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:19.640]  You know, I was thinking during the break about the stories we've seen the last couple
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:23.680]  of days, how they're talking about social media being weaponized by the Russians in
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:27.360]  this election, and I was thinking, you know, really the way they're weaponizing social
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:32.280]  media, it's interesting, isn't it, how they accuse us of things and it's the things that
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:34.680]  they're doing, protecting on to us.
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:39.000]  I mean, the people who are weaponizing social media, the people trying to shut down Breitbart,
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.920]  they're trying to organize a boycott of Breitbart by corporations.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:47.040]  And so Breitbart pushed back, but of course what we've learned the last couple of days,
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:53.360]  is this organization, Kellogg's, that has GMO corn, sugar, palm oil made by child labor.
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:57.720]  These people who've given a million dollars to support Black Lives Matter, you know, Soros
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:01.400]  organizations like that, they're trying to censor Breitbart.
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:08.120]  And at the same time, we see the State Department now, we had this vote pass on Wednesday, $160
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:12.560]  million over two years for the State Department to decide what is true and what isn't.
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:17.440]  You know, we try to fight that here at InfoWars by funding ourselves independently.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:21.440]  We try to give you things that aren't made out of GMO corn, sugar, and palm oil.
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:24.600]  Things that aren't like Kellogg's sugar.
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.120]  We try to give you stuff that is healthy.
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:28.640]  And then there's this article, I'm sitting here looking at this article I talked about
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:32.960]  in the last hour briefly, the Parkinson's could start in the gut.
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:38.240]  This is a new study from the journal Cell that says that could overhaul medical research
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:39.760]  and the treatment of Parkinson's.
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:43.880]  Scientists have found the first ever conclusive link between gut microbes and the development
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:46.640]  of Parkinson's like movement disorders and mice.
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:52.080]  It suggests that probiotic or prebiotic therapies have the potential to alleviate the symptoms
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:55.880]  of the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States.
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.640]  So just think about that.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:00.440]  You're right to know about your medical treatment.
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:02.280]  You're right to know the truth about politics.
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:04.440]  I have an open discussion of these things.
[02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:06.120]  These people want to shut this stuff down.
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:12.160]  We fund our operation by giving you high quality products that will help your health.
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:15.480]  And we want to try to keep that information free, both political and medical.
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:20.240]  So think about that and take a look at our products that help your gut.
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:25.400]  Things like biome defense, a probiotic, of course, things like living defense and liver
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:30.040]  cleanse and all these different products that are focused on gut health.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:32.880]  We've been telling you for a long time as Dr. Group has, that's something you really
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:33.880]  need to focus on.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:37.280]  It's a vital part of your nutrition.
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:40.840]  Just like you want to exercise, you want to have good nutrition, and you need to pay
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:43.280]  attention though to your gut health.
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:48.600]  And we have a whole slew of products at InfowarsLife.com that focus on that.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:52.960]  Biome defense is a key one because it provides probiotics, but we also have vitamin mineral
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:56.360]  fusion drink mix back in stock at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.720]  It gives you the essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids your body needs.
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:05.320]  It has things like vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, folic acid,
[02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:07.000]  calcium, many other things.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.720]  It's all there and easy to take, great tasting.
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:13.640]  You get a full month supply in each one of these containers.
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:18.080]  You can find it at InfowarsLife.com, a great way to make sure that you're proactive about
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.080]  your health.
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.240]  And then there are specific things that can directly address your gut health as well as
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:25.040]  your general nutrition level.
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:26.400]  That's the way we find this operation.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:30.080]  We appreciate your support and that is what keeps us independent.
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:34.160]  So we aren't dependent on these multinational corporations that are now trying to shut down
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.160]  freedom of speech.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:36.160]  Let's go back to Lionel.
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:41.600]  Lionel, we were just talking about the media pushback and trying to make it a bad thing
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:44.680]  that Donald Trump saved jobs and he's not even president.
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:45.680]  Right.
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:46.680]  Yeah, it's not amazing.
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:49.840]  You know, he said something just now which made me think of something.
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:54.200]  What if I told you that you would one day be reading a story, David, in which there would
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:58.720]  be something in the United States called the Ministry of Truth.
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:27:59.720]  Yeah.
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:06.720]  Because what you just said, they're kind of a weird dystopian, Orwellian, the Ministry
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:07.720]  of Truth.
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:08.720]  Yes.
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:11.000]  That's precisely why they're creating, isn't it, Lionel?
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  That is a question.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.040]  Within the State Department and within the NDAA.
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:16.040]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:20.280]  We've seen that before for indefinite detention by the military without trial.
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:26.280]  And there doesn't seem to be any kind of alarm system in the part of a lot of Americans,
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:31.120]  any kind of antibodies to this that arise where people think, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:34.280]  wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:38.360]  But Donald Trump, the first thing, you know, when Donald Trump came along, look, I'd be
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:43.520]  less than honest with you if I told you that I thought, oh, sure, I knew he'd make it.
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:45.240]  Yeah, right.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:48.360]  Against the Republican machine, Donald Trump?
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:49.360]  Sure.
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.000]  But what the hell?
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.080]  First thing he did one time was, it got my attention was he brought up, in essence, the
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:00.960]  president's provenance, the birth certificate, the birther issue, which of course was brought
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:06.000]  to you by Hillary Clinton and Mark, Mark, uh, uh, Penn and, and, uh,
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  Yeah, they were the first ones to put it out there, yeah.
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  It was their memo.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  One of it.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000]  And whether you want to go through that again, it doesn't matter.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.520]  I thought, whoa, wow, wow.
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:15.680]  This guy's daring.
[02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.240]  I like this.
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:22.440]  I don't care whether he's actually saying something that veers him, and then he talked
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:23.440]  about vaccines.
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:25.720]  I thought, I love this.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:31.320]  If we can get him to talk about aerosolized nanoparticulates and, and, you know, chemtrails
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:37.320]  and geoengineering, if we can maybe have him have a permanent subcommittee to reopen 9-11
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:39.600]  and that con called the official story.
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:41.960]  I mean, that, I mean, who believes this?
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:45.920]  I mean, seriously, I don't know anybody hang on, we'll talk more about that when we come
[02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:47.640]  back from the break because we have that clip.
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:49.120]  I don't know if you've seen it lying old word.
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:50.640]  He talked the day of 9-11.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:51.640]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:30:00.160]  On the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:02.840]  It's the Donald Trump victory tour.
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:08.800]  President-elect Donald Trump is now touring multiple states that helped him win the election.
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:14.000]  First stop was Cincinnati, Ohio, where Trump outlined his America first policy.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:22.320]  You hear a lot of talk about how we're becoming a globalized world, but the relationships
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:32.600]  people value in this country are local, family, city, state, country, they're local.
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:41.240]  There is no global ethnic, no global currency, no certificate of global citizenship.
[02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:48.640]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:31:00.320]  And you can watch this speech in its entirety right now at infowars.com.
[02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:04.200]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:09.680]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Info War, a 360 win.
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:14.640]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:16.240]  at infowars.com.
[02:31:16.240 --> 02:31:20.080]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:24.160]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:29.400]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:31:29.400 --> 02:31:33.480]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[02:31:48.300 --> 02:31:49.800]  this is a sure win.
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:51.280]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:55.680]  Win win win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:59.640]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:03.360]  You ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:07.240]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:09.520]  It's wrong and we all know it.
[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:12.480]  I'm Charlie Daniels and I'm here to tell you about it.
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:17.640]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:24.440]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:32.320]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper, revelation dawn of
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:33.320]  global government.
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:59.040]  We're the solution, Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:26.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:38.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and we're talking to Lionel just
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:39.680]  before we went to the break.
[02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:45.680]  We were talking about how they're pushing it back against Donald Trump.
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:49.400]  They're pushing it back against the media that they believe helped to get the truth
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:50.800]  out there about globalism.
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:53.600]  And so they're trying to shut us down and as Lionel pointed out, it sounds a lot like
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:54.600]  the Ministry of Truth.
[02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:57.240]  That's what they're funding with $160 million.
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:03.520]  They want the State Department to identify and push back against propaganda that's quite
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:08.080]  frankly folks or well in by any definition of the word.
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:13.760]  And I think Lionel, when we look at this, we also see them pushing back against what
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:17.080]  Donald Trump did with the carrier program.
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:23.160]  And I don't think people are making the connection that Barack Obama already gave carrier $5
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:28.000]  million of federal taxpayer money as part of the green program to preserve a green agenda.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.400]  It didn't keep their jobs here though.
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:30.680]  It's a very different thing.
[02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:33.720]  So here he is just talking to them and saying, hey, I think it's going to be in your best
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:35.560]  interest to stay here.
[02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:39.280]  The little bit of money that they got was from Indiana and that money is going to stay
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:44.840]  there and be multiplied by carriers contribution and by the money that is spent by the individuals
[02:34:44.840 --> 02:34:47.480]  there to amounts to $700 per job per year.
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:51.320]  So those people are going to pay way more than that in taxes staying in Indiana with
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:52.320]  their jobs.
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:57.120]  But people are completely ignoring as they criticize Donald Trump for this saying, well,
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:58.840]  we don't want to give people stimulus.
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:00.200]  He's not necessarily done that.
[02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:02.760]  He's just said, we're going to have a regulatory situation here.
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:07.200]  This is going to be to the advantage of companies to do business here in America to keep their
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:08.920]  factories here in America.
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.360]  But Obama created a failed program.
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:16.120]  He had subsidies to cylinder, but he had a failed program, $2.3 billion.
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:20.760]  They put in a 48C program and that was some of the money that went to carrier and it had
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.480]  no effect to keep those jobs here.
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:26.640]  But you know, let's just stop for just a moment.
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:31.000]  Here is a guy who, and I can't believe I'm using this term because I hated this during
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.320]  the election, but the optics of this.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:34.320]  The optics.
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:39.640]  Here's an American who said, okay, I voted for you, Donald Trump.
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:42.320]  You said you were going to look out for me.
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:48.320]  And by the way, what he just said, David, about globalism, see, this is Alex Jones'
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:49.320]  ease.
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:51.920]  This is the language of info wars.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.200]  This is what you've been talking about because I've asked people before and they've told
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:57.200]  me, what's wrong with globalism?
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:03.200]  I said, no, no, no, we're not talking about, we are the world that I'd like to teach the
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:04.200]  world.
[02:36:04.200 --> 02:36:05.200]  We're not talking about that.
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:10.040]  We're talking about a unipolar, basically a dissolution of jurisdiction and a one massive
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:11.040]  new world.
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:12.040]  All right.
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:13.040]  But look at the way that he put it, Lionel.
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:18.160]  He talked about the sovereignty issues and he said a global flag, a global currency,
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:20.040]  a global citizenship.
[02:36:20.040 --> 02:36:23.240]  That's what we always say sovereignty, but the genius of Donald Trump is that he puts
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.400]  it in those terms that everybody can understand.
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:31.000]  Hey, you're talking about the flag, the money and the citizenship.
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:35.200]  And that's what we're talking about when we say sovereignty, but he unpacked it.
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:38.680]  And did he, David, did he make an appointment to Bilderberg?
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:40.680]  I don't think I saw him.
[02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:42.520]  He might be the owner.
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:43.520]  Maybe he did.
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:44.520]  I don't know if he did.
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:45.520]  I don't think he's been there.
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:46.520]  Yeah.
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:50.000]  And that one is like, Hey, that's what I say to you guys.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.680]  But so here's what happened.
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:56.440]  So we came along and he said, I'm going to do things my way.
[02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:04.840]  Barack Obama was this nobody, non-descript, little community organizer, make a mistake,
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:07.400]  Senator, fast track him to you, Senator.
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:10.960]  And now he's like, just hand him the legislation, hand it to him, whatever it is.
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:13.640]  He went to war, drones, this globalism war.
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:15.760]  I mean, just, just name it.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:17.800]  And he just, he just did it.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:20.200]  And he said, I'm a good soldier and he's moving on.
[02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:21.200]  Okay.
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:27.600]  He just moving on, but, but created such a feeling in so many people like, isn't he
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:28.600]  a good looking guy?
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:29.600]  Isn't he a nice man?
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:31.600]  No, he's not a nice man.
[02:37:31.600 --> 02:37:36.640]  So here comes Trump and he says, I am a billionaire.
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:37.640]  You can't find me.
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:39.320]  I'm going to pick Wilbur Ross.
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:43.960]  I'm going to pick people who are, who actually are in their seventies.
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:46.800]  They've made everything you could possibly do.
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:47.800]  They want to leave a legacy.
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:49.720]  I'm going to find something wrong with it.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:52.720]  So anyway, so here's what I wish you would do next.
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:58.040]  Reopen, reopen that horrible 9 11 committee, which everybody knows is just a joke.
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:37:59.600]  I mean, what do we have to fear?
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:01.240]  I mean, just the truth.
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:02.600]  Just tell us what happened.
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:10.040]  And if ever there was anybody who would take on these, these issues, which means so much
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:11.040]  to us.
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:18.240]  We're alluding to this before this video that was that propped up and got for YouTube, basically
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:26.360]  Donald Trump evaluating the official story of 9 11 and applying his own particular knowledge
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:32.240]  of architecture and structural engineering and saying, you know, this story, as you say
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:40.880]  in the South, that dog don't hunt, but he came along and while Hillary Clinton, who
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:48.720]  basically her campaign was this, it's mine, I'm entitled to it, give me a damn presidency.
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:53.320]  I don't want to, I'm not, I'm not going to go to Youngstown.
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:54.960]  I'm not going to do shots.
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:55.960]  Yeah, she was entitled.
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:57.240]  It was a sense of entitlement.
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:38:58.240]  It was a sense of privilege.
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:38:59.240]  It was amazing.
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:02.880]  And you know, I know when we look at this, I've got a special report from Alex Johnson,
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:06.800]  some critical information I'm going to cut to and we'll come back to this, but they spent
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:07.800]  the longest time.
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.360]  And who had the 9 11 Commission said, we want these pages, these 28 pages about the Saudis
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.360]  to go out and they couldn't get anything done.
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:17.960]  The people who ran the commission couldn't get it declassified until Donald Trump came
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:20.720]  out and started talking about say, hey, where are those pages?
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:23.680]  And then what happened that not only went out, but then they got the bill passed for
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:27.680]  custom compensation for the victims that's been held up by 15 years.
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:28.760]  And now what do we see?
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:33.260]  We see Lindsey Graham and John McCain saying, oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, trying to
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:37.520]  eviscerate that by putting in, they really didn't know anything that was happening.
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:40.360]  You know, the same type of excuse we saw Comey do for Hillary.
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:43.640]  I want to talk to you more about this 9 11 thing and where we could go with that.
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:46.080]  But first we've got a critical report from Alex Jones.
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:48.480]  Let's go to that report right now.
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:53.560]  I am asking listeners and viewers who are tuning into us, not just here in the United
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:59.760]  States, but all over the world to please listen to me very, very carefully.
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:04.700]  I know we cover a lot of incredibly important information here, but what I'm about to hit
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:06.200]  is paramount.
[02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:13.280]  Now, some of this you would have heard before from me, but most of it is brand new.
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:18.680]  Now, it is not prophecy that we're being proven right that worldwide from communist China
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:25.120]  to the EU, to the United States, globalist corporations and their operatives and government
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:33.760]  are openly calling for censoring the people of the planet that criticize globalism, unelected
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:36.240]  corporate rule.
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.840]  We are having devastating victories all over the planet and they are scared.
[02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:45.440]  They admit their own publications and again, if they're so arrogant, they think you're
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:46.440]  stupid.
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:47.440]  They think we're stupid.
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:51.080]  They think we don't even read these where they admit planetary government dumbing us
[02:40:51.080 --> 02:40:52.560]  down, controlling us.
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:56.080]  The WikiLeaks say, keep us desperate, keep us in the dark, keep us poor.
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.040]  I mean, we know, okay, guys, we know how evil you are.
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:01.240]  We understand your ideology.
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:08.840]  We understand you can't compete with Americanism, but we now know their attack plan three weeks
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:13.880]  after Trump's devastating victory, where he won with such a massive landslide that they
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:14.880]  were unable to steal it.
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:16.840]  Folks, he probably won by 65% of the vote.
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:17.840]  I'm serious.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:21.120]  I mean, that's what internal polls were showing was in 15, 20 points ahead.
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:22.120]  She had crowds of 300.
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:24.240]  He had crowds of 30,000 on average.
[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:25.560]  It's just, it's incredible.
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:26.560]  She stole five states.
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:28.480]  That's been confirmed.
[02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:31.560]  Millions of illegals voting, millions of dead people, 20-something million dead people
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:32.560]  on the rolls.
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:34.200]  I mean, this is over at the top.
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:37.600]  We got the Democratic operatives all caught admitting election fraud and how they were
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:38.600]  already doing it.
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.640]  And then Anderson Cooper gets up on CNN and says, no evidence three times in a row.
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:46.080]  I mean, what a joke, buddy.
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:47.320]  People hate you.
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:48.720]  They wouldn't believe anything you told them.
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:52.440]  If you walked out at high noon and said, the sun was fricking yellow, they wouldn't believe
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:54.720]  it coming out of your little snot nose.
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:57.920]  So sticky blue blood bastards, excuse me.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:02.480]  Now we are looking at the enemy plan now.
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:07.680]  And I go back to Matt Drudge now over a year ago, giving us the exclusive interview, just
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.400]  coming out of nowhere because he met with the Supreme Court justice and others.
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:14.440]  I'm not a liberty to give you all the details, but I made phone calls and confirmed it with
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:16.240]  other people.
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:18.520]  Not that meeting, but others like it.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:20.840]  Everybody was told it's over in 2016.
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.840]  We're bringing in the dictatorship.
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:24.840]  We're getting rid of the Republican party.
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:25.840]  You better give up.
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:27.000]  There's nothing you can do.
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:28.840]  We're getting rid of free speech.
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:30.800]  We're going to start arresting people we don't agree with.
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:32.720]  We're going to take the fricking guns.
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:34.680]  Your kids belong to the state.
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:39.800]  Most of this, you saw in the news, but the intelligence agencies who aren't perfect,
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:41.800]  they do the hanging though.
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:44.080]  They sat there and said, it's all true.
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.800]  You're going to end the freedom in Europe and the United States.
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:50.880]  The Communist Chinese are going to oversee censorship of the web, which is now in the
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:51.880]  news.
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:55.800]  Drudge learned this a year ago, I learned it this year ago, that they were going forward
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:57.080]  with it.
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:01.200]  The intelligence agencies leaked the hell out of the truth.
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.440]  Patriots like you, every race, color, and creed spread the word.
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:06.440]  Absolutely.
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:10.960]  Foreign governments and others from Iceland to Greece to Russia are fighting the same
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:15.280]  globalists, so they joined us, but it wasn't propaganda, it wasn't lies.
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:20.520]  It was humanity organized independently as organic human intelligence, resisting the
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:25.880]  democracy of these inbred, out of control globalists, so history is happening.
[02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:30.280]  So now, three weeks and a couple days into the giant Trump victory, as you move forward
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:37.760]  with Americanism, not globalism, a two-way fair street, not a win-lose system, they are
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:39.480]  now striking.
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:43.760]  As David and I reported earlier, the House has passed, it's going to the Senate, $170
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:51.480]  million to open a new domestic press-control Operation Mockingbird Part II system to identify
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:53.360]  fake news and have it banned.
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:57.800]  If you think Google is starting to ban us off Chrome and Breitbart is getting delisted
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:03.040]  and all this is happening off a few fake lists put out by anonymous groups that Google picked
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:05.520]  up, wait until the State Department issues won.
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:08.760]  Now, I've got a counterplan against this, but we knew it was coming.
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:15.560]  Now, if you add all this on top of each other, they've got Kellogg's coming out saying that
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:21.360]  they're going to pull their web sponsorship from anybody out there, big, fricking deal.
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:23.160]  Now they're going to have a, quote, coalition.
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:28.560]  Good, list the hundreds of groups that we already know are funding radical jihadi groups
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:32.840]  and Black Lives Matter groups and other Ford Foundation destabilization groups.
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:34.760]  Show us the corporations that are already funding this.
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:35.760]  We already know them.
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:39.000]  They fund Metsha, they fund La Raza, they fund BLM.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.960]  This has always been the plan to finally bring the country down.
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:45.360]  Not to empower these people, but to bring us down.
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:49.280]  So thank you for proving everything I've warned people about for decades, but I got it all
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:55.600]  from the Senator Frank Church Committee meeting to the 1970, 76, 77, 78.
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.640]  I interviewed Anthony Frick and Sutton, the top congressional expert.
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:04.000]  This was a battle plan hatched in the 50s, okay?
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.600]  Because Henry Ford and others were so mad that I guess Hitler had lost, okay?
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:10.240]  I mean, folks, learn your damn history, excuse me.
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:15.480]  So we're sitting here facing all of this right now, and America was about to be basically
[02:45:15.480 --> 02:45:16.480]  executed.
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:19.800]  It was about to be over, barring civil insurrection.
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.480]  And so balance was restored, okay?
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:27.480]  And we got a beach head back in Washington, and they are flipping out, redoubling their
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:31.960]  race-baiting efforts, going completely crazy.
[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:36.440]  So we didn't start this, but we have to get on the offense and boycott Kellogg's and boycott
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:38.320]  any of these globalist companies.
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:39.320]  Miller Brewing.
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:41.840]  I mean, folks, you go down the list of these.
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:45.000]  You can go to who funds Black Lives Matter, Mecheloriza, you name it.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  Kellogg's gave them a million bucks.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.600]  Soros has given them 500 million.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:51.000]  Ford Foundation, 300 million.
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.200]  Go look it up.
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:58.640]  These are the dedicated groups sworn to bring fascism to America and to use race-baiting
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:02.160]  and reverse colonialism to bring us down.
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:03.160]  Okay?
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:07.360]  You have to understand, it's called liberation theology, none of this is my opinion.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.880]  This is absolute historical fact.
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:14.320]  So you see Twitter, you see Facebook, you see Google, all banning people everywhere for
[02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:15.320]  no reason.
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:18.920]  People post American flags and American eagles on Twitter.
[02:46:18.920 --> 02:46:19.920]  It's being banned.
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:21.400]  That's on infowords.com today.
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:25.680]  They are training you for the massive censorship and the control.
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:26.960]  So how do we counter this?
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:30.880]  Well, we have President Trump, even if the Senate's dumb enough to pass this, as soon
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.760]  as he gets in, kills the State Department with a whole new office, you know, hatching
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:40.240]  all these new bureaucracies and all these agents to come eat out our substance, a.k.a.
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:42.640]  the Declaration of Independence warned of.
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:47.120]  He needs to shut that down in hundreds of other little sub-agencies like cancers or
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:48.280]  metastasizing.
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:50.840]  We need to boycott Kellogg's, and I'm calling for everybody.
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:52.480]  I want an official tweet.
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:53.480]  I'm putting it out.
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:56.040]  I'm going to really push to boycott all these companies.
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:59.320]  We're going to put a list together for next week of the companies to boycott.
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:04.360]  We're also going to issue our own list of fake news with Humet, and the people are going
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:07.960]  to overpower this grindle and rip its political arms out by the sockets.
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:08.960]  It's already happening.
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:09.960]  You want a war?
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:11.160]  Believe me, you got one scum.
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:14.560]  Thank you for showing us just how authoritarian you are.
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:18.920]  A song that for 40 days missing has now finally resurfaced.
[02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:21.520]  Thank God he has been under house arrest.
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:22.760]  They weren't letting him talk to media.
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.760]  That's now coming out.
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:27.600]  Be careful what he says, but I knew something was going on, and he says, listen, the new
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:33.200]  bombshell is Merkel and the EU super-army to take over countries inside the Euro.
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:36.680]  They try to leave peacefully, which never even voted to enter it.
[02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:37.680]  See?
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:38.680]  See?
[02:47:38.680 --> 02:47:42.000]  This is global corporate dictatorship through the EU, through the Asian Union, through the
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.320]  North American Union, through the Atlantic Treaty and the TPP that wells the three parts
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:47.320]  together.
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:50.080]  Epic history is happening right now.
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:53.600]  All of that is unfolding.
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:56.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, my main point is this.
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:47:59.840]  I heard David Nye talking about this calmly, doing a great job as a gentleman.
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:04.520]  I thought about myself talking about it gentlemanly the last few days, and I just thought to myself,
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:05.840]  why are you successful, Alex?
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.160]  Because you genuinely get people out of their trance because you're out of your trance,
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:16.360]  and you're upset and angry about multinationals coming in to shut down your free speech.
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:18.080]  That's why I've been successful.
[02:48:18.080 --> 02:48:19.880]  That's why we've been able to take action.
[02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:21.080]  That's why we're changing the world.
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:26.480]  We have to get really pissed and not just think everything's okay now that Trump's in.
[02:48:26.480 --> 02:48:30.520]  We have to block these type of bizarre agencies that come out and decide that we're going
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:34.160]  to have state-run controlled media, which Obama talked about in these speeches he gave
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:35.160]  last week.
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:37.200]  Hell, Rolling Stone's calling for it.
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:40.840]  Pathetic, collapsing media wants to shut us down.
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:42.320]  This is a great honor.
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:46.400]  But if we don't resist it, they will end up shutting us down, and then Katie barred the
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:47.400]  door.
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:53.400]  Now, in a moment, I'm going to play a clip from Democratic House member Emanuel Cleaver
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:57.600]  on, again, one of the establishment brainwashing channels saying, listen, the Democrats are
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:48:59.100]  in total disarray.
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:00.320]  We're going to lose this party.
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:01.320]  It's dying.
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.520]  Yeah, you lost 13 Senate seats, a whole bunch of House seats, with 30-something House seats,
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:12.320]  900 legislative seats, the record number of gubernatorial seats.
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:14.040]  People can pull the numbers up for themselves.
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:15.040]  It's staggering.
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:16.040]  I'm going for memory teleprompter-free.
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:21.800]  But one of the biggest sweeps in history, Trump has the prefecta, the legislative, the executive
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:24.320]  and the judicial, but a limited window.
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:25.480]  This is biblical what's happening.
[02:49:25.480 --> 02:49:28.880]  Now, I'm going to play this clip with him in a moment, and then go back to Lionel and
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:31.280]  back to David Knight here on the live transmission.
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:34.680]  And they can obviously debate this and discuss this, but I'm going to be listening to get
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:36.480]  their take.
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:40.320]  But you have to understand, folks, that they knew they were dying.
[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:42.960]  They know that all they've got is race-baiting.
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:46.800]  What with Americanism wants to bring prosperity to everybody and bring us together, this is
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:52.480]  the antidote to globalism worldwide that uses racial strife and divide and conquer to control
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:53.480]  everybody.
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:56.640]  So here he is saying they're on their deathbed.
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:49:57.640]  They're imploding.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:01.240]  And of the Republican establishment, fights against Trump, it's going to be their political
[02:50:01.240 --> 02:50:02.800]  deathbed as well.
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:07.360]  We have to route these people now forever and restore our republic, and we could save
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  the planet.
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:09.880]  But we have to believe in it.
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:13.520]  We have to know how big mistakes are, and we have to realize that the enemy has never
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:18.920]  been weaker, but has also never been stronger because now they're completely desperate and
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:20.880]  not as arrogant as they used to be.
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.120]  So here's the clip of the congressman telling the truth, desperately trying to get them
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:26.760]  to reorganize a strategy.
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:27.760]  They can't.
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:34.560]  They follow the race-bait, divide and conquer, grand game, Balkanization program that the
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:39.760]  British used all over the world in the British Empire, but in a modern 2.0 Ford Foundation
[02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:41.440]  and Carnegie Endowment.
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.000]  So if people want to understand the battle plan, get this information out to everybody.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:49.760]  I've laid out all the names, all the terms, all the facts, who the enemies are.
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:54.240]  Here is the clip of them on their political deathbed, and then back to David Knight.
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:58.280]  And of course, Lionel, who's a constitutional lawyer to break all of us down straight ahead,
[02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:00.400]  and then Paul Watson's coming up in the next hour.
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:01.400]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:02.400]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:03.400]  Thank you for supporting this broadcast.
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:07.960]  Spread these links like your lives depend on it, because this is the absolute battle
[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:10.400]  of Americanism versus globalism.
[02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:13.040]  Thanks to President Obama.
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:18.960]  The real reason Democrats lost the election, Fox News, barely in an interview with Fox,
[02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:23.960]  with Rolling Stone, he says, I think part of it has to do with our ability, our failure
[02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:26.400]  to reach those voters effectively.
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:31.840]  Part of it is Fox News, in every bar and restaurant in big chunks of the country.
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:37.680]  You know, it's sad that the president doesn't want the people to know the truth.
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:42.560]  He said this several years ago when he said, just stop watching Fox News.
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:48.840]  He does not want the people to know the truth, and quite honestly, even by its own admission,
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:54.600]  CNN has been telling half-truths they've been giving distorted information, and that's
[02:51:54.600 --> 02:51:56.600]  what the president doesn't want.
[02:51:56.600 --> 02:52:02.360]  If, if there had been CNN stations in all of these places he claims to have seen, he
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:08.520]  would have been okay with it.
[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:09.520]  Yeah, amazing.
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.360]  What do you come as there, Lionel?
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:13.320]  You know, it's not the economy.
[02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:15.200]  It's not the identity politics that have failed.
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.760]  And I said at election day, I said, I hope that with the defeat of Hillary Clinton, identity
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:21.880]  politics becomes as out of fashion as her pantsuits.
[02:52:21.880 --> 02:52:23.080]  But it's not those two things.
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:27.440]  No, it's, it's Fox News, and he doesn't even get specific about what he doesn't like about
[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:28.440]  Fox News.
[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:29.720]  He just attacks them as an entity.
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:30.720]  That seems to be the strategy.
[02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:33.840]  See, that's the most stupid thing in the world that anybody could do.
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:39.400]  What I would have done had I suggested him, but I would have never mentioned Fox News.
[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:40.400]  Never.
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:41.640]  I would have said something like this.
[02:52:41.640 --> 02:52:46.520]  I would have said, one of the things that's so important about a republic, not a democracy,
[02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:51.000]  but a republic, is to appreciate sometimes change and novelty.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:57.920]  And sometimes when people are used to a situation, used to a certain degree of living and peace
[02:52:57.920 --> 02:52:59.820]  and prosperity.
[02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:02.620]  Sometimes they figure, you know what, let's just change things.
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:07.360]  I would have made the election seem almost like, like an anomaly, like a bunch of crazy
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:11.040]  kids deciding, oh, let's, let's take a new route home tonight.
[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:13.240]  Let's, let's try a new kind of cologne.
[02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:18.680]  I would have minimized and trivialized the Trump experiment.
[02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:22.160]  I would have said, I would have placated Trump.
[02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:25.160]  I want to sit there, there, you know, it's wonderful.
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:30.960]  And one thing I'll tell you that I've learned, and Mr. Trump, we wish you the best.
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:36.320]  Because when you sit in this office, you're going to find out just, there's a, there's
[02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:41.440]  an old expression in there's a Sicilian phrase, dal diri ad fare c'è di medri in mare, from
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:44.440]  saying into doing, there's the C in between.
[02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:49.040]  And Mr. Trump, you're going to find yourself in the C. I would have made it sound like
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:52.200]  parenthetically, this guy doesn't know what the hell he's doing.
[02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:56.120]  I would have never, ever mentioned Fox.
[02:53:56.120 --> 02:54:03.240]  In fact, I would have said, I laud people like David Knight and Alex Jones for their
[02:54:03.240 --> 02:54:05.800]  little attempts at news.
[02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:06.800]  Good for them.
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:08.800]  You know, I would have been condescending.
[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:09.800]  Exactly.
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:10.800]  Yeah.
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:11.800]  I would have made it change.
[02:54:11.800 --> 02:54:12.800]  Like this is a weird experiment.
[02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:14.800]  Hey, look, you want to change some stuff?
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:15.800]  Go ahead.
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:18.280]  But I got to tell you something which is really, really important right now.
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:19.280]  And this is it.
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:23.320]  I want everybody to do this, and I'm speaking just for me, not for you.
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:25.400]  Let us lose the idea of party.
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:27.720]  Lose the idea of party and who's in, who's on chairman.
[02:54:27.720 --> 02:54:29.600]  I don't give a damn about chairman.
[02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:32.560]  I, I, I'm a, a, a political atheist.
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:34.600]  I've made a black belt and real politic.
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:36.240]  I'm not into this stuff.
[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:39.680]  Ask yourself very simply this, what is it that matters to you?
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:46.720]  Now, if somebody decides to come up with a plan that works with your particular worldview,
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:47.720]  terrific.
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:52.720]  It may not be Republican, it may not be Democrat, but Hillary Clinton, let's just go back.
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:54.640]  The reason why she lost is very simple.
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:54:57.560]  Number one, she was breathtakingly incoherent.
[02:54:57.560 --> 02:54:59.640]  Number two, she was gravely ill.
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:05.080]  In fact, the Washington Post today had a reference to the fact that the deep dark recesses of
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:10.000]  the internet decided to promulgate these lies about her sickness.
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.520]  Where in the hell did that come from?
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:19.800]  Then she was probably, and I was asking people, one of the most vile and corrupt politicians
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:23.760]  and candidates, because you know, we always know, yeah, there's money involved.
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:27.960]  But I was trying to think who in our recent, relatively recent history compares to her.
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:30.120]  And I thought Warren Harding.
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:33.280]  Warren Harding is the only person I can think of in the twenties, because say which one
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:39.640]  about Nixon or Johnson, even with Bobby Baker, yeah, buddy was a part of it, but it was ideology
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:40.920]  that motivated her.
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:43.280]  She was nothing but money.
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:49.400]  Then you had the Clinton Foundation, the CGI, CHI, you also have that, which by the way
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:51.680]  is not going away.
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:56.840]  But you know what, there was one other thing she didn't have, and that was a strategy or
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:57.840]  a plan.
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:00.600]  Everybody was saying Trump has got some really clear strategies and plans.
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:04.640]  I want to play for you really quickly here, a clip from Representative Cleaver, and he
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:07.840]  admits Democrats don't have a strategy or plan still.
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.200]  Let's play a quick clip and get your reaction to that.
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:11.200]  Sure.
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:12.200]  What would the cost have been?
[02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:14.760]  You mentioned the cost would have been too high.
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:16.040]  What would those costs have been?
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:21.840]  Well, first of all, if we had elected new leaders to come in, just think they would have been
[02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:29.840]  elected yesterday, and they would have had hardly any time to do anything except move
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:32.280]  into a new office.
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:37.080]  At the present time, I've got to say we have no strategy and we have no plan.
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:45.720]  But at least we have some proven leadership that can take us into what's going to be a
[02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:48.080]  new era.
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:57.440]  But think about this, we cannot have as our plan to go to the floor for the next two years
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:59.560]  only to hit the ceiling.
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:00.560]  That's not a plan.
[02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:01.560]  That's not a strategy.
[02:57:01.560 --> 02:57:06.560]  And that would have been pretty much all we would have had if we had changed leaders
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:07.560]  abruptly.
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:14.400]  I do think it is time for us to bring in younger people in leadership.
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:19.960]  In fact, if we don't, I think it will fail the demise of the Democratic caucus if we're
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:24.520]  not already, permanently, in a state of small.
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:30.000]  We should bring in young blood, but just not now.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000]  Not yet.
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  Hold on.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  Change is coming.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  Okay.
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.900]  Now, as they're talking about that, of course, the context is he's saying we don't have a
[02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:41.480]  strategy or plan, but we've got proven leaders and they're showing pictures of Nancy Pelosi
[02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:45.000]  because she just won re-election as the minority leader.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.760]  She had 30% of the vote defect away from her.
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:51.960]  But here's a woman who has been, you know, Speaker of the House and minority leader
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:56.360]  for how many decades, I don't know, she's been there forever, she's got no strategy
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:57:57.360]  or plan.
[02:57:57.360 --> 02:57:58.920]  I mean, how is that a proven leadership?
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:02.080]  You've got no strategy or plan, you've been there forever, Nancy Pelosi, and you still
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:04.520]  don't have a plan or strategy.
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:05.840]  The plan was very simple.
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:06.840]  They were anti-Trump.
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:07.840]  It's like anti-gravity.
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:08.840]  They were anti-Trump.
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:14.760]  They talked about his hair, his stakes, his university, his bankruptcies, his family,
[02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:20.200]  the way he looks, his orange skin, and he said, great, you keep that up, and I'm going
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:23.000]  to forge ahead with a plan and with a strategy.
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.440]  Politics of personal destruction, that's all they had.
[02:58:25.440 --> 02:58:26.440]  That end of vision.
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:27.440]  And of course, he talked about that.
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:31.720]  He said, let's stop focusing on what divides us and talk about what unites us, being Americans
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:32.720]  to get our economy working.
[02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:36.480]  We're going to be with Lionel in the next section, and then we're going to have in the
[02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:38.840]  next hour, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:39.840]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:49.840]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:54.160]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfowarsLife.com.
[02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:58.160]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[02:58:58.160 --> 02:59:01.640]  and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:59:01.640 --> 02:59:07.480]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfowarsLife.com is loaded with a full month
[02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:13.080]  supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.

[02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:20.960]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:25.840]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:30.600]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:34.960]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:59:34.960 --> 02:59:40.400]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived, or of the highest
[02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:42.160]  quality lab standard.
[02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:43.600]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:44.600]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:52.080]  At InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion, take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:52.080 --> 03:00:01.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:18.480]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:23.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:23.240 --> 03:00:25.560]  I'm David Knight and still with me in this segment.
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:29.800]  Our last segment together is Lionel and the next segment, we will have Paul Joseph Watson
[03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:33.040]  from London picking up the hosting activities here.
[03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:37.000]  As we had to break Lionel, we were talking about how they don't really have a strategy.
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  They don't have a plan.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.240]  We just saw a Democrat admit that, he says, hey, but we do have a leader that we've had
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:43.240]  forever.
[03:00:43.240 --> 03:00:44.240]  It's a Pelosi.
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:46.440]  She's going to be there, but she's got no strategy, no plan.
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:50.080]  All we have seen, as you pointed out, is politics of personal destruction.
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:55.880]  We see the politics of division sold as a politics of diversity, but it's really about
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:56.880]  a division.
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:58.000]  And it's about diversion, isn't it?
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.840]  It's about pushing things away.
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:03.080]  How do you see them recouping from this?
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:07.800]  They don't seem to have learned anything from this last election.
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:09.880]  May I try it this way?
[03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:13.000]  By the way, let's think of what we would say.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.400]  Let's assume, God forbid, it would hire you and me to say, listen.
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:18.080]  You guys know what you're doing.
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:21.640]  Help us with the Democratic Party.
[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:26.440]  This is our thought experiment for all of the billions of people around the world watching
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:27.440]  InfoWars.
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:31.000]  Here's what I would say, a lie.
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  Just lie.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:33.880]  Come up and tell them you have something.
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:34.880]  Ask what people want.
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:35.880]  Just go to a mall.
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:37.680]  See, what do you care about?
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:45.160]  Crime, security, my family, taxes, the future, immigration, keep going, drug abuse, throw
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:50.000]  someone in, pets, I don't care, diet, throw in whatever you want.
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.480]  And then say, Hillary, go up and lie.
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:56.560]  Just say you're going to tackle and have something nominal.
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:01:58.240]  Don't just say point in my website.
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:01:59.240]  That was her big thing.
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:02.040]  Well, you know, if you go to my website, you know, if you go to my website, when she
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:06.680]  wasn't gravely ill, when she was able to actually speak to people, I wasn't gone to
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:08.480]  AWOL for 200 days.
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:13.200]  So and I'm not, I'm not kidding.
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:14.280]  I would have lied.
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:16.040]  I would have said, well, I'm going to say something.
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.040]  I'm going to say what I'm going to do.
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:19.040]  Name it.
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:22.360]  What happened was there was a sense of entitlement.
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:26.240]  You know, when I was a prosecutor, I used to run into every now and then these people
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:29.960]  who thought they were bulletproof and invisible, seriously, there were like bank robbers who
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:33.440]  would walk in and I'm saying, you again, why did you do this?
[03:02:33.440 --> 03:02:36.720]  Why did you go to the place where they knew you?
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:41.800]  Because I got away with it once and I did it twice and I did it again and I felt like
[03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:49.400]  maybe I'm just invisible because she had been told for so long, Hillary, this is your time,
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:52.680]  Hillary, this is how do you think she could have squirreled all that money away?
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:57.400]  How do you think she could have basically bamboozled people with forcing them to donate
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:03:02.480]  to the Clinton Foundation and pay a quarter of a million dollars for her speeches because
[03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:08.280]  she was so good at saying, no, no, Mr. Knight, you don't understand something.
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:10.120]  I'm going to be the president.
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:11.880]  I'm not going to be indicted.
[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:13.720]  It ain't going to happen.
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:17.840]  And Bernie, you can do all your stuff with all your millennials and Trump and I don't
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:22.800]  give a damn what you might as well just give me the crown now because I got news for you.
[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:25.160]  I'm on a fast track to the presidency.
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:26.160]  I mean, the Pope.
[03:03:26.160 --> 03:03:27.160]  Well, it was a rigged system.
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:28.640]  The Vatican can't do this.
[03:03:28.640 --> 03:03:30.240]  It was a rigged system and she knew it.
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:32.320]  She had the DNC rig for her.
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:35.920]  She had the media rigging it for her, feeding her answers and the background and everything.
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:39.240]  You know, I think you're onto something she could have gone out and asked people, you
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:41.600]  know, what are you concerned about and she could have lied to them and said, I share
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:42.600]  your concerns.
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:43.600]  I'm going to do this and that.
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:48.200]  But instead it was, she just ignored, didn't even pretend to care what the people wanted.
[03:03:48.200 --> 03:03:51.680]  It was all about her own personal privilege and entitlement.
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:55.240]  And I would have also told you, if you were God forbid, David, let's say you were Hillary
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:59.800]  Clinton and I'd say, whoa, whoa, whoa, Mr. Mr. Knight, come here for a second.
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:06.800]  Listen, don't say anything about forcing Trump to agree to accept the results of the election
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:11.720]  because Mr. Knight, I know this may be hard for you to believe, but you may not win.
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:14.480]  And we may have to, you know, I know it sounds crazy.
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:17.760]  I know I'm crazy to even suggest that.
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:19.080]  I'm out of my mind.
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:23.160]  I've been hitting it pretty hard, but don't say that.
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:24.160]  No, they didn't even.
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:25.960]  She made the rope that she hung herself with.
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:26.960]  Didn't she?
[03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:27.960]  Then, right.
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:34.520]  And then what happened was whenever there was this, this, this, this guy, this, this
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:42.440]  man who basically asked people and said so plainly, I'm going to tear up TPP, I'm going
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:47.880]  to get your, you know, I thought, you know what, if you can do it great, but damn it,
[03:04:47.880 --> 03:04:48.880]  it's a plan.
[03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:50.880]  Meanwhile, we had a strategy.
[03:04:50.880 --> 03:04:51.880]  You had a plan.
[03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:52.880]  Yeah.
[03:04:52.880 --> 03:04:53.880]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:56.160]  We're talking to Lionel, Lionel media.com and you can find them on Twitter at Lionel
[03:04:56.160 --> 03:04:57.160]  media.
[03:04:57.160 --> 03:04:58.160]  Thank you.
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:04:59.160]  Lionel coming up.
[03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:00.160]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:05:00.160 --> 03:05:04.560]  Last night, Donald J. Trump announced his pick for Secretary of Defense, General Matt
[03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:07.160]  Dogg Mattis, US Marine Corps.
[03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:08.160]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:09.320]  Hurrah, devil dog.
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:15.000]  Now we have a man who single handedly went in and unf**ked GIFCOM, which is Joint Forces
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.760]  Command, an area that for a long time was very screwed up.
[03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:23.960]  This guy walked in and the first day and wrote an email in all capital letters saying the
[03:05:23.960 --> 03:05:25.760]  holiday is over.
[03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:26.960]  Well, guess what?
[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:30.280]  Our military leaders have been on holiday.
[03:05:30.280 --> 03:05:33.040]  Our commander in chief has been on holiday.
[03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:34.280]  He's always playing golf.
[03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:35.880]  He's always going somewhere.
[03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:36.880]  Well, guess what?
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:40.720]  General Matt Dogg Mattis is now in charge and guess what?
[03:05:40.720 --> 03:05:43.480]  The holiday is over.
[03:05:43.480 --> 03:05:48.040]  He is going to get rid of all the people who are not part of the solution, but part of
[03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:53.440]  the problem and restore our military to the superpower it once was.
[03:05:53.440 --> 03:05:55.600]  This is a great day in America.
[03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:59.720]  This has been Joe Bayes with infowars.com.
[03:05:59.720 --> 03:06:02.480]  I want to tell you about a brand new Off the Grid product.
[03:06:02.480 --> 03:06:04.680]  It's a pocket sized solar generator.
[03:06:04.680 --> 03:06:08.760]  Even though it's so small you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110
[03:06:08.760 --> 03:06:10.400]  appliances at your house.
[03:06:10.400 --> 03:06:13.400]  Like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[03:06:13.400 --> 03:06:15.960]  The best part though, you can take it with you.
[03:06:15.960 --> 03:06:21.800]  It's mobile to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18 wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:06:21.800 --> 03:06:26.360]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of Off the Grid electricity, basically creating
[03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:28.800]  your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:29.800]  A true innovation.
[03:06:29.800 --> 03:06:32.080]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:33.760]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:06:33.760 --> 03:06:36.320]  One for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin.
[03:06:36.320 --> 03:06:40.480]  It's even a great Christmas idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:07.240]  probiotic.

[03:08:12.920 --> 03:08:35.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:44.600]  Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:49.200]  We are live for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show on this Friday edition and it's
[03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:55.440]  been another week of hot hurt losers trying to overturn election results, trying to overturn
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:57.040]  democratic referendums.
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.840]  We've got yet another example of that today with Brexit which I'm going to get onto.
[03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:06.200]  Absolutely sick of talking about it at this point, it was in June when now five months
[03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:13.040]  later, nearly six months later, there's still no actual date on when article 50 will be
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:17.480]  triggered and that Brexit whole process will begin.
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:22.280]  No date set whatsoever, they're still putting in roadblocks, they're still trying to get
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:29.240]  a second referendum, they're hailing inconsequential by election results, it remains strongholds
[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:33.120]  and hailing them as a sea change in the national sentiment.
[03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:40.240]  Absolute complete BS but BBC News, Sky News is regurgitating it without question as you
[03:09:40.240 --> 03:09:41.240]  would expect.
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:46.320]  Meanwhile, Jill Stein, the political failure who got about 1% of the vote and who nobody
[03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:52.600]  cares about, who her own Green Party has now publicly abandoned her, she's still carrying
[03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:58.840]  on with her useless pointless recount which has no other purpose than trying to prevent
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:05.280]  Donald Trump from winning the election fairly, legitimately, trying to derail his credibility
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:08.360]  as he heads towards the inauguration.
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:14.720]  Well the Wisconsin recount has started and in one county, they tallyed up the vote once
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:21.000]  again, Hillary Clinton finished up with one extra vote, that's right, one extra vote.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:25.800]  I think they tallyed it up and they said the vote would have to continue for about another
[03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:33.080]  70 years at the same course for Hillary Clinton to overturn Donald Trump's margin of victory
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:38.600]  just in Wisconsin alone, so maybe they can keep this going for 70 years, maybe that's
[03:10:38.600 --> 03:10:42.800]  long enough for them to overturn it and you know, they'll probably be happy to do that
[03:10:42.800 --> 03:10:48.320]  because God forbid they would accept the fair result of a democratic election, that's not
[03:10:48.320 --> 03:10:52.280]  what the Democratic Party is all about.
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:57.960]  A Michigan attorney, the Attorney General has filed a lawsuit to halt the recount, and
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:02.640]  this is Michigan Attorney General Bill Shorter filed a lawsuit to stop the recount there,
[03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:08.160]  a move that came out was after Trump attorneys had filed a complaint to block the proceedings.
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:11.480]  So you know, it's going to be harder for them to do it in Michigan, it's going to be even
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:16.560]  harder for them to do it in Pennsylvania but they're dang well going to try because they
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:22.400]  hate democracy, they're sore losers and they're not going to give it up very easily.
[03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:29.320]  In fact we had the story yesterday, you've got electors now reportedly planning, scheming
[03:11:29.320 --> 03:11:35.600]  a coalition of them to vote against the will of the residents of their own state.
[03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:41.680]  So in states that Trump won, these electors on December 19th are not going to vote for
[03:11:41.680 --> 03:11:42.680]  him.
[03:11:42.680 --> 03:11:45.340]  The question is, how many are going to do that?
[03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:50.280]  We saw a report out of Texas where one elector says he's not going to vote for Trump because
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:53.080]  of biblical reasons, whatever the hell that means.
[03:11:53.080 --> 03:11:58.240]  I mean, Christians have been slaughtered in the Middle East on a daily basis, Trump says
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:03.840]  he wants to do something about that, somehow that's un-Christian, God knows how that works.
[03:12:03.840 --> 03:12:05.440]  He's not going to vote for Trump.
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:10.160]  We've got reports of other electors that are getting together again in a coalition and
[03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:13.240]  saying that they're not going to vote for Trump on December 19th.
[03:12:13.240 --> 03:12:14.240]  Is it 15?
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:15.880]  Are there less than 15?
[03:12:15.880 --> 03:12:20.640]  Are there two groups of electors, one of 15, one of 9, 10, 11, 12?
[03:12:20.640 --> 03:12:22.680]  We don't know because they haven't gone public.
[03:12:22.680 --> 03:12:24.680]  Now it's about what?
[03:12:24.680 --> 03:12:29.560]  Two and a half, three weeks before the Electoral College meet, will one of them go public because
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:36.120]  you can bet your bottom dollar that when he or she does, they will get endless media attention
[03:12:36.120 --> 03:12:40.480]  as many interviews as they need on all the major networks to then try and convince other
[03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:45.720]  electors to vote their conscience, in other words, to vote against tens of millions of
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:51.200]  American people who voted for Donald Trump in a fair election, they will get all the
[03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:56.240]  media attention they need, which will then serve perhaps to convince other electors to
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:12:57.600]  do the same.
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:12:58.960]  Is it likely to happen?
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:12:59.960]  No.
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:02.080]  It's a complete long shot.
[03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:08.440]  It's a Hail Mary, but again, it illustrates a complete desperation of Democrats of leftists
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:16.400]  and the severity of the butthurt, the sore losers who whined for weeks about us not accepting
[03:13:16.400 --> 03:13:17.680]  the results of the election.
[03:13:17.680 --> 03:13:21.400]  Oh, the right wingers, they're going to go out and riot if they lose this election.
[03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:22.400]  Who went out and rioted?
[03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:25.640]  Oh, it was you, Hillary Clinton.
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:27.760]  Donald Trump is a threat to democracy.
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:32.040]  He refuses to accept the election result one week after the election result.
[03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:34.760]  Oh, look, Hillary Clinton's involved in this recount.
[03:13:34.760 --> 03:13:37.200]  What a surprise.
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:41.800]  So we've got Hillary ahead by one vote.
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:46.960]  They found one vote for obviously didn't fill in enough blank ballots there, Hillary.
[03:13:46.960 --> 03:13:54.520]  They found one extra vote for Hillary Clinton in this Wisconsin, Menonomy County, 17 extra
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:57.920]  votes for Jill Stein, 12 for Libertarian Gary Johnson again.
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:14:04.520]  I think the estimate was this vote would have to go on for 70 odd years at that rate for
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:08.960]  Hillary Clinton to overturn Donald Trump's margin of victory.
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:15.560]  We have a petition, which is the most popular petition ever that calls to install Hillary
[03:14:15.560 --> 03:14:17.440]  Clinton as president.
[03:14:17.440 --> 03:14:21.520]  It's entitled make Hillary Clinton president posted at change.org.
[03:14:21.520 --> 03:14:26.080]  Now has a total of over 4.6 million signatories at the time of writing, making it the most
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:28.320]  popular petition in the website's history.
[03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:32.520]  It's a shame that all the idiots who signed that petition were too lazy to get off their
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:36.200]  bots and vote three weeks ago, isn't it?
[03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:40.000]  Yeah, actually leaving the house and filling in a piece of paper.
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:45.680]  That was too much for them in the weed-addled stupor, but they can click a few buttons and
[03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:50.840]  sign a petition on the internet and think that that has some kind of weight or importance.
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:52.600]  It doesn't.
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:14:56.520]  The same person probably signed it thousands of times.
[03:14:56.520 --> 03:15:01.920]  Remember the second referendum petitions after Brexit, where they had millions of people
[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:06.480]  sign those turned out that the majority of signatures were from people living in foreign
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:13.160]  countries who could have never voted for Brexit in the first place, but they think that having
[03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:18.320]  a petition on change.org has some kind of weight or importance.
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:20.400]  It doesn't.
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:25.760]  The American Mirror reports Obama worshipers chant four more years at White House Christmas
[03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:32.320]  Relighting. There's only 48 days more for Obama bots to chant admiration for their dear
[03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:33.320]  leader.
[03:15:33.320 --> 03:15:36.520]  They made the most of it as President Obama and his family lit the national Christmas tree
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:38.560]  outside the White House last night.
[03:15:38.560 --> 03:15:43.680]  Attendees could be heard chanting four more years during the ceremony.
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:51.120]  Again, if you put a referendum to these people, asking them if they wanted Obama to be a lifetime
[03:15:51.120 --> 03:15:55.000]  dictator like Kim Jong-il or Kim Jong-un.
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:16:00.920]  The vast majority of them would sign it, and they still call themselves Democrats.
[03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:03.560]  Oh, the irony.
[03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:07.240]  But Brexit, basically, there was a by-election.
[03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:08.800]  The results were announced this morning.
[03:16:08.800 --> 03:16:14.040]  Now, bearing in mind, they had a high court ruling which said that the government had
[03:16:14.040 --> 03:16:18.480]  to pass a parliamentary vote before Brexit could be triggered.
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:24.520]  That's not what the referendum said, and that those judges were all corrupt, EU, thicker
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:25.520]  fans and lackeys.
[03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:28.880]  The same thing is going to happen with the Supreme Court judgment here in a couple of
[03:16:28.880 --> 03:16:29.880]  days' time.
[03:16:29.880 --> 03:16:32.440]  So, they had that already going on in the background.
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:41.120]  So, they had a by-election in an area of London called Richmond, which voted 70% remain, and
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:46.440]  a candidate who won with less than 50% of the vote supported remain.
[03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:53.000]  So, then all the media came out and said that this was a stunning repudiation of Brexit
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.240]  sentiment across the country.
[03:16:55.240 --> 03:17:02.760]  Okay, so, an area in which 70% of the population voted remain votes for somebody who gets less
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:08.840]  than 50% of the vote, and that represents the entirety of the country and how they've
[03:17:08.840 --> 03:17:11.520]  suddenly changed their mind on Brexit.
[03:17:11.520 --> 03:17:14.480]  Give me a break, okay?
[03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:21.640]  Sky News, which is worse than the BBC in many aspects, they lie consistently about Brexit.
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:26.280]  Williams vowed to fight hard Brexit after Richmond by-election win.
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:29.760]  The Liberal Democrats have vowed to fight against a hard Brexit in the aftermath of the party's
[03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:31.600]  stunning victory.
[03:17:31.600 --> 03:17:39.760]  It was absolutely stunning, it was like 20,000 votes, oh my God, compared to 17.4 million
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:45.200]  British people who voted for Brexit, yet they're saying that this is a stunning victory.
[03:17:45.200 --> 03:17:49.800]  It's a massive sea change in the entire sentiment of the country.
[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:57.160]  So this MP called Sarah Olney, who then later gave a radio interview in which she walked
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:03.840]  off because she had zero knowledge of the EU, of the actual issues relating to the referendum.
[03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:08.760]  She won a by-election and then got on the media and said that this result paved the
[03:18:08.760 --> 03:18:16.160]  way for Parliament to, quote, override the EU referendum result.
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:22.480]  Isn't that ironic that she's a member of the Liberal Democrats, key word being Democrats,
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:29.720]  and she's on the media talking about overriding the democratic will of the British people?
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:32.160]  Give me strength.
[03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:39.880]  But again, this is monumental, 20,000 people voted for her, and again, where's the second
[03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:40.880]  vote, right?
[03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:46.080]  This is the same woman who called for a second referendum immediately after Brexit.
[03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:50.360]  Now these people were low information who voted in Richmond.
[03:18:50.360 --> 03:18:51.480]  They were swayed.
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:57.040]  They were deluded by lies from extreme left-wing propaganda outlets like The Guardian.
[03:18:57.040 --> 03:19:00.200]  So I think it's only fair that we have a second vote.
[03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:02.000]  I mean, who would oppose that?
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:04.720]  Only people who hate democracy would oppose that.
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:07.720]  Only intolerant bigots would oppose that.
[03:19:07.720 --> 03:19:09.680]  So she walked off this interview.
[03:19:09.680 --> 03:19:11.760]  Again, it's a remain area.
[03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:17.440]  No surprise whatsoever, yet the media is hailing it as this massive sea change in the sentiment
[03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:20.840]  of the country, such BS.
[03:19:20.840 --> 03:19:29.880]  How on earth is that reversal of Brexit sentiment when the people in the area voted 70% for Brexit?
[03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:34.320]  Oh, and by the way, those are the same people who lectured the rest of the country about
[03:19:34.320 --> 03:19:39.760]  how intolerant and bigoted they were because they were anti-mass immigration.
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:43.000]  This is literally the whitest area of London.
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:47.760]  So they preach all day about the virtues, the wonders of mass immigration, while choosing
[03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:52.000]  to live in the whitest area possible.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:53.680]  And that is the root of their hypocrisy.
[03:19:53.680 --> 03:19:55.680]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live.
[03:19:55.680 --> 03:19:56.920]  Don't go away.
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:03.240]  I want to tell you about a brand new Off The Grid product.
[03:20:03.240 --> 03:20:05.360]  It's a pocket-sized solar generator.
[03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:07.320]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket.
[03:20:07.320 --> 03:20:12.440]  It can actually run some 110 appliances at your house, like small refrigerators to keep
[03:20:12.440 --> 03:20:13.440]  your food from spoiling.
[03:20:13.440 --> 03:20:16.320]  The best part, though, you can take it with you.
[03:20:16.320 --> 03:20:21.960]  It's mobile to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[03:20:21.960 --> 03:20:26.400]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of Off The Grid electricity, basically creating
[03:20:26.400 --> 03:20:28.760]  your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:29.760]  A true innovation.
[03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:31.960]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:33.600]  You're going to want to load up on these.
[03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:37.640]  Even for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin, it's even a great Christmas idea
[03:20:37.640 --> 03:20:40.080]  if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[03:22:03.680 --> 03:22:07.240]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[03:22:07.240 --> 03:22:09.720]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:14.040]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of
[03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:15.040]  them.
[03:22:15.040 --> 03:22:16.520]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:16.520 --> 03:22:20.800]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects
[03:22:20.800 --> 03:22:22.280]  of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:26.520]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary

[03:22:38.200 --> 03:22:44.080]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics, so the body is an amazing thing.

[03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:02.680]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:23:02.680 --> 03:23:05.080]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:27.680]  Illustrated by the success of Donald Trump, illustrated by the fact that Francois Hollande,
[03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:33.040]  the socialist French president who has completely ruined that country, basically turned it into
[03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:40.880]  one giant Islamic ghetto, now has 4% approval rating and is so despised in France that for
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:46.600]  the first time ever in the history of the 5th Republic of France, the sitting president
[03:24:46.600 --> 03:24:53.440]  is not going to run for reelection because he's that unpopular, he's wrecked the country
[03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:58.920]  to such a degree that he has no chance whatsoever of winning.
[03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:04.000]  So then they've got this Pheon candidate in there who's basically all talk and no action.
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:09.200]  He says he's going to take on radical Islam, has no actual policy on how to do that, obviously
[03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:16.080]  a ringer to try and distract from, to try and derail the success of Marine Le Pen.
[03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:21.160]  You've got a situation over in Italy where they have a huge rejection, repudiation of
[03:25:21.160 --> 03:25:28.280]  the government coming up, if polls are to be believed on Sunday, again, they fear, they
[03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:31.800]  fear it could destroy the European Union, like that's a bad thing.
[03:25:31.800 --> 03:25:37.280]  So we have this conservative populist revolution sweeping Europe and in the UK they have won
[03:25:37.280 --> 03:25:43.440]  by election victory because the conservative member stood down from the conservative party
[03:25:43.440 --> 03:25:49.520]  and ran as an independent, Zach Goldsmith, who specializes in losing elections.
[03:25:49.520 --> 03:25:56.200]  They win this election, about 20,000 people vote for this liberal Democrat who wants to
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:26:01.680]  override the democratic will of the British people and the media comes out and says it's
[03:26:01.680 --> 03:26:05.560]  a historic moment for the country.
[03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:13.640]  One little area that voted 70% remain in the first place, votes as you would expect for
[03:26:13.640 --> 03:26:18.440]  this remain candidate, but it's a stunning rejection of Brexit.
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:25.840]  The media is literally telling British people that 20,000 posh lefties in Richmond represent
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:33.480]  the country better than 17.4 million Brexit voters.
[03:26:33.480 --> 03:26:37.800]  It's an insane level of propaganda, but you're never going to hear a word against it because
[03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:43.200]  we don't have a real media in this country that isn't completely biased and left wing.
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:51.120]  Sky News fanes as if it's right of the BBC when it's even worse than the BBC.
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:55.480]  There's no news station like Fox News, which isn't brilliant, but at least it's something
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:26:59.400]  there's absolutely nothing like that in the United Kingdom and people just don't hear
[03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:01.600]  this kind of information.
[03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:06.880]  The Telegraph reports top EU official claims shot result is a win for Remain, as Ian Duncan-Smith
[03:27:06.880 --> 03:27:09.600]  tells him to mind his own bloody business.
[03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:16.280]  This is Guy Verhofstadt, the rat-faced unelected bureaucrat, former commie, who sits in the
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:23.800]  EU, is now sticking his nose into British by-elections, gloating about how this is such a massive
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:25.800]  victory.
[03:27:25.800 --> 03:27:30.360]  Philip Davis, another Conservative MP, said, I'm happy for them to make this result a referendum
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:35.920]  on the EU, as the EU referendum over 70% voted for Remain.
[03:27:35.920 --> 03:27:41.920]  At this by-election, the Lib Dems got less than 50%, seems like a big swing from Remain
[03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:42.920]  to leave.
[03:27:42.920 --> 03:27:48.320]  Again, they got 20% less of the vote than they did for Remain in this same area, but
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:53.800]  these unelected rat-faced commie bureaucrats in the EU are hailing it as a repudiation
[03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:54.800]  of Brexit.
[03:27:54.800 --> 03:27:58.480]  Well, it's anything but.
[03:27:58.480 --> 03:28:00.120]  So again, you've got that going on.
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:08.320]  You have a situation in Canada where the taxpayer-funded news network, CBC, has produced what can
[03:28:08.320 --> 03:28:12.920]  only be described as an absolutely bizarre racist video.
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:15.880]  This is out of information liberation.
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:20.160]  Canadian state TV hails beige horizon with no white people.
[03:28:20.160 --> 03:28:26.920]  Imagine if a taxpayer-funded news network, television network, came out with a rap video
[03:28:26.920 --> 03:28:30.520]  hailing the extinction of black people.
[03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:32.400]  I mean, how would that fly?
[03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:37.960]  Yet, the CBC has produced a bizarre music video hailing an inevitable future where white
[03:28:37.960 --> 03:28:46.560]  people are made extinct, actually use racist terms like Mexi-Jews, Chonkeys, and Beena
[03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:52.600]  schnitzels while attacking Donald Trump and Stephen Bannon as racists for their perceived
[03:28:52.600 --> 03:28:54.800]  relationship with the alt-right.
[03:28:54.800 --> 03:29:00.520]  So again, these are the people who celebrate diversity, yet in the very lyrics of this racist
[03:29:00.520 --> 03:29:06.560]  rap song, they say they're looking forward to the day where everyone looks the same.
[03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:09.240]  Really, that's diversity, is it?
[03:29:09.240 --> 03:29:10.240]  Everyone looking the same.
[03:29:10.240 --> 03:29:14.000]  I suppose they all have the same opinions too, because you won't tolerate diversity
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:16.160]  of opinion, will you?
[03:29:16.160 --> 03:29:18.280]  Again, this was on YouTube.
[03:29:18.280 --> 03:29:25.200]  It got 16,000 downvotes compared to just 82 upvotes, and the comments were so vitriolic
[03:29:25.200 --> 03:29:26.800]  they had to disable the comments.
[03:29:26.800 --> 03:29:32.920]  One of the comments said, the video highlighted a contradiction with the idea that race doesn't
[03:29:32.920 --> 03:29:35.800]  exist but white people alone need to die.
[03:29:35.800 --> 03:29:42.000]  So again, it's this idea that the only, the last acceptable form of racism is racism against
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:43.000]  white people.
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:46.600]  We're all for diversity, apart from white people, they all need to die.
[03:29:46.600 --> 03:29:50.760]  That is PBC, we'll be back on the Alex Jones show, don't go away.
[03:30:16.600 --> 03:30:25.440]  We're becoming a globalized world, but the relationships people that in this country
[03:30:25.440 --> 03:30:32.560]  are local, family, city, state, country, they're local.
[03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:41.200]  There is no global effort, no global currency, no certificate of global citizenship.
[03:30:41.200 --> 03:30:49.120]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[03:30:49.120 --> 03:30:59.000]  Then you can watch this speech in its entirety right now and in FullWars.com.
[03:30:59.000 --> 03:31:03.960]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and
[03:31:03.960 --> 03:31:04.960]  nutraceuticals.
[03:31:04.960 --> 03:31:10.000]  Young Jevity integrates years of scientific research into creating fantastic products

[03:31:59.760 --> 03:32:27.960]  There was a mighty nation blessed above all of creation.
[03:32:27.960 --> 03:32:33.360]  It's time to ride, boys, we need a thousand paul revere's.
[03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:39.400]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:32:39.400 --> 03:32:41.880]  And beef was for supper.
[03:32:41.880 --> 03:32:47.960]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[03:32:47.960 --> 03:32:53.480]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin, wanna shed some
[03:32:53.480 --> 03:32:56.360]  tears over the red, white and blue?
[03:32:56.360 --> 03:33:11.760]  Listen to the movie.info, let's fix it.
[03:33:11.760 --> 03:33:17.080]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:33:17.080 --> 03:33:21.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:21.080 --> 03:33:30.480]  My friends, Alex Jones here with one final message for this Friday worldwide broadcast
[03:33:30.480 --> 03:33:34.440]  and it's this, I'm very thankful for this audience.
[03:33:34.440 --> 03:33:37.960]  I'm very thankful to the great crew and people like Paul Watson.
[03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:44.680]  I am very thankful to your prayers and support and I'm very thankful to our founders who
[03:33:44.680 --> 03:33:49.560]  laid down the right of free speech and the right to assemble the right of private property.
[03:33:49.560 --> 03:33:56.960]  And of course, the right to not just defend ourselves with free speech, but also defend
[03:33:56.960 --> 03:33:59.400]  ourselves physically as a last resort.
[03:33:59.400 --> 03:34:01.520]  And of course, they didn't give us those rights.
[03:34:01.520 --> 03:34:07.000]  They simply laid out some of the basic known rights under common law and under natural
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:10.320]  law and common sense and we need to see a return to that.
[03:34:10.320 --> 03:34:14.680]  But the reason I wanted to add this addendum earlier, I discussed the fact that we have
[03:34:14.680 --> 03:34:19.640]  to now boycott Kellogg's and every other globalist organization that is openly funding the end
[03:34:19.640 --> 03:34:24.520]  of free press in this country while funding a radical terrorist groups that are out killing
[03:34:24.520 --> 03:34:25.520]  police officers.
[03:34:25.520 --> 03:34:27.280]  And this is a foreign takeover.
[03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:28.280]  That is not rhetoric.
[03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:30.200]  This is really happening.
[03:34:30.200 --> 03:34:34.080]  And there's one other big piece I didn't get to dealing with this congressional funding
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:40.680]  that passed the house for $170 million for a domestic news control system that makes
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:46.400]  operation Mockingbird by the CIA paling significance, and that's what we also have Yahoo coming
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:47.400]  out.
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:51.280]  And I've seen other publications saying this, that they have to start indoctrinating children
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:53.800]  in school against fake news.
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:57.080]  Yeah, you'll probably tell us there's no such thing as the Bilderberg group or that
[03:34:57.080 --> 03:35:02.560]  Obamacare's free or that Trump's going to lose the election and put out some fake polls.
[03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:09.180]  This really is the dying gas of these people, but they could lash out and really hurt us.
[03:35:09.180 --> 03:35:13.160]  That's why I'm saying everybody's done a great job, but you've got to intensify what
[03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:14.160]  you're doing.
[03:35:14.160 --> 03:35:17.320]  And if you're black, you've got to reach out to folks that are white and Hispanic.
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:21.560]  Yeah, if you're white, you've got to do your vice versa, Hispanic vice versa.
[03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:27.360]  They are just sowing the seeds of such division and such pain and such mental illness in a
[03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:31.800]  desperate attempt to keep us from discovering true free market that is so much better than
[03:35:31.800 --> 03:35:34.040]  globalism and total enslavement.
[03:35:34.040 --> 03:35:37.480]  But man, when you're talking about openly state-run media, we already know from Wiki
[03:35:37.480 --> 03:35:45.480]  leaks that CNN, ABC, CBS, MSNBC are basically state-run, but now it's going to be so much
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:51.040]  worse with them openly coordinating an Obama calling for state funding and Rolling Stone
[03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:54.120]  earlier this week to run state-run media.
[03:35:54.120 --> 03:36:01.240]  I mean, this is so classically dangerous and authoritarian.
[03:36:01.240 --> 03:36:06.160]  And so that's why it's so important that everybody realize that we have a case of political cancer
[03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:10.680]  in Southern Europe and we have to get rid of these arrogant, unelected, out-of-control
[03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:11.680]  organizations.
[03:36:11.680 --> 03:36:12.680]  It is so imperative.
[03:36:12.680 --> 03:36:17.920]  I want to get Paul Watson's take on this as he goes on to other news today, and of course
[03:36:17.920 --> 03:36:23.760]  the other great host that have done a great job roundtabling like David Knight, Lionel,
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:25.000]  and so many others.
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:30.880]  And then of course, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:34.480]  Again, Lord willing, because in days like this, who knows?
[03:36:34.480 --> 03:36:37.840]  That's why I want to thank you all for your support over the years, and just want to ask
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:42.640]  you to intensify your support, spreading the videos, the articles, purchasing the products,
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:46.920]  supporting our sponsors, because this is an all-out war, and it's not exhausting to
[03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:47.920]  fight this war.
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:48.920]  It's animating.
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:49.920]  It's exciting.
[03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:51.640]  Wild horses cannot drag me away.
[03:36:51.640 --> 03:36:53.000]  And so again, I salute you all.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:54.600]  I thank you, and I love you all.
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:36:58.680]  Alex Jones, signing off for infowars.com.
[03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:02.080]  And Alex mentioned their headline, which we've got up on infowars.com.
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:07.240]  Yahoo News columnists want schools to indoctrinate kids to trust mainstream media.
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:12.800]  This is the solution to fake news, or in other words, the fact that we're kicking their butt
[03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:18.960]  on every single front, winning the info war, as Hillary Clinton lamented years ago.
[03:37:18.960 --> 03:37:23.000]  With trust in mainstream media outlets plunging to historic lows, a Yahoo News columnist has
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:28.320]  an ingenious idea to restore faith in the MSN, indoctrinate children in schools to only place
[03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:31.000]  confidence in the corporate press.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:38.440]  So he wants basically a media literacy class, mandatory in all schools, all high schools,
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:44.800]  so that youngsters just get a sense of what's real news and what's fake news, and of course
[03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:48.800]  the only news they can trust is the Washington Post, is Yahoo News.
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:49.800]  Well, what a surprise.
[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:51.520]  Again, how about this?
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:56.080]  How about instead of labeling everyone who has a different opinion as fake news, how
[03:37:56.080 --> 03:37:58.080]  about you stop lying?
[03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:03.960]  You know, he uses the example of the Washington Post article, which had this proper or not
[03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:07.000]  fake news list, Russian propaganda list.
[03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:13.480]  That article has been vehemently debunked and eviscerated by innumerable different news
[03:38:13.480 --> 03:38:15.600]  outlets since it came out.
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:22.760]  They put left-wing news websites on this list that were mildly critical of Hillary Clinton
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:25.880]  and called it Russian propaganda.
[03:38:25.880 --> 03:38:27.480]  That's propaganda right there.
[03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:29.080]  That is state propaganda.
[03:38:29.080 --> 03:38:32.080]  That is democratic party propaganda.
[03:38:32.080 --> 03:38:33.480]  You're the fake news.
[03:38:33.480 --> 03:38:38.280]  They're the fake news while pointing fingers all day telling us that we are the fake news.
[03:38:38.280 --> 03:38:42.720]  The difference between fake news, which does exist, there are fake news websites that put
[03:38:42.720 --> 03:38:44.600]  out fake news to make money.
[03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:49.840]  The difference is, the most harm that happens with fake news is they make a few advertising
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:50.840]  dollars.
[03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:56.720]  When the mainstream media puts out fake news, hundreds of thousands of people die, okay?
[03:38:56.720 --> 03:38:58.680]  That's the frigging difference.
[03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:03.640]  You put out fake news about mobile biological weapons laboratories.
[03:39:03.640 --> 03:39:09.200]  You know, Saddam Hussein's drone aircraft that can spray anthrax over wide areas.
[03:39:09.200 --> 03:39:10.520]  Complete BS.
[03:39:10.520 --> 03:39:15.320]  Colin Powell holding up a vial of anthrax in front of the UN.
[03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:22.680]  Complete BS saying that Iraq had these mobile weapons labs based on known liars as sources.
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:23.680]  Okay?
[03:39:23.680 --> 03:39:25.640]  That's fake news.
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:30.560]  You put it out, Washington Post, New York Times, hundreds of thousands of people died.
[03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:32.280]  That is the difference.
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:36.720]  You can talk about Dan Rather, you can talk about Brian Williams, talk about Hillary Clinton
[03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:39.200]  being under, you know, fake sniper fire.
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:41.880]  Again, that's fake news.
[03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:44.040]  That has real consequences.
[03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:50.240]  People making a few advertising books off some made up headlines isn't really much of a threat
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:54.960]  unless you then try and exploit that as the mainstream media, as you've lost all your
[03:39:54.960 --> 03:39:59.640]  trust and credibility because you lie and come out with fake news.
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:06.400]  You can exploit that and use it again to list, blacklist your detractors as fake news along
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:11.320]  with actual fake news when in reality it's basically anyone who has a different opinion.
[03:40:11.320 --> 03:40:18.120]  Look, I'm still waiting for my check from the Kremlin, but it hasn't arrived yet.
[03:40:18.120 --> 03:40:24.800]  I mean, I'm sick of reading how, you know, oh, you're a cuck because you don't say that
[03:40:24.800 --> 03:40:27.160]  white supremacy is the way to go.
[03:40:27.160 --> 03:40:28.160]  You're a cuck.
[03:40:28.160 --> 03:40:31.360]  You're being controlled by the left and then the left says, oh, you're a neo-Nazi, you're
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:32.360]  a bigger.
[03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:33.360]  I'm sick of it.
[03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:34.360]  Okay?
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:36.680]  We try to tell the truth as we see it.
[03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:37.680]  Do we make mistakes?
[03:40:37.680 --> 03:40:38.680]  Yes.
[03:40:38.680 --> 03:40:43.120]  Do we deliberately create fake headlines and fake stories for advertising dollars?
[03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:44.120]  No.
[03:40:44.120 --> 03:40:49.440]  We make money to, we make our own money and it doesn't come in the form of checks from
[03:40:49.440 --> 03:40:54.800]  corrupt governments, unlike CNN, of course, which takes checks from the corrupt dictatorship
[03:40:54.800 --> 03:41:00.960]  of Bahrain to make puff-piece propaganda programs about how great their government is while
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:03.480]  they're literally killing protesters on the streets.
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:04.480]  Okay?
[03:41:04.480 --> 03:41:05.480]  We don't need that money.
[03:41:05.480 --> 03:41:06.600]  We don't take those checks.
[03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:07.600]  You do.
[03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:10.280]  You're the fake news.
[03:41:10.280 --> 03:41:14.160]  Before we get back into the news, I want to tell you about Infowarsstore.com again.
[03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:15.520]  This is how we make money.
[03:41:15.520 --> 03:41:20.400]  We don't take checks from George Soros, like Black Lives Matter, like MoveOn.org.
[03:41:20.400 --> 03:41:21.880]  This is how we make money.
[03:41:21.880 --> 03:41:23.560]  This is how we buy the cameras.
[03:41:23.560 --> 03:41:28.300]  This is how we pay tens of thousands in bandwidth costs every week.
[03:41:28.300 --> 03:41:32.040]  This is how we pay our staff of writers, of reporters.
[03:41:32.040 --> 03:41:37.280]  This is how we become a real news organization that takes on the mainstream media is by selling
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:41.160]  vitamin products, oh, God forbid.
[03:41:41.160 --> 03:41:45.480]  So please support us by getting the products at Infowarslife.com, where we have vitamin,
[03:41:45.480 --> 03:41:50.120]  mineral, fusion, drink, and just appreciate this because over in the EU, they've basically
[03:41:50.120 --> 03:41:55.040]  banned vitamins in any kind of high strength, so you can't even get them anymore.
[03:41:55.040 --> 03:42:01.640]  So before the authoritarians come for this, just appreciate what you can get at Infowarslife.com.
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:04.840]  And this is the affordable and great tasting vitamin, mineral, fusion, drink.
[03:42:04.840 --> 03:42:08.800]  It's back in stock, it's loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals,
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:11.120]  and amino acids that your body needs.
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:15.960]  The best part is the ingredients in vitamin, mineral, fusion are either plant derived or
[03:42:15.960 --> 03:42:18.400]  of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:42:18.400 --> 03:42:23.280]  We're talking vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, elglutamine, folic acid,
[03:42:23.280 --> 03:42:24.840]  calcium, and many others.
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:26.800]  Again, this is a limited run.
[03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:27.880]  It won't be there for long.
[03:42:27.880 --> 03:42:30.760]  It's available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:34.920]  God forbid you would make yourself want to feel a little bit better and improve your health
[03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:37.720]  while supporting our network.
[03:42:37.720 --> 03:42:42.240]  God forbid you would want to do that, we're so discredited because we sell vitamins.
[03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:43.920]  God forbid, shame on us.
[03:42:43.920 --> 03:42:50.960]  We don't take checks from corrupt Gulf State dictatorships or billionaire globalist financiers
[03:42:50.960 --> 03:42:55.720]  like moveon.org, like Media Matters, like Think Progress, but they're so credible, we're
[03:42:55.720 --> 03:42:56.720]  fake news.
[03:42:56.720 --> 03:43:01.120]  Okay, let's get back into the real news.
[03:43:01.120 --> 03:43:03.440]  Again, Brexit is going on.
[03:43:03.440 --> 03:43:04.720]  They're trying to sabotage that.
[03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:06.280]  It's not happening once again.
[03:43:06.280 --> 03:43:11.400]  You've got a cocked conservative government, many of whom campaign against Brexit in the
[03:43:11.400 --> 03:43:14.720]  first place, now being tasked with carrying it out.
[03:43:14.720 --> 03:43:22.120]  Meanwhile, in Ohio earlier this week, we had a terrorist ram innocent people with a vehicle
[03:43:22.120 --> 03:43:24.360]  then get out and start slashing them.
[03:43:24.360 --> 03:43:29.520]  It since turned out that, imagine my shock, he was a social justice warrior.
[03:43:29.520 --> 03:43:30.520]  That's right.
[03:43:30.520 --> 03:43:35.440]  Remember, we had the ISIS manifesto back, I think it was about six, seven months ago
[03:43:35.440 --> 03:43:39.400]  now where they actually came out and said, this was ISIS in their own manifesto.
[03:43:39.400 --> 03:43:46.320]  They came out and said, left wing social justice activists broadly share the same goals as
[03:43:46.320 --> 03:43:47.800]  jihadists.
[03:43:47.800 --> 03:43:54.200]  So let's take over Europe, recruit them, radicalize them and arm them to carry out violent
[03:43:54.200 --> 03:43:56.280]  terrorist attacks.
[03:43:56.280 --> 03:44:01.360]  Because again, social justice warriors and jihadists broadly share the same goals, not
[03:44:01.360 --> 03:44:05.900]  my words, the words of ISIS in their own manifesto.
[03:44:05.900 --> 03:44:11.680]  So no surprise that we had that happen again earlier this week at Ohio State University,
[03:44:11.680 --> 03:44:17.720]  where it turned out that the terrorist Mr. Artan, the peace-loving religion of peace,
[03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:23.960]  Somali immigrant, was studying microaggressions as part of his university course.
[03:44:23.960 --> 03:44:28.920]  Microaggressions is this bizarre branch of political correctness, which basically says
[03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:35.480]  a white person smiling at a black person is a microaggression, it's politically incorrect.
[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:41.500]  Again, anything that could be taken as offensive towards any minority whatsoever, any kind
[03:44:41.500 --> 03:44:45.920]  of mundane phrase or behavior, that's a microaggression.
[03:44:45.920 --> 03:44:51.440]  That's what Mr. Artan, jihadist, was studying right before this attack.
[03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:56.600]  The same guy who was whining about Islamophobia and Muslims being mistreated right before
[03:44:56.600 --> 03:44:57.600]  the attack.
[03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:04.960]  Part of his radicalization process came from his involvement in social justice issues.
[03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:11.880]  We now have a direct connection between jihadism and social justice warriors, and it's not
[03:45:11.880 --> 03:45:13.720]  the first time this has happened.
[03:45:13.720 --> 03:45:19.840]  But Faith Goldie of rebel media went to the university, talked to people and just wait
[03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:22.920]  and see what they said, let's roll this clip.
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:28.880]  I'm here at Ohio State University, which has just become the setting of ISIS's most recent
[03:45:28.880 --> 03:45:36.040]  terrorist attack on US soil, committed by one Abdul Artan, he's a Somalian refugee.
[03:45:36.040 --> 03:45:41.080]  Now it should be pointed out that this terrorist attack comes just two months after another
[03:45:41.080 --> 03:45:47.040]  knife terrorist attack in Minnesota that was perpetrated by the son of Somalian refugees.
[03:45:47.040 --> 03:45:51.440]  I figured we'd walk around campus and ask students if they're shaken up by recent events
[03:45:51.440 --> 03:45:56.520]  here in their own backyard, or if the occasional terrorist attack is just a small price we
[03:45:56.520 --> 03:45:58.520]  have to pay for multiculturalism.
[03:45:58.520 --> 03:46:01.560]  Do you feel safe on campus after the attack this week?
[03:46:01.560 --> 03:46:02.560]  Yep.
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:03.560]  You do?
[03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:06.880]  Would you call it a terrorist attack?
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:09.080]  Depends on what your definition of terrorism is.
[03:46:09.080 --> 03:46:10.080]  According to your definition?
[03:46:10.080 --> 03:46:11.080]  No.
[03:46:11.080 --> 03:46:13.640]  Would you call what happened terrorism?
[03:46:13.640 --> 03:46:15.600]  I don't see, I don't know what happened yet.
[03:46:15.600 --> 03:46:20.040]  I don't know what it's about, and I think we still have a lot to learn about the incident.
[03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:22.200]  ISIS has claimed responsibility.
[03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:27.880]  I do realize that, but that doesn't always mean that's what necessarily happened.
[03:46:27.880 --> 03:46:30.040]  Would you call this terrorism?
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:31.040]  I'm not sure.
[03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:34.680]  I've been just kind of like keeping updated with the news.
[03:46:34.680 --> 03:46:38.120]  I'm not sure, like if they've confirmed that or denied that.
[03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:39.520]  ISIS claimed responsibility?
[03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:42.000]  Yeah, so I don't know.
[03:46:42.000 --> 03:46:43.560]  Would you call it happened terrorism?
[03:46:43.560 --> 03:46:44.560]  No, I wouldn't.
[03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:45.560]  No.
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:46.560]  It was a misunderstanding.
[03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:47.560]  A misunderstanding?
[03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:50.560]  Why would you say that?
[03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:58.640]  Because I think that person probably experienced a lot of racism, and racism is a traumatic
[03:46:58.640 --> 03:47:05.000]  experience, and I hope that people that look like him and who don't look like me feel safe
[03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:06.920]  on campus too.
[03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:10.320]  Do you think that it's fair game to bring up his religion?
[03:47:10.320 --> 03:47:16.440]  I mean, I think that it's kind of dangerous to bring up his religion, because yeah, he
[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:22.800]  was a Muslim, but that doesn't mean that all Muslims are bad, and we should be afraid
[03:47:22.800 --> 03:47:23.800]  of all of them.
[03:47:23.800 --> 03:47:29.040]  Do you think it's fair game to bring up the man's religion?
[03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:35.040]  I mean, I think that needs to be separate from the rest of what you're looking at.
[03:47:35.040 --> 03:47:41.640]  I think if it's clear that it's a terrorist attack, as far as how it was inspired, then
[03:47:41.640 --> 03:47:44.520]  I think you go off of that, not off for religion.
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:51.120]  I guess I would say, you know, until we know more what role his religion played in the incident,
[03:47:51.120 --> 03:47:54.480]  if any, I think we can stay away from that.
[03:47:54.480 --> 03:47:58.160]  Did you read his Facebook post that he posted right before committing the attack?
[03:47:58.160 --> 03:47:59.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:47:59.400 --> 03:48:00.400]  I think they're ambiguous.
[03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:05.400]  I mean, you know, lots of people probably say those same sorts of things, probably hundreds
[03:48:05.400 --> 03:48:10.800]  of thousands of people, and don't do terrorist attacks, so I'm not sure that they're related.
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:15.600]  Now, do you think that this is just a sort of thing that we're going to have to accept
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:16.600]  going forward?
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:21.640]  It's just a price to pay for being a multicultural, diverse, and tolerant society?
[03:48:21.640 --> 03:48:27.240]  I mean, yeah, probably, like, when you're accepting people from all different, like,
[03:48:27.240 --> 03:48:31.800]  walks of life and different races and religions, like, there are bad people.
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:36.280]  Sometimes people are bad, and, like, it's going to happen.
[03:48:36.280 --> 03:48:42.120]  It's not because one group is worse than another, it's just because bad people exist.
[03:48:42.120 --> 03:48:45.440]  So you would say that Islam is the same as any other religion?
[03:48:45.440 --> 03:48:46.440]  Yeah.
[03:48:46.440 --> 03:48:51.800]  Like, there are radical Christians, and just, any religion is going to have extremists,
[03:48:51.800 --> 03:48:57.000]  and just because they're Muslim doesn't mean that, oh, suddenly all Muslims are bad.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:01.160]  Do you, who do you think is the bigger victim here, the 11 injured or the Somali community
[03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:02.720]  who's lost someone?
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:09.400]  Well, I, you know, obviously, I hate to, you know, rank victimhood.
[03:49:09.400 --> 03:49:14.800]  The people who got hurt, that was terrible, and the good news is I think they're all going
[03:49:14.800 --> 03:49:16.280]  to recover.
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:22.120]  The Somali community, I think a lot of, I feel, you know, I feel sorry, we'll know more
[03:49:22.120 --> 03:49:27.400]  when we know what happened and what was going on, I hope that they can recover from this
[03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:28.920]  as well.
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:33.640]  I'm sure that, you know, the man's family evidently didn't know anything about this.
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:40.720]  I'm sure that they felt horrible to lose their son and brother and so forth.
[03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:45.640]  So I think, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of sympathy to go around, I guess.
[03:49:45.640 --> 03:49:46.640]  Are you a student here?
[03:49:46.640 --> 03:49:48.120]  No, I'm a faculty member.
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:53.440]  Well, you can chalk it up to ignorance, inhibition, or even indoctrination, but it would seem
[03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:58.680]  folks here on the ground at OSU are unwilling to admit to come to terms and to cope with
[03:49:58.680 --> 03:50:04.760]  the fact that Islamic terrorists have just targeted their own backyard.
[03:50:04.760 --> 03:50:10.440]  So again, the guy wrote a Facebook post saying why he did this, he wanted to kill the infidels.
[03:50:10.440 --> 03:50:15.600]  ISIS claimed responsibility, but God forbid you would mention that he was a Muslim because
[03:50:15.600 --> 03:50:18.040]  that has nothing whatsoever to do with it.
[03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:22.600]  Of course, what has more to do with it is the fact that America is racist and that's
[03:50:22.600 --> 03:50:24.120]  what made him carry out this attack.
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:29.640]  In fact, America is so racist that it gave this guy free healthcare, free housing, free
[03:50:29.640 --> 03:50:32.280]  education and food stamps.
[03:50:32.280 --> 03:50:34.720]  But that just wasn't quite enough, was it?
[03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:39.360]  Still a little bit too much racism towards the individual and that, according to these
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:45.040]  students at Ohio State University, justified the attack.
[03:50:45.040 --> 03:50:47.640]  This is the insanity that we are up against.
[03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:51.600]  We're going to get back into it after the break on the final segment of the Alex Jones
[03:50:51.600 --> 03:51:00.240]  show, breaking news at infowalls.com, don't go away.

[03:51:04.920 --> 03:51:07.120]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[03:51:07.120 --> 03:51:09.080]  Find your happiness with pure soap.

[03:54:22.440 --> 03:54:23.680]  break again.
[03:54:23.680 --> 03:54:28.680]  Islam had nothing to do with the attack at Ohio State University earlier this week.
[03:54:28.680 --> 03:54:35.240]  Even though the attacker wrote a Facebook post explaining how he wanted to kill the infidels
[03:54:35.240 --> 03:54:40.720]  even though the Islamic State the day after the attack claimed it as their own.
[03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:47.800]  But again it's taboo to even mention the word Islam and in fact isn't it America that's
[03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:53.880]  to blame for an Islamic radical ramming a car into innocent people and then slashing
[03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:54.880]  them.
[03:54:54.880 --> 03:54:56.760]  Isn't it Americans that are to blame for that?
[03:54:56.760 --> 03:55:00.400]  They were a little bit too racist, didn't give him enough food stamps, didn't give him
[03:55:00.400 --> 03:55:05.600]  enough free education, housing or health care, a little bit racist there and we should be
[03:55:05.600 --> 03:55:11.560]  thinking about mean tweets about all the American migrants in the aftermath of this.
[03:55:11.560 --> 03:55:15.480]  We should be sympathizing with the terrorist family really shouldn't we?
[03:55:15.480 --> 03:55:18.760]  Not the actual victims of the terrorist attack.
[03:55:18.760 --> 03:55:22.960]  Yes that's what they actually said in that clip.
[03:55:22.960 --> 03:55:29.400]  These universities are the breeding grounds for absolute unbridled insanity and we've
[03:55:29.400 --> 03:55:32.360]  kind of eviscerated it in the popular culture to some extent.
[03:55:32.360 --> 03:55:37.840]  We've kind of eviscerated it in the media world but it's still as virulent as ever in
[03:55:37.840 --> 03:55:44.360]  these universities and in fact the day after this attack NPR gave a platform to another
[03:55:44.360 --> 03:55:50.720]  Somali migrant who basically came out and said that again unpleasant tweets and perhaps
[03:55:50.720 --> 03:55:55.560]  mean stares were the biggest threat in the aftermath of this attack.
[03:55:55.560 --> 03:55:59.080]  Not the fact that these attacks are now happening on a regular basis.
[03:55:59.080 --> 03:56:04.160]  You had a Somali American migrant in a mall believe it was in Minneapolis just a few
[03:56:04.160 --> 03:56:12.120]  months before this again go on a rampage thankfully shot dead by a responsible person with a gun.
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:16.640]  This is happening more and more frequently but they're now saying that it's racist to
[03:56:16.640 --> 03:56:23.280]  even mention any connection whatsoever to Islam while the attacker makes Facebook posts
[03:56:23.280 --> 03:56:30.680]  about how it's driven by Islam and while the Islamic State claims responsibility.
[03:56:30.680 --> 03:56:34.320]  Meanwhile you've got a group which has come out with basically a propaganda ad that says
[03:56:34.320 --> 03:56:41.880]  it's time we all take a stand against hate it's time we all spread love.
[03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:47.120]  We're again blaming this attack on the intolerance of Americans while I would argue that stabbing
[03:56:47.120 --> 03:56:54.040]  a bunch of people for not believing the same thing of you is the very definition of hatred
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:57:01.080]  and really that's what we should be worried about FBI says San Bernardino terrorists were
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:03.200]  triggered by Christmas meeting.
[03:57:03.200 --> 03:57:06.800]  Now we heard reports about this at the time of the San Bernardino attack last year now
[03:57:06.800 --> 03:57:14.400]  it's been confirmed again the attackers Tashfin Malik was ordered along with Farooq to attend
[03:57:14.400 --> 03:57:19.560]  a Christmas meeting wasn't even a Christmas party just a Christmas meeting of fellow
[03:57:19.560 --> 03:57:26.000]  county employees in front of a Christmas tree in a conference room and that is what triggered
[03:57:26.000 --> 03:57:29.400]  them to plan this massacre.
[03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:33.960]  I guess the solution to that if you ask the students there at Ohio State University would
[03:57:33.960 --> 03:57:41.000]  be just to ban Christmas right well that's happening at other universities campus reform
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:45.840]  reports no religious icons during Christmas colleges tell students they're basically
[03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:51.600]  saying you can't have nativity scenes you can't have anything related to Christianity no crosses
[03:57:51.600 --> 03:57:58.200]  no Bibles no Jesus you can have bells you can have winter scenes again because God forbid
[03:57:58.200 --> 03:58:06.200]  somebody might get offended so again every year the left proclaims the war on Christmas
[03:58:06.200 --> 03:58:12.480]  to be a ludicrous conspiracy theory while declaring war on Christmas and it's funny
[03:58:12.480 --> 03:58:18.240]  if you go and ask Muslims about this whether they care in every instance I've seen none
[03:58:18.240 --> 03:58:25.160]  of them even care who's offended here again it's white lefty liberals being offended on
[03:58:25.160 --> 03:58:30.440]  behalf of other people the bigger tree of low expectations but that's going to wrap
[03:58:30.440 --> 03:58:34.480]  it up for the show breaking news at info wars dot com Alex will be back with the Sunday
[03:58:34.480 --> 03:58:55.000]  show that's going to do it for now thanks for joining us.
