[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.000 --> 00:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the 11th day. The 11th day of March, 2013. I am your host,
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  Alex Jones, here back in the saddle. Got back on Saturday, did the Sunday broadcast, 4 to
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  6. And here we are live. Max Keiser has made his prediction that you'll see the bond market
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  blow up by the end of April. And he has been saying the last week, as I'm reading his tweets,
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  when he retweets over to the real Alex Jones, that he's seen movement in different areas
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  of the market that show that indeed his prediction is going to come true. I hope he's wrong.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  Even though I don't like this system, any collapse will be used to give the system even
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  more power because we haven't done our job yet of really getting the people aware of
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  who is behind problem reaction solution. I'm also, because he's been promoting this, one
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  of the first people I heard talk about this a couple years ago, Bitcoin. And I know a
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  little bit about it, but not enough to really be able to definitively say what I think about
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  it. I think alternative currencies are great. I think the idea is wonderful, but the way
[01:44.000 --> 01:52.000]  it's being promoted feverishly everywhere, and no one knows who really created it, could
[01:52.000 --> 02:00.000]  they destroy it down the road and sucker a bunch of people as a way to demonize private
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  digital fiat currencies.
[02:02.000 --> 02:09.000]  And I think it's important to say that because when I see the wild eyed almost foaming at
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  the mouth when I was downtown for South by Southwest demonstrating against South by Southwest
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  reportedly trying to get police and code enforcers and then even private goons to not let them
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.000]  to not let us, our street team hand out free Infowars magazines to the media intelligentsia
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  and the wannabes that are down there trying to be given entrance into it.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  I thought that we would send the crew down there and do that. It was actually Max Cabrera's
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  idea, head of planetinfowars.com over there with Christie and the rest of the great crew.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  And I was just shocked by the fact that they tried to do that. But that's a side issue.
[02:50.000 --> 02:59.000]  I had people coming over to me asking about Bitcoin over and over again, and then I just
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  see it all over the place. So it's definitely hitting a cresting point. In fact, guys, will
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  you print me some of the basic data on Bitcoin?
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  I've read it before, but I meant to do it last night and this morning. I didn't have
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  time. I just wanted someone Kaiser comes on. I can ask him about that. That's not the main
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  reason he's coming on. He's all about the collapse. It's ongoing, but he says it's going
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  to accelerate into a new plateau down below the heights we've seen kind of down in the
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  valley. And so we'll get his take on that and a lot of other geopolitical issues, what's
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  happening with the euro and a lot more.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  I want to get Webster Tarpley on this week to give us his take on what's happening in
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  places like Italy against the euro, where he sees that going. And we have some other
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  special guests lined up throughout the week that aren't 100 percent nailed down. So I
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  won't mention I won't mention that yet, but that is just some of what's coming up today.
[03:53.000 --> 04:01.000]  I do want to open the phones up in the second hour. At the bottom of the hour, after I cover
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  a wide range of news, I mean, I've been gone for a week and we can do a document cam for
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  prison planet TV viewers. This is probably the most stacks of news I've had in months.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  There's probably 400 news articles here in front of me. Every one of them I've scanned
[04:17.000 --> 04:24.000]  or read, every one of them I want to cover on air. The problem is each one is a rabbit
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  trail off into other connected dots and information, but I've just somehow got to try to get into
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  all this.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  So we're going to try to break all that down on the other side of this quick break. I am
[04:37.000 --> 04:44.000]  your host, Alex Jones. The news websites are Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and, of course,

[08:02.000 --> 08:08.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Monday, the 11th day of March 2013. Max Keiser
[08:18.000 --> 08:23.000]  on the global financial meltdown that has been going on for the last four or five years
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  incrementally that he believes is about to accelerate massively into a serious implosion
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  level event by late April. He now is doubling down saying he sees the signs confirming his
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  prediction of about six months ago, seven months ago. He'll be joining us on that front
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  and Bitcoin. What is it? Who's behind it? I know he's been a proponent of it, at least
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  in the past. I want to get his take on Bitcoin today because people keep clamoring for me
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  to cover Bitcoin more. I've done a lot of research on it. And I, again, I reserve judgment
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  because there's not a lot known about it. Who created it? It's very shadowy. People
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  say that's the good part. Well, yeah, it's good if you're anonymous. But then when something's
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  been created and then you don't know about its roots, a little bit of an issue. I like
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  to watch things for a while until I jump in bed with it, not criticizing it, just saying
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  there have been a lot of other financial things like this throughout history that when they
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  have the same wild eyed, wide eyed excitement to them.
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  You better you better hold on to your rear end and protect yourself. That's all I can
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  say. OK, wow. Let me just try to do this. You know, I've tried this a million times,
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  failed every time. Let's be serious. I've tried a thousand plus times and failed every
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  time. I'm going to try to just read to you headlines, just maybe just 50 of them or so
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  said of the 300 plus I've got here, because that's I've been really psychoanalyzing myself.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  At night, in the morning, when I get to work, I'll just pour over hundreds of articles and
[09:59.000 --> 10:09.000]  almost get into a. Fractured mindset. Where I've got so many things in my mind, it's hard
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  to focus in on one big subject and really cover that topic in detail, and that's a good
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  thing at certain levels because it shows how things are interconnected.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  But then when you don't get to even 10 percent of what you want to cover, it's a real frustration.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  I can't argue with success. The broadcast is very successful, but I'm trying to make
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  it even more effective against the globalist. Success of the radio show is not the only
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  goal here. Success getting the word out for liberty and resisting tyranny is the goal.
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  A successful radio show is the byproduct and just is like a team of horses. It's a horse
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  that runs right beside the main horse, the lead horse. Now, that said, I want you just
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  to remember as a listener. That this is not a spectator sport and that you are the solution,
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  you are the answer, you are the resistance.
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  When they tell you you've got to be in a free speech zone to protest, you need to let them
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  arrest you and file suit. That's why it's been rolled back all over the country, free
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  speech zones. When they tell you they're not going to organically label food, boycott the
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  stores that won't do it until they capitulate, which is now happening with Whole Foods.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  When Mayor Bloomberg says he's going to tell you how many hours to work a day, what to
[11:21.000 --> 11:28.000]  eat, how much to sleep, what to do in your own home, it's time to say no to him, like
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  Starbucks. I'm saying Starbucks is perfect, certainly not, not a big fan of global chains.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  But Starbucks is saying we're going to continue to serve over 16 ounce drinks. We'll do what
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.000]  we want, thank you very much. Because under Agenda 21, the UN bragged back 20 years ago
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  in 1992, you can go read it.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  They said we're going to start with cigarettes worldwide and ban them. As a model for a
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  world government. But world government by stealth, through local governments, through
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  states, through national governments. Then we're going to move to low flush toilets,
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.000]  then to light bulbs. And once we get people to accept things that sound reasonable, it's
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  going to be no plastic bags, then it's going to be no bags period.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Then it's going to be no plastic in your house, then it's going to be home inspections, then
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  it's going to be carbon taxes on beef, on anything that has a carbon footprint, flatulence
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  taxes. And it's all going in Europe, Australia, Canada, and now here. And shutting our economy
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  down when China, India, Mexico, and 160 plus third world countries are exempt.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  If they're exempt from draconian laws, then it will make the jobs move there immediately.
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.000]  And guess who owns the major industrial combines in those countries, you guessed it, the mega
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  banks. Who have bought control of the planet, or almost have bought control, they're not
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  in full control yet. If they get control, Katie bar the door, okay, they're not in full
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  control yet.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  It'll get about, let me be conservative, ten times worse if they were in full control.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  They're in about 70%, 75% control right now. And let me tell you, they're breathing down
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  our neck, that's why I get so angry. I mean, I know where this is going. Where was I going
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  with all this, though, overall? I was just getting into the whole agenda 21 police state
[13:17.000 --> 13:21.000]  takeover. You've got to say no to it because it's so incredibly hellish.
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  Okay, it's great to be officially back. I mean, I was back yesterday for the Sunday
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  show, but here we are on the big weekday show. Let me just try to go over the stacks. How's
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  that sound? Let me just start, because I'm trying to figure out what the top story is
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  to me. I don't just go with whatever the national news top story is, I go with what I believe
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  the top story is.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  Of course, you can tell me what you think is most important. A lot of times callers
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  call in or we get emails or see comments saying, hey, why didn't you cover this? And that becomes
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.000]  our top story because I agree with you, I think it's important. Homeless Houston veterans
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  cited for dumpster diving in search for food, that's News 92 FM, they have a copy of the
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  ticket. And they've banned feeding the homeless in Houston, so they just say, what do they
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  do, die?
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  And what a sign of an amazing tyranny when cops will give a homeless person period. But
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  I'm telling you, so many of the homeless I see now are not drunks, they're not drug addicts,
[14:25.000 --> 14:32.000]  they're not hobos. I'll ask them, I'll say, I mean, a lot of times these guys, you can
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  call them the real deal. And I'll say, what's your story? And I know what they're gonna
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  say, I was special forces for 10 years, I was in the first Gulf War, I got hit with
[14:43.000 --> 14:49.000]  nerve gas during the nerve gas alert and I got brain damage now and I can't get a job.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  And you could tell they're all there, but they are damaged. And the guy rides off on
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  their bike.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.840]  Now I see the homeless and they are injured vets. I've seen homeless vets with arms and
[15:01.840 --> 15:08.480]  legs blown off. And I just can't imagine being a cop and coming over to a dumpster and there's
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.960]  a guy and they're eating and you're gonna give him a ticket. I mean, man, boy, let me
[15:13.960 --> 15:19.120]  tell you, just thinking about that, I can literally pick up on God's anger.
[15:19.120 --> 15:27.960]  I mean, just inside it makes me shake, shake to think to be one of those people. It makes
[15:27.960 --> 15:37.880]  me shake. It makes me shake. And again, this isn't even about I'm a guy on a high horse,
[15:37.880 --> 15:44.460]  I'm a good guy. It makes me feel bad to even imagine that and that's nothing on the scale
[15:44.460 --> 15:45.460]  of evil.
[15:45.460 --> 15:51.680]  It's just imagine that, okay, that's one of the articles. They're all up at info.wars.com
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.520]  or most of them are. Former Newark Airport TSA screener says the job does little to keep
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.120]  fliers safe. Really, they're trying to be a slave. TSA allowed people with criminal
[16:01.120 --> 16:08.720]  records to get airport security badges, New American Magazine, Michael Tenet, or is that
[16:08.720 --> 16:09.720]  Michelle Tenet?
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.760]  I'm reading from a distance. And the article breaks down all the admitted cases where they
[16:12.760 --> 16:19.360]  hired felons, rapists, robbers. And the thing is they're not letting them slip through.
[16:19.360 --> 16:26.340]  It's not an accident. They do it on purpose. Again, if you're really worried about real
[16:26.340 --> 16:30.840]  terrorists that are gonna attack, why do they then let basically anybody work at an airport?
[16:30.840 --> 16:32.320]  Because that's who they want.
[16:32.320 --> 16:38.040]  In the ads they say, we want you to be imperious and dominating. Remember that ad out of Seattle
[16:38.040 --> 16:47.720]  put out by the TSA? Dominating, imperious. Imperious means arrogantly imperial. That's
[16:47.720 --> 16:56.040]  what's going on. There's another article, second drone spotted over New York speaking
[16:56.040 --> 17:01.200]  in New York. UAV reported within three miles of LaGuardia Airport.
[17:01.200 --> 17:04.740]  They've already had them crash. They've already had them almost run into airplanes over Denver.
[17:04.740 --> 17:10.240]  That's top drugs, link left hand side, drugsreport.com right now. So we've now covered three articles
[17:10.240 --> 17:17.240]  now. Let's continue to try to get into more. This one, I'm gonna cover this now at about
[17:17.240 --> 17:20.480]  40 after, so as I'm getting behind.
[17:20.480 --> 17:25.200]  I mentioned this yesterday just as a side issue and realized how wild it sounded. Because
[17:25.200 --> 17:35.800]  2013 is wild. 1950 was wild too, I'm gonna tell you in a minute. Immortal cell line.
[17:35.800 --> 17:40.480]  And guess what's immortal? These are cells that do not die. They just sit there in a
[17:40.480 --> 17:47.000]  Petri dish replicating forever. And there's only one kind of cell, and it's very rare
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.340]  in cancer. It's cancer cells.
[17:51.340 --> 17:58.200]  And when I talk about this, people will say, you got this from the latest installment of
[17:58.200 --> 18:07.080]  the movie I am Legend, which was then turned into the film The Last Man on Earth with Vincent
[18:07.080 --> 18:13.800]  Price, which is an excellent classic high art in my opinion. You're gonna think that
[18:13.800 --> 18:16.600]  the movie that came out a few years ago, I am Legend.
[18:16.600 --> 18:27.440]  You're gonna think, wait, you got this from I am Legend. No, I didn't. No, I didn't. 20
[18:27.440 --> 18:31.800]  years ago, they put out more than 20 years ago, they put out white papers that are public
[18:31.800 --> 18:39.480]  and I'm gonna go over some of them. Where they knew that the key to immortality in their
[18:39.480 --> 18:41.960]  belief, this is the establishment.
[18:41.960 --> 18:48.280]  If you control trillions, you're worth billions. You've had every sex you can imagine. You've
[18:48.280 --> 18:52.640]  got everything. You own mountaintops, jet copters. What do you want? What's the one
[18:52.640 --> 18:59.640]  thing you want? More life. What does Roy Batty tell the head of the Tyrell Corporation? I
[18:59.640 --> 19:03.720]  want more life, and then adds an expletive.
[19:03.720 --> 19:15.160]  Ah, the facts of life. What has been already made and cannot be unmade? Well, not if you're
[19:15.160 --> 19:23.880]  undead. But it's not even undead, you will be a living cancer. And I talked about this
[19:23.880 --> 19:28.040]  more than a decade ago, and then I went with some friends a while back and saw the latest
[19:28.040 --> 19:33.680]  Resident Evil, cuz I'd read about the plot. And it's a super cancer virus that makes you
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.960]  basically immortal, unless you can get burned up.
[19:38.960 --> 19:42.600]  And then I realized, I went back and did some research, cuz I remembered this, that this
[19:42.600 --> 19:51.000]  was all in the literature from the 50s. Now codified by the early 90s, where they're gonna,
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.800]  well, just wait till I get to this. Okay, just wait till I cover this. It's coming up
[19:56.800 --> 19:59.560]  at about 40 after, we'll be right back.
[19:59.560 --> 20:05.880]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have. It's Cells Alive Silver
[20:05.880 --> 20:11.560]  Solution, and it destroys over 650 hard to kill viruses, fungus, bacteria, and much more.

[20:29.840 --> 20:34.040]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[20:34.040 --> 20:38.280]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[20:38.280 --> 20:42.400]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[20:42.400 --> 20:45.800]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[20:45.800 --> 20:49.160]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our

[23:54.760 --> 24:12.960]  MyPatriotsSupply.com. In 1814 we took a little trip. In 1814 we took a little trip along
[24:12.960 --> 24:17.480]  with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi. We took a little bacon and we took a little
[24:17.480 --> 24:22.160]  beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans. We fired our guns and
[24:22.160 --> 24:27.000]  the British kept on coming. There wasn't as many as there was a while ago. We fired once
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.280]  more and they began to run it. On down to Mississippi to the gun. But nowadays people
[24:31.280 --> 24:36.440]  think you can't stand up for anything. We looked down a river and we see the British
[24:36.440 --> 24:42.400]  coming. The establishment tells you you're going to lose. Resistance is futile. You must
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.080]  give in to us. We're going to open the borders. We're going to take your kids. We're going
[24:47.080 --> 24:51.040]  to socialize things. We're going to force inoculations on you. We're going to make you
[24:51.040 --> 24:57.720]  eat GMO. We're going to geo-engineer the skies. We're going to get rid of your national sovereignty.

[25:01.260 --> 25:06.920]  of toilet and light bulbs you can have. We're going to tell you 60% taxes isn't enough.
[25:06.920 --> 25:10.800]  We're going to make the public dependent. No, you're not. We're going to ban your free
[25:10.800 --> 25:18.480]  speech. No, you're not. You've got to find the fight in you, ladies and gentlemen. And
[25:18.480 --> 25:22.120]  what's incredible is most of the time when you stand up, you have victory. In fact, at
[25:22.120 --> 25:26.640]  the bottom of the next hour, David Knight and Sha'Carri Jackson shot a piece at the
[25:26.640 --> 25:31.360]  Alamo reenactment and then they were banning our free speech in Austin or trying to order
[25:31.360 --> 25:32.520]  the police to do it.
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.240]  We learned there was a police revolt. I didn't hear this from the police. I learned it from
[25:37.240 --> 25:40.520]  CB. I learned all the cops were smiling at me when I showed up to demonstrate against
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.680]  the South by Southwest. And then I later talked to CBS and they had all the big sheets from
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.480]  the interview. I don't think it even aired though, where they talked to the cops and
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.220]  the cops said, well, we made the determination that the ordinance does not say that they
[25:52.220 --> 25:53.720]  can't hand stuff out.
[25:53.720 --> 25:59.560]  Now, the big fracas though, because they had the city of Austin come down with code enforcement
[25:59.560 --> 26:02.880]  and try to order the police to give people tickets. They did give warnings and then say,
[26:02.880 --> 26:06.460]  you know, we're not even doing that. Now, by the time I got back to Austin, I drove
[26:06.460 --> 26:10.320]  back a day early because of this. I didn't know all this and I showed up, about 100 people
[26:10.320 --> 26:16.480]  showed up real quick just off an internet announcement for an impromptu flash demonstration.
[26:16.480 --> 26:19.360]  And News 8 Austin was out there. A bunch of others were out there. It may have aired.
[26:19.360 --> 26:22.240]  I don't really watch television, so I don't know. I haven't looked it up, but I haven't
[26:22.240 --> 26:23.240]  heard about it.
[26:23.240 --> 26:27.720]  So maybe, did News 8 Austin or CBS cover it? Let's check that. Now, we can talk about it
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.840]  on South by Southwest and it'll pop up. But I mean, when my crew called me and said, I'm
[26:33.840 --> 26:38.040]  gonna cover this and show video for TV viewers, audio for radio listeners in about an hour,
[26:38.040 --> 26:42.080]  about an hour and five minutes exactly, middle of the second hour.
[26:42.080 --> 26:45.960]  They said, the code enforcement's here saying you can't have bumper stickers on your car.
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.760]  And I said, let me talk to them next time they come up with the cops. Code enforcement
[26:49.760 --> 26:54.120]  backed up by police. And I got on the phone with the guy and he's like, my superiors say
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.160]  you can't have this car parked in this parking meter with stickers on it.
[26:58.160 --> 27:02.700]  And I said, you gotta be kidding me. This is a joke, right? And he's like, nope, that's
[27:02.700 --> 27:06.900]  what they're saying. So we called their bluff, they had to back off. And it's this whole
[27:06.900 --> 27:10.400]  thing of their being ordered. The guy on the phone said he knew it was wrong.
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.360]  The police said they knew it was wrong. And then they finally just said no. What's so
[27:14.360 --> 27:21.460]  wrong about saying no to unlawful orders? I mean, I just do not get it. And it's time
[27:21.460 --> 27:30.400]  for the citizens to say no. No, no, no, N-O, no, no, no, no, no, no. You need to learn
[27:30.400 --> 27:31.400]  that word.
[27:31.400 --> 27:37.200]  Three year olds know it. We need to learn it. No, no, because everybody thinks if you
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.720]  just bend over to the government, lie down to the system, start licking their boots,
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.240]  they're gonna be nice to you. They're gonna put people in who want to have their boots
[27:44.240 --> 27:45.240]  licked.
[27:45.240 --> 27:48.560]  Most people in government now still don't wanna have their boots licked low level. High
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.880]  level they do. So they're telling the enforcers to go out and turn us into slaves. And they're
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.800]  trying to create flowerly threats and scary reasons we should do this. In fact, I got
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.020]  to this some yesterday, there's more out on it today.
[28:04.020 --> 28:07.600]  I'm gonna be covering this after we get to more headlines in the next segment. Boy, big
[28:07.600 --> 28:17.600]  news on the economy, but Max Keiser's coming up on that. 46,609,000 people on food stamps
[28:17.600 --> 28:27.040]  and now has just gone up in the last couple months to 47,791,996. There's a lot of other
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.520]  supplementals. If you add in all the forms of county and city supplementals and things,
[28:31.520 --> 28:34.920]  it's more like 80 million are on some form of food assistance.
[28:34.920 --> 28:41.000]  Unbelievable. Out of 315 mil, 80 something mil have to have the government feed them.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.880]  And God forbid though, churches try to do it, that's banned all over the country. From
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.720]  Houston to Florida cities, you see that in the niche. And God forbid a veteran climb
[28:49.720 --> 28:57.600]  in a dumpster. May I tell you, in Europe right now, in Spain and in other areas, people are
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.120]  dumpster diving families.
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.840]  Cuz the rich are throwing stuff out. A pair has got a rot hole in it, the rich people
[29:03.840 --> 29:10.760]  throw that away. They don't know how to just slice off the rotten part. And over here though,
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.160]  they give you tickets or arrest your butt. It was picked up by KI, pamphlet ordinance
[29:16.160 --> 29:26.560]  not enforced by Southwest. And so they did cover it. Strangely enough, we're not even
[29:26.560 --> 29:28.360]  in this report.
[29:28.360 --> 29:35.280]  Okay, wait a minute, it's a side issue for national listeners. It just shows how crazy
[29:35.280 --> 29:39.480]  government's gotten. So they did cover it. But they went to the cops, the cops said we're
[29:39.480 --> 29:44.760]  not enforcing that. Well, you'd already given out tickets. And I gave KI a copy of the warning
[29:44.760 --> 29:49.880]  ticket. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. Stand up or be a slave.
[29:49.880 --> 30:00.880]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[33:37.160 --> 33:43.840]  Time. We are here live back weeknight, 7 o'clock within Fall Wars Nightly News. You can get
[33:43.840 --> 33:48.960]  11 memberships for $5.95 a month. One master membership create a username passcode. You
[33:48.960 --> 33:54.280]  can share 11 people can simultaneously watch the nightly news. All that does is pay for
[33:54.280 --> 33:58.180]  the bandwidth. That's my goal. We would be 100% on our own platform, but we cannot pay
[33:58.180 --> 34:04.520]  for the bandwidth of hundreds of millions of views just on YouTube conservatively every
[34:04.520 --> 34:05.520]  year.
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.960]  OK, so it's members of prison planet TV that help pay for the cameras, the infrastructure,
[34:10.960 --> 34:16.120]  the bandwidth, the reporters, the research to then be able to produce the information
[34:16.120 --> 34:23.640]  to air select news reports that we produce here on the radio slash TV and to transmit
[34:23.640 --> 34:30.080]  it all to you, the members of prison planet dot TV or info wars news dot com. Now, 10
[34:30.080 --> 34:36.080]  years up and running. And it's all up there. The incredible special reports, the live coverage,
[34:36.080 --> 34:40.840]  the special events, the on the road live coverage, all of it.
[34:40.840 --> 34:48.600]  The rant section, the analysis section. It's all there. The ebooks, prison planet dot TV.
[34:48.600 --> 34:51.920]  Again, that's prison planet dot TV, and I want to thank all of you that are members.
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.160]  If you're not a member, now is the time. It's less than fifty five cents a month per person
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.040]  under the 11 memberships. It says 10 in the ad, but your membership and 10 more and that's
[35:01.040 --> 35:02.720]  simultaneous viewers.
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.880]  Chances are most people you give it to are going to watch it every day. We wish they
[35:05.880 --> 35:11.020]  would wake up. So you probably give it to 20 people. Hey, this isn't even passcode.
[35:11.020 --> 35:16.000]  Just make a new one that's only for the site. Obviously, it shouldn't be to your bank account.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.540]  So a prison planet dot TV. You know, we might try to set it up where it randomly generates
[35:20.540 --> 35:21.540]  some other codes, too.
[35:21.540 --> 35:28.640]  But side issue, the establishment does not want you to hear and see this information.
[35:28.640 --> 35:32.840]  The establishment does not want you to know what's going on. The establishment has done
[35:32.840 --> 35:38.080]  everything they can to try to discredit what we're saying, what we're talking about, what
[35:38.080 --> 35:39.320]  we're covering here.
[35:39.320 --> 35:48.040]  In fact, one area in my stack of news, stack after stack after stack, is Forbes. And I'll
[35:48.040 --> 35:54.080]  cover that in the next hour saying 1.6 billion bullets, that's today. We need to have a national
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.200]  discussion about this and the armored vehicles and everything. Wait a minute, Forbes, you
[35:58.200 --> 36:00.240]  didn't get the memo?
[36:00.240 --> 36:07.480]  It's over 2 billion now in the last 15, 16 months. And it's all public. It's federal
[36:07.480 --> 36:18.360]  purchase orders at FedBiz.gov. But you didn't hear CNN, MSNBC, Politico, and Media Matters,
[36:18.360 --> 36:22.560]  the White House Public Operations Office, with all the White House people running it.
[36:22.560 --> 36:27.880]  You didn't hear them say it doesn't exist and that it's racist? You're like, what does
[36:27.880 --> 36:33.320]  that have to do with race? It's racist, okay? It's racist. It's racist. And never mind the
[36:33.320 --> 36:34.320]  giant arms build up.
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.840]  And you heard Gibbs, there's no drone program either. Even though it publicly exists, it
[36:37.840 --> 36:43.120]  doesn't exist. So they got a big problem. And this is what I did a video about last
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.920]  week when I was taken off of the family and what I called in about. There is a major tipping
[36:48.920 --> 36:52.640]  point. There's the headline, 1.6 billion rounds of ammo for Homeland Security. It's time for
[36:52.640 --> 37:00.880]  a national conversation. Do me a favor and print me that article. I know I have it in
[37:00.880 --> 37:02.380]  the stack, but I can't find it for some reason.
[37:02.380 --> 37:05.320]  That's another problem with having so many news articles. I have like five stacks of
[37:05.320 --> 37:14.040]  gun news here. Yeah, more than five stacks. And last week when I got on, I was so excited
[37:14.040 --> 37:20.560]  I was ranting and raving about the fact that we're in the fight and the fact that we're
[37:20.560 --> 37:26.240]  having an effect and the White House is responding every day to what info wars.com is doing.
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.960]  They're responding every day to what drugs report.com is doing. And I'm just giving credit
[37:30.960 --> 37:31.960]  where it's due.
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.560]  And then Infowars is forcing all the big neocon host who wouldn't cover this are now covering
[37:38.560 --> 37:44.260]  it. We're taking over the discussion with the truth. Hey, why'd they buy 2,700 giant
[37:44.260 --> 37:53.800]  black wheeled tanks that say US National Police FEMA on them that we photographed in Austin?
[37:53.800 --> 37:57.600]  Why are they running checkpoints? Why are they announcing brigade homeland 300 plus
[37:57.600 --> 38:02.460]  thousand federal troops to be deployed? That's Army Times. And they're like, that's not happening.
[38:02.460 --> 38:03.880]  Let's not have a national discussion.
[38:03.880 --> 38:09.640]  They are writing hit pieces every day. The AP's written articles trying to whitewash
[38:09.640 --> 38:14.080]  it that are in hundreds, less conservative, thousands of newspapers and TV stations pick
[38:14.080 --> 38:19.820]  up on AP. You can't even count them all. And they're saying it doesn't exist. It doesn't
[38:19.820 --> 38:27.280]  exist or AP won't be as obvious as Politico or Slate or Media Matters saying it doesn't
[38:27.280 --> 38:28.280]  exist.
[38:28.280 --> 38:34.580]  It's a fake online rumor from an anonymous post. That's what they say. AP won't fully
[38:34.580 --> 38:39.300]  destroy themselves. They say, well, Jones is really wrong. He's kind of right about
[38:39.300 --> 38:47.100]  1.6 billion, but 200,000 for this department's no big deal. And then other outfits are like,
[38:47.100 --> 38:50.840]  it's not 1.6 billion, it's a million bullets were bought by this outfit.
[38:50.840 --> 38:56.000]  So they'll take one line item and focus in on that. Ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.000]  have them running around like chickens with their heads cut off, doing the dangerous tactic
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.840]  of saying none of this exists if it wasn't really dangerous for them. How do you know
[39:08.840 --> 39:10.000]  the enemy's weak spot?
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.040]  It's when they send their full force to that area. How do you know where, in the old days,
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.280]  they would have siege engines, even primitive explosives, Chinese had it thousands of years
[39:21.280 --> 39:26.120]  ago, trying to blow up castle defenses. And they'd have armies attacking from all sides.
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.660]  They didn't have radios. You couldn't see the flags over the other side of the castle.
[39:30.660 --> 39:34.940]  They'd use those to communicate up on hilltops. How would you know when there was a breach?
[39:34.940 --> 39:38.760]  When you saw everybody defending this area of the castle, turn and start running down
[39:38.760 --> 39:43.540]  towards the other end of the castle. You would say, breach, you understand they're not going
[39:43.540 --> 39:47.740]  to tell us when we're hurting them badly, except by their actions.
[39:47.740 --> 39:53.400]  And when they're going, there are no bullet purchases. There are no armored vehicles.
[39:53.400 --> 39:57.960]  There are no checkpoints. There are no military drills. There are no black helicopters. You're
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.360]  like, well, there was a big black helicopter drill in my town. They practice taking over
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.400]  the capital. Yeah, they practice stopping your local government. They're practicing
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.880]  a civil war federal takeover, which is a global takeover.
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.500]  And they don't wanna have a national debate about this before they nuke a major city and
[40:14.500 --> 40:18.580]  blame it on the Patriots. They wanna nuke the city or release a bio weapon or blow up
[40:18.580 --> 40:23.920]  a federal building. I hope it's something small, hope it's nothing, and then blame us.
[40:23.920 --> 40:33.660]  And so this is so paramount, this is so off the chart, this is so important, that mainstream
[40:33.660 --> 40:38.000]  media, not all of them are bad. And those that still want credibility, and those that
[40:38.000 --> 40:43.160]  also want subscribers and readers, cuz telling the truth also is successful.
[40:43.160 --> 40:47.920]  People are running from lies quickly. So you're basically killing yourselves, the mercenaries
[40:47.920 --> 40:55.600]  at CNN, the mercenaries at MSNBC, the mercenaries at Politico, the mercenaries at Media Matters,
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.180]  who's publicly run by the former White House transition chief and about what, 30 something
[41:00.180 --> 41:01.720]  other top Obama people.
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.640]  I mean, it is the White House. And who are they attacking every week? Alex Jones, Matt
[41:06.640 --> 41:13.680]  Drudge, the list goes on and on. I mean, their memo came out in Politico two years ago, and
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.900]  Politico spun it and said, it's no big deal. Yeah, they call for infiltrating and sabotaging
[41:17.900 --> 41:20.000]  media companies from within.
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.680]  I mean, that's racketeering, folks, that's spy operations. It came out in the Daily Mail
[41:26.680 --> 41:32.520]  about the military's practicing infiltrating local governments and buying them off. They're
[41:32.520 --> 41:39.880]  not practicing that. I told you about that 14 years ago in Police State 2000 with video
[41:39.880 --> 41:45.320]  with emergency managers and police chiefs of major cities in Texas on video with me
[41:45.320 --> 41:47.400]  saying Special Forces tried to buy them off.
[41:47.400 --> 41:53.440]  This is a long term program, not in drills. The cover is the drill, just like with terror
[41:53.440 --> 41:59.680]  attacks. And again, it's not our military, it's criminal groups in control through the
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.240]  Special Forces level that's even above the generals. You always hear, yeah, Navy SEALs
[42:04.240 --> 42:08.440]  and Delta Force, even Green Berets are above the generals.
[42:08.440 --> 42:14.080]  Well, yeah, cuz they now work for criminal offshore conduits that have been taken outside
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.960]  of the command structure cuz they just fired what, 11 generals the last three or four months?
[42:18.960 --> 42:23.000]  The head of CENTCOM, you name it, cuz they wanted to give help to the ambassador for
[42:23.000 --> 42:28.040]  eight hours while Al-Qaeda hired by Obama was killing everybody.
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.240]  It was the local Benghazi security force. Anyways, I'm already digressing. The point
[42:32.240 --> 42:37.920]  is, is that if we have a discussion about this and it's starting to come out in Forbes
[42:37.920 --> 42:43.040]  and Daily Mail and newspapers everywhere. I mean, the system is saying there are no
[42:43.040 --> 42:47.120]  army drills, there are no black helicopters, there are no federal checkpoints, there are
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.200]  no TSA checkpoints, there are no billion six, now two billion bullets.
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.800]  There are no 2,700 strikers, armored vehicles. There are no, there are no, there are no,
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.460]  there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no, there are no.
[43:01.460 --> 43:06.400]  That is basically self-immolation. They have set themselves on fire to light the way for
[43:06.400 --> 43:12.760]  other liars in just desperate all out hoaxes. This is like 12 hours into the Tet Offensive,
[43:12.760 --> 43:17.280]  there's a full out attack by North Vietnam against the south, overrunning positions,
[43:17.280 --> 43:19.400]  killing people, burning cities everywhere.
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.300]  And the news is saying there is no Tet Offensive, there is no Tet Offensive, there is no Tet
[43:23.300 --> 43:29.240]  Offensive. And the psych warfare chief publicly talk about this. They say it doesn't matter
[43:29.240 --> 43:33.240]  if you know it's a lie. It's just meant to make you not take action and then have a debate
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.400]  about the lie.
[43:37.400 --> 43:40.900]  You see, because it's targeting the general dumbed down public that just goes, well, Alex
[43:40.900 --> 43:43.880]  was saying they were planning this, but we don't know if it's true. Cuz you won't go
[43:43.880 --> 43:49.480]  look it up on the federal purchase order website that we linked to. But what I'm saying is,
[43:49.480 --> 43:53.720]  and Joseph Goebbels wrote about this, and then I read some declassified CIA stuff from
[43:53.720 --> 43:57.480]  the 60s where they said, in third world countries, we can't be over the top.
[43:57.480 --> 44:01.400]  As Joseph Goebbels pointed out, but also Bernays, they talk about him, he was still advising
[44:01.400 --> 44:06.680]  him at that point. The problem is, is that when it's too over the top, you lose everything.
[44:06.680 --> 44:14.120]  So there was an internal fight about how ridiculous to be. And what's taken the floor in the last
[44:14.120 --> 44:18.240]  20 years is what Karl Rove talked about eight years ago in the New York Times. He said,
[44:18.240 --> 44:22.080]  it doesn't matter if we get caught torturing and that we publicly ordered it.
[44:22.080 --> 44:25.960]  We'll just say that we didn't order it, even though we publicly ordered it, because we
[44:25.960 --> 44:30.760]  control reality. And he said this to the Washington Post, New York Times, and others at a cocktail
[44:30.760 --> 44:33.520]  party. They were so scared of him, it took them three years to admit it was him. They
[44:33.520 --> 44:38.200]  all wrote about it though, everybody knew who it was, senior White House advisor.
[44:38.200 --> 44:44.360]  And he said, you'll do what you're ordered, I control reality. And even the arrogant sell
[44:44.360 --> 44:48.640]  out mercenaries didn't like that. They wanna feel important and like they're controlling
[44:48.640 --> 44:53.840]  reality and lying to people. They didn't like him saying, I will tell you what to say and
[44:53.840 --> 44:59.120]  you will repeat it, you understand that?
[44:59.120 --> 45:04.920]  And some of them got in trouble, by the way, because he's like, this is off record. But
[45:04.920 --> 45:09.520]  you can't have it off record when you're bragging at a cocktail party. They said six senior
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.080]  newspaper people are all around him. And he goes, you people are nothing. I'll tell you,
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.200]  the sun didn't come up tomorrow and you'll believe it. Go read the quotes.
[45:19.200 --> 45:22.800]  What did Robert Gibbs say? I said I'd cover the virus news. I'll do that at the bottom
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.160]  of the next hour cuz it's so important. I don't do this on purpose. I'm just coming
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.560]  up and I don't, I got so much here to cover. And I wanna go to your calls first the next
[45:29.560 --> 45:33.200]  hour and then get to that and then get to the Alamo report and a lot of other big stuff
[45:33.200 --> 45:35.600]  ahead of Max Keiser.
[45:35.600 --> 45:41.480]  It's just that this is such a big deal. That's why I start hyperventilating over this. It
[45:41.480 --> 45:46.800]  is such a big deal, not in a personal power trip. It's actually pretty creepy. I don't
[45:46.800 --> 45:50.920]  want him to give me cancer. I don't want him to blow my head off or kill me and throw me
[45:50.920 --> 45:52.280]  in a hotel room with a hooker.
[45:52.280 --> 45:56.760]  I mean, I know who these people are. My best shot's to be as public as I can to put all
[45:56.760 --> 46:00.800]  the info out now so there's no point in killing me and turning me into a martyr. I hope you
[46:00.800 --> 46:06.240]  guys agree with that logic out there listening, the establishment. I'm not looking forward
[46:06.240 --> 46:07.240]  to you killing me.
[46:07.240 --> 46:12.120]  But if that happens, that's the way it is. I'm into this. I'm committed cuz I'm just
[46:12.120 --> 46:17.000]  into the human species. I'm into my children's future and it's just my male instinct to defend
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.220]  the truth is so over driving I can't stop.
[46:20.220 --> 46:26.560]  But side issue, it's really living is what it is. The truth is what matters. I worship
[46:26.560 --> 46:34.960]  the truth because who is the author of truth? God is truth. The devil is lies. And I want
[46:34.960 --> 46:38.200]  the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. I would rather know the horrible truth
[46:38.200 --> 46:46.020]  and make preparation for it, to quote Patrick Henry, than to just be delusional.
[46:46.020 --> 46:49.560]  So understand what's happening now. They've gotten to the point, they're listening right
[46:49.560 --> 46:52.880]  now. They admittedly listen. The White House, their Media Matters listens, records the show
[46:52.880 --> 46:56.820]  every day. They've talked about their national studies they've done on the show where they
[46:56.820 --> 46:57.820]  have three people.
[46:57.820 --> 47:02.580]  You can go read this in their research reports they file, how they come up with it, how many
[47:02.580 --> 47:08.680]  times this website links to us, how many times I say this. They have three full time paid
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.920]  people in DC. They also have a New York office, three people listening right now to take stuff
[47:14.920 --> 47:20.740]  out of context and play clips on their website and tell people it's not true.
[47:20.740 --> 47:25.960]  And they're sitting there, destroying their own future, drinking sodium fluoride, laughing
[47:25.960 --> 47:31.400]  about it, frying their brains with cell phone radiation, eating GMO because they're delusional
[47:31.400 --> 47:36.160]  that they're at the White House, they're little agents. Yeah, how do I get off into the CIA
[47:36.160 --> 47:38.560]  infiltration of local government?
[47:38.560 --> 47:41.860]  Whenever that Media Matters memo came out a few years ago about we're gonna infiltrate
[47:41.860 --> 47:47.840]  alternative media and destroy it from within. I mean, that's criminal. But Politico was
[47:47.840 --> 47:52.440]  like, isn't this cute, isn't this fun, cuz they want the White House access. And a few
[47:52.440 --> 47:56.260]  weeks ago, they said one thing about Obama saying he was the puppet master.
[47:56.260 --> 48:00.160]  And so for a few weeks, they were shut off from information and press conferences. And
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.560]  so they groveled and came out and said there are no bullets. They actually said, Paul Watson
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.520]  wrote about it and linked to their article, there are no bullets. Like the New York Times
[48:09.520 --> 48:15.520]  said four years ago, they said I was in the Chantilly, Virginia Marriott Woods having
[48:15.520 --> 48:21.120]  a full on hallucination, go read it, there was no Bilderberg meeting.
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.640]  We force people to admit there's a Bilderberg group, the media starts to cover it, what's
[48:24.640 --> 48:30.080]  the New York Times do? There is no Bilderberg, Alex Jones is completely insane. And people
[48:30.080 --> 48:35.280]  read the New York Times and feel official. They're laughing at you. They're laughing,
[48:35.280 --> 48:38.360]  there are no drones, there is no Bilderberg, there are no bullets, there are no armored
[48:38.360 --> 48:43.800]  vehicles, the TSA. Remember the TSA three years ago, when we really pushed the big TSA
[48:43.800 --> 48:48.880]  story into the big national spotlight for about three, four months?
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.000]  And every day Drudge was linking the new articles we had. And they were saying we do not grope
[48:53.000 --> 48:57.520]  children, we do not go in pants, we do not take you to a secondary room, we do not grope
[48:57.520 --> 49:00.920]  you, we do not strip search. And then they would get caught doing it and say, okay, we
[49:00.920 --> 49:06.040]  do. We do not save naked images, the scanners don't have radiation, they've been fully tested.
[49:06.040 --> 49:11.360]  Congress has been given the evidence, none of that was true. Lies, lies, lies, lies,
[49:11.360 --> 49:17.600]  lies, lies. Let's come back in with ministry in the next segment if we can. Lies, lies,
[49:17.600 --> 49:22.080]  lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.
[49:22.080 --> 49:30.240]  And the fact is, when they're attacking us, and when they are going after us, and when
[49:30.240 --> 49:35.080]  they are saying we're liars, folks, they're not attacking us. It's a big deal to attack
[49:35.080 --> 49:40.120]  and to give us attention. They're doing it out of total desperation, because if the public
[49:40.120 --> 49:45.520]  finds out they've built over 200 FEMA camps in the civilian inmate labor camp program,
[49:45.520 --> 49:46.520]  army.mil, look it up.
[49:46.520 --> 49:51.240]  I just gave you the name, just type it in, five seconds, you'll have it. Civilian inmate
[49:51.240 --> 49:57.260]  labor camp program, the emergency centers establishment act, the clergy response team,
[49:57.260 --> 50:02.440]  the infra guard teams, read the public manuals training for total takeover. And I'm giving
[50:02.440 --> 50:07.040]  you all the names here, where you can read the whole takeover plan. How do I know what's
[50:07.040 --> 50:08.040]  gonna happen next?
[50:08.040 --> 50:11.920]  It's all blueprinted. It's like if I had the blueprints for a house my neighbor's building,
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.120]  and I'm gonna go, yes, next, honey, they're going to build the second floor balcony, and
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.880]  then they're gonna put in the pool area. She's like, how do you know they're building the
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.480]  balcony today? Well, I have the blueprints, next thing's that.
[50:23.480 --> 50:29.040]  It's a TV guide. How do you know the Super Bowl's coming on tonight? Well, I have a TV
[50:29.040 --> 50:35.560]  guide, it's online, it says it's coming on at 6 o'clock tonight. My gosh, you're so smart.
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.320]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating. So they're telling you, the Super Bowl isn't coming on
[50:40.320 --> 50:41.320]  on the day it's coming on.
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.640]  I mean, it's happening, and they just wanna stall you, stall you, stall you. But they
[50:45.640 --> 50:51.080]  wouldn't be attacking us saying this wasn't true on dozens of issues if it wasn't hurting
[50:51.080 --> 50:56.360]  them. And I wanna go on hurting them, because they're hurting innocent people worldwide
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.240]  and wrecking our once great republic. Stay with us.

[53:34.000 --> 53:38.240]  counterfeit then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[53:38.240 --> 53:42.360]  to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[53:42.360 --> 53:45.800]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[53:45.800 --> 53:49.120]  army. Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our
[53:49.120 --> 53:57.360]  monetary system. Call for your copy, 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[53:57.360 --> 54:03.160]  That's 800-686-2237. Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going
[54:03.160 --> 54:12.640]  to overthrow the United States government. You still think that jet fuel brought down
[54:12.640 --> 54:20.440]  the World Trade Center? Does anybody else see a problem here? If the government has
[54:20.440 --> 54:26.120]  nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions? This story does not
[54:26.120 --> 54:41.720]  have an answer. We're on a mission. I'm on a mission to never forget. Three thousand
[54:41.720 --> 55:10.600]  people that I've never met. Infowars.com, the resistance worldwide. Lies! Lies! Lies!
[55:10.600 --> 55:22.640]  I got a message last time I sang along to this that they had a ministry like that. We
[55:22.640 --> 55:25.320]  need to get him back on. We need to try to do that. I know he was on tour last time,
[55:25.320 --> 55:29.720]  but we tried to get him on. Let's get him back on. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so
[55:29.720 --> 55:34.800]  much for joining us. Plus, he promised to come back on when 2012 would not be the end
[55:34.800 --> 55:40.640]  of the world. And he's a good guy. He also ran down people that have been buying gold.
[55:40.640 --> 55:44.420]  I said, what do you got all those gold teeth for? Anyways, we're going to get him back
[55:44.420 --> 55:50.960]  on the broadcast. Man, I tell you, the truth is so much stranger than fiction. Speaking
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.840]  of, do you still think jet fuel brought down the towers? Look at these stacks of news.
[55:55.840 --> 56:00.400]  Now, I mentioned some of this yesterday. By the way, I haven't even gotten into the real
[56:00.400 --> 56:06.080]  top story yet today, because I'm so used to North Korea threatening things. But I started
[56:06.080 --> 56:13.880]  thinking about it last night and this morning on a metric. This is like, let's not exaggerate,
[56:13.880 --> 56:20.600]  five times the amount of threats and the seriousness of threats I've ever seen. And it's Kim Jong
[56:20.600 --> 56:27.840]  Un who looked more boyish because his dad had kept him at Swiss boarding schools and
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.200]  things until just a few years ago. Who looked all scared and boyish just six months ago,
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.200]  now has that same crazy demonic, I'm in full power.
[56:37.200 --> 56:42.160]  I can order young girls strung up and killed like his dad would do. I mean, his dad did
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.160]  Hellraiser type stuff on record at the Seven Story Pleasure Palace. You can look that up.
[56:48.160 --> 56:53.700]  He would have planes hijacked to kidnap South Korean and Japanese film stars that would
[56:53.700 --> 56:59.960]  disappear into the North Korean capital, the only place with electricity in the country
[56:59.960 --> 57:00.960]  basically.
[57:00.960 --> 57:08.880]  Man, the Dennis Rodman thing, I mean, his evil to get money and then the vampiric spiders
[57:08.880 --> 57:15.040]  so happy to have something they thought was a celebrity to embrace and suck in. It was
[57:15.040 --> 57:21.880]  truly disgusting, truly hard to watch and I think is a window into the mindset of narcissism.
[57:21.880 --> 57:25.720]  And look, I was into celebrity a little bit until I was exposed to a bunch of it and found
[57:25.720 --> 57:31.300]  out it was no big deal. The establishment Hollywood style celebrity, they're real people
[57:31.300 --> 57:37.000]  I think are celebrities in my own mind who are activists and intelligent people, artists,
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.040]  violinists, guitarists, guitar heroes.
[57:39.040 --> 57:44.800]  I mean, it's people I admire, but just the all out worship of it is so disgusting. And
[57:44.800 --> 57:51.120]  North Korea threatens preemptive nuclear strike as US South begin war games. They've ended
[57:51.120 --> 57:58.900]  the 1950s armistice. I mean, that's off the chart. You see, that was a ceasefire in a
[57:58.900 --> 58:08.680]  war that was never ended. So the war that so many of our family members fought in, like
[58:08.680 --> 58:11.760]  my late uncle Leonard, it is now back on.
[58:11.760 --> 58:18.120]  So I'm gonna be breaking that down. And we're gonna take your phone calls at 800-25-99231.
[58:18.120 --> 58:24.600]  First time callers today, 800-25-99231. US South Korea begin military exercises North
[58:24.600 --> 58:32.400]  ends armistice and threatens to preemptively nuke the United States. And thanks to Clinton
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.980]  and Donald Rumsfeld, they both work together. They were given missiles that can deliver
[58:36.980 --> 58:39.840]  the systems under Laura Allen Hughes.

[59:53.600 --> 01:00:05.280]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:12.280]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover ups. You want answers? Well so does
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:22.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.760]  Alright folks, Max Keiser on what he believes is going to be a financial implosion by late
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.640]  April is going to be joining us. He's going to cover Bitcoin a lot more in the next hour.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.080]  I've got a ton of news, special reports this hour, but I promise to take some calls right
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.640]  up front. I'm going to rant because I've got more I want to say a little bit in the next
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.960]  segment about Dennis Rodman because I've been out of town for a week and I haven't really
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.720]  talked about this. The incredibly disgusting spectacle, a little bit in the next segment
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.760]  and tie it into North Korea threatening to nuke the United States. Now the armistice,
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:59.880]  which was a cease fire, has ended. So there's a state of war between the United States and
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.820]  South Korea versus North Korea. I mean, this is a big deal. You've got an insane little
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:11.720]  demon running North Korea. And as bad as the globalist are, and they are bad, this guy's
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.260]  what they wish they were. I mean, these guys can't even get their cars to work. But they've
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.580]  got a big military to threaten people. I mean, what a joke. That's one of the few countries
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:27.120]  that did a total roll in and carpet bombing of the government would really be a nice thing.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:31.160]  I mean, nothing could be as bad. Nothing could be as bad. I mean, I can look in the eyes
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.600]  of their government officials, all crazed and weird sycophantic mental illness and then
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:42.880]  some toddling little third generation dictator moron hugging some burnout nobody. I was actually
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.400]  in Los Angeles one time. I'm not going to even tell the story. It doesn't even matter.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:53.440]  Dennis Rodman is a complete joke. No one even wants to be around him. Bankrupted, that's
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.120]  a bad thing in and of itself. It's just an idiot. And it just shows how disconnected
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:04.320]  North Korea is. Man, I tell you, they say Kim Jong-un is just obsessed with Hollywood
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:09.040]  and that's all he does is read Hollywood magazines and watch TV all day. I mean, what an obscenity.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.480]  I mean, I would just love, love to get in a room with that guy. I mean, I would just
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.480]  love it. Wouldn't you love? Because I'm not somebody that dreams about beating the hell
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.520]  out of people, but I would love. Just let me punch him two or three times. I guarantee
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520]  you.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.480]  I'm not going to fantasize here. Can you imagine an uppercut to that nose, full power? I mean,
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.880]  just give it absolute caveman swing. The nose would completely be off the nose. It'd be
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.560]  a big gaping black hole of blood spraying out. And then right into those teeth, bam.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.480]  And then just slam that head on the ground. Can you imagine that bouncing like a basketball?
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:49.320]  I mean, I'm sorry. I mean, I got to admit, I look at that tyrant and I have fantasies.
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.120]  You know, all the people they string up and torture and all the kids and women because
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.720]  reportedly they're into women. That's what him and his daddy reportedly into torturing
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.280]  them to death. And then it's all cute for Dennis Rodman.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.880]  Look at the other sycophant. Who's that weirdo? I've seen that some comedian or something.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:13.700]  Who's the other guy up there in the middle? Who's that guy? The other black guy above
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:20.320]  the crazy psychopath below him. Who is that guy? I know that guy. I've seen him. I mean,
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:26.200]  just just it's just I've never, this is like hell or something.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.000]  And just look at the smile on Kim Jong Un's face. I mean, let's wipe that off your face,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.360]  you little ferret, you little gerbil. Oh, man, get it off screen. Get it off. I'm going
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.600]  to rant in the next segment. I said I'd take calls this segment. I didn't. I'll just come
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.000]  back and talk about it. I'll go to your calls.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.400]  I have an instinct to want to put bad people down. And I don't do that to sound tough or
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.960]  whatever. I have a problem just being honest how I feel and looking at that punches my
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:04.600]  buttons really, really bad. It punches my buttons really, really bad. And I love the
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.560]  fact Dennis Rodman was thrown out of a bar.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.080]  I mean, that guy. Let me tell you, man, it'd be one thing if he went and was very solemn
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.520]  and it was actually an ambassador. It'd still be a joke and said, what you're doing is wrong
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.040]  and everything. Then I would say, wow, the guy actually did something. Instead, he went
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.820]  and groveled and said he was a great guy and all this when the guys, him and his family
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.960]  have like 10 million people's blood on their hands.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:33.560]  And I've read about the confirmed reports about how the lower half class are put in
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:40.680]  pins as animals and their kids are taken and sent to another camp so there's no family.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:46.480]  And the things they do in the medical experiments and all of it, the dehumanization, I think
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:51.080]  of the millions of and the fact that when you look at their officers, they all have
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.680]  the same demonic look in their eye of just craven death worship. And I just absolutely
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:03.920]  want to annihilate them. Don't you? Now that we have moved into the winter season,
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:09.240]  there is an increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are

[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:30.760]  There's a new article that just went up minutes ago at info-wars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:37.640]  It's titled, The Police Will Protect You, So Turn In Your Guns. And the Veritas Project,
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.060]  folks that brought down Acorn, we're going to get them back on this week, they've gone
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:48.040]  around to police stations all over the country and gone in in pro-tyranny areas, anti-gun
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]  areas.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.680]  And they've actually gone in there and said, should I be able to have a gun? The police
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.120]  openly say no, no one should be allowed to have a gun except the police. You need to
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.600]  get a dog. The same thing that Michael Moore told Luke Rudowski of We Are Change. In fact,
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:11.520]  you probably should tell Kurt in his article to add a link to that particular We Are Change
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.880]  video because this is a meme.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.560]  Get a dog. Somebody in Tinton home invading is gonna kill your dog. And the idea that
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.580]  we don't have a right to protect ourselves and that the police are gonna do it when they
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:32.400]  have no statutory directive to do it. I mean, there are some common law failure to render
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.360]  aid, but the cops have exempted themselves even from that, to where they're saying they
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:40.360]  don't have a compulsion to protect you, but I can't protect myself.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:48.000]  I mean, if I lived in Chicago or New York, you better believe I'd have a gun. I mean,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.400]  I'm a pretty big guy and I've had people try to shake me down on the New York subway just
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.360]  to see if I'd be scared and give them my watch. And I was like, are you really joking, guys?
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.880]  I was there with a couple other people that we actually got in a fight on the New York
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.280]  subway. I let the guy push me cuz I didn't wanna go to jail. It was like three in the
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.000]  morning when we were coming back, big guy.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.120]  And Rob Jacobson's not that big, ran up and pushed the guy really hard and said, come
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.600]  on. I was just like, let's get out of here. But again, I'm starting to have flashbacks
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:23.020]  to stuff in New York. That was like during the RNC in 2004. Time certainly flies late
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:28.280]  at night after being out on the bay doing some video shooting.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.760]  But before I go to your phone calls and the toll free number to join us when the line
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:39.200]  is open, first time callers 800-25-99231. Let me run over some of the headlines here.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.360]  First off, North Korea is constantly threatening to annihilate America and attack South Korea
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:49.420]  and the rest of it. It is the ultimate example of why big government's bad and why state
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.160]  planning destroys things.
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:58.360]  More than 10 million estimated North Koreans have died since the armistice back in the
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:05.360]  1950s, 1953. The war never ended. There was a ceasefire, or to use the European term an
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.560]  armistice. And they have had a ceasefire there with the DMZ. They have abolished the armistice
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.640]  as of yesterday.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:19.120]  They announced they'd do it Friday and said we may preemptively launch an ICBM, which
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.280]  they have, thanks to Laura Allen Hughes and helping them get the reactors. The head of
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.960]  ABB at the time was Donald Rumsfeld and Clinton authorized it. So bipartisan, Rumsfeld's involved
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.880]  in getting Aspartame approved. Rumsfeld is involved in Monsanto and the Terminator gene.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.600]  I mean, it's like he's the devil. There's a poof of white smoke and there's Donald Rumsfeld
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.600]  there.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.080]  But the point is, is that that's why they now have this and have missiles that keep
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.640]  blowing up the launch pad. Let me tell you folks, I've watched how they've blown up.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.920]  They've clearly got space-based and aircraft-based lasers that can shoot from hundreds of miles
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.520]  away and blow those things up. They are blowing them up. And then that's why the White House
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.240]  came out on Saturday and said we can shoot down those missiles.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:09.160]  Yeah, no kidding. I mean, they had 30 years ago DC-10s with giant chemical lasers, the
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:15.960]  entire length of the jet aircraft that are like Star Wars. I mean, particle beam, you're
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:20.560]  going. Shoot right through armor, you name it, very powerful. Regular laser would just
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.280]  bounce off of its particle beam.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.000]  A chemical laser with a cyclotron in it, a small superconducting supercollider, and then
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.960]  it's like a rail gun, but it's small particles and it heats up. The reason I know is, of
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.000]  all people, my dad got a grant in high school to build a primitive particle beam. They were
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.560]  handing out things like that then.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.160]  He was top of his class and he built a small particle laser and was blowing stuff up in
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.480]  the backyard. I can't believe I'm saying this. It sounds so crazy. It's actually true. And
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.800]  he didn't wear the proper safety glasses. He had welding glasses on, wasn't enough.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.920]  Particles went in and his eyes got burned. He was blind for about three weeks, had to
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.780]  wear bandages. They didn't know he'd have his eyesight back. And his eyes went from
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:14.120]  blue to green, but it's really burns. It burned the front of his eye. And he has yellow burns
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.320]  on his eye, but I don't know why I'm telling that story now.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.760]  Okay, anyways, I'm gonna do a special on lasers very soon. Believe me, it's gonna be a viral
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.160]  video. This has been done for months. I've got to finish it up. And when we shot the
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:31.320]  video of the lasers, I'm just gonna leave it at that. I like to have fun. But let me
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.760]  get back to North Korea. Here's Paul Craig Roberts' article dealing with trying to start
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.480]  war in the Middle East with people that aren't starting it and putting Al-Qaeda in Libya
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.440]  and Syria and all these areas.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:50.200]  He's got starting Armageddon in the face, but hiding it with official lies. That's right.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.000]  It's all about doing it publicly, but then openly denying it, just to condition you to
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.200]  accept pure lies and then not even know what's true unless you spend time to actually ferret
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.160]  it out. And then you just try to talk to the cattle out there who think it's cool, who
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.520]  wear their ignorance like an armor they don't wanna know.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:15.080]  And so here it is. North Korea threatens preemptive nuclear strike on US. South begin war games.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:21.320]  South Korea and US begin military drills as North Korea threatens war. That's today, AP.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.040]  North Korea cuts hotline with South, threatens nuclear strike as war games begin. And let
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.720]  me tell you, Kim Jong-un is actually in command.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.600]  And when you look at how mentally ill his generals are, wearing stuff that looks like
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:39.840]  suits from 100 years ago and driving 57 Chevys around and weirdos crying for two days straight
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:46.060]  when Kim Jong-il dies. I mean, this is megalomania. I mean, Hitler turned into Russia who'd never
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:50.680]  been beaten and went and fought numbers of five, six to one when he was already losing
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.680]  in the West.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:58.360]  He got delusional. And the Germans were about 100 times less delusional, historically, and
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.680]  thought they might be able to win and lost millions of soldiers, by the way, and had
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:07.720]  a more high tech military. North Korea's got a bunch of artillery, some old tanks, and
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.520]  a bunch of brainwashed people that'll do whatever they're told.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.800]  But it's over, folks. North Korea actually starts something. And see, most groups like
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.800]  Iran may even be playing a double game with the globalist. We know in Iran-Contra, they
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.800]  made deals with Reagan and others. And Chavez, there was some double gaming going on. But
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.360]  with North Korea, I've analyzed it, China keeps them on a leash, but not a very short
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.520]  one.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.640]  And I mean, they're a real wild card. And it's always been said by analysts that I agree
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:44.980]  with, like Joel Skousen, let's get Joel Skousen on. Let's get Joel Skousen on tomorrow if
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:51.040]  we can, that North Korea will be the trigger for the big one. And what was Lindsey Williams
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.500]  told three years ago, he goes, don't worry about Middle East. They're gonna start a big
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.080]  war, use riots and things to take that down, and that came true.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.880]  He has a Bilderberg level source. I don't even know who it is, can't say the name, obviously.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.040]  But look for North Korea, that's the big one. And right as the global financial collapse
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:13.720]  is about to accelerate, I mean, I'm not saying this is gonna happen, but this is getting
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.820]  close, with them ending the armistice, ending the ceasefire.
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:26.560]  And now I briefly, before I go to your calls, wanna talk about the spectacle of Kim Jong-un,
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:32.040]  the third generation dictator, where there's only power and a few military bases around
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:37.480]  the country and the main city. And they've got high tech CAT scanners and the best equipment
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:43.520]  and Colby beef flown in from Japan, and high priced hookers flown in constantly for them.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:49.000]  And even B movie stars flown in from Japan, South Korea, and the US to service the every
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.520]  whim of Kim Jong-il, and now his son, who showed up whenever he took over the throne.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.020]  That's what it is, it's royalty. That's why royalty is so despicable. A couple more generations,
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.900]  they will be wearing crowns.
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:06.840]  They show up over there. And when he first got in there six, seven months ago, was it
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:12.000]  a year ago his dad died? Time flies. And he was all shell shocked, looked like a little
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.840]  kid who'd been living in Switzerland, who was fascinated with basketball, the NBA, and
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.840]  movies.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:27.920]  He was like this wide eyed, the new Supreme Commander. And now he has that demonic look.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.580]  And I watched the video, you all saw it a week ago, I was out of town, Dennis Rodman
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:37.400]  hugging him and them hugging. And Kim Jong-un's a great guy, and it's so much fun. And the
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:44.920]  sycophanticness of a burnout nobody celebrity getting all this enjoyment and fame off of
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.020]  this infamy.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.340]  And Kim Jong-un hugging him and all the sycophants around them and the gibbering and the evil
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:55.140]  and people playing basketball where if you don't do a good job, you're sent to a death
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:01.120]  camp. And Rodman defending that and saying he's a wonderful person. And all the psychos,
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:07.700]  vampires that are starved on their own defeated people, seeing a fake celebrity there to visit
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:13.160]  them in their kingdom of shame is so disgusting and it gets worse.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.520]  Look at how Kim Jong-un operates. Threatening to nuke everyone, threatening to kill everyone,
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.480]  just like the globalist. Do what we say or Al-Qaeda will blow up America. Big sis ought
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.720]  to marry Kim Jong-un. She was just saying last week terrorists will attack if you don't
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.400]  give us unlimited Homeland Security funding. Holder, give us the guns or more kids will
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.400]  die.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.000]  We know you got wind up toys doing these shootings, buddy. They're all under government psychiatric
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.080]  care. One of them was Air Force run in Colorado. I mean, we know you're using terror to keep
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:46.880]  us under control as well. You just had a richer, more powerful nation to suck off of. And you've
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:51.080]  taken our wealth and destroyed it, but you use the same system of control.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.480]  And you will debase us down to North Korea level because it's not just about you having
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.840]  all the power. It's about you watching us suffer. That's why you want us dependent and
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.960]  under your control because you're the same diseased, rotting, ugly, demonic filth. Look
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:11.040]  at big sis. Look at Obama. Look at all these people. And they're just mercenaries for the
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040]  bankers.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:17.800]  Look at the top bankers. They are ugly, unhappy, wicked, turned over to evil people who themselves
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.600]  go to celebrity banquets constantly to sit up there like peacocks and be worshiped. They
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:29.760]  are empty, soulless, fallen, cancerous people who took over because they're anti-human and
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.880]  don't follow the regular codes that we do.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.640]  And that doesn't make them strong. It makes them degenerate. And I'm telling you, if I
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:42.320]  ever see Dennis Rodman, I'm getting in his face. And I just get nauseous, nauseous seeing
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.440]  Kim Jong Il. But they're an expression of what all mega tyrants become, of what all
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:53.960]  big government and big corporations creates, the unaccountability, the thuggish mafia
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960]  behavior.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:01.320]  And I swear, eternal resistance against all of these scum. We'll be back with your calls.

[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.940]  lived in this neighborhood for years. We have an alarm system and all of our doors have
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:10.680]  dead bolts. They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:15.720]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry and
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:21.120]  my guns. I kept thinking, what if my family had been home? The police officer said that
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.280]  more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.640]  The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:37.760]  stop an intruder. Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed

[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.980]  Healthy colon, happy life. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:36.100]  why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:40.880]  available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.620]  retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:51.840]  to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:59.680]  and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.160]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:09.760]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:16.500]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:22.280]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.720]  one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:31.960]  is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:35.760]  outside your door. What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:41.940]  life and death for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:47.260]  number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:51.200]  that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:57.360]  watch my video now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.360]  crisis123.com.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:16.120]  By the way, they have different types of extreme tourism, shock tourism, where tens of thousands
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:20.640]  of Americans and Europeans go to North Korea every year and they post the videos online
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:25.920]  and it's to make fun of the starving people and to get into all the evil and to pose with
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:32.160]  the soldiers. Yeah, there's war tourism and it's a big thing with yuppies and trendies.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:37.120]  Another thing is people with beards. Every guy's got a big beard and they act goofy and
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:43.680]  they make jokes. The archetype is like the guy in that new viral Oreo ad where you're
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.760]  into the tyranny, you're into it being a joke.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.240]  And that's what they're saying about Dennis Rodman. It's funny, it's cute. Look at Kim
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:56.720]  Jung-un, he's a joke. You go to the comedy stores or costume stores and there's Kim Jung-il
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.360]  tongue cleaners. It's all funny, him chasing young girls on the beach. That'd be like making
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.840]  jokes out of Hitler, which they now do about it.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:13.080]  It's funny and Holocaust jokes and communist jokes. They have Mao Tse Tung restaurants
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.880]  where the trendies go. He killed 80 plus million people. They debate 60 something million to
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.720]  84 million. The State Department and CIA say 60 something million, they put him in, they
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.320]  should know. The Chinese say 80 something million, look it up.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:33.200]  And it's all a big joke. Yeah, there's a new one, 42% of Oscarians think Hitler rule wasn't
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:40.440]  all bad. How about your country getting bombed and invaded, how was that? 20 million Germans
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:47.380]  died in that war, only 2 million of the soldiers. Didn't go too good for them either. And again,
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.920]  things are so decadent now. Yesterday I walked out of a restaurant.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.840]  I went and had a meeting with one of my IT guys after the Sunday show. We had to have
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:01.080]  a meeting about some architecture purchases we're gonna make here in the IT architecture.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:09.380]  And I'm walking out, it's sunset at about 7.15. And there's a big giant cell tower right
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.500]  there at the restaurant, behind it next to some office buildings, or actually on top
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.240]  of it. And there was signs about don't get close, it says radiation.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:23.600]  So I'm shooting a video going, notice they say that it's dangerous, but then if you tell
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.360]  people cell phones will give them cancer, they think you're a kook. And some woman is
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.720]  in a car parked about 10 feet away, she starts laughing. So I turned the camera off, the
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:34.000]  iPhone off, turn around and I go, hey, what's going on?
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.360]  And she's laughing going, what are you talking about laughing at me? Cuz she heard me talking
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.040]  about cancer. And I went, nothing, it's all funny, isn't it? She didn't like that, her
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.600]  boyfriend didn't like it. And I could tell, they were laughing at us aggressively. They
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.400]  were laughing to mess up the video shot.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:55.060]  They were like, what are you talking about, huh? What? Cuz if she'd have been laughing
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.880]  just cuz she was uncomfortable, I would have explained it to her. She was like, huh, what
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.380]  are you? I mean, what are you? And I was like, no, everything's fine, nothing, nothing, it's
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.380]  good for you.
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:11.800]  Government loves you, and she went, huh? And then started her car and drove off. So I shot
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:20.600]  another video that you can see that's up at infowars.com that has a nice title for everybody.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:27.080]  Dial R for radiation. Alex Jones discovers the wondrous new vitamin R for radiation.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.300]  That's up at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. It's a little short video, but that's the
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:36.200]  spirit of it. Because everything's been given to them. They're living on the carcass of
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:42.760]  the richest, greatest country ever. That hardcore, vicious, smart, aggressive, the most inventive,
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.780]  the most trailblazing.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:48.160]  Everybody came here through incredible hardship. I don't care what color you were, whether
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.760]  you were Chinese, black, white, you name it. Super hard continent, wars, you name it. Building
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:02.840]  a continent and a civilization out of nothing. The pinnacle of power, strength, ruggedness,
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:09.360]  piracy, criminality, Christ-likeness, everything that was here. The good, the bad and the ugly,
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.000]  this was it.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.200]  And now there's the soft nothings who just think it's funny to laugh at Death and Destruction
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.220]  and Dennis Rodman hanging out with a mass murdering scumbag. Who isn't even a mass murdering
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:29.600]  scumbag like his grandfather, who actually took power, was in a big war, killed a bunch
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.820]  of people and set up a cult for himself.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:38.480]  That guy I don't like, but I can respect him. Then there's his pathetic son and all the
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.560]  horrible things he did. And then this guy, that's the cherry on top is that it's a soft,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:52.120]  weak, pudgy hand person who's never been in a fistfight. Never had to get a paycheck,
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:56.960]  never gone hungry, and now gets to strut around with people worshiping him like God.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.400]  They say the sun comes up because of him and the birds sing, actually say that. And that
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:09.160]  the magic lights are seen around him by a horrible tyranny that has the people literally
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.240]  worshiping him. And then I have to see people making jokes about him and now I've gone off
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.340]  into the Netherland ranting about this.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:22.360]  It fundamentally freaks me out and is the greatest poster child for everything I've
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.960]  ever talked about. With this cult of the state and the people that want to become something
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.920]  through the state. And as the state gets bigger, they will ascend. No, you will wreck everything.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:39.000]  And people that say the state created civilization. No, the state is the managers of civilization
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.880]  that end up being the farmers on us, the slaves on the plantation. And I want a worldwide
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:50.080]  revolt of humanity against the technocrats. I want true liberta.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:30:01.200]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.400]  of freedom worldwide. I am your host, Alex Jones. I want to go to some of your phone
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.800]  calls and I've got to get into this cancer news. What the globalists are striving for
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:48.720]  some pretty amazing information that I haven't covered probably in a decade. There's so many
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.480]  times that I'll mention something. I'll remember I haven't talked about it in ages because
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.920]  years go by so quickly, at least they do for me. But everybody I talked to says things
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:03.640]  are accelerating. But North Korea has cut its hotline for the first time in 50 years
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:10.880]  or more since 53. It's almost 60 years or is 60 years and is threatening nuclear attack
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.960]  on the US or its neighbors and they can hit Japan very easily.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.200]  They can also hit California. It's a question of would the missile actually go into orbit
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:24.600]  and come back down and they're gonna have to keep DC-10s in the area circling to shoot
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:32.120]  that sucker down. They use again particle beams to do it. Directed energy weapons. Man,
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:41.840]  I tell you. Just insane times to be alive. Just totally insane. And again, who's threatening
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.840]  this?
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:46.520]  One scumbag tyrant against another group of tyrants that have taken over our country.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:51.360]  And if you are worried about your safety, get a dog.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:57.240]  Can we play that one more time? That took my breath away. That's the one, the only job
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.380]  of the hud on our show premiering here.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:02.960]  And if you are worried about your safety, get a dog.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:09.720]  Yeah, and I asked the guys for that clip earlier if you just joined us. M4wars.com, prisonbloodit.com,
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.560]  top story. The police will protect you, so turn in your gun. And he's got all these links
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:26.000]  to articles and videos of the police and other people saying that you don't need a gun, get
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.800]  a dog, and that the police will protect you.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.840]  You guys give that clip to Kurt or show him where it is online and also get him to add
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:39.320]  the Veritas video that we were playing on the nightly news last week where the cops
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:45.040]  in station after station are like, get a dog. No, you don't need a gun. Yes, I will come
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.240]  and take your guns. And it was all eastern cities fully controlled by the globalists.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.560]  They're full of great people, but I mean, man, they're really hiring the next wave of
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.600]  police cuz most cops are pro gun cuz they're around guns.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.160]  They know guns make crime go down. They know criminals are gonna have guns anyways, and
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:06.560]  they tend to be more libertarian or constitutionalist. You can call them conservative, paleo conservative,
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.320]  but not in Chicago, not in New York, and that's an oversimplification obviously, not in places
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:13.320]  they control.
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:18.720]  I mean, it's scary to know they will come for our guns and they are the future. Under
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:23.200]  federalization of police, they are just taking departments over everywhere and putting a
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:29.840]  bunch of nanny state weirdos in who have that same control freak look in their eye that
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.040]  I see in the North Korean leadership's eye.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.920]  You all know the look of a craze nut of a control freak nobody who wouldn't have been
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:42.820]  anything in their life and who's so insecure about their powerlessness that they overcompensate
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:49.080]  by acting like total jerks. And it just punches my buttons around those people. I just turned
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:54.680]  like a wild gorilla or something and I'm like, don't you try to dominate me.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.160]  And see, that's the problem. Those of us that are strong, those of us that are dominant,
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.400]  we don't like to act dominant because we're naturally dominant. Dominant just wants to
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.480]  protect people, be strong, build things. We like cool people. We like successful people.
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:14.280]  We like success. And then there's always scum trying to gang up on us and feed off of us
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.000]  and I've had enough of it.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.920]  So North Korean leadership and Obama's people and all of you, just go back to hell where
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:27.280]  you came from. I see what you are, a bunch of ugly chicken neck scum, pathetic trash
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:31.480]  who wanna walk around on red carpets and land in big jet airplanes and have us all live
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.480]  in awe of you.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:35.860]  The way to bring down the new world order is just to hate these people and to spit when
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:40.680]  you see them and to laugh at them and to know they're a bunch of North Korean trash. They
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.120]  are, they're a bunch of North Korean wannabes. All right, I said I'd take your calls. I said
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.360]  I'd get into the cancer news. I got Max Keiser coming up.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.440]  I've got all this other news as well. Man, the economy news we're gonna cover in the
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:38:00.120]  next hour. We got David Knight's piece. How long is that? I know it's excellent. All right,
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.520]  get it ready. I'm gonna take calls quickly. Just have your point ready. I'll go to the
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.200]  next person. I appreciate you calling in.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.440]  Jody in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:15.320]  Thank you. I'm having a call in on this North Korean wonderful piece of work.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:17.320]  Isn't he handsome?
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:24.320]  Yes, I'm along with you there. I think we ought to take him and Dennis Rodman and put
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.240]  him in a room with no windows, lock the door, and both of us go in there with baseball bats
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.240]  and lay about freely.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:36.220]  Well, no, we don't wanna call for any violence against Dennis Rodman, a burnout, reported
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:42.600]  drug addict, just pathetic ringwraith. But I mean, Kim Jong-un is a demon.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:47.240]  Yeah, just say I'm upset once then and then just go to the Korean.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:53.020]  Whatever demonic angel Satan has over North Korea, it's probably Satan himself. Whatever
[01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:58.100]  principality the Bible says has a certain demon over each city, cuz the devil has his
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.800]  top angels.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.200]  Whatever one is there, infest the leader. Cuz I'm telling you, his son is now possessed.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:09.780]  He has the same demonic look, a jack-o-lantern look that the other leaders have. I'm serious,
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:14.000]  look at it. He is possessed.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:22.080]  I saw the report last week when they first announced that North Korea was planning a
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.440]  preemptive against the United States. And I just got to thinking about it cuz I just
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:34.240]  watched Strategic Relocation, and Joel Skousen had said something about a nuclear attack.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:41.320]  Now with this coming out in public news, do you think it might be possible that we could
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:47.800]  be seeing that as a false flag and get hit and it not necessarily be there?
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:53.320]  Absolutely, North Korea is the only, they call it the Herman Empire, and I've done deep
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:40:00.080]  analysis. North Korea is its own Looney Tunes, and it's not just Intel and years of study.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:04.480]  I can look at those people, they are just in another world driving around in 57 Chevys
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.680]  and they can't even tie their shoelaces.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.600]  They sell, this was even in Vanity Fair, confirmed the only meat for sale for the small middle
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:19.560]  class is dead babies and dead people. And that's what they serve is human flesh. It's
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.720]  just total cuckoo land. I mean, look at those generals I'm showing on TV right now. I mean,
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:28.600]  that is just, and I understand why the yuppies think it's funny, but it isn't funny.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.440]  There's millions of people held captive by them that are being fed on by them right now.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:37.140]  That's why I start talking about making sick jokes about it cuz it makes me sick too. It
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:41.200]  makes me sick. Just get it off the screen, get it off, get it off. Seriously, I can't
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.280]  handle it anymore. God bless you, ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.520]  I mean, it's just look at all those little soft toadies. I've seen it a million times
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.520]  in government. And notice all the police chiefs that are up there saying ban guns and the
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.840]  Congress people, they all have that weird softness to them. All the police chiefs and
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.200]  sheriffs that are out there pro gun and anti tyranny, they all look really tough and mean
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.160]  and they've got light in their eyes because they have an instinct to want to actually
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.640]  help people.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:16.320]  People always looks like little soft people. I'm so sick of them. I'm sick of them ruling
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:23.240]  over this. I'm tired of it. It's backwards. Going back thousands of years ago, scum started
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:27.540]  getting together to dominate the strong and make us their slaves. That's how this works
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:28.540]  and I'm sick of it.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:33.400]  And if you stop bending over, it won't ever get to this point. Let's go to another call
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:39.040]  here. Let's talk to Scott in California, says is a ammo manufacturer. You have an article
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.800]  about that. Almost every ammo manufacturer, they're estimating over 90% are now officially
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.800]  sold out.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:49.760]  I talked to a major distributor, one of the biggest in the country. He's looking around
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.480]  for ammo two weeks ago and he said by April, they're going to be sold out nationwide and
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.640]  guns. Then I talked to another gun dealer, was told the same thing. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.440]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:03.440]  You bet.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:09.360]  I waited all last week because I wanted to bring this to you personally. We're a small
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:16.040]  ammunition manufacturer and we would like to make a pledge to the American people and
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:21.440]  that pledges that we will sell our ammo to civilians first and I'm seeing this all over
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.920]  the place is that one of the big reasons that ammunition is so hard to get is that all the
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:33.120]  manufacturers are fulfilling law enforcement and government and military contracts first.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:39.400]  Let me tell you what's happening. I mean, I agree. This is a total victory here. This
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.000]  is the blueprint for total victory all over the country. It was like five, then it was
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  10.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.200]  I saw an article last night where it's over 50 major manufacturers and that's most of
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.680]  them are now saying they're not going to sell to the feds or any other municipalities for
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:00.080]  victim disarmament for the citizens and they're looking to see if that municipality is pro
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.600]  gun and I agree. They should only sell to citizens and municipalities that are pro gun
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.360]  and show our real muscle before they shut us down with a industry boycott.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.480]  See, they're trying to bankrupt the gun industry with lawsuits and stuff. It's time for the
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:20.040]  gun industry to bankrupt them. You've got to fight fire with fire. Go ahead, sir.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.360]  Yeah, so I want to throw down the gauntlet to all the other manufacturers. Now I understand
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:31.160]  there's the police loophole.com website with firearm manufacturers who are saying they
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:38.880]  won't sell guns to municipalities or the like that they aren't allowed to sell to the people
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.840]  and that's a good start.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:44.840]  But what good are guns without ammunition? And what we have to have is all the ammunition
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.320]  manufacturers step up and say we are going to fill civilian orders first, not last.
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.440]  And let me tell the listeners, you can confirm this and tell us about your company if you
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:58.080]  want, because I want to check it out. I believe you, but I want to verify it as well. And
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.760]  I'm also a capitalist, maybe become a sponsor, not that you need any sponsorship, I'm sure.
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:08.280]  They have under EPA regulations past 20 years ago, but implemented last year, they always
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.320]  grandfathered it. They're shutting down all the lead mines in the US, so they're having
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.420]  to go get it out of aircraft and stuff.
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:18.520]  The only place that has big lead mines we're allowed to get it from is China. And they're
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.480]  talking about an embargo now, because they called for us to have our guns taken where
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.320]  we can't get the lead. Go ahead.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:31.240]  Right, I believe it. The primary source for our bullets is we're using copper bullets,
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:36.840]  so hopefully that won't impact us too much. Am I allowed to mention my company's ammo?
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:39.240]  Yeah, yeah, mention it. I want some ammo, though.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:47.280]  All right. We're Monolithic Munitions. Our website is monolithicmunitions.com. And we're
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.280]  very small manufacturer.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.560]  How much do you produce a month?
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.240]  We're about 5,000 to 10,000 rounds a month at this point.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.280]  I love it, though. We need all sorts. See, listen, them shutting it down and buying 2
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.120]  billion rounds to dry it up and doing all this is only making all these small manufacturers
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:08.680]  open up. And then there's all these small gun manufacturers opening up. I just love
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.960]  it. I just love supply and demand.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.480]  We're gonna stomp their butt in the ground. Listen, I gotta jump, brother. Send an email
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:18.640]  to showtipsatinfoawars.com. We'd like to talk to you more, God bless. Okay, I'm gonna stop
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:24.880]  right there. This next report tells it all, and I'm gonna come back with your calls.
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.480]  This next report tells it all. CBS News went out and did a report, but they said, Pamplin
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.760]  ordinance not enforced during South by Southwest. The city's claiming you can't hand out literature
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.480]  anywhere in the city. That's a total fraud. When the police were put on the spot, they
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:42.200]  refused to enforce it after we made a big stink out of it.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.480]  And this just shows the incredible tyranny that's going on. And then they said we couldn't
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:51.480]  have bumper stickers on our car. So that shows how far they wanna take all this. Here is
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.560]  David Knight's report. What is your line in the sand?
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:05.400]  March 6th, 1836, the battle for the Alamo. 177 years ago, we still remember and celebrate
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:11.240]  their bravery. But what did they die for? It wasn't Anglo versus Mexican. It was people
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:18.080]  of every tongue, tribe and race standing against tyranny. They could have gone along quietly.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.440]  They could have surrendered and surrendered their freedoms, but they didn't. They drew
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.240]  their line in the sand and said we'll die before we give up our freedoms. Well, Colonel
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.920]  Travis drew a line in the sand at the Alamo, and 60 years before the Alamo, the founders
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:41.320]  of this country drew the line at a small tax on tea. Where do you draw the line on tyranny?
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.300]  As I returned to Austin, I found that like cities all over America, corporatists were
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:52.640]  trying to deny basic freedoms by intimidation. South by Southwest is big business here in
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:58.080]  Austin. It's a huge industry show for music, film and interactive media. And they seem
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:02.880]  to think they own Austin for that week. As Infowars is handing out our monthly magazine
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:08.760]  for free, South by Southwest got some Austin police officers to issue warnings, then tickets
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.360]  when we wouldn't stop. But there is no ordinance against handing out free information on public
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:16.360]  streets, whether or not South by Southwest is in town.
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:21.360]  Well, I had my car parked there with some banners on the side, and that was illegal.
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.360]  So they told me they were going to give me a ticket and I was going to get in trouble
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:30.360]  just because I had my banners there. I had some magazines in front of the car. So it
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.360]  is true. We had to hassle with it.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360]  They told you they couldn't hand them out. We got a ticket.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.360]  Yeah, and then this cop, he was giving out warnings to everybody, even people that weren't
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:46.360]  giving away free logs. Yeah, they got tickets as well. They actually, this guy wasn't harassing
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:52.360]  us. He was saying that we can't give away more magazines because we are not a sponsor
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  of South by Southwest.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  Did you hear that now, South by Southwest people saying the cops are harasses because
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:03.360]  the cops are now behaving like they should know the Constitution. They're now having
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.360]  people come up and harass us saying you can't on city streets hand a magazine out because
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:17.360]  you're not South by Southwest. They now say they own Austin. Does the Chronicle own Austin?
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.360]  Because nothing stops people that aren't backing down. Nothing stops people that are
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  willing to die. Nothing stops 1776. Nothing stops it. You got that scum? Nothing.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:43.360]  I'll close with this. The words for V for Vendetta. Flesh and blood, it dies. It's not
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:53.360]  bulletproof. But ideas, ideas are bulletproof. You got that? I'm bulletproof. Forever.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:59.360]  We're all bulletproof when we stand in the light and stand for liberty. And only you
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:07.360]  pirates can go straight to hell. I salute all of you that came out here to stand against
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:15.360]  these straw men, to stand against these thugs, to stand against these control freaks that
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:20.360]  thought they'd come here with their trendy Hollywood mafia crap. And tell us they wrote
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  our lives. They don't write everything. Liberty or death. Liberty or death. Liberty or death.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.360]  Take all the listeners that came down here in a flash protest. You folks are awesome.
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.360]  And I know I keep saying that, but it is so humbling to sit here and talk to you. I want
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:52.360]  to say this. I salute you, those that actually are in a trance and they're awake and understand
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:58.360]  what's happening. You are the founders of the new republic. The globalist authority
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:04.360]  taken over the old republic. And we will restore the great republic again. And as the
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:14.360]  pirates try to oppress the people that will only make more of us awaken. The answer to
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:29.360]  1984 is 1776. The answer to 1984 is 1776. 1776. 1776.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.360]  All right, great job to Cari Jackson and David Knight. David Knight put that together at
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.360]  his house on his own computer, working over the weekend to get the information out. We're
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.360]  going to come back with more calls and then I guess I'll have to go into overdrive or
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:46.360]  something. You know what? I promise to get to the cancer news. Let me cover a big secret
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:51.360]  next, then I'll take some calls. Then we'll get Max Keiser's coming on. But Zachary and
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.360]  others, your calls are coming up. Again, I'm Alex Jones. You're listening to the Infowars
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:00.360]  worldwide radio transmission for liberty. Please stand by.

[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:07.360]  Ty Bollinger here. Once again, real life, real stories. And he discovered Carnivora,
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:12.360]  was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends and his
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.360]  patients. My dad was a family physician. He was a medical doctor. Almost all the symptoms
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.360]  were either diminished or gone. Amazing product, amazing results. It's like an amazing thing
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was the Carnivora that
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:33.360]  did it. And a lot of patients got better ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:37.360]  Here's the toll free telephone number to call to access the Carnivora telecast at
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:48.360]  carnivora.com on Tuesday, March 12th, 8 p.m. Eastern Time. Call 1-888-694-9666. That's 1-888-694-9666.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:53:00.360]  Once again, 1-888-694-9666. Visit c-a-r-n-i-v-o-r-a dot com or call 1-866-VenusFly to order now.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:06.360]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, it gives added peace of mind. Burglars look for
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:12.360]  houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional burglars
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:17.360]  into thinking someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living alone, it gives me
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:22.360]  great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:28.360]  pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home. Fake
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:33.360]  TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer. And they're so easy to
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:38.360]  use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus, they're so affordable that we
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:45.360]  have one upstairs and downstairs. Fake TV is only $34.95. Order your fake TV by calling
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:56.360]  877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:25.360]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:32.360]  All right, if you're tuning in via radio, you can just type in to a search engine immortalized
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:39.360]  cell line to find out about this. And the reason this is so important is the globalist
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:45.360]  since the 50s have been writing about this, but intensely the last 20 years in their different
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:51.360]  eugenics publications, one line of immortality they believe they're going to achieve, whether
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.360]  that's real or not, that's what they're building this whole world government for. Build a world
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  government to dumb us down, soft kill us, exterminate us.
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:03.360]  They publicly say 80 to 90%, but there are more internal documents that we've published
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  when we dig them up, are 99%. You don't tell the general crew, hey, we're going to kill
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  everybody because they can do the math. Well, then you're going to kill me. No, they said
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:16.360]  we're going to kill 80%. But then in the higher level meetings, it's we're going to kill everybody.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.360]  And then the 1% that's allowed to live in the new magical kingdom they're going to build
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:27.360]  will merge with computers. And that's the dominant line that Kurzweil and others run.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.360]  And this is the religion that the TED cult and that's a mid-level deal that people pay
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  $8,000 to be part of. They're just the useful idiots actually funding the higher level cult.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:43.360]  That's what they're setting up. That's what the UN is about, all this stuff. And it's
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  a race. So they've got the development line for the cybernetic interfaces for extended
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  life. And then they've got the immortalized cell line area.
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:05.360]  And I want to show TV viewers, radio listeners, just search this, Henrietta Lacks. And she
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:12.360]  was born in 1920, died in 1951. And she died of a very fast-acting cancer that just killed
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  her in about a month. And if you read the science legacy, they found that most cells
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:27.360]  will start dividing. They'll become cancerous when they try to repair their DNA and start
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.360]  mutating. Normal cells will start dividing slower than you die because your cells don't
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.360]  replenish themselves.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.360]  But generally before that happens, others learn how to fix themselves and start mutating
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:42.360]  and take over. And I'm oversimplifying this. This is so important. I'm gonna do a whole
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:46.360]  report on it this week. I will do it this week with Aaron Dykes. But just to give you
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.360]  a forte of what's coming up, then we'll air the special report here, let's say by Friday.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  I'll probably shoot it today or tomorrow, then he'll put it together for Friday.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:58.360]  And it said the cells from her tumor were given to researcher George Galloway, who discovered
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  that Henrietta cells is something he'd never seen before. They could be kept alive and
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:08.360]  grown and did not die. Generally they die within a few days just cultured.
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:16.360]  But even without the medium, these cells stay alive and continue to replicate and stabilized.
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:22.360]  So it is the Lazarus cell. They use that term in some literature. It's also been picked
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:26.360]  up by some of the video game manufacturers that put out zombie movies and things.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:33.360]  But when you see a movie, the latest remake of I Am Legend or The Last Man Alive on Earth,
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  and you see the remake and they have a cancer vaccine that kills most people, but turns
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:45.360]  other people down the road, doesn't happen right away, into undead. They can't die unless
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:52.360]  you totally chop them up. They are one giant cancer. Their cells have been made immortal.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:59.360]  And when you get into it, this has got the NSA right now going crazy. This is one of
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:03.360]  the biggest secrets. And by secrets, it's in the literature, but they don't want it
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:08.360]  in the popular culture. That's why their literature admits it all. But when a show seen as a pop
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:13.360]  show that actually reaches people on talk radio, TV, that reaches a wide audience, the
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.360]  unwashed audiences they see us, this is not supposed to be talked about.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:21.360]  And so what it does is you're not literally a zombie. Your heart's still beating everything
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:27.360]  else. But it turns all your cells into immortal cancer cells. Now, obviously, there's going
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.360]  to be mutations. It's going to kill most people. So they're going to test it on us in the new
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:35.360]  cancer vaccines that are coming up. And I've studied the groups involved in that. The U.N.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:39.360]  is involved. They're going to test their immortality mutation shot on us.

[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:55.360]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:59:00.360]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:04.360]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:10.360]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:15.360]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:20.360]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:25.360]  Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:30.360]  need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:34.360]  phone calls right now and others will get to talk to Max Kaiser. We got so much news
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.360]  coming up in the shower right now. Let's go to Zachary in Florida. You're on the air.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:43.360]  Go ahead, sir. Welcome. Hi, Alex. How you doing? Pretty good, brother. I'm I've been
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:50.360]  listening to your show for about two years and I'm only fourteen and I absolutely love
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:56.360]  love your work. You do an excellent job. But the main reason why I wanted to call was that
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:03.360]  I have a YouTube channel. Right. And they've been trying to Google's been trying to shut
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:13.360]  my YouTube video down by following filing false copyright since I put out a video about
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:19.360]  about how they want to ban most guns. And they're trying to shut my YouTube channel
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:23.360]  down. Yeah, just to be clear, they're not doing it with big people like myself. Well,
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.360]  actually, they have some. But we've confirmed thousands of Facebook's are suspended or killed
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.360]  if you promote the Second Amendment even politely.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:35.360]  If you post a Washington Post link with some news about this program, they shut you down.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.360]  And yeah, it's being done selectively to the little guys. And if they can get away with
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:44.360]  it with you, they'll get away with everybody. It's just amazing. And people say, well, just
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:49.360]  leave YouTube. You know, it's their private property. No, they operate as a public commons
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:53.360]  and you're following the rules and they're misappropriating those rules, engage in false
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:59.360]  advertising. And that's what's going on. We should all invade YouTube. We're there because
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:03.360]  that's over half the video views in the world.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:09.360]  It's so ridiculous because I put out a video about George H.W. Bush and about his New World
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:19.360]  order. Crap. You know, the speech in 1991. And they filed a copyright claim by by MTV.
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:26.360]  MTV filed a copyright claim on an 18 second clip of George H.W. Bush. So I told YouTube
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:33.360]  I'm tired. I'm really sick and tired of. And was it even from number one? That's a pool
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:38.360]  camera from C-SPAN, which is paid for at that time by the government. So, yeah, that's a
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:46.360]  false claim. Was it even from MTV? No, it was even it was a news broadcast from MSNBC.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.360]  No, no. And that's not owned by Viacom. Last time I checked, which owns MTV, what you do
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.360]  is, you know, you file a notice under fair use. That's clearly fair use.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:01.360]  It's so ridiculous. And I just don't understand why they want to shut my YouTube.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.360]  Sir, they want to shut you down because we're hurting them. They're involved in a criminal
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:10.360]  takeover and now people are waking up. So they want to shut down. What they shut down
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.360]  is viral spread. If we have some meme on one of our Facebook shows, got millions of people
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:17.360]  total between our 10 Facebooks or so.
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.360]  Three hundred something thousand, our biggest one that was a fan site they gave us. If something's
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:25.360]  going viral, they kill it. People say, well, why do you stay on there? Because that's where
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:31.360]  the people are. Like, hey, the city of Austin told you, you can't hand out magazines in
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:36.360]  Austin. You know, the South by Southwest complained. Well, I went down there and protested it and
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:37.360]  they backed off.
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.360]  And the point is, they'll probably do it again. I'll have to go back on there again. I mean,
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  they will overrun us if we keep kissing their butts. So I say start more accounts, keep
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  uploading and upload under different names. Say YouTube banned this video, make a big
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:53.360]  deal out of it.
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.360]  And everybody realized while we've still got YouTube and Facebook and the real Alex Jones
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:03.360]  Twitter, you better be using this stuff. They want to shut us down because we're effective.
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.360]  People better realize, folks, now's the time to be fighting like never before. They do
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:13.360]  not want you to hear this show. They do not like the fact that we have street fought up
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  from no stations up to over 150 and huge news websites and are able to do this is unbelievable.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  But it's a testament to we're human, too. The globalists are human. They've been very
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:29.360]  effective. We're effective. You got to get in the fight, folks. You got to get in the
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.360]  fight. And the first few times politically, you'll probably get your butt kicked. So what?
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  It's training. What do they say in the military? Pain is weakness leaving the body. Well, politically,
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:47.360]  the political pain is is defeat leaving the political spectrum. And you just got to go
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  out there and stop caring what people think about you and start standing up for what's
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:53.360]  right.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:05:00.360]  I mean, we're living in an incredibly historical time. We got pure evil coming down on us.

[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:12.360]  system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve

[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:07.360]  There is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television sets. Even
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:14.360]  when the set is turned off, look around the environment we live in. Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:22.360]  and methane have increased since 1958. Earth is being acclimatized. They are turning our
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:29.360]  atmosphere into their atmosphere. We are like a natural resource to them. To keep the planet,
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:37.360]  move on to another. They want benign indifference. They want us drugging. We could be pets. We
[02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:46.360]  could be food. But all we really are is livestock. Our impulses are being redirected. We are
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:51.360]  living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:09:01.360]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:08.360]  Alright into hour number three here. We are here every weekday 12 noon to 3 pm Eastern.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:14.360]  I am your host Alex Jones. The news websites are Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and the
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:22.360]  nightly news site is infowarsnews.com or prisonplanet.tv weeknights 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  Very important. The people book or book note or mark that down. Where to start here today?
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  There is so much I want to talk about with Max Keiser who is actually in the Big Apple,
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:42.360]  New York City right now. He lives in London where he does his RT show and also syndicated
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:48.360]  radio and he's made the bold prediction. He's a former top stockbroker, inventor of the
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:54.360]  virtual trading specialist system used on many stock markets today and he is now of
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:58.360]  course retired from that many years ago and is a journalist and he's broken a lot of big
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.360]  stories but he made his boldest prediction ever. He said he believes that by the end
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:07.360]  of April we'll see the end of the bond bubble and that it's going to pop and he said that
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:15.360]  in the middle of last year and he's been reporting on signs that just doubly confirm his analysis
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.360]  that late April is the time for that.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.360]  So I want to look at what's happening there. Then I want to segue into the Italians saying
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  no to austerity. More and more now the Greeks have seen that it wrecked their country. Higher
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:34.360]  taxes brought in less money. That was the plan to wreck the country. They're pulling
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:40.360]  out of that nosedive at least on the surface and how that ties into the rest of the geopolitical
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.360]  things that we see happening, the stock market and more.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:47.360]  And then the first guy I ever heard talk about Bitcoin years ago, I forget when, he was the
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:52.360]  first guy probably secretly invented it for all I know. There's a rumor for you. He invented
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:58.360]  other stuff. Max Keiser was the first guy I ever heard talk about Bitcoin and now everywhere
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  I go, it's definitely the big buzz, Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin. So we're going to get to
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:05.360]  that.
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:08.360]  That's growing exponentially and my concern is we don't know who created it. Anonymity
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.360]  for the individual is fine, but if we don't know who created it, they could be creating
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:17.360]  an alternative fiat currency to destroy it and then try to discredit the entire movement
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:21.360]  that I think is a great idea. I want competing currencies, but Max, I know you're chomping
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  to talk about how you invented Bitcoin because I got a sneaking suspicion you might be involved.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:30.360]  And I know some folks in Austria too might be involved, but I'm just going to leave it
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:34.360]  at that. I know there's a certain crowd that might be involved. Okay, I think I've said
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:39.360]  too much, but Max seriously here, I'm just concerned they could crash it and then come
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.360]  after everybody, but let's not go there first.
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:47.360]  What is happening with your big prediction? Some developments I saw you tweet over at
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:52.360]  Max Keiser, over to Real Alex Jones following us over there at Twitter. And I'm excited
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.360]  to hear your analysis on this implosion because I hope you're wrong about it because I think
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:01.360]  that they'll just get more power out of it. Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:07.360]  Yeah, great to be with you. No, I did not invent Bitcoin. I think the reason people
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:14.360]  say that is because I did invent the virtual currencies and virtual trading back in 1996
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:21.360]  that I have four US patents covering virtual currency, the virtual trading. So people say,
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:27.360]  oh, Max Keiser must be involved in the creation of Bitcoin. That's not the case. I am very
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  excited and very happy that a hacker or a group of hackers did launch Bitcoin in 2009.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:43.360]  It's now a $500 million in circulation and it is taking the globe by storm. And this
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:49.360]  is the Fed killer. When Rand Paul says we need to kill the Fed, when Ron Paul says we
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:56.360]  need to kill the Fed, when I say we need to kill the Fed, Bitcoin potentially is the Fed
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:00.360]  killer. Now getting to my prediction, I said on your show eight months ago that within
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:06.360]  nine months we would have a major financial catastrophe, could most likely be a bond bubble
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:11.360]  burst, and there could be a number of triggers. I'm going to claim victory right here, right
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:20.360]  now, because since I was on your show at that time Bitcoin has made a move from the $5 to
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:28.360]  $6 per Bitcoin range to now it's at $46 heading a lot higher. It's up 200% this year. There
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:34.360]  are many Bitcoin millionaires now, myself included, that have become Bitcoin millionaires
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:42.360]  based on this historic move up from $5 or $6 to now $46, up 200% this year.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.360]  And in fact I remember it was zone nine, zone nine you told me to get into Bitcoin, I probably
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  should have. My problem is the speculative bubble, what about it as a bubble?
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:56.360]  It's volatile, it's going to be volatile, but it doesn't qualify as a bubble. A bubble
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:02.360]  would mean there would be oversaturation and people owning it across the spectrum, like
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:08.360]  Nasdaq stocks in 2000 were a bubble. The bonds are in a bubble. The stock market in 87 was
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:14.360]  a bubble. Bitcoin is not owned yet by nearly anywhere near the penetration it could get
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:19.360]  to, Alex. Let me explain the potential for Bitcoin. It could conceivably capture 1 to
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:25.360]  10% of the global forex transactions. That would mean an implied price for Bitcoin moving
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:33.360]  from $46 to $100,000, potentially $1 million per Bitcoin. There's only going to be $21
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:37.360]  million ever created in existence and that will be it. They've already had $10 million
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:43.360]  created, 25 new Bitcoins are created every 10 minutes and that's the rate at which these
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:49.360]  are entering the economy. The Federal Reserve System hates it. They would love to kill it,
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:54.360]  they're attacking it any way they can, but they will fail. This is what we've been waiting
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:59.360]  for. This is the CyberChrist moment. This is when the activists that have been pushing
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:06.360]  against the Fed are going to win with Bitcoin. Did you just say Bitcoin is the CyberChrist?
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:13.360]  Satoshi Nakamoto is the name of the developer who released Bitcoin in 2009. I call him the
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:19.360]  CyberChrist because he potentially is so much of a game change at this point. This is such
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:24.360]  a quantum leap away from the Federal Reserve System that is killing economies around the
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:33.360]  world that we are going to have a massive global coming to understanding, a revelation
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:39.360]  that finally we are going to escape the nightmare that is a central bank system. This thing
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:43.360]  is a skyrocket and the price, yes, it's going to be very volatile, so keep that in mind.
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:48.360]  You're going to see a lot of price action, but the trajectory is up and has potential
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:53.360]  to go to 100,000 or a million per Bitcoin from the current price of 46. I suggest you
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:59.360]  get Rick Fogvin from Stockholm on your show. He's part of the pirate party in Sweden. He's
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:05.360]  a great guy, he's been covering, he put his entire net worth into Bitcoin two years ago
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:09.360]  and there was a lot of volatility, but he's got a very down to earth analysis of it. He's
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.360]  a very great guy, should happen on your show.
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:17.360]  But again, I know about who supposedly released it, but then it's all very foggy who actually
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:22.360]  designed it. And talking to all the insiders, I mean, what you're saying is basically a
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:27.360]  group of, quote, hackers or IT developers. I mean, as best we know.
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.360]  This is a response. These are activists. You know, we've been trying to, look at the politics
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:34.360]  of America, look at what Ron Paul's been saying now for years. You know, we got to get rid
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.360]  of the Fed, got to get rid of the Fed. And there hasn't been any traction in any movement
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:42.360]  whatsoever. And hackers understand that privacy is a big issue going forward. You know, the
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:47.360]  privacy is something that is at the heart of what Kim Dotcom in New Zealand is talking
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.360]  about with Mega. You know, Mega has now got over 50 million users. It's becoming a billion
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.360]  dollar company. He calls himself the privacy company. Everything is encrypted, just like
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:17:01.360]  Bitcoin is entirely encrypted. Privacy is the new scarcest resource in the world today.
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.360]  That's what backs Bitcoin, is privacy. It guarantees privacy. And in this day and age,
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  that's a very scarce commodity with every single one of our emails being spied on, with
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:15.360]  millions of CCTV cameras installed everywhere we go. Privacy is one of the rarest commodities
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:19.360]  in the world. That's what collateralizes, essentially, Bitcoin. And that's why it's
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:24.360]  such a valuable currency. And so the activists behind it, this creation, are making that
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.360]  statement the invasiveness of the state. I also noticed that the Austrian school of economists
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:34.360]  like guys like Tom Woods, who you have on your show, at first they were very hesitant
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:39.360]  about Bitcoin. Now they're embracing Bitcoin. The libertarians are now embracing Bitcoin.
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.360]  Lou Rockwell and his crowd are now embracing Bitcoin because they realize what it is. It's
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.360]  a reaction to the criminality at the Federal Reserve with an anonymous...
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:54.360]  Sure, I understand, but Nakamoto is admittedly a fake cutout. Are you Nakamoto? Stop dodging.
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.360]  Right. It's a pseudonym for either one or a group of hackers.
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:03.360]  Yeah, knock it off, Max. Just admit right now you're involved in it. Admit you're involved
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:06.360]  in it. Cut it out. Admit you're involved in it.
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:12.360]  ... currencies going back to 1996. And so I'm very familiar with the need for this.
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:14.360]  I'm very familiar also that my patents... Yeah, I bet you are.
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:19.360]  ... were seized by Wall Street, by a bank on Wall Street, Cantor Fitzgerald. They took
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.360]  those patents off out of the public domain. And this is your way of getting back at them.
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:28.360]  I'm just giving you what's going on in history. They took those patents out of the public
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.360]  domain. They in turn moved the company, Cantor Fitzgerald, to the top floor of the World
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:36.360]  Trade Center, and then they had to deal with their own comic reality. That's their gig.
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:41.360]  That's just their fate. But in the meantime, other people who looked at the virtual currency
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:46.360]  space have said, you know, there is something here that can be done. The Bitcoin protocol,
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.360]  this encrypted currency that's now on the web, and it's becoming a huge industry. There
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:56.360]  are lots of companies now that support Bitcoin. For example, there's a company called BitPay
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:19:01.360]  that is becoming the PayPal of Bitcoin. So they guarantee transactions in Bitcoin.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:07.360]  WordPress, which is one of the biggest templates for running blogs on the internet, now accepts
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:11.360]  Bitcoin. You have stores opening up around the web...
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:15.360]  No, no, we're trying to figure out how to accept it as well.
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.360]  ... encrypted currency. There's no way in the world anywhere else you could send $1,000
[02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:24.360]  from Alex Jones to anyone in the world for virtually free. It doesn't cost anything.
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:29.360]  It gets instantaneous, and you get 100 cents on the dollar. The banks hate this because
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.360]  it cuts into their profit margins, but this is what's needed to do battle against the
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:38.360]  banking terrorists like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Warren Buffett, Federal
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:43.360]  Reserve. These guys are going down. Bitcoin is the spear to take them down.
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:49.360]  Amazing. Now, I want to get into the larger geopolitical issues, but I agree. True fiat
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:53.360]  currencies that are open source are what we need to go to because the globalist...
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:57.360]  My prediction is eight months ago, I predicted that there would be a huge crash...
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:00.360]  Stay there. We got to go to break. We got to go. Stay there.
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:33.360]  ... 100% natural silver gel. Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:38.360]  which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface. But rather, we have formulated
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:43.360]  our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:51.360]  and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively. Visit www.silverlungs.com

[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:03.360]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:08.360]  affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:13.360]  of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:18.360]  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:23.360]  Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin

[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:33.360]  intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries

[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:08.360]  Strange days are here, my friends.
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:13.360]  Strange days have found us.
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:16.360]  They're going to destroy us.
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:18.360]  Strange days have found us.
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:22.360]  Unless we make provision, our next cause is our guest.
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:26.360]  Bitcoin, very fascinating. I want to get you back in the next few weeks when you can do it.
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.360]  Or you're here in the US, how about you come down here to Austin, we'll do a Bitcoin special
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:36.360]  in studio that can interview you for an upcoming, unannounced new film, folks. I'm finally going
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:40.360]  to do that for two years, not making a new film. But Max, getting into your prediction,
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:42.360]  because you've never made something that bold.
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:47.360]  I'm claiming victory. I'm victorious. I'm claiming victory. And if anyone wants to debate
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  me on this, they can call me up live. I'm doing a library show this Friday for two hours
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:56.360]  starting at 5 p.m. I'm PRN in New York City. You can find it, you can call in, and you
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  can debate me. But I'm declaring victory on this prediction that I made eight months ago,
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:06.360]  which makes me the top prognasticator in the world for 2013 so far.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  Okay, now break down what your prediction is, and then what's really happening in the
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:13.360]  economy that you're saying shows that what you said would happen is starting.
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:18.360]  Well, I said eight months ago that you'd have a major financial collapse, possibly a bond
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:26.360]  collapse, and during that time Bitcoin has made a move from $4 to $46. It's up 200 percent
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  this year. So again, the stock market's trading at a new all-time low against Bitcoin.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  I'm claiming Bitcoin to be a global world currency of major importance, and everything
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.360]  has crashed against it and will continue to crash against it, because all of the hatred
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:43.360]  of the central banking system is being channeled into Bitcoin right now. There are so many
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.360]  millions of people around the world who despise what central banks are doing to their economies
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  that they are now going into Bitcoin. And now there's a peripheral economy around Bitcoin
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:57.360]  with support companies like BitPay that I mentioned and others that are making it easier
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:02.360]  for people to get into this economy. And as I said, WordPress now accepts Bitcoin. My
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:06.360]  site, PirateMyFilm, accepts Bitcoin, has been on for a number of months, and this thing
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:10.360]  is growing. I mean, I believe that your outfit should take a look at it and support this,
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.360]  because this is the single greatest thing anyone can do to fight against central bankers.
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:19.360]  Rand Paul should be on it. The libertarian should be on it. Tom Woods, finally, after
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:24.360]  listening to me for six months, Tom Woods finally has seen the light. I had to school
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:29.360]  Tom Woods once again. He is now a Bitcoin supporter. The libertarians, at first, balked.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:30.360]  Now they support him.
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:35.360]  Well, I haven't been balking for three years, but I want to get into some other geopolitical
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:41.360]  issues other than your invention of Bitcoin. Come on, Max. I want to expand on all of this,
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  okay, because we're seeing major rumblings in Europe. We're now seeing the prognosticators
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:48.360]  saying, get ready for collapse.
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:53.360]  We're now seeing, get ready for another round of bailouts. We're seeing people now refusing
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:57.360]  austerity out of the headlines. The banks have been saved in Europe, but Europe hasn't
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.360]  been saved. I'm gonna show some of those headlines while you're talking to TV viewers. I mean,
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  things are definitely rotting faster. How does that tie into your bond market implosion?
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  Well, it ties in with the fact that for every point up in the Dow Jones, the federal government
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:20.360]  takes on 200 million new debt. They say that the jobless numbers are down and that more
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:24.360]  people, there's more jobs in the economy. That's because the number of people taking
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:30.360]  second and third jobs is now up by hundreds of thousands of people in America that take
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:35.360]  two and three jobs. And they count those people taking on second and third jobs as a growth
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  in the jobs number. We also see it with Obamacare. Companies are now cutting back on people hours
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:46.360]  per week to 30 because they don't want to pay the Obamacare penalty to those people
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:50.360]  who are up by getting second and third jobs. That counts as new jobs. What about wages?
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  Well, wages are hitting new lows, all-time lows. What about the work participation rate
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.360]  ratio? The worst in history. That is to say that you've got the least number of people
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.360]  actually working in the economy than ever before. But they spin all these numbers as
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:07.360]  a net positive and justification for continuing to ease money and quantitative ease money,
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:10.360]  which is nothing more than a policy scheme where they're buying bonds from banks who
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:15.360]  then sell back to the Treasury and the Fed, who then sell back to Wall Street. And they
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.360]  go back and forth like this, charging each other fees, paying bonuses tied to the fees
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.360]  to keep the bond bubble afloat, and increasing more debt until such time as that debt cannot
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:28.360]  be increased anymore. And then you have the debt bubble. But that could happen in six
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.360]  months. It could happen by April. It could happen tomorrow. In the meantime, people are
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:36.360]  saying, you know what? To hell with all of you. We're just going to create a parallel
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:42.360]  economy based on a real currency like Bitcoin, which is finite. It's not an infinitely
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  printed fiat currency like the dollar. And the cost of transaction is near zero. And
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:52.360]  it's what the founding fathers of America would have insisted upon if they were reinventing
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:56.360]  America today. They would have made Bitcoin the national currency of America. Remember,
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.360]  Ben Franklin said the primary reason America revolted against the British was to get away
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:05.360]  from the Bank of England, because the Bank of England was insisting that America accept
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:10.360]  money with interest attached to it. Franklin said no way. So they created the United States
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:15.360]  of America and the Constitution, which got rid of this albatross, this monstrosity of
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:19.360]  the Bank of England, and they brought in real money issued by the Treasury with no interest
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:24.360]  attached. Then in 1913, you had the Rothschilds and all those punks from the UK get their
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:29.360]  way finally, and they brought the Bank of England into America in the form of the Federal
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:34.360]  Reserve Bank. And we've seen the debt skyrocket every single day. Yeah, we've seen the American
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:39.360]  system killed. You've got to get enslaved populations back to pre-Civil War America,
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:45.360]  the antebellum South. You got people living like slaves for the debt slaves. Got to go
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:49.360]  to break, Max. Stay there. We're going to come right back with Max Keiser. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:49.360 --> 02:30:01.360]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:05.360]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:10.360]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:16.360]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:21.360]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:28.360]  at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:35.360]  in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound. When
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:40.360]  I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds
[02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:47.360]  in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.360]  and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:57.360]  look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately. Start your journey to health and wellness
[02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:03.360]  today. InfowarsTeam.com.
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:32.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:38.360]  We are back live and we are going to take some calls from Max Keiser here in a few minutes
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:43.360]  to get into some other financial news that I was just mentioning. The real currency of
[02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:51.360]  liberty in the future is diversity and true independence and liberty. And it is transmitted
[02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:57.360]  through the different conduits of information. And when the establishment zigzag, that's
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:04.360]  why we're in the seventh issue of Infowars Magazine, big color, glossy, the old Rolling
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:09.360]  Stone style broadsheet full of key information.
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:15.360]  We break down the globalist master plan, try to stir up civil war and crises in this country.
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:19.360]  You now notice the Southern Poverty Law Center that is the Justice Department is saying I'm
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:24.360]  a terrorist and prepare for libertarian groups to blow up buildings. Yeah, how do you demonize
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:29.360]  your enemies? You stage stuff and blame it on them. I mean, it is so transparent. It's
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:33.360]  all broken down in the new issue and it's going to sell out this month.
[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:38.360]  It's already most of them have already sold the 30,000 we keep back. We put 70,000 on
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.360]  the streets in Austin and San Antonio, Texas. The beta test when it's a year old will go
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:49.360]  into syndication in cities across the United States. And we're gearing up for that. A lot
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:53.360]  of legwork to do, but thank you for supporting Infowars Magazine. You can buy them at cost
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:35:00.360]  at cost at Infowarsstore.com or sign up for a 12 month subscription and the shipping is
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:03.360]  included in the cost of the subscription.
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:08.360]  So it's all there. You can also become a micro distributor. I haven't talked about this yet.
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:14.360]  You can get the Infowars News rack and buy them in groups of 50 up to 100 at cost and
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:19.360]  sign up and have 12 issues mailed to you to sell them at your business or office or gas
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:26.360]  station and make the money back or just as a public service, let people take them for
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:27.360]  free.
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:32.360]  But regardless, you can become a micro distributor. They have different deals on that one time
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:37.360]  micro distributor to buy the rack in one month to test it out or sign up for 12 months and
[02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:41.360]  get 50 to 100 or even more mailed to you each month to put in your store, business, church,
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:45.360]  whatever the case is. Because people really pay attention to a big color glossy magazine
[02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:50.360]  now because magazines are going the way of the goony bird. Now there's a vacuum there.
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:53.360]  And of course, financially that doesn't really support us. Be sure about the propure water
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:59.360]  filters, the books, the videos, the T-shirts, all of it at Infowarsstore.com and be sure
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:04.360]  and follow us because I got into the Twitter game late, but only now do I realize I can
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:06.360]  send photos, video links.
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:11.360]  It's such an important tool for us. We only have 170,000 followers. We have a couple other
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:17.360]  Twitters that were fan Twitters. We got about 400,000 total. That needs to be at a million.
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:21.360]  But it's kind of a pop culture thing, so that's why we've not been super successful at it.
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:25.360]  I want to thank those that have helped promote it. Real Alex Jones there at Twitter, go and
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:30.360]  follow us. It's very easy to do. We send a lot of key information out like report Mideast
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:33.360]  War on Bilderberg 2013 agenda.
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:40.360]  All the breaking news is tweeted out from Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and be sure
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  and follow Max as well because his information is very important at Max Kaiser there on Twitter,
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:52.360]  but DHS to purchase more firearms as arms build up intensifies. New Paul Watson article,
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:55.360]  the police will protect you, so turn in your guns.
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:37:00.360]  And they've now been a group of sheriffs have come out and said that they were ordered to
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.360]  have their pay cut in Colorado. I guess the state's in control of that. The county should
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:11.360]  be. And so they were ordered to be anti-gun. Man, you talk about crazy. So that article
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:15.360]  is up there as well. Max, I want to throw a few curveballs at you before we get back
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:18.360]  into the economy and take calls.
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:24.360]  What do you make of the stonewalling about the 2,700 giant armored vehicles, the tens
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:30.360]  of thousands of fully auto machine guns the government's buying, like 7,000 a month, the
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:37.360]  2 billion bullets. And then the stonewalling saying it doesn't exist. But now even Forbes
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:41.360]  has come out and said we looked at it. There are the billions of bullets.
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:46.360]  Why are you stonewalling? We need to quote have a national discussion about this. That's
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:51.360]  the headline. And that's what I've been saying. There is an arms build up. There are checkpoints.
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:56.360]  They're gearing up as if a foreign army is about to invade, but they're pointed at us.
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:02.360]  The manuals say it's for gun confiscation. That will cause a civil war. And I know, I
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.360]  don't believe, because it's in their internal memos that they've leaked, they want to start
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:10.360]  a civil war and label those of us that don't go along with having our pension funds taken,
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:11.360]  guns taken.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:16.360]  They're going to label us terrorist. Max Keiser, what do you make of the, the stonewalling
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:20.360]  undoubtedly has gotten more bizarre. It's like Gibbs saying there are no drone programs
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:22.360]  seven years after the program was public.
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:27.360]  And then admitting aha, it's Wizard of Oz. What is the tactic there and why is the lying
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:31.360]  or do you disagree becoming so over the top cartoon?
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:37.360]  Well, they're frightened. They're frightened. Listen to what Eric Holder just said. He said,
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:44.360]  yes, it's true that HSBC got caught laundering billions of dollars for Mexican drug cartel
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:50.360]  terrorists. Yes, it's true that Wachovia was caught laundering $400 billion worth of Mexican
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:54.360]  money, which is what Wachovia is now, was bought by Wells Fargo. Biggest shareholder
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.360]  is now Warren Buffett.
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:02.360]  We can't prosecute because I fear them. That's the attorney general. We can't prosecute
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:07.360]  HSBC for funding drug cartel terrorists because I fear them. That's our attorney general,
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:12.360]  Eric Holder. Now, of course they're building fortresses inside America. And of course they're
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:20.360]  buying tanks. Just like the Christians who went into the homeland had to build fortresses
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:23.360]  inside the homeland. They're building themselves fortresses because they're afraid of their
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:28.360]  bankers, the monstrous bankers that they've created. They can't apply laws to them. They
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:34.360]  can't handle them. These guys will know that they're in league with the Mexican drug cartel
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:38.360]  terrorists. They're trying to protect themselves. They're scared to death. Eric Holder is a
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:43.360]  scared little bunny hopping around saying, oh my God, HSBC is on the line. Please save
[02:39:43.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  me Obama, hide me. HSBC, Stephen has served HSBC. He wants to find me and he's going to
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:52.360]  kill me. He'll beat America Obama. This guy is the most frightened little weenie hopper,
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:58.360]  bunny hopping loser in America. This is a sad day when you've got the attorney general
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:03.360]  saying he's a frightened of the banks he can't prosecute even though they funded 9-11 terrorism.
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:08.360]  Why are we sending drones across the ocean? For what? To kill who? Little babies in their
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:13.360]  crib? Because Eric Holder and his little crotch is all shrunken up and shriveling up
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:17.360]  like a peanut because he's not a man enough to admit that he fears the banksters? What
[02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:24.360]  a pathetic little, you know, thriller in the expletive. It's so sad. I'm so ashamed and
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  embarrassed. Control your hatred, Lord Vader. Now, now let me just expand on this because
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:36.360]  I have the articles right here for TV viewers. What do you make of Mohammad Karzai coming
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:39.360]  out? Because we know the West runs Al Qaeda and Taliban. That's been admitted literally
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:43.360]  hundreds of times, number two in Al Qaeda, and we're all lucky hanging out at the Pentagon.
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:47.360]  But now he's another cornered rat, so the rats are fighting with each other. He knows
[02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:51.360]  they killed his brother, the biggest opium dealer, to get his cut. He now comes out and
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.360]  says, you've been bombing your own bases. You've been bombing our hotels as a reason
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:00.360]  to stay here. And I said that a year ago at the last big one, six months ago, a smaller
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:03.360]  one, because it clearly is that.
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  Clearly, they are in the league with HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyd of
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:11.360]  London.
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  No, but I mean, now it's coming out that the troops grow the drugs.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:19.360]  They're the biggest co-dealers, drug dealers, heroin dealers, murdering terrorists, some
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:23.360]  sponsors of global terrorism. And they have Eric Holder who got their back. Barack Obama
[02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:28.360]  got their back. It's not a shock. I'm not shocked. That's why Bitcoin came into existence
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:33.360]  because I said, you know what? You guys need to get out of the way because we can't be
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:37.360]  a babysitter because you're just crapping the diapers of the Constitution.
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:40.360]  You need to just get off stage. We need to bring back something.
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:43.360]  But don't the elites get? Let me say something.
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:49.360]  We need a currency that's not compromised by you freaking terrorists like Eric Holder.
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:56.360]  So Bitcoin will triumph, my friend. Bitcoin is the second coming. Bitcoin is the answer.
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:01.360]  And this thing is growing like a weed because people in the liberty movement, people who
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:05.360]  are following Rand Paul, Ron Paul, libertarians, Austrian school, they finally came out of
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:10.360]  my way of thinking. I had to school Tom Woods. I had to school Rand Paul and say, look, this
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:14.360]  is the future. Now they're coming around, which is great because now this thing is going
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:19.360]  to be adopted by millions more people. And these central bankers and commercial bankers
[02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:25.360]  and Wall Street bankers are going to be exterminated, disenfranchised, whittled out of existence.
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:30.360]  All right. Let me let's move slowly here for a few points, because I want to get to this.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:34.360]  Can I just jump in for a second? Yes, it's a big deal.
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:38.360]  The last 12 hours, you had a major story. I don't know if you saw it, but if you go
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:45.360]  to in trade dot com in trade dot com, that's been taken off. That's been taken off line.
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:50.360]  That's been shut down suddenly at three o'clock in the morning just a few hours ago because
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:56.360]  in trade dot com was giving true price discovery on probability for events that were happening
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:01.360]  and for prices of things that were outside of the matrix of these corrupt bankers. The
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:05.360]  insiders are the only ones that are supposed to know that. Just like they shut Hollywood
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:09.360]  stock exchange out of my company because I was showing genuine prices for movies a year
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:14.360]  before they were open and open. So they killed it. They came to Fitzgerald and the board
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:18.360]  of directors colluded in an illegal transaction and they busted up that company just like
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:25.360]  they busted up in trade. They will not allow for accurate price discovery and it's something
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:28.360]  like in trade. Sure, I understand. Let me ask you this question.
[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:33.360]  They killed it. Yeah, I understand. You're pretty wound up today, Max. That's news. That's
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.360]  breaking news. No, no, I understand that's breaking news. I want to go to some phone
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.360]  calls here in just a moment. People want to talk to you about Bitcoin and bonds and some
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:49.360]  other questions. But Max, take North Korea. Obviously, you've got Dennis Rodman, a washed
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:55.360]  up media whore going over there. But the white people made a joke out of a murdering dictator
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:58.360]  meeting with an American like like tyranny's funny.
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:02.360]  It also shows the decadence of some of the public. But then as a larger issue, as North
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:08.360]  Korea insanely threatens to nuke things and cuts off the telephone connection and ends
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:14.360]  the armistice. So the Korean war out of deep freeze, 59 years later, is back. What is your
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:19.360]  take on North Korea and how that feeds into things in the build up towards Middle East
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.360]  war? The armistice was never signed to end the war. The North Korean South Korean war.
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:27.360]  That was never signed. No, I know. So it was it was a cease fire for the armistice, but
[02:44:27.360 --> 02:44:31.360]  it was an armistice meeting for a cease fire. Go ahead. So they ever actually that was never
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:36.360]  actually formally. No, the Dennis Rodman thing is is phenomenal. But, you know, before Dennis
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  Rodman, you had the chairman of Google, Schmidt, go over there on a mission where he was also
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:47.360]  doing the job that you thought John Kerry was supposed to be. John Kerry is the secretary
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:52.360]  of state. Why is Eric Schmidt, the head of Google, making a trip to North Korea, who's
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:57.360]  supposed to be part of the axis of evil? Well, Eric Schmidt's a lot more powerful than Kerry.
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:01.360]  And not John Kerry. You know, John Kerry has been proven to be completely inept, saying
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:06.360]  things like, well, as a diplomat, you know, Dennis Rodman makes a good basketball player
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:10.360]  trying to make jokes about it. Well, John Kerry, what about you doing your frickin job?
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.360]  What about you having some kind of cogent statement that people can understand why these
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.360]  countries are spinning out of control? No, you won't hear anything from John Kerry. No,
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:23.360]  he's counting. I know. What do you think's happening in North Korea? How does North Korea
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.360]  feed into things? Stock has taken over. They're making billions and millions of dollars. That's
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:32.360]  all he cares about. Sure. How does North Korea tie into this? But you notice that before
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:37.360]  a big collapse, wars always start because that helps smokescreen the globalist takeover.
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:41.360]  And I see the Middle East and North Korea. I mean, it looks like things could be lining
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:45.360]  up for something really nasty. What do you expect to see Max Keiser? Well, the hotspots
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:50.360]  are quite numerous. You've got Japan and China are fighting a currency war. You've got North
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:55.360]  Korea is now starting to fight a hot war. You've got Europe involved in a massive social
[02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:01.360]  unrest in the periphery countries. America is dissolving into a new kleptocracy and anti-bellum
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:08.360]  south slave state. And Venezuela now in chaos with the passing of Chavez. And you've got
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:12.360]  hotspots all over the world and no leadership. That's the problem. Because the leaders are
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:17.360]  buying their own bull. Because the leaders are buying their own bull. I think that's
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:22.360]  the big issue here is that when the establishment starts smoking their own dope, get ready for
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:25.360]  cuckoo land. I also predicted on your show six months ago to a year ago that the British
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:31.360]  pound would make new lows against all major trading currencies. I know today that it's
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.360]  just made a new low against all its major trading currencies. So that's another prediction
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:41.360]  for 2013. I put in the win column. I'm batting a thousand. I am the prognosticator of 2013
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:46.360]  so far. Number one. We got to go to calls. Let me ask you one last question. I agree
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:50.360]  things are degenerating quickly. They're talking about all sorts of economic unraveling while
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:52.360]  saying everything's great to the general public.
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:58.360]  But the more internal memos are danger, Will Robinson. So they're going to spin even all
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:02.360]  out depression is milk and honey. Like they've spun things in Greece. Children starving to
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:08.360]  death is a wonderful thing and Greece is doing great. So if you're right about the collapse
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:14.360]  accelerating, how will the public respond as the media announces? The economy's great.
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:19.360]  There are no bullets. There are no checkpoints. There are no armored vehicles. The TSA doesn't
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:24.360]  grab your genitals. The Easter Bunny is real. Santa Claus is real. There are no drones.
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:28.360]  We already talked about this, Alex. I think the public has missed a window of opportunity.
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  Constitution says on our Second Amendment, if Terry comes along, you have a constitutional
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:36.360]  obligation to pick up your firearm and take back your government. The threshold for that
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:41.360]  Terry has passed already in the year 2000 with that thrown election. We've had now 15
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:47.360]  or 20 instances when Terry threshold as per the Constitution has been passed. The NDAA,
[02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:52.360]  the Patriot Act, the list goes on and on. America did not act. Therefore, America has
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:57.360]  no one to blame for itself. America is finished. It's lost its sovereignty. It's over. I'm
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:01.360]  tired of talking about when are Americans going to act or if they're going to act or
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:07.360]  is it time to act? Time to act is passed. Get over it. You're done. Just stop whining.
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:11.360]  I disagree with that. I disagree with that. There's more of an awakening now than ever.
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:15.360]  I totally disagree with that, Max. And I understand that. I know you disagree with it.
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:21.360]  What threshold of tyranny are you looking for? What do you need? What does it take?
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:27.360]  Does John Kerry have to come into your arm and physically, you know, perform an act,
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:32.360]  a disgraceful act, you know, in person? I mean, what is it going to take? What more
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:38.360]  degrading, degrading act by your government do you need before you...
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:43.360]  Hey, what's stopping you? Listen, the feds are going to blow stuff up and blame it on
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:49.360]  us. They want a confrontation. They want to get a physical fight going because we're winning
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:50.360]  the info war.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:56.360]  You have to steal before they get prosecuted as a criminal. How much more? It's gone.
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:59.360]  The threshold's been passed. There's no going back...
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:04.360]  No, it takes a lot of tyranny before... Listen, people are waking up big time right now, Max.
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  Let's go to a phone call. Scott in Colorado wants to ask a bond question. Then we'll go
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:12.360]  to others that have Bitcoin questions and others. Go ahead, Scott. You're on the air
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:15.360]  with Max Kiser, who's had a lot of coffee.
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:21.360]  Hey, Max. First time caller, Alex, love the show. Wanted to know more importantly, what
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:26.360]  do you think the derivative market's going to crash? I mean, I can't understand what
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:30.360]  America's looking at when they look over to Europe. I mean, you've got Ireland going broke.
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:33.360]  You've got Spain that can't control their debt, their GDP's out of control.
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:36.360]  Those countries don't exist. The bullets don't exist. Everything's fine.
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:41.360]  I mean, I've even got guys that, you know, are VPs over at Wells Fargo that say, yeah,
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:45.360]  we see a 5 to 10% market correction, but other than that, we don't see the bond market or
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:47.360]  the derivatives market seeing a major correction.
[02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:52.360]  Right. Well, the derivative market, otherwise known as the shadow banking system, is completely
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  opaque, totally unregulated, and we never see or hear about it until things like the
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:01.360]  London Whale a few months ago blew up and Jamie Dimon and JP Morgan lost, what, six or
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:02.360]  seven or nine...
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:04.360]  It's a lot more. It's all rigged.
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  It won't happen again. So that was the shadow banking system leeching into the real world.
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:13.360]  So behind the scenes in the shadow system, there are all these catastrophes and losses
[02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:19.360]  being made up, but we don't really see it until it makes its way into a form of policy
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:25.360]  initiative, which is called austerity in Europe or Obamacare in America, which is a huge bailout
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:26.360]  of the corporations.
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:31.360]  And what net-net, wages go down, quality of life goes down. America right now on the League
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:37.360]  of Nations in the world for standard of living, quality of life, is a whopping number 16.
[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:44.360]  Number 16, down from number one and heading to number 40. OK, that's where it shows up.
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:46.360]  That's the crisis in the derivatives market.
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:47.360]  All right, Scott, thanks.
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:51.360]  Got to go to break, Max. Max needs Ritalin.
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:55.360]  Turn him back up. Let him take us out to break.
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:51:01.360]  OK, Max, we're going to come right back to you. George, Braun, Tate, Ryan.
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:05.360]  If you're listening, you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day.
[02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:08.360]  If you're listening, you know the economy is not getting better.
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:11.360]  You know gas and food prices are skyrocketing.
[02:51:11.360 --> 02:51:13.360]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:16.360]  For years, we've told you about our friends at e Foods Direct.

[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:03.360]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland?
[02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:07.360]  Did you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:09.360]  and as metal particles into your body?
[02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:13.360]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:17.360]  Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%.
[02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:21.360]  Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function.
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:25.360]  The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione.
[02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:31.360]  The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione
[02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:34.360]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:38.360]  After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market,
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:43.360]  only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion,
[02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:47.360]  the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:52:47.360 --> 02:52:49.360]  It is One World Whey.

[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:44.360]  This is the Alex Jones sing-along hour. Let's get to some more of your phone calls here with Max Keiser.
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:47.360]  Let's talk to a Bitcoin question.
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:51.360]  Tate in Michigan, you're on the air with Max Keiser. Go ahead.
[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:55.360]  Hey Max, I wanted to tell you. You and Stacey are rock stars.
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:54:58.360]  Hey man, love what you're doing. I'm a member of your Silver Liberation Army.
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:07.360]  My question is this. Is Bitcoin a good alternative to dual citizenship for wealth protection?
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:12.360]  I guess the short answer is yes because it's highly portable.
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:17.360]  So you could put $100,000 on a thumb drive or even memorize the address
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  and you could go anywhere in the world and upload that information and there'd be your $100,000.
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:25.360]  So it's a way to completely bypass the exchange.
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  No, it is a giant idea and revolutionary and I'm all for it.
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:34.360]  I'm just saying the first big vehicle to be successful will probably be brought down by the system
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:38.360]  or it will bring the system down so it's a big deal.
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:42.360]  Well, I don't know what you just said.
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:43.360]  Pardon me?
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:48.360]  I don't know what you just said. I mean, you're just agreeing that it's a huge initiative.
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:52.360]  It's big and I don't understand why there's not more...
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:56.360]  No, I'm just saying people... Listen, I'm just saying...
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:56:01.360]  I'm the only guy banging the drum on Bitcoin in the alternative media space since it started in 2009.
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:05.360]  No, well Max, I had you on about it today and I've had you on before.
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:08.360]  Where's Rand Paul and Ron Paul?
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:12.360]  I know. I'm just saying there's risk for people that don't have a lot of money.
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  Other people that have a lot of money should all put a little bit into it politically just to try to make it successful.
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:25.360]  But I'm also up here saying anything experimental or exploratory has serious dangers.
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:27.360]  But the bigger system is the ultimate danger.
[02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:31.360]  So that's why I've supported you in the Silver Army. I supported you on the Bitcoin.
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:37.360]  I understand you're really excited about your invention doing so well today, but calm down right now.
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:40.360]  Okay, Tate, anything else?
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:42.360]  I know. You guys keep it up. I love what you're doing.
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:44.360]  Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Tate.
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:48.360]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut. You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.360]  Yeah, I'd like to talk to that financial terrorist, Mr. Max Keiser.
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:55.360]  I mean, the poor bankers are probably peeing their pants right now.
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:05.360]  Anyway, the question is, Ken, what's the best place to be if the market does blow up because of this bubble that's going to happen in April?
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:10.360]  Should we be in gold? Is GLD okay? Or if that's all leverage, that's bad?
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:13.360]  Or should we be completely out? Et cetera, et cetera.
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:17.360]  And what are the indicators that might basically be leading to this?
[02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.360]  Sure, Max, and then I'll tell you what I'd do.
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  Gold, silver, real estate, friends, family, storable foods, skills. Go ahead.
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:32.360]  Well, the problem is that the Ponzi scheme in paper is a Ponzi scheme, and you can't have any confidence in it.
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:43.360]  Whereas buying real assets, as we just talked about, whether it's gold, silver, Bitcoin, real estate, other real assets, it's a good position to be in.
[02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:47.360]  And we've said this many, many times, and that's still the case.
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  Yep, and so, caller, what do you think about that?
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:56.360]  I think that's a pretty good suggestion, and I think you should be handing out Pampers to those banksters.
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:58:03.360]  Yeah, no, I tell you, they've done what so many corrupt groups have done.
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:08.360]  They've overreached, and they're even getting rid of the due process that protected them.
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.360]  They really are crazy, aren't they, Max?
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:13.360]  Yeah, absolutely. It's a suicide mission.
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:19.360]  They are pathologically insane, and they're going to keep going and meet our cancer.
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:22.360]  So cancer will keep going until the host is destroyed.
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:28.360]  So these banksters will not stop until the host, that is to say the United States and the global economy, is destroyed.
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:30.360]  That's their goal.
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:33.360]  Unbelievable. Max, don't hang up. We'll do a few more minutes with you.
[02:58:33.360 --> 02:58:35.360]  For some more callers who've got questions, you can do that.

[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:36.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen. We've got Max Keiser on with us. Thank you for joining us.
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:40.360]  Ryan in Texas. You're on the air with Max Keiser. Go ahead.
[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:46.360]  Man, these phones are so bad, I can't understand a word you're saying, bud.
[03:00:46.360 --> 03:00:49.360]  Try to talk right into your phone, Ryan.
[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:54.360]  Oh hey, I had a question. One, Alex, we need to get you back on in Dallas.
[03:00:54.360 --> 03:01:06.360]  But two, Max, are we still looking at April for the little stock market bubble crash?
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:12.360]  And also, where do you see silver and gold going at that time because it's been down the last few months?
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:17.360]  Well, I'm claiming victory because everything against Bitcoin has crashed.
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:19.360]  So I'm claiming victory.
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:23.360]  As far as gold and silver, continue to see them as they have for the past 12 years.
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:26.360]  Every single one of the 12 years, they've gone up.
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:29.360]  So I'm looking for them to continue to go up.
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:32.360]  Okay, hope that answers your question, sir. God bless you.
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:36.360]  Our Dallas affiliate, after about two years carrying us with a huge listenership,
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:39.360]  changed formats to another format, and that happens.
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:42.360]  So many stations were wrong. We were number one in Orlando.
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:45.360]  Sold it. They turned to ESPN Sports.
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:49.360]  So ratings don't matter anymore, folks. It's important to support the broadcast.
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:52.360]  But we're gaining more affiliates than we lose, so that's the good news.
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:55.360]  Well, that's what happens when you have propaganda take over from commercial radio.
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:59.360]  They're more interested in the propaganda than because they get subsidies from the government,
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  which is more profitable than you're competing head-to-head in an open free market.
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:04.360]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:06.360]  ESPN is doing propaganda.
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:09.360]  I mean, I get number one ratings everywhere where I'm put on a decent station,
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:11.360]  even the little stations I can get the top ratings.
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:16.360]  I mean, I beat Rush Limbaugh in every demographic on a 10,000-watt station
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:20.360]  up against a 50,000-watt in Orlando.
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:25.360]  Yeah, but if you're Rush Limbaugh, you get a huge subsidy from the government to broadcast propaganda.
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:29.360]  He is basically the Tokyo Rose of America. He's a propagandist.
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:34.360]  He gets a huge government subsidy. He's a Nat Turner.
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:37.360]  How does he get a government subsidy?
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:42.360]  Well, he cuts a deal for $400 million, and the broadcaster that carries them, of course,
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.360]  is an entity that promises never to carry anything on his network
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:51.360]  that would anyone find offensive in any single way, so they give him huge licenses,
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:56.360]  and the government allows them to consolidate their media footprint.
[03:02:56.360 --> 03:03:00.360]  You know, there's very few broadcasters in America, but that's a subsidy.
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:02.360]  That's welfare from the government.
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:04.360]  Yeah, no, MSNBC definitely is.
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:06.360]  They can also watch Limbaugh on, and at the same time,
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:10.360]  they'll give you a $2 billion license fee for free.
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:13.360]  Just keep this idiot on saying stupid stuff all day long.
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:17.360]  That's a subsidy. He's a Tokyo Rose of America. The guy is a menace.
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:22.360]  Let's talk to Judy in Florida. Judy, you're on the air.
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:24.360]  Hi, Alex. It's Judy. Can you hear me?
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:27.360]  I can. Throw your question out, please.
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:30.360]  Sure. This is a serious one, too.
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:33.360]  This is the second time I've gotten to speak to Max. This is great.
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:38.360]  What about the prospect of what they're trying to put in Congress
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:44.360]  or through Congress through LaRouche Political Action Committee on Glass-Steagall?
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:48.360]  I mean, it's a great idea, but it never happens because the criminals run things, Max.
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:52.360]  Yeah, I agree. It never happens. Great idea, but it never happens.
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:58.360]  There is work to have it, you know, put through. There absolutely is.
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:00.360]  No, I know. I mean, I know there's groups working for that,
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:03.360]  but, I mean, my issue is the criminals are so consolidated,
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:06.360]  we've got to work at every level. That is the problem, though.
[03:04:06.360 --> 03:04:10.360]  The criminals basically can get away with anything. We're becoming North Korea.
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:13.360]  They're putting forward this guy who's extremely anti-banker.
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:17.360]  This, you know, comedian who's now front-running to be the president of the country,
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:18.360]  and he's taking on the banks.
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:22.360]  Now, I believe that if he does become any more successful in Italy,
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:26.360]  they're going to call up the John Perkins clone, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:29.360]  They're going to go down there, and they're going to give an ultimatum.
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:33.360]  Either you adopt the IMF or you're going to fall out of an airplane.
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:39.360]  That's right. Absolutely. Yeah, they're really scared of what's happening in Italy.
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:41.360]  Let me talk to you when we go to break here, Max.
