[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:31.720]  Texas Alex Jones thank you for joining us we are kicking off another global
[00:31.720 --> 00:38.020]  transmission against tyranny and another hour of worldwide broadcast it is
[00:38.020 --> 00:45.560]  Wednesday the ninth day of May 2012 thank you for joining us we've got big
[00:45.560 --> 00:53.080]  news obviously on the latest underwear bomber the crusty underwear bomber
[00:53.080 --> 01:00.880]  being a CIA double agent and they they thwarted it oh my gosh thank goodness
[01:00.880 --> 01:04.280]  turd-offs companies making billions with the naked body scanners and they're
[01:04.280 --> 01:09.640]  saying they need them worldwide because if anybody ever has an underwear bomb in
[01:09.640 --> 01:12.560]  a park you've got to have but naked body scanners to get in the park well
[01:12.560 --> 01:19.040]  actually that is happening in areas of England in the US so it's here if there's
[01:19.040 --> 01:24.120]  ever a threat anywhere there's got to be a big government that you pay money to
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.680]  to protect you but you're not allowed to protect yourself so we're gonna be
[01:29.680 --> 01:34.400]  breaking that down also that dovetails with this you know not only is Michael
[01:34.400 --> 01:40.280]  Savage banned from England but now UK banned self-defense expert from
[01:40.280 --> 01:45.320]  entering country government wants a nation of cowardly defenseless victims
[01:45.320 --> 01:48.560]  doesn't matter he doesn't have a criminal record doesn't matter he's an
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.040]  upstanding citizen former US Navy SEAL and self-defense instructor Tim Larkin
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.920]  Brits are getting upset about being robbed and raped and the rest of it is
[01:58.920 --> 02:05.000]  the crime rate spirals out of control and as they're fed on by the populations
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.360]  being brought in that see them as sheep because they've been trained to be sheep
[02:08.360 --> 02:11.800]  and they said look you're not allowed to come to England and teach hand-to-hand
[02:11.800 --> 02:16.100]  defense you don't defend yourself I've seen articles where a woman's being
[02:16.100 --> 02:19.400]  raped and stabbed somebody in her own home and they throw the book at her you
[02:19.400 --> 02:24.240]  go to prison you lay there and you take it that because the criminals in
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.200]  government want a domesticated population that article is so important
[02:29.200 --> 02:36.080]  and is at info wars.com Doug Hagman is going to be joining us he is a
[02:36.080 --> 02:41.640]  investigator and private detective and a founder of the director of the North
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.000]  East Intelligence Network and CEO of a multi-state licensed private
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.520]  investigative agency serving four to five hundred clients and he's got some
[02:51.520 --> 02:57.440]  amazing information that ties into all the martial law civil war preparations
[02:57.440 --> 03:03.960]  going on so look forward to having him on the broadcast in the second hour
[03:03.960 --> 03:13.000]  today also I've been planning on taking off a few days so I had Mike Adams in
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.080]  here Friday filling in but I but I I think I'm gonna be here tomorrow live
[03:20.080 --> 03:23.960]  just a just a footnote for everybody there as well I don't think I'm gonna go
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.800]  out of town okay that said I think I just made that decision right there
[03:27.800 --> 03:33.120]  there's just too much happening and too much too much going on here of course
[03:33.120 --> 03:42.760]  the big news the big kahuna is at info wars.com and we'll cover this first when
[03:42.760 --> 03:51.640]  we get back the army has responded and has said that the army did not intend
[03:51.640 --> 04:01.200]  that for public release and that indeed it is real but that it should not be
[04:01.200 --> 04:07.720]  public fm3-3940 the reeducation camp for the American people and your social
[04:07.720 --> 04:13.440]  security numbers and having your mouth gagged and political dissonance taken
[04:13.440 --> 04:17.440]  to the camp slave labor it's all in there of course the sioppers we could
[04:17.440 --> 04:21.440]  tell this was hardcore as soon as we publish it after we confirmed it was
[04:21.440 --> 04:26.080]  real last week it was authentic because they hit us within minutes they were
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.960]  standing by to say it wasn't real just like NDAA people off balance so that we
[04:30.960 --> 04:34.720]  couldn't form a resistance to it and then to put the idea that it wasn't real
[04:34.720 --> 04:42.360]  so later as it came out to be real that people say oh but it isn't real kind of
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.200]  like people say oh bush wasn't for the assault weapons ban even though he was
[04:45.200 --> 04:51.120]  or or bomb was against the NDAA even though he signed it so army
[04:51.120 --> 04:55.880]  administration camp manual not intended for public release gonna break that down
[04:55.880 --> 05:01.520]  and a lot more straight ahead in a lot of elections this is Alex Jones with five
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.760]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.560]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.560 --> 05:13.640]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.640 --> 05:17.880]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[05:17.880 --> 05:22.160]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.160]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.520]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[05:30.520 --> 05:34.280]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.400]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.400 --> 05:42.240]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[05:42.240 --> 05:45.720]  powered generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[07:31.920 --> 07:36.520]  lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[07:36.520 --> 07:40.680]  which is key save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches
[07:40.680 --> 07:44.520]  from the plastic propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there it's what
[07:44.520 --> 07:49.440]  my family uses info wars.com already has the lowest price on propure but if you

[08:19.920 --> 08:25.600]  we're live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this
[08:25.600 --> 08:32.640]  Wednesday 9th day of May 2012 we're gonna look at the evidence of
[08:32.640 --> 08:39.760]  preparation for civil war in the United States coming up in the second hour with
[08:39.760 --> 08:46.920]  Doug Hagman he's the founder director of the Northeast intelligence network and
[08:46.920 --> 08:49.760]  he's got a lot of very interesting intelligence that dovetails with our
[08:49.760 --> 08:56.920]  research so he's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour for his
[08:56.920 --> 09:04.240]  maiden visit with info wars and info wars.com let me just go over some of
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.640]  the headlines here congressional Democrats introduced amendment to outlaw
[09:08.640 --> 09:14.520]  self-defense that's what it is they're saying if somebody's charging you you've
[09:14.520 --> 09:19.440]  got to try to run away instead of dropping to one knee and pumping rounds
[09:19.440 --> 09:24.760]  into their chest if they're charging you with a gun or a meat-glaver and that's
[09:24.760 --> 09:28.600]  basically they understand the ground laws only state what was already on the
[09:28.600 --> 09:32.720]  common law books but the police were brainwashed that wasn't the case so they
[09:32.720 --> 09:39.320]  had to pass other laws just like TSA isn't legally lawfully allowed to stick
[09:39.320 --> 09:42.880]  their hands down your pants especially but even on the outside state and
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.120]  federal courts have said no that's that's sexual assault the Texas just
[09:46.120 --> 09:50.120]  didn't order the state police and others and local police to enforce the law
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.560]  they said we'll pass the unanimous law pointing out the other law that this is
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.440]  illegal and the fed said we'll blockade your state militarily Texas said all
[10:00.440 --> 10:03.400]  right our daughters and sons are yours start groping the pedophiles went and
[10:03.400 --> 10:08.160]  got jobs and said that's more like it scum and we said yes sir boss and they
[10:08.160 --> 10:12.160]  said all right get in the radiation baster as well because they also grop
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.240]  you after the radiation baster in most cases and there's more arrest of TSA for
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.600]  pedophilia and crimes coming out this week I mean that's just how they are and
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.240]  that's the kind of folks want to do that who wants that job but side issue
[10:26.240 --> 10:33.880]  congressional Democrats have introduced amendment to outlaw self-defense and no
[10:33.880 --> 10:37.000]  sooner had they done that there was a big backlash going wow you people are
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.760]  anti-gun that they're now claiming that they're gonna withdraw it that's out of
[10:40.760 --> 10:44.480]  the Washington Post today but here's the info wars comm story congressional
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.480]  Democrats introduced amendment to outlaw self-defense if you want to see what
[10:49.480 --> 10:53.480]  they're pushing in the type of plans they have for the American people and of
[10:53.480 --> 10:57.480]  course that'll be like England Paul Watson has a article on this will go
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.080]  over into tail later UK banned self-defense expert from entering the
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.200]  country just like I was banned from entering Canada until all the media
[11:06.200 --> 11:11.120]  showed up at Bilderberg in 06 and and then they released me but said watch it
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.120]  and they just said hey you don't teach self-defense in England that's
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.720]  basically illegal there's no law but the bureaucrats are king because they're a
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.840]  criminal class and they want to build a club you and taser you and beat you like
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.480]  at the G20 a few years ago and kill a guy delivering newspapers to a store that
[11:29.480 --> 11:32.800]  was in the area he didn't do anything at all came out of video they just beat him
[11:32.800 --> 11:36.520]  to death for fun you're not allowed to defend yourself because well the state
[11:36.520 --> 11:43.480]  is God and so self-defense expert and former US Navy SEAL Tim Larkin got some
[11:43.480 --> 11:49.080]  good techniques there those always just came to me as common sense from entering
[11:49.080 --> 11:54.320]  the country after Larkin plan to hold seminars instructing people how to
[11:54.320 --> 12:00.360]  protect themselves against rioters and criminals you don't do that in fact I
[12:00.360 --> 12:04.760]  saw footage we all saw it in England where people would be attacked by giant
[12:04.760 --> 12:07.600]  third-world hordes that came from very rough countries and they know how to
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.360]  attack people and the average Brit even with their wife or children would just
[12:11.360 --> 12:15.840]  lay there and take it wow and of course historically the Brits were not known for
[12:15.840 --> 12:20.480]  that I'm being particularly savage and vicious but this is total and absolute
[12:20.480 --> 12:24.560]  complete domestication and the police do it as well the military feeds on them
[12:24.560 --> 12:30.520]  and it's just an absolutely cowed cowardly pathetic group of jellyfish just
[12:30.520 --> 12:36.040]  like Americans are becoming I saw I've told you the cases of a lady choking in
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.680]  a restaurant I come out of the bathroom my wife's there with my son just like
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.520]  ten years nine years ago and the people started trying to stop me from doing the
[12:45.520 --> 12:50.600]  Heimlich they just kept chirping 9-1-1 we called 9-1-1 9-1-1 like it was their
[12:50.600 --> 12:58.840]  God 9-1-1 9-1-1 no no 9-1-1 are you trained are you she'd have been dead but
[12:58.840 --> 13:02.240]  you don't do that and again you pull up the cases where they're trying to outlaw
[13:02.240 --> 13:08.880]  knives even in your house they're trying to in England they're saying you can't
[13:08.880 --> 13:13.320]  even defend yourself when assaulted you defend yourself with your fist in your
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.560]  house they throw a fake book at you it's not even a law and you end up going to
[13:18.560 --> 13:24.800]  jail they call it assault in England if criminals hurt themselves in your house
[13:24.800 --> 13:30.400]  that you shoe you get soon get in trouble that's starting to happen here so
[13:30.400 --> 13:35.840]  this is the new thing here so we're gonna be going over that report in detail
[13:35.840 --> 13:42.440]  today as well along with the attack on self-defense here in the United States
[13:42.440 --> 13:46.360]  because the state wants the monopoly of the force because they're the higher
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.560]  level criminals and they love their little friends the low level criminals
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.200]  that's why they keep nonviolent people and marijuana offenders packing the
[13:53.200 --> 13:57.040]  prisons longer in many cases than armed robbers and aggravated assaulters
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.040]  because it's important to keep them out there terrorizing the public so they
[14:01.040 --> 14:05.640]  beg for more police state and even if the police do bust the criminals they just
[14:05.640 --> 14:11.640]  get released the violent offenders so that's that's how this system works
[14:11.640 --> 14:17.120]  we're also going to get into video CIA catches itself in new underwear bomber
[14:17.120 --> 14:22.080]  plot and I was watching ABC News this morning and they have all the reporters
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.600]  with fake satisfaction just like they won the lottery sitting there
[14:26.600 --> 14:31.480]  telegraphing into the audience going this is a stunning coup for Obama
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.520]  incredible precision this intelligence coup keeping a safe it just unbelievable
[14:36.520 --> 14:40.000]  and they all get this satisfied look and they cut back to Stephanophilus and
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.480]  they're just like this is so incredible how they keep it safe and it's so fake I
[14:45.480 --> 14:50.040]  mean think about it when you're unconscious people get into this and
[14:50.040 --> 14:56.480]  get into the condescending attitude I was in a restaurant this morning and they
[14:56.480 --> 15:00.200]  and they had it on and I was watching the waitress I was watching the men in
[15:00.200 --> 15:03.960]  there some construction workers they were going yeah good oh they had it turned
[15:03.960 --> 15:08.920]  up everybody was standing around feel a lot of pride right now we got them oh
[15:08.920 --> 15:17.480]  yeah we got the crusty underwear bomb oh it was a CIA double agent wow man we are
[15:17.480 --> 15:22.080]  good talk about pride hey Bob you hear about him paying 20 plus billion
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.640]  our tax money to ship the Cadillac and vault factories of China and Brazil yeah
[15:27.640 --> 15:32.720]  boy we're winning hey do you hear the cancer rates are exploding they put
[15:32.720 --> 15:36.080]  cancer viruses in the vaccines to take all the minerals out of food no I don't
[15:36.080 --> 15:42.040]  know about that I just know you turn on ABC News and they're just up there going
[15:42.040 --> 15:46.000]  just everybody smiling almost high-five and it was like ESPN
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.560]  covering the sudden death over time NFL game in your team just one you know
[15:51.560 --> 15:55.320]  there's gonna be some American flags made in China by slaves hanging out at
[15:55.320 --> 15:59.480]  the houses today they're gonna dust that little puppy off and get it out there
[15:59.480 --> 16:03.560]  and just look till you I'm feeling good right now because some enemies of this
[16:03.560 --> 16:09.320]  country got up there on TV and read off a teleprompter and acted all satisfied
[16:09.320 --> 16:18.800]  all this fake pride garbage I mean and it's a total and complete mirage and I'm
[16:18.800 --> 16:26.040]  gonna cover that first after I cover our top story since last Wednesday we have
[16:26.040 --> 16:33.360]  been beating the drum fierce over a Army manual that we confirmed from our
[16:33.360 --> 16:40.120]  sources was real and that was posted on the big public gov site that vets the
[16:40.120 --> 16:46.360]  documents the leaked documents and post them and sure enough the Army has now
[16:46.360 --> 16:51.240]  responded we have those communicates posted at info wars.com the actual
[16:51.240 --> 16:56.880]  email if you scroll down to the bottom of the article Army admits reeducation
[16:56.880 --> 17:03.000]  camp manual not intended for public release but then they run a customary
[17:03.000 --> 17:10.320]  psy op on you and say but this is for overseas the reeducation camps really
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.120]  I'm not for the criminals that run our government running a reeducation camps
[17:14.120 --> 17:18.080]  I thought that's what North Koreans do even overseas this is pure evil and they
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.640]  admit what do they do in these in fact John will you go grab me last night's
[17:21.640 --> 17:25.080]  news stack off the broadcast desk where I left it because I want to show them that
[17:25.080 --> 17:30.920]  London Guardian article and others where they admit at these al-Qaeda bases at
[17:30.920 --> 17:40.520]  these training bases fantastic at these at these training bases again I have a
[17:40.520 --> 17:45.800]  Freudian slip there at the al-Qaeda prison camps where the US doesn't exist
[17:45.800 --> 17:51.120]  anymore banker occupied are operating these these internment camps were so
[17:51.120 --> 17:55.440]  called al-Qaeda and Taliban are actually training grounds to produce the new al-Qaeda
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.880]  leadership to release them to actually go out and carry out attacks and
[17:59.880 --> 18:04.840]  organize new groups and see that came out with this underwear bomber got leaked
[18:04.840 --> 18:10.240]  a day and a half ago two days ago now and so they had to spend it and go he is
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.360]  a CIA asset but he's a double agent and then have all the talking heads get up
[18:15.360 --> 18:22.320]  on TV and act all official and act all powerful and get all excited so again I
[18:22.320 --> 18:30.760]  can't get into the army admitting their camp story their reeducation camp story
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.120]  without getting into the fact that that's what these reeducation camps are at
[18:35.120 --> 18:41.660]  Gitmo and at camp x-ray there at Gitmo and at Abu Ghraib and then the black
[18:41.660 --> 18:46.160]  sites where the real stuff goes on I mean where they got dungeon keeper hell
[18:46.160 --> 18:51.080]  spawn type stuff going on it is just so nightmarish it's off the chart I mean
[18:51.080 --> 18:54.560]  they admit they're taking people's brains out of their heads while they're
[18:54.560 --> 18:59.920]  awake you know letting them watch it you know with the eyeballs attached there
[18:59.920 --> 19:04.080]  they're stopping people's hearts with chemicals but then keeping them alive
[19:04.080 --> 19:09.200]  with oxygenators pumping into the blood they're they're using a puffer fish
[19:09.200 --> 19:15.480]  paralyzing systems on people they're raping kids it came out they they
[19:15.480 --> 19:19.640]  spray blood all over them and then have naked women dance around wearing devil
[19:19.640 --> 19:25.480]  devil outfits and they bring in menstruating prostitutes to rape the
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.640]  men while they're chained down totally freaking them out most of them they
[19:29.640 --> 19:33.200]  bring in or below the age of 14 that's come out in the news because they like
[19:33.200 --> 19:36.320]  to torture them for five six years and then release them after they're totally
[19:36.320 --> 19:40.920]  mind-controlled at camp x-ray they have a camp within it run by psychiatrists
[19:40.920 --> 19:44.120]  where they admit they're engaged in mind-control and creating mind-control
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.160]  assassins just like the psychiatrists they used out at Fort Hood they were
[19:48.160 --> 19:52.520]  controlling so that's a you think any that's a joke by the way go look it up

[33:59.600 --> 34:03.880]  world government being established it is the United States the once great
[34:03.880 --> 34:07.720]  republic being used as an engine of world government while the globalists
[34:07.720 --> 34:14.240]  destroy us from within at the same time the treason is full spectrum full
[34:14.240 --> 34:18.640]  spectrum treason that's a good way to describe this full spectrum assault on
[34:18.640 --> 34:24.400]  humanity crime against humanity crime against common-sense crime against
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.720]  goodness is what we're dealing with these are bad people that run this
[34:28.720 --> 34:36.120]  ugliness is beautiful to them it's just that the raw power is what they seek and
[34:36.120 --> 34:39.560]  there's never enough of it
[34:42.880 --> 34:48.600]  during the break do was showing me in the 327 page army reeducation camp
[34:48.600 --> 34:57.200]  document sections where it talks about engaging the militia and insurgent
[34:57.200 --> 35:01.080]  groups whether in a foreign country or here in the u.s. and processing the
[35:01.080 --> 35:06.120]  people whether social security numbers I have that on tape in police state 2000
[35:06.120 --> 35:11.960]  and here comes the public affairs officer that's the villain that was
[35:11.960 --> 35:17.080]  named Steve Jones freaking out going Jones get out of here yeah I told you
[35:17.080 --> 35:20.080]  you couldn't be in this area because every time he ran off with some other
[35:20.080 --> 35:25.800]  media I would sneak off with Mike Hansen in the video camera and he was getting
[35:25.800 --> 35:29.600]  so mad because he wanted to be able to say they were letting me film this stuff
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.120]  so they threw us out it didn't matter we had locals posing as citizens who would
[35:34.120 --> 35:38.640]  sit there mindlessly with the Marines and ask dumb questions and so they would
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.120]  let him sit there and watch the Marines train to kill militia members and throw
[35:43.120 --> 35:47.280]  them into pits which is standard procedure in Afghanistan that came out
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.880]  in the Ithaca Journal the member private gruckheimer came out and said yeah in
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.840]  certain villages we kill even the babies we kill everyone and the army came out
[35:55.840 --> 36:01.120]  and said now wait a minute we only do that sometimes yeah here it is in the
[36:01.120 --> 36:12.480]  section it's 117 1-17 section and it says members the armed forces of a party
[36:12.480 --> 36:16.960]  to the conflict and members of the militias or volunteer corps forming
[36:16.960 --> 36:20.120]  part of such armed forces members of other militias and members of other
[36:20.120 --> 36:24.280]  volunteer corps including those of organized resistance movements belonging
[36:24.280 --> 36:29.240]  to the party to the conflict and operating in or outside of our territory
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.000]  other own territory even in this territory is occupied provided that such
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.680]  militias or volunteer corps including such organized resistance movements
[36:37.680 --> 36:47.120]  fulfill the following conditions and it gets into their reeducation isn't that
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.720]  just special right there boy I tell you that this this document is a treasure
[36:52.720 --> 37:01.560]  trove of treason and I shot a video a few days ago talking about this and I was
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.480]  like this is an indictment this is a conviction this is isn't a manual and
[37:05.480 --> 37:09.920]  the top commenter this comment got up at the top he was like this isn't an army

[37:16.080 --> 37:18.760]  you can't think of the right words like a splinter in your mind you can't get it
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.680]  out you want to dig it out but there it is it was like yes that's the word this

[38:12.480 --> 38:17.400]  the globalist are attacking the United States while they use our energy while
[38:17.400 --> 38:22.880]  they suck us dry they're using our energy to power their new world order we're
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.160]  paying for our own destruction we're paying for the world's enslavement while
[38:28.160 --> 38:33.960]  our name is destroyed worldwide remember they they advertise this new world
[38:33.960 --> 38:40.920]  order as an American Empire when it's the opposite it's the end of America think
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.680]  about that we get the blame for everything we get destroyed politically
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.640]  financially spiritually we get hated worldwide and the same globalist
[38:50.640 --> 38:55.560]  overseas demonize us with their media systems but praise everything here and
[38:55.560 --> 39:00.720]  like we're the good guys and it's it's cartoon level propaganda when you're
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.360]  awake you watch this stuff and it's like this is like satire this is so
[39:06.360 --> 39:12.800]  ridiculous and if we don't wake up to America being hijacked if we don't
[39:12.800 --> 39:16.640]  wake up to the shadow government we can remove these puppet politicians all
[39:16.640 --> 39:20.280]  day and replace them with Mitt Romney or replace Romney with somebody it's not
[39:20.280 --> 39:24.120]  gonna be anything that is rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic you must wake
[39:24.120 --> 39:28.360]  up to the new world order that's why they're always it doesn't exist don't
[39:28.360 --> 39:31.840]  look into it never mind all the documents and presidents and the and the
[39:31.840 --> 39:34.320]  fact it's a world government a corporate fascist world government and the
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.760]  public documents that we're gonna shut your power off and destroy the family
[39:37.760 --> 39:41.640]  and deindustrialize you never mind all that it doesn't exist extremists talk
[39:41.640 --> 39:45.080]  about that the derivatives don't exist the bankers aren't gonna bankrupt
[39:45.080 --> 39:49.440]  anything no don't listen to the bad men don't listen to Alex Jones and Ron Paul
[39:49.440 --> 39:54.200]  and G. Edward Griffin all these countless others don't listen to them they're
[39:54.200 --> 40:00.240]  crazy remember 15 years ago 20 years ago doesn't exist now everything we said is
[40:00.240 --> 40:06.520]  manifesting our credibility is absolutely triple platinum and the
[40:06.520 --> 40:11.400]  globalists just don't care they're just going ahead with it because the plan is
[40:11.400 --> 40:16.720]  to create a civil war it will not hurt the new world order if you shoot US
[40:16.720 --> 40:21.040]  military forces coming to load you on a truck for processing all they know is
[40:21.040 --> 40:25.520]  they're picking up these people and of course you know the sicko torturers are
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.080]  back at the compound and all those young guys do rolling up to your house but
[40:30.080 --> 40:33.360]  then you don't have a choice you can't let them grab your kids and you and load
[40:33.360 --> 40:39.480]  them on that's the plan it's to run away trains collision course the average
[40:39.480 --> 40:44.080]  cops is told go pick this person up they send out the police to get them so
[40:44.080 --> 40:48.200]  you're destroyed if you do you're destroyed if you don't how about we all
[40:48.200 --> 40:52.080]  just wake up and like a brush fire in the minds of men and women this
[40:52.080 --> 40:57.560]  understanding spreads this awakening spreads and we say we have you in check
[40:57.560 --> 41:02.120]  now checkmate because this is a desperate gamble by the globalist
[41:02.120 --> 41:07.880]  everything's on the line in this they either get everything or fall forever
[41:07.880 --> 41:12.280]  because they have uncloak themselves now this thing is moving into gear
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.880]  they're they're attempting to get the police and military trained for this and
[41:15.880 --> 41:19.800]  the police and military if we wouldn't have warned them over the last patriots
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.680]  50 years most of them would go along with the official story but because
[41:23.680 --> 41:28.720]  patriots mainly military and intelligence people who were hearing all
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.120]  this in the 50s and 60s and seeing it internally they leaked information a lot
[41:33.120 --> 41:37.960]  of them got killed imprisoned congressmen got set up a lot of stuff
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.600]  happened a lot of people got killed folks early on people ask how am I still alive
[41:42.600 --> 41:46.480]  early on they would kill people for this information or destroy them or put them
[41:46.480 --> 41:50.560]  in prison but that didn't work because the people had courage and just kept
[41:50.560 --> 41:55.000]  getting the emergency signal out so enough of us in the next generation the
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.440]  next wave which I'm one of the first of the last big generation of awakening now
[41:59.440 --> 42:03.560]  the mega generation is firing up and waking up and taking the blinders off
[42:03.560 --> 42:06.440]  right now and that's where the globalists are putting it in high gear
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.680]  against us they can see what's happening you see each wave and force
[42:10.680 --> 42:16.920]  multiplication we replicate a much larger group and we're now entering I just
[42:16.920 --> 42:26.960]  got chills biggest ones ever we just saw a gigantic look at that I've got I've
[42:26.960 --> 42:33.920]  got goosebumps right now because I can see it in my mind so I can see a 3D
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.640]  model of this fight and I know we've got a good chance of beating these people if
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.640]  we're aggressive in our attack strategy in the info war if we don't back down and
[42:42.640 --> 42:46.520]  if we take fear and just you know what throw it into a bottomless pit fear
[42:46.520 --> 42:52.800]  you're gone baby oh that feels good yeah now you can think clear because you're
[42:52.800 --> 42:56.240]  not afraid doesn't mean you're not focused doesn't mean you don't have a
[42:56.240 --> 43:02.480]  dremel but it becomes fun because we were born to face the new world order the
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.600]  fact that you're a listener of the show and an activist the fact that you woke
[43:06.600 --> 43:15.560]  up before other people did that is your greatest possession think about that you
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.280]  are awake despite the chemical attack the psychological attack the biological
[43:20.280 --> 43:26.160]  attack the the spiritual attacks the cultural brainwashing all of it you
[43:26.160 --> 43:31.320]  defeated reeducation Camp America with people not even talking to their
[43:31.320 --> 43:35.000]  neighbors just watching TV in their little reeducation pods you drive down
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.400]  neighborhoods now at night the windows are glowing blue the television flicker
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.800]  now there's movements people disconnecting it's it's it's it's happening
[43:44.800 --> 43:53.200]  and as the fruits of the new world order come into place and we've been there
[43:53.200 --> 43:56.360]  the whole time explaining the new world order are the ones that did this and are
[43:56.360 --> 44:03.160]  going to do what's coming next they're gonna get the blame instead of us and so
[44:03.160 --> 44:11.160]  it's called being too late oh it's gonna be an incredible fight and it's up to
[44:11.160 --> 44:16.920]  you and how hard you take action how hard you pray on how long it takes to
[44:16.920 --> 44:21.520]  beat these people but it's gonna be rough make no mistake we're we're taking
[44:21.520 --> 44:24.400]  the plunge right now this is just the beginning it's gonna go faster and
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.880]  faster and faster from here on out this is world government new world order and
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.320]  if the devil isn't real he might as well be because these people act just like
[44:33.320 --> 44:38.440]  the most horrid devil I could imagine and so it's toe-to-toe with the devil and
[44:38.440 --> 44:46.000]  all his minions and it's the real deal the real deal you got front row seats
[44:46.000 --> 44:51.320]  ladies and gentlemen to open world government run by exterminist eugenicist
[44:51.320 --> 45:00.240]  Hitler was just a little aberrant spinoff of these people in their view because
[45:00.240 --> 45:07.200]  he was raised specific their full spectrum death they like all flavors of
[45:07.200 --> 45:12.960]  it they'll drink out any fetid stinking pond the more horrible the more full of
[45:12.960 --> 45:17.840]  dead innocence the better they're drunk on that blood like the Bible says drunk
[45:17.840 --> 45:23.160]  on the blood of the saints the innocence drunk they're drunk on blood you know
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.040]  why they're so arrogant they're killing people worldwide vaccinating people

[45:33.080 --> 45:38.600]  death 46 plus thousand on record giving paralysis after the polio shots last
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.320]  year alone in India and that's just a footnote in the news like it's a good
[45:43.320 --> 45:48.040]  thing they're so drunk on blood and but even better drunk on the wounded
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.760]  children paralyzed in those beds oh man that's beautiful of them and they're so
[45:53.760 --> 45:58.040]  drunk on that they're so arrogant on that they're like yeah we got reeducation

[48:08.040 --> 48:12.000]  release the document is intended for operations outside of the continental
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.400]  United States depending on the nature and magnitude of the event will determine
[48:17.400 --> 48:20.760]  the level of US military involvement any other questions regarding the
[48:20.760 --> 48:25.200]  document you will need to file a Freedom of Information Act request please let me
[48:25.200 --> 48:29.160]  know if you have any other questions well Tiffany we have questions we have more
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.600]  than 30 spots in there where it says social security numbers processing US
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.720]  citizens into this and that's on record so so I did you read it or did somebody
[48:38.720 --> 48:47.040]  just tell you that this was the case is that what happened so I just love how
[48:47.040 --> 48:54.160]  there's the customary deception in there army admits reeducation camp manual
[48:54.160 --> 48:59.560]  not intended for public release public affairs director falsely claims document
[48:59.560 --> 49:02.920]  is not applied to US citizens Fort Leonard Wood public affairs director
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.280]  Tiffany Wood has provided the first official response to the shocking US
[49:07.280 --> 49:11.080]  Army document that outlines the implementation of reeducation camps
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.320]  admitting that the manual was not intended for public release and claiming
[49:15.320 --> 49:20.160]  that its provisions only apply outside of the United States a contention
[49:20.160 --> 49:28.400]  completely disproved by the language contained in the document itself after
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.600]  a reader sent wood a link to where the manual entitled FM 3-39 dot 40 interment
[49:34.600 --> 49:38.160]  and resettlement operations can be downloaded at the army dot mill website
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.720]  but only by military employees with special credentials meaning that they
[49:42.720 --> 49:45.920]  believe their anti-america and their psychological profile or anti-freedom for
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.480]  that matter they'd be good North Korean soldiers would responded by stating the
[49:50.480 --> 49:53.720]  document should not be in the public domain the document was not intended for
[49:53.720 --> 49:57.480]  public release said would adding any other questions regarding the document
[49:57.480 --> 50:02.840]  you'll need a foyer request that means the either hackers have obtained access
[50:02.840 --> 50:06.240]  to secure military website and downloaded the manual or it was leaked by
[50:06.240 --> 50:09.880]  military employee concerned about the content of the document or they just
[50:09.880 --> 50:13.080]  want to throw it everybody's face try to scare people I sure you'll have the

[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:49.920]  everybody knows and years go by like weeks basically to be technical it's
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.240]  just amazing but I saw this article we are preparing for mass civil wars as DHS
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:02.040]  informant and I saw that and then you know read some other reports coming out
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:08.680]  from Mr. Hagman I wanted to get him on to break this down for us and tell us
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:15.360]  what his sources are telling him I mean we obviously see 450 million 40 cal
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.120]  bullets being bought hundreds of millions of others agencies that shouldn't
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.000]  even be armed getting riot shotguns police stations being hardened in
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.600]  government documents ahead of chivalron rest the military's training even

[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:41.600]  everywhere to acclimate and then you have the NDAA signal disappears citizens
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.080]  we have this new FEMA camp reeducation camp document that the army now confirms
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.520]  today is real yeah folks it's real okay and we have army sources that said yeah
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:55.320]  it's in there it says it's classified but then we had people calling up saying
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.920]  well it's actually posted here yeah if you had the classification to log in and
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.400]  get it so all of that's going on Doug tell us about your website a little bit
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.120]  and how folks go to that and then tell us about yourself and then you're

[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.840]  taking place in our case behind FEMA region 3 we'll say we're deep inside
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.720]  FEMA region 3 but they educate the population as to what's taking place
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.520]  with respect to our government which is just totally gone berserk now I mean we
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.240]  have Alex everything that you have said in your programs over the last several
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.920]  years since I've started listening has come to pass when people were calling
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.440]  you crazy for for what you were saying and people were saying now you know it
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.920]  can't be it's it's coming to pass right now we're seeing it we're verifying it
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.000]  we've got people talking to us saying hey listen to Alex listen to what Alex is
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.440]  saying and people coming to us saying look we've got information for you and
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.880]  here it is and here's what's taking place what's taking place is the United
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.200]  States government the Department of Homeland Security is turning inward on
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.960]  the American people they are declaring war on the American people and and and
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.800]  that's that's what it is Alex that's exactly what it is you know people
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:59.240]  wonder why the NDA was passed people wonder why you know the the various
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:04.400]  executive orders were were passed people wonder why the ammunition was
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.440]  purchased the people of the Tennessee look at things in vacuums but when you
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:12.480]  start connecting the dots you can see was taking place mobile armored pill
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:17.680]  boxes yes yes and and you've pointed this out and you've been at the tip of
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.480]  the spear pointing this out and and I gotta tell you frankly okay as an
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.880]  investigator for 27 years I've had a lot of doubts I had a lot of doubts about
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.240]  the the legitimacy of this information and I fell for that right left paradigm
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.160]  that's fictitious right left paradigm now I've seen look the that it's all
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.960]  been a farce it's it's first of all TSA is nothing more than you know security
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:50.000]  theater at this point we are living in an Orwellian dream at this point and
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.680]  then this is nothing to do with nothing to do about security everything to do
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.560]  about control of the American populace and conditioning of the American
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.800]  populace everything you've been talking about in your program this is coming to
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.760]  pass amazing and I mean thank you for supporting the broadcast I just ran
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.080]  into the information firsthand by going to some drills 15 16 years ago and
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:13.080]  discovered all this but getting into all of your contacts because you brought
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.280]  out a lot of amazing information on a routine basis what are your contacts
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.520]  telling you now about the acceleration of all of this I've got one contact in
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.560]  particular that I've that I've been in contact with I've known since 1979 good
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.140]  friend of mine I'll leave it at that he works well he works very close to the
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:35.880]  what he works within the complex of the DHS under the umbrella of the DHS let's
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.680]  put it that way and and he's aware of information that is been developing
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:45.840]  over the last we'll say two years but has been accelerating over the last
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.120]  several months to the extent that what Obama is planning on doing I mean
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.840]  Obama can see the writing of the wall there's dissatisfaction there's
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.280]  unemployment there's people that are going hungry in this country there's
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.760]  there's civil discord all of this is taking place you can see the writing of
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.720]  the wall it doesn't look good for his election but these people have no plans
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.320]  on leaving Alex and I'm telling you right now the people who ride it in the
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:15.800]  1960s the Bill Ayers and the Bernie Dorns who were actually the protesters
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.800]  in the 60s and early 70s the weather underground these are the people whose
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.400]  Obama has by his side right now these are the people who are my source are
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.840]  saying look what what these people are doing for example Trayvon Martin they're
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:34.600]  using this as a catalyst for racial unrest the NBC edited the tape to make it
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:40.480]  sound racist and the Justice Department got caught with moles fomenting the new
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.600]  black Panthers and people I mean they really are trying to get a race for
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.840]  exactly they are and they're they're they're working toward that goal but
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.040]  they're also looking toward the economic factors and this is something that's so
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.400]  important that people really need to understand what's going on in Europe
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:02.240]  right now today is coming to America we're facing this massive hyperinflation
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.000]  or this massive economic collapse in this country I mean your guest Gerald
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.760]  Salenti right on the money with his information it's kind of this is coming
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.120]  to America and I'll tell you what DHS knows this that they know that they can't
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.080]  stop this they know that the dollar is going to collapse they know that because
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.000]  of this there's going to be class warfare and that's the other leg of the
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.800]  table and so when you have the racial component combined with the economic
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.640]  component the class warfare I'm gonna tell you they're expecting riots
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:38.200]  they're expecting it not only expecting it but they're seeding it the they're
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.400]  actually seeding it for example they've got my my sources telling me according to
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.360]  the information that he's found for example Lewis Farrakhan and others now
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:51.240]  he would not name others but others are on the payroll of the CIA this is what
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.480]  my sources saying allegedly okay allegedly Farrakhan is on the payroll of
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:03.680]  CIA why for what purpose well to enhance and to facilitate these discord the
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.720]  racial discord in this country that's what's taking place but they know they
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.200]  can't stop the collapse of the dollar Obama Bernanke working together to tank
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.720]  the dollar the US dollar on purpose I mean they are they are destroying this
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.480]  country and they're not going to leave until they're done well when they say
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.960]  when I say destroying the country they're fundamentally changing the country of
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.880]  course in the words of Obama changing it to a to a Marxist society which is
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.880]  destroying the country exactly exactly it's just you know and in my sources
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.560]  telling me this look in 1965 the Watts riots 34 dead thousand injured in 68
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:46.120]  the 68 riots I guess we had I don't know if we're close to 100 dead in the
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:51.960]  Rodney King riots we had 53 dead one billion dollars in property damage the
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.960]  riots that are coming this summer that are expected this summer that are going
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.200]  to be enhanced by the actions of the government this summer and you pointed
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.520]  a lot of this stuff out people have to people need to listen to you very
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:08.480]  carefully because you put a little lot of facts out but it's amazing now
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.040]  that they're gonna pale in comparison to what's coming this summer if the
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.880]  timetable is correct and we've always heard this in bad economic times but
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:24.400]  the murders and the racial attacks and the craziness and people on edge it is
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.640]  I'm seeing it everywhere and I live in the wealthiest per capita city rated by
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:35.600]  Forbes Austin and it's already bad here I can't imagine southern California
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:41.240]  Michigan places like that it Florida I mean it's gonna be a powder keg indeed
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.320]  it is and that's what they're counting on and you know again this whole thing
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.920]  it is is is coming it's gonna come like a tsunami it's gonna hit us like a ton
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.120]  of bricks there's a lot of people you've woken up a lot of people Alex and
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.160]  thank you for that and but there are a lot of people who just have no clue no
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.600]  idea and one thing my source did tell me that I was very concerned about is the
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.680]  fact that you know of course we all know about the FEMA camps that don't exist of
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:14.720]  course they do their disaster relief centers according to you know their
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.280]  names people when they get hungry and they're unprepared they're gonna flock
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.880]  to these camps and in fact there's a book called how to kill 11 million people
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:31.440]  and and the details 67 pages long I don't I can't remember who wrote it but
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.360]  but the bottom line is this stay there I want to hear about your source on the
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:39.280]  FEMA camps exactly they implode society like the communist always say by design
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:44.480]  to then rebuild it and again the mega banks want the communism to destroy the
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.360]  republic to then bring in their new system of control but that's exactly
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.360]  what we're talking about here and they are really attempting to set this off
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.760]  we'll get the FEMA camp information from our guest source on the other side

[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.440]  fooled and it's called fake TV fake TV is a low-cost small electronic security
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.360]  device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV when you go on summer
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:20.360]  vacation yes get rid of the obvious signs you're away by stopping the mail in the
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:25.080]  paper but go a step further and fooling crooks with fake TV at only 34.95
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:31.520]  what that can't be right yes for only 34.95 fake TV could be the difference
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.320]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked and all your
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.720]  possessions gone fake TV simulates the light from a real TV and can be programmed
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:44.520]  just like a lamp on a timer use fake TV in any room for just 34.95 and get
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:51.240]  additional fake TVs for only 29.95 go to fake TV calm or call 1-877-5 fake TV

[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:27.760]  HomelandSecurityUS.com is the website Northeast Intelligence Network CEO Doug
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.480]  Hagman all right now this is a short segment long segment coming up but get
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.080]  into the preparations what your sources are telling you you were getting into
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.200]  the FEMA camps which they admit in the emergency centers establishment act
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.440]  will be the new community they implode things pay to ship the jobs over cities
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.600]  people flood in then there's got to be a prison area for troublemakers in the
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.760]  community protesters and people and that's the sub camp areas so that's how
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.200]  they're gonna roll these out we already see it in California another is where
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:01.720]  they locked the homeless up at night but let's continue breaking down what your
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:07.120]  source told you well according to my source and he said look that the DHS
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.960]  brass they know this is coming there's no stopping it and it's going to be a
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:16.360]  lot easier if possible to have these people have people in general masses
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.440]  willingly go to these disaster relief centers for their food because you're
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.280]  not going to be able to buy food you're not going to be able to do any banking
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.080]  you're not going to be able to I mean we're gonna be into things are going to
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:31.120]  be in gridlock and when people get hungry they get desperate so they're
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.080]  gonna go do what the government tells them to do if there's food at these
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:40.280]  disaster relief centers great there so they're counting on a lot of people to
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.320]  respond appropriately to go to these centers for the food and then in phase
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.440]  one the camps will be our saviors phase to take the politicals but I'm sorry
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.080]  to please continue no I mean you're exactly right and then now you've been
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:59.080]  you've been running during your program the in 1982 documentary with Larry
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.440]  Graftwell saying well there's gonna be this mass extermination of people
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:06.960]  ultimately that's their plan there and people are like that you know there's
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.000]  normalcy biases taking them over and again I 27 years as an investigator I'm a
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.320]  hard sell on this kind of stuff I'm thinking wait a minute this can't be
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.920]  happening but it is happening everything you've said is true that what
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.600]  they're saying is okay once these people you know once we have them separated
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:26.440]  and those who don't go there will be mass arrests they'll be treated
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.880]  differently if they if they're taken anywhere at all if they're not dropped
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.680]  at the end of the driveway and the bottom line is then they're going you
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.880]  know gonna have control of everything and but but but but here that the here's
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.800]  the key real quickly here's the key Obama does not want to relinquish power
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.040]  Valerie Valerie Jarrett does not want to really relinquish power cast Sunstein all
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:49.880]  these people all these unappointed czars don't want to relinquish power at
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.480]  all and don't plan on it so they're planning on this economic collapse this
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:27:01.040]  racial divide this economic chaos panic riots and so on and so forth as a
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.820]  pretext to potentially suspend the elections we've already seen the
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:10.360]  trial balloon with governor Susan Purdue I believe her name is out of one of the
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.320]  Carolinas talking about suspending congressional elections they've had their
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.800]  eye on that they they're they're looking at that according to my source saying
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:22.160]  well what was the reaction could this possibly be indeed but this is what they
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.240]  want to do they want to stay in power one way or another and Obama knows that
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.600]  his numbers aren't good Obama knows that satisfaction is bad but he but again
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.480]  he did that and one of the with the thing that my source did say and he's
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:41.760]  experiencing in profiling by the way the forensic profiling he says does this
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:47.400]  look like a man who expects to be going anywhere after after this election of
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.840]  course not I mean look at the lavage lavage vacations that they're taking
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:55.480]  look at the way he's spending money I mean five trillion dollars he's added to
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.400]  the debt it's just incredible so we can see this coming according to my source
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.400]  DHS is aware of this and not stopping it instead of not stopping it they're
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.720]  facilitating it and by the way I was told this a year ago by sources and then
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.240]  now it's been in the news that they gave them what three billion dollars
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.720]  additional funding to set up TSA all over the country from the beta test they
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:23.400]  had going in 10 states at the time and now we've confirmed through other
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:29.120]  sources that these big armored lockers with the riot gear the weapons are being
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.200]  delivered and they're being cashed I've talked to military these giant
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.320]  processions of Bradley fighting vehicles freshly painted and ready for the
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.640]  US are being cashed at secondary armories because the systems afraid the
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:48.280]  public may take the regular armories I've talked to military that whenever
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.920]  Texas was about to throw the TSA out which the feds know is their vanguard
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:56.480]  takeover arm that will expand out on the streets their little administrative
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:03.000]  tattletale squad that on top of that that the military was standing by to
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.640]  invade Texas and then it came out they were going to have a blockade of the
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.880]  airways I mean this is already happening they're already geared up and
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:17.160]  people don't understand this you're exactly right I mean and then we look
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.200]  at the the attempts to control the internet act the CISPA you know SOPA
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:27.720]  and so on PIPA look this is all about control and specific control and I
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:33.760]  understand we're up against it stay there wow but can we expose this and have
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.720]  them back off as the question we'll be right back with our guest Doug Hagman

[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:49.240]  this is repeating itself and government doesn't care anymore government
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.560]  doesn't care if Corzine steals billions before anybody would have gotten in
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.520]  trouble they don't care if hang grenades get shipped to
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.800]  mexico when they get caught nobody gets in trouble
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:05.320]  they don't care on any fronts anymore and they come on go yeah we're torturing
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:09.640]  people yeah we'll secretly arrest you the ci director comes out and says yeah
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.960]  we're listening to everybody without warrants folks it's illegal for the ci
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:18.280]  to even operate domestically much less be saying yeah we spy on you at a public
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.720]  tech conference and laughing about it and saying all your appliances
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.320]  you're paying for new tech and i'm to track you in the smart meters ha ha
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.600]  you know five years ago the smart meters won't control your house oh yeah
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:34.040]  we're going to control your temperature and it spies on you now shut up
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:39.080]  this is an attempt like a pimp breaks a young prostitute to literally break our
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.800]  will i don't think it's working in fact i know it's not
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.800]  i mean the previous record was like two million guns sold in one month
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.200]  uh what was that three and a half years ago when obama was first getting in now
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:52.840]  i've saw a number of five million in one month
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:56.440]  uh three of the major manufacturers have said we can't sell guns one for six
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.520]  months one for a year they're that backordered
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.160]  i mean all of this is going on most the military i talked to her awake a lot
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:08.840]  of the police and that's what's happening because people before me i don't
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.360]  need any thanks is is doug's thanking me
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.720]  others saw this from the inside and talked about it i mean i heard people 20
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:18.600]  years ago when i was first waking up saying there's plans to bring in foreign
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.280]  troops and i'm like admiral yama motto said that there'd be a
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.280]  somebody with a rifle behind every blade of grass the japanese do that but not
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.840]  if it's posing as our own government and and responding to a stage crisis like
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:35.080]  economic or nuclear or biological and then there's all these white house
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.440]  memos by shapiro and others saying mr president a new
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.560]  oklahoma city or 911 will help us take over and then other memos even that
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:46.840]  even glenn bet covered by the way that's what got him fired was when he said
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.800]  they're planning and pointed obama a new oklahoma city
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.360]  fox is like bet you're off the air that's it get out of here
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.280]  and i had that from fox sources boy that caused a big uh furor when i had those
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.120]  sources and now i don't have one of those sources i have some other sources
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.800]  though the point is that that there is an
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.320]  attempt they're thinking about doing this but
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.880]  it's a catch 22 if we expose them they get scared because they're criminals and
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.920]  want to carry it out but if we don't expose them they
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.960]  go ahead and do it so then why don't we expose it because at least people are
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.720]  awake at least we know they're coming to our house
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.040]  and i mean that literally and figuratively they would like to have this
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:30.920]  implosion they would like to have this race war but the trayvon
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.680]  martin thing didn't go the way they wanted i think they're going with a
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:37.400]  model they use in the soviet union other areas
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.080]  i don't think it's going to work i don't think it's going to work
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:44.600]  now if they launch a war people tend to get patriotic
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.480]  and think that a war's patriotic get behind that and kind of shut up and go
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.080]  along with it but the plans to go around arrest political
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.760]  dissidents and people that they think are leaders across the political
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.720]  spectrum that is going to result in massive resistance
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.480]  and again i'm not some macho guy that's like let's just have a war with the
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:06.920]  military and police i know by the way they're going to lose that war
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:11.400]  but they're meant to you see and then i see in leo nine all these
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.920]  washed in post and admitting oh foreign troops are going to help fight american
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:18.840]  terrorist and uprisings that's now in hundreds of publications
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.360]  so it's gone for being a secret program in training videos we got
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:27.000]  from cooperative nugget 93 95 96 and urban warfare drills i went to after
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.960]  that and generals announcing you're the forces of
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.040]  the new world order and training in mock us towns i had to go see this myself
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:37.480]  and went and in some cases had to infiltrate
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:40.120]  you know i'm not going to get it all of it but
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.720]  well you've seen the footage the point is to show you this information
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.160]  so i knew there was a program under clinton to do this
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:51.480]  but now it is going into an operational phase is my point and i know i'm
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:54.280]  ranting dug we've got time i'll keep a little bit of the next hour because i'm
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.480]  taking away from in here but please don't thank me anymore just
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.320]  break down what your intel is how all these dots connect
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.600]  and then i'm going to give the number out 800 25 9
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:10.760]  92 31 800 25 9 9 2 3 1 give us more of what your sources i know you have a lot
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:14.840]  of them what else they're telling you on multi fronts but you were getting into
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.960]  how they plan to roll this out what about that question
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.880]  will we be able if we expose this enough
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.560]  to to cause them to not be able to implement this
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.200]  great question that's the only reason my source came to me with this information
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.640]  and said look get the word out there because if we don't
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.800]  if we don't do anything then it it's almost a done deal but if we can start
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.800]  talking about it start exposing it perhaps they will
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:46.280]  take a step backward and what we talked about and this is extremely important
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.360]  what my source made sure that you wanted me to
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:55.800]  mention this uh you actually recall the Thanksgiving 2010
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.920]  and 2009 when uh when they are to 2010 i believe it
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:05.480]  was when the TSA uh stood down with the body
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.160]  scanners uh because of the opt-out day the protest
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.640]  November 2010 yes sir okay now they they look at that
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:18.920]  and and that bothered them tremendously there were multiple meetings about this
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:23.080]  and i'm telling you your program caught in your exposure caused them to step
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.520]  step back and and and and do this and rush to
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.360]  exactly well well here's the thing this uh the whole tsa
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:34.360]  security theater and this is what people need to understand
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.960]  uh if the average american will put up with being sexually
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.760]  groped and nuked at an airport or just to travel or get going to a mall or a
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:46.440]  stadium or just to fly they'll accept almost anything
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:51.000]  that is their mindset and that's why that had such an
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.440]  adverse effect on them and sort of sort of send them back
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:59.880]  in time uh they didn't expect a reaction uh they expected everyone to be
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.600]  groped dopes to this point now now that that it's again the
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.720]  conditioning has has has made everyone groped dopes and
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.160]  according to my source they're saying okay now that we got people back in line
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.560]  and people back accepting the fact that they've got to be sexually molested
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.840]  now we can go forward okay now so again if everyone stood up and said no we're
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.080]  not going to submit we're not going to comply
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.560]  that would certainly set their timetable back but that was one particular
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:32.520]  point in time when when the dhs brass pistole in particular
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:36.840]  being the head of the tsa was absolutely outraged according to the
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.440]  information we have uh and this came from someone who was very close but
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.560]  pistole at the time if you'll let somebody grab your wife's breast and
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:46.920]  your genitals and molest your children and laugh at you and pull them aside while
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.000]  they cry which the i mean i've seen it myself they get off on it
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.280]  if you'll put up with that you'll let them come to your house and search and set
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:57.240]  up a checkpoint and take you away and that's what this is
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:02.920]  is prisoner training exactly yeah it's all of this has nothing to do with with
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:05.720]  again with security or it's all about conditioning
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:09.480]  it's all about getting people comfortable with seeing the the as you
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.840]  point out the troops in the streets with the with the black mask and
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.760]  and then the uh param paramilitary rifles and gear and what have you
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.800]  uh look none of this is law enforcement it's it's paramilitary and that's it
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.920]  we are supposed to be uh it's what what my source is saying
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.680]  they are they are doing this in incremental stages in order for us to be
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:33.960]  conditioned to see this across the country well that's the thing you can see
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:38.200]  the rollout you know it's a pr campaign and for somebody who's watching and
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:43.960]  knows it's ridiculous and it's a hundred percent being done in a wicked
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.480]  evil fashion i mean this is a premeditated
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:53.480]  total soft martial law rollout exactly now i want to say one thing
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:57.320]  you mentioned something about trayvon martin according to my source that
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.480]  trayvon martin case there was a lot of exculpatory evidence that was
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.800]  emitted from the affidavits the affidavit was written in a passive
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.560]  voice uh there were a lot of problems there's overcharging there there's
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:13.080]  potential uh prosecutorial misconduct by angela
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.480]  quarry alleged uh with respect to subordinate perjury
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.200]  and what have you and this is done uh at the by the good graces
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:28.360]  and with the approval and and uh with the approval of uh
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.560]  eric holder i mean this is the her she's taking her marches
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:35.000]  marching orders directly from eric holder so the outcome of
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.600]  whether this whether it's an acquittal of the Zimmerman in the trayvon martin
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:42.440]  case where there's something lesser i mean they overcharged Zimmerman
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:47.000]  and and and they were told to do that basically throwing
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.680]  attempting to throw the verdict to assure
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:55.240]  the uh the outrage when Zimmerman walks and they expect him to walk
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.240]  i'm not sure if i made that point clear and then they can control the trial
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:03.400]  so they can trigger that when they want as the pretext for the race riots
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.000]  exactly that's a you got it right on the money and and that's what my source is
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.120]  telling me and he said look don't underestimate
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:14.040]  the outcome either way of the Zimmerman uh situation
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.320]  now it's my understanding too and i just got this yesterday
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.760]  that the family of Zimmerman there's some things going on in the background
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.000]  with this i don't know if his family's been
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.440]  threatened i mean obviously you know they've been threatened but
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:32.440]  um in terms of you know no matter what happens you just keep your mouth shut
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:37.000]  to the family that is so there's something not right there
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.480]  okay uh that's that's that uh the uh i'm just trying to think here uh
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:47.160]  i lost my train of thought but uh you get where we're going with this i mean
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:52.440]  it's a really it's it's a three-legged stool and in the middle of this is this
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:58.360]  and the other thing too uh alex is everyone knows because 535 congressman
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:01.640]  and senators you know they seated power to the 13 people
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:06.760]  why did they do that you know why are more people saying hey wait a minute
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.760]  this is unconstitutional we heard uh judge napolitano talk about this
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.120]  but the very people who are affected by it aren't talking what's going on with
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.200]  that well according to my source look there are active threats everywhere
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.760]  uh remember the in my source told me that see remember the fbi files from the
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.040]  clinton years what do you think was in those i mean there was a lot of
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.360]  information and just the files that we know about there was more files taken
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.120]  by the clinton's the clinton's by the way never have never seated power in
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:38.440]  washington they are still in power to this day they're still in power and
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:41.960]  still calling the shots but they're part of the global globalist oligarchy
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.320]  that are that are behind the puppet master and obama and everyone knows a
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.600]  bomb by the way is illegitimate he is not
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.600]  uh constitutionally eligible and people try to trivialize that well they
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.320]  shouldn't because it's not really about a piece of paper about birth certificate
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:59.960]  it's about allegiance who is this guy well let me expand on that we've got
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.720]  the super committee you're talking about with 12 members of congress and the
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:06.440]  president you've got the president saying i've
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:09.320]  got the un to launch war you've got the joint chiefs of
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.440]  staff telling congress when they're at question that no we take our orders from
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.880]  the un now unbelievable treason with a capital t
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:18.920]  i mean it is even strong enough word it's so naked
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:22.120]  we've got governor's councils running things we've got
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:26.040]  rural councils we're gonna ban kids doing chores
[01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.880]  i mean they are moving on every front in an attempt
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.040]  to overwhelm people what are your other sources saying
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.320]  what else should we be looking at i mean why is congress
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:41.720]  why is congress just handing everything over and letting the military come in
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.440]  and and and really act like eddie haskels and be very arrogant towards them
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:52.280]  well look uh i do know that there are a lot of uh congress people according to
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.400]  my sources who have got a lot of skeletons in the
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.640]  closet and uh now they're pretty big skeletons too
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.840]  okay and of course they know that if they go against the grain
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:07.320]  as well of the of the so-called establishment party
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:11.080]  or their uh you know uh their higher ups of course there's going to be
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.920]  trouble but the fact of the matter is uh the reason they're making the
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.040]  decisions that they have been making is because they've been
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.720]  flat out threatened i mean it's one thing to be threatened with hey you're
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.000]  not going to get reelected next time but it's another thing to be threatened
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.600]  hey you know we know about your wife we know about your children we know this
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:32.200]  we know that and and that's the kind of that's the
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.960]  field in which we are playing according to the sources i've got
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.040]  and and one thing too that uh ties into what you're talking about about that
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.080]  military directive and uh you were named by name
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:46.680]  according to my source uh for bringing this out but
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.920]  there are certain aspects of this the social security aspect of this military
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:54.520]  directive that was this directive
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.440]  is a nightmare according to my source a nightmare that this thing ever got out
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.960]  written in 2010 and all of a sudden now bam it's out
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:04.920]  a nightmare and of course and you're talking about this the
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.600]  reeducation camps for american document yeah fm3 uh 339-40 or
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:15.480]  3-39.40 um the the the document you were talking
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:19.960]  about earlier um it is meant for american citizens
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:24.600]  obviously page 168 of this my again is he saying he's saying they're pretty
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.480]  freaked out that that's out yeah and and yes
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:31.480]  absolutely and mention and look it came out on your program mentioned you by
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:35.400]  name and and and because and how that came about was i had
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.080]  conversation yesterday evening and said i'm scheduled to be on with you today
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:43.080]  and oh you know hey well guess what i mean this guy freaked a lot of people out
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:46.120]  here at you know at the high levels of of
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.160]  let me ask you a question why do you think i'm still alive and they haven't
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.640]  killed me or set me up i mean they've tried a few times and
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.920]  threatened me but why do you think i'm still alive i mean for the reason jim
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.320]  garrison said that once you're public enough they think it'll actually
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.160]  draw too much attention if they kill me or set me up
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.520]  exactly i believe you are still alive only because
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.640]  of of your uh of the level of your exposure
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:15.560]  and uh i mean truly that that's what i believe i mean i i i think if if you
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.480]  suddenly died if you if you got rebar bright part tomorrow
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.560]  there would be such an outcry from from the people who follow you who understand
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.160]  what you're all about that they're they don't they don't want to
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.640]  drag more attention to themselves at all and i think you know what else i
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:34.280]  think there's an element of spirituality here too
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:37.800]  look we're fighting it we're fighting pure evil here
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.240]  pure evil so i do think that god is on your side as well but that's just my
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:43.720]  opinion oh i know that and that's why i don't have any fear
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:47.960]  and but but it's also again 50 years ago people
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.840]  from inside government came out and said all this was coming and they got
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:53.400]  killed they got in prison because the system
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.560]  wanted to contain it the info's out now and they just want to assassinate my
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.520]  character for my idiosyncrasies and things
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.360]  and so they want to try to do that if they kill me it will murder me
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:08.120]  but why did they do Breitbart then well our intel was
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:11.560]  that they didn't release what was really going to be released uh obviously from
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:15.000]  threats and things he was saying it's weather under men it's meetings with
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.280]  communists it's basically the reeducation camp info is what i'm being
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:23.320]  told in similar areas but he had witnesses he he had dinner
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.480]  uh with the head of the weathermen uh a month before he died
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.840]  and so that's when they kill you if you've got
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.440]  film of obama you know in bed with a goat or whatever
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.720]  i'm not saying i really have that folks that's a joke that's when they send a
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.680]  hit team to kill you but if you're just somebody up there generally talking
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:44.120]  about the info they just try to assassinate your name
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:48.680]  and that's been happening so much lately uh to a lot of people a lot of great
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.000]  people i've been marginalized by and and and you're correct i mean
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.280]  under cast sunstein and others there are people who did nothing
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.640]  and and this is verified by my source they are paid
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.840]  to sit at computers all day long and use screen name anonymous names and go in
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  and cause trouble foment uh insurrection and forms and political
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:13.480]  forms on both sides of the aisle and and just disrupt everything hijack what
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.520]  they call hijacking threads this is what they do
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:21.240]  and especially attacking the character maligning the character of people like
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.600]  yourself i mean uh you know uh it's just it's
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.640]  incredible that we've actually have in this government
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.400]  uh disinformation disinformation agents that are actually being paid
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.400]  to sit at home you know in their jammies on the internet
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.240]  uh doing this and by the way as you mentioned that's declassified that's
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:43.320]  in the news and they've even got sophisticated megaphone robots
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:46.280]  is what they call them programs that go out and poses people

[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:26.120]  is our guest has a lot of amazing sources out there you can find out more
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:29.880]  on his website and in fact give us your website one more time and i want to
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.600]  ask you any other tidbits that particular source gave you
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:35.080]  other points you'd like to make before we start going to some of these phone
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:39.640]  calls sure our website is homeland security us
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.160]  dot com that's homeland security us dot com not affiliate with any government
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:46.920]  agency completely independent and in terms of
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:51.640]  other information about from my source of course you know he's hoping in
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.320]  none of this stuff happens flat out saying look i got a family and i got
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.080]  you know i hope none of this happens i hope i'm wrong but i want to tell you
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:04.200]  that uh... uh... that they just did it looks like everything right now is
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:06.920]  pointing toward this taking place this summer
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:10.360]  leading up to the elections and he said if for some reason we're able to get
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:13.000]  through this summer without any trouble whatsoever
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:18.120]  and if we have elections and i this is not a guy subject to hyperbole you know
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:21.160]  by using that kind of language but if we have elections
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.400]  he said watch very carefully between the time of the election day and inauguration
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:28.440]  day watch that time period watch for false flag
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:32.040]  operations the white house being shot at that was a false flag
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.480]  operation uh... that was a trial balloon he said
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:40.440]  uh... in in this source uh... again uh... this is amazing to me
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.880]  uh... i had a double check this and he confirmed it again
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:47.960]  uh... he says look there's something in the works i'm not sure what it is this
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:51.880]  is him talking not me he's i'm not sure what it is there's something in the works
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.360]  that uh... there is going to be a false flag against either the first
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:59.480]  family the first lady or the president himself
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:05.000]  and this is going to uh... you know facilitate that
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.800]  implement that racial divide and also garner sympathy for the president
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:12.840]  and i just i mean i find that very hard to believe of course
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:17.160]  not that he said this he said uh... obviously there are no plans for anyone
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.840]  to be hurt uh... but it's you know it's gonna it it's
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:24.360]  certainly going to appear to remember a decade ago whenever the taiwanese
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.360]  president was about to be thrown out so he stays a shooting of himself
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.720]  and then it came out i mean it's so obvious they want to make themselves
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.720]  heroes yeah it's it's crazy and you know i i'd look
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:40.920]  uh... belex i got a book and i gotta tell you this uh... i'm into old books
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.400]  uh... this book is a 1970 edition communism in the new left
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:48.680]  i picked this up in the end ronics and old bookstore
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:52.520]  this is their playbook this is their playbook this is what they're attempting
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.240]  to do everything that we're seeing happen today
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:59.480]  uh... was done in the sixties and it's the same people except now they're in
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:02.920]  leadership positions as opposed to being in the uh... protesting positions
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.360]  that's incredible well that's why we play that you know those clips talking
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.200]  about the weathermen want to kill 25 million americans in the camps
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.560]  like so i guess they want to put like 50 million in there and and and these
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.600]  people are running our government now and they want to kill people these are
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.600]  dirty murdering scum i mean they're just filth
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:23.480]  and if they if they don't kill you then they're going to have you building the
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.400]  bridges filling in the bottles in the roads and working for them i mean
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.960]  look at look at the mayor of uh... chicago he sat on c-spam when he was
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.480]  white house uh... chief of staff he said we're
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:38.680]  going to make everybody serve uh... people in high school
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.000]  in this new FEMA course thing oh yeah yeah indeed i'm sorry go ahead
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.840]  no and uh... just a couple more things here he said uh...
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:51.400]  whether or not the supreme regardless of how the supreme court rules
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:56.760]  uh... expect that uh... obama care is going to go on it is going to be
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.280]  uh... well i'm not sure it's exact wording here
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.800]  it's going to go through i mean they're going to do obama care in one way shape
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:07.640]  or form he's already started saying he didn't care what the supreme court says
[01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:11.960]  right now uh... he did say this according to what he heard
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:15.320]  that one or two of the supreme court justices should might be a little bit
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.720]  should be a little bit worried uh... depending on that on how that decision
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:22.120]  goes and that's not again that sounds pretty
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.600]  you know orwellian but hey i'm just telling what what i was told
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:31.080]  and and one last thing uh... but i'm a contributing editor for canada free

[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:43.560]  really turned out to be incredibly accurate and and the rest of it is
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:48.200]  coming to our wish that wasn't the case but knowing is half the battle as they
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.880]  say in gi joe and knowing what we're facing getting out of
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:55.320]  denial gives us a chance to beat this look i wouldn't be
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.040]  risking my life if i didn't think we could beat these people
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.520]  even if i end up getting killed or put in prison
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:04.040]  you got to say no to this type of tyranny my children have no future
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.960]  and i can't just give into fear even on threats to them
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:11.320]  i just have to commit to this because these people are crooks
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:15.320]  they're nasty crooks and our forebears stood up to these type of people and
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:18.760]  we've got to do the same look some stations don't carry this first five
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:22.120]  minutes most of them do but i want to come back and get into the
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.280]  other point that your sources and that writer uh
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:29.160]  that you were just mentioning was telling you but let's start going to call
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:32.360]  us now and then get into the other points your sources have told you
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:35.000]  before you leave us at the bottom of the hour and then i'll get into other news
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.240]  after that folks let's talk to michael in florida michael you're on the air
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.040]  welcome hey how are you guys doing pretty good what's on your mind
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.320]  well i wanted to know what what you guys think uh
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.080]  you know the average american voter what what we're gonna get
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:55.000]  off of this re-elect election because you know
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.240]  you see the left right thing is fake and um
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:03.160]  you know pretty much if they don't give ron paul a chance like
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:07.240]  i think we should just take uh pretty much everybody who's in the house
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:12.040]  now who's not acting responsibly we should take those guys to court
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:15.720]  well there are i mean look at luger losing in the primary
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.640]  uh big establishment guide there is a surge of patriot
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:22.520]  ron paul tea party types the original tea party
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.200]  who are winning elections at every level so uh that's
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.480]  that's why the globalists want to accelerate their takeover because as
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:32.840]  they said they're worried about the counter revolution those of us that
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.760]  still want to have a free country we are seen as the enemy the extremists the
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:40.760]  bad guys dug your comments i totally agree i mean
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.960]  look the right left paradigm as you've pointed out many many times that's over
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:48.200]  it's done the con there's a continuity of agenda at play here
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:54.200]  uh our only hope is someone who will uphold the constitution get back to
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:58.040]  the constitution and who might that be well we've got ron paul
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.520]  well you've got all these crooks in government who are connected to each
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.480]  other if we could just start getting that information out that's why they're
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:06.760]  arresting whistleblowers and start indicting and imprisoning them
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:09.800]  they'll all run like a bunch of rats leaving a sinking ship
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.960]  because when the corruption's this bad you're able sometimes to just flip the
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.240]  switch and it it starts collapsing even faster
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:22.040]  but instead they just want to take over yeah indeed no you're exactly right i
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:26.040]  mean the act like cockroaches i mean in that case
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:30.280]  and that's a pretty apt description in my in my opinion
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:33.240]  well they're able to operate because of all these good men and women and private
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.000]  society citizens police military who are compartmentalized and don't
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.200]  know the big picture doesn't make sense to them but they still follow orders
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:44.440]  but once we expose what's happening behind the curtain
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:48.280]  then people go oh that makes sense and then it loses its power i mean i
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:51.160]  look i'm not trying to put a good face on this because this situation is dire
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:54.440]  dug but i'm seeing an explosive awakening what are you saying
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:58.280]  oh the same thing but but i'm also seeing uh you know we
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:02.920]  there's still people that that that will uh will just subject them to themselves
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.120]  to this uh unconstitutional unconstitutional search and
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:09.480]  seizure at the airports this you know their group adopts their everything's
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.960]  fine this this is necessary to keep us safe
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.320]  there's still too many of those people there's still there's still too many of
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.480]  the people who believe in the the uh the theater that's being
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:23.480]  that that we're uh being treated to we've got to convince the people that
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:26.520]  this is not right and not only convince them and educate them
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:30.840]  but help them act stand together look we all have to you know i use the example
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:33.800]  like this one person at an airport says no i'm not going to
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:36.440]  i'm not going to subject myself to this they're going to get arrested
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.880]  half a dozen it's going to become a news report you get everyone
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.000]  what are they going to do they're going to back it was the opt out they knew
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.360]  people were going to say no that day they didn't want to give us a chance to
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:49.560]  have a victory together because that would have built our confidence
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:54.120]  so for a week they stood down showing their powerless and the terror threat
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:58.280]  was manufactured in that case we'll be right back i want to expound on that and

[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:06.360]  take the political dissidents and lock your butt up
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.840]  I mean this is the confession of an illegal illegitimate criminal group
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.400]  running the government I wonder who leaked this Doug and we're
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.800]  going to go back to phone calls because I could you know one level I
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:23.560]  think they put it out to scare people but on another level
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:27.400]  they don't want people waking up I mean just like Obama
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:31.000]  said he didn't want the NDAA but then he signed it and then it turned out
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.080]  he had demanded the secret arrest provision these are big wake-up calls
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.920]  for people exactly and you know it's kind of
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:42.120]  funny I don't know who leaked that document but I don't believe it was
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:46.360]  intended to be leaked just simply because for example on page 168 it gets
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:49.720]  into the vetting of religious leaders I mean
[02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:54.200]  this is some incendiary type language oh yeah I forgot that
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.360]  it talks about fighting militias say that again though vetting the religious
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.840]  leaders which is the clergy response team
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:06.040]  yeah in fact my son had gone through this document with a fine-tooth comb
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.440]  spent actually two nights going through this and page 168
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.280]  it talks about religious discussion groups
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:19.400]  will be offered to the detainees as programs to educate them on specific
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:23.960]  aspects of their religion to moderate them and to take the
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.400]  edge off of them yeah that's Romans 13 which they admit the feds
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:31.080]  yeah just say it's of the Lord take the shot let us take your kids it's of the
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:34.600]  Lord that's right and and they did not want this
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:39.720]  information out there I mean again you know by you breaking this and I
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:43.560]  believe you did yes break this okay I mean
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.840]  there there there were a lot of people the pucker factor
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:50.200]  as the as my source calls it it was incredible
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:54.840]  to think that this was actually leaked and I'd be surprised by the way if you
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:58.360]  get a call back from that sort of from the spokesperson but that's just you
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:01.000]  know it's great that you did that but but no I mean
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:07.800]  this was not supposed to be leaked out and let me ask you this question then
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:11.480]  what do you what do you think the military is saying about this document
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:14.440]  I mean now they've called in and said they're very angry police have called in
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:17.800]  I mean I've noticed that the media here's my
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:23.720]  main question why is the mainstream corporate dinosaur media will normally
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:26.120]  make fun of something I say but then admit it's real
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:31.720]  I've noticed complete silence on this it is deafening and it's really showing me
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:35.480]  just how many even alternative groups out there are controlled
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.440]  the fact this is real it's admitted it's real and no one wants to touch it
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:43.960]  well simply because it's indefensible how can one
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:49.400]  defend against this document there's just no way to coherently
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:53.240]  engage in any type of coherent or legitimate defense
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:58.120]  so why not just forget about it why not pretend it doesn't exist
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.280]  the american people have a great way of just forgetting about everything as
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:05.080]  long as you know american idols on or whatever show
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:08.200]  you know of the night is on we can forget about this
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:12.280]  you know and and of course now you know with that underwear thing that that
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:16.200]  brand new underwear scare that we got well you know that gives us something
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.880]  different to talk about that legitimizes the tsa takes the you know
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:23.480]  perhaps takes the attention off of this or it'll be something else
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.440]  but again i gotta tell you this document was not supposed to be leaked
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.960]  well we need to force it out into the media and now that the army's responded
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:35.960]  and admitted and i said yes it's real we have got to get
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:39.080]  people discussing this everywhere this is a big issue
[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:44.840]  yes it is let's go to gonzalo in michigan you're on the air go ahead
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:48.840]  hey what's up you guys uh it's like to say uh you really make me laugh a lot
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:52.680]  jones we do your impersonations uh it's uh really hilarious when uh
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.360]  you know when it comes down to all this uh serious type things
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:59.400]  and uh yeah dhs has been rolling around my city
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:03.480]  in their little uh their little white sqv thinking they're all bad with the
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:06.280]  little triangles on and stuff you know and i just
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:09.400]  what's it what's it bring those checkpoints down here to me it's on
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.040]  that's when it's on when they start groping people
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:14.920]  like just all in the cities and i know they're doing it already in other states
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:19.000]  but to me that's when it's on and if people are here so brainwashed they
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.320]  won't even save water i tell them to you know they can't afford to
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:27.080]  talk about anything talk about water and they still won't even do that
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:29.560]  and it just really makes me you know you've got a lot of the public
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.400]  scientifically mesmerized and drugged out of their minds and i really feel
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.320]  sorry for them as this collapse uh accelerates but uh
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.040]  i appreciate your call yeah what about federal police and then tsa aren't even
[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:43.960]  police they're not trained they're not sworn
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:48.280]  and but they can come to a town like in uh new mexico and say
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:53.000]  grop everyone at the prom we order you to out of their jurisdiction not even
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.200]  real police uh violating the fourth amendment
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:00.360]  it's it's just it's marshal law it's what it is
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:04.440]  the tsa workers are not as you point out they're not commissioned law enforcement
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.800]  officers in every state there are programs uh that uh you you must take to
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:14.280]  become municipal police officers state police is a little bit different uh
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  these tsa workers number one have not gone through the proper
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.360]  background checks i think you pointed that out
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:23.400]  number uh now they're admitting some don't even get them now because
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:27.240]  because it's not getting the scum they want well that's true
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:31.400]  and i said some of this is supposed to have supposed to have been
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.960]  uh the background given to uh third-party uh companies like like our
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.320]  company we do background checks for fortune 100 companies
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:42.600]  okay that's not happening it's not happening with these people
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:46.120]  um but but alex if you can indulge me for a minute one thing i did want to get
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:49.880]  to about this when i was talking about gene mccloudon can the free press
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:55.240]  uh she'd give me some information that dovetailed with uh some information
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.400]  that my source gave me concerning fast and furious
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:03.160]  that being a potential problem for this administration
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.160]  according to the information we have uh attorney general eric holder is not
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:10.680]  going to have any problems whatsoever from darrell isaac and others
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.960]  uh because remember holder was the key figure
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:19.240]  who vetted the clinton administration's pardons the remember that 180 minute
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.840]  last minute pardons back in january 20 uh 2001
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:27.880]  the beneficiaries of whom included uh former weather underground members
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:34.440]  susan rozenberg and uh linda evans for example there's debts owed that are not
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:37.080]  going to be pay or that that must be paid holder
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:42.200]  holds some uh some chips if you will and uh as a result of that isaac is not
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:46.520]  going to take them out okay because i want to make sure i got that in there
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.600]  sorry if i got you off track no no we ran into a break last hour i'm glad you
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:53.480]  remembered that in fact i want to go back to calls now but what are some of the
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:56.520]  other things your sources are telling you that are important
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:01.160]  well just watch what europe is doing and and and he said this too uh again the
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:03.960]  initial conversation was on april 25th i believe
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.880]  uh watch what europe is doing when you start seeing europe
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:11.160]  crumble or use the economically crumble that is
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:14.760]  uh you can start counting down you've got some you know you've really only got
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:19.800]  weeks uh maybe months until it hits it hits here
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:22.840]  watch very carefully what china does
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:26.440]  if once they start calling in uh their debt
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.280]  if they do um as far as military is concerned
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:34.760]  uh this comes from a different source there are spets knots
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:37.800]  in this country now we've always had mutual aid
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:41.960]  or cross training of various foreign troops that's always been there
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:45.880]  and of course you know the rebuttal to foreign troops in this country
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:50.680]  uh but by the uh by the you know neo cons if you will or the people that
[02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:53.400]  then say uh it's normal it's normal for this no no
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:57.000]  we're talking about spets on a strip specially trained
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.400]  in in detention and torture i've gotten reports as well
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:05.560]  uh now it's about people about our military in afghanistan
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:09.160]  they uh they are being trained in detention
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:13.000]  as opposed to combat now who are they detaining them that certainly they're
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.360]  not detaining uh you know it's a catch and release status over in
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.760]  afghanistan but according to the information we have
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:24.840]  this uh that the training for detention is to be used here in this country
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:27.720]  and there be our troops are being desensitized well that's what the
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:31.160]  document states i mean i've read public army documents where they say
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.000]  all these wars are laboratories that they can then deploy domestically
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.280]  it's just total trees in brian in california you're on the air welcome
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:46.920]  oh hey alex hey doug how you doing good uh well i just um wanted to bring that
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:50.600]  up i've read reports about russian troops actually exercising um in
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:54.760]  colorado uh at the end of this month no that's mainstream news that's
[02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:59.240]  may that's in cbs news and people still don't believe it's real because oh
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.240]  that that's not possible right and that dovetails obviously
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:07.160]  then with a a nice nato meeting that's that's going on in chicago and
[02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:11.320]  don't forget the g8 uh being in their hardened bunker there at the camp
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:14.760]  pivot um you know it would be interesting to see if maybe if some of
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:18.840]  those troops actually got left here you know and that dovetails maybe with
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:23.720]  joel scousins um prediction that you know uh russia and
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:27.960]  china um i'm the sneak attack that's that's uh predicting um
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:31.720]  for the united states are putting that down the road though but i mean expanding
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:35.240]  on that they use g20 they use nato any meeting
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:38.280]  to just say no protest in the city no being out
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:42.840]  arrest whoever you want loudspeakers black tanks police with military
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:46.280]  these are all little martial law training events and they admit
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:49.000]  that's what they are doug your comments on that
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.520]  well you're a hundred percent right just connect the dots and that's what i've
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:55.320]  been told look everything that this guy has done
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:18:57.800]  meaning barraque is saying about everything he's done
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:02.120]  and also bush as well and and and clinton before him
[02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:05.640]  start connecting the dots they're all globalist this is one big continuity of
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:10.200]  agenda program here and uh you know if you think that uh
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.240]  it's anything different you're crazy but you can see
[02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:17.400]  the acceleration happening right now you can sense the beginning of the year
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:20.920]  you've got you know like you said like we said the ndaa
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:25.000]  uh the various other executive orders all of these things taking place
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.400]  and things are accelerating at such a pace that you can barely keep up when
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:32.840]  they emerge and admit everything we've talked about is true but say it's good
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:35.160]  for us that means they're getting ready to use it
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:39.960]  they don't un-cloak until they fire to use a cheesy star trek analogy when to
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:43.880]  the klingons un-cloak they've got to un-cloak to fire
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.320]  and and and and just like a submarine has to service to launch its
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:50.920]  Polaris missiles or whatever they they're un-cloaking because they're like oh
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:54.840]  there are troops in checkpoints a cigarette arrest it's good
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:59.160]  don't run we are your friends so the military sees that and thinks well it
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:02.920]  must be okay they're being public for a long time you've heard me talk about
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:06.360]  building your own food supply with e-foods direct as a listener you know
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:09.400]  why you need to have a supply of the best horrible food on the planet
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:13.400]  every day we document the attempts to take control of our lives
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.160]  but there's one thing we can all control your greatest dependency
[02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:21.000]  food e-foods direct products are made with only the best ingredients
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.520]  and none of the trash and contaminants like trans fats gmo's
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.960]  or msg this food is nutrient dense and tastes great
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:31.880]  it's simple to make portable and has a shelf life of up to 25 years
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:35.160]  now with e-foods direct you'll get the most affordable best tasting food you

[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:47.080]  uh for that civilian army that he wants now
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:50.600]  when you guys were talking a little earlier i made a correlation

[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:34.520]  well you know exactly right the media is in it they're facilitating this
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:39.640]  uh i mean they're working for obama the the media is working for obama in this
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:44.040]  case uh in particular uh with respect to the uh the racial
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:47.480]  division uh as a matter of fact according to the
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:52.920]  information i received recently there were high-level meetings that took place
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:58.520]  uh between uh uh between uh some of obama zars and heads of
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.560]  what the five or six media conglomerates okay
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:05.400]  they're planning this out and and and it's it's
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:09.800]  it's everything's being staged you um i was told don't believe
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:14.600]  anything that you even see on the news uh or don't believe what you see i mean
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:19.240]  it's again because it's all being staged thank you caller good points let's
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:22.680]  talk to josh in california moving quickly josh welcome
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:25.720]  how you doing i have a couple questions for you and doug real quick if that's
[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:29.720]  okay sure go ahead sir thank you yeah my my first question is um
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:34.680]  hey recently uh i was i was you know i turned somebody on to you
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:37.960]  and uh they stopped listening to you already and it's only been a few weeks
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:41.320]  and i asked them why they stopped listening to you and they told me
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:45.560]  that they read an article on the interweb
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:49.480]  oh the even interweb they said that you uh you have
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:53.240]  oh yeah you give us information about the new world order and
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:56.920]  all the stuff that's going on but you don't give us any solutions well that's
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:00.440]  not true sir i mean all again these are the classic things
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:03.480]  we're getting grassroots people involved people running
[02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:06.760]  we're calling for people to be prosecuted for fashion furious
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:10.760]  we're calling to get the word out about this stuff so that they can't implement
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:13.560]  it so there's debates in the military and police
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:17.240]  i mean talking about this exposing it there's a reason they're going after
[02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:21.240]  whistleblowers and people so so that's great i mean let people
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:24.920]  not listen to this show there's other ones it's not about me
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:28.680]  it's about the information it's not even about who breaks something first or
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:31.320]  who covers something people always think too just because
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.520]  we're covering something that they might have seen somewhere else that
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:38.600]  that means that you know we didn't give them credit it's all about territory and
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:42.760]  who's good and who isn't look folks it doesn't matter who Alex Jones is this
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:45.880]  new world order is real we need to deal with it
[02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:49.400]  and not just spend all day critiquing what i'm doing
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:52.680]  lord knows i could do about a radio show but nobody's perfect
[02:27:52.680 --> 02:27:56.280]  but it isn't about Alex Jones it isn't about Doug
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:59.720]  Hagman it's about what's happening in our society Doug
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:03.640]  comments on that yeah everyone wants to be so
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:07.160]  territorial and of course the divisiveness in this is
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:11.240]  incredible but it's planned i mean part of this is planned as well
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:14.440]  you've got the people the infiltrators out there
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:17.640]  whether it's the tea party movement or the occupy movement or whatever
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:21.000]  they're going to go in there and they're going to cast blame and divisiveness in
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.040]  all of this it's all part of the plan the other people the
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:27.400]  other people who complain are just complainers and if somebody
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.720]  doesn't do it for them well then it doesn't get done
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.640]  i mean it's simple as that but the but look yeah i mean we're just breaking
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:36.280]  news and stuff here and people say well where's the solution
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:41.000]  all we do is is say in the fed restore the republic
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  cut taxes don't pay 20 billion dollars to ship general motors overseas
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.360]  all we're talking i'm i'm exposing that these power companies
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:51.320]  uh are using obama to shut down their competition
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:54.840]  knowledge is the power the awareness of the crime but

[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:11.160]  their top confab the bill de berg road meet in north america either in canada
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:15.720]  or on the east coast of the united states four years ago and obama was
[02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:19.320]  coordinated supreme ruler before the public was told about it he and
[02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:22.920]  hillary went in there and she stepped down there at that meeting and they
[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:26.760]  thought that obama could sell fraud and fake hope and change
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:31.000]  better than her we covered it the national media refused to come
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.520]  while it was the top story no one knew where hillary and obama had gone for
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:38.760]  the day an entire day well i was there covering it
[02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:41.960]  so another illustration of how the mainstream media
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:45.400]  won't do their job just like they wouldn't do their job of bohemian grove
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:49.560]  so i had to infiltrate it tried to infiltrate year and a half ago as well
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:56.040]  barely escaped in the history channel camera crew got arrested but
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:34:00.840]  that's another issue so we're taking action with solutions
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:05.800]  exposing these people and a big solution is to have occupy bill de berg that i
[02:34:05.800 --> 02:34:09.160]  called for a few weeks ago it's been picked up by a lot of other groups in
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:13.320]  media major steam building i'm going to be there the 31st of

[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:34.320]  He is a listener.

[02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:05.560]  Now I'm not doing very good Mike Judge imitations.
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:07.920]  I can do them better when I'm not trying on air.
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:12.440]  Oh, boy.
[02:38:12.440 --> 02:38:13.320]  This is fun.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:19.720]  Elevator music brought to you by the Westfields Marriott.
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:21.960]  Side of the 2012 Bilderberg group meeting.
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:29.280]  Managers are in meetings.
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:32.560]  But looking at our system, we have the SRA conference.
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:34.200]  The SRA conference?
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:35.280]  Correct.
[02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:36.160]  No, that's not it.
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.680]  That's all you have is the SRA conference.
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:39.840]  And then we have three weddings.
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:45.800]  During those three days?
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:48.520]  I don't know how long they're here for.
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:51.120]  OK, well, I must have the wrong one.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:53.520]  I've got to probably call you back, ma'am.
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:55.920]  Let me just ask you this.
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:38:58.400]  Is the hotel, because the one I'm going to,
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:01.280]  they told me they booked the whole thing,
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:04.880]  the 31st of this month to the third of next month,
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:07.200]  are you booked up then?
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:11.320]  We do have rooms to sell during some of those days.
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:12.080]  Say that again?
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.280]  We do have rooms for sale over some of those days.
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:17.160]  But I called there.
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:18.640]  I called there last week, and they
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:22.480]  said that it was completely booked on those days.
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:24.400]  The 31st through the third.
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.840]  We could have had some cancellation.
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:30.200]  No, ma'am, they were telling me the entire.
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:33.680]  OK, I want to book one for June 1st.
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:35.040]  They're at the Westfields Marriott.
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:36.920]  OK, let me translate your reservations,
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:38.640]  and they can assist you with that just a moment.
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:41.440]  OK, by the way, folks, we've called five times,
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:43.120]  and they won't let us book during that day.
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.240]  They'll let us book the day before.
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:47.280]  I see, well, we're just doing this on air.
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.520]  I am just making sure.
[02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:53.840]  Please see our privacy statement at marriott.com
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:57.680]  to understand how we use and protect information.
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:00.480]  Anyways, we're just making sure Bill LaBerg is there.
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:02.000]  But it's already on to occupy it.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:05.200]  That is, cover it peacefully, and demand media attention.
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.160]  Demand the corporate press to media cover it.
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:09.920]  Good afternoon.
[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:11.800]  Thank you for calling to Marriott Westfields,
[02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:12.720]  Washington, Dallas.
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:13.600]  My name is Chris.
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:14.720]  How can I help you?
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:19.720]  Hey, yes, I'd like to book a room there, June 1st, please.
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:21.400]  Thank you, just for the one night, sir.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:21.960]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:28.000]  Are you coming in for an event or just coming into visit?
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.800]  What, the SRA conference or the Palm Tree conference?
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:31.400]  One moment.
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:38.360]  Oh, boy, I tell you.
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.400]  Hey, Marge, can you bring me a cup of coffee?
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:42.200]  Thanks.
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:44.840]  I'm Ralph Cramden.
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:46.240]  Sounds like him.
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:47.120]  I do sound like him?
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:49.680]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:50.960]  How are you doing?
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:53.400]  How are you doing today, ma'am?
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:54.000]  Just a minute.
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:59.600]  How's the weather in your area?
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.200]  It's getting there.
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:02.920]  Good.
[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:06.520]  Just want to check your one moment, please.
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:08.360]  Thank you.
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:11.240]  Have you registered for this Palm Tree conference, sir,
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:12.480]  or?
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:14.480]  Oh, it's Plum Tree or is it Palm Tree?
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:16.120]  Palm Tree, Palm Tree.
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:17.920]  Oh, you do find the Palm Tree conference there?
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:18.680]  Yeah, there is.
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:20.520]  But it's a rooming list only, which
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:24.760]  leads me to believe there's some sort of pre-registration.
[02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:26.640]  And then they have your name, and then they
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:28.920]  make the reservation for you.
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:32.520]  Oh, yes, yes, David Rockefeller.
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:37.000]  No, but you, just a minute.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:40.880]  Hey, can you check and see if my name's there?
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:42.520]  I will.
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:43.600]  La-ta-ta-ta.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:44.120]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:45.320]  Guys, turn that music off.
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:46.880]  I enjoy it too much.
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:48.080]  I'm over here at the office.
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:50.280]  I shouldn't be doing this on my lunch break.
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:52.480]  You know, you've got to book these vacations sometimes,
[02:41:52.480 --> 02:41:54.320]  or they've got a good golf course nearby.
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:54.840]  They do.
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.840]  They do.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:58.600]  First of June, one moment.
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:01.200]  I don't have your name yet.
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:07.400]  The block of rooms does not shut down until the 11th, which
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:08.400]  is two days from now.
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:10.600]  And that's when the name should be coming in.
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:13.920]  OK, OK.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:15.680]  Can I separately book a room there?
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:16.280]  Or is the?
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:17.680]  No, you could do that.
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:19.480]  OK, so you're going to book a room there?
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:20.880]  No, you could do that.
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:22.680]  OK, so you're going to book a room there?
[02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:23.680]  No, you could do that.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:25.680]  OK, so you're going to book a room there?
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:27.680]  No, you could do that.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:30.560]  OK, so the hotel is not booked up for those days?
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:31.080]  It is.
[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:32.360]  Unfortunately, it is.
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:34.080]  So I just checked that.
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:35.560]  Oh.
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:37.600]  Now, there are six Marriottes in the area.
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:39.920]  The closest one with availability
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:42.600]  is the Fairfax Barrow, six miles east,
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:43.760]  or the Washington Dulles.
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:44.400]  Hold on, ma'am.
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:46.600]  I've actually got.
[02:42:46.600 --> 02:42:47.640]  I'm booking it for him.
[02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:49.680]  But I've got David Rockefeller here right with me.
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:51.960]  Can I just put him on the phone with you so he can do it?
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:52.560]  Yeah.
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:53.240]  Hold on one second.
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:54.920]  Hey, Dave, come on over here.
[02:42:54.920 --> 02:42:57.200]  Yes, yes, sir.
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:58.560]  Sir, please don't call me sir.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:42:59.600]  I'm your assistant.
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:00.680]  Very well.
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:02.800]  I, hello there, young lady.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:04.880]  How are you taking all your vaccines
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:07.520]  like you're supposed to?
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:08.440]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:09.560]  Good.
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:13.320]  What do you think of global government, huh?
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:16.280]  Have you heard of my family?
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:19.400]  Do you want to book at another hotel, Mr. Rockefeller?
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:21.040]  Well, dear, I'll be there.
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:23.400]  Don't worry, that rascally rabbit.
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:26.040]  Alex Jones will probably be bull-harning me.
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:29.880]  OK, disconnecting.
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:32.880]  All right, good evening, my dear.
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:33.480]  Bye-bye.
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:39.760]  Well, that little chip, that little bird
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:42.040]  about the palm tree conference, you know,
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:44.760]  they death-threaded my wife last time.
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:45.920]  I went and bull-horned them.
[02:43:45.920 --> 02:43:48.480]  They are certainly not going to be happy about this.
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:58.480]  Oh, man, oh, boy, I don't even know if I can continue now.
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:00.800]  This is total twilight zone.
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:02.720]  All right, that's definitely where they're having it.
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:06.320]  We've made, like, four or five of these calls on air.
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:09.480]  That poor lady, I was just doing a David Rockefeller thing.
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:14.000]  I was about to ask her, are you going to be there when I'm there?
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.400]  But I wasn't going to do it.
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:16.640]  I was going to be really bad.
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:19.560]  I was going to be really bad.
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:21.960]  Oh, I forget I'm on radio sometimes.
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:22.760]  I really do.
[02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:25.120]  I'm more eloquent when I'm not on the radio.
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:26.520]  That's actually not true.
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:28.320]  Sometimes when I'm directing shoots out there,
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:30.440]  I hear myself talking in the background on the tapes later.
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:33.800]  It sounds like some cross between an Appalachian hillbilly
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:36.080]  and an East Texan, which I guess I kind of am in a way.
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:39.120]  By the way, I wasn't bashing Appalachian hillbillies last
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:42.480]  time on the news when I was comparing the Taliban
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:44.880]  to souped-up hillbillies.
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:47.000]  I was explaining that it's hard for the globalists
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.800]  to take over groups like that.
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:49.800]  That's all I was saying.
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:55.560]  Just talking about hillbillies is not insulting.
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:58.760]  I have a real live hillbilly working out there in the control
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:00.240]  room right now, don't I?
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:02.920]  It does a great job.
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.920]  The truth is the hillbillies have the advanced, supercharged
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:09.920]  brain cells.
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:14.360]  I myself am a super supreme purebred hillbilly.
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.440]  Anyways, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:19.680]  That was funny.
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:22.040]  Am I wrong or was that funny just now?
[02:45:22.040 --> 02:45:24.880]  Doing the David Rockefeller intertake.
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:27.920]  I should have done it a lot better, though, like, oh, well,
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:30.200]  I guess I'll need some help there.
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:34.280]  All right, that's enough.
[02:45:34.280 --> 02:45:34.960]  That's enough.
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:36.040]  I'm like the hell 9,000.
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:38.000]  Just a moment, just a moment.
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.360]  We have a lot of important news here.
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:43.640]  FEMA Covens being moved northbound on Georgia Highway.
[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:45.320]  There's photos of that at Before It's News.
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:47.600]  We'll get those up at infowars.com.
[02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:49.600]  Congressional Democrats introduced amendment
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:51.160]  to outlaw self-defense.
[02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:53.080]  Well, that sounds reasonable.
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:56.720]  Democrats have now withdrawn the Trayvon Amendment for now.
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:59.520]  That's just some of the news we have there.
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:03.360]  And some of the other self-defense news here.
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:08.000]  UK banned self-defense expert from entering country.
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.920]  Government wants a nation of cowardly, defenseless victims.
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:14.120]  The UK government has banned self-defense expert
[02:46:14.120 --> 02:46:17.640]  former US Navy SEAL Tim Larkin from entering the country.
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:19.240]  And Larkin planned to hold seminars
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:21.760]  on certain people, how to protect themselves
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:22.920]  from rioters and criminals.
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:24.400]  Well, the government's a bunch of rioters,
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.640]  globalist criminals.
[02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:29.320]  So they certainly cannot allow that, my pretty.
[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:35.080]  Continuing here with the news, Google self-driving car
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:37.840]  licensed to hit Nevada streets.
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:41.720]  Google modified Toyota Prius was given the thumbs up
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:44.840]  for successful test drives in Carson City
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:46.680]  and on the Vegas Strip.
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:48.800]  And they're going to say that cars drive better than us.
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:50.400]  They've already been covering up wrecks with them
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:52.240]  in the last few years, other parts of the country.
[02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:54.640]  And pretty soon, you won't be allowed to drive your own car
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:56.680]  or a 18-wheeler, because the insurance companies are
[02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:58.800]  the big banks, are the new world order.
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:00.320]  There's another article here.
[02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:03.360]  Spy blimps in the UK and US skies.
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:04.640]  The media is now ready to tell us what
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:06.680]  I told you about 10 years ago.
[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:09.800]  Also, there's more news.
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:11.520]  The DOJ is being told by Congress
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:13.160]  if you won't give us fast and furious docs,
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.480]  we're going to dock your pay.
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:19.040]  We're going to dock the mafia's pay.
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:21.120]  And then another video report from last night,
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:24.440]  circling the globalist rat hole, Occupy Bilderberg gains
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:26.920]  momentum.
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.680]  And again, my Occupy Bilderberg is peacefully
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:33.240]  to surround the place, have alternative media coverage,
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:34.640]  because we're the real media, and try
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:37.480]  to have such a spectacle of at least a few thousand people
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:38.200]  there.
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:43.760]  I think we should go for, I think we should all
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:45.680]  shoot for, guys, pull up the calendar.
[02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:49.240]  What is June 1st?
[02:47:49.240 --> 02:47:51.120]  What is that, a Friday?
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:51.640]  Pull that up.
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:53.440]  I want to think of the best day, because you'll
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.640]  have like 300 people one day and 200 another,
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:47:58.320]  and then 100 the next and 200.
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:00.840]  We need to focus on one day.
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:03.520]  Obviously, we can be there the whole time, but one day,
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:06.240]  one hour, where everybody agrees that we're
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:09.360]  going to surround that place, like Jericho.
[02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:16.200]  And basically, bullhorn them from all directions.
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:18.200]  That is a nice calendar.
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.800]  They just put a calendar on screen.
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:21.280]  I can't even see anything on it.
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:21.960]  It doesn't matter.
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:24.160]  It is a Friday.
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:26.680]  I think a lot of people are having to work,
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:32.560]  having to do stuff, but if you can take off that Friday,
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:33.840]  Saturday probably be the best day,
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:36.600]  but they'll already all be inside then.
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:38.440]  Really, though, Thursdays when they arrive,
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:39.880]  some arrive Friday.
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:41.800]  So really, the best time, I think,
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:46.720]  is we should have one event Friday at, say, 6 o'clock
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:49.680]  there at the Westfields Marriott outside on the sidewalk.
[02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:55.040]  And then we should have one, say, Saturday at 5 o'clock
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:56.200]  as well.
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:00.720]  In fact, let's just say Thursday, if you can be there,
[02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:03.720]  starting at 1.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:05.200]  Because that's when a lot of them are arriving.
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:06.880]  That's a prime time.
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:11.000]  Thursday at 1, Friday at 5, Saturday at 5,
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.120]  Sunday at 1, because that's when they're leaving
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:15.400]  is right around that time.
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:17.240]  But we need one big mass point.
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:19.000]  So let's say it's Saturday evening.
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.840]  Everybody be there at 5 o'clock.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:22.960]  Come with your wagons.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:24.480]  Come with your everything.
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:25.880]  Just be there.
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:26.920]  It's like a wagon train.
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:30.400]  Everybody needs to be there.
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:31.960]  That's Eastern time in Virginia.
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:34.960]  Not InfoWars time from Hillbilly Command Base, Austin.
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:38.760]  Oh, man.
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:48.120]  Anyways, I don't know why I'm having such a good time today.
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:49.240]  I got a lot of callers here.
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:52.160]  We're going to come back and jam a few of those in.
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:54.440]  Aaron, Bill, Kim, John, Stan, we'll
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.200]  try to get to all of you here coming up.
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:00.960]  A lot of other news as well that's up at infowars.com
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:03.960]  and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:05.840]  The bankers are strangling Europe as usual,
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:07.680]  sucking everything out of them with the press
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:10.520]  to media telling them that the public, that the debt is owed
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:12.040]  by them, not by the bankers.
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:13.560]  90 plus percent of it in derivatives.
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:15.080]  We've got big reports on that.
[02:50:15.080 --> 02:50:17.360]  Spain bank problems, loom over markets.
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:18.800]  We told you Spain would come next.
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:22.040]  The globalists are gobbling each country kind of all a cart,
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:25.080]  like bring me a ham sandwich, and then they eat that country.
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:27.560]  Bring me a filet mignon, and they bring them that country.
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:28.720]  Bring me another.
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:31.960]  And then it's just how they operate.
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:34.040]  A little over a year ago, I began
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:36.600]  to do a lot of research into why, even if I
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.080]  had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:41.560]  And my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:44.360]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:46.960]  in the United States and across the industrialized world
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:49.840]  are almost completely depleted of almost all
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:52.400]  of the key minerals and trace elements
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:55.960]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer,
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:56.760]  and be healthy.
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:51:00.560]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.920]  out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:04.880]  The Young Jevity products are designed
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:07.000]  to give you the real nutrition you need.
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.760]  And once you've got that, you don't
[02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:10.920]  have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:14.360]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months,
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:17.280]  simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:18.480]  Check it out for yourself.

[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:33.240]  Are you storing food?
[02:51:33.240 --> 02:51:36.480]  Prepared families are storing food for months and years,
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:39.360]  but only having a fuel stored for days or weeks.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:42.040]  Stretch your fuel storage by harnessing the power
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:43.840]  of the sun with a sun oven.
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:45.960]  Food can be baked, boiled, or steamed
[02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:49.040]  at temperatures of 360 to 400 degrees
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:50.400]  with the power of the sun.
[02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:53.640]  You can use the sun for 50% to 80% of your cooking,
[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:55.560]  allowing you to preserve your fuel storage
[02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:56.640]  for rainy days.
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:51:59.520]  Sun baked foods stay moisture and have less shrinkage
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:00.640]  and do not burn.
[02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:03.320]  Sun baked roasts are tastier and more succulent,
[02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:06.680]  and sun baked bread has unparalleled taste and texture.
[02:52:06.680 --> 02:52:09.520]  Water can be heated in a sun oven for purification
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:10.920]  or personal hygiene.
[02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:13.440]  For the past 26 years, sun ovens have
[02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:15.320]  been proudly made in the US.

[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:35.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:39.040]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show,
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:41.920]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:44.920]  Yeah, the CIA has foiled its own CIA plot,
[02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:46.680]  and then they're congratulating themselves
[02:53:46.680 --> 02:53:48.480]  because that info leaked out.
[02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:49.880]  Another provocateur to action.
[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:52.520]  We're going to cover that in detail down on the InfoWars.
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:54.480]  Nightly news, let's jam in some more calls.
[02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:57.960]  Aaron, in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:53:57.960 --> 02:54:00.200]  Alex, first time caller, so I'm a little nervous.
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:02.120]  But real quick, before I get on to my question,
[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:03.880]  I just want to thank you and your team
[02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:06.720]  for doing what you guys are doing, you know, waking me up.
[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:08.720]  I appreciate that fully, and I'm trying to wake up
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:10.640]  as many people as I can.
[02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.560]  But let me get on to my question.
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:15.360]  I'm 17, and I've been watching you for about two years,
[02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:17.200]  and I'm trying to get my dad involved.
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:19.040]  But the only problem is, I've showed him
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:20.600]  some of your documentaries,
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:23.200]  and he falls asleep in the middle of them,
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:25.520]  or he just doesn't, he's not interested.
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:27.120]  And every time I try to tell him, you know,
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:29.000]  breaking news story, he laughs it off.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.920]  He knows the government's corrupt,
[02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:32.720]  but he just feels so powerless,
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:34.200]  like he can't do anything.
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:35.960]  And, you know, he spent 20 years in the military,
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:38.000]  and I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:39.040]  But it kind of saddens me,
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:41.640]  because I want him on my team, and I want to prepare.
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:45.080]  Well, look, it's always hard for a father to listen
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:48.160]  to his son, and for parents to respect their children.
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:50.440]  That's just the way it is, okay?
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:53.080]  I mean, even if you become more successful
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:55.600]  than your parents, a lot of times, they're just geared.
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:54:59.840]  Family is the hardest to sell, ideas are a vacuum cleaner.
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:01.520]  Any salesman will tell you that.
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:02.800]  Any politician will tell you that.
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:04.440]  Any psychologist will tell you that.
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:07.400]  So just move on, try to wake up others,
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:09.160]  and then as things begin to unfold,
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:11.600]  your dad will remember it and respect you.
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:13.720]  But you've got to excel at a bunch of other stuff
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:16.480]  before you start telling him political ideas,
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:18.360]  because they tend to think, oh, youth are being filled
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:20.600]  full of these ideas and stuff.
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:22.000]  But I mean, all you're doing is repeating
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.520]  what the Founding Fathers would talk about.
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:26.320]  It's common sense, it's the rediscovery of that.
[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:28.040]  Love your dad, I'm sure he's a great guy.
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:29.600]  He says he knows it's corrupt.
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:31.560]  He does have a feeling of helplessness.
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:34.320]  So go out and show him, start a local radio show,
[02:55:34.320 --> 02:55:36.560]  start a podcast, start doing your own videos.
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:39.720]  Start getting thousands of people to watch him.
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:42.080]  Talk about issues, go out and do your own reports,
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:44.920]  and then he'll start to listen to you
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:47.000]  if you want to get your dad awake.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:48.960]  But listen, most people sit on the fence
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:49.800]  even if they're awake.
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:51.920]  It's always minorities on the side of evil,
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:53.600]  and minorities on the side of good,
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:55.080]  and that's where the battle is.
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:57.280]  That's why they always want to make you feel powerless.
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:56:00.840]  The truth is, you just got to stop caring, not have fear.
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:02.760]  That means not fear of what your neighbors think.
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:04.400]  When you get to my level, it's fear of attack,
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:05.880]  fear of death, fear of whatever,
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:08.000]  and just make it all a big joke.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.960]  I mean, of the jokes on them,
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:12.560]  all their fear, all their garbage, all of it,
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:14.560]  I'm just not partaking in it.
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:16.160]  I mean, I've got my afterburners on,
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:18.080]  that's the end of it, and this feels good.
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:19.280]  I'm on the right side of history,
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:21.120]  so bombs away in the Info War.
[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:22.880]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.240]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Kim in Florida.
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:27.480]  Kim, you're on the air.
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:30.280]  Hi. Hi.
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:31.840]  Hi, this is my first time calling too,
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:34.040]  so I'm kind of nervous like the last caller was.
[02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:35.440]  Well, don't be nervous there.
[02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:39.360]  Okay, well, I've only been watching some of your,
[02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:40.840]  I've never listened to you live on the radio,
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:43.360]  I've just watched some of the Info Wars,
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:47.000]  things on YouTube, and the 9-Eleven Truths thing,
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.640]  I'm really interested in a lot.
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.960]  But I caught just the tail end of the guy talking about,
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:54.800]  David, your last guest there,
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:57.360]  he was talking about that Army doc, what was that?
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:56:58.200]  I missed that whole call.
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:00.320]  Yes, man, that's AstoriaInfoWars.com,
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:02.080]  that really should be red-linked.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:06.960]  The Army admits there's a plan for reeducation camps
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:09.960]  and brainwashing and stuff for the American people.
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:12.040]  I mean, they admit the documents real,
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:13.640]  then they engage in a style,
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:15.080]  the total to stay with the American people
[02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:16.680]  and say it isn't for the US,
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:19.760]  even though it says it more than 30 times in the document.
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:22.720]  So the article is at infowars.com.
[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:25.320]  Army admits redacted, excuse me,
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:27.920]  Army admits a reeducation camp manual
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:30.640]  not intended for public release.
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:34.200]  So there it is, infowars.com is the coordinates.
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.240]  Now also, since I'm new to all this,
[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:39.560]  and I'm trying to talk to my husband about it,
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.800]  he's also ex-military, like the last caller,
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:44.920]  is there a timeline that you have
[02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:48.680]  that I could access anywhere that shows like,
[02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:50.240]  okay, what was like some of the first things
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:51.960]  that happened that made you wake up?
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:53.640]  Ooh, that's a really good idea.
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:56.240]  We've done some of those before in general history,
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:58.640]  but we need a timeline of the police state
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:02.080]  globalist takeover and how they're doing at great point.
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:03.440]  We'll try to do that sometime next week
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:06.680]  on the Nightly News and air it here on the radio.
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:09.440]  Fabulous, fabulous idea.
